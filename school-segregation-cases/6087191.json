Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nSPERANZA, Judge:\n    A military judge, sitting as a general court-martial, convicted Appellant,\ncontrary to his pleas, of providing alcohol to minors on divers occasions;\nwrongfully distributing marijuana on divers occasions; wrongfully distrib-\nuting psilocybin (mushrooms) on divers occasions; wrongfully using mush-\nrooms on divers occasions; sexually assaulting a child, GB; 1 behaving in a\ndisgraceful and dishonorable manner that seriously compromised his stand-\ning as an officer by wrongfully and dishonorably organizing individuals into a\nviolent gang; wrongfully communicating a threat to AL on divers occasions;\nwrongfully communicating to MH a threat to injure ME by paying someone to\nassault ME; receiving consideration for arranging for KW, PW, WK, and oth-\ner unnamed persons to engage in sexual intercourse with others; unlawfully\nentering ML’s house; sexually assaulting a child, FT; 2 wrongfully threatening\nto hurt, injure, or kill Captain (Capt) CM; wrongfully threatening to hurt, in-\njure, or kill Special Agent (SA) JG; and wrongfully threatening to hurt, in-\njure, or kill Airman Basic (AB) JS, in violation of Articles 92, 112a, 120b, 133,\nand 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. §§ 892, 912a,\n920b, 933, 934. 3 The military judge sentenced Appellant to a dismissal, con-\nfinement for 25 years, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. The military\n\n\n\n1 The military judge found Appellant not guilty pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial\n(R.C.M.) 917 of raping GB in violation of Article 120b,UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 920b, but\nconvicted Appellant of the lesser-included offense of sexual assault, also in violation\nof Article 120b, UCMJ.\n2 The military judge found Appellant not guilty pursuant to R.C.M. 917 of raping FT\nin violation of Article 120b, UCMJ, but convicted Appellant of the lesser-included of-\nfense of sexual assault, also in violation of Article 120b, UCMJ.\n3 The military judge acquitted Appellant of conspiracy to pander; distribution of\nmethamphetamine; distribution of heroin; distribution of Vicodin; distribution of ec-\nstasy; distribution of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); sexual assault of KW by ad-\nministering KW a drug or intoxicant; sexual assault of KW by encouraging an un-\nknown individual to commit a sexual act upon KW by administering KW a drug or\nintoxicant; conduct unbecoming an officer for organizing individuals under the age of\n18 years to have sex for hire; obstruction of justice by requesting Airman Basic (AB)\nJS have others give AL marijuana or cash if she refused to testify or “have others\nbeat her up or kill her if she refused the offer”; obstruction of justice by requesting\nAB ET have others give AL marijuana or cash if she refused to testify or “have others\nbeat her up or kill her if she refused the offer”; and communicating a threat to hurt,\ninjure, or kill AB JS. The military judge granted the Defense’s motion for a finding of\nnot guilty pursuant to R.C.M. 917 and found Appellant not guilty of raping FT. Ap-\npellant was also found guilty by several exceptions and substitutions.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\njudge credited Appellant with 60 days of pretrial confinement credit. The\nconvening authority approved the adjudged sentence.\n    On appeal, Appellant argues that all of his convictions, except his provi-\nsion of alcohol to minors, distribution of marijuana, mushroom use, and\nthreats to AL, are legally and factually insufficient. 4 Appellant also claims\nthe Government failed to meet its discovery obligations; 5 he was deprived his\nconstitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at trial; 6 the military\njudge erred in not granting additional sentencing credit for pretrial punish-\nment Appellant suffered during a search of his pretrial confinement sleeping\nquarters; and post-trial delays in his case warrant meaningful relief.\n    We find there is insufficient evidence to support Appellant’s conviction of\nunlawful entry. We also find that Appellant was subjected to pretrial pun-\nishment in violation of Article 13, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 813, and is, therefore,\nentitled to additional, modest confinement credit. We find no other prejudi-\ncial error, affirm the remaining findings, and reassess the sentence below.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n   Appellant and at least one other local civilian criminal decided to form a\n“Crips” gang in Minot, North Dakota. Appellant—referred to by the gang\nmembers and their associates as “Captain”—became the self-proclaimed\nleader, or “OG,” of this gang, whose criminal enterprise tended to revolve\naround local teenage girls.\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\nA. Legal and Factual Sufficiency\n    Appellant essentially maintains that most of his convictions were ob-\ntained through the testimony of unbelievable witnesses and the judge’s mis-\ninterpretation of the evidence, to include his recorded pretrial confinement\nconversations. However, the law, and indeed the facts of this case, cause us to\ndecline Appellant’s claims and find all but one of his convictions legally and\nfactually sufficient for the reasons discussed below.\n\n\n\n\n4The legal and factual sufficiency of Appellant’s distribution of mushrooms on divers\noccasions is raised pursuant to United States v. Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982).\n5   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431.\n6   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    We have a statutory mandate to “conduct a de novo review of both the le-\ngal and factual sufficiency of a conviction.” United States v. Walters, 58 M.J.\n391, 395 (C.A.A.F. 2003).\n    The test for legal sufficiency of the evidence is “whether, considering the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfind-\ner could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nUnited States v. Turner, 25 M.J. 324, 324 (C.M.A. 1987); see also United\nStates v. Humpherys, 57 M.J. 83, 94 (C.A.A.F. 2002). The “reasonable doubt”\nstandard does not require that the evidence be free from conflict. United\nStates v. Lips, 22 M.J. 679, 684 (A.F.C.M.R. 1986). “[I]n resolving questions of\nlegal sufficiency, we are bound to draw every reasonable inference from the\nevidence of record in favor of the prosecution.” United States v. Barner, 56\nM.J. 131, 134 (C.A.A.F. 2001). The question, therefore, is whether “a reason-\nable factfinder reading the evidence one way could have found all the ele-\nments of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Gutierrez,\n73 M.J. 172, 175 (C.A.A.F. 2014) (quoting United States v. Oliver, 70 M.J. 64,\n68 (C.A.A.F. 2011)).\n    The test for factual sufficiency is “whether, after weighing the evidence in\nthe record of trial and making allowances for not having personally observed\nthe witnesses, [we are] convinced of the [appellant]’s guilt beyond a reasona-\nble doubt.” Turner, 25 M.J. at 325; see also United States v. Reed, 54 M.J. 37,\n41 (C.A.A.F. 2000). In conducting this unique appellate role, we take “a fresh,\nimpartial look at the evidence,” applying “neither a presumption of innocence\nnor a presumption of guilt” to “make [our] own independent determination as\nto whether the evidence constitutes proof of each required element beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” United States v. Washington, 57 M.J. 394, 399.\n   1. Sexual Assault of GB\n   The military judge convicted Appellant of sexual assault of a child for\npenetrating GB’s vulva with his penis when, at the time, GB was only 15\nyears old. Appellant committed this offense during a multi-day party he host-\ned—the “Project X” party. GB went to this party with her teenage friends,\nKW and KH. Another teenage girl, AL, met GB at the party. GB, KH, KW,\nand AL testified at trial.\n   At the time of the party, KW had known Appellant for several months.\nKW testified that at the party she told Appellant GB’s age. KW described\nwalking into Appellant’s bedroom and seeing Appellant having sexual inter-\ncourse with GB. She recounted Appellant and GB being naked with Appel-\nlant on top.\n    GB explained that she met Appellant at this party when she was 15 years\nold. At the party, GB got extremely drunk. She remembered only “flashbacks”\n\n\n                                       4\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nof the evening through the next morning. In pertinent part, GB recounted\nspending time with Appellant in his living room, being on Appellant’s bed\nand picking her bra up off of the bedroom floor, waking up in the morning\nwith her clothes on and nobody else in the bedroom, returning to the down-\nstairs, and “start[ing] the party again.”\n    KH turned 16 years old the same month as the “Project X” party. She too\nfirst met Appellant at the party. KH described “hanging out” and “drinking\nwhen [Appellant] brought the booze home.” KH described GB as “really\ndrunk” and “puking everywhere.” KH observed Appellant and GB together on\na couch, Appellant telling GB she was “really pretty,” Appellant and GB\n“making out,” and the two eventually going upstairs. KH also described see-\ning GB the next morning in Appellant’s bedroom, GB’s clothes on the floor,\nand GB naked except for a bedsheet. Appellant was in the bathroom at the\ntime.\n    AL met Appellant at the “Project X” party. AL described GB as being\n“trashed” the first evening of the party. AL also recounted a conversation she\nhad with Appellant the next day during which Appellant admitted to having\nsex with GB and claimed “he would have got [sic] her pregnant if he hadn’t\ngot [sic] the Plan B pill . . . .” Appellant later became GB’s boyfriend and ex-\nchanged text messages with AL related to his relationship with GB. Appel-\nlant’s text message communications with AL included the following:\n   [Appellant:] Did [GB] tell you I got her prego? Lol\n   [AL:] The night of ur party??\n   [Appellant:] Another time.\n    As Appellant notes on appeal, each of these witnesses was thoroughly\ncross-examined by Appellant’s trial defense counsel. Nonetheless, Appellant\nargues that his conviction of this offense is neither legally nor factually suffi-\ncient because “penetration was not proven,” “KW lacked credibility,” and\n“KH’s testimony is not credible.” The military judge determined otherwise, at\nleast with respect to this offense. Considering the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution and drawing every reasonable inference from the\nevidence in favor of the prosecution, we find a reasonable factfinder could\nhave found all the essential elements of this offense beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Moreover, after weighing the evidence presented at trial regarding\nAppellant’s sexual assault of GB and making allowances for not having ob-\nserved the witnesses who testified as to this offense, we are convinced beyond\na reasonable doubt Appellant sexually assaulted a child, GB, by penetrating\nGB’s vulva with his penis.\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n   2. Sexual Assault of FT\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of sexually assaulting FT, a child\nwho was only 14 years old at the time, by penetrating FT’s vulva with his pe-\nnis, between on or about 1 September 2013 and on or about 30 October 2013.\nFT did not testify at trial. FT’s brother—JP—and KW testified. In addition,\nJG and AB DE testified about incriminating statements and admissions Ap-\npellant made to them while they were confined together during Appellant’s\npretrial confinement at Minot Air Force Base (AFB), North Dakota. Audio\nrecordings of Appellant’s pretrial confinement conversations were also admit-\nted into evidence.\n    JP testified he met Appellant at a party at Appellant’s home approximate-\nly one year after the “Project X” party. While at the party, JP recounted over-\nhearing Appellant tell other partygoers that FT “f[***]s like a boss.” JP told\nAppellant that his sister, FT, was only 14 years old. According to JP, Appel-\nlant was “shocked and appalled” and told JP that “he thought she was 17.”\n    KW introduced FT to Appellant and told Appellant FT’s age—younger\nthan 15 years old at the time. On direct examination, trial counsel asked KW\nif there was “anything physical between [FT] and [Appellant].” KW testified\nthat, near the end of 2013, she walked into Appellant’s bedroom and wit-\nnessed Appellant and FT naked on Appellant’s bed with Appellant on top of\nFT having sex with her.\n    Appellant was in pretrial confinement with JG, a former military member\nwho was then serving post-trial confinement. JG described Appellant’s\nstatements about FT as follows:\n       Q. Did [Appellant] ever talk about an individual named [FT]?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. What did he say about [FT]?\n       A. I guess one night they were throwing a party and [FT] came\n       over. They were drinking and she asked [Appellant] and the\n       other people, the other gang members there, what it takes to\n       get into the gang and they told her that they would have to\n       sleep with her to get into the gang. I guess that [Appellant]\n       said her and three, including him, went up to a bedroom and\n       slept with her. I guess [Appellant] went first followed by [one\n       gang member] and then some other guy who I don’t know the\n       name of.\n       Q. That’s what [Appellant] told you?\n       A. Yes.\n\n\n                                      6\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. Did [Appellant] say how old [FT] was?\n       A. At the time she was 14.\n       Q. Did [Appellant] say specifically what happened that night\n       with [FT]?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Okay, what did he say?\n       A. He said that they had sex, that he went first. [One gang\n       member] went second, and the other guy went third to get her\n       into the gang.\n    AB DE knew Appellant well before they spent time together in confine-\nment. Apart from describing Appellant’s involvement with alcohol, drugs,\nthreats, and GB, AB DE recounted Appellant explaining that KW “would\nbring girls over to have him sleep with,” and “in the military ‘of age’ is 16,\nand he doesn’t ask their age anyway.” AB DE also described comments Appel-\nlant made about FT in pretrial confinement. According to AB DE, the con-\nfinees were listing people they found attractive and FT’s name was listed.\nAppellant stated. “Oh, [FT] that’s the other girl that I got the abortion for.”\nAB DE responded that “She’s got to be like 17 or 18.” AB DE testified that\nAppellant then clarified “No, she was 14 at the time.” AB DE continued to\nrecount Appellant’s discussion of FT that included the following general\nstatements or admissions: FT was drunk the first time Appellant had sex\nwith her; “the first time she was joining the gang so three of the gang mem-\nbers had sex with her; and the second time was when [Appellant] got her\npregnant.” (Emphasis added).\n    The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) placed a recording\ndevice inside the confinement facility to capture Appellant’s conversations\nwith the other confinees. In one recording, the confinees joke about Appel-\nlant’s “Project X” party—“[w]hat do you call a bunch of 15-year-old girls par-\ntying at a house? . . . [Appellant’s] Project X party.” This leads to the follow-\ning exchange, evidently referring to [FT]:\n       [Appellant:] I wasn’t even sure if it was me that got her preg-\n       nant. She got f[****]d by three dudes on the same f[***]in\n       night.\n       [Confinee:] You must feel responsible if you took her to the\n       abortion clinic.\n       [Confinee:] Brown, you promote the degradation of our youth.\n       [Appellant:] I’m doing them a favor.\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       [Confinee:] The f[**]k you are. How are you doing a 14-year-\n       old-girl a favor by knocking her up, feeding her drugs, and then\n       taking her to the Red River abortion clinic?\n       [Confinee:] So, if a 14 year old gets off, if you just happen to be\n       driving by ----\n       [Appellant:] She said she was f[*****]n 17.\nAn excerpt of another recording contained the following statement Appellant\nmade about FT:\n       When I f[*****]d [FT] I really did not know her age. I really\n       thought she was 17, because she f[*****]d like she was older\n       ...\n       She was getting gang f[****]d. She f[****]d me and then after\n       [one gang member] f[****]d her, and then [another] f[****]d\n       her, and then she was like [inaudible].”\n       [Another confinee asks Appellant] And she’s 15?\n       [Appellant responds] Yep.\n    Appellant was originally charged with raping FT, a child, for penetrating\nher vulva with his penis by using force against her, to wit: holding her down\nwith his arms. After the Government rested its findings case, the Defense\nmoved for finding of not guilty of this specification pursuant to Rule for\nCourts-Martial (R.C.M.) 917. Trial defense counsel maintained, “On this\nthere has been [no] evidence whatsoever that Captain Brown used force to\nwit: holding [FT] down with his arms at any point while they were having\nsex.” The Government agreed with the Defense’s assessment, with trial coun-\nsel stating:\n       there was no independent evidence of force because [FT] was\n       not present or testified about that. We do believe there is a\n       lesser included offense. So as to the greater offense of force it is\n       our position that we agree. To the lesser included offense of\n       sexual assault of a child, there is evidence.\nAppellant was convicted of this lesser-included offense.\n    Appellant was originally charged with another specification of raping FT,\na child, which alleged Appellant penetrated FT’s vulva with his penis by ad-\nministering to her a drug, intoxicant or other similar substance. After the\nGovernment rested its findings case, the Defense moved for a finding of not\nguilty of this offense pursuant to R.C.M. 917. Again, the Government agreed\nand the following exchange occurred between the military judge and trial\ncounsel:\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                    United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       STC: And we agree with defense on [the rape by administering\n       a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance specification],\n       that there has not been independent evidence of that specifica-\n       tion as far as [FT]. There was only one incident talked about by\n       multiple witnesses. The audio disagrees, but there is no inde-\n       pendent evidence, so we agree.\n       MJ: And that was to all of the entire specification?\n       STC: To all of [this specification] because I don’t think there is\n       independent evidence of two incidents. There is just one inci-\n       dent.\nAccordingly, the military judge granted the defense motion and found Appel-\nlant not guilty of raping FT by administering her a drug, intoxicant or other\nsimilar substance.\n    Appellant argues that his conviction of sexually assaulting FT is legally\nand factually insufficient because “[t]he only potentially credible evidence\nsupporting this specification came from testimony provided by JP, FT’s\nbrother, and statements purportedly made by [Appellant], admitting to sexu-\nal intercourse with FT.” Appellant also argues that his statements evidenced\nhis “belief that FT was 17 years old, not 14 years old as testified to by her\nbrother.” Accordingly, Appellant maintains, “There was no credible evidence\nthat [Appellant] knew or believed that FT was 14 years old at the time any\nalleged sexual acts may have taken place.” Appellant also claims, “There is\nno evidence corroborating penetration.” Appellant further explains that JP’s\n“story . . . does not make sense,” because “[i]t makes no sense that JP would\nnot confront [Appellant] if this really happened . . . [,] nor did he tell his par-\nents or report it to the police.” Finally, Appellant reasons that “[t]o the extent\nthe government relies on any testimony by KW regarding sexual acts be-\ntween [Appellant] and FT, KW’s credibility has been sufficiently chal-\nlenged . . . .”\n    While we acknowledge the military judge acquitted Appellant of several\ncharges to which KW was the primary—if not the only—witness, we are\nnonetheless mindful that the military judge “may believe one part of a wit-\nness’ testimony and disbelieve another.” United States v. Harris, 8 M.J. 52,\n59 (C.M.A. 1979). Accordingly, Appellant’s view that the military judge’s find-\nings necessarily render KW’s entire testimony unbelievable is misplaced. In-\ndeed, after considering the evidence and all reasonable inference in a light\nmost favorable the prosecution, we find that the military judge—a rational\nfactfinder presumed to know the law—could have found beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that Appellant was not either subjectively or objectively mistaken\nabout FT’s age and penetrated FT’s vulva with his penis. Additionally, after\n\n\n                                        9\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nweighing the evidence presented at trial regarding Appellant’s sexual assault\nof FT and making allowances for not having observed the witnesses who tes-\ntified as to this offense, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt Appel-\nlant sexually assaulted a child, FT, by penetrating FT’s vulva with his penis.\n   3. Organizing a Violent Gang\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of the following offense, in viola-\ntion of Article 133, UCMJ:\n       [Appellant did] behave in a manner that disgraced and dishon-\n       ored [Appellant] and seriously compromised his standing as a\n       commissioned officer by wrongfully and dishonorably organiz-\n       ing individuals into a violent gang, to the disgrace of the armed\n       forces.\nAppellant, along with his gang member associates, dressed in their gang col-\nor, blue. Blue clothing and blue bandanas were found at Appellant’s residence\nalong with a picture on Appellant’s wall that read “Crips for Life” next to his\nname “Leon.” Multiple, if not all, witnesses testified, in some respect, about\nAppellant’s gang-related activities, as well as his leadership role within the\n“Crips” gang. Indeed, Appellant’s own statements confirmed his role within\nthe gang and detailed his participation in its activities.\n    Accordingly, the evidence presented at trial caused Appellant on appeal to\n“concede[] that the evidence demonstrates multiple claims by friends and\nother inmates that [Appellant] was involved in ‘gang’ activity.” However, Ap-\npellant claims that the “challenge” for us “is determining whether [Appellant]\nwas engaged in hyperbole and bravado while hanging out with under-aged\nfemales and others, whether friends or fellow inmates, that he was trying to\nimpress.” Appellant also asserts that “there was no credible evidence of any\n‘violent’ activity as alleged.” In support of his argument, Appellant once again\nattacks the credibility of witnesses and maintains that his incriminating\nstatements were merely “hyperbole and fiction to impress other inmates.”\n    After considering the evidence of this offense and all reasonable infer-\nences in a light most favorable to the prosecution, finding Appellant’s convic-\ntion of wrongfully and dishonorably organizing a violent gang legally suffi-\ncient is not a particularly difficult challenge. Appellant fancied himself the\nleader of a criminal enterprise and, at times, exaggerated his and his gang’s\nexploits while trying to “impress” his fellow inmates, who were all enlisted\nmembers. Appellant’s statements, as described by witnesses, included his\nboast that his gang called him “OG, King Cold” and that he directed all of the\ngang’s activities. Appellant also explained that in order to join the gang,\nmales had to get beaten up by the gang members and females had to have\nsexual intercourse with three gang members. Appellant also admitted that\n\n\n                                      10\n\f                  United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nhis gang would “rob people, break into schools, [and] they broke [KW]’s win-\ndow.” Appellant’s claims were corroborated by testimony describing threats\nand destruction of property. The military judge, as a reasonable factfinder,\ncould have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant organized a vio-\nlent gang. Moreover, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Appel-\nlant organized this so-called “Crips” gang, he was the unquestioned leader of\nthe gang, his gang was violent, and that he is guilty of this Article 133 of-\nfense.\n   4. Prostitution Ring\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of the following offense, in viola-\ntion of Article 134, UCMJ:\n       [Appellant did] wrongfully receive valuable consideration, to\n       wit: money, on account of arranging for K.W., P.W., W.K., and\n       other unnamed persons to engage in acts of sexual intercourse\n       with unnamed persons, which conduct, under the circumstanc-\n       es, was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n    Appellant described his gang’s main activities as “drugs, prostitution,\n[and] burglary,” according to JG. With regard to the “prostitution ring,” JG\ntestified, on direct examination from trial counsel:\n       Q. Did he talk about what his involvement would be with the\n       drugs and prostitution? What would be his involvement with\n       that?\n       A. He would basically just run things behind the scenes. He\n       would let his gang members actually deal hands-on.\n       Q. Did he talk about whether he made the decisions?\n       A. Yes, he said that anything that goes on in his gang is run\n       through him first.\n       ....\n       Q. Did you hear anything about prostitution?\n       A. Yes, they had a prostitution ring, and they had girls ranging\n       in ages from 15 to 21. The younger girls would bring in. . .\n       They would charge more for the younger girls. It was kind of\n       run with him and a girl called [WK], who goes by Nona. She\n       kind of headed that up. I am not sure how they recruited the\n       girls or anything like that.\n       ....\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. Did he talk about what the money exchange would be for the\n       prostitution?\n       A. Like $300.00 to $800.00.\n       Q. Sorry?\n       A. $300.00 to $800.00. The younger girls would bring in more\n       money, so they would get charged more.\n    JG testified during cross-examination that Appellant indicated that he re-\nceived a 70 percent cut on all money the gang received from prostitution. Fur-\nther, AB DE testified that Appellant stated that “they ran a prostitution ring,\nthat people would come over to his house and there was girls named Nona\nand Kiki who were the prostitutes and possibly [KW]; and guys would pay\nhim to sleep with them.”\n    In addition, KW testified about witnessing people pay Appellant to have\nsex with her and on another occasion TW. KH testified about WK’s role as a\nprostitute in Appellant’s gang and how Appellant provided WK money “like it\nwas a job . . . .” TS testified that WK was a member of Appellant’s gang. TS\nalso described on direct examination how Appellant’s, and the gang’s, second-\nin-charge, CM, approached her about a “prostitution ring:”\n       Q. What was approached to you about this prostitution ring?\n       A. Just being the head person, like the head girl in the house.\n       Q. What would be your responsibilities for being the head girl\n       in the house?\n       A. Make sure that they brought the money back to him, and\n       make sure that they were actually doing what they were told\n       to.\n       Q. Did you agree to that?\n       A. No, sir.\n   The prosecution also presented an audio recording of the following con-\nversation between Appellant and another confinee, AB JS: 7\n       [AB JS:] Were you running prostitution?\n\n\n7While discussing this conversation in his Reply Brief to the Government Answer to\nCourt Order, dated 5 May 2017, Appellant states “Given the timing, it is unclear\nwhat Appellant is referencing; admittedly, it could indeed be that he had run his own\nprostitution ring.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       [Appellant:] What?\n       [AB JS:] Were you dealing with prostitution?\n       [Appellant:] Oh yeah, I guess some girl’s angry dad knew and\n       f[****]n went to OSI.\n       [AB JS:] I heard—I heard that’s pretty big up here.\n       [Appellant:] Yeah it is; also one of those, um, one of those grain\n       silos, they were running a ring inside one of them and the cops\n       busted it.\n       [Banter by several individuals at once.]\n       [Appellant:] S[**]t, I had girls from 16 to 21.\n       [AB JS:] Yeah?\n       [Appellant:] Yeah.\n    In challenging the legal and factually sufficiency of this conviction, “[Ap-\npellant] does not dispute that multiple witnesses testified about his purport-\ned involvement in gang activity. The dispute is that there was no credible ev-\nidence of violence [sic] or that, as argued below, his alleged involvement was\nanything more than empty boasting.” Appellant maintains there is “absolute-\nly no credible evidence whatsoever of any prostitution activity or of any ‘mon-\ney exchange’. . . .[T]here is no money, no arrests, and no name of the alleged\n‘John’ in [the PW] incident.” Most importantly to Appellant, PW did not testi-\nfy. In addition, Appellant again argues “KW’s testimony has already been\ndiscredited by the military judge’s findings with respect to her claims.” Appel-\nlant furthers his argument by citing his acquittal of conspiracy to engage in\npandering and challenging the credibility of witnesses.\n    Once again, we view the evidence of this offense and all reasonable infer-\nence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. Once again, we find Appel-\nlant’s conviction legally sufficient. The military judge in this case could rea-\nsonably have found Appellant’s admissions to be corroborated by witness tes-\ntimony. The military judge could have properly believed some portions of the\nwitnesses’ testimony and not others. Accordingly, the military judge as fact-\nfinder could have reasonably found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant\nwas arranging for KW, PW, WK, and others to have sex with people who paid\nhim money and that such conduct was of a nature to bring discredit upon the\narmed forces. Moreover, we a convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Ap-\npellant is guilty of arranging a service-discrediting “prostitution ring.”\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n   5. Communicating Threats\n   The military judge convicted Appellant of threatening to injure ME by\npaying someone to assault ME and threatening to hurt, injure, or kill Capt\nCM and SA JG.\n   ME was one of Appellant’s roommates. AL testified that she heard Appel-\nlant say “he had a hit out or he wanted to like get a hit out for [ME]” because\nAppellant thought ME had called law enforcement on him. Senior Airman\n(SrA) MH, who was Appellant’s friend, overheard Appellant “saying that he\nwas looking to find or pay someone to beat [ME] up.” MB, who was confined\nwith Appellant, recounted Appellant making statements about ME:\n       He didn’t say whether—I can’t remember whether [ME] owed\n       him money or somebody said that that he put out a bounty on\n       [ME] because [Appellant] wanted to get it taken care of, but\n       whatever the situation happened between those two, [Appel-\n       lant] put a bounty out and the guy ended up getting in a fight\n       or got beat up. But he didn’t know who did it, so it was never\n       paid out, so it kind of just happened.\nAB DE further testified, “[Appellant] had offered me, [Appellant] came to my\nhouse and offered me; [Appellant] said ‘I’ll give you $5,000 to anyone that\nhurts [ME] or puts him in the hospital.” Appellant was also recorded in con-\nfinement telling AB DE, “Him, her and [ME], remember that f[****]r I offered\n$5,000.00 . . . .”\n   While in pretrial confinement, Appellant also made a variety of threats\nagainst one of the prosecutors, Capt CM, and one of the investigators, SA JG,\nthat were communicated to, or overheard by fellow inmates, JG, MB, and AB\nDE. Although JG characterized Appellant as “venting,” Appellant was rec-\norded in pretrial confinement surmising, “I think communicating a threat is\nmy biggest problem.”\n   On appeal and consistent with his realization in pretrial confinement,\nAppellant concludes, “It must be conceded that the evidence demonstrates\nmultiple statements which support the government’s arguments that [Appel-\nlant] made threats about others.” Nevertheless, Appellant maintains that\nsomebody else threatened ME and that his threats against Capt CM and SA\nJG were made “in jest.”\n    Appellant’s convictions of threatening ME, Capt CM, and SA JG are legal-\nly sufficient. After viewing the evidence of these convictions in a light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, we reach the conclusion that a rational factfind-\ner could have found the essential elements of communicating a threat beyond\na reasonable doubt. We also find Appellant’s convictions factually sufficient,\n\n\n\n                                      14\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nas we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant communicated\nthreats against ME, Capt CM, and SA JG.\n   6. Unlawfully Entering ML’s Home\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of unlawfully entering ML’s dwell-\ning in December 2013.\n    Appellant maintained a relationship with AL, during which time he gave\nher his social security card, blank checks, birth certificate, and car keys. Ap-\npellant also bought AL a ring, “pipes,” and “bongs.” ML is AL’s mother. AL\nlived with ML in Berthold, North Dakota. Appellant would pick AL up from\nher home. AL eventually ended the relationship causing Appellant to request\nAL return his “stuff.” AL blocked Appellant’s phone number on her phone,\nwhich prevented her from receiving text messages directly from Appellant’s\nphone number.\n    ML and AL testified about AL’s relationship with Appellant, ML return-\ning some of Appellant’s items to him, and threatening messages AL received\nin October 2013 after the relationship ended. AL received these text messag-\nes on her mobile phone through “TextNow.com”:\n       Give me my stuff back please\n       I’m trying to be nice\n       If you Dont [sic] you have no idea.......test me\n       Nobody will ever give u [sh*t] until I get my stuff back I prom-\n       ise you… I will use every resource I have ever\n       I HATE you\n       OK its war b[***]h\n       ....\n       Are you gonna bring my things please?\n       ....\n       well when u do plz get me all my stuff back please including\n       the ring thanks\n       (1/3) If you Dont [sic] give me my things including the ring by\n       TOMORROW I promise some girls will go to you and get it and\n       they will kick your\n       (2/3) ass.. its been arranged already and you know I have the\n       influence to make it happen…good luck using another guy for\n       weed again\n       (3/3) half the town knows how u f[***]ed me over\n\n                                       15\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    During trial, particularly when the prosecution laid the evidentiary foun-\ndation for admission of the text messages, inconsistencies arose as to when\nML returned items to Appellant. ML testified that she personally returned\nitems to Appellant before AL received the aforementioned text messages. AL\ninitially testified on direct examination as follows:\n       Q. [AL], did your mom ever give anything back to [Appellant],\n       that’s the next step you mentioned?\n       A. Yeah, she gave it all back.\n       Q. Do you remember when that was?\n       A. I am not sure.\n       Q. Was it before or after these text messages, or during these\n       text messages?\n       A. It was after I got them, because I showed her them.\n       Q. So you showed your mom the text messages?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Is that what prompted the stuff being returned?\n       A. Yeah.\nThe Defense identified this conflict and objected, but the military judge ad-\nmitted the exhibit containing the text messages.\n   AL testified on cross-examination, in pertinent part, as follows:\n        Q. All right, now, if I understand, after that you at some point\n       made arrangements with your mom to return property to him,\n       correct?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Why wasn’t that done, if you knew you were going to be\n       breaking up with [Appellant] why was that not done at the\n       time you broke up with him?\n       A. Honestly, I forgot I even had it. It was a bag downstairs, like\n       I didn’t really like look at it every day. It just kind of didn’t\n       cross my mind.\n       Q. How did you end up coming across it, or how did your mom\n       come across it?\n       A. I guess, from what I remember, the text of him saying “I\n       want my stuff back.”\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. So after you get the text “I want my stuff back” then you\n       were thinking about it and you went to find the stuff, correct?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. And the same day you get the te[x]t that “I want my stuff\n       back” did you return the stuff to him?\n       A. I don’t know if it was that exact date, it might have been like\n       the day after.\n       Q. All right, did you ever indicate to him that you were not go-\n       ing to give his stuff back?\n       A. No.\n       Q. As far as when it was turned over to him, were you getting\n       your threats at that particular point, these threatening text\n       messages; or was that after the fact?\n       A. I think the threats came after.\n       Q. Right, so you basically were asked after this break up by\n       [Appellant], “Can I get my stuff back” and what you did is the\n       day after your mom took his stuff back to him, correct?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Did you go with your mom to do that?\n       A. What?\n       Q. Did you go with your mom to do that?\n       A. No.\n       Q. So, when your mom came back did she tell you that she had\n       dropped the stuff off to [Appellant]?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. So at this particular point there had not been any threats\n       yet, correct?\n       A. Not yet.\nThe military judge later clarified AL’s testimony by referencing AL to the text\nmessages:\n       Q. You just testified this morning that you thought it was may-\n       be the day after you received the text about him wanting his\n       stuff back that your mom returned it.\n\n\n\n\n                                      17\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       A. Yeah, but I think we were like out of town. I think we were\n       in Bismarck and I don’t know exactly when she brought it back.\n       I just know it was like not that long after these.\n       Q. You mentioned; did you collect the things for your mom to\n       give them back to him?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Like you got the bag?\n       A. Yeah, they were just already in a bag.\n       Q. What was in the bag?\n       A. Social Security card, birth certificate, and his car keys.\n       Q. What about the ring? Did you return the ring at that time?\n       A. No. I think we like couldn’t find it or something. I am not\n       sure, but it wasn’t given back at that time.\n       Q. Were you aware of anything else that you had that he might\n       have wanted from you?\n       A. Um, I guess the pipes and the bongs he bought me.\n       Q. Were you aware of anyone else wanting something back\n       from you around this time period?\n       A. No.\n    ML testified about “an incident where [her] house was broken into” some-\ntime in mid-December 2013. ML described going home from work around\nlunchtime and “notic[ing] immediately that the door that we have to the\nbasement was open which is normally closed.” ML explained: “So as I walked\nfarther into the entryway I could see upstairs and A[L]’s bedroom door was\nopen, which is never open. And then another bedroom door was open that is\nup there, and then I thought ‘somebody has been in the house.’”\n    ML confirmed that none of her family members had been in the house. Af-\nterwards, ML went upstairs and looked around the house. ML observed that\n“[n]othing looked like it had been touched,” so she went into the basement.\nML felt a draft on her way to the basement and noticed the curtains on the\nbasement window were “blowing.” As she got closer, she observed glass on the\nfloor and that the window had been broken. ML described the window as\nlarge with a plastic covering. ML further described the plastic being “ripped\naway” when “they had kicked the window.” ML explained it was “unusual” for\nAL’s bedroom door be open because “[AL] always keeps her bedroom door\nshut. In fact we keep a lot of the doors shut because we have cats, and we just\nlike to keep them out of there because of her allergies and stuff. So, but her\n\n                                       18\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nbedroom door is always shut anyway, usually.” ML also confirmed that no\nproperty was missing. On cross-examination, ML testified about the size of\nthe hole in the window, claiming “An adult male, I guess I just thought about\n[Appellant] would fit through it. I know we had speculated that maybe he\nhad somebody with [him] or something like that.” ML did not see Appellant\nat or near her home that day.\n   MB testified that he and Appellant discussed Appellant’s pending charges\nwhile they were confined together. On direct examination, MB relevantly re-\ncounted conversations concerning AL as follows:\n       Q. Let’s talk about [AL]. What do you remember him saying\n       about [AL]?\n       A. I guess it was his ex-girlfriend, and I guess they had a break\n       up and he was missing some documents and some things from\n       his place, and pretty much she was the reason why he was in\n       pretrial.\n       ....\n       Q. I want to bring your attention back to [AL]. Did the accused\n       ever mention anything about her home, about breaking into\n       her home?\n       A. He personally said he had nothing to do with it but one of\n       his friends or the number 2 in control, [C], and some guys went\n       over there looking for his stuff. It was never mentioned if any\n       harm was done to her or if she was there, or anything, or if\n       they found anything.\n       Q. When you said number 2 in control or his friend, what did\n       you mean?\n       A. I guess with the whole he’s a Crip, he’s number 2 in his\n       chain of command.\n       Q. What did you understand a Crip to mean?\n       A. A gang member.\nThe military judge also considered an audio-recording of Appellant in pretrial\nconfinement making the following statement: “Oh, Amity helped rob [AL’s]\nhouse; she drove all the way to Berthold to do it.” KW testified that a “girl”\nwith the first name “Amity” lived with Appellant.\n    Appellant argues that “the Government failed to prove that anyone en-\ntered the dwelling house of ML,” and “[m]oreover, even if the evidence—\nviewed in a light most favorable to the Government—demonstrates that\n\n\n\n                                      19\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nsomeone did enter ML’s home, there is no proof that the person was Appel-\nlant or someone he instructed to carry out the crime.”\n    It is apparent from the record, Appellant was convicted of this offense as a\nprincipal. See Article 77, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 877; see also R.C.M. 307, Discus-\nsion (H)(i) (“All principals are charged as if each was the perpetrator.”). A\nreasonable factfinder could find likewise. The evidence and all reasonable in-\nferences—when viewed and drawn in a light most favorable to the Prosecu-\ntion—establish Appellant’s motivation for unlawfully entering ML’s home,\nhis intent to do so, and his ability and willingness to command his gang\nmembers to do so. The evidence also suggests that someone broke ML’s\nbasement window causing a hole large enough for a person to enter the home\nand that Appellant admitted a known associate of his, Amity, “helped rob\n[AL’s] house [and] drove all the way to Berthold to do it.” Accordingly, Appel-\nlant’s conviction of unlawful entry is legally sufficient.\n    However, we have taken a “fresh, impartial look” at the evidence of this\noffense and are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant is\nguilty of the offense of unlawful entry. While the evidence establishes the le-\ngal sufficiency of Appellant’s conviction, it also raises several possibilities in-\nconsistent with Appellant’s guilt: that someone other than Appellant’s gang\nmembers entered the house on the occasion ML described; that if members of\nAppellant’s gang did go, it was without Appellant’s involvement; or that no\nentry actually occurred. Therefore, we set aside Appellant’s conviction of un-\nlawful entry and dismiss with prejudice Specification 4 of Charge VII.\n      7. Distribution of “Mushrooms” on Divers Occasions 8\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of distributing some amount of\npsilocybin, “mushrooms,” on divers occasions.\n    KW lived with Appellant for a period of time. She testified, among other\nthings, about receiving mushrooms from Appellant at least five times. She\ndescribed eating small mushrooms that made her feel “crazy, hallucinations.”\n    AL testified about seeing Appellant provide mushrooms to GB. AL de-\nscribed Appellant declaring, “Hey, I have some mushrooms,” possessing\n“three little chocolate mushrooms,” splitting one with GB, and eating a piece\nwith GB. AL recounted Appellant’s reaction to the drug, “He was just saying\nlike that me and [GB] were like witches and that he was scared of us . . . .”\nAppellant text messaged AL about this incident, stating, “Outside I thought I\n\n\n\n8   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431.\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nwas in a forest and you two witches were trying to eat me.” On cross-\nexamination, AL further discussed the mushrooms:\n       Q. Okay. Now let’s talk about those mushrooms that you are\n       saying were ingested. Did you ingest any of those?\n       A. Once, yeah.\n       Q. Okay and what did they look like?\n       A. It was a small circular chocolate, with like, you could see\n       like pieces of shrooms, like in it.\n       Q. Okay and shrooms meaning mushrooms?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Now had you been drinking also?\n       A. No.\n       Q. Is this the time you say you saw Captain Brown use mush-\n       rooms?\n       A. No.\n       Q. A different time?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. When you say you saw him use mushrooms, it was just a to-\n       tally different occasion? What did they look like if you saw\n       them?\n       A. Same thing.\n    During her testimony, GB recounted an incident almost identical to that\ndescribed by AL. GB described Appellant providing her a mushroom\n“wrapped in chocolate” when she visited Appellant with AL. GB also de-\nscribed Appellant looking at her and saying “he felt like he was in a forest or\nsomething and there was a witch.” GB admitted to eating one of the mush-\nrooms Appellant provided, not feeling its effects, and leaving Appellant’s\nhouse for approximately an hour. GB’s testimony on direct examination con-\ntinued, in pertinent part:\n       Q. What happened after an hour?\n       A. I had left his house, went over to another one of my friend’s\n       house and then I went back to his house and I eventually ate\n       another half of one, and then I had gone to Walmart with [AL],\n       and um, the way it hits you is like say if you go to the bathroom\n       for example, which was what I did, it hit me like when I was in\n       the bathroom stall.\n\n                                      21\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. What kind of effects did you feel from it?\n       A. I felt really kind of like woozy and happy and not like. . . I\n       kind of felt like I was floating in a way, like everything was re-\n       ally vibrant and people were staring at me. (Emphasis added).\n    Appellant discussed mushrooms and his distribution to GB in a conversa-\ntion with other confinees that was recorded by investigators:\n       [Appellant:] “Luckily there was never any pictures taken of the\n       f[***]ing huge bag of shrooms that I had. I had shrooms with\n       huge f[***]ing mushrooms caps and s[**]t.”\n       ....\n       [Appellant:] “No. I got [GB] f[***]ed up on shrooms at Walmart\n       once. She ended up getting arrested like a couple of hours later.\n       She was f[***]ed up. That was her first time taking shrooms.\n    Appellant asserts that his conviction for distributing mushrooms “on di-\nvers occasions” is legally and factually insufficient. He acknowledges that\n“[v]arious sources indicate that Appellant provided mushrooms to GB on one\noccasion.” However, Appellant believes “the military judge convicted [him]\nbased on either a misunderstanding regarding the sole distribution or her\nbelief in KW’s testimony.” Accordingly, Appellant renews his unavailing\nclaim that “[a]s a whole, KW’s testimony is too riddled with inconsistencies to\nprove any offense beyond a reasonable doubt. A reasonable factfinder would\ndisregard her testimony in its entirety . . . .”\n    Even if a reasonable factfinder disregarded KW’s testimony about Appel-\nlant’s distribution of mushrooms to her, a reasonable factfinder could have\nnonetheless convicted Appellant of distribution of mushrooms on divers occa-\nsions. Appellant concedes one distribution to GB. When viewing the evidence\nand all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a\nreasonable factfinder could have also found beyond a reasonable doubt that\nAppellant distributed mushrooms to AL, and when GB returned to his house\nafter leaving for approximately on hour and ate another half of a mushroom,\nAppellant made a second, separate distribution to GB. Unfortunately for Ap-\npellant, the military judge, as a reasonable factfinder may have properly be-\nlieved KW’s testimony regarding Appellant’s mushroom distribution despite\nher findings on other charged misconduct. Accordingly, we answer the ques-\ntion of whether a reasonable factfinder hearing the evidence of Appellant’s\nmushroom distribution one way could have found Appellant guilty of distrib-\nuting mushrooms on divers occasions in the affirmative; Appellant’s convic-\ntion is legally sufficient. Moreover, like the military judge, we are convinced\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant distributed mushrooms on two or\nmore occasions; Appellant’s conviction is factually sufficient.\n\n                                      22\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nB. Discovery 9\n   Appellant asserts a discovery violation regarding one of the witnesses, AB\nDE, who testified against him. AB DE joined the Air Force in 2010. Approxi-\nmately two years later in 2012, he met Appellant in Minot, North Dakota. AB\nDE and Appellant had a mutual friend and AB DE would frequently “hang\nout” with Appellant.\n    In May 2012, AB DE was detained at a local Walmart for shoplifting. The\nresponding officer asked AB DE about his age. AB DE replied that he was 18\nyears old. After the officer continued his efforts to confirm AB DE’s identity\nand age, AB DE informed the officer that he was actually 20 years old and\nhad provided the wrong birth date earlier. AB DE was arrested for shoplift-\ning and providing false information. AB DE was ordered to appear in local\ncourt a few days later for the charge of false information; however, the charge\nwas dismissed by the county’s prosecuting attorney because the “AF is taking\n[jurisdiction].”\n    In 2013, AB DE was under investigation by military authorities for mari-\njuana distribution and steroid use. Appellant was also under investigation at\nthe time. AB DE and Appellant discussed their investigations. AB DE was\nultimately convicted at a court-martial for marijuana distribution and steroid\nuse. During the investigation into his offenses, AB DE lied under oath to in-\nvestigators. His sentence included 32 months of confinement and a bad-\nconduct discharge. AB DE and Appellant were reunited in the Minot AFB\nconfinement facility, where AB DE starting serving his post-trial confinement\non 13 February 2014 and Appellant was ordered into pretrial confinement.\nWhile in confinement, the two talked about their cases daily.\n    The Government requested and obtained records of AB DE’s 2012 arrest\nfor shoplifting and providing false information prior to Appellant’s trial de-\nfense counsel’s specific requests for such information. However, the Govern-\nment failed to provide this previously-obtained material to the Defense in re-\nsponse to their request.\n    Appellant argues that the trial counsel’s failure to disclose this infor-\nmation about AB DE’s arrest for false information resulted in an unfair trial\n“because it would have significantly strengthened the defense’s argument\nthat [AB] DE lied to advance his own interests; DE not only lied to Air Force\nAuthorities on one occasion, he lied to civilian law enforcement on [a] sepa-\nrate occasion and thus could be said to routinely lie.”\n\n\n9   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431.\n\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    Trial counsel’s failure to disclose evidence that is favorable to the defense\non the issue of guilt or sentencing violates an accused’s right to due process.\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). “A military accused also has the\nright to obtain favorable evidence under Article 46, UCMJ . . . as implement-\ned by [R.C.M.] 701–703.” United States v. Coleman, 72 M.J. 184, 186–87\n(C.A.A.F. 2013). Accordingly, Article 46 and these implementing rules pro-\nvide a military accused statutory discovery rights that are greater than those\nafforded by the Constitution. See id. at 187; United States v. Roberts, 59 M.J.\n323, 327 (C.A.A.F. 2004).\n    Consequently, there are two categories of disclosure error: (1) cases in\nwhich the defense made no discovery request or merely a general request for\ndiscovery, and (2) cases in which the defense specifically requested the infor-\nmation. Coleman, 72 M.J. at 187 (citing Roberts, 59 M.J. at 326–27). The\nharmless error standard of review—“whether there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different”—applies to the first category. Id. (quoting Smith v. Cain,\n565 U.S. 73, 75 (2012)). The heightened constitutional harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt standard applies to the second category. Id. “Failing to dis-\nclose requested material favorable to the defense is not harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt if the undisclosed evidence might have affected the outcome\nof the trial.” Id.\n    In reviewing discovery matters, we conduct the following two-step analy-\nsis: “first, we determine whether the information or evidence at issue was\nsubject to disclosure or discovery; second, if there was nondisclosure of such\ninformation, we test the effect of that nondisclosure on [Appellant’s] trial.” Id.\n(quoting Roberts, 59 M.J. at 325).\n    Using this analytical framework, we first quickly conclude—and the Gov-\nernment concedes—that the material pertaining to AB DE’s 2012 arrest for\nshoplifting and false information was not only subject to disclosure by the\nGovernment, but that the Government was indeed obligated to provide such\ninformation to the Defense.\n    In testing the effect of this nondisclosure on Appellant’s trial, we apply\nthe harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard. AB DE provided testimony\nregarding several of the charged offenses; however, most of his testimony was\ncorroborated by other evidence, to include Appellant’s statements. On direct\nexamination, AB DE described some of his own misconduct, including buying\ndrugs from Appellant’s roommate, and he explained how he was convicted by\na court-martial for distribution of marijuana and steroid use and consequent-\nly sentenced to confinement. AB DE’s cross-examination by Appellant’s civil-\nian defense counsel began as follows:\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\f                      United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. [AB DE], what were you actually convicted of in your court-\n       martial?\n       A. Distribution of marijuana and use of steroids.\n       Q. What were you sentenced to?\n       A. Thirty-two months.\n       Q. How much time do you have left at this point?\n       A. A little over a year.\n       Q. When was your action taken, do you know?\n       A. When was I sentenced?\n       Q. No, when did the general sign off on your conviction?\n       A. I don’t know.\n       Q. You don’t know that?\n       A. No, sir.\n       Q. And you were given what type of a discharge?\n       A. A BCD.\n       Q. A BCD?\n       A. Yes, sir.\nThe cross-examination also notably included the following:\n       Q. Now, when were there discussions between you and [ET] 10\n       about the fact that information from [Appellant] could be help-\n       ful to people in confinement? When was that discussion?\n       A. What do you mean?\n       Q. There was discussion between [ET] and other people to the\n       effect that [Appellant] was basically a Captain facing charges,\n       and information about him could help people that were in a\n       post-trial or pretrial confinement situation, was there not?\n       A. Yes.\n       ....\n\n\n\n10 ET was another Airman confined with Appellant during Appellant’s pretrial con-\nfinement at Minot AFB.\n\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n      Q. What was that conversation about?\n      A. Just the fact that it had to do with helping us out for doing\n      the right thing.\n      Q. And helping us out, meaning the other people, other than\n      the accused, correct?\n      A. Right.\n      Q. By getting all their sentences reduced, correct?\n      A. Correct.\n      ....\n      Q. Once the knowledge came out amongst you and the other\n      people that the monitoring devices were there were there dis-\n      cussions about trying to get the accused to talk about what he\n      was in there for?\n      A. Not that I know of.\n      Q. You did not have that conversation with [ET]?\n      A. Not that I know of, not that I can remember.\n      Q. Not that you can remember; did you hear the other people\n      that were in confinement with you talking about that?\n      A. The only thing they talked about was the fact they were go-\n      ing to try to get less time for what he had told them.\nAB DE’s cross-examination concluded as follows:\n      Q. When you came into the Air Force, as you have indicated,\n      you had never used drugs before, correct?\n      A. Yes, sir.\n      ....\n      Q. And then you get involved with drugs, using and possessing,\n      and distributing drugs, correct?\n      A. Yes, sir.\n      Q. Extensively involved, correct?\n      A. Not extensively.\n      Q. Well involved enough that you went to a court-martial over\n      it, correct?\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n                                      26\n\f                      United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. What was the amount of marijuana you had?\n       A. Thirteen point eight ounces.\n       Q. What is the street value of that?\n       A. Five thousand dollars.\n       Q. Five thousand dollars?\n       A. Somewhere around there.\n       Q. Okay, so you were somewhat involved in marijuana?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. Correct; and then when you were contacted by OSI, you\n       were questioned and you flat-out lied to OSI, correct?\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. And you knew you were under oath, correct?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. And the reason you lied was because you thought it was to\n       your advantage to do so, correct?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. And you lied with the specific intention to deceive the people\n       that you were talking to, correct?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       CDC: Nothing further. Thank you.\n    There was no redirect examination and the prosecution rested immediate-\nly after AB DE was excused.\n    At trial, AB DE’s credibility was directly challenged and his motives to\nfabricate revealed. AB DE was shown to be a convicted drug distributor, con-\nvicted drug user, and admitted self-serving liar. AB DE also acknowledged\nthe potential for receiving some form of “help” in exchange for providing in-\ncriminating information against Appellant. These matters impacting AB DE’s\ncredibility would have been self-evident to the military judge. Accordingly, we\nhave no doubt that confronting AB DE with his lie to police about being 18\nrather than 20 years old immediately after his arrest for shoplifting at\nWalmart over two years prior to Appellant’s trial would not have affected the\noutcome of Appellant’s case. While the conduct of the prosecution in not dis-\nclosing the 2012 arrest material “was, at a minimum, negligent, and certainly\nviolated Brady, Article 46, and R.C.M. 701–703, the Government has estab-\n\n\n\n                                       27\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nlished that under the circumstances of this case its failure was harmless be-\nyond a reasonable doubt.” Coleman, 72 M.J. at 189.\nC. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 11\n    In general, Appellant alleges his civilian and military trial defense coun-\nsel (1) “failed to adequately challenge the testimony of key witnesses despite\npossessing evidence that these witnesses previously made contradictory\nstatements—some of which were sworn”; (2) “failed to object to material evi-\ndence offered by the Government, or move to include exculpatory evidence”;\nand (3) “failed to properly investigate the case and compile favorable evidence\nthat was easily accessible through [the Freedom of Information Act].” Appel-\nlant consequently concludes “[d]efense counsel’s performance was deficient\nand significantly prejudiced Appellant.” 12\n    In support of his complaints against his trial defense counsel, Appellant\nsubmitted several declarations and documents for our consideration. Accord-\ningly, we ordered and received declarations from his trial defense counsel in\nresponse.\n    The Sixth Amendment guarantees Appellant the right to effective assis-\ntance of counsel. United States v. Gilley, 56 M.J. 113, 124 (C.A.A.F. 2001). In\nassessing the effectiveness of counsel we apply the standard set forth in\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), and begin with the pre-\nsumption of competence announced in United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648,\n658 (1984). See Gilley, 56 M.J. at 124 (citing United States v. Grigoruk, 52\nM.J. 312, 315 (C.A.A.F. 2000)).\n    Accordingly, as a general matter we “will not second-guess the strategic or\ntactical decisions made at trial by defense counsel.” United States v. Mazza,\n67 M.J. 470, 475 (C.A.A.F. 2009). When Appellant “attacks the trial strategy\nor tactics of the defense counsel, [he] must show specific defects in counsel’s\nperformance that were ‘unreasonable under prevailing professional norms.’”\nId. (quoting United States v. Perez, 64 M.J. 239, 243 (C.A.A.F. 2006)). We re-\nview allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo. United States v.\nGooch, 69 M.J. 353, 362 (C.A.A.F. 2011) (citing Mazza, 67 M.J. at 474).\n\n\n11   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431.\n12In addition to the specific claims addressed in this opinion, we considered all other\nineffective assistance of counsel issues raised by Appellant in his declarations and\nbriefs pursuant to Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431. We reject those remaining issues as they\nrequire no additional analysis nor warrant relief. See United States v. Matias, 25\nM.J. 356, 363 (C.M.A. 1987).\n\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n   We utilize the following three-part test to determine whether the pre-\nsumption of competence has been overcome:\n       1. Are appellant’s allegations true; if so, “is there a reasonable\n       explanation for counsel's actions”?\n       2. If the allegations are true, did defense counsel’s level of ad-\n       vocacy “fall measurably below the performance . . . [ordinarily\n       expected] of fallible lawyers”?\n       3. If defense counsel was ineffective, is there “a reasonable\n       probability that, absent the errors,” there would have been a\n       different result?\nGooch, 69 M.J. at 362 (citing United States v. Polk, 32 M.J. 150, 153 (C.M.A.\n1991)).\n    We review allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo. Id. (cit-\ning Mazza, 67 M.J. at 474).\n   1. Failure to Adequately Confront Witnesses\n    Appellant claims his defense counsel “failed to challenge numerous wit-\nnesses on previous inconsistencies or motive to lie.” Appellant then compiles\na “list of these inconsistencies or motives to lie that were not addressed by\ndefense counsel during cross-examination or elsewhere.” This list includes\nAppellant’s complaints with the testimony of KW, AL, JG, AB DE, and SA\nNP.\n    Appellant argues that “KW was the Government’s first and arguably most\nimportant witness.” Appellant maintains that his civilian defense counsel\nfailed to confront KW with “at least three contradictory, sworn statements to\ninvestigators.” Accordingly, Appellant identifies the following portions of\nKW’s testimony: (1) she “woke up to [Appellant] ejaculating on [her] . . .\nstomach, and there was some inside [her]”; (2) she denied having previously\nexperienced “black-outs”; and (3) she “only saw two exchanges of money be-\ntween the Appellant and other individuals regarding Appellant’s arranging\nfor prostitution.” Appellant contends that his civilian defense counsel should\nhave confronted KW’s testimony on these three points with the following\nstatements KW previously made to investigators: (1) “I don’t remember all\nthat night tell [sic] I woke up to him on top of me cumming inside of me”; (2)\n“I had a lot of mornings where I would wake up half naked and not know\nwhat happened with a random guy next to me . . . . I started having my\nfriends stay the night with me to watch me and they would tell me I disap-\npeared for a while”; and (3) “I had a lot of mornings where I would wake up\nhalf naked and not know what happened with a random guy next to me. I\nwatched most of the guys give [Appellant] money.” Appellant also argues that\n\n\n                                       29\n\f                  United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nhis defense counsel should have elicited testimony from KW regarding KW’s\nstatement that “Appellant got FT pregnant and that [FT] went to Fargo to\nget an abortion” because the Fargo clinic—the only abortion clinic in North\nDakota—“indicated that they did not have any records indicating FT visited\nthe clinic.”\n   While acknowledging that “some of the allegations made by KW did not\nresult in a guilty verdict for certain charged offenses,” Appellant maintains\nKW’s “overall credibility was crucial to the Government’s case.” According to\nAppellant, “[t]he significance of KW’s testimony on the Government’s case is\nevidenced in the closing argument of trial counsel, who referenced KW ap-\nproximately 40 times.” Therefore, Appellant concludes, “had [trial defense\ncounsel] adequately cross-examined KW, the military judge would have given\nher testimony little weight.”\n     In response, Appellant’s trial defense counsel explained that they made\nthe tactical decision not to cross-examine KW with the specific statements\nidentified by Appellant because they wanted to (1) show Appellant did not\npenetrate KW’s vulva; (2) “demonstrate KW was not intoxicated or drugged\nduring the sexual encounter”; and (3) not introduce evidence of “other times\n[KW] saw [Appellant] receive money for having sex with her.” Cross-\nexamining KW with the statements offered by Appellant would have, in trial\ndefense counsel’s estimation, defeated those purposes. With respect to KW’s\nstatement about FT’s abortion, the trial defense counsel assert that KW “did\nnot have any personal knowledge about the purported abortion but had heard\nit from someone else.”\n    Appellant next directs his allegations towards the testimony of AL, during\nwhich she testified to being in a “relationship” with Appellant. Appellant be-\nlieves his trial defense counsel should have confronted AL with a previous\nstatement in which she “denied any romantic or sexual involvement with Ap-\npellant” and evidence suggesting “[Appellant] was dating [AL].”\n    Appellant’s trial defense counsel explained that evidence suggesting Ap-\npellant, a commissioned officer who was then 27 years old, was in a romantic\nrelationship with the 16–17-year-old AL, and seemingly pressuring AL into\nsexual encounters with him in exchange for marijuana, would have been\n“quite devastating” to Appellant’s case.\n    Appellant contends that his trial defense counsel should have cross-\nexamined JG and AB DE about their clemency requests. Consequently, Ap-\npellant maintains “defense counsel never addressed the fact that both JG and\nAB DE had a motive to lie about Appellant: they were seeking clemency from\ntheir respective court-martial sentences.”\n\n\n\n\n                                     30\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    Appellant’s trial defense counsel responded to this assertion as well. Ap-\npellant’s trial defense counsel explained that JG provided favorable evidence\nto the Defense and there was no need to establish any motive for JG to lie.\nDefense counsel further explained that establishing a motive to lie for AB DE\nwould have opened the door for the admission of a prior consistent statement\nthat would have more damning that AB DE’s testimony. Consequently, trial\ndefense counsel decided not to cross-examine these witnesses about their\npost-trial clemency requests.\n    Appellant finally claims that trial defense counsel “actually hurt [his]\ncase during his cross-examination of SA NP by introducing ET’s work as a\nconfidential source after the investigation against Appellant.” (Emphasis in\noriginal). Appellant describes evidence from his Article 32, UCMJ, hearing\nthat indicates ET “worked as a registered OSI source . . . just a short time\nprior to gathering information on Appellant.” Without further explanation,\nAppellant asserts “this was a significant fact that the military judge should\nhave considered, as it calls into question the motive of both ET and the inves-\ntigators, and would likely have led to an analysis of whether the Government\ndeliberately elicited statements from Appellant after his Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel had attached.” Appellant then concludes, again without fur-\nther analysis, that there “is a reasonable probability that this analysis would\nhave limited at least portions of the audio recording from being admitted into\nevidence.”\n    ET did not testify, yet Appellant’s trial defense counsel was able to chal-\nlenge ET’s motives and credibility through SA NP’s cross-examination. Fur-\nthermore, Appellant’s trial defense counsel declared “the confinement record-\nings demonstrate that there was no good faith argument [Appellant] was be-\ning interrogated about charged offenses by an informant after invoking his\nrights to counsel.”\n    Although Appellant identified what he believes to be specific defects in his\ncounsel’s confrontation of certain witnesses, he failed to show that his coun-\nsel’s decisions were unreasonable. Accordingly, we find no reason to second-\nguess the sound decisions Appellant’s counsel made with regard to cross-\nexamining the witnesses identified by Appellant. The trial defense counsel’s\nwell-reasoned and extensive cross-examination of KW resulted in Appellant\nbeing acquitted of several serious offenses—to include the sexual offenses\nagainst KW. Moreover, trial defense counsels’ decision not to confront AL\nabout the nature of Appellant’s “relationship” with AL was reasonably in-\ntended to prevent more evidence about Appellant’s sordid relationships with\nteenage girls from being offered against him. Appellant’s counsel made simi-\nlarly sound decisions in not cross-examining JG and AB DE about their clem-\nency requests; trial defense counsel reasonably sought to avoid impeaching a\n\n\n                                      31\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nfavorable witness and to prevent prior consistent statements from being of-\nfered against Appellant. Likewise, Appellant’s counsel reasonably determined\nthat the timing of ET’s service as an informant did not impact the credibility\nof witnesses nor did it give it rise to a good faith claim that Appellant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel had been violated in any way. Such decisions\nand conclusions, under the facts of this case, can hardly be found to fall\nmeasurably below the performance ordinarily expected of fallible lawyers.\nEven if trial defense counsel’s decisions can be considered ineffective, we find\nno reasonable probability that, had these witnesses been confronted as pro-\nposed by Appellant, there would have been a different, more favorable result\nfor Appellant at trial. Appellant failed to establish his counsel were ineffec-\ntive in confronting KW, AL, JG, AB DE, and SA NP.\n   2. Failure to Object or Offer Exculpatory Evidence\n    Appellant also alleges that his counsel “were deficient in their handling of\nkey exhibits.” To support this allegation, Appellant argues that his counsel’s\n“loss of [a disk containing hundreds of pictures and texts between AL and\nAppellant] and subsequent failure to require the text messages be admitted\nin their entirety prevented the military judge from accurately assessing AL’s\ncredibility.”\n    In response to this allegation, Appellant’s counsel both maintained that\nthe disk was thoroughly reviewed and the evidence never “lost” as a copy\ncould be obtained from the Government. Moreover, Appellant’s counsel\nagreed that offering the text messages in their entirety would, apart from po-\ntentially showing Appellant and AL were in more than a “relationship” as AL\ntestified, and would “not paint [Appellant] in a positive light.” According to\nAppellant’s counsel, these text messages would once again show Appellant, a\n27-year-old commissioned officer, in relationship with a 16–17-year-old girl—\na relationship in which he discussed giving her drugs seemingly in exchange\nfor romantic encounters. The trial defense counsel explained that they “had\nthe disc when AL testified but made a strategic decision not to use it because\nthe texts were so harmful to [Appellant].”\n   Appellant further alleges that “[d]efense counsel similarly failed to re-\nquire the audio recordings from the confinement facility be admitted in their\nentirety.” Appellant surmises,\n       Had they done so, the military judge would have been able to\n       see how much the other inmates prodded Appellant for infor-\n       mation. She also would have been able to compare the Gov-\n       ernment’s cherry-picked statements with the full scope of Ap-\n       pellant’s conversations over a two-week period. Additionally,\n       the military judge would have heard Appellant deny having sex\n\n\n                                       32\n\f                    United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       with GB, deny knowing FT’s age, and been able to generally\n       gauge how much exaggeration and bravado inmates engaged in\n       while confined.\n    Appellant’s counsel describe the confinement recordings as “[o]ne of the\nmost significant problems [they] faced in the case.” Appellant explained to his\ncounsel that he engaged in these discussions because “he was trying to im-\npress the junior enlisted personnel he was confined with.” Both trial defense\ncounsel concluded the recordings were extremely prejudicial to Appellant—\nfor example, Appellant initiated conversations about his misconduct; detailed\nhis own criminal misconduct; “utilized gang and racial terminology”; used in-\nappropriate language with junior enlisted personnel; “name-called” his lead-\nership and the legal office; referred to witnesses as “b[****]es”; stated his first\nsergeant was a “d[***]head who didn’t do s[**]t for him”; talked “about want-\ning to become an attorney so he could represent organized crime an[d] make a\nlot of money”; and “discussed prior allegations for which he received non-\njudicial punishment for which the Government never found all of the evi-\ndence against him.” According to Appellant’s counsel, the aforementioned ex-\namples are “just a sample of the hours of similar conversations.” Consequent-\nly, trial defense counsel merely wanted to provide context to the limited con-\nversations offered by the Government. Trial defense counsel explained that\nthey wanted to show that Appellant’s statements in the Government’s exhibit\n“were just bravado and not true admissions of guilt.” Trial defense counsel\nfurther explained their decision not to play any more of the confinement re-\ncordings “as a strategic decision based on what [they] believe was in [Appel-\nlant’s] best interest.”\n    Finally, Appellant claims that his trial defense counsel were deficient in\nrequesting the military judge take judicial notice of the distance between\nFargo, North Dakota, and Minot, North Dakota, rather than Fargo and\nBerthold, North Dakota, which Appellant states is 24 miles farther west. Ap-\npellant concludes that his counsel “should have recognized the difference . . .\nand understood that driving farther from Fargo would provide a better alibi”\nto the unlawful entry offense.\n   In response to this claim, Appellant’s counsel agreed that they did request\nthe military judge take judicial notice of the 300.23 miles. However, Appel-\nlant’s military defense counsel asserted that Berthold was actually closer and\nmade Appellant’s alibi defense more plausible.\n    We disagree with Appellant and find that his counsel’s decisions not to of-\nfer the entirety of Appellant’s text messages with AL and the entirety of his\nrecorded conversations with enlisted inmates to be more than reasonable giv-\nen the content of those communications and the general context of Appel-\nlant’s case. Once again, Appellant’s counsel reasonably concluded that evi-\n\n                                        33\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\ndence revealing the nature of Appellant’s relationship with a teenaged girl—\nthat ostensibly included sexual innuendo and drugs—would have damaged,\nrather than helped, their case. Appellant’s counsel likewise soundly assessed\nthe objectively negative impact recordings that captured Appellant, inter alia,\nbragging about his crimes, glorifying a criminal lifestyle, degrading superiors\nand others, and using racially offensive language would have had on Appel-\nlant’s defense. Furthermore, we find that Appellant’s counsel’s request for the\nmilitary judge to take judicial notice of the distance between Fargo and Minot\nwas reasonable. Accordingly, Appellant failed to show that these strategic\nevidentiary decisions fell measurably below the performance ordinarily ex-\npected of fallible lawyers. Even if trial defense counsel’s decisions can be con-\nsidered ineffective, we find no reasonable probability that had the evidence\nchampioned by Appellant been admitted there would have been a different,\nlet alone a more favorable, result for Appellant at trial. Appellant failed to\nestablish his counsel were ineffective in handling these evidentiary matters.\n   3. Failure to Properly Investigate\n    Lastly, Appellant alleges that his “[d]efense counsel was deficient in com-\npiling favorable evidence for Appellant.” Appellant argues that he, “a legal\nlayman, was able to obtain . . . materials through his own initiative and while\nconfined.” Appellant lists the “several materials that would have helped Ap-\npellant,” as follows:\n       a. A sexual assault allegation against AC. Included in the file is\n       a transcript of a conversation between Detective MM and KW,\n       regarding the allegation that AC had sex with KW, then a mi-\n       nor. During this conversation, KW denied remembering having\n       sex with AC, her then-fiancé. She later confessed to having sex\n       with him one to five times.\n       b. Affidavit from TC, a Minot Police officer, describing AL’s ar-\n       rest for marijuana on 24 May 2014. After AL’s arrest, she was\n       taken to the Ward County jail where she denied having any-\n       thing on her person; however, a Corrections Officer found a\n       glass smoking device with burnt marijuana and a baggie of ma-\n       rijuana in her bra.\n       c. Affidavit of Probable Cause relating to the shoplifting arrest\n       of DE on 7 May 2012. During this arrest, DE lied to law en-\n       forcement about his age. The case was later transferred to the\n       Air Force.\n       d. Administrative segregation documents, dated 25 June 2014.\n       [Staff Sergeant (SSgt)] JO testified that Appellant entered seg-\n       regation on 20 June 2014 and was only there for “two, maybe\n\n\n                                       34\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       three weeks.” [The documents show] that Appellant’s segrega-\n       tion began on 6 June 2014 and ended on 20 August 2014; a to-\n       tal of 75 days.\n       e. KW’s Facebook post on 3 June 2013, calling Appellant an\n       “amazing roommate” who knows “how to treat a ladie.” [sic]\n       f. Photos of Appellant’s apartment taken by the Minot Police\n       Department.\n(Citations omitted).\n      Appellant then argues that the “records of AC’s sexual assault allegation\n. . . and KW’s Facebook posts would have challenged KW’s credibility.” He\nmaintains that KW lied to law enforcement. Appellant also posits that KW’s\nFacebook posts “contradict[] her testimony that Appellant sexually assaulted\nher,” and when she “moved out” of Appellant’s apartment. Appellant contin-\nues to support his allegations with the following arguments:\n       TC’s affidavit would have challenged AL’s credibility; she lied\n       to [law] enforcement.\n       DE’s shoplifting record would have challenged his credibility;\n       he lied to law enforcement.\n       ....\n       The administrative segregation documents contradict SSgt\n       JO’s testimony and a memorandum he wrote detailing when\n       Appellant entered segregation. The military judge relied on\n       these dates for her ruling regarding illegal pretrial punish-\n       ment.\n       ....\n       The photos of Appellant’s apartment taken by the Minot Police\n       Department show the bed in the far corner of his room. This\n       would have made it virtually impossible for KW to have wit-\n       nessed Appellant having sex with GB from the door and in the\n       dark.\n(Citations omitted).\n    Appellant’s counsel described their pretrial preparation and related inves-\ntigation. Appellant’s counsel explained their multiple discovery requests with\nthe Government and conducting their own investigation of potential Govern-\nment witnesses—including searches of court records and social media. How-\never, Appellant’s counsel did not discover or obtain the material listed by Ap-\npellant.\n\n\n\n                                      35\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    In response to some of Appellant’s specific claims, his counsel maintain\nthat, even if they had the information cited by Appellant, they would not\nhave cross-examined KW about her sexual assault allegations against AC be-\ncause “AC was an associate of [Appellant] and discussed during the trial as\nsomeone who was part of several of the charged events and this records [sic]\nshows him having sex with underage girls, in which part of the charges\nagainst [Appellant] alleged his so-called gang was involved.” Appellant’s\ncounsel also state that they also would not have cross-examined AL about her\nmarijuana arrest because “it demonstrated that AL was using marijuana,\nwhich the Government’s evidence demonstrated was coming from [Appel-\nlant].” According to Appellant’s counsel, KW’s Facebook post apparently\n“came from [Appellant’s] Facebook page” and Appellant’s counsel asked Ap-\npellant’s family members for assistance in obtaining information from Appel-\nlant’s Facebook page.\n    Appellant’s successful efforts in obtaining information about a few wit-\nnesses and other material—even while conducted from confinement—do not,\nper se, render his counsel ineffective for failing to obtain the same infor-\nmation during their pretrial investigation. Indeed, Appellant’s trial defense\ncounsel had “a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasona-\nble decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 691. “In considering whether an investigation was thorough, ‘[w]e\naddress not what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is constitutionally\ncompelled.’” United States v. Akbar, 74 M.J. 364, 379–80 (C.A.A.F. 2015)\n(quoting Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 794 (1987)). Accordingly, we find that\ntrial defense counsel took reasonable efforts to investigate and obtain,\nthrough discovery, favorable information in Appellant’s case. Their pretrial\nconduct did not fall measurably below the performance ordinarily expected of\nfallible lawyers.\n    Even if Appellant’s trial defense counsel were ineffective in uncovering\nthe information obtained by Appellant, we find no reasonable probability that\nthere would have been a different result. First, Appellant was acquitted of\nthe sexual offenses against KW. Second, AC was not a witness at trial and his\ncounsel reasonably would not have cross-examined KW about potential, simi-\nlar sexual offenses perpetrated by Appellant’s associate. Third, AL’s credibil-\nity was thoroughly examined by trial defense counsel. Additional, less-\ndamaging impeachment would not have changed the outcome of Appellant’s\ncase and Appellant has failed to show as much. The information pertaining to\nAB DE should have be disclosed by the Government, as previously discussed;\nhowever, this additional impeachment evidence would not have made a dif-\nferent result reasonably probable. In addition, Appellant testified about the\ndates he was arguably segregated during pretrial confinement. Therefore, the\nmilitary judge was able to consider this information in deciding Appellant’s\n\n                                      36\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\npretrial punishment claims; we find no reasonable probability the “adminis-\ntrative segregation documents” would have changed the military judge’s rul-\ning. Finally, the photographs of Appellant’s room arguably corroborated por-\ntions of KW’s testimony and do not create a reasonable probability of a differ-\nent outcome in Appellant’s trial.\n    Appellant’s trial defense counsel were not ineffective in their efforts to\nuncover favorable information for Appellant. However, assuming Appellant’s\ntrial defense counsel were ineffective, we further find no reasonable probabil-\nity that, even with the information obtained by Appellant, there would have\nbeen a different result.\nD. Pretrial Punishment\n   Appellant was ordered into pretrial confinement at Minot AFB, North\nDakota. During an “inspection” of the facility’s common sleeping area, mili-\ntary confinement officials, for no articulated reason, ransacked that portion of\nthe facility—throwing and littering the confinees’ items throughout the room.\nAt one point, a noncommissioned officer ripped the Velcro rank off of Appel-\nlant’s parka and threw it across the room. The conduct of these officials was\ncaptured on video.\n    At trial, Appellant claimed he suffered pretrial punishment and requested\nappropriate sentence relief. After receiving evidence, to include the video re-\ncordings of the “inspection,” the military judge determined Appellant was en-\ntitled to sentencing relief for the unreasonable delays in receiving his mail he\nexperienced while in pretrial confinement. Pertinently, the military judge de-\nclined to provide Appellant relief for the conditions of the “inspection,” find-\ning, as fact, the following:\n       One guard ripped rank off a parka at that time, and threw it,\n       but not away. No evidence provides context for why the guard\n       did that, or why they threw things around during the search.\n       The accused’s things were treated the same or better than the\n       other confine[e]s. I do not impute intent to punish based on\n       that search.\n       ....\n       The accused discussed with [DE] that [he] would try to escape\n       if he got more than six months’ confinement. That might sug-\n       gest that the only escape danger was after court-martial and\n       not before. However, it was reasonable to enforce rules aimed\n       at preventing escape throughout the period of confinement.\n   On appeal, Appellant maintains that the confinement officials’ conduct\nduring the inspection served no legitimate purpose and was punitive in na-\n\n\n                                      37\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nture. Appellant again asserts he was subjected to illegal pretrial punishment,\nentitling him to “appropriate sentence relief.”\n    Appellant bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to additional\nsentence credit due to illegal pretrial punishment under Article 13, UCMJ.\nUnited States v. Mosby, 56 M.J. 309, 310 (C.A.A.F. 2002).\n   Article 13, UCMJ, provides:\n       No person, while being held for trial, may be subjected to pun-\n       ishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the\n       charges pending against him, nor shall the arrest or confine-\n       ment imposed upon him be any more rigorous than the circum-\n       stances required to insure his presence, but he may be subject-\n       ed to minor punishment during that period for infractions of\n       discipline.\n10 U.S.C. § 813.\n    The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) out-\nlined the contours of Article 13, UCMJ, as follows:\n       Article 13, UCMJ, prohibits two things: (1) the imposition of\n       punishment prior to trial, and (2) conditions of arrest or pretri-\n       al confinement that are more rigorous than necessary to ensure\n       the accused’s presence for trial. The first prohibition of Article\n       13 involves a purpose or intent to punish, determined by exam-\n       ining the intent of detention officials or by examining the pur-\n       poses served by the restriction or condition, and whether such\n       purposes are “reasonably related to a legitimate governmental\n       objective.” Bell [v. Wolfish], 441 U.S. [520,] 539 . . . [(1979)];\n       [United States v.] McCarthy, 47 M.J. [162,] 165, 167 [(C.A.A.F.\n       1997)].\n       The second prohibition of Article 13 prevents imposing unduly\n       rigorous circumstances during pretrial detention. Conditions\n       that are sufficiently egregious may give rise to a permissive in-\n       ference that an accused is being punished, or the conditions\n       may be so excessive as to constitute punishment. McCarthy, 47\n       M.J. at 165; United States v. James, 28 M.J. 214, 216 (C.M.A.\n       1989) (conditions that are “arbitrary or purposeless” can be\n       considered to raise an inference of punishment).\nUnited States v. King, 61 M.J. 225, 227–28 (C.A.A.F. 2005); see United States\nv. Zarbatany, 70 M.J. 169, 174 (C.A.A.F. 2011).\n   The primary mechanism for addressing violations of Article 13, UCMJ, is\nconfinement credit. Zarbatany, 70 M.J. at 174.\n\n                                      38\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    “The question whether appellant is entitled to credit for a violation of Ar-\nticle 13 is a mixed question of fact and law.” Mosby, 56 M.J. at 310. A military\njudge’s findings of fact, to include a finding of no intent to punish, will not be\noverturned unless those findings are clearly erroneous. Id. “We will review de\nnovo the ultimate question whether [Appellant] is entitled to credit for a vio-\nlation of Article 13.” Id.\n    The military judge’s findings of facts are supported by the record and are\nnot clearly erroneous; however, we reach a different answer to the ultimate\nquestion of whether Appellant is entitled to credit for a violation of Article 13.\nIn her analysis, the military judge found “that there was no purpose or intent\nby any governmental authority to punish the accused.” After finding unrea-\nsonable, excessive delay in screening Appellant’s mail, the military judge\nconcluded, “All other actions were reasonably related to a legitimate govern-\nment objective.” But even if this was so—and even absent an intent to pun-\nish—the military judge failed to properly consider whether the inspection\nwas sufficiently egregious as to violate Article 13’s second prohibition. Alt-\nhough the search or inspection of the confinement sleeping area may have\nbeen reasonably related to a legitimate government objective, the military\nmembers’ behavior in conducting the search was—like the screening of Ap-\npellant’s mail—excessive. The video recording of the search displays a de-\nplorable disregard of any professional expectation or standard. The noncom-\nmissioned officers conducting the search wantonly, and with apparent\namusement, ransacked the area, throwing confinees’ personal items across\nthe room and on the floor, flipping bed frames, and tearing the rank off of\nAppellant’s parka. Appellant’s items were treated with the same disregard as\nthe other confinees. The fact that Appellant was subjected to the same egre-\ngious condition as others does not eliminate the excessive nature of the condi-\ntion. The conditions of this “search” were so excessive as to constitute pun-\nishment. Therefore, we find Appellant is entitled to some relief. After consid-\nering the nature of the Article 13 violation, to include its relatively short du-\nration, we grant Appellant one week of additional confinement credit.\nE. Post-trial and Appellate Delay\n    The convening authority took action on Appellant’s case 228 days after\nAppellant’s court-martial due to administrative and processing delays. Appel-\nlant’s record of trial was docketed with this court on 11 August 2015. Appel-\nlant’s civilian appellate defense counsel requested nine 30-day enlargements\nof time to file assignments of error. Each of these requests was granted in\nwhole, except for the ninth, which was granted in part.\n   Convicted Airmen have a due process right to timely review and appeal of\ncourts-martial convictions. United States v. Moreno, 63 M.J. 129, 135\n(C.A.A.F. 2006). In Moreno, the CAAF established a presumption of unrea-\n\n                                       39\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nsonable post-trial delay that requires a due process review when the conven-\ning authority does not take action within 120 days of trial, when a record of\ntrial is not docketed with us within 30 days of the convening authority’s ac-\ntion, and when we do not render a decision within 18 months of the case’s\ndocketing. Id. at 142.\n    Accordingly, if there is a Moreno-based presumption of unreasonable de-\nlay or an otherwise facially-unreasonable delay, we are required to conduct a\nde novo review of Appellant’s case to determine whether his due process right\nto a speedy post-trial review and appeal has been violated. Id. at 135. To re-\nsolve this question, we examine the four factors set forth in Barker v. Wingo,\n407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972): “(1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the\ndelay; (3) the appellant’s assertion of the right to timely review and appeal;\nand (4) prejudice.” Moreno, 63 M.J. at 135. Moreno identified three types of\nprejudice arising from post-trial processing delay: (1) oppressive incarcera-\ntion; (2) anxiety and concern; and (3) impairment of ability to present a de-\nfense at a rehearing. Id. at 138–39 (citations omitted).\n    “We analyze each factor and make a determination as to whether that\nfactor favors the Government or the appellant.” Id. at 136. Then, we balance\nour analysis of the factors to determine whether a due process violation oc-\ncurred. Id. (citing Barker, 407 U.S. at 533) (“Courts must still engage in a dif-\nficult and sensitive balancing process.”). “No single factor is required for find-\ning a due process violation and the absence of a given factor will not prevent\nsuch a finding.” Id. However, where an appellant has not shown prejudice\nfrom the delay, there is no due process violation unless the delay is so egre-\ngious as to “adversely affect the public’s perception of the fairness and integ-\nrity of the military justice system.” United States v. Toohey, 63 M.J. 353, 362\n(C.A.A.F. 2006).\n    Although Appellant experienced at least two periods of presumptively un-\nreasonable delay in the post-trial processing and review of his case, he has\nnot claimed any legally cognizable prejudice from the delays, and we find\nnone. Appellant also does not assert that his due process right to timely re-\nview and appeal had been violated. After conducting our analysis and balanc-\ning of the Barker factors, even considering the length and reasons for the de-\nlays, we do not find the delays so egregious that tolerating them would ad-\nversely affect the public’s perception of the fairness and integrity of the mili-\ntary justice system. See id. Therefore, we find no due process violation. How-\never, such a finding does not end our review of this matter.\n   Indeed, Appellant argues that he is entitled to “meaningful relief” in the\nform of “day-for-day credit for each day over the 120[-day Moreno] metric” in\naccordance with United States v. Tardif, 57 M.J. 219 (C.A.A.F. 2002), rather\nthan a due process claim under Moreno. Tardif permits us to consider wheth-\n\n                                       40\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\ner we should exercise our power under Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n866(c), to grant relief for excessive post-trial delay. 57 M.J. at 224. In resolv-\ning Appellant’s request for Tardif relief, we are guided by factors enumerated\nin United States v. Gay, 74 M.J. 736, 744 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2015), aff’d, 75\nM.J. 264 (C.A.A.F. 2016), with no single factor being dispositive. 13\n    The lengthy post-trial administrative delay between Appellant’s case and\naction is indefensible. See United States v. Dunbar, 31 M.J. 70, 73 (C.M.A.\n1990). However, after balancing the remaining factors, to include our consid-\neration of the delay attributed to Appellant’s civilian appellate counsel, we\nconclude no extraordinary exercise of our Article 66(c) authority is warranted\nhere. Considered as a whole, Appellant’s case has not been subjected to ex-\ncessive delay, and we discern no particular harm to Appellant. The delays\nhave not lessened the disciplinary effect of Appellant’s sentence. The delays\nhave not adversely affected our ability to review Appellant’s case or grant\nhim relief, if warranted. The circumstances of Appellant’s case do not move\nus to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence imposed by the military judge\nand approved by the convening authority.\nF. Sentence Reassessment\n    Having found Appellant’s conviction of unlawful entry factually insuffi-\ncient, we have to consider whether we can reassess his sentence or whether a\nsentence rehearing is required.\n   Indeed, we have “broad discretion” when reassessing sentences. United\nStates v. Winckelmann, 73 M.J. 11, 12 (C.A.A.F. 2013). The CAAF has re-\npeatedly held that if we “can determine to [our] satisfaction that, absent any\nerror, the sentence adjudged would have been of at least a certain severity,\nthen a sentence of that severity or less will be free of the prejudicial effects of\nerror . . . .” United States v. Sales, 22 M.J. 305, 308 (C.M.A. 1986). Thus, our\n\n\n13 These factors include: (1) How long the delay exceeded the standards set forth in\nMoreno; (2) what reasons, if any, the Government set forth for the delay, and wheth-\ner there is any evidence of bad faith or gross indifference to the overall post-trial pro-\ncessing of this case; (3) keeping in mind that our goal under Tardif is not to analyze\nfor prejudice, whether there is nonetheless some evidence of harm (either to the ap-\npellant or institutionally) caused by the delay; (4) whether the delay has lessened the\ndisciplinary effect of any particular aspect of the sentence, and whether relief is con-\nsistent with the dual goals of justice and good order and discipline; (5) whether there\nis any evidence of institutional neglect concerning timely post-trial processing, either\nacross the service or at a particular installation; and (6) given the passage of time,\nwhether this court can provide meaningful relief in this particular situation. Gay, 74\nM.J. at 744.\n\n\n\n\n                                           41\n\f                  United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nanalysis is based on a totality of the circumstances with consideration of the\nfollowing factors: dramatic changes in the penalty landscape and exposure;\nthe forum; whether the remaining offenses capture the gravamen of the crim-\ninal conduct; whether significant or aggravating circumstances remain ad-\nmissible and relevant; and whether the remaining offenses are the type that\nwe as appellate judges have experience and familiarity with to reliably de-\ntermine what sentence would have been imposed at trial. Winckelmann, 73\nM.J. at 15–16.\n    Our decision to dismiss Appellant’s unlawful entry conviction only chang-\nes the punitive landscape of this case by six months of confinement. The re-\nmaining sexual, drug, and gang-related offenses capture the gravamen of Ap-\npellant’s criminal conduct. Moreover, the forum was military judge alone and\nwe are “more likely to be certain of what a military judge would have done.”\nId. at 16. Given our experience and familiarity with sentences appropriate for\nAppellant’s convictions, we are confident that absent any error, the military\njudge would have sentenced Appellant to at least a dismissal, confinement for\n24 years and 9 months, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. Accordingly,\na sentence rehearing in not required.\n\n                              III. CONCLUSION\n     The finding of guilt to Specification 4 of Charge VII is SET ASIDE and\nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The remaining findings and sentence, as\nreassessed, are correct in law and fact, and are AFFIRMED. Article 66(c),\nUCMJ. Appellant is credited with one week (seven days) of confinement cred-\nit for pretrial punishment suffered in violation of Article 13, UCMJ.\n\n\n                FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                KURT J.

The military\n\n\n\n1 The military judge found Appellant not guilty pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial\n(R.C.M.) 917 of raping GB in violation of Article 120b,UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 920b, but\nconvicted Appellant of the lesser-included offense of sexual assault, also in violation\nof Article 120b, UCMJ.\n2 The military judge found Appellant not guilty pursuant to R.C.M. 917 of raping FT\nin violation of Article 120b, UCMJ, but convicted Appellant of the lesser-included of-\nfense of sexual assault, also in violation of Article 120b, UCMJ.\n3 The military judge acquitted Appellant of conspiracy to pander; distribution of\nmethamphetamine; distribution of heroin; distribution of Vicodin; distribution of ec-\nstasy; distribution of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); sexual assault of KW by ad-\nministering KW a drug or intoxicant; sexual assault of KW by encouraging an un-\nknown individual to commit a sexual act upon KW by administering KW a drug or\nintoxicant; conduct unbecoming an officer for organizing individuals under the age of\n18 years to have sex for hire; obstruction of justice by requesting Airman Basic (AB)\nJS have others give AL marijuana or cash if she refused to testify or “have others\nbeat her up or kill her if she refused the offer”; obstruction of justice by requesting\nAB ET have others give AL marijuana or cash if she refused to testify or “have others\nbeat her up or kill her if she refused the offer”; and communicating a threat to hurt,\ninjure, or kill AB JS. The military judge granted the Defense’s motion for a finding of\nnot guilty pursuant to R.C.M. 917 and found Appellant not guilty of raping FT. Ap-\npellant was also found guilty by several exceptions and substitutions.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\njudge credited Appellant with 60 days of pretrial confinement credit. The\nconvening authority approved the adjudged sentence.\n    On appeal, Appellant argues that all of his convictions, except his provi-\nsion of alcohol to minors, distribution of marijuana, mushroom use, and\nthreats to AL, are legally and factually insufficient. 4 Appellant also claims\nthe Government failed to meet its discovery obligations; 5 he was deprived his\nconstitutional right to effective assistance of counsel at trial; 6 the military\njudge erred in not granting additional sentencing credit for pretrial punish-\nment Appellant suffered during a search of his pretrial confinement sleeping\nquarters; and post-trial delays in his case warrant meaningful relief.\n    We find there is insufficient evidence to support Appellant’s conviction of\nunlawful entry. We also find that Appellant was subjected to pretrial pun-\nishment in violation of Article 13, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 813, and is, therefore,\nentitled to additional, modest confinement credit. We find no other prejudi-\ncial error, affirm the remaining findings, and reassess the sentence below.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n   Appellant and at least one other local civilian criminal decided to form a\n“Crips” gang in Minot, North Dakota. Appellant—referred to by the gang\nmembers and their associates as “Captain”—became the self-proclaimed\nleader, or “OG,” of this gang, whose criminal enterprise tended to revolve\naround local teenage girls.\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\nA. Legal and Factual Sufficiency\n    Appellant essentially maintains that most of his convictions were ob-\ntained through the testimony of unbelievable witnesses and the judge’s mis-\ninterpretation of the evidence, to include his recorded pretrial confinement\nconversations. However, the law, and indeed the facts of this case, cause us to\ndecline Appellant’s claims and find all but one of his convictions legally and\nfactually sufficient for the reasons discussed below.\n\n\n\n\n4The legal and factual sufficiency of Appellant’s distribution of mushrooms on divers\noccasions is raised pursuant to United States v. Grostefon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.M.A. 1982).\n5   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n6   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    We have a statutory mandate to “conduct a de novo review of both the le-\ngal and factual sufficiency of a conviction.” United States v.

Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 (C.M.A. 1987); see also United\nStates v.

The “reasonable doubt”\nstandard does not require that the evidence be free from conflict. United\nStates v. Lips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 (A.F.C.M.R. 1986). “[I]n resolving questions of\nlegal sufficiency, we are bound to draw every reasonable inference from the\nevidence of record in favor of the prosecution.” United States v.

The question, therefore, is whether “a reason-\nable factfinder reading the evidence one way could have found all the ele-\nments of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Gutierrez,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (C.A.A.F. 2014) (quoting United States v.

In conducting this unique appellate role, we take “a fresh,\nimpartial look at the evidence,” applying “neither a presumption of innocence\nnor a presumption of guilt” to “make [our] own independent determination as\nto whether the evidence constitutes proof of each required element beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” United States v.

Sexual Assault of GB\n   The military judge convicted Appellant of sexual assault of a child for\npenetrating GB’s vulva with his penis when, at the time, GB was only 15\nyears old. Appellant committed this offense during a multi-day party he host-\ned—the “Project X” party. GB went to this party with her teenage friends,\nKW and KH. Another teenage girl, AL, met GB at the party. GB, KH, KW,\nand AL testified at trial.\n   At the time of the party, KW had known Appellant for several months.\nKW testified that at the party she told Appellant GB’s age. KW described\nwalking into Appellant’s bedroom and seeing Appellant having sexual inter-\ncourse with GB. She recounted Appellant and GB being naked with Appel-\nlant on top.\n    GB explained that she met Appellant at this party when she was 15 years\nold. At the party, GB got extremely drunk. She remembered only “flashbacks”\n\n\n                                       4\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nof the evening through the next morning. In pertinent part, GB recounted\nspending time with Appellant in his living room, being on Appellant’s bed\nand picking her bra up off of the bedroom floor, waking up in the morning\nwith her clothes on and nobody else in the bedroom, returning to the down-\nstairs, and “start[ing] the party again.”\n    KH turned 16 years old the same month as the “Project X” party. She too\nfirst met Appellant at the party. KH described “hanging out” and “drinking\nwhen [Appellant] brought the booze home.” KH described GB as “really\ndrunk” and “puking everywhere.” KH observed Appellant and GB together on\na couch, Appellant telling GB she was “really pretty,” Appellant and GB\n“making out,” and the two eventually going upstairs. KH also described see-\ning GB the next morning in Appellant’s bedroom, GB’s clothes on the floor,\nand GB naked except for a bedsheet. Appellant was in the bathroom at the\ntime.\n    AL met Appellant at the “Project X” party. AL described GB as being\n“trashed” the first evening of the party. AL also recounted a conversation she\nhad with Appellant the next day during which Appellant admitted to having\nsex with GB and claimed “he would have got [sic] her pregnant if he hadn’t\ngot [sic] the Plan B pill . . . .” Appellant later became GB’s boyfriend and ex-\nchanged text messages with AL related to his relationship with GB. Appel-\nlant’s text message communications with AL included the following:\n   [Appellant:] Did [GB] tell you I got her prego? Lol\n   [AL:] The night of ur party??\n   [Appellant:] Another time.\n    As Appellant notes on appeal, each of these witnesses was thoroughly\ncross-examined by Appellant’s trial defense counsel. Nonetheless, Appellant\nargues that his conviction of this offense is neither legally nor factually suffi-\ncient because “penetration was not proven,” “KW lacked credibility,” and\n“KH’s testimony is not credible.” The military judge determined otherwise, at\nleast with respect to this offense. Considering the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution and drawing every reasonable inference from the\nevidence in favor of the prosecution, we find a reasonable factfinder could\nhave found all the essential elements of this offense beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Moreover, after weighing the evidence presented at trial regarding\nAppellant’s sexual assault of GB and making allowances for not having ob-\nserved the witnesses who testified as to this offense, we are convinced beyond\na reasonable doubt Appellant sexually assaulted a child, GB, by penetrating\nGB’s vulva with his penis.\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n   2. Sexual Assault of FT\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of sexually assaulting FT, a child\nwho was only 14 years old at the time, by penetrating FT’s vulva with his pe-\nnis, between on or about 1 September 2013 and on or about 30 October 2013.\nFT did not testify at trial. FT’s brother—JP—and KW testified. In addition,\nJG and AB DE testified about incriminating statements and admissions Ap-\npellant made to them while they were confined together during Appellant’s\npretrial confinement at Minot Air Force Base (AFB), North Dakota. Audio\nrecordings of Appellant’s pretrial confinement conversations were also admit-\nted into evidence.\n    JP testified he met Appellant at a party at Appellant’s home approximate-\nly one year after the “Project X” party. While at the party, JP recounted over-\nhearing Appellant tell other partygoers that FT “f[***]s like a boss.” JP told\nAppellant that his sister, FT, was only 14 years old. According to JP, Appel-\nlant was “shocked and appalled” and told JP that “he thought she was 17.”\n    KW introduced FT to Appellant and told Appellant FT’s age—younger\nthan 15 years old at the time. On direct examination, trial counsel asked KW\nif there was “anything physical between [FT] and [Appellant].” KW testified\nthat, near the end of 2013, she walked into Appellant’s bedroom and wit-\nnessed Appellant and FT naked on Appellant’s bed with Appellant on top of\nFT having sex with her.\n    Appellant was in pretrial confinement with JG, a former military member\nwho was then serving post-trial confinement. JG described Appellant’s\nstatements about FT as follows:\n       Q. Did [Appellant] ever talk about an individual named [FT]?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. What did he say about [FT]?\n       A. I guess one night they were throwing a party and [FT] came\n       over. They were drinking and she asked [Appellant] and the\n       other people, the other gang members there, what it takes to\n       get into the gang and they told her that they would have to\n       sleep with her to get into the gang. I guess that [Appellant]\n       said her and three, including him, went up to a bedroom and\n       slept with her. I guess [Appellant] went first followed by [one\n       gang member] and then some other guy who I don’t know the\n       name of.\n       Q. That’s what [Appellant] told you?\n       A. Yes.\n\n\n                                      6\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. Did [Appellant] say how old [FT] was?\n       A. At the time she was 14.\n       Q. Did [Appellant] say specifically what happened that night\n       with [FT]?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Okay, what did he say?\n       A. He said that they had sex, that he went first. [One gang\n       member] went second, and the other guy went third to get her\n       into the gang.\n    AB DE knew Appellant well before they spent time together in confine-\nment. Apart from describing Appellant’s involvement with alcohol, drugs,\nthreats, and GB, AB DE recounted Appellant explaining that KW “would\nbring girls over to have him sleep with,” and “in the military ‘of age’ is 16,\nand he doesn’t ask their age anyway.” AB DE also described comments Appel-\nlant made about FT in pretrial confinement. According to AB DE, the con-\nfinees were listing people they found attractive and FT’s name was listed.\nAppellant stated. “Oh, [FT] that’s the other girl that I got the abortion for.”\nAB DE responded that “She’s got to be like 17 or 18.” AB DE testified that\nAppellant then clarified “No, she was 14 at the time.” AB DE continued to\nrecount Appellant’s discussion of FT that included the following general\nstatements or admissions: FT was drunk the first time Appellant had sex\nwith her; “the first time she was joining the gang so three of the gang mem-\nbers had sex with her; and the second time was when [Appellant] got her\npregnant.” (Emphasis added).\n    The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) placed a recording\ndevice inside the confinement facility to capture Appellant’s conversations\nwith the other confinees. In one recording, the confinees joke about Appel-\nlant’s “Project X” party—“[w]hat do you call a bunch of 15-year-old girls par-\ntying at a house? . . . [Appellant’s] Project X party.” This leads to the follow-\ning exchange, evidently referring to [FT]:\n       [Appellant:] I wasn’t even sure if it was me that got her preg-\n       nant. She got f[****]d by three dudes on the same f[***]in\n       night.\n       [Confinee:] You must feel responsible if you took her to the\n       abortion clinic.\n       [Confinee:] Brown, you promote the degradation of our youth.\n       [Appellant:] I’m doing them a favor.\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       [Confinee:] The f[**]k you are. How are you doing a 14-year-\n       old-girl a favor by knocking her up, feeding her drugs, and then\n       taking her to the Red River abortion clinic?\n       [Confinee:] So, if a 14 year old gets off, if you just happen to be\n       driving by ----\n       [Appellant:] She said she was f[*****]n 17.\nAn excerpt of another recording contained the following statement Appellant\nmade about FT:\n       When I f[*****]d [FT] I really did not know her age. I really\n       thought she was 17, because she f[*****]d like she was older\n       ...\n       She was getting gang f[****]d. She f[****]d me and then after\n       [one gang member] f[****]d her, and then [another] f[****]d\n       her, and then she was like [inaudible].”\n       [Another confinee asks Appellant] And she’s 15?\n       [Appellant responds] Yep.\n    Appellant was originally charged with raping FT, a child, for penetrating\nher vulva with his penis by using force against her, to wit: holding her down\nwith his arms. After the Government rested its findings case, the Defense\nmoved for finding of not guilty of this specification pursuant to Rule for\nCourts-Martial (R.C.M.) 917. Trial defense counsel maintained, “On this\nthere has been [no] evidence whatsoever that Captain Brown used force to\nwit: holding [FT] down with his arms at any point while they were having\nsex.” The Government agreed with the Defense’s assessment, with trial coun-\nsel stating:\n       there was no independent evidence of force because [FT] was\n       not present or testified about that. We do believe there is a\n       lesser included offense. So as to the greater offense of force it is\n       our position that we agree. To the lesser included offense of\n       sexual assault of a child, there is evidence.\nAppellant was convicted of this lesser-included offense.\n    Appellant was originally charged with another specification of raping FT,\na child, which alleged Appellant penetrated FT’s vulva with his penis by ad-\nministering to her a drug, intoxicant or other similar substance. After the\nGovernment rested its findings case, the Defense moved for a finding of not\nguilty of this offense pursuant to R.C.M. 917. Again, the Government agreed\nand the following exchange occurred between the military judge and trial\ncounsel:\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                    United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       STC: And we agree with defense on [the rape by administering\n       a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance specification],\n       that there has not been independent evidence of that specifica-\n       tion as far as [FT]. There was only one incident talked about by\n       multiple witnesses. The audio disagrees, but there is no inde-\n       pendent evidence, so we agree.\n       MJ: And that was to all of the entire specification?\n       STC: To all of [this specification] because I don’t think there is\n       independent evidence of two incidents. There is just one inci-\n       dent.\nAccordingly, the military judge granted the defense motion and found Appel-\nlant not guilty of raping FT by administering her a drug, intoxicant or other\nsimilar substance.\n    Appellant argues that his conviction of sexually assaulting FT is legally\nand factually insufficient because “[t]he only potentially credible evidence\nsupporting this specification came from testimony provided by JP, FT’s\nbrother, and statements purportedly made by [Appellant], admitting to sexu-\nal intercourse with FT.” Appellant also argues that his statements evidenced\nhis “belief that FT was 17 years old, not 14 years old as testified to by her\nbrother.” Accordingly, Appellant maintains, “There was no credible evidence\nthat [Appellant] knew or believed that FT was 14 years old at the time any\nalleged sexual acts may have taken place.” Appellant also claims, “There is\nno evidence corroborating penetration.” Appellant further explains that JP’s\n“story . . . does not make sense,” because “[i]t makes no sense that JP would\nnot confront [Appellant] if this really happened . . . [,] nor did he tell his par-\nents or report it to the police.” Finally, Appellant reasons that “[t]o the extent\nthe government relies on any testimony by KW regarding sexual acts be-\ntween [Appellant] and FT, KW’s credibility has been sufficiently chal-\nlenged . . . .”\n    While we acknowledge the military judge acquitted Appellant of several\ncharges to which KW was the primary—if not the only—witness, we are\nnonetheless mindful that the military judge “may believe one part of a wit-\nness’ testimony and disbelieve another.” United States v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n59 (C.M.A. 1979). Accordingly, Appellant’s view that the military judge’s find-\nings necessarily render KW’s entire testimony unbelievable is misplaced. In-\ndeed, after considering the evidence and all reasonable inference in a light\nmost favorable the prosecution, we find that the military judge—a rational\nfactfinder presumed to know the law—could have found beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that Appellant was not either subjectively or objectively mistaken\nabout FT’s age and penetrated FT’s vulva with his penis. Additionally, after\n\n\n                                        9\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nweighing the evidence presented at trial regarding Appellant’s sexual assault\nof FT and making allowances for not having observed the witnesses who tes-\ntified as to this offense, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt Appel-\nlant sexually assaulted a child, FT, by penetrating FT’s vulva with his penis.\n   3. Organizing a Violent Gang\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of the following offense, in viola-\ntion of Article 133, UCMJ:\n       [Appellant did] behave in a manner that disgraced and dishon-\n       ored [Appellant] and seriously compromised his standing as a\n       commissioned officer by wrongfully and dishonorably organiz-\n       ing individuals into a violent gang, to the disgrace of the armed\n       forces.\nAppellant, along with his gang member associates, dressed in their gang col-\nor, blue. Blue clothing and blue bandanas were found at Appellant’s residence\nalong with a picture on Appellant’s wall that read “Crips for Life” next to his\nname “Leon.” Multiple, if not all, witnesses testified, in some respect, about\nAppellant’s gang-related activities, as well as his leadership role within the\n“Crips” gang. Indeed, Appellant’s own statements confirmed his role within\nthe gang and detailed his participation in its activities.\n    Accordingly, the evidence presented at trial caused Appellant on appeal to\n“concede[] that the evidence demonstrates multiple claims by friends and\nother inmates that [Appellant] was involved in ‘gang’ activity.” However, Ap-\npellant claims that the “challenge” for us “is determining whether [Appellant]\nwas engaged in hyperbole and bravado while hanging out with under-aged\nfemales and others, whether friends or fellow inmates, that he was trying to\nimpress.” Appellant also asserts that “there was no credible evidence of any\n‘violent’ activity as alleged.” In support of his argument, Appellant once again\nattacks the credibility of witnesses and maintains that his incriminating\nstatements were merely “hyperbole and fiction to impress other inmates.”\n    After considering the evidence of this offense and all reasonable infer-\nences in a light most favorable to the prosecution, finding Appellant’s convic-\ntion of wrongfully and dishonorably organizing a violent gang legally suffi-\ncient is not a particularly difficult challenge. Appellant fancied himself the\nleader of a criminal enterprise and, at times, exaggerated his and his gang’s\nexploits while trying to “impress” his fellow inmates, who were all enlisted\nmembers. Appellant’s statements, as described by witnesses, included his\nboast that his gang called him “OG, King Cold” and that he directed all of the\ngang’s activities. Appellant also explained that in order to join the gang,\nmales had to get beaten up by the gang members and females had to have\nsexual intercourse with three gang members. Appellant also admitted that\n\n\n                                      10\n\f                  United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nhis gang would “rob people, break into schools, [and] they broke [KW]’s win-\ndow.” Appellant’s claims were corroborated by testimony describing threats\nand destruction of property. The military judge, as a reasonable factfinder,\ncould have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant organized a vio-\nlent gang. Moreover, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Appel-\nlant organized this so-called “Crips” gang, he was the unquestioned leader of\nthe gang, his gang was violent, and that he is guilty of this Article 133 of-\nfense.\n   4. Prostitution Ring\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of the following offense, in viola-\ntion of Article 134, UCMJ:\n       [Appellant did] wrongfully receive valuable consideration, to\n       wit: money, on account of arranging for K.W., P.W., W.K., and\n       other unnamed persons to engage in acts of sexual intercourse\n       with unnamed persons, which conduct, under the circumstanc-\n       es, was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n    Appellant described his gang’s main activities as “drugs, prostitution,\n[and] burglary,” according to JG. With regard to the “prostitution ring,” JG\ntestified, on direct examination from trial counsel:\n       Q. Did he talk about what his involvement would be with the\n       drugs and prostitution? What would be his involvement with\n       that?\n       A. He would basically just run things behind the scenes. He\n       would let his gang members actually deal hands-on.\n       Q. Did he talk about whether he made the decisions?\n       A. Yes, he said that anything that goes on in his gang is run\n       through him first.\n       ....\n       Q. Did you hear anything about prostitution?\n       A. Yes, they had a prostitution ring, and they had girls ranging\n       in ages from 15 to 21. The younger girls would bring in. . .\n       They would charge more for the younger girls. It was kind of\n       run with him and a girl called [WK], who goes by Nona. She\n       kind of headed that up. I am not sure how they recruited the\n       girls or anything like that.\n       ....\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. Did he talk about what the money exchange would be for the\n       prostitution?\n       A. Like $300.00 to $800.00.\n       Q. Sorry?\n       A. $300.00 to $800.00. The younger girls would bring in more\n       money, so they would get charged more.\n    JG testified during cross-examination that Appellant indicated that he re-\nceived a 70 percent cut on all money the gang received from prostitution. Fur-\nther, AB DE testified that Appellant stated that “they ran a prostitution ring,\nthat people would come over to his house and there was girls named Nona\nand Kiki who were the prostitutes and possibly [KW]; and guys would pay\nhim to sleep with them.”\n    In addition, KW testified about witnessing people pay Appellant to have\nsex with her and on another occasion TW. KH testified about WK’s role as a\nprostitute in Appellant’s gang and how Appellant provided WK money “like it\nwas a job . . . .” TS testified that WK was a member of Appellant’s gang. TS\nalso described on direct examination how Appellant’s, and the gang’s, second-\nin-charge, CM, approached her about a “prostitution ring:”\n       Q. What was approached to you about this prostitution ring?\n       A. Just being the head person, like the head girl in the house.\n       Q. What would be your responsibilities for being the head girl\n       in the house?\n       A. Make sure that they brought the money back to him, and\n       make sure that they were actually doing what they were told\n       to.\n       Q. Did you agree to that?\n       A. No, sir.\n   The prosecution also presented an audio recording of the following con-\nversation between Appellant and another confinee, AB JS: 7\n       [AB JS:] Were you running prostitution?\n\n\n7While discussing this conversation in his Reply Brief to the Government Answer to\nCourt Order, dated 5 May 2017, Appellant states “Given the timing, it is unclear\nwhat Appellant is referencing; admittedly, it could indeed be that he had run his own\nprostitution ring.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       [Appellant:] What?\n       [AB JS:] Were you dealing with prostitution?\n       [Appellant:] Oh yeah, I guess some girl’s angry dad knew and\n       f[****]n went to OSI.\n       [AB JS:] I heard—I heard that’s pretty big up here.\n       [Appellant:] Yeah it is; also one of those, um, one of those grain\n       silos, they were running a ring inside one of them and the cops\n       busted it.\n       [Banter by several individuals at once.]\n       [Appellant:] S[**]t, I had girls from 16 to 21.\n       [AB JS:] Yeah?\n       [Appellant:] Yeah.\n    In challenging the legal and factually sufficiency of this conviction, “[Ap-\npellant] does not dispute that multiple witnesses testified about his purport-\ned involvement in gang activity. The dispute is that there was no credible ev-\nidence of violence [sic] or that, as argued below, his alleged involvement was\nanything more than empty boasting.” Appellant maintains there is “absolute-\nly no credible evidence whatsoever of any prostitution activity or of any ‘mon-\ney exchange’. . . .[T]here is no money, no arrests, and no name of the alleged\n‘John’ in [the PW] incident.” Most importantly to Appellant, PW did not testi-\nfy. In addition, Appellant again argues “KW’s testimony has already been\ndiscredited by the military judge’s findings with respect to her claims.” Appel-\nlant furthers his argument by citing his acquittal of conspiracy to engage in\npandering and challenging the credibility of witnesses.\n    Once again, we view the evidence of this offense and all reasonable infer-\nence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. Once again, we find Appel-\nlant’s conviction legally sufficient. The military judge in this case could rea-\nsonably have found Appellant’s admissions to be corroborated by witness tes-\ntimony. The military judge could have properly believed some portions of the\nwitnesses’ testimony and not others. Accordingly, the military judge as fact-\nfinder could have reasonably found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant\nwas arranging for KW, PW, WK, and others to have sex with people who paid\nhim money and that such conduct was of a nature to bring discredit upon the\narmed forces. Moreover, we a convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Ap-\npellant is guilty of arranging a service-discrediting “prostitution ring.”\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n   5. Communicating Threats\n   The military judge convicted Appellant of threatening to injure ME by\npaying someone to assault ME and threatening to hurt, injure, or kill Capt\nCM and SA JG.\n   ME was one of Appellant’s roommates. AL testified that she heard Appel-\nlant say “he had a hit out or he wanted to like get a hit out for [ME]” because\nAppellant thought ME had called law enforcement on him. Senior Airman\n(SrA) MH, who was Appellant’s friend, overheard Appellant “saying that he\nwas looking to find or pay someone to beat [ME] up.” MB, who was confined\nwith Appellant, recounted Appellant making statements about ME:\n       He didn’t say whether—I can’t remember whether [ME] owed\n       him money or somebody said that that he put out a bounty on\n       [ME] because [Appellant] wanted to get it taken care of, but\n       whatever the situation happened between those two, [Appel-\n       lant] put a bounty out and the guy ended up getting in a fight\n       or got beat up. But he didn’t know who did it, so it was never\n       paid out, so it kind of just happened.\nAB DE further testified, “[Appellant] had offered me, [Appellant] came to my\nhouse and offered me; [Appellant] said ‘I’ll give you $5,000 to anyone that\nhurts [ME] or puts him in the hospital.” Appellant was also recorded in con-\nfinement telling AB DE, “Him, her and [ME], remember that f[****]r I offered\n$5,000.00 . . . .”\n   While in pretrial confinement, Appellant also made a variety of threats\nagainst one of the prosecutors, Capt CM, and one of the investigators, SA JG,\nthat were communicated to, or overheard by fellow inmates, JG, MB, and AB\nDE. Although JG characterized Appellant as “venting,” Appellant was rec-\norded in pretrial confinement surmising, “I think communicating a threat is\nmy biggest problem.”\n   On appeal and consistent with his realization in pretrial confinement,\nAppellant concludes, “It must be conceded that the evidence demonstrates\nmultiple statements which support the government’s arguments that [Appel-\nlant] made threats about others.” Nevertheless, Appellant maintains that\nsomebody else threatened ME and that his threats against Capt CM and SA\nJG were made “in jest.”\n    Appellant’s convictions of threatening ME, Capt CM, and SA JG are legal-\nly sufficient. After viewing the evidence of these convictions in a light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, we reach the conclusion that a rational factfind-\ner could have found the essential elements of communicating a threat beyond\na reasonable doubt. We also find Appellant’s convictions factually sufficient,\n\n\n\n                                      14\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nas we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant communicated\nthreats against ME, Capt CM, and SA JG.\n   6. Unlawfully Entering ML’s Home\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of unlawfully entering ML’s dwell-\ning in December 2013.\n    Appellant maintained a relationship with AL, during which time he gave\nher his social security card, blank checks, birth certificate, and car keys. Ap-\npellant also bought AL a ring, “pipes,” and “bongs.” ML is AL’s mother. AL\nlived with ML in Berthold, North Dakota. Appellant would pick AL up from\nher home. AL eventually ended the relationship causing Appellant to request\nAL return his “stuff.” AL blocked Appellant’s phone number on her phone,\nwhich prevented her from receiving text messages directly from Appellant’s\nphone number.\n    ML and AL testified about AL’s relationship with Appellant, ML return-\ning some of Appellant’s items to him, and threatening messages AL received\nin October 2013 after the relationship ended. AL received these text messag-\nes on her mobile phone through “TextNow.com”:\n       Give me my stuff back please\n       I’m trying to be nice\n       If you Dont [sic] you have no idea.......test me\n       Nobody will ever give u [sh*t] until I get my stuff back I prom-\n       ise you… I will use every resource I have ever\n       I HATE you\n       OK its war b[***]h\n       ....\n       Are you gonna bring my things please?\n       ....\n       well when u do plz get me all my stuff back please including\n       the ring thanks\n       (1/3) If you Dont [sic] give me my things including the ring by\n       TOMORROW I promise some girls will go to you and get it and\n       they will kick your\n       (2/3) ass.. its been arranged already and you know I have the\n       influence to make it happen…good luck using another guy for\n       weed again\n       (3/3) half the town knows how u f[***]ed me over\n\n                                       15\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    During trial, particularly when the prosecution laid the evidentiary foun-\ndation for admission of the text messages, inconsistencies arose as to when\nML returned items to Appellant. ML testified that she personally returned\nitems to Appellant before AL received the aforementioned text messages. AL\ninitially testified on direct examination as follows:\n       Q. [AL], did your mom ever give anything back to [Appellant],\n       that’s the next step you mentioned?\n       A. Yeah, she gave it all back.\n       Q. Do you remember when that was?\n       A. I am not sure.\n       Q. Was it before or after these text messages, or during these\n       text messages?\n       A. It was after I got them, because I showed her them.\n       Q. So you showed your mom the text messages?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Is that what prompted the stuff being returned?\n       A. Yeah.\nThe Defense identified this conflict and objected, but the military judge ad-\nmitted the exhibit containing the text messages.\n   AL testified on cross-examination, in pertinent part, as follows:\n        Q. All right, now, if I understand, after that you at some point\n       made arrangements with your mom to return property to him,\n       correct?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Why wasn’t that done, if you knew you were going to be\n       breaking up with [Appellant] why was that not done at the\n       time you broke up with him?\n       A. Honestly, I forgot I even had it. It was a bag downstairs, like\n       I didn’t really like look at it every day. It just kind of didn’t\n       cross my mind.\n       Q. How did you end up coming across it, or how did your mom\n       come across it?\n       A. I guess, from what I remember, the text of him saying “I\n       want my stuff back.”\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. So after you get the text “I want my stuff back” then you\n       were thinking about it and you went to find the stuff, correct?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. And the same day you get the te[x]t that “I want my stuff\n       back” did you return the stuff to him?\n       A. I don’t know if it was that exact date, it might have been like\n       the day after.\n       Q. All right, did you ever indicate to him that you were not go-\n       ing to give his stuff back?\n       A. No.\n       Q. As far as when it was turned over to him, were you getting\n       your threats at that particular point, these threatening text\n       messages; or was that after the fact?\n       A. I think the threats came after.\n       Q. Right, so you basically were asked after this break up by\n       [Appellant], “Can I get my stuff back” and what you did is the\n       day after your mom took his stuff back to him, correct?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Did you go with your mom to do that?\n       A. What?\n       Q. Did you go with your mom to do that?\n       A. No.\n       Q. So, when your mom came back did she tell you that she had\n       dropped the stuff off to [Appellant]?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. So at this particular point there had not been any threats\n       yet, correct?\n       A. Not yet.\nThe military judge later clarified AL’s testimony by referencing AL to the text\nmessages:\n       Q. You just testified this morning that you thought it was may-\n       be the day after you received the text about him wanting his\n       stuff back that your mom returned it.\n\n\n\n\n                                      17\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       A. Yeah, but I think we were like out of town. I think we were\n       in Bismarck and I don’t know exactly when she brought it back.\n       I just know it was like not that long after these.\n       Q. You mentioned; did you collect the things for your mom to\n       give them back to him?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Like you got the bag?\n       A. Yeah, they were just already in a bag.\n       Q. What was in the bag?\n       A. Social Security card, birth certificate, and his car keys.\n       Q. What about the ring? Did you return the ring at that time?\n       A. No. I think we like couldn’t find it or something. I am not\n       sure, but it wasn’t given back at that time.\n       Q. Were you aware of anything else that you had that he might\n       have wanted from you?\n       A. Um, I guess the pipes and the bongs he bought me.\n       Q. Were you aware of anyone else wanting something back\n       from you around this time period?\n       A. No.\n    ML testified about “an incident where [her] house was broken into” some-\ntime in mid-December 2013. ML described going home from work around\nlunchtime and “notic[ing] immediately that the door that we have to the\nbasement was open which is normally closed.” ML explained: “So as I walked\nfarther into the entryway I could see upstairs and A[L]’s bedroom door was\nopen, which is never open. And then another bedroom door was open that is\nup there, and then I thought ‘somebody has been in the house.’”\n    ML confirmed that none of her family members had been in the house. Af-\nterwards, ML went upstairs and looked around the house. ML observed that\n“[n]othing looked like it had been touched,” so she went into the basement.\nML felt a draft on her way to the basement and noticed the curtains on the\nbasement window were “blowing.” As she got closer, she observed glass on the\nfloor and that the window had been broken. ML described the window as\nlarge with a plastic covering. ML further described the plastic being “ripped\naway” when “they had kicked the window.” ML explained it was “unusual” for\nAL’s bedroom door be open because “[AL] always keeps her bedroom door\nshut. In fact we keep a lot of the doors shut because we have cats, and we just\nlike to keep them out of there because of her allergies and stuff. So, but her\n\n                                       18\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nbedroom door is always shut anyway, usually.” ML also confirmed that no\nproperty was missing. On cross-examination, ML testified about the size of\nthe hole in the window, claiming “An adult male, I guess I just thought about\n[Appellant] would fit through it. I know we had speculated that maybe he\nhad somebody with [him] or something like that.” ML did not see Appellant\nat or near her home that day.\n   MB testified that he and Appellant discussed Appellant’s pending charges\nwhile they were confined together. On direct examination, MB relevantly re-\ncounted conversations concerning AL as follows:\n       Q. Let’s talk about [AL]. What do you remember him saying\n       about [AL]?\n       A. I guess it was his ex-girlfriend, and I guess they had a break\n       up and he was missing some documents and some things from\n       his place, and pretty much she was the reason why he was in\n       pretrial.\n       ....\n       Q. I want to bring your attention back to [AL]. Did the accused\n       ever mention anything about her home, about breaking into\n       her home?\n       A. He personally said he had nothing to do with it but one of\n       his friends or the number 2 in control, [C], and some guys went\n       over there looking for his stuff. It was never mentioned if any\n       harm was done to her or if she was there, or anything, or if\n       they found anything.\n       Q. When you said number 2 in control or his friend, what did\n       you mean?\n       A. I guess with the whole he’s a Crip, he’s number 2 in his\n       chain of command.\n       Q. What did you understand a Crip to mean?\n       A. A gang member.\nThe military judge also considered an audio-recording of Appellant in pretrial\nconfinement making the following statement: “Oh, Amity helped rob [AL’s]\nhouse; she drove all the way to Berthold to do it.” KW testified that a “girl”\nwith the first name “Amity” lived with Appellant.\n    Appellant argues that “the Government failed to prove that anyone en-\ntered the dwelling house of ML,” and “[m]oreover, even if the evidence—\nviewed in a light most favorable to the Government—demonstrates that\n\n\n\n                                      19\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nsomeone did enter ML’s home, there is no proof that the person was Appel-\nlant or someone he instructed to carry out the crime.”\n    It is apparent from the record, Appellant was convicted of this offense as a\nprincipal. See Article 77, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 877; see also R.C.M. 307, Discus-\nsion (H)(i) (“All principals are charged as if each was the perpetrator.”). A\nreasonable factfinder could find likewise. The evidence and all reasonable in-\nferences—when viewed and drawn in a light most favorable to the Prosecu-\ntion—establish Appellant’s motivation for unlawfully entering ML’s home,\nhis intent to do so, and his ability and willingness to command his gang\nmembers to do so. The evidence also suggests that someone broke ML’s\nbasement window causing a hole large enough for a person to enter the home\nand that Appellant admitted a known associate of his, Amity, “helped rob\n[AL’s] house [and] drove all the way to Berthold to do it.” Accordingly, Appel-\nlant’s conviction of unlawful entry is legally sufficient.\n    However, we have taken a “fresh, impartial look” at the evidence of this\noffense and are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant is\nguilty of the offense of unlawful entry. While the evidence establishes the le-\ngal sufficiency of Appellant’s conviction, it also raises several possibilities in-\nconsistent with Appellant’s guilt: that someone other than Appellant’s gang\nmembers entered the house on the occasion ML described; that if members of\nAppellant’s gang did go, it was without Appellant’s involvement; or that no\nentry actually occurred. Therefore, we set aside Appellant’s conviction of un-\nlawful entry and dismiss with prejudice Specification 4 of Charge VII.\n      7. Distribution of “Mushrooms” on Divers Occasions 8\n    The military judge convicted Appellant of distributing some amount of\npsilocybin, “mushrooms,” on divers occasions.\n    KW lived with Appellant for a period of time. She testified, among other\nthings, about receiving mushrooms from Appellant at least five times. She\ndescribed eating small mushrooms that made her feel “crazy, hallucinations.”\n    AL testified about seeing Appellant provide mushrooms to GB. AL de-\nscribed Appellant declaring, “Hey, I have some mushrooms,” possessing\n“three little chocolate mushrooms,” splitting one with GB, and eating a piece\nwith GB. AL recounted Appellant’s reaction to the drug, “He was just saying\nlike that me and [GB] were like witches and that he was scared of us . . . .”\nAppellant text messaged AL about this incident, stating, “Outside I thought I\n\n\n\n8   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nwas in a forest and you two witches were trying to eat me.” On cross-\nexamination, AL further discussed the mushrooms:\n       Q. Okay. Now let’s talk about those mushrooms that you are\n       saying were ingested. Did you ingest any of those?\n       A. Once, yeah.\n       Q. Okay and what did they look like?\n       A. It was a small circular chocolate, with like, you could see\n       like pieces of shrooms, like in it.\n       Q. Okay and shrooms meaning mushrooms?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. Now had you been drinking also?\n       A. No.\n       Q. Is this the time you say you saw Captain Brown use mush-\n       rooms?\n       A. No.\n       Q. A different time?\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. When you say you saw him use mushrooms, it was just a to-\n       tally different occasion? What did they look like if you saw\n       them?\n       A. Same thing.\n    During her testimony, GB recounted an incident almost identical to that\ndescribed by AL. GB described Appellant providing her a mushroom\n“wrapped in chocolate” when she visited Appellant with AL. GB also de-\nscribed Appellant looking at her and saying “he felt like he was in a forest or\nsomething and there was a witch.” GB admitted to eating one of the mush-\nrooms Appellant provided, not feeling its effects, and leaving Appellant’s\nhouse for approximately an hour. GB’s testimony on direct examination con-\ntinued, in pertinent part:\n       Q. What happened after an hour?\n       A. I had left his house, went over to another one of my friend’s\n       house and then I went back to his house and I eventually ate\n       another half of one, and then I had gone to Walmart with [AL],\n       and um, the way it hits you is like say if you go to the bathroom\n       for example, which was what I did, it hit me like when I was in\n       the bathroom stall.\n\n                                      21\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. What kind of effects did you feel from it?\n       A. I felt really kind of like woozy and happy and not like. . . I\n       kind of felt like I was floating in a way, like everything was re-\n       ally vibrant and people were staring at me. (Emphasis added).\n    Appellant discussed mushrooms and his distribution to GB in a conversa-\ntion with other confinees that was recorded by investigators:\n       [Appellant:] “Luckily there was never any pictures taken of the\n       f[***]ing huge bag of shrooms that I had. I had shrooms with\n       huge f[***]ing mushrooms caps and s[**]t.”\n       ....\n       [Appellant:] “No. I got [GB] f[***]ed up on shrooms at Walmart\n       once. She ended up getting arrested like a couple of hours later.\n       She was f[***]ed up. That was her first time taking shrooms.\n    Appellant asserts that his conviction for distributing mushrooms “on di-\nvers occasions” is legally and factually insufficient. He acknowledges that\n“[v]arious sources indicate that Appellant provided mushrooms to GB on one\noccasion.” However, Appellant believes “the military judge convicted [him]\nbased on either a misunderstanding regarding the sole distribution or her\nbelief in KW’s testimony.” Accordingly, Appellant renews his unavailing\nclaim that “[a]s a whole, KW’s testimony is too riddled with inconsistencies to\nprove any offense beyond a reasonable doubt. A reasonable factfinder would\ndisregard her testimony in its entirety . . . .”\n    Even if a reasonable factfinder disregarded KW’s testimony about Appel-\nlant’s distribution of mushrooms to her, a reasonable factfinder could have\nnonetheless convicted Appellant of distribution of mushrooms on divers occa-\nsions. Appellant concedes one distribution to GB. When viewing the evidence\nand all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a\nreasonable factfinder could have also found beyond a reasonable doubt that\nAppellant distributed mushrooms to AL, and when GB returned to his house\nafter leaving for approximately on hour and ate another half of a mushroom,\nAppellant made a second, separate distribution to GB. Unfortunately for Ap-\npellant, the military judge, as a reasonable factfinder may have properly be-\nlieved KW’s testimony regarding Appellant’s mushroom distribution despite\nher findings on other charged misconduct. Accordingly, we answer the ques-\ntion of whether a reasonable factfinder hearing the evidence of Appellant’s\nmushroom distribution one way could have found Appellant guilty of distrib-\nuting mushrooms on divers occasions in the affirmative; Appellant’s convic-\ntion is legally sufficient. Moreover, like the military judge, we are convinced\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant distributed mushrooms on two or\nmore occasions; Appellant’s conviction is factually sufficient.\n\n                                      22\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nB. Discovery 9\n   Appellant asserts a discovery violation regarding one of the witnesses, AB\nDE, who testified against him. AB DE joined the Air Force in 2010. Approxi-\nmately two years later in 2012, he met Appellant in Minot, North Dakota. AB\nDE and Appellant had a mutual friend and AB DE would frequently “hang\nout” with Appellant.\n    In May 2012, AB DE was detained at a local Walmart for shoplifting. The\nresponding officer asked AB DE about his age. AB DE replied that he was 18\nyears old. After the officer continued his efforts to confirm AB DE’s identity\nand age, AB DE informed the officer that he was actually 20 years old and\nhad provided the wrong birth date earlier. AB DE was arrested for shoplift-\ning and providing false information. AB DE was ordered to appear in local\ncourt a few days later for the charge of false information; however, the charge\nwas dismissed by the county’s prosecuting attorney because the “AF is taking\n[jurisdiction].”\n    In 2013, AB DE was under investigation by military authorities for mari-\njuana distribution and steroid use. Appellant was also under investigation at\nthe time. AB DE and Appellant discussed their investigations. AB DE was\nultimately convicted at a court-martial for marijuana distribution and steroid\nuse. During the investigation into his offenses, AB DE lied under oath to in-\nvestigators. His sentence included 32 months of confinement and a bad-\nconduct discharge. AB DE and Appellant were reunited in the Minot AFB\nconfinement facility, where AB DE starting serving his post-trial confinement\non 13 February 2014 and Appellant was ordered into pretrial confinement.\nWhile in confinement, the two talked about their cases daily.\n    The Government requested and obtained records of AB DE’s 2012 arrest\nfor shoplifting and providing false information prior to Appellant’s trial de-\nfense counsel’s specific requests for such information. However, the Govern-\nment failed to provide this previously-obtained material to the Defense in re-\nsponse to their request.\n    Appellant argues that the trial counsel’s failure to disclose this infor-\nmation about AB DE’s arrest for false information resulted in an unfair trial\n“because it would have significantly strengthened the defense’s argument\nthat [AB] DE lied to advance his own interests; DE not only lied to Air Force\nAuthorities on one occasion, he lied to civilian law enforcement on [a] sepa-\nrate occasion and thus could be said to routinely lie.”\n\n\n9   Raised pursuant to Grostefon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\f                   United States v.

Coleman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186–87\n(C.A.A.F. 2013). Accordingly, Article 46 and these implementing rules pro-\nvide a military accused statutory discovery rights that are greater than those\nafforded by the Constitution. See id. at 187; United States v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">323</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 (C.A.A.F. 2004).\n    Consequently, there are two categories of disclosure error: (1) cases in\nwhich the defense made no discovery request or merely a general request for\ndiscovery, and (2) cases in which the defense specifically requested the infor-\nmation. Coleman, 72 M.J. at 187 (citing Roberts, 59 M.J. at 326–27). The\nharmless error standard of review—“whether there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different”—applies to the first category. Id. (quoting Smith v. Cain,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (2012)). The heightened constitutional harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt standard applies to the second category. Id. “Failing to dis-\nclose requested material favorable to the defense is not harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt if the undisclosed evidence might have affected the outcome\nof the trial.” Id.\n    In reviewing discovery matters, we conduct the following two-step analy-\nsis: “first, we determine whether the information or evidence at issue was\nsubject to disclosure or discovery; second, if there was nondisclosure of such\ninformation, we test the effect of that nondisclosure on [Appellant’s] trial.” Id.\n(quoting Roberts, 59 M.J. at 325).\n    Using this analytical framework, we first quickly conclude—and the Gov-\nernment concedes—that the material pertaining to AB DE’s 2012 arrest for\nshoplifting and false information was not only subject to disclosure by the\nGovernment, but that the Government was indeed obligated to provide such\ninformation to the Defense.\n    In testing the effect of this nondisclosure on Appellant’s trial, we apply\nthe harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard. AB DE provided testimony\nregarding several of the charged offenses; however, most of his testimony was\ncorroborated by other evidence, to include Appellant’s statements. On direct\nexamination, AB DE described some of his own misconduct, including buying\ndrugs from Appellant’s roommate, and he explained how he was convicted by\na court-martial for distribution of marijuana and steroid use and consequent-\nly sentenced to confinement. AB DE’s cross-examination by Appellant’s civil-\nian defense counsel began as follows:\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\f                      United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. [AB DE], what were you actually convicted of in your court-\n       martial?\n       A. Distribution of marijuana and use of steroids.\n       Q. What were you sentenced to?\n       A. Thirty-two months.\n       Q. How much time do you have left at this point?\n       A. A little over a year.\n       Q. When was your action taken, do you know?\n       A. When was I sentenced?\n       Q. No, when did the general sign off on your conviction?\n       A. I don’t know.\n       Q. You don’t know that?\n       A. No, sir.\n       Q. And you were given what type of a discharge?\n       A. A BCD.\n       Q. A BCD?\n       A. Yes, sir.\nThe cross-examination also notably included the following:\n       Q. Now, when were there discussions between you and [ET] 10\n       about the fact that information from [Appellant] could be help-\n       ful to people in confinement? When was that discussion?\n       A. What do you mean?\n       Q. There was discussion between [ET] and other people to the\n       effect that [Appellant] was basically a Captain facing charges,\n       and information about him could help people that were in a\n       post-trial or pretrial confinement situation, was there not?\n       A. Yes.\n       ....\n\n\n\n10 ET was another Airman confined with Appellant during Appellant’s pretrial con-\nfinement at Minot AFB.\n\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n      Q. What was that conversation about?\n      A. Just the fact that it had to do with helping us out for doing\n      the right thing.\n      Q. And helping us out, meaning the other people, other than\n      the accused, correct?\n      A. Right.\n      Q. By getting all their sentences reduced, correct?\n      A. Correct.\n      ....\n      Q. Once the knowledge came out amongst you and the other\n      people that the monitoring devices were there were there dis-\n      cussions about trying to get the accused to talk about what he\n      was in there for?\n      A. Not that I know of.\n      Q. You did not have that conversation with [ET]?\n      A. Not that I know of, not that I can remember.\n      Q. Not that you can remember; did you hear the other people\n      that were in confinement with you talking about that?\n      A. The only thing they talked about was the fact they were go-\n      ing to try to get less time for what he had told them.\nAB DE’s cross-examination concluded as follows:\n      Q. When you came into the Air Force, as you have indicated,\n      you had never used drugs before, correct?\n      A. Yes, sir.\n      ....\n      Q. And then you get involved with drugs, using and possessing,\n      and distributing drugs, correct?\n      A. Yes, sir.\n      Q. Extensively involved, correct?\n      A. Not extensively.\n      Q. Well involved enough that you went to a court-martial over\n      it, correct?\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n                                      26\n\f                      United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       Q. What was the amount of marijuana you had?\n       A. Thirteen point eight ounces.\n       Q. What is the street value of that?\n       A. Five thousand dollars.\n       Q. Five thousand dollars?\n       A. Somewhere around there.\n       Q. Okay, so you were somewhat involved in marijuana?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. Correct; and then when you were contacted by OSI, you\n       were questioned and you flat-out lied to OSI, correct?\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. And you knew you were under oath, correct?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. And the reason you lied was because you thought it was to\n       your advantage to do so, correct?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. And you lied with the specific intention to deceive the people\n       that you were talking to, correct?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       CDC: Nothing further. Thank you.\n    There was no redirect examination and the prosecution rested immediate-\nly after AB DE was excused.\n    At trial, AB DE’s credibility was directly challenged and his motives to\nfabricate revealed. AB DE was shown to be a convicted drug distributor, con-\nvicted drug user, and admitted self-serving liar. AB DE also acknowledged\nthe potential for receiving some form of “help” in exchange for providing in-\ncriminating information against Appellant. These matters impacting AB DE’s\ncredibility would have been self-evident to the military judge. Accordingly, we\nhave no doubt that confronting AB DE with his lie to police about being 18\nrather than 20 years old immediately after his arrest for shoplifting at\nWalmart over two years prior to Appellant’s trial would not have affected the\noutcome of Appellant’s case. While the conduct of the prosecution in not dis-\nclosing the 2012 arrest material “was, at a minimum, negligent, and certainly\nviolated Brady, Article 46, and R.C.M. 701–703, the Government has estab-\n\n\n\n                                       27\n\f                       United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nlished that under the circumstances of this case its failure was harmless be-\nyond a reasonable doubt.” Coleman, 72 M.J. at 189.\nC. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 11\n    In general, Appellant alleges his civilian and military trial defense coun-\nsel (1) “failed to adequately challenge the testimony of key witnesses despite\npossessing evidence that these witnesses previously made contradictory\nstatements—some of which were sworn”; (2) “failed to object to material evi-\ndence offered by the Government, or move to include exculpatory evidence”;\nand (3) “failed to properly investigate the case and compile favorable evidence\nthat was easily accessible through [the Freedom of Information Act].” Appel-\nlant consequently concludes “[d]efense counsel’s performance was deficient\nand significantly prejudiced Appellant.” 12\n    In support of his complaints against his trial defense counsel, Appellant\nsubmitted several declarations and documents for our consideration. Accord-\ningly, we ordered and received declarations from his trial defense counsel in\nresponse.\n    The Sixth Amendment guarantees Appellant the right to effective assis-\ntance of counsel.

Id. (cit-\ning Mazza, 67 M.J. at 474).\n   1. Failure to Adequately Confront Witnesses\n    Appellant claims his defense counsel “failed to challenge numerous wit-\nnesses on previous inconsistencies or motive to lie.” Appellant then compiles\na “list of these inconsistencies or motives to lie that were not addressed by\ndefense counsel during cross-examination or elsewhere.” This list includes\nAppellant’s complaints with the testimony of KW, AL, JG, AB DE, and SA\nNP.\n    Appellant argues that “KW was the Government’s first and arguably most\nimportant witness.” Appellant maintains that his civilian defense counsel\nfailed to confront KW with “at least three contradictory, sworn statements to\ninvestigators.” Accordingly, Appellant identifies the following portions of\nKW’s testimony: (1) she “woke up to [Appellant] ejaculating on [her] . . .\nstomach, and there was some inside [her]”; (2) she denied having previously\nexperienced “black-outs”; and (3) she “only saw two exchanges of money be-\ntween the Appellant and other individuals regarding Appellant’s arranging\nfor prostitution.” Appellant contends that his civilian defense counsel should\nhave confronted KW’s testimony on these three points with the following\nstatements KW previously made to investigators: (1) “I don’t remember all\nthat night tell [sic] I woke up to him on top of me cumming inside of me”; (2)\n“I had a lot of mornings where I would wake up half naked and not know\nwhat happened with a random guy next to me . . . . I started having my\nfriends stay the night with me to watch me and they would tell me I disap-\npeared for a while”; and (3) “I had a lot of mornings where I would wake up\nhalf naked and not know what happened with a random guy next to me. I\nwatched most of the guys give [Appellant] money.” Appellant also argues that\n\n\n                                       29\n\f                  United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nhis defense counsel should have elicited testimony from KW regarding KW’s\nstatement that “Appellant got FT pregnant and that [FT] went to Fargo to\nget an abortion” because the Fargo clinic—the only abortion clinic in North\nDakota—“indicated that they did not have any records indicating FT visited\nthe clinic.”\n   While acknowledging that “some of the allegations made by KW did not\nresult in a guilty verdict for certain charged offenses,” Appellant maintains\nKW’s “overall credibility was crucial to the Government’s case.” According to\nAppellant, “[t]he significance of KW’s testimony on the Government’s case is\nevidenced in the closing argument of trial counsel, who referenced KW ap-\nproximately 40 times.” Therefore, Appellant concludes, “had [trial defense\ncounsel] adequately cross-examined KW, the military judge would have given\nher testimony little weight.”\n     In response, Appellant’s trial defense counsel explained that they made\nthe tactical decision not to cross-examine KW with the specific statements\nidentified by Appellant because they wanted to (1) show Appellant did not\npenetrate KW’s vulva; (2) “demonstrate KW was not intoxicated or drugged\nduring the sexual encounter”; and (3) not introduce evidence of “other times\n[KW] saw [Appellant] receive money for having sex with her.” Cross-\nexamining KW with the statements offered by Appellant would have, in trial\ndefense counsel’s estimation, defeated those purposes. With respect to KW’s\nstatement about FT’s abortion, the trial defense counsel assert that KW “did\nnot have any personal knowledge about the purported abortion but had heard\nit from someone else.”\n    Appellant next directs his allegations towards the testimony of AL, during\nwhich she testified to being in a “relationship” with Appellant. Appellant be-\nlieves his trial defense counsel should have confronted AL with a previous\nstatement in which she “denied any romantic or sexual involvement with Ap-\npellant” and evidence suggesting “[Appellant] was dating [AL].”\n    Appellant’s trial defense counsel explained that evidence suggesting Ap-\npellant, a commissioned officer who was then 27 years old, was in a romantic\nrelationship with the 16–17-year-old AL, and seemingly pressuring AL into\nsexual encounters with him in exchange for marijuana, would have been\n“quite devastating” to Appellant’s case.\n    Appellant contends that his trial defense counsel should have cross-\nexamined JG and AB DE about their clemency requests. Consequently, Ap-\npellant maintains “defense counsel never addressed the fact that both JG and\nAB DE had a motive to lie about Appellant: they were seeking clemency from\ntheir respective court-martial sentences.”\n\n\n\n\n                                     30\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    Appellant’s trial defense counsel responded to this assertion as well. Ap-\npellant’s trial defense counsel explained that JG provided favorable evidence\nto the Defense and there was no need to establish any motive for JG to lie.\nDefense counsel further explained that establishing a motive to lie for AB DE\nwould have opened the door for the admission of a prior consistent statement\nthat would have more damning that AB DE’s testimony. Consequently, trial\ndefense counsel decided not to cross-examine these witnesses about their\npost-trial clemency requests.\n    Appellant finally claims that trial defense counsel “actually hurt [his]\ncase during his cross-examination of SA NP by introducing ET’s work as a\nconfidential source after the investigation against Appellant.” (Emphasis in\noriginal). Appellant describes evidence from his Article 32, UCMJ, hearing\nthat indicates ET “worked as a registered OSI source . . . just a short time\nprior to gathering information on Appellant.” Without further explanation,\nAppellant asserts “this was a significant fact that the military judge should\nhave considered, as it calls into question the motive of both ET and the inves-\ntigators, and would likely have led to an analysis of whether the Government\ndeliberately elicited statements from Appellant after his Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel had attached.” Appellant then concludes, again without fur-\nther analysis, that there “is a reasonable probability that this analysis would\nhave limited at least portions of the audio recording from being admitted into\nevidence.”\n    ET did not testify, yet Appellant’s trial defense counsel was able to chal-\nlenge ET’s motives and credibility through SA NP’s cross-examination. Fur-\nthermore, Appellant’s trial defense counsel declared “the confinement record-\nings demonstrate that there was no good faith argument [Appellant] was be-\ning interrogated about charged offenses by an informant after invoking his\nrights to counsel.”\n    Although Appellant identified what he believes to be specific defects in his\ncounsel’s confrontation of certain witnesses, he failed to show that his coun-\nsel’s decisions were unreasonable. Accordingly, we find no reason to second-\nguess the sound decisions Appellant’s counsel made with regard to cross-\nexamining the witnesses identified by Appellant. The trial defense counsel’s\nwell-reasoned and extensive cross-examination of KW resulted in Appellant\nbeing acquitted of several serious offenses—to include the sexual offenses\nagainst KW. Moreover, trial defense counsels’ decision not to confront AL\nabout the nature of Appellant’s “relationship” with AL was reasonably in-\ntended to prevent more evidence about Appellant’s sordid relationships with\nteenage girls from being offered against him. Appellant’s counsel made simi-\nlarly sound decisions in not cross-examining JG and AB DE about their clem-\nency requests; trial defense counsel reasonably sought to avoid impeaching a\n\n\n                                      31\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nfavorable witness and to prevent prior consistent statements from being of-\nfered against Appellant. Likewise, Appellant’s counsel reasonably determined\nthat the timing of ET’s service as an informant did not impact the credibility\nof witnesses nor did it give it rise to a good faith claim that Appellant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel had been violated in any way. Such decisions\nand conclusions, under the facts of this case, can hardly be found to fall\nmeasurably below the performance ordinarily expected of fallible lawyers.\nEven if trial defense counsel’s decisions can be considered ineffective, we find\nno reasonable probability that, had these witnesses been confronted as pro-\nposed by Appellant, there would have been a different, more favorable result\nfor Appellant at trial. Appellant failed to establish his counsel were ineffec-\ntive in confronting KW, AL, JG, AB DE, and SA NP.\n   2. Failure to Object or Offer Exculpatory Evidence\n    Appellant also alleges that his counsel “were deficient in their handling of\nkey exhibits.” To support this allegation, Appellant argues that his counsel’s\n“loss of [a disk containing hundreds of pictures and texts between AL and\nAppellant] and subsequent failure to require the text messages be admitted\nin their entirety prevented the military judge from accurately assessing AL’s\ncredibility.”\n    In response to this allegation, Appellant’s counsel both maintained that\nthe disk was thoroughly reviewed and the evidence never “lost” as a copy\ncould be obtained from the Government. Moreover, Appellant’s counsel\nagreed that offering the text messages in their entirety would, apart from po-\ntentially showing Appellant and AL were in more than a “relationship” as AL\ntestified, and would “not paint [Appellant] in a positive light.” According to\nAppellant’s counsel, these text messages would once again show Appellant, a\n27-year-old commissioned officer, in relationship with a 16–17-year-old girl—\na relationship in which he discussed giving her drugs seemingly in exchange\nfor romantic encounters. The trial defense counsel explained that they “had\nthe disc when AL testified but made a strategic decision not to use it because\nthe texts were so harmful to [Appellant].”\n   Appellant further alleges that “[d]efense counsel similarly failed to re-\nquire the audio recordings from the confinement facility be admitted in their\nentirety.” Appellant surmises,\n       Had they done so, the military judge would have been able to\n       see how much the other inmates prodded Appellant for infor-\n       mation. She also would have been able to compare the Gov-\n       ernment’s cherry-picked statements with the full scope of Ap-\n       pellant’s conversations over a two-week period. Additionally,\n       the military judge would have heard Appellant deny having sex\n\n\n                                       32\n\f                    United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       with GB, deny knowing FT’s age, and been able to generally\n       gauge how much exaggeration and bravado inmates engaged in\n       while confined.\n    Appellant’s counsel describe the confinement recordings as “[o]ne of the\nmost significant problems [they] faced in the case.” Appellant explained to his\ncounsel that he engaged in these discussions because “he was trying to im-\npress the junior enlisted personnel he was confined with.” Both trial defense\ncounsel concluded the recordings were extremely prejudicial to Appellant—\nfor example, Appellant initiated conversations about his misconduct; detailed\nhis own criminal misconduct; “utilized gang and racial terminology”; used in-\nappropriate language with junior enlisted personnel; “name-called” his lead-\nership and the legal office; referred to witnesses as “b[****]es”; stated his first\nsergeant was a “d[***]head who didn’t do s[**]t for him”; talked “about want-\ning to become an attorney so he could represent organized crime an[d] make a\nlot of money”; and “discussed prior allegations for which he received non-\njudicial punishment for which the Government never found all of the evi-\ndence against him.” According to Appellant’s counsel, the aforementioned ex-\namples are “just a sample of the hours of similar conversations.” Consequent-\nly, trial defense counsel merely wanted to provide context to the limited con-\nversations offered by the Government. Trial defense counsel explained that\nthey wanted to show that Appellant’s statements in the Government’s exhibit\n“were just bravado and not true admissions of guilt.” Trial defense counsel\nfurther explained their decision not to play any more of the confinement re-\ncordings “as a strategic decision based on what [they] believe was in [Appel-\nlant’s] best interest.”\n    Finally, Appellant claims that his trial defense counsel were deficient in\nrequesting the military judge take judicial notice of the distance between\nFargo, North Dakota, and Minot, North Dakota, rather than Fargo and\nBerthold, North Dakota, which Appellant states is 24 miles farther west. Ap-\npellant concludes that his counsel “should have recognized the difference . . .\nand understood that driving farther from Fargo would provide a better alibi”\nto the unlawful entry offense.\n   In response to this claim, Appellant’s counsel agreed that they did request\nthe military judge take judicial notice of the 300.23 miles. However, Appel-\nlant’s military defense counsel asserted that Berthold was actually closer and\nmade Appellant’s alibi defense more plausible.\n    We disagree with Appellant and find that his counsel’s decisions not to of-\nfer the entirety of Appellant’s text messages with AL and the entirety of his\nrecorded conversations with enlisted inmates to be more than reasonable giv-\nen the content of those communications and the general context of Appel-\nlant’s case. Once again, Appellant’s counsel reasonably concluded that evi-\n\n                                        33\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\ndence revealing the nature of Appellant’s relationship with a teenaged girl—\nthat ostensibly included sexual innuendo and drugs—would have damaged,\nrather than helped, their case. Appellant’s counsel likewise soundly assessed\nthe objectively negative impact recordings that captured Appellant, inter alia,\nbragging about his crimes, glorifying a criminal lifestyle, degrading superiors\nand others, and using racially offensive language would have had on Appel-\nlant’s defense. Furthermore, we find that Appellant’s counsel’s request for the\nmilitary judge to take judicial notice of the distance between Fargo and Minot\nwas reasonable. Accordingly, Appellant failed to show that these strategic\nevidentiary decisions fell measurably below the performance ordinarily ex-\npected of fallible lawyers. Even if trial defense counsel’s decisions can be con-\nsidered ineffective, we find no reasonable probability that had the evidence\nchampioned by Appellant been admitted there would have been a different,\nlet alone a more favorable, result for Appellant at trial. Appellant failed to\nestablish his counsel were ineffective in handling these evidentiary matters.\n   3. Failure to Properly Investigate\n    Lastly, Appellant alleges that his “[d]efense counsel was deficient in com-\npiling favorable evidence for Appellant.” Appellant argues that he, “a legal\nlayman, was able to obtain . . . materials through his own initiative and while\nconfined.” Appellant lists the “several materials that would have helped Ap-\npellant,” as follows:\n       a. A sexual assault allegation against AC. Included in the file is\n       a transcript of a conversation between Detective MM and KW,\n       regarding the allegation that AC had sex with KW, then a mi-\n       nor. During this conversation, KW denied remembering having\n       sex with AC, her then-fiancé. She later confessed to having sex\n       with him one to five times.\n       b. Affidavit from TC, a Minot Police officer, describing AL’s ar-\n       rest for marijuana on 24 May 2014. After AL’s arrest, she was\n       taken to the Ward County jail where she denied having any-\n       thing on her person; however, a Corrections Officer found a\n       glass smoking device with burnt marijuana and a baggie of ma-\n       rijuana in her bra.\n       c. Affidavit of Probable Cause relating to the shoplifting arrest\n       of DE on 7 May 2012. During this arrest, DE lied to law en-\n       forcement about his age. The case was later transferred to the\n       Air Force.\n       d. Administrative segregation documents, dated 25 June 2014.\n       [Staff Sergeant (SSgt)] JO testified that Appellant entered seg-\n       regation on 20 June 2014 and was only there for “two, maybe\n\n\n                                       34\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n       three weeks.” [The documents show] that Appellant’s segrega-\n       tion began on 6 June 2014 and ended on 20 August 2014; a to-\n       tal of 75 days.\n       e. KW’s Facebook post on 3 June 2013, calling Appellant an\n       “amazing roommate” who knows “how to treat a ladie.” [sic]\n       f. Photos of Appellant’s apartment taken by the Minot Police\n       Department.\n(Citations omitted).\n      Appellant then argues that the “records of AC’s sexual assault allegation\n. . . and KW’s Facebook posts would have challenged KW’s credibility.” He\nmaintains that KW lied to law enforcement. Appellant also posits that KW’s\nFacebook posts “contradict[] her testimony that Appellant sexually assaulted\nher,” and when she “moved out” of Appellant’s apartment. Appellant contin-\nues to support his allegations with the following arguments:\n       TC’s affidavit would have challenged AL’s credibility; she lied\n       to [law] enforcement.\n       DE’s shoplifting record would have challenged his credibility;\n       he lied to law enforcement.\n       ....\n       The administrative segregation documents contradict SSgt\n       JO’s testimony and a memorandum he wrote detailing when\n       Appellant entered segregation. The military judge relied on\n       these dates for her ruling regarding illegal pretrial punish-\n       ment.\n       ....\n       The photos of Appellant’s apartment taken by the Minot Police\n       Department show the bed in the far corner of his room. This\n       would have made it virtually impossible for KW to have wit-\n       nessed Appellant having sex with GB from the door and in the\n       dark.\n(Citations omitted).\n    Appellant’s counsel described their pretrial preparation and related inves-\ntigation. Appellant’s counsel explained their multiple discovery requests with\nthe Government and conducting their own investigation of potential Govern-\nment witnesses—including searches of court records and social media. How-\never, Appellant’s counsel did not discover or obtain the material listed by Ap-\npellant.\n\n\n\n                                      35\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    In response to some of Appellant’s specific claims, his counsel maintain\nthat, even if they had the information cited by Appellant, they would not\nhave cross-examined KW about her sexual assault allegations against AC be-\ncause “AC was an associate of [Appellant] and discussed during the trial as\nsomeone who was part of several of the charged events and this records [sic]\nshows him having sex with underage girls, in which part of the charges\nagainst [Appellant] alleged his so-called gang was involved.” Appellant’s\ncounsel also state that they also would not have cross-examined AL about her\nmarijuana arrest because “it demonstrated that AL was using marijuana,\nwhich the Government’s evidence demonstrated was coming from [Appel-\nlant].” According to Appellant’s counsel, KW’s Facebook post apparently\n“came from [Appellant’s] Facebook page” and Appellant’s counsel asked Ap-\npellant’s family members for assistance in obtaining information from Appel-\nlant’s Facebook page.\n    Appellant’s successful efforts in obtaining information about a few wit-\nnesses and other material—even while conducted from confinement—do not,\nper se, render his counsel ineffective for failing to obtain the same infor-\nmation during their pretrial investigation. Indeed, Appellant’s trial defense\ncounsel had “a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasona-\nble decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 691. “In considering whether an investigation was thorough, ‘[w]e\naddress not what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is constitutionally\ncompelled.’” United States v. Akbar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379–80 (C.A.A.F. 2015)\n(quoting Burger v. Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111957\"><a href=\"/opinion/111957/burger-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794 (1987)). Accordingly, we find that\ntrial defense counsel took reasonable efforts to investigate and obtain,\nthrough discovery, favorable information in Appellant’s case. Their pretrial\nconduct did not fall measurably below the performance ordinarily expected of\nfallible lawyers.\n    Even if Appellant’s trial defense counsel were ineffective in uncovering\nthe information obtained by Appellant, we find no reasonable probability that\nthere would have been a different result. First, Appellant was acquitted of\nthe sexual offenses against KW. Second, AC was not a witness at trial and his\ncounsel reasonably would not have cross-examined KW about potential, simi-\nlar sexual offenses perpetrated by Appellant’s associate. Third, AL’s credibil-\nity was thoroughly examined by trial defense counsel. Additional, less-\ndamaging impeachment would not have changed the outcome of Appellant’s\ncase and Appellant has failed to show as much. The information pertaining to\nAB DE should have be disclosed by the Government, as previously discussed;\nhowever, this additional impeachment evidence would not have made a dif-\nferent result reasonably probable. In addition, Appellant testified about the\ndates he was arguably segregated during pretrial confinement. Therefore, the\nmilitary judge was able to consider this information in deciding Appellant’s\n\n                                      36\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\npretrial punishment claims; we find no reasonable probability the “adminis-\ntrative segregation documents” would have changed the military judge’s rul-\ning. Finally, the photographs of Appellant’s room arguably corroborated por-\ntions of KW’s testimony and do not create a reasonable probability of a differ-\nent outcome in Appellant’s trial.\n    Appellant’s trial defense counsel were not ineffective in their efforts to\nuncover favorable information for Appellant. However, assuming Appellant’s\ntrial defense counsel were ineffective, we further find no reasonable probabil-\nity that, even with the information obtained by Appellant, there would have\nbeen a different result.\nD. Pretrial Punishment\n   Appellant was ordered into pretrial confinement at Minot AFB, North\nDakota. During an “inspection” of the facility’s common sleeping area, mili-\ntary confinement officials, for no articulated reason, ransacked that portion of\nthe facility—throwing and littering the confinees’ items throughout the room.\nAt one point, a noncommissioned officer ripped the Velcro rank off of Appel-\nlant’s parka and threw it across the room. The conduct of these officials was\ncaptured on video.\n    At trial, Appellant claimed he suffered pretrial punishment and requested\nappropriate sentence relief. After receiving evidence, to include the video re-\ncordings of the “inspection,” the military judge determined Appellant was en-\ntitled to sentencing relief for the unreasonable delays in receiving his mail he\nexperienced while in pretrial confinement. Pertinently, the military judge de-\nclined to provide Appellant relief for the conditions of the “inspection,” find-\ning, as fact, the following:\n       One guard ripped rank off a parka at that time, and threw it,\n       but not away. No evidence provides context for why the guard\n       did that, or why they threw things around during the search.\n       The accused’s things were treated the same or better than the\n       other confine[e]s. I do not impute intent to punish based on\n       that search.\n       ....\n       The accused discussed with [DE] that [he] would try to escape\n       if he got more than six months’ confinement. That might sug-\n       gest that the only escape danger was after court-martial and\n       not before. However, it was reasonable to enforce rules aimed\n       at preventing escape throughout the period of confinement.\n   On appeal, Appellant maintains that the confinement officials’ conduct\nduring the inspection served no legitimate purpose and was punitive in na-\n\n\n                                      37\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nture. Appellant again asserts he was subjected to illegal pretrial punishment,\nentitling him to “appropriate sentence relief.”\n    Appellant bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to additional\nsentence credit due to illegal pretrial punishment under Article 13, UCMJ.\nUnited States v. Mosby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (C.A.A.F. 2002).\n   Article 13, UCMJ, provides:\n       No person, while being held for trial, may be subjected to pun-\n       ishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement upon the\n       charges pending against him, nor shall the arrest or confine-\n       ment imposed upon him be any more rigorous than the circum-\n       stances required to insure his presence, but he may be subject-\n       ed to minor punishment during that period for infractions of\n       discipline.\n10 U.S.C. § 813.\n    The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) out-\nlined the contours of Article 13, UCMJ, as follows:\n       Article 13, UCMJ, prohibits two things: (1) the imposition of\n       punishment prior to trial, and (2) conditions of arrest or pretri-\n       al confinement that are more rigorous than necessary to ensure\n       the accused’s presence for trial.

Zarbatany, 70 M.J. at 174.\n\n                                      38\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\n    “The question whether appellant is entitled to credit for a violation of Ar-\nticle 13 is a mixed question of fact and law.” Mosby, 56 M.J. at 310. A military\njudge’s findings of fact, to include a finding of no intent to punish, will not be\noverturned unless those findings are clearly erroneous. Id. “We will review de\nnovo the ultimate question whether [Appellant] is entitled to credit for a vio-\nlation of Article 13.” Id.\n    The military judge’s findings of facts are supported by the record and are\nnot clearly erroneous; however, we reach a different answer to the ultimate\nquestion of whether Appellant is entitled to credit for a violation of Article 13.\nIn her analysis, the military judge found “that there was no purpose or intent\nby any governmental authority to punish the accused.” After finding unrea-\nsonable, excessive delay in screening Appellant’s mail, the military judge\nconcluded, “All other actions were reasonably related to a legitimate govern-\nment objective.” But even if this was so—and even absent an intent to pun-\nish—the military judge failed to properly consider whether the inspection\nwas sufficiently egregious as to violate Article 13’s second prohibition. Alt-\nhough the search or inspection of the confinement sleeping area may have\nbeen reasonably related to a legitimate government objective, the military\nmembers’ behavior in conducting the search was—like the screening of Ap-\npellant’s mail—excessive. The video recording of the search displays a de-\nplorable disregard of any professional expectation or standard. The noncom-\nmissioned officers conducting the search wantonly, and with apparent\namusement, ransacked the area, throwing confinees’ personal items across\nthe room and on the floor, flipping bed frames, and tearing the rank off of\nAppellant’s parka. Appellant’s items were treated with the same disregard as\nthe other confinees. The fact that Appellant was subjected to the same egre-\ngious condition as others does not eliminate the excessive nature of the condi-\ntion. The conditions of this “search” were so excessive as to constitute pun-\nishment. Therefore, we find Appellant is entitled to some relief. After consid-\nering the nature of the Article 13 violation, to include its relatively short du-\nration, we grant Appellant one week of additional confinement credit.\nE. Post-trial and Appellate Delay\n    The convening authority took action on Appellant’s case 228 days after\nAppellant’s court-martial due to administrative and processing delays. Appel-\nlant’s record of trial was docketed with this court on 11 August 2015. Appel-\nlant’s civilian appellate defense counsel requested nine 30-day enlargements\nof time to file assignments of error. Each of these requests was granted in\nwhole, except for the ninth, which was granted in part.\n   Convicted Airmen have a due process right to timely review and appeal of\ncourts-martial convictions. United States v. Moreno, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135\n(C.A.A.F. 2006). In Moreno, the CAAF established a presumption of unrea-\n\n                                       39\n\f                   United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nsonable post-trial delay that requires a due process review when the conven-\ning authority does not take action within 120 days of trial, when a record of\ntrial is not docketed with us within 30 days of the convening authority’s ac-\ntion, and when we do not render a decision within 18 months of the case’s\ndocketing. Id. at 142.\n    Accordingly, if there is a Moreno-based presumption of unreasonable de-\nlay or an otherwise facially-unreasonable delay, we are required to conduct a\nde novo review of Appellant’s case to determine whether his due process right\nto a speedy post-trial review and appeal has been violated. Id. at 135. To re-\nsolve this question, we examine the four factors set forth in Barker v. Wingo,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (1972): “(1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the\ndelay; (3) the appellant’s assertion of the right to timely review and appeal;\nand (4) prejudice.” Moreno, 63 M.J. at 135. Moreno identified three types of\nprejudice arising from post-trial processing delay: (1) oppressive incarcera-\ntion; (2) anxiety and concern; and (3) impairment of ability to present a de-\nfense at a rehearing. Id. at 138–39 (citations omitted).\n    “We analyze each factor and make a determination as to whether that\nfactor favors the Government or the appellant.” Id. at 136. Then, we balance\nour analysis of the factors to determine whether a due process violation oc-\ncurred. Id. (citing Barker, 407 U.S. at 533) (“Courts must still engage in a dif-\nficult and sensitive balancing process.”). “No single factor is required for find-\ning a due process violation and the absence of a given factor will not prevent\nsuch a finding.” Id. However, where an appellant has not shown prejudice\nfrom the delay, there is no due process violation unless the delay is so egre-\ngious as to “adversely affect the public’s perception of the fairness and integ-\nrity of the military justice system.” United States v. Toohey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362\n(C.A.A.F. 2006).\n    Although Appellant experienced at least two periods of presumptively un-\nreasonable delay in the post-trial processing and review of his case, he has\nnot claimed any legally cognizable prejudice from the delays, and we find\nnone. Appellant also does not assert that his due process right to timely re-\nview and appeal had been violated. After conducting our analysis and balanc-\ning of the Barker factors, even considering the length and reasons for the de-\nlays, we do not find the delays so egregious that tolerating them would ad-\nversely affect the public’s perception of the fairness and integrity of the mili-\ntary justice system. See id. Therefore, we find no due process violation. How-\never, such a finding does not end our review of this matter.\n   Indeed, Appellant argues that he is entitled to “meaningful relief” in the\nform of “day-for-day credit for each day over the 120[-day Moreno] metric” in\naccordance with United States v. Tardif, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.A.A.F. 2002), rather\nthan a due process claim under Moreno. Tardif permits us to consider wheth-\n\n                                       40\n\f                     United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\ner we should exercise our power under Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. §\n866(c), to grant relief for excessive post-trial delay. 57 M.J. at 224. In resolv-\ning Appellant’s request for Tardif relief, we are guided by factors enumerated\nin United States v. Gay, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2015), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.A.A.F. 2016), with no single factor being dispositive. 13\n    The lengthy post-trial administrative delay between Appellant’s case and\naction is indefensible. See United States v. Dunbar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (C.M.A.\n1990). However, after balancing the remaining factors, to include our consid-\neration of the delay attributed to Appellant’s civilian appellate counsel, we\nconclude no extraordinary exercise of our Article 66(c) authority is warranted\nhere. Considered as a whole, Appellant’s case has not been subjected to ex-\ncessive delay, and we discern no particular harm to Appellant. The delays\nhave not lessened the disciplinary effect of Appellant’s sentence. The delays\nhave not adversely affected our ability to review Appellant’s case or grant\nhim relief, if warranted. The circumstances of Appellant’s case do not move\nus to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence imposed by the military judge\nand approved by the convening authority.\nF. Sentence Reassessment\n    Having found Appellant’s conviction of unlawful entry factually insuffi-\ncient, we have to consider whether we can reassess his sentence or whether a\nsentence rehearing is required.\n   Indeed, we have “broad discretion” when reassessing sentences. United\nStates v. Winckelmann, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (C.A.A.F. 2013). The CAAF has re-\npeatedly held that if we “can determine to [our] satisfaction that, absent any\nerror, the sentence adjudged would have been of at least a certain severity,\nthen a sentence of that severity or less will be free of the prejudicial effects of\nerror . . . .” United States v. Sales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">M.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (C.M.A. 1986). Thus, our\n\n\n13 These factors include: (1) How long the delay exceeded the standards set forth in\nMoreno; (2) what reasons, if any, the Government set forth for the delay, and wheth-\ner there is any evidence of bad faith or gross indifference to the overall post-trial pro-\ncessing of this case; (3) keeping in mind that our goal under Tardif is not to analyze\nfor prejudice, whether there is nonetheless some evidence of harm (either to the ap-\npellant or institutionally) caused by the delay; (4) whether the delay has lessened the\ndisciplinary effect of any particular aspect of the sentence, and whether relief is con-\nsistent with the dual goals of justice and good order and discipline; (5) whether there\nis any evidence of institutional neglect concerning timely post-trial processing, either\nacross the service or at a particular installation; and (6) given the passage of time,\nwhether this court can provide meaningful relief in this particular situation. Gay, 74\nM.J. at 744.\n\n\n\n\n                                           41\n\f                  United States v. Brown, No. ACM 38864\n\n\nanalysis is based on a totality of the circumstances with consideration of the\nfollowing factors: dramatic changes in the penalty landscape and exposure;\nthe forum; whether the remaining offenses capture the gravamen of the crim-\ninal conduct; whether significant or aggravating circumstances remain ad-\nmissible and relevant; and whether the remaining offenses are the type that\nwe as appellate judges have experience and familiarity with to reliably de-\ntermine what sentence would have been imposed at trial. Winckelmann, 73\nM.J. at 15–16.\n    Our decision to dismiss Appellant’s unlawful entry conviction only chang-\nes the punitive landscape of this case by six months of confinement. The re-\nmaining sexual, drug, and gang-related offenses capture the gravamen of Ap-\npellant’s criminal conduct. Moreover, the forum was military judge alone and\nwe are “more likely to be certain of what a military judge would have done.”\nId. at 16. Given our experience and familiarity with sentences appropriate for\nAppellant’s convictions, we are confident that absent any error, the military\njudge would have sentenced Appellant to at least a dismissal, confinement for\n24 years and 9 months, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. Accordingly,\na sentence rehearing in not required.\n\n                              III. CONCLUSION\n     The finding of guilt to Specification 4 of Charge VII is SET ASIDE and\nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The remaining findings and sentence, as\nreassessed, are correct in law and fact, and are AFFIRMED. Article 66(c),\nUCMJ. Appellant is credited with one week (seven days) of confinement cred-\nit for pretrial punishment suffered in violation of Article 13, UCMJ.\n\n\n                FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                KURT J.
