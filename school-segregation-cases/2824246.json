James Wyda, Federal Public Defender, Bal-\ntimore, Maryland, for Appellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\fOPINION\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge:\n\nA grand jury indicted Georges DeBeir of one count of traveling in\ninterstate commerce with the intent to engage in a sexual act with a\nminor, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. § 2423(b) (West Supp. 1999).\nAfter DeBeir pled guilty to this offense, the district court, departing\ndownward three levels from the applicable range set forth in the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines, sentenced him to five years pro-\nbation. The Government appeals. Because the circumstances and con-\nsequences of this case do not render it sufficiently atypical or\nextraordinary to remove it from the heartland of cases covered by the\napplicable guideline, the district court abused its discretion in depart-\ning downward. Accordingly, we vacate DeBeir's sentence and\nremand for resentencing.\n\nI.\n\nOn April 1, 1998, DeBeir, a 58-year-old male, first contacted\nKathy, who represented herself as a 14-year-old girl, through an inter-\nnet chat room. Actually, \"Kathy\" is a federal agent. In their initial e-\nmail conversation, DeBeir told Kathy: \"I am looking to meet a teen-\nage girl very discreetly once in a while strictly for oral sex.\"\n\nThereafter DeBeir and Kathy exchanged numerous sexually\nexplicit e-mail communications, during which he encouraged her to\nkeep their conversation and planned rendevous a secret because, if\nexposed, he \"could be in big trouble with the law.\" He explained \"if\na man my age is caught in a motel room together with a 14-year old\ngirl . . . I'll go to jail for many years . . . even at age 14, I'm sure\nyou're smart enough to know that,\" and noted that he had more to\nlose than Kathy if they were discovered because he\"would go to jail\nfor a LONG time\" whereas she was only \"a minor.\"\n\nThroughout these conversations, DeBeir discussed meeting Kathy\nso that he could teach her about oral sex. He explained that he would\npay her $150 for each visit. DeBeir also explained that he had made\nseveral prior arrangements with other teenage girls, but that when the\n\n                     2\n\fmeeting times came, the girls did not appear. Expressing disappoint-\nment with these prior attempts, DeBeir repeatedly urged Kathy to fol-\nlow through on her commitment to meet him, and stressed the\nimportance of making it easy for him to pick her out of the crowd\nwhen they were to meet. The two then discussed where and when to\nmeet and what they would be wearing.\n\nOn May 26, 1998, DeBeir contacted Kathy and told her that he\nwould come from New York to Baltimore to see her on June 3. They\nagreed to meet at a mall in downtown Baltimore and, from there, to\nproceed to a nearby hotel. DeBeir told Kathy that he would go to\nAAA to get information on hotels in downtown Baltimore. He\nexpressed concern about checking in to a hotel together because of\nthe difference in their ages and suggested that they check in sepa-\nrately in order to avoid drawing any attention to their meeting; Kathy\nagreed to his plan. At DeBeir's request, Kathy also agreed to bring\nher school uniform with her to the hotel in a gym bag so that they\ncould \"play a neat little game,\" which would involve Kathy dressing\nin the uniform without any underwear and DeBeir performing oral sex\non her while in her uniform.\n\nOn June 3, 1998, DeBeir confirmed his meeting with Kathy over\nthe internet and then traveled from New York to Baltimore; he arrived\nat the mall to meet Kathy as scheduled. An FBI agent, dressed as\nKathy, also went to the designated spot and waited there for approxi-\nmately one hour. As the agent began to leave, DeBeir approached her,\nconfirmed that she was \"Kathy,\" said that he\"owe[d] [her] an apol-\nogy,\" and asked if they could take a walk.\n\nFBI agents then arrested DeBeir; they recovered a list of area\nhotels, with phone numbers, from his pocket. The FBI later found a\ntranscript of the e-mail conversations with Kathy and similar tran-\nscripts from conversations with other purported teenage girls in\nDeBeir's car and at his home. The conversations began in the summer\nof 1997 and continued through May 1998.\n\nDeBeir pled guilty to one count of traveling interstate with intent\nto engage in a sexual act with a juvenile, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A.\n§ 2423(b). The parties agreed that the Sentencing Guidelines provide\na base level of 15 for this offense, see 1997 U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2, and\n\n                    3\n\fthat DeBeir merited a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance\nof responsibility, see id. § 3E1.1, bringing the offense level to 13.\nWith a criminal history category of I (because DeBeir had no prior\nconvictions), the sentencing range for the offense, after the adjust-\nment for acceptance of responsibility, would be 12-18 months.\n\nThe district court, however, also granted DeBeir a three-level\ndownward departure, bringing the offense level to 10, with a sentenc-\ning range of 6-12 months. The district court departed on the basis of\na combination of factors, see id. § 5K2.0, which either singly or\ntogether indicated that a longer sentence would have an adverse effect\non DeBeir \"to an exceptional degree.\" The court sentenced DeBeir to\nfive years probation, conditioned on a six-month term of home deten-\ntion with electronic monitoring. On appeal, the Government chal-\nlenges only the three-level downward departure.\n\nII.\n\nCongress enacted the Sentencing Guidelines to eliminate inequality\nin sentencing. Through the Guidelines \"Congress sought reasonable\nuniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences\nimposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offend-\ners.\" U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment 3, at 2; see also United\nStates v. Harriott, 976 F.2d 198, 202-03 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\nTo achieve this aim, the Guidelines dictate that in the usual case,\na court must sentence within the applicable guideline range. Thus,\nordinarily a guideline (despite its nomenclature) constitutes a mandate\nthat a sentencing court must adhere to, rather than simply a guide that\nit may choose to follow. See 18 U.S.C.A.§ 3553(b). As the Supreme\nCourt recently explained, \"[a] district judge now must impose on a\ndefendant a sentence falling within the range of the applicable Guide-\nline, if the case is an ordinary one.\" Koon v. United States, 518 U.S.\n81, 92 (1996) (emphasis added); see also Mistretta v. United States,\n488 U.S. 361, 367-68 (1989).\n\nIn extraordinary cases, however, a sentencing court may permissi-\nbly depart from the designated sentencing range. To do so, a court\nmust \"find[ ] that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circum-\nstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consider-\n\n                    4\n\fation by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines\nthat should result in a sentence different from that described.\" Koon,\n518 U.S. at 92 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)). In this way, the Guide-\nlines \"acknowledg[e] the wisdom, even the necessity, of sentencing\nprocedures that take into account individual circumstances.\" Id.\n\nThe Guidelines and their commentary facilitate this limited flexi-\nbility. The Guidelines do prohibit a court from taking some factors\ninto account in deciding whether to deviate from the prescribed sen-\ntencing range, but they forbid consideration of only a handful of fac-\ntors. See, e.g., U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10 (race, sex, national origin, religion,\ncreed, and socio-economic status). Otherwise, the Guidelines encour-\nage -- but do not require -- courts to consider some factors in mak-\ning departure decisions, see, e.g., id. §§ 5K2.10 (victim provocation\nas encouraged factor toward downward departure); 5K2.7 (disruption\nof government function as encouraged upward departure factor), and\ndiscourage -- but do not forbid -- consideration of other factors, see,\ne.g., id. § 5H1.2 (education and vocational skills).\n\nA court can depart on the basis of an encouraged factor if the appli-\ncable guideline has not already taken that factor into account. See\nKoon, 518 U.S. at 95-96. If the specific guideline at issue has already\ntaken an encouraged factor into account, or if the Guidelines discour-\nage reliance on a factor, a court can still depart, but \"only if the factor\nis present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the\ncase different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.\" Id.\nat 96; see also United States v. Hairston, 96 F.3d 102, 105-06 (4th\nCir. 1996).\n\nMoreover, a court may, at its discretion, consider factors not spe-\ncifically mentioned in the Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro.\ncomment 4(b), at 6-7 (list of factors \"is not exhaustive\" and \"[t]he\nCommission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure\nthat are not mentioned\"); see also United States v. Barber, 119 F.3d\n276, 280 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc). Any factor \"not expressly forbid-\nden\" by the Guidelines \"potentially may serve as a basis for depar-\nture.\" United States v. Brock, 108 F.3d 31, 35 (4th Cir. 1997); see also\nKoon, 518 U.S. at 106-07. When faced with such an unmentioned fac-\ntor, a court must consider the \"`structure and theory' of the relevant\nindividual guideline and the Guidelines as a whole, bearing in mind\n\n                     5\n\fthat departures on the basis of factors not mentioned in the Guidelines\nwill be `highly infrequent.'\" Hairston, 96 F.3d at 106 (quoting Koon,\n518 U.S. at 96).\n\nFinally, the Guidelines \"do[ ] not foreclose the possibility of an\nextraordinary case that, because of a combination of. . . characteris-\ntics or circumstances, differs significantly from the `heartland' cases\ncovered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory\npurposes of sentencing, even though none of the characteristics or cir-\ncumstances individually distinguishes the case.\" U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0\n(Commentary). The Sentencing Commission, however, noted that\n\"such cases will be extremely rare.\" Id .\n\nIn sum, despite the generally mandatory nature of the Guidelines,\nin an atypical case a district court does enjoy significant discretion in\ndeciding whether to depart from a given sentencing range. In fact, the\nSupreme Court made clear in Koon that, when reviewing a district\ncourt's decision to depart from a sentencing range, an appellate court\nmust apply a \"unitary abuse-of-discretion standard.\" Koon, 518 U.S.\nat 100; see also Barber, 119 F.3d at 282; Hairston, 96 F.3d at 106.\nErrors of law and clearly erroneous factual findings constitute abuses\nof discretion, but the Court expressly rejected the use of a bifurcated\napproach that would examine some portions of the sentencing court's\nrationale de novo and others under an abuse of discretion standard.\nSee Koon, 518 U.S. at 100; see also Barber , 119 F.3d at 283.\n\nInstead, \"with due regard to the district court's institutional advan-\ntage\" in sentencing proceedings, a reviewing court looks to \"existing\ncase law and the structure and theory of the Guidelines as a whole\"\nin order to determine whether the district court abused its discretion\nin departing from the guideline range. Hairston , 96 F.3d at 106 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). In this way \"[a]n appellate court gener-\nally gives `substantial deference' to the district court's decision to\ndepart, but appellate review is not an `empty exercise.'\" Id. (quoting\nKoon, 518 U.S. at 98).\n\nWith these principles in mind, we examine DeBeir's sentence.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Guidelines do not restrict the number of factors a court can\nconsider when deciding whether to depart from the prescribed sen-\n\n                     6\n\ftencing range. See Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 136-37\n(1991). The district court in this case reviewed a myriad of factors\nand circumstances that, taken together, assertedly warranted a three-\nlevel downward departure. Because the district court also suggested\nthat several factors alone could serve as the basis for departure, we\nreview those factors individually before considering their cumulative\nimpact, together with the other circumstances relied on by the district\ncourt. In doing so we compare the facts presented here \"with the facts\nof other Guidelines cases\" that consider similar factors (when such\ncases are available), recognizing that the issue of whether this case is\nso unusual as to warrant a departure is \"determined in large part by\n[this] comparison.\" Koon, 518 U.S. at 98; Hairston, 96 F.3d at 106.\n\nA.\n\nThe district court considered DeBeir's \"unique psychological con-\ndition\" and unusual susceptibility to abuse in prison as a basis for\ndeparture. DeBeir's attorney argued that, \"[w]herever he goes if incar-\ncerated, Mr. DeBeir will be categorized as a sexual offender and will\nbe subjected to heightened abuse and danger.\" The defense also noted\nthat, while DeBeir was detained in a local jail, other detainees repeat-\nedly told him to \"watch his back.\" In addition, an expert testified that\nDeBeir was \"extremely sensitive\" and more\"subject to responding to\nstress than most people\"; for these reasons the expert concluded that\nDeBeir was \"a lot more likely to be psychologically damaged by a\nlonger period of incarceration\" than \"most people.\" On the basis of\nsuch evidence, the district court found that any future incarceration\nwould have a \"devastating\" effect on DeBeir.\n\nTo the extent that this conclusion boils down to a finding that, due\nto the nature of DeBeir's criminal conduct, he will be harassed in\nprison, we cannot see how this brings the case outside the heartland.\nAll defendants convicted of this particular offense are potentially sub-\nject to such abuse. Granting a departure based on the nature of the\ncrime \"would eviscerate the recommended range for this crime and\nundermine the goals of the Sentencing Reform Act.\" United States v.\nWilke, 156 F.3d 749, 754 (7th Cir. 1998). As the Eighth Circuit\nrecently explained, a defendant's \"mere membership in a class of\noffenders that may be targeted by other inmates cannot make his case\nextraordinary . . . [o]therwise every [such offender] would be eligible\n\n                    7\n\ffor a departure, thwarting the Guidelines' sentences for that sort of\ncrime.\" United States v. Kapitzke, 130 F.3d 820, 822 (8th Cir. 1997)\n(reversing departure for susceptibility to abuse in prison that was\nbased on status as child pornographer and remanding to consider\nremaining valid factor alone). Indeed, if such a departure were rou-\ntinely permitted, \"[t]here would be no heartland of cases.\" Wilke, 156\nF.3d at 754; see also United States v. Drew, 131 F.3d 1269, 1271 (8th\nCir. 1997) (reversing departure based \"simply\" on defendant's status\nas child pornographer and his naivete where \"there is no good reason\nto believe [defendant] is exceedingly vulnerable to victimization\ngiven his average size and good health\").\n\nTo the extent the district court found that, regardless of his crime,\nDeBeir's psychological makeup renders him extremely vulnerable to\nabuse in prison, its ruling relied upon a permissible, though not\nencouraged, basis for departure. The Guidelines do not list extreme\nvulnerability as a departure factor. However, the Guidelines do dis-\ncourage district courts from relying solely on mental, emotional, or\nphysical condition in making departure decisions. See U.S.S.G.\n§§ 5H1.3; 5H1.4.\n\nIn Koon, the Court upheld a departure based on susceptibility to\nabuse in prison, deferring to the district court's conclusion that the\ndefendants -- police officers convicted of brutally beating motorist\nRodney King -- were \"particularly likely to be targets of abuse dur-\ning their incarceration\" because of the notoriety surrounding their\ncrimes. 518 U.S. at 111-12. Similarly, the Second Circuit in United\nStates v. Lara, 905 F.2d 599 (2d Cir. 1990), upheld the district court's\ndownward departure based on the \"extraordinary situation because of\nthe defendant's particular vulnerability\" in which \"[t]he severity of\n[the defendant's] prison term [was] exacerbated by his placement in\nsolitary confinement as the only means of segregating him\" for his\nprotection. Id. at 603. In Lara, the court specifically noted that the\ndefendant's \"diminutive size, immature appearance and bisexual ori-\nentation\" had already resulted in abuse, in the form of other inmates\nattempting to coerce the defendant into becoming a prostitute for their\npersonal and financial gain. Id. at 601-03.\n\nIn United States v. Maddox, 48 F.3d 791 (4th Cir. 1995), we like-\nwise concluded that extreme vulnerability in prison is a factor that the\n\n                    8\n\fGuidelines did not take into consideration and which could, in proper\ncircumstances, warrant departure. Id. at 798. But we cautioned that\n\"extreme vulnerability as a ground for departure . . . should be con-\nstrued very narrowly\" and held that the district court's unsubstantiated\nfindings that the defendant was \"easily led, susceptible to misuse by\nothers, meek and cautious in demeanor, and slight in appearance\" was\nnot enough to bring the case outside the heartland. Id.\n\nSeveral of our sister circuits have reached similar conclusions. For\nexample, the Seventh Circuit noted that, while courts are permitted to\nreview this factor, it should be \"reserved for extraordinary situations.\"\nWilke, 156 F.3d at 753. The Wilke court held that the defendant's sta-\ntus as a sexual offender who targeted minors, coupled with his passive\nand meek demeanor, did not provide a sufficient basis for a departure.\nId. at 752-54. The Eighth Circuit similarly found no \"substantial\natypicalities\" to warrant a downward departure where the defendant\nwas a 67-year old woman with a long history of victimization through\nabuse because it found no convincing evidence that she was particu-\nlarly susceptible to becoming a victim in prison as well. See United\nStates v. Tucker, 986 F.2d 278, 279-80 (8th Cir. 1993).\n\nWhen we compare the facts of these cases with the facts of the case\nat hand, we cannot conclude that DeBeir has demonstrated such\nsevere susceptibility to abuse in prison or unique psychological fragil-\nity as to warrant a departure based on this factor. Although DeBeir\nallegedly was taunted while briefly in the Baltimore City Jail, his situ-\nation does not come close to the abuse actually suffered by the defen-\ndant in Lara, upon which DeBeir heavily relies. See 905 F.2d at 601-\n03. Nor do the circumstances here create a potential for abuse akin to\nthat found in Koon. See 518 U.S. at 111-12. Even DeBeir's own\nexpert, although noting the likely impact of future incarceration on\nDeBeir, determined that he did not suffer any post-traumatic stress\ndisorder from his stay in the local jail. We find nothing atypical about\na defendant with no prior experience with incarceration finding such\nan incident stressful. Because \"[e]xcept under truly extraordinary cir-\ncumstances, prisons exist for those who commit crimes, not just for\ntough criminals,\" Maddox, 48 F.3d at 798, and because DeBeir has\nnot shown that his is such an extraordinary case, this factor cannot\nsupport the departure on its own.\n\n                     9\n\fThe district court also examined DeBeir's status as a resident alien\nand its potential impact on his incarceration. Specifically, the court\nnoted that if DeBeir were considered a deportable alien, he might be\nineligible for certain less restrictive confinement alternatives.\nAlthough the Guidelines prohibit reliance on national origin, see\nU.S.S.G. § 5H1.10, they do not mention alienage as a departure fac-\ntor; it therefore serves as a potential basis for departure. Indeed,\ncourts have much debated the question of the extent to which they can\nconsider alienage in departure decisions.\n\nInitially, the Second Circuit concluded that courts could consider\nalienage when \"its effect[s] [are] beyond the ordinary,\" but deter-\nmined that certain factors associated with alienage, including\nunavailability of preferred confinement options, additional detention\nprior to deportation, deportation itself, and separation from family in\nthe United States, could never serve as the basis for departure. United\nStates v. Restrepo, 999 F.2d 640, 644-47 (2d Cir. 1993). It therefore\nheld that nothing in the case before it -- a drug importation and pos-\nsession case in which the defendant was a legal alien with an Ameri-\ncan wife, three children and several siblings residing in the United\nStates -- was so unusual as to bring it outside the heartland. Id. Sev-\neral other circuits followed this reasoning. See United States v.\nVeloza, 83 F.3d 380 (11th Cir. 1996); United States v. Nnanna, 7 F.3d\n420 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 7 F.3d 1483\n(10th Cir. 1993).\n\nAll of these cases, however, pre-date Koon, which clarified that a\ndistrict court is free to consider any factor not prohibited by the\nGuidelines. See Koon, 518 U.S. at 106-07. With this newly articulated\ndirective in mind, the Seventh Circuit recently concluded that \"[t]he\ndistrict court is . . . free to consider whether[defendant's] status as\na deportable alien has resulted in unusual or exceptional hardship in\nhis conditions of confinement.\" United States v. Farouil, 124 F.3d\n838, 847 (7th Cir. 1997); see also United States v. Charry Cubillos,\n91 F.3d 1342 (9th Cir. 1996). Similarly (albeit prior to Koon), the\nD.C. Circuit ruled that a defendant's alienage could serve as the basis\nfor departure \"where the defendant's status as a deportable alien is\nlikely to cause a fortuitous increase in the severity of his sentence.\"\nUnited States v. Smith, 27 F.3d 649, 655 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (directing\ndistrict court to review factor on remand).\n\n                    10\n\fSeveral district courts have granted a departure based on alien sta-\ntus in cases where that status caused the increased severity in punish-\nment. For example, in United States v. Bakeas , 987 F. Supp. 44 (D.\nMass. 1997), the court granted a downward departure to a permanent\nresident alien who had lived in the United States for 20 years. Id. at\n51-52. The court reasoned that the case was unusual and outside the\nheartland because while Bakeas, an alien, would have to serve his\ntime in a medium security facility in another state, judges routinely\nsentence citizens convicted of the same offense (bank embezzlement)\nto minimum security prison camps or local community treatment cen-\nters for their entire confinement period. Id. at 46-52. In United States\nv. Simalavong, 924 F. Supp. 610 (D. Vt. 1995), the court granted a\ndeparture based on alienage because of the \"extraordinary\" fact that\nthe only reason defendants were subjected to imprisonment (as\nopposed to probation or home detention) was their status as aliens. Id.\nat 612-13; see also United States v. Bioyo, 1998 WL 850815, at *3\n(N.D. Ill. Dec. 2, 1998) (memorandum). But cf. United States v.\nAngel-Martinez, 988 F. Supp. 475, 482-84 (D.N.J. 1997) (no basis for\ndeparture where defendant simply argued that, as a general matter,\ndeportable aliens are treated more harshly than citizens in sentencing).\n\nUnlike Bakeas, Simalavong, and Bioyo, DeBeir's alien status was\nnot the basis for his ineligibility for less restrictive confinement.\nRather, the record before us reflects (and DeBeir concedes) that his\ninability to find a halfway house willing to take him stemmed from\nthe nature of his offense and not from his alien status. With no evi-\ndence that DeBeir's alien status had a direct adverse impact on his\nincarceration, this factor can hardly provide a basis for separating his\ncase from the norm. See United States v. Martinez-Villegas, 993 F.\nSupp. 766, 781 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (declining to depart downward based\non alienage in part because no evidence that ineligibility for halfway\nhouse was due to alien status rather than offense category); see also\nUnited States v. Pozzy, 902 F.2d 133, 139-40 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(unavailability of a halfway house not enough in itself to bring case\noutside heartland because Guidelines nowhere indicate that the Com-\nmission intended or expected that such a facility would be available\nin every case).\n\nIn addition, the district court reviewed the collateral consequences\nof incarceration on DeBeir's employment opportunities. The court\n\n                    11\n\ffound that sentencing would have an \"exponentially adverse effect\"\non DeBeir because of the difficulty that someone his age (58) would\nhave in obtaining employment in his field of international education\nfollowing a prison sentence. As with vulnerability in prison, although\nthe Guidelines do not mention adverse impact on employment, the\nKoon court recognized that it can potentially provide a valid basis for\ndeparture. See Koon, 518 U.S. at 109-10.\n\nIn Koon, the Court rejected the Government's argument that impact\non employment was an impermissible factor because it too closely\ntracked socio-economic status, a prohibited factor. Id. The Court,\nhowever, went on to conclude that the challenged sentences did not\nso severely impact the defendants' careers (in law enforcement) as to\ntake their cases outside the heartland. Id. Specifically, the Court\nexplained that \"it is not unusual for a public official who is convicted\nof using governmental authority to violate a person's rights to lose his\nor her job and to be barred from future work in that field.\" Id. at 110.\nSimilarly, it would not be unusual for an educator, convicted of trav-\neling interstate to engage in a sexual act with a minor, to be barred\nfrom future employment in education. Applied here, we find nothing\natypical or extraordinary about the consequences of incarceration on\nDeBeir's employment.\n\nWe suspect, however, that the district court did not base its ruling\nas to this factor solely on the employment consequences of DeBeir's\nincarceration. To the extent that the court relied on DeBeir's age and\nsuspected inability to find a position \"in keeping with his prior\nemployment and expertise,\" we note that the Guidelines prohibit reli-\nance on socio-economic status and discourage, but do not forbid, reli-\nance on age and employment record for purposes of departure\ndeterminations. See U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.1; 5H1.5; 5H1.10; see also\n5H1.2 (educational level as discouraged factor).\n\nWith respect to age, the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Bowser,\n941 F.2d 1019 (10th Cir. 1991), upheld a departure from the applica-\nble criminal history category based in part on the defendant's age (20)\nat the time of the prior offenses. Id. at 1024-26. Explaining that age\nalone would have been an insufficient basis for departure, the Bowser\ncourt permitted the departure because of a \"unique combination of\nfactors,\" including the close proximity in time of the prior offenses\n\n                    12\n\fand the fact that the defendant had served concurrent sentences for\nthose convictions, which combined such that the applicable criminal\nhistory category \"significantly over-represented the seriousness of\n[defendant's] criminal history.\" Id. With regard to employment his-\ntory as a factor, the Eighth Circuit in United States v. Big Crow, 898\nF.2d 1326 (8th Cir. 1990), upheld a downward departure based in part\non consideration of the defendant's exceptional 7-year steady employ-\nment record in \"not too pleasant of a job,\" which enabled him to pro-\nvide adequately for his family on an Indian Reservation with 72%\nunemployment and an estimated per capita income of $1,042. Id. at\n1331-32. DeBeir, a well-educated, mature man with a strong (but not\nextraordinary) employment record did not offer evidence in any way\nequivalent to that presented in these cases; the record here cannot sup-\nport a departure based on either age or employment history alone.\n\nThe district court also examined the impact of the negative public-\nity DeBeir received concerning his arrest, indictment, and guilty plea.\nAgain, although the Guidelines do not mention publicity as a depar-\nture factor, the Koon Court recognized that this factor could contrib-\nute to a valid departure. 518 U.S. at 111-12. In Koon, the defendants\nencountered \"widespread publicity and emotional outrage . . . from\nthe outset,\" including detailed national coverage, repeated airing of a\nvideotape of the crime, and violent riots surrounding their initial\nacquittal on state charges. Id. at 85-88, 112. The Supreme Court con-\nsidered the impact of this negative publicity as a factor leading to the\ndefendants' extreme vulnerability to abuse in prison, which in turn\nserved as a proper basis for a downward departure. Id. at 112.\n\nNewspapers in Baltimore, New York, and Belgium reported on\nDeBeir's case. The media coverage in this case, however, does not\napproach the extent of negative publicity at issue in Koon. Id. at 111-\n12. In United States v. Blount, 982 F. Supp. 327 (E.D. Pa. 1997), the\ncourt considered the publicity received by a corrections officer con-\nvicted of conspiracy to distribute drugs, which\"made quite a little\nstir,\" and determined that it \"bears little resemblance to Koon.\" Id. at\n336. The facts require a similar conclusion here. Certainly it is not\natypical for news organizations in the area where an arrest occurred,\nin the area where the defendant resides, and even in the area where\nthe defendant was raised to cover such an incident. DeBeir has not\nshown anything extraordinary about this case in terms of media atten-\n\n                    13\n\ftion or its impact on his potential incarceration that brings it outside\nthe heartland.\n\nAdditionally, the district court found that DeBeir is not a pedophile\nand relied on this factor in departing downward. The Guidelines gen-\nerally do not mention this as a departure factor. Nor does the guide-\nline applicable to DeBeir anywhere suggest, let alone require, that its\nprovisions apply only to pedophiles or other sexual deviants. See\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.2. Although the consideration of DeBeir's lack of\npsychological pathology is not forbidden and so provides a possible\nbasis for departure, it does seem to us, at least in this case, an exceed-\ningly odd basis for granting a downward departure. In order to depart\ndownward on this factor, a court would have to conclude that, in the\nheartland of cases, all defendants convicted of traveling interstate to\nengage in a sexual act with a minor technically qualify as pedophiles.\nWithout any evidence of this, we are unwilling to so conclude. Cf.\nUnited States v. Wind, 128 F.3d 1276, 1278 (8th Cir. 1997) (refusing\nto make such an assumption with respect to defendants who violate\nchild pornography statutes); United States v. Studley, 907 F.2d 254,\n258-59 (1st Cir. 1990) (reversing downward departure because \"noth-\ning exceptional\" about defendant convicted of possessing child por-\nnography, despite fact that \"he was not a child molester and [he] kept\nhis deviancy to himself\").\n\nFinally, the district court considered the \"victimless\" nature of\nDeBeir's crime due to the fact that \"Kathy\" was actually an FBI\nagent. Again the Guidelines do not forbid consideration of this factor\nand so it is a potential basis for departure. In this case, however, we\nfind nothing unusual about the fact that the intended victim of\nDeBeir's actions was a federal agent. See United States v. Costales,\n5 F.3d 480, 485-87 (11th Cir. 1993) (denying a downward departure\nbased on mitigating role, and noting that the Guidelines contemplate\nthat in some cases all the other actors will be undercover agents).\nIndeed, such covert or \"sting\" operations are not uncommon. See, e.g.,\nWind, 128 F.3d at 1277; Drew, 131 F.3d at 1270; United States v.\nMorin, 80 F.3d 124, 126, 129 (4th Cir. 1996); Bowser, 941 F.2d at\n1021; Studley, 907 F.2d at 256; United States v. Deane, 914 F.2d 11,\n12 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nFurthermore, the statute that DeBeir violated and to which the\nguideline applies punishes traveling interstate with the intent to\n\n                     14\n\fengage in a sexual act with a minor. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 2423(b). Thus\nthe relevant concern is DeBeir's intent rather than the true age or\nidentity of his intended victim. As we noted in a case involving an\nagent posing as a hired assassin, the fact that a major player in the\ncrime was a federal agent is \"simply irrelevant to whether a particular\ndefendant falls within the heartland of\" the applicable guideline.\nMorin, 80 F.3d at 129.\n\nThus, none of these factors in and of itself justifies the court's\nthree-level downward departure.\n\nB.\n\nWe must now examine whether this is one of the rare situations in\nwhich the cumulative effect of all of the circumstances in the case\nbrings it outside the heartland. See U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 (Commentary).\nIn so doing, we first review several additional factors that the district\ncourt found could not serve as the basis for a departure alone but\nnonetheless contributed to its decision to grant the departure.\n\nThe first of these additional factors is DeBeir's post-offense reha-\nbilitation effort. The Guidelines direct courts to take this factor into\naccount when determining whether a defendant is entitled to a down-\nward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. See U.S.S.G.\n§ 3E1.1 (Commentary). As an encouraged factor already taken into\naccount -- and, in this case, already the basis for a two-level down-\nward adjustment -- \"post-offense rehabilitation may provide an\nappropriate ground for departure only when present to such an excep-\ntional degree that the situation cannot be considered typical of those\ncircumstances in which an acceptance of responsibility adjustment is\ngranted.\" Brock, 108 F.3d at 35; see also Barber, 119 F.3d at 281 n.4.\nAfter his indictment, DeBeir attended approximately 32 counseling\nsessions; the district court noted his efforts but determined that they\nwere not extraordinary.\n\nThe court also considered DeBeir's asserted extreme remorse.\nAlthough recognizing the evidence of remorse in the record, including\nDeBeir's statements that he felt remorse and his attorney's comments\nconcerning the shame and guilt confronting DeBeir as a result of his\n\n                     15\n\fbehavior, the court concluded that such evidence was not atypical or\nextraordinary and did not warrant a departure on its own.\n\nFinally, the court found that DeBeir's behavior could not be con-\nsidered legally aberrant. See United States v. Glick, 946 F.2d 335 (4th\nCir. 1991). In Glick, we explained that, because the Guidelines\nalready take into account a defendant's criminal history, aberrant\nbehavior must \"mean[ ] something more than merely a first offense\";\ninstead \"[a] single act of aberrant behavior suggests a spontaneous\nand seemingly thoughtless act rather than one which was the result of\nsubstantial planning.\" Id. at 338 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe district court noted that the offense conduct in this case included\n\"an aspect of aberrant behavior,\" in that it did not seem to be chronic\nor even habitual over an extended period. The court acknowledged,\nhowever, that DeBeir's actions did not fit the Glick definition and, for\nthis reason, the \"aberrant\" nature of the conduct alone could not pro-\nvide a proper basis for departure.\n\nAs an appellate court we lack authority to review the district\ncourt's decision that departure on the basis of these factors taken indi-\nvidually was not warranted. See Brock, 108 F.3d at 32; see also\nUnited States v. Bayerle, 898 F.2d 28 (4th Cir. 1990). But we can, of\ncourse, review the court's ultimate decision to depart from the Guide-\nlines range. We therefore evaluate these additional factors only in\nconnection with the factors outlined above to determine whether this\ncase, considered as a whole, is so extraordinary as to fall outside the\nheartland. See U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 (Commentary).\n\nAs noted above, the Guidelines clearly contemplate that even if\nnone of the factors at issue taken individually warrants a departure,\nthe cumulative effect of all of the circumstances of the case may, in\nsome instances, bring it outside the heartland. This, however, is not\nsuch a case. We have studied the record thoroughly, including the\nparties' fine briefs, and have reviewed the entire complement of fac-\ntors and circumstances contributing to the district court's departure\ndecision and cannot conclude that any factor or group of factors\nbrings this case outside the norm. The circumstances of this case are\nfar removed from those found exceptional in existing case law; even\nwhen taken together, they cannot justify a departure.\n\n                     16\n\fThe crux of the district court's contrary finding seems to be its con-\nclusion that DeBeir is not the \"type of offender that the guideline is\nreally aimed at targeting.\" We cannot agree. In fact, offenses of this\nnature are increasingly committed with the help of the internet, and\nin such cases the offender must necessarily have had access to and the\nskills to use a computer. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, ___ F.3d\n___, 1999 WL 335318 (10th Cir. May 27, 1999); United States v.\nByrne, 171 F.3d 1231 (10th Cir. 1999); United States v. Young, 131\nF.3d 138, 1997 WL 745826 (4th Cir. 1997) (unpublished). Thus we\nfind nothing extraordinary about the particular factual landscape of\nthis case -- i.e., that DeBeir is an intelligent and well-educated adult,\nhas a strong employment history, had no prior exposure to life in\nprison, is neither a chronic offender nor a pedophile, was caught in\na sting operation, received coverage in the media, later attempted\ncounseling, and experienced remorse -- that brings it outside the\nheartland of cases sentenced under this guideline.\n\nAlthough in another case some or all of the factors considered here\nmight well warrant a downward departure, they do not permit a depar-\nture in this case. In the end, regardless of the number of factors a sen-\ntencing court considers when making a departure determination a\ncourt cannot stray from the sentencing range dictated by the Guide-\nlines unless the case is highly unusual. See Koon, 518 U.S. at 92-95.\nWe remain \"well aware of the difficulties that . . . the Sentencing\nGuidelines impose on district courts faced with the unenviable task of\nsentencing criminals who present sympathetic cases,\" Maddox, 48\nF.3d at 799-800, but the record before us simply cannot support the\nthree-level downward departure awarded here.\n\nIV.\n\nNeither individually nor in combination are the circumstances,\ncharacteristics, or consequences of this case so unique or extraordi-\nnary as to bring it outside the heartland of cases sentenced under this\nguideline. The district court therefore abused its discretion in granting\nthe three-level downward departure. We vacate DeBeir's sentence\nand remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\nVACATED AND REMANDED\n\n                     17\n\f",

The Government appeals. Because the circumstances and con-\nsequences of this case do not render it sufficiently atypical or\nextraordinary to remove it from the heartland of cases covered by the\napplicable guideline, the district court abused its discretion in depart-\ning downward. Accordingly, we vacate DeBeir's sentence and\nremand for resentencing.\n\nI.\n\nOn April 1, 1998, DeBeir, a 58-year-old male, first contacted\nKathy, who represented herself as a 14-year-old girl, through an inter-\nnet chat room. Actually, \"Kathy\" is a federal agent. In their initial e-\nmail conversation, DeBeir told Kathy: \"I am looking to meet a teen-\nage girl very discreetly once in a while strictly for oral sex.\"\n\nThereafter DeBeir and Kathy exchanged numerous sexually\nexplicit e-mail communications, during which he encouraged her to\nkeep their conversation and planned rendevous a secret because, if\nexposed, he \"could be in big trouble with the law.\" He explained \"if\na man my age is caught in a motel room together with a 14-year old\ngirl . . . I'll go to jail for many years . . . even at age 14, I'm sure\nyou're smart enough to know that,\" and noted that he had more to\nlose than Kathy if they were discovered because he\"would go to jail\nfor a LONG time\" whereas she was only \"a minor.\"\n\nThroughout these conversations, DeBeir discussed meeting Kathy\nso that he could teach her about oral sex. He explained that he would\npay her $150 for each visit. DeBeir also explained that he had made\nseveral prior arrangements with other teenage girls, but that when the\n\n                     2\n\fmeeting times came, the girls did not appear. Expressing disappoint-\nment with these prior attempts, DeBeir repeatedly urged Kathy to fol-\nlow through on her commitment to meet him, and stressed the\nimportance of making it easy for him to pick her out of the crowd\nwhen they were to meet. The two then discussed where and when to\nmeet and what they would be wearing.\n\nOn May 26, 1998, DeBeir contacted Kathy and told her that he\nwould come from New York to Baltimore to see her on June 3. They\nagreed to meet at a mall in downtown Baltimore and, from there, to\nproceed to a nearby hotel. DeBeir told Kathy that he would go to\nAAA to get information on hotels in downtown Baltimore. He\nexpressed concern about checking in to a hotel together because of\nthe difference in their ages and suggested that they check in sepa-\nrately in order to avoid drawing any attention to their meeting; Kathy\nagreed to his plan. At DeBeir's request, Kathy also agreed to bring\nher school uniform with her to the hotel in a gym bag so that they\ncould \"play a neat little game,\" which would involve Kathy dressing\nin the uniform without any underwear and DeBeir performing oral sex\non her while in her uniform.\n\nOn June 3, 1998, DeBeir confirmed his meeting with Kathy over\nthe internet and then traveled from New York to Baltimore; he arrived\nat the mall to meet Kathy as scheduled. An FBI agent, dressed as\nKathy, also went to the designated spot and waited there for approxi-\nmately one hour. As the agent began to leave, DeBeir approached her,\nconfirmed that she was \"Kathy,\" said that he\"owe[d] [her] an apol-\nogy,\" and asked if they could take a walk.\n\nFBI agents then arrested DeBeir; they recovered a list of area\nhotels, with phone numbers, from his pocket. The FBI later found a\ntranscript of the e-mail conversations with Kathy and similar tran-\nscripts from conversations with other purported teenage girls in\nDeBeir's car and at his home. The conversations began in the summer\nof 1997 and continued through May 1998.\n\nDeBeir pled guilty to one count of traveling interstate with intent\nto engage in a sexual act with a juvenile, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A.\n§ 2423(b). The parties agreed that the Sentencing Guidelines provide\na base level of 15 for this offense, see 1997 U.S.S.G. § 2A3.2, and\n\n                    3\n\fthat DeBeir merited a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance\nof responsibility, see id. § 3E1.1, bringing the offense level to 13.\nWith a criminal history category of I (because DeBeir had no prior\nconvictions), the sentencing range for the offense, after the adjust-\nment for acceptance of responsibility, would be 12-18 months.\n\nThe district court, however, also granted DeBeir a three-level\ndownward departure, bringing the offense level to 10, with a sentenc-\ning range of 6-12 months. The district court departed on the basis of\na combination of factors, see id. § 5K2.0, which either singly or\ntogether indicated that a longer sentence would have an adverse effect\non DeBeir \"to an exceptional degree.\" The court sentenced DeBeir to\nfive years probation, conditioned on a six-month term of home deten-\ntion with electronic monitoring. On appeal, the Government chal-\nlenges only the three-level downward departure.\n\nII.\n\nCongress enacted the Sentencing Guidelines to eliminate inequality\nin sentencing. Through the Guidelines \"Congress sought reasonable\nuniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences\nimposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offend-\ners.\" U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment 3, at 2; see also United\nStates v. Harriott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591408\"><a href=\"/opinion/591408/united-states-v-andrew-harriott-united-states-of-america-v-andrew/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202-03 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\nTo achieve this aim, the Guidelines dictate that in the usual case,\na court must sentence within the applicable guideline range. Thus,\nordinarily a guideline (despite its nomenclature) constitutes a mandate\nthat a sentencing court must adhere to, rather than simply a guide that\nit may choose to follow. See 18 U.S.C.A.§ 3553(b). As the Supreme\nCourt recently explained, \"[a] district judge now must impose on a\ndefendant a sentence falling within the range of the applicable Guide-\nline, if the case is an ordinary one.\" Koon v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (1996) (emphasis added); see also Mistretta v.

To do so, a court\nmust \"find[ ] that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circum-\nstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consider-\n\n                    4\n\fation by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines\nthat should result in a sentence different from that described.\" Koon,\n518 U.S. at 92 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)). In this way, the Guide-\nlines \"acknowledg[e] the wisdom, even the necessity, of sentencing\nprocedures that take into account individual circumstances.\" Id.\n\nThe Guidelines and their commentary facilitate this limited flexi-\nbility. The Guidelines do prohibit a court from taking some factors\ninto account in deciding whether to deviate from the prescribed sen-\ntencing range, but they forbid consideration of only a handful of fac-\ntors. See, e.g., U.S.S.G. § 5H1.10 (race, sex, national origin, religion,\ncreed, and socio-economic status). Otherwise, the Guidelines encour-\nage -- but do not require -- courts to consider some factors in mak-\ning departure decisions, see, e.g., id. §§ 5K2.10 (victim provocation\nas encouraged factor toward downward departure); 5K2.7 (disruption\nof government function as encouraged upward departure factor), and\ndiscourage -- but do not forbid -- consideration of other factors, see,\ne.g., id. § 5H1.2 (education and vocational skills).\n\nA court can depart on the basis of an encouraged factor if the appli-\ncable guideline has not already taken that factor into account. See\nKoon, 518 U.S. at 95-96. If the specific guideline at issue has already\ntaken an encouraged factor into account, or if the Guidelines discour-\nage reliance on a factor, a court can still depart, but \"only if the factor\nis present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the\ncase different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.\" Id.\nat 96; see also United States v. Hairston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726608\"><a href=\"/opinion/726608/united-states-v-delores-elease-hairston/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105-06 (4th\nCir. 1996).\n\nMoreover, a court may, at its discretion, consider factors not spe-\ncifically mentioned in the Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro.\ncomment 4(b), at 6-7 (list of factors \"is not exhaustive\" and \"[t]he\nCommission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure\nthat are not mentioned\"); see also United States v. Barber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744072\"><a href=\"/opinion/744072/united-states-v-anthony-d-barber-united-states-of-america-v-david-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc). Any factor \"not expressly forbid-\nden\" by the Guidelines \"potentially may serve as a basis for depar-\nture.\" United States v.

When faced with such an unmentioned fac-\ntor, a court must consider the \"`structure and theory' of the relevant\nindividual guideline and the Guidelines as a whole, bearing in mind\n\n                     5\n\fthat departures on the basis of factors not mentioned in the Guidelines\nwill be `highly infrequent.'\" Hairston, 96 F.3d at 106 (quoting Koon,\n518 U.S. at 96).\n\nFinally, the Guidelines \"do[ ] not foreclose the possibility of an\nextraordinary case that, because of a combination of. . . characteris-\ntics or circumstances, differs significantly from the `heartland' cases\ncovered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory\npurposes of sentencing, even though none of the characteristics or cir-\ncumstances individually distinguishes the case.\" U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0\n(Commentary). The Sentencing Commission, however, noted that\n\"such cases will be extremely rare.\" Id .\n\nIn sum, despite the generally mandatory nature of the Guidelines,\nin an atypical case a district court does enjoy significant discretion in\ndeciding whether to depart from a given sentencing range. In fact, the\nSupreme Court made clear in Koon that, when reviewing a district\ncourt's decision to depart from a sentencing range, an appellate court\nmust apply a \"unitary abuse-of-discretion standard.\" Koon, 518 U.S.\nat 100; see also Barber, 119 F.3d at 282; Hairston, 96 F.3d at 106.\nErrors of law and clearly erroneous factual findings constitute abuses\nof discretion, but the Court expressly rejected the use of a bifurcated\napproach that would examine some portions of the sentencing court's\nrationale de novo and others under an abuse of discretion standard.\nSee Koon, 518 U.S. at 100; see also Barber , 119 F.3d at 283.\n\nInstead, \"with due regard to the district court's institutional advan-\ntage\" in sentencing proceedings, a reviewing court looks to \"existing\ncase law and the structure and theory of the Guidelines as a whole\"\nin order to determine whether the district court abused its discretion\nin departing from the guideline range. Hairston , 96 F.3d at 106 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). In this way \"[a]n appellate court gener-\nally gives `substantial deference' to the district court's decision to\ndepart, but appellate review is not an `empty exercise.'\" Id. (quoting\nKoon, 518 U.S. at 98).\n\nWith these principles in mind, we examine DeBeir's sentence.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Guidelines do not restrict the number of factors a court can\nconsider when deciding whether to depart from the prescribed sen-\n\n                     6\n\ftencing range. See Burns v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136-37\n(1991). The district court in this case reviewed a myriad of factors\nand circumstances that, taken together, assertedly warranted a three-\nlevel downward departure. Because the district court also suggested\nthat several factors alone could serve as the basis for departure, we\nreview those factors individually before considering their cumulative\nimpact, together with the other circumstances relied on by the district\ncourt. In doing so we compare the facts presented here \"with the facts\nof other Guidelines cases\" that consider similar factors (when such\ncases are available), recognizing that the issue of whether this case is\nso unusual as to warrant a departure is \"determined in large part by\n[this] comparison.\" Koon, 518 U.S. at 98; Hairston, 96 F.3d at 106.\n\nA.\n\nThe district court considered DeBeir's \"unique psychological con-\ndition\" and unusual susceptibility to abuse in prison as a basis for\ndeparture. DeBeir's attorney argued that, \"[w]herever he goes if incar-\ncerated, Mr. DeBeir will be categorized as a sexual offender and will\nbe subjected to heightened abuse and danger.\" The defense also noted\nthat, while DeBeir was detained in a local jail, other detainees repeat-\nedly told him to \"watch his back.\" In addition, an expert testified that\nDeBeir was \"extremely sensitive\" and more\"subject to responding to\nstress than most people\"; for these reasons the expert concluded that\nDeBeir was \"a lot more likely to be psychologically damaged by a\nlonger period of incarceration\" than \"most people.\" On the basis of\nsuch evidence, the district court found that any future incarceration\nwould have a \"devastating\" effect on DeBeir.\n\nTo the extent that this conclusion boils down to a finding that, due\nto the nature of DeBeir's criminal conduct, he will be harassed in\nprison, we cannot see how this brings the case outside the heartland.\nAll defendants convicted of this particular offense are potentially sub-\nject to such abuse. Granting a departure based on the nature of the\ncrime \"would eviscerate the recommended range for this crime and\nundermine the goals of the Sentencing Reform Act.\" United States v.\nWilke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758070\"><a href=\"/opinion/758070/united-states-v-randall-wilke/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 754 (7th Cir. 1998). As the Eighth Circuit\nrecently explained, a defendant's \"mere membership in a class of\noffenders that may be targeted by other inmates cannot make his case\nextraordinary . . .

The Guidelines do not list extreme\nvulnerability as a departure factor. However, the Guidelines do dis-\ncourage district courts from relying solely on mental, emotional, or\nphysical condition in making departure decisions. See U.S.S.G.\n§§ 5H1.3; 5H1.4.\n\nIn Koon, the Court upheld a departure based on susceptibility to\nabuse in prison, deferring to the district court's conclusion that the\ndefendants -- police officers convicted of brutally beating motorist\nRodney King -- were \"particularly likely to be targets of abuse dur-\ning their incarceration\" because of the notoriety surrounding their\ncrimes. 518 U.S. at 111-12. Similarly, the Second Circuit in United\nStates v. Lara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543079\"><a href=\"/opinion/543079/united-states-v-rogelio-lara-carlos-morales-francisco-delgado-carlos/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1990), upheld the district court's\ndownward departure based on the \"extraordinary situation because of\nthe defendant's particular vulnerability\" in which \"[t]he severity of\n[the defendant's] prison term [was] exacerbated by his placement in\nsolitary confinement as the only means of segregating him\" for his\nprotection. Id. at 603. In Lara, the court specifically noted that the\ndefendant's \"diminutive size, immature appearance and bisexual ori-\nentation\" had already resulted in abuse, in the form of other inmates\nattempting to coerce the defendant into becoming a prostitute for their\npersonal and financial gain. Id. at 601-03.\n\nIn United States v. Maddox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690291\"><a href=\"/opinion/690291/united-states-v-brian-scott-maddox/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1995), we like-\nwise concluded that extreme vulnerability in prison is a factor that the\n\n                    8\n\fGuidelines did not take into consideration and which could, in proper\ncircumstances, warrant departure. Id. at 798. But we cautioned that\n\"extreme vulnerability as a ground for departure . . . should be con-\nstrued very narrowly\" and held that the district court's unsubstantiated\nfindings that the defendant was \"easily led, susceptible to misuse by\nothers, meek and cautious in demeanor, and slight in appearance\" was\nnot enough to bring the case outside the heartland. Id.\n\nSeveral of our sister circuits have reached similar conclusions. For\nexample, the Seventh Circuit noted that, while courts are permitted to\nreview this factor, it should be \"reserved for extraordinary situations.\"\nWilke, 156 F.3d at 753. The Wilke court held that the defendant's sta-\ntus as a sexual offender who targeted minors, coupled with his passive\nand meek demeanor, did not provide a sufficient basis for a departure.\nId. at 752-54. The Eighth Circuit similarly found no \"substantial\natypicalities\" to warrant a downward departure where the defendant\nwas a 67-year old woman with a long history of victimization through\nabuse because it found no convincing evidence that she was particu-\nlarly susceptible to becoming a victim in prison as well. See United\nStates v. Tucker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600455\"><a href=\"/opinion/600455/united-states-v-rachel-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 279-80 (8th Cir. 1993).\n\nWhen we compare the facts of these cases with the facts of the case\nat hand, we cannot conclude that DeBeir has demonstrated such\nsevere susceptibility to abuse in prison or unique psychological fragil-\nity as to warrant a departure based on this factor. Although DeBeir\nallegedly was taunted while briefly in the Baltimore City Jail, his situ-\nation does not come close to the abuse actually suffered by the defen-\ndant in Lara, upon which DeBeir heavily relies. See 905 F.2d at 601-\n03. Nor do the circumstances here create a potential for abuse akin to\nthat found in Koon. See 518 U.S. at 111-12. Even DeBeir's own\nexpert, although noting the likely impact of future incarceration on\nDeBeir, determined that he did not suffer any post-traumatic stress\ndisorder from his stay in the local jail. We find nothing atypical about\na defendant with no prior experience with incarceration finding such\nan incident stressful. Because \"[e]xcept under truly extraordinary cir-\ncumstances, prisons exist for those who commit crimes, not just for\ntough criminals,\" Maddox, 48 F.3d at 798, and because DeBeir has\nnot shown that his is such an extraordinary case, this factor cannot\nsupport the departure on its own.\n\n                     9\n\fThe district court also examined DeBeir's status as a resident alien\nand its potential impact on his incarceration. Specifically, the court\nnoted that if DeBeir were considered a deportable alien, he might be\nineligible for certain less restrictive confinement alternatives.\nAlthough the Guidelines prohibit reliance on national origin, see\nU.S.S.G. § 5H1.10, they do not mention alienage as a departure fac-\ntor; it therefore serves as a potential basis for departure. Indeed,\ncourts have much debated the question of the extent to which they can\nconsider alienage in departure decisions.\n\nInitially, the Second Circuit concluded that courts could consider\nalienage when \"its effect[s] [are] beyond the ordinary,\" but deter-\nmined that certain factors associated with alienage, including\nunavailability of preferred confinement options, additional detention\nprior to deportation, deportation itself, and separation from family in\nthe United States, could never serve as the basis for departure. United\nStates v. Restrepo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612089\"><a href=\"/opinion/612089/united-states-v-jorge-restrepo/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644-47 (2d Cir. 1993). It therefore\nheld that nothing in the case before it -- a drug importation and pos-\nsession case in which the defendant was a legal alien with an Ameri-\ncan wife, three children and several siblings residing in the United\nStates -- was so unusual as to bring it outside the heartland. Id. Sev-\neral other circuits followed this reasoning.

With this newly articulated\ndirective in mind, the Seventh Circuit recently concluded that \"[t]he\ndistrict court is . . . free to consider whether[defendant's] status as\na deportable alien has resulted in unusual or exceptional hardship in\nhis conditions of confinement.\" United States v.

With no evi-\ndence that DeBeir's alien status had a direct adverse impact on his\nincarceration, this factor can hardly provide a basis for separating his\ncase from the norm. See United States v. Martinez-Villegas, 993 F.\nSupp. 766, 781 (C.D.

The court\n\n                    11\n\ffound that sentencing would have an \"exponentially adverse effect\"\non DeBeir because of the difficulty that someone his age (58) would\nhave in obtaining employment in his field of international education\nfollowing a prison sentence. As with vulnerability in prison, although\nthe Guidelines do not mention adverse impact on employment, the\nKoon court recognized that it can potentially provide a valid basis for\ndeparture. See Koon, 518 U.S. at 109-10.\n\nIn Koon, the Court rejected the Government's argument that impact\non employment was an impermissible factor because it too closely\ntracked socio-economic status, a prohibited factor. Id. The Court,\nhowever, went on to conclude that the challenged sentences did not\nso severely impact the defendants' careers (in law enforcement) as to\ntake their cases outside the heartland. Id. Specifically, the Court\nexplained that \"it is not unusual for a public official who is convicted\nof using governmental authority to violate a person's rights to lose his\nor her job and to be barred from future work in that field.\" Id. at 110.\nSimilarly, it would not be unusual for an educator, convicted of trav-\neling interstate to engage in a sexual act with a minor, to be barred\nfrom future employment in education. Applied here, we find nothing\natypical or extraordinary about the consequences of incarceration on\nDeBeir's employment.\n\nWe suspect, however, that the district court did not base its ruling\nas to this factor solely on the employment consequences of DeBeir's\nincarceration. To the extent that the court relied on DeBeir's age and\nsuspected inability to find a position \"in keeping with his prior\nemployment and expertise,\" we note that the Guidelines prohibit reli-\nance on socio-economic status and discourage, but do not forbid, reli-\nance on age and employment record for purposes of departure\ndeterminations. See U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.1; 5H1.5; 5H1.10; see also\n5H1.2 (educational level as discouraged factor).\n\nWith respect to age, the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Bowser,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566442\"><a href=\"/opinion/566442/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-carland-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1991), upheld a departure from the applica-\nble criminal history category based in part on the defendant's age (20)\nat the time of the prior offenses. Id. at 1024-26. Explaining that age\nalone would have been an insufficient basis for departure, the Bowser\ncourt permitted the departure because of a \"unique combination of\nfactors,\" including the close proximity in time of the prior offenses\n\n                    12\n\fand the fact that the defendant had served concurrent sentences for\nthose convictions, which combined such that the applicable criminal\nhistory category \"significantly over-represented the seriousness of\n[defendant's] criminal history.\" Id. With regard to employment his-\ntory as a factor, the Eighth Circuit in United States v. Big Crow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538557\"><a href=\"/opinion/538557/united-states-v-david-big-crow-united-states-of-america-v-david-big-crow/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1990), upheld a downward departure based in part\non consideration of the defendant's exceptional 7-year steady employ-\nment record in \"not too pleasant of a job,\" which enabled him to pro-\nvide adequately for his family on an Indian Reservation with 72%\nunemployment and an estimated per capita income of $1,042. Id. at\n1331-32. DeBeir, a well-educated, mature man with a strong (but not\nextraordinary) employment record did not offer evidence in any way\nequivalent to that presented in these cases; the record here cannot sup-\nport a departure based on either age or employment history alone.\n\nThe district court also examined the impact of the negative public-\nity DeBeir received concerning his arrest, indictment, and guilty plea.\nAgain, although the Guidelines do not mention publicity as a depar-\nture factor, the Koon Court recognized that this factor could contrib-\nute to a valid departure. 518 U.S. at 111-12. In Koon, the defendants\nencountered \"widespread publicity and emotional outrage . . . from\nthe outset,\" including detailed national coverage, repeated airing of a\nvideotape of the crime, and violent riots surrounding their initial\nacquittal on state charges. Id. at 85-88, 112. The Supreme Court con-\nsidered the impact of this negative publicity as a factor leading to the\ndefendants' extreme vulnerability to abuse in prison, which in turn\nserved as a proper basis for a downward departure. Id. at 112.\n\nNewspapers in Baltimore, New York, and Belgium reported on\nDeBeir's case. The media coverage in this case, however, does not\napproach the extent of negative publicity at issue in Koon. Id. at 111-\n12. In United States v. Blount, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1527872\"><a href=\"/opinion/1527872/united-states-v-blount/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Pa. 1997), the\ncourt considered the publicity received by a corrections officer con-\nvicted of conspiracy to distribute drugs, which\"made quite a little\nstir,\" and determined that it \"bears little resemblance to Koon.\" Id. at\n336. The facts require a similar conclusion here. Certainly it is not\natypical for news organizations in the area where an arrest occurred,\nin the area where the defendant resides, and even in the area where\nthe defendant was raised to cover such an incident. DeBeir has not\nshown anything extraordinary about this case in terms of media atten-\n\n                    13\n\ftion or its impact on his potential incarceration that brings it outside\nthe heartland.\n\nAdditionally, the district court found that DeBeir is not a pedophile\nand relied on this factor in departing downward. The Guidelines gen-\nerally do not mention this as a departure factor. Nor does the guide-\nline applicable to DeBeir anywhere suggest, let alone require, that its\nprovisions apply only to pedophiles or other sexual deviants. See\nU.S.S.G. § 2A3.2. Although the consideration of DeBeir's lack of\npsychological pathology is not forbidden and so provides a possible\nbasis for departure, it does seem to us, at least in this case, an exceed-\ningly odd basis for granting a downward departure. In order to depart\ndownward on this factor, a court would have to conclude that, in the\nheartland of cases, all defendants convicted of traveling interstate to\nengage in a sexual act with a minor technically qualify as pedophiles.\nWithout any evidence of this, we are unwilling to so conclude.

Again the Guidelines do not forbid consideration of this factor\nand so it is a potential basis for departure.

See, e.g.,\nWind, 128 F.3d at 1277; Drew, 131 F.3d at 1270; United States v.\nMorin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715678\"><a href=\"/opinion/715678/united-states-v-andrew-scott-morin-aka-scott-morris-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126, 129 (4th Cir. 1996); Bowser, 941 F.2d at\n1021; Studley, 907 F.2d at 256; United States v. Deane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547666\"><a href=\"/opinion/547666/united-states-v-robert-p-deane/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n12 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nFurthermore, the statute that DeBeir violated and to which the\nguideline applies punishes traveling interstate with the intent to\n\n                     14\n\fengage in a sexual act with a minor. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 2423(b). Thus\nthe relevant concern is DeBeir's intent rather than the true age or\nidentity of his intended victim. As we noted in a case involving an\nagent posing as a hired assassin, the fact that a major player in the\ncrime was a federal agent is \"simply irrelevant to whether a particular\ndefendant falls within the heartland of\" the applicable guideline.\nMorin, 80 F.3d at 129.\n\nThus, none of these factors in and of itself justifies the court's\nthree-level downward departure.\n\nB.\n\nWe must now examine whether this is one of the rare situations in\nwhich the cumulative effect of all of the circumstances in the case\nbrings it outside the heartland. See U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 (Commentary).\nIn so doing, we first review several additional factors that the district\ncourt found could not serve as the basis for a departure alone but\nnonetheless contributed to its decision to grant the departure.\n\nThe first of these additional factors is DeBeir's post-offense reha-\nbilitation effort. The Guidelines direct courts to take this factor into\naccount when determining whether a defendant is entitled to a down-\nward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. See U.S.S.G.\n§ 3E1.1 (Commentary). As an encouraged factor already taken into\naccount -- and, in this case, already the basis for a two-level down-\nward adjustment -- \"post-offense rehabilitation may provide an\nappropriate ground for departure only when present to such an excep-\ntional degree that the situation cannot be considered typical of those\ncircumstances in which an acceptance of responsibility adjustment is\ngranted.\" Brock, 108 F.3d at 35; see also Barber, 119 F.3d at 281 n.4.\nAfter his indictment, DeBeir attended approximately 32 counseling\nsessions; the district court noted his efforts but determined that they\nwere not extraordinary.\n\nThe court also considered DeBeir's asserted extreme remorse.\nAlthough recognizing the evidence of remorse in the record, including\nDeBeir's statements that he felt remorse and his attorney's comments\nconcerning the shame and guilt confronting DeBeir as a result of his\n\n                     15\n\fbehavior, the court concluded that such evidence was not atypical or\nextraordinary and did not warrant a departure on its own.\n\nFinally, the court found that DeBeir's behavior could not be con-\nsidered legally aberrant. See United States v. Glick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569317\"><a href=\"/opinion/569317/united-states-v-barry-david-glick/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th\nCir. 1991). In Glick, we explained that, because the Guidelines\nalready take into account a defendant's criminal history, aberrant\nbehavior must \"mean[ ] something more than merely a first offense\";\ninstead \"[a] single act of aberrant behavior suggests a spontaneous\nand seemingly thoughtless act rather than one which was the result of\nsubstantial planning.\" Id. at 338 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe district court noted that the offense conduct in this case included\n\"an aspect of aberrant behavior,\" in that it did not seem to be chronic\nor even habitual over an extended period. The court acknowledged,\nhowever, that DeBeir's actions did not fit the Glick definition and, for\nthis reason, the \"aberrant\" nature of the conduct alone could not pro-\nvide a proper basis for departure.\n\nAs an appellate court we lack authority to review the district\ncourt's decision that departure on the basis of these factors taken indi-\nvidually was not warranted. See Brock, 108 F.3d at 32; see also\nUnited States v. Bayerle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537792\"><a href=\"/opinion/537792/united-states-v-raymond-francis-bayerle/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1990). But we can, of\ncourse, review the court's ultimate decision to depart from the Guide-\nlines range. We therefore evaluate these additional factors only in\nconnection with the factors outlined above to determine whether this\ncase, considered as a whole, is so extraordinary as to fall outside the\nheartland. See U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0 (Commentary).\n\nAs noted above, the Guidelines clearly contemplate that even if\nnone of the factors at issue taken individually warrants a departure,\nthe cumulative effect of all of the circumstances of the case may, in\nsome instances, bring it outside the heartland. This, however, is not\nsuch a case. We have studied the record thoroughly, including the\nparties' fine briefs, and have reviewed the entire complement of fac-\ntors and circumstances contributing to the district court's departure\ndecision and cannot conclude that any factor or group of factors\nbrings this case outside the norm. The circumstances of this case are\nfar removed from those found exceptional in existing case law; even\nwhen taken together, they cannot justify a departure.\n\n                     16\n\fThe crux of the district court's contrary finding seems to be its con-\nclusion that DeBeir is not the \"type of offender that the guideline is\nreally aimed at targeting.\" We cannot agree. In fact, offenses of this\nnature are increasingly committed with the help of the internet, and\nin such cases the offender must necessarily have had access to and the\nskills to use a computer. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, ___ F.3d\n___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">335318</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. May 27, 1999); United States v.\nByrne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762666\"><a href=\"/opinion/762666/united-states-v-timothy-byrne/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1999); United States v. Young, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">745826</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1997) (unpublished). Thus we\nfind nothing extraordinary about the particular factual landscape of\nthis case -- i.e., that DeBeir is an intelligent and well-educated adult,\nhas a strong employment history, had no prior exposure to life in\nprison, is neither a chronic offender nor a pedophile, was caught in\na sting operation, received coverage in the media, later attempted\ncounseling, and experienced remorse -- that brings it outside the\nheartland of cases sentenced under this guideline.\n\nAlthough in another case some or all of the factors considered here\nmight well warrant a downward departure, they do not permit a depar-\nture in this case. In the end, regardless of the number of factors a sen-\ntencing court considers when making a departure determination a\ncourt cannot stray from the sentencing range dictated by the Guide-\nlines unless the case is highly unusual. See Koon, 518 U.S. at 92-95.\nWe remain \"well aware of the difficulties that . . . the Sentencing\nGuidelines impose on district courts faced with the unenviable task of\nsentencing criminals who present sympathetic cases,\" Maddox, 48\nF.3d at 799-800, but the record before us simply cannot support the\nthree-level downward departure awarded here.\n\nIV.\n\nNeither individually nor in combination are the circumstances,\ncharacteristics, or consequences of this case so unique or extraordi-\nnary as to bring it outside the heartland of cases sentenced under this\nguideline. The district court therefore abused its discretion in granting\nthe three-level downward departure. We vacate DeBeir's sentence\nand remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\nVACATED AND REMANDED\n\n                     17\n\f</pre>",
