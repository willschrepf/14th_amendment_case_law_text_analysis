The sheriff is not appellee's <em>agent,</em> but he certainly is appellee's <em>bailee.</em> No principle is more firmly imbedded in our law than that goods seized by a sheriff pursuant to a writ of execution are held by him as the bailee of the execution-plaintiff. <em>Hartleib v.

Mr. Justice SERGEANT was writing in the more spacious days of a hundred years ago, and I can understand that then it may have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 436</span> \nbeen reasonable to immunize a school district treasurer, who was probably enjoying an honor without an honorarium, against attachments. Whatever the sonorous phrases like \"great public inconvenience\", \"being stopped in the routine of their business\", \"delay, embarrassment, and trouble\", may have meant to judges of another day, they leave me cold and unresponsive. If the rule is to be sustained upon reason, sounder reasons must be found to support it. To my way of thinking, the rationale upon which the majority relies for its conclusion most certainly does not apply to sheriffs in this day and generation. A hundred years ago sheriffs were paid in fees, and to call them from their farms, stores or taverns to give attention to business from which they derived no additional remuneration may have imposed a slight inconvenience. Now they are paid salaries, and many of them are supplied with counsel, paid by the county, who \"appear in court\", for them and on their behalf can \"answer interrogatories\", \"take care that the proceedings are regularly carried on and bail to return duly given.\" True, the sheriff of Franklin County is not entitled to a solicitor, and, perhaps, counsel fees are not an expense incurred in the performance of his duties for which he is entitled to reimbursement by the county. See Act of March 24, 1927, P.L. 68, No. 46, &#167; 1, 16 P. S. &#167; 2461. But the pother about retaining counsel which appealed to the sympathies of judges a century ago has been effectually allayed by statutes since enacted which provide ample counsel fees for sheriffs summoned as garnishees in foreign attachment.

          "html_columbia": "<p>Argued November 20, 1945.\nThis appeal is brought by the plaintiff who commenced an action in assumpsit by causing a writ of foreign attachment to be issued. The writ was dissolved by the court below because the property sought to be attached was in the hands of the sheriff under a writ of <em>de retorno habendo.</em></p>\n<p>The defendant and appellee, a Delaware corporation, hereinafter called the corporation, instituted an action of replevin against the plaintiff to recover the possession of an automobile. Plaintiff filed his bond in the sum of $2000 and retained possession. The corporation was granted a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and after argument the rule was made absolute and judgment entered for the corporation. In execution of the judgment, the corporation issued a writ of <em>de</em><em>retorno habendo.</em> On April 19, 1945, at 8:30 A.M., the sheriff served the writ and took possession of the automobile. Two hours later, at 10:30 A.M. the writ of foreign attachment was issued at plaintiff's instance and received by the sheriff. The automobile was still in the sheriff's custody, not having been returned to the corporation. The sheriff's return to the writ of foreign attachment answered that the automobile was in the sheriff's custody by virtue of the writ of <em>de retorno habendo.</em> On the corporation's motion, the learned court below dissolved the writ of foreign attachment, holding that the property was in the custody of the law and therefore not liable to attachment.</p>\n<p>It is well settled and recognized by the weight of authority that property in the custody of the law is not subject to attachment. 10 Standard Pa. Practice, Attachment, &#167; 56, p. 255; 7 C.J.S. Attachment &#167; 88, p. 258; 4 Am. Jur., Attachment and Garnishment, &#167; 387, p. 797. The rule was very early established in Pennsylvania in <em>Ross v. Clarke,</em> 1 Dallas 354, where it was held that money paid into the hands of the prothonotary was \". . . to be considered in the same state as if it had been paid into the hands of the sheriff . . .\" and was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 432</span> \nnot the subject of a foreign attachment. See also <em>Riley v. Hirst,</em><cross_reference>2 Pa. 346</cross_reference>, and <em>Bulkley v. Eckert,</em> <cross_reference>3 Pa. 368</cross_reference>. Appellant, however, contends that the general rule is not applicable to the instant case. It is his theory that after the final judgment of the court distributing the property to the corporation, the property was constructively in the hands of the corporation and the sheriff held it as the corporation's agent. We do not agree with this contention.</p>\n<p>\"The sheriff is an officer of the court, charged with the duty of executing the process of the court. . . . He is no more the<em>agent</em> of the city or school district than he is of the <em>execution</em><em>creditor . . .:\"</em> (Italics supplied.) <em>Braun, Sheriff, to use of</em><em>Louik, v. De Rosa,</em> <cross_reference>128 Pa. Super. 318</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>327</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>194 A. 514</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>518</cross_reference>. Property in the hands of the sheriff on an execution writ remains <em>in custodia legis</em> until the final step is taken and the property is delivered to the judgment creditor. As long as the property is <em>in custodia legis,</em> it cannot be attached. The rationale of this decision is supported by the reason for the general rule which is clearly set forth in <em>Bulkley v.

          "html_with_citations": "<p>Argued November 20, 1945.\nThis appeal is brought by the plaintiff who commenced an action in assumpsit by causing a writ of foreign attachment to be issued. The writ was dissolved by the court below because the property sought to be attached was in the hands of the sheriff under a writ of <em>de retorno habendo.</em></p>\n<p>The defendant and appellee, a Delaware corporation, hereinafter called the corporation, instituted an action of replevin against the plaintiff to recover the possession of an automobile. Plaintiff filed his bond in the sum of $2000 and retained possession. The corporation was granted a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and after argument the rule was made absolute and judgment entered for the corporation. In execution of the judgment, the corporation issued a writ of <em>de</em><em>retorno habendo.</em> On April 19, 1945, at 8:30 A.M., the sheriff served the writ and took possession of the automobile. Two hours later, at 10:30 A.M. the writ of foreign attachment was issued at plaintiff's instance and received by the sheriff. The automobile was still in the sheriff's custody, not having been returned to the corporation. The sheriff's return to the writ of foreign attachment answered that the automobile was in the sheriff's custody by virtue of the writ of <em>de retorno habendo.</em> On the corporation's motion, the learned court below dissolved the writ of foreign attachment, holding that the property was in the custody of the law and therefore not liable to attachment.</p>\n<p>It is well settled and recognized by the weight of authority that property in the custody of the law is not subject to attachment. 10 Standard Pa. Practice, Attachment, &#167; 56, p. 255; 7 C.J.S. Attachment &#167; 88, p. 258; 4 Am. Jur., Attachment and Garnishment, &#167; 387, p. 797. The rule was very early established in Pennsylvania in <em>Ross v. Clarke,</em> 1 Dallas 354, where it was held that money paid into the hands of the prothonotary was \". . . to be considered in the same state as if it had been paid into the hands of the sheriff . . .\" and was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 432</span> \nnot the subject of a foreign attachment. See also <em>Riley v. Hirst,</em><cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span></cross_reference>, and <em>Bulkley v. Eckert,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></span></cross_reference>. Appellant, however, contends that the general rule is not applicable to the instant case. It is his theory that after the final judgment of the court distributing the property to the corporation, the property was constructively in the hands of the corporation and the sheriff held it as the corporation's agent. We do not agree with this contention.</p>\n<p>\"The sheriff is an officer of the court, charged with the duty of executing the process of the court. . . . He is no more the<em>agent</em> of the city or school district than he is of the <em>execution</em><em>creditor . . .:\"</em> (Italics supplied.) <em>Braun, Sheriff, to use of</em><em>Louik, v. De Rosa,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3861088\"><a href=\"/opinion/4101483/braun-sheriff-to-use-of-louik-v-derosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.

Property in the hands of the sheriff on an execution writ remains <em>in custodia legis</em> until the final step is taken and the property is delivered to the judgment creditor. As long as the property is <em>in custodia legis,</em> it cannot be attached. The rationale of this decision is supported by the reason for the general rule which is clearly set forth in <em>Bulkley v. Eckert,</em>\nsupra. \"His situation [treasurer of a school district] does not appear to us to be distinguished from that of a sheriff or prothonotary, who has money in his hands as a public officer; and it has been determined that these are not liable to the process of attachment.
