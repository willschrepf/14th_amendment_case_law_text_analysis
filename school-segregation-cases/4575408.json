According to Mike Antonovich, Chairman of the\nBoard of Supervisors of Los Angeles County, these regulations are keeping the\nSalvation Army from obtaining a Community Development Block Grant to pro­\nvide emergency shelter and food to the homeless. In a memorandum (“Memo­\nrandum”) submitted to you last November, Frank Atkinson suggested that HUD’s\nban on religious counseling exceeds Establishment Clause requirements and may\ntransgress the Free Exercise Clause. The Memorandum therefore recommended\nthat the Legal and Regulatory Policy Working Group develop an administration\npolicy to enable religious organizations to participate in the delivery of govern­\nment-assisted social services to the maximum extent permissible under the First\nAmendment.\n   The restrictions to which the Salvation Army objects are generally not em­\nbodied in formal rules, but rather are contained in an addendum that HUD re­\nquires as part of its grant agreement with religious organizations. The addendum\nstates that the grantee agrees (1) not to discriminate against any employee or ap­\nplicant for employment on the basis of religion in connection with the program\n                                                     190\n\freceiving the grant,1(2) not to discriminate on the basis of religion in the provi­\nsion of funded services, (3) not to provide any religious instruction or counsel­\ning in connection with the program2, and (4) not to display any sectarian or reli­\ngious symbols or decorations in any portion of the facility used to conduct the\nprogram. The addendum further provides that no federal funds may be used to\nconstruct, rehabilitate, or restore any facility owned by a religious organization,\nexcept that “minor repairs” that are directly related to the provision of public ser­\nvices and that constitute in dollar terms only a minor portion of the federal grant\nmay be made to a facility used exclusively for non-religious purposes.\n   For the reasons stated below, we believe that HUD’s addendum interferes with\nreligious organizations’ ability to participate in the CDBG program in several re­\nspects not mandated by the Establishment Clause. First, we believe neither the\nConstitution nor the applicable statutes require religious organizations to refrain\nfrom discrimination on the basis of religion in employment as a condition of their\nreceipt of funds under the Community Development Block Grant program. We\nalso believe that the restriction on the use of federal funds to construct, rehabil­\nitate, or restore facilities owned by religious organizations is more severe than\ncurrent jurisprudence under the Establishment Clause requires. So long as reli­\ngious organizations agree to dedicate facilities constructed, rehabilitated or\nrestored with federal funds to secular purposes in perpetuity, the strictures man­\ndated by Establishment Clause jurisprudence are satisfied. Finally, the prohibi­\ntions of religious instruction or counseling and religious symbols are acceptable\nso long as they are reasonably interpreted in light of the facts of each case. See\ninfra note 17 and accompanying text.\n   After analyzing these restrictions under current Establishment Clause ju­\nrisprudence we review the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Bowen v. Kendrick,\n487 U.S. 589 (1988) and discuss its general implications for the participation of\nreligious organizations in secular social welfare programs.\n                                                    Analysis\nA. Amos Case and HUD’s Restrictions Prohibiting Discrimination in\nEmployment\n   In Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ ofLat-\nter-Day Saints v. Amos, 438 U.S. 327 (1987), the Supreme Court upheld against\n\n\n    1 In addition to this provision of the addendum, HUD’s formal regulations for the Community Development\nBlock Grants program require grantees “to document the actions undertaken to assure that no person, on the ground\nof race, color, national origin, religion, or sex, has been excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or\notherwise subjected to discrimination under any activity funded under this part.” 24 C.F R. § 570.900(c)( 1) (1988);\nsee also 49 Fed. Reg. 43,852, 43,899 (1984) (to be codified at 24 C F.R. § 570.904(a)) (proposed Oct. 31, 1984).\n    2 The HUD addendum provides that the grantee “agrees that, in connection with such public services!,] . . . it\nwill provide no religious instruction or counseling, conduct no religious worship or services, engage in no religious\nproselytizing, and exert no other religious influence in the provision of such public services.*'\n\n                                                        191\n\fan Establishment Clause challenge an exemption from title VII’s ban on religious\ndiscrimination in employment for “a religious corporation, association, educa­\ntional institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a\nparticular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such cor­\nporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities.” Id. at\n330 n. 1. Specifically, the Court held that exemption satisfied the three-part test\nset out in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), for determining whether gov­\nernment assistance to religion is permissible under the Establishment Clause. The\nCourt held that the law passed muster under the first prong of the Lemon test,\nwhich requires that legislation serve a secular purpose, because its purpose was\nto limit governmental interference with the exercise of religion. Id. at 335-36.\nThe Court held that the exemption did not have the primary purpose of advanc­\ning religion, and thus passed the second prong of the Lemon test, because it did\nnot increase the capacity of religious institutions to propagate their religion be­\nyond that which the institutions possessed prior to enactment of title VII. Id. at\n337. Finally, the Court concluded that the statute did not impermissibly entangle\nchurch and state, the third prong of the Lemon test, because it effected a com­\nplete separation between churches and title VII. Id. at 339.\n   Amos establishes that the Constitution permits an exemption for religious or­\nganizations from an otherwise generally applicable prohibition on religious dis­\ncrimination in employment and therefore suggests that HUD is not constitution­\nally obligated to require grantees to refrain from religious discrimination in hiring.\nAmos, however, does not conclusively resolve the issue of whether HUD’s reg­\nulation prohibiting religious discrimination in employment is required by the Es­\ntablishment Clause, because Amos does not address whether an organization that\npractices religious discrimination in employment is a “pervasively sectarian” in­\nstitution and therefore more likely to be ineligible to receive government finan­\ncial assistance under current Supreme Court caselaw.3 Although we have found\n\n     3 We do not believe that Amos itself implies that there is an identity between the class of institutions that are\ncharacterized as “pervasively sectarian” under the Establishment Clause and those that qualify for the exemption.\nThe exemption at issue in Amos applied to “a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society\nwith respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the canying\non by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities ” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-l. Noth­\ning in the language of the statute suggests that the exemption is available only to those religious organizations that\nare characterized “pervasively sectarian\" as a matter of constitutional jurisprudence. See, e.g., Hunt v McNair, 4 13\nU S 734, 743 (1973) (referring to “pervasively sectarian” institutions as those “in which religion is so pervasive\nthat a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission”). Indeed, since the only institutions\nthat have actually been held to be “pervasively sectarian” are parochial schools, equating “religious” with “perva­\nsively sectarian” would appear substantially to narrow the scope of the exemption.\n        The facts of the Amos case itself indicate that the exemption is available to religious organizations that are\nnot “pervasively sectarian.” The individual whose case was before the Supreme Court was employed as a building\nengineer at the Deseret Gymnasium, a non-profit facility operated by the Mormon Church 183 U S. at 330. The\ndistrict court had specifically found that “there is nothing in the running or purpose of Deseret that suggests that it\nwas intended to spread or teach the religious beliefs and doctrine and practices of sacred ritual of the Mormon\nChurch or that it was intended to be an integral part of church administration. Rather, its primary function is to pro­\nvide facilities for physical exercise and athletic games. Deseret is open to the public for annual membership fees\nor for daily or series admission fees .\"Amos v Corporation o f the Presiding Bishop of the Church o f Jesus Christ\no f Latter-Day Saints, 594 F. Supp. 791, 800-01 (D Utah 1984) (footnotes omitted), modified, 618 F Supp. 1013\n\n                                                        192\n\fno case in which this question is squarely presented, we believe the fact that an\norganization practices religious discrimination in hiring does not preclude gov­\nernment financial assistance in a manner otherwise compatible with the Estab­\nlishment Clause.\n   There is no precise definition of a “pervasively sectarian” institution. In Hunt\nv. NcNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973), the Court referred to institutions “in which reli­\ngion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the\nreligious mission.” Id. at 743. In Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426\nU.S. 736 (1976), the Court defined a “pervasively sectarian” institution some­\nwhat tautologically as an institution “so permeated by religion that the secular\nside cannot be separated from the sectarian.” Id. at 759.4\n   In practice, the concept of the “pervasively sectarian” institution has been ap­\nplied only in the context of aid to church-related schools. Courts have generally\nfound that church-related elementary and secondary schools are “pervasively sec­\ntarian,” while most post-secondary institutions have been deemed sufficiently\nsecular to permit government assistance. In making these determinations, courts\nhave looked at a variety of factors, including the degree of control by religious\norganizations, whether the school or its curriculum has the purpose of teaching\nand promoting a particular religious faith, whether there are religious restrictions\non admission to the school, whether there are required courses in theology or re­\nligious doctrine, whether participation in religious exercises is required, and\nwhether the school is an integral part of the sponsoring organization’s religious\nmission.5 In particular, two appellate courts have considered restrictions or pref­\n\n\n\n    3 ( ... continued)\n(D. Utah 1985), rev’d, 483 U.S. 327 (1987). The Supreme Court never disputed these findings of the district court\nIndeed, the only reference in the majority opinion to the religiosity of the Deseret Gymnasium was a quotation from\nthe Dedicatory Prayer offered at the opening of the facility “[may] all who assemble here, and who come for the\nbenefit of their health, and for physical blessings, may feel that they are in a house dedicated to the Lord.” 483 U.S.\nat 337. Based on the evidence adduced by the Supreme Court, the Deseret Gymnasium does not appear to be a “per­\nvasively sectarian” institution under Establishment Clause jurisprudence\n    4 In addition to the lack of a precise definition of “pervasively sectarian” institution, members of the Court dif­\nfer with respect to the significance of such a determination For example, Justice Kennedy, in his concurring opin­\nion in Bowen for himself and Justice Scalia, indicates some skepticism about the utility of the “pervasively sectar­\nian” concept. “The question in an as-applied challenge is not whether the entity is of a religious character, but how\nit spends its grant.” 487 U.S. at 624-25. The separate concurrence of Justice O’Connor as well suggests that the\nproper inquiry is whether any public funds have been used to promote religion 487 U.S. at 622. Even Justices\nBlackmun, Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens in dissent in Bowen indicated that “the Constitution does not prohibit\nthe government from supporting secular social-welfare services solely because they are provided by a religiously\naffiliated organization ” 487 U.S. at 640 Significantly for the matter under review, the dissent stated “[t]here is a\nvery real and important difference between running a soup kitchen or a hospital, and counseling pregnant teenagers ”\nId. at 641. Thus, the dissent suggests the importance of evaluating the substantive nature of the use of public funds.\nConfusingly, the dissent also indicated that the label “pervasively sectarian” may serve in some cases as a proxy\nfor a more detailed analysis of the institution, the nature of the aid, and the manner in which the aid may be used.\nId at 633, see also Roemer v Maryland Pub. Works Bd , 426 U S. 736, 758 (1976).\n    5 See, e g F elto n f Secretary, United States Dep't of Educ., 739 F 2d 48 (2d Cir. 1984), a ff d sub nom. Aguilar\nv. Felton, 473 U.S. 402 (1985).\n\n                                                         193\n\ferences in hiring as one factor that may be indicative of a “pervasively sectarian”\ninstitution.6\n   We do not believe, however, that these cases establish that any organization\nproviding social services that limits employment opportunities to adherents of a\nsingle faith is “pervasively sectarian.” Again, the only entities which have been\nfound by the courts to be “pervasively sectarian” are parochial schools. In con­\ntrast, religiously affiliated colleges—even those that grant preference in admis­\nsions or hiring to members of the sponsoring faith—have generally not been\ndeemed pervasively sectarian. See Roemer v. Maryland Pub. Works Bd., 426 U.S.\n736 (1976); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973); Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S.\n672 (1971). Moreover, even those members of the Court more apt to find an in­\nstitution to be pervasively sectarian have indicated that the Establishment Clause\nposes fewer obstacles to the involvement of religious organizations when the ac­\ntivity is not aimed at the “shaping [of] belief and changing behavior,” but “neu­\ntrally dispensing medication, food or shelter.”7 We therefore believe that the few\ncases ascribing significance to discrimination in hiring by parochial schools in\ndetermining whether such schools are “pervasively sectarian” are of limited rel­\nevance when applied to the subject under review.8\n   Nor does any statute require HUD to prohibit CDBG grantees from limiting\nemployment opportunities on the basis of religion. The statute creating the CDBG\nprogram, title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub.\nL. No. 93-383, 88 Stat. 633 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 5301-5320),\ndoes not require prohibition of religious discrimination in employment.9 More­\n\n    6 The Second Circuit held that parochial schools receiving title 1 assistance were “pervasively sectarian” be­\ncause, inter alia, they were part of a “system in which religious considerations play a key role in the selection of\nstudents and teachers, and which has as its substantial purpose the inculcation of religious values.” Felton v. Sec­\nretary, United States Dep’t ofEduc., 739 F 2d 48,68 (2d Cir 1984), a ff dsub nom. Aguilar v Felton, 473 U.S. 402\n(1985); see also Cuesnongle v. Ramos, 713 F.2d 881, 883 (1st Cir. 1983) (attributes of a “pervasively sectarian”\ninstitution include religion-based admission policies).\n    7 Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U S. 641 (1988) (Blackmun, J., dissenting)\n    8 The Memorandum for John J Knapp, General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, from\nTheodore B. Olson, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (July 1, 1983) (“Olson Memorandum”)\nwhich stated that “[A]n institution that grants preferences to members of a particular creed would by definition be\na pervasively sectarian organization,” Olson Memorandum at 19, is not to the contrary. That comment was made\nin the context of religious discrimination among potential beneficiaries of government-funded social service pro­\ngrams. While that comment may at some point require re-examination, we need not here reach the constitutional\nissue of whether discrimination among beneficianes makes an institution “pervasively sectarian,” because, as dis­\ncussed below, the statute creating the CDBG program prohibits religious discrimination in the provision of ser­\nvices. See infra note 10.\n    9 Section 109 of the 1974 Act (42 U.S.C. § 5309) provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall on the\nground of race, color, national origin, or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub­\njected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under\nthis chapter,” but does not forbid religious discnmination Section 104(b)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C § 5304(b)(2))\nfurther requires grantees to certify that their grants “will be conducted and administered in conformity with Public\nLaw 88-352 and Public Law 90-284 ” Public Law No. 88-352 is the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat 241 (cod­\nified as amended at 28 U S.C. § 1447, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971, 1975a-1975d, 2000a-2000h-6), and Public Law No.\n90-284 is the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 73 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C., 42\nU.S C , 25 U.S.C. §§ 1301 -1341, 28 U.S.C. § 1360 note). No provision of the latter act relates to discrimination in\nemployment.\n\n                                                         194\n\fover, although title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 contains a general prohi­\nbition of discrimination in federally assisted programs on the ground of race,\ncolor, or national origin, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, religious discrimination is not pro­\nhibited.10\n   The only other arguably relevant provision of the 1964 Act is title II, the pub­\nlic accommodations provision, which provides that “[a]ll persons shall be enti­\ntled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as de­\nfined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a). Although barring reli­\ngious discrimination by places of public accommodation, this section does not\napply to the employment practices of such establishments but only to their pro­\nvision of services. Accordingly, it appears that the Housing and Community De­\nvelopment Act of 1974, whose certification provision incorporates by reference\nthe Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, does not require religious organizations\nto refrain from religious discrimination in employment in connection with ac­\ntivities funded under the Act.11\n   We therefore conclude that the Constitution not only permits the granting of\nan exemption to religious organizations from otherwise applicable prohibitions\non religious discrimination in employment, but also that it permits government\nfinancial assistance to the organizations so exempted.12The act creating the block\ngrant program does not require a prohibition on religious discrimination in hir­\ning. Since HUD’s regulations flatly prohibit this form of religious discrimination\nby grantees, they are more restrictive than required by law.\nB. HUD’s Restrictions Prohibiting Rehabilitation, Restoration and\nConstruction Funds for Religious Organizations\n   The HUD regulations that prohibit use of federal funds to construct, rehabili­\ntate, or restore any facility that is owned by a religious organization are also more\nrestrictive than is constitutionally required. It is clear that there is no per se ex­\nclusion of religious institutions from the receipt of government aid under certain\ncircumstances. As the Court has stated, “[r]eligious institutions need not be quar­\nantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all.” Roemer v. Mary­\nland Pub. Works Bd., 426 U.S. 736, 746 (1976).\n    10 Title VII of the 1964 Act does forbid discrimination, including religious discrimination, in employment, but\nalso contains the exemption for reltgious organizations upheld in Amos. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e~l\n    11 The same is not true of religious discrimination in the provision of funded social services. Title II of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, as indicated in the text, prohibits religious discrimination in places of public accommodation.\nShelters appear to be places of public accommodation under the statute, since they constitute an “inn, hotel, motel,\nor other establishment which provides lodging to transient guests.” 42 U S.C. § 2000a(b)( I). Other types of social\nservice facilities may or may not fail under the statutory definition of places of public accommodation.\n    12 It is also clear that mere receipt of government financial assistance will not transform the religious organiza­\ntion into a state actor subject to constitutional prohibitions on religious discnmination. Rendell-Baker v Kohn, 457\nU.S. 830 (1982) (fact that public funds constituted between 90 and 99 percent of private school’s budget did not\nsatisfy under color of law requirement of 42 U.S.C. § 1983)\\ see also Blum v Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991 (1982);/acjt-\nson v Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U S 345, 350-53 (1974).\n\n                                                         195\n\f   While the Court’s recent decision in Bowen casts some doubt on the breadth\nor significance of the label “pervasively sectarian,”13 the Court has in the past\ndistinguished between those religious institutions that are “pervasively sectar­\nian” and those that are not.14Government assistance to a “pervasively sectarian”\nreligious institution has been generally thought to have the primary effect of ad­\nvancing religion, Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743 (1973), and therefore fail\nthe second prong of the Lemon test. However, as discussed above, not all reli­\ngious institutions are “pervasively sectarian,” and the Court has sustained direct\nfinancial assistance to church-affiliated organizations, provided the three-part\nLemon test is satisfied. Roemer v. Maryland Pub. Works Bd., 426 U.S. 736 (1976)\n(aid to church-affiliated college); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973) (same);\nTilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971) (same); Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U.S.\n291 (1899) (aid to hospital operated by religious order).\n   The seminal modem case on the permissibility of government assistance to re­\nligious institutions qua institutions is Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971).\nEarlier cases such as Everson v. Board ofEduc., 330 U.S. 1 (1947), and Board\nofEduc. v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236 (1968), had upheld the constitutionality of pub­\nlic assistance in the context of parochial schools on the theory that the aid went\nto the students, not to the schools themselves. “The State contributes no money\nto the schools. It does not support them. Its legislation, as applied, does no more\nthan provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of\ntheir religion, safely and expeditiously to and from accredited schools.” Everson\nv. Board ofEduc., 330 U.S. at 18. “[N]o funds or books are furnished to parochial\nschools, and the financial benefit is to parents and children, not to schools.” Board\nofEduc. v. Allen, 392 U.S. at 243-44. Tilton is the first modem case to permit\ndirect financial assistance to religious institutions.15\n   In Tilton the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of awarding construc­\ntion grants under the federal Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 to church-re-\nlated colleges and universities. The Act established a program, administered by the\nCommissioner of Education, to provide grants and loans to institutions of higher\neducation for the construction of academic facilities. The Act specifically excluded\n\n     13 See supra note 5\n     14 This Office has already repudiated any inference from the Olson Memorandum that organizations such as the\nSalvation Army, B ’nai B ’rith, and the Young Men’s Christian Association are “pervasively sectarian.” See Letter\nfor Stuart C.

I, 1986) (“Kmiec letter”), reprinted in\nHUD's Proposed Regulations Denying Funds to Religious Groups for Sheltering the Homeless Hearings Before\na Subcomm o f the House Comm, on Government Operations, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 111-12 (1987).\n     15 An intermediate case bridging the student benefit cases and the direct aid cases is Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397\nU.S 664 (1970) There the Court sustained the constitutionality of a property tax exemption for property owned by\nreligious organizations. Although a tax exemption is the economic equivalent of a subsidy, as die Court has rec­\nognized in other contexts, see Regan v. Taxation With Representation o f Washington, 461 US. 540, 544\n(1983)(“Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax sys­\ntem. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would\nhave to pay on its income.”), the Court in Walz clearly distinguished tax exemptions from subsidies for purposes\nof legal analysis “The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not transfer part of\nits revenue to churches but simply abstains from demanding that the church support the state.” 397 U.S at 675.\n\n                                                       196\n\ffrom eligibility for federal financing, however, “any facility used or to be used for\nsectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship.”\n   The Court found that the Act clearly had a legitimate secular purpose, namely\nencouraging and assisting colleges and universities to expand opportunities for\nhigher education. A more difficult question was whether the Act, despite its le­\ngitimate secular objective, nevertheless had the primary effect of advancing re­\nligion. The Court noted that “[T]he simplistic argument that every form of fi­\nnancial aid to church-sponsored activity violates the Religion Clauses was\nrejected long ago in Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U.S. 291 (1899).” Tilton v. Richard­\nson, 403 U.S. 672, 679 (1971). The Court then proceeded to examine the use of\nfederal assistance by the recipient institutions to determine whether the program\nhad the effect of advancing religion.\n   The Court found that the Act “was carefully drafted to ensure that the feder­\nally subsidized facilities would be devoted to the secular and not the religious\nfunction” of the grantee. Id. at 679. The colleges whose grants were before the\nCourt had scrupulously observed these restrictions and presented uncontradicted\nevidence that “there had been no religious services or worship in the federally fi­\nnanced facilities, that there are no religious symbols ... in or on them, and that\nthey had been used solely for nonreligious purposes.” Id. at 680. On this basis\nthe Court concluded that the federally funded buildings were “indistinguishable\nfrom a typical state university facility.” Id.\n   Moreover, the Court found that, unlike elementary and secondary parochial\nschools, religious indoctrination was not a substantial purpose or activity of\nchurch-related colleges. Id. at 680, 681. Accordingly, “there is less likelihood\nthan in primary and secondary schools that religion will permeate the area of sec­\nular education.” Id. at 687. That in turn “reduces the risk that government aid will\nin fact serve to support religious activities,” thereby diminishing the need for in­\ntensive government surveillance and reducing to an acceptable level the entan­\nglement between government and religion. Id.16 The Court therefore concluded\nthat the inclusion of church-related schools in the grant program did not violate\nthe Establishment Clause.\n   Hunt v. McNair and Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board involved similar\nprograms at the state level. At issue in Hunt was a South Carolina statute that pro­\nvided for the issuance of revenue bonds by a state authority to finance facilities at\ncolleges and universities. The Court rejected a facial challenge to the participation\nof church-related colleges in the program for the same reasons set forth in Tilton.\n   In Roemer the Court upheld the constitutionality of noncategorical grants to\nchurch-related colleges, so long as the grants were not used for sectarian pur­\nposes. Justice Blackmun’s plurality opinion in Roemer is perhaps the most force­\nful statement of the propriety of allowing religious organizations to participate\nin secular assistance programs. Recognizing the impossibility of any “hermetic\nseparation” between church and state, Justice Blackmun noted that “[i]t long has\n   16 The Court also found that the Act did not violate the Free Exercise nghts of taxpayers who objected to the\ngrants to church-related schools 403 U S at 689.\n\n                                                    197\n\fbeen established . . . that the State may send a cleric, indeed even a clerical or­\nder, to perform a wholly secular task.” Roemer v. Maryland Pub. Works Bd., 426\nU.S. 736, 746 (1976). The Court not only rejected the notion that “a religious\nperson can never be in the State’s pay for a secular purpose,” it suggested that\nexclusion because of religion would itself be unconstitutional. Id. at 746 & n.13.\nTilton, Hunt, and Roemer make it clear that a religious organization may partic­\nipate in public programs of a secular nature on the same basis as nonsectarian or­\nganizations. The determinative factor for Establishment Clause purposes is not\nthe religious nature of the facility’s owner but the uses to which the facility is\nput. So long as a facility is used for secular purposes, and is permanently dedi­\ncated to those purposes, the Constitution permits governmental aid, even though\nthe facility is owned by a religious institution. Roemer v. Maryland Pub. Works\nBd., 426 U.S. 736 (1976); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734 (1973); Tilton v. Richard­\nson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971); Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U.S. 291 (1899).17\n\n     17 HUD itself apparently now recognizes “the vital and unique role religious organizations play in providing for\nindividuals in need of shelter and other public assistance.” 52 Fed. Reg. 38,864, 38,868 (1987) In its recently pro­\nmulgated regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grants Program, HUD announced that federal funds can be used\nto renovate buildings owned by religious organizations if (1) the building or portion thereof that is to be improved\nwith HUD funds is leased to a wholly secular entity, (2) the HUD funds are provided solely to the secular lessee,\n(3) the leased premises are used exclusively for secular purposes and are available to all persons regardless of re­\nligion, (4) the lease payments do not exceed the fair market rent of the premises before the improvements are made,\n(5) the portion of the cost of any improvements that also serve non-leased areas of the building is allocated to and\npaid by the lessor, (6) the lessor agrees that, unless the lessee or another secular successor retain the leased premises\nfor wholly secular purposes for at least the useful life of the improvements, the lessor will pay to the lessee an\namount equal to the residual value of the improvements, and (7) the lessee permits any payments for the residual\nvalue of improvements to the State or local government agency that made the original grant, or to HUD in the case\nof a direct grant. 52 Fed. Reg. 38,864, 38,870 (1987) (to be codified at 24 C.F.R. § 575.21(b)(2)).\n        We believe that the leasing arrangement required by the regulations is not constitutionally necessary and\ntherefore should not be mandated by HUD. It is clear that religious organizations may participate on an equal foot­\ning with secular organizations in general assistance programs. The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed this prin­\nciple, noting that “this Court has never held that religious institutions are disabled by the First Amendment from\nparticipating m publicly sponsored social welfare programs.” Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 608 (1988). Leas­\ning arrangements under the terms specified in the HUD regulations might enhance the acceptability, however, of a\nreligious organization running a homeless shelter under the Emergency Shelter grant program within a highly sec­\ntarian structure like a church building. The leasing provisions might be prudentially retained, therefore, but with\nthe qualification that they apply only where a religious organization wishes to utilize space within a highly sectar­\nian building of this variety.\n       This is not to state that such leasing arrangements are constitutionally required even in this context. Given\nthe Court's newly-expressed preference to review Establishment Clause challenges on an as-applied, rather than\nfacial, basis, and the suggestion by even the dissenting members of the Court in Bowen v. Kendrick that “soup\nkitchen”-Uke functions are more tolerably supplied by religious organizations, it may be that the Court would sus­\ntain the operation of a publicly-funded emergency homeless shelter even, perhaps, in the Church proper, despite\nthe presence of permanently affixed religious symbols therein, provided the shelter was operated without religious\ncounseling or in a manner designed to inculcate the views of religious faith. The willingness of the Court to accept\nthe use of such a facility will likely depend, however, on the severity of the particular emergency housing need and\nthe willingness of the church to demonstrate clearly that only secular assistance will be provided. The point is sim­\nply that the Court has indicated that Establishment Clause principles ought not be applied in a sweeping, mechan­\nical fashion. Moreover, where a recipient of public funds has applied them in a manner inconsistent with the Clause,\n“an appropriate remedy would require the Secretary to withdraw [grant approval for that recipient].” 487 U S. at\n621\n       Despite the somewhat more generous attitude displayed by HUD’s shelter regulations, we are informed that\nHUD still requires grantees under both the Community Development Block Grant and Emergency Shelter Grant\nprograms to execute the special addendum to the grant agreement.\n                                                        198\n\fC. HUD’s Prohibitions on Religious Counseling and Religious Symbols\n   On its face, HUD’s prohibition on religious counseling and religious symbols\nwould not appear to be more restrictive than required by the Establishment Clause.\nThe Supreme Court’s Establishment Clause cases presuppose that government\nis providing secular assistance to be used for only secular purposes.\n   Although it is clear beyond peradventure that the government cannot subsi­\ndize religious counseling by the Salvation Army, there is nothing precluding HUD\nfrom subsidizing the Army’s secular program for the homeless (food and shel­\nter) if it can be meaningfully and reasonably separated from the Army’s sectar­\nian program (religious counseling). Constitutional difficulty only arises when the\nsecular component is inseparable from the sectarian component to permit gov­\nernment assistance.\n   Thus, as a constitutional matter the Salvation Army cannot undertake religious\ncounseling with public funds; however, it can accept public funds to provide food\nand shelter. If the facility used for the shelter program was not constructed, ren­\novated, or maintained with public funds, it is theoretically possible for a portion\nof the facility to be used exclusively for the publicly-funded secular purpose of\nfood and shelter and another portion to be used for the non-publicly funded sec­\ntarian purpose of religious counseling. Beyond this physical separation, HUD\nneed only ensure that the Army’s privately-funded religious activities are not of­\nfered as part of its shelter program and that the shelter program is not used as a\ndevice to involve the homeless in religious activities.18 Assuming these condi­\ntions were met, the Salvation Army could both participate in the CDBG or Emer­\ngency Shelter Grant programs and fulfill its religious mission using a single fa­\ncility.19\nD. Bowen v. Kendrick\n    The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 598\n(1988), upholding the participation of religious organizations in federally funded\ncounseling programs under the Adolescent Family Life Act, Pub. L. No. 97-35,\ntit. IX, 95 Stat. 578 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 300z to 300z-10), re­\nconfirms the analysis set forth above. Specifically, Kendrick makes it clear that\nreligious organizations may participate in government-funded social welfare pro­\ngrams so long as they engage in only purely secular activities. Kendrick thus sup­\n    18 The Court’s recent decision in Bowen v. Kendrick indicates that outside of the parochial school context the\nmonitoring necessary to ensure this separation will not entail excessive entanglement between church and state.\n487 U.S. at 615-16.\n    19 Moreover, we believe that HUD’s addendum on religious counseling may be construed to permit such use,\nbecause if religious counseling is kept completely separate from the publicly funded services it is not “connected”\nwith those services within the meaning of the addendum. Of course, if the facility was constructed, renovated, or\nmaintained with public funds, then no religious activities could be permitted therein. However, it may be permis­\nsible to use public funds to construct, renovate or maintain a separable portion of the facility that would be perma­\nnently and exclusively devoted to secular activities. HUD’s regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grant program\ncontemplate this possibility. See supra, note 17.\n\n                                                        199\n\fports our conclusion that the Salvation Army may receive federal funds for the\npurpose of sheltering the homeless.\n   At issue in Kendrick were grants awarded under the Adolescent Family Life Act\n(“AFLA”) to religious organizations for counseling teenagers in the areas of ado­\nlescent premarital sexual relations, pregnancy, and parenthood. The Court firmly\nrejected the claim that the mere participation of religious organizations as grantees\nunder AFLA was unconstitutional. Relying on a long line of cases upholding gov­\nernment assistance to religious organizations dating back to 1899, the Court dis­\navowed the notion that “religious institutions are disabled by the First Amendment\nfrom participating in publicly sponsored social welfare programs.” Bowen v.\nKendrick, 487 U.S. 589,609 (1988). So long as the assistance does not have the ef­\nfect of advancing religion, religious institutions may participate in general social\nwelfare programs on an equal footing with secular organizations.\n   The Court also disagreed with the claim that government funding of religious\norganizations in activities, even though otherwise purely secular, that involved\nfundamental matters of religious doctrine created a “symbolic link” between\nchurch and state that violated the Establishment Clause. Id. at 613. The Court\nnoted that acceptance of this argument would always preclude any aid to reli­\ngious organizations. Id. at 613.\n   Moreover, the Court squarely rejected the argument that funding such organi­\nzations under AFLA may lead to an “excessive government entanglement with\nreligion” and thus violate the third prong of the Lemon test. Id. at 615. Noting\nthat this prong of the Lemon test had been much criticized over the years, the\nCourt explained that cases that had found entanglement had involved aid to\nparochial schools, which were “pervasively sectarian” and had “as a substantial\npurpose the inculcation of religious values.” Id. at 616. In contrast, the Court\nnoted that there was no reason to assume that the religious organizations eligible\nfor AFLA funds are pervasively sectarian and thus no reason to fear that the kind\nof monitoring required will lead to excessive entanglement. Id.\n   The Court’s opinion in Kendrick thus stands for several important proposi­\ntions. First, it makes clear that religious organizations may fully participate in\ngovernment social programs even when these programs include moral teaching.\nA fortiori, religious organizations are eligible to participate in the provision of\ngovernment-subsidized care for the poor. Second, the Court’s opinion seems to\nsignal a relaxation of the entanglement prong of the Lemon test. Unless the in­\nstitutional context in which the religious organization operates is so pervasively\nsectarian as to be akin to a parochial school, the government will be permitted to\nmonitor religious organizations to assure that public money is spent in a consti­\ntutional manner.20\n   20 We believe that the Supreme Court’s conclusion with respect to excessive entanglement in Kendrick fatally\nundermines the Olson Memorandum’s argument that, in order to avoid excessive entanglement, religious organi­\nzations could participate in the section 202 program only through separate, nonreligious entities The memoran­\ndum reasoned that participation by religious organizations in the section 202 program would require a degree of\n“administrative oversight [that] would necessarily involve an excessive government entanglement with religion.”\nOlson Memorandum at 13.\n\n                                                   200\n\f   On the other hand, Kendrick did not address the degree to which and the means\nby which organizations must keep separate their religious activities from the ac­\ntivities funded by the government. Because the Supreme Court decided only the\nfacial validity of the statute, leaving the validity of the statute as applied to the\ndistrict court on remand, Kendrick provides little guidance on the issue of the de­\ngree of separation required between the government-funded secular activities and\nthe privately funded sectarian activities of a religious grantee. It is clear, how­\never, that at least some of the religious grantees did not maintain the constitu­\ntionally required separation between their religious mission and their secular\nfunction under AFLA. The Government’s brief in Kendrick conceded that there\nwere “departures from proper constitutional principles in individual AFLA pro­\ngrams,” Brief for the Appellant at 40, Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589 (1988),\nand the Court explicitly acknowledged that “the record contains evidence of spe­\ncific incidents of impermissible behavior by AFLA grantees.” 487 U.S. at 620.21\nAccordingly, Kendrick does not in any way establish that religious organizations\nmay use public funds in connection with promotion of religious views or prac­\ntices. The Supreme Court has ruled only that religious organizations may partic­\nipate on an equal basis in secular government assistance programs; Kendrick does\nnot suggest that the Court would be amenable to relaxing the degree to which\nthese organizations must separate their religious functions from their govern­\nment-funded secular activities.\n                                                    Conclusion\n   For the reasons set forth in this memorandum, we believe that HUD’s grant\nprohibitions on religious discrimination in employment and its limitation on\ngrants for rehabilitation, restoration or construction of facilities owned by reli­\ngious organizations but devoted to secular purposes are not required by the Con­\nstitution. We do not believe that HUD’s addendum prohibitions of religious coun­\nseling and religious symbols are more restrictive than the Establishment Clause\nrequires so long as they are reasonably applied. Finally, the prohibition relating\nto discrimination against program beneficiaries is consistent with constitutional\nand statutory requirements.\n                                                                            D o u g l a s W . K m ie c\n                                                                 Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                                                                      Office of Legal Counsel\n   20 (. . continued)\n         Kendrick is clearly to the contrary. If the Court rejected an excessive entanglement attack in the context of\na program such as AFLA, which involved counseling of adolescents on secular matters which frequently coincided\nwith religious values, a fortiori it would not sustain such an attack in the context of a program that provided non-\npedagogical assistance with no religious connotation, such as food, clothing, and shelter. For a disavowal of an ex­\npansive interpretation of the Olson Memorandum's concept of “pervasively sectarian,” see the Kmiec letter at note\n 15.\n     21 The district court had found that at least one grantee had included “spirituaJ counseling” as part of its services,\nthat numerous grantees conducted their programs in facilities adorned with religious symbols, and that several\ngrantees had presented privately funded religious counseling immediately after the government-funded AFLA coun­\nseling.

According to Mike Antonovich, Chairman of the\nBoard of Supervisors of Los Angeles County, these regulations are keeping the\nSalvation Army from obtaining a Community Development Block Grant to pro­\nvide emergency shelter and food to the homeless. In a memorandum (“Memo­\nrandum”) submitted to you last November, Frank Atkinson suggested that HUD’s\nban on religious counseling exceeds Establishment Clause requirements and may\ntransgress the Free Exercise Clause. The Memorandum therefore recommended\nthat the Legal and Regulatory Policy Working Group develop an administration\npolicy to enable religious organizations to participate in the delivery of govern­\nment-assisted social services to the maximum extent permissible under the First\nAmendment.\n   The restrictions to which the Salvation Army objects are generally not em­\nbodied in formal rules, but rather are contained in an addendum that HUD re­\nquires as part of its grant agreement with religious organizations. The addendum\nstates that the grantee agrees (1) not to discriminate against any employee or ap­\nplicant for employment on the basis of religion in connection with the program\n                                                     190\n\freceiving the grant,1(2) not to discriminate on the basis of religion in the provi­\nsion of funded services, (3) not to provide any religious instruction or counsel­\ning in connection with the program2, and (4) not to display any sectarian or reli­\ngious symbols or decorations in any portion of the facility used to conduct the\nprogram. The addendum further provides that no federal funds may be used to\nconstruct, rehabilitate, or restore any facility owned by a religious organization,\nexcept that “minor repairs” that are directly related to the provision of public ser­\nvices and that constitute in dollar terms only a minor portion of the federal grant\nmay be made to a facility used exclusively for non-religious purposes.\n   For the reasons stated below, we believe that HUD’s addendum interferes with\nreligious organizations’ ability to participate in the CDBG program in several re­\nspects not mandated by the Establishment Clause. First, we believe neither the\nConstitution nor the applicable statutes require religious organizations to refrain\nfrom discrimination on the basis of religion in employment as a condition of their\nreceipt of funds under the Community Development Block Grant program. We\nalso believe that the restriction on the use of federal funds to construct, rehabil­\nitate, or restore facilities owned by religious organizations is more severe than\ncurrent jurisprudence under the Establishment Clause requires. So long as reli­\ngious organizations agree to dedicate facilities constructed, rehabilitated or\nrestored with federal funds to secular purposes in perpetuity, the strictures man­\ndated by Establishment Clause jurisprudence are satisfied. Finally, the prohibi­\ntions of religious instruction or counseling and religious symbols are acceptable\nso long as they are reasonably interpreted in light of the facts of each case. See\ninfra note 17 and accompanying text.\n   After analyzing these restrictions under current Establishment Clause ju­\nrisprudence we review the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Bowen v.

Reg. 43,852, 43,899 (1984) (to be codified at 24 C F.R. § 570.904(a)) (proposed Oct. 31, 1984).\n    2 The HUD addendum provides that the grantee “agrees that, in connection with such public services!,] . . . it\nwill provide no religious instruction or counseling, conduct no religious worship or services, engage in no religious\nproselytizing, and exert no other religious influence in the provision of such public services.*'\n\n                                                        191\n\fan Establishment Clause challenge an exemption from title VII’s ban on religious\ndiscrimination in employment for “a religious corporation, association, educa­\ntional institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a\nparticular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such cor­\nporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities.” Id. at\n330 n. 1. Specifically, the Court held that exemption satisfied the three-part test\nset out in Lemon v. Kurtzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), for determining whether gov­\nernment assistance to religion is permissible under the Establishment Clause. The\nCourt held that the law passed muster under the first prong of the Lemon test,\nwhich requires that legislation serve a secular purpose, because its purpose was\nto limit governmental interference with the exercise of religion. Id. at 335-36.\nThe Court held that the exemption did not have the primary purpose of advanc­\ning religion, and thus passed the second prong of the Lemon test, because it did\nnot increase the capacity of religious institutions to propagate their religion be­\nyond that which the institutions possessed prior to enactment of title VII.

Finally, the Court concluded that the statute did not impermissibly entangle\nchurch and state, the third prong of the Lemon test, because it effected a com­\nplete separation between churches and title VII. Id. at 339.\n   Amos establishes that the Constitution permits an exemption for religious or­\nganizations from an otherwise generally applicable prohibition on religious dis­\ncrimination in employment and therefore suggests that HUD is not constitution­\nally obligated to require grantees to refrain from religious discrimination in hiring.\nAmos, however, does not conclusively resolve the issue of whether HUD’s reg­\nulation prohibiting religious discrimination in employment is required by the Es­\ntablishment Clause, because Amos does not address whether an organization that\npractices religious discrimination in employment is a “pervasively sectarian” in­\nstitution and therefore more likely to be ineligible to receive government finan­\ncial assistance under current Supreme Court caselaw.3 Although we have found\n\n     3 We do not believe that Amos itself implies that there is an identity between the class of institutions that are\ncharacterized as “pervasively sectarian” under the Establishment Clause and those that qualify for the exemption.\nThe exemption at issue in Amos applied to “a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society\nwith respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the canying\non by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities ” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-l. Noth­\ning in the language of the statute suggests that the exemption is available only to those religious organizations that\nare characterized “pervasively sectarian\" as a matter of constitutional jurisprudence. See, e.g., Hunt v McNair, 4 13\nU S 734, 743 (1973) (referring to “pervasively sectarian” institutions as those “in which religion is so pervasive\nthat a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission”). Indeed, since the only institutions\nthat have actually been held to be “pervasively sectarian” are parochial schools, equating “religious” with “perva­\nsively sectarian” would appear substantially to narrow the scope of the exemption.\n        The facts of the Amos case itself indicate that the exemption is available to religious organizations that are\nnot “pervasively sectarian.” The individual whose case was before the Supreme Court was employed as a building\nengineer at the Deseret Gymnasium, a non-profit facility operated by the Mormon Church 183 U S. at 330. The\ndistrict court had specifically found that “there is nothing in the running or purpose of Deseret that suggests that it\nwas intended to spread or teach the religious beliefs and doctrine and practices of sacred ritual of the Mormon\nChurch or that it was intended to be an integral part of church administration. Rather, its primary function is to pro­\nvide facilities for physical exercise and athletic games.

Courts have generally\nfound that church-related elementary and secondary schools are “pervasively sec­\ntarian,” while most post-secondary institutions have been deemed sufficiently\nsecular to permit government assistance. In making these determinations, courts\nhave looked at a variety of factors, including the degree of control by religious\norganizations, whether the school or its curriculum has the purpose of teaching\nand promoting a particular religious faith, whether there are religious restrictions\non admission to the school, whether there are required courses in theology or re­\nligious doctrine, whether participation in religious exercises is required, and\nwhether the school is an integral part of the sponsoring organization’s religious\nmission.5 In particular, two appellate courts have considered restrictions or pref­\n\n\n\n    3 ( ... continued)\n(D.

Based on the evidence adduced by the Supreme Court, the Deseret Gymnasium does not appear to be a “per­\nvasively sectarian” institution under Establishment Clause jurisprudence\n    4 In addition to the lack of a precise definition of “pervasively sectarian” institution, members of the Court dif­\nfer with respect to the significance of such a determination For example, Justice Kennedy, in his concurring opin­\nion in Bowen for himself and Justice Scalia, indicates some skepticism about the utility of the “pervasively sectar­\nian” concept. “The question in an as-applied challenge is not whether the entity is of a religious character, but how\nit spends its grant.” 487 U.S. at 624-25. The separate concurrence of Justice O’Connor as well suggests that the\nproper inquiry is whether any public funds have been used to promote religion 487 U.S. at 622. Even Justices\nBlackmun, Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens in dissent in Bowen indicated that “the Constitution does not prohibit\nthe government from supporting secular social-welfare services solely because they are provided by a religiously\naffiliated organization ” 487 U.S. at 640 Significantly for the matter under review, the dissent stated “[t]here is a\nvery real and important difference between running a soup kitchen or a hospital, and counseling pregnant teenagers ”\nId. at 641. Thus, the dissent suggests the importance of evaluating the substantive nature of the use of public funds.\nConfusingly, the dissent also indicated that the label “pervasively sectarian” may serve in some cases as a proxy\nfor a more detailed analysis of the institution, the nature of the aid, and the manner in which the aid may be used.\nId at 633, see also Roemer v Maryland Pub.

Moreover, even those members of the Court more apt to find an in­\nstitution to be pervasively sectarian have indicated that the Establishment Clause\nposes fewer obstacles to the involvement of religious organizations when the ac­\ntivity is not aimed at the “shaping [of] belief and changing behavior,” but “neu­\ntrally dispensing medication, food or shelter.”7 We therefore believe that the few\ncases ascribing significance to discrimination in hiring by parochial schools in\ndetermining whether such schools are “pervasively sectarian” are of limited rel­\nevance when applied to the subject under review.8\n   Nor does any statute require HUD to prohibit CDBG grantees from limiting\nemployment opportunities on the basis of religion.

Olson, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (July 1, 1983) (“Olson Memorandum”)\nwhich stated that “[A]n institution that grants preferences to members of a particular creed would by definition be\na pervasively sectarian organization,” Olson Memorandum at 19, is not to the contrary. That comment was made\nin the context of religious discrimination among potential beneficiaries of government-funded social service pro­\ngrams. While that comment may at some point require re-examination, we need not here reach the constitutional\nissue of whether discrimination among beneficianes makes an institution “pervasively sectarian,” because, as dis­\ncussed below, the statute creating the CDBG program prohibits religious discrimination in the provision of ser­\nvices. See infra note 10.\n    9 Section 109 of the 1974 Act (42 U.S.C. § 5309) provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall on the\nground of race, color, national origin, or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub­\njected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under\nthis chapter,” but does not forbid religious discnmination Section 104(b)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C § 5304(b)(2))\nfurther requires grantees to certify that their grants “will be conducted and administered in conformity with Public\nLaw 88-352 and Public Law 90-284 ” Public Law No. 88-352 is the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat 241 (cod­\nified as amended at 28 U S.C. § 1447, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971, 1975a-1975d, 2000a-2000h-6), and Public Law No.\n90-284 is the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 73 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C., 42\nU.S C , 25 U.S.C. §§ 1301 -1341, 28 U.S.C. § 1360 note). No provision of the latter act relates to discrimination in\nemployment.\n\n                                                         194\n\fover, although title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 contains a general prohi­\nbition of discrimination in federally assisted programs on the ground of race,\ncolor, or national origin, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, religious discrimination is not pro­\nhibited.10\n   The only other arguably relevant provision of the 1964 Act is title II, the pub­\nlic accommodations provision, which provides that “[a]ll persons shall be enti­\ntled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as de­\nfined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a). Although barring reli­\ngious discrimination by places of public accommodation, this section does not\napply to the employment practices of such establishments but only to their pro­\nvision of services. Accordingly, it appears that the Housing and Community De­\nvelopment Act of 1974, whose certification provision incorporates by reference\nthe Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, does not require religious organizations\nto refrain from religious discrimination in employment in connection with ac­\ntivities funded under the Act.11\n   We therefore conclude that the Constitution not only permits the granting of\nan exemption to religious organizations from otherwise applicable prohibitions\non religious discrimination in employment, but also that it permits government\nfinancial assistance to the organizations so exempted.12The act creating the block\ngrant program does not require a prohibition on religious discrimination in hir­\ning. Since HUD’s regulations flatly prohibit this form of religious discrimination\nby grantees, they are more restrictive than required by law.\nB. HUD’s Restrictions Prohibiting Rehabilitation, Restoration and\nConstruction Funds for Religious Organizations\n   The HUD regulations that prohibit use of federal funds to construct, rehabili­\ntate, or restore any facility that is owned by a religious organization are also more\nrestrictive than is constitutionally required. It is clear that there is no per se ex­\nclusion of religious institutions from the receipt of government aid under certain\ncircumstances.

Title II of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, as indicated in the text, prohibits religious discrimination in places of public accommodation.\nShelters appear to be places of public accommodation under the statute, since they constitute an “inn, hotel, motel,\nor other establishment which provides lodging to transient guests.” 42 U S.C. § 2000a(b)( I). Other types of social\nservice facilities may or may not fail under the statutory definition of places of public accommodation.\n    12 It is also clear that mere receipt of government financial assistance will not transform the religious organiza­\ntion into a state actor subject to constitutional prohibitions on religious discnmination.

Tilton is the first modem case to permit\ndirect financial assistance to religious institutions.15\n   In Tilton the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of awarding construc­\ntion grants under the federal Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 to church-re-\nlated colleges and universities.

Tax Comm'n, 397\nU.S 664 (1970) There the Court sustained the constitutionality of a property tax exemption for property owned by\nreligious organizations. Although a tax exemption is the economic equivalent of a subsidy, as die Court has rec­\nognized in other contexts, see Regan v. Taxation With Representation o f Washington, 461 US. 540, 544\n(1983)(“Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax sys­\ntem. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would\nhave to pay on its income.”), the Court in Walz clearly distinguished tax exemptions from subsidies for purposes\nof legal analysis “The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not transfer part of\nits revenue to churches but simply abstains from demanding that the church support the state.” 397 U.S at 675.\n\n                                                       196\n\ffrom eligibility for federal financing, however, “any facility used or to be used for\nsectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship.”\n   The Court found that the Act clearly had a legitimate secular purpose, namely\nencouraging and assisting colleges and universities to expand opportunities for\nhigher education. A more difficult question was whether the Act, despite its le­\ngitimate secular objective, nevertheless had the primary effect of advancing re­\nligion. The Court noted that “[T]he simplistic argument that every form of fi­\nnancial aid to church-sponsored activity violates the Religion Clauses was\nrejected long ago in Bradfield v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95124\"><a href=\"/opinion/95124/bradfield-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1899).” Tilton v.

The Court then proceeded to examine the use of\nfederal assistance by the recipient institutions to determine whether the program\nhad the effect of advancing religion.\n   The Court found that the Act “was carefully drafted to ensure that the feder­\nally subsidized facilities would be devoted to the secular and not the religious\nfunction” of the grantee. Id. at 679. The colleges whose grants were before the\nCourt had scrupulously observed these restrictions and presented uncontradicted\nevidence that “there had been no religious services or worship in the federally fi­\nnanced facilities, that there are no religious symbols ... in or on them, and that\nthey had been used solely for nonreligious purposes.” Id. at 680. On this basis\nthe Court concluded that the federally funded buildings were “indistinguishable\nfrom a typical state university facility.” Id.\n   Moreover, the Court found that, unlike elementary and secondary parochial\nschools, religious indoctrination was not a substantial purpose or activity of\nchurch-related colleges. Id. at 680, 681. Accordingly, “there is less likelihood\nthan in primary and secondary schools that religion will permeate the area of sec­\nular education.” Id. at 687. That in turn “reduces the risk that government aid will\nin fact serve to support religious activities,” thereby diminishing the need for in­\ntensive government surveillance and reducing to an acceptable level the entan­\nglement between government and religion. Id.16 The Court therefore concluded\nthat the inclusion of church-related schools in the grant program did not violate\nthe Establishment Clause.\n   Hunt v. McNair and Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board involved similar\nprograms at the state level. At issue in Hunt was a South Carolina statute that pro­\nvided for the issuance of revenue bonds by a state authority to finance facilities at\ncolleges and universities. The Court rejected a facial challenge to the participation\nof church-related colleges in the program for the same reasons set forth in Tilton.\n   In Roemer the Court upheld the constitutionality of noncategorical grants to\nchurch-related colleges, so long as the grants were not used for sectarian pur­\nposes. Justice Blackmun’s plurality opinion in Roemer is perhaps the most force­\nful statement of the propriety of allowing religious organizations to participate\nin secular assistance programs. Recognizing the impossibility of any “hermetic\nseparation” between church and state, Justice Blackmun noted that “[i]t long has\n   16 The Court also found that the Act did not violate the Free Exercise nghts of taxpayers who objected to the\ngrants to church-related schools 403 U S at 689.\n\n                                                    197\n\fbeen established . . . that the State may send a cleric, indeed even a clerical or­\nder, to perform a wholly secular task.” Roemer v.

Id. at 746 & n.13.\nTilton, Hunt, and Roemer make it clear that a religious organization may partic­\nipate in public programs of a secular nature on the same basis as nonsectarian or­\nganizations. The determinative factor for Establishment Clause purposes is not\nthe religious nature of the facility’s owner but the uses to which the facility is\nput. So long as a facility is used for secular purposes, and is permanently dedi­\ncated to those purposes, the Constitution permits governmental aid, even though\nthe facility is owned by a religious institution.

Reg. 38,864, 38,868 (1987) In its recently pro­\nmulgated regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grants Program, HUD announced that federal funds can be used\nto renovate buildings owned by religious organizations if (1) the building or portion thereof that is to be improved\nwith HUD funds is leased to a wholly secular entity, (2) the HUD funds are provided solely to the secular lessee,\n(3) the leased premises are used exclusively for secular purposes and are available to all persons regardless of re­\nligion, (4) the lease payments do not exceed the fair market rent of the premises before the improvements are made,\n(5) the portion of the cost of any improvements that also serve non-leased areas of the building is allocated to and\npaid by the lessor, (6) the lessor agrees that, unless the lessee or another secular successor retain the leased premises\nfor wholly secular purposes for at least the useful life of the improvements, the lessor will pay to the lessee an\namount equal to the residual value of the improvements, and (7) the lessee permits any payments for the residual\nvalue of improvements to the State or local government agency that made the original grant, or to HUD in the case\nof a direct grant. 52 Fed. Reg. 38,864, 38,870 (1987) (to be codified at 24 C.F.R. § 575.21(b)(2)).\n        We believe that the leasing arrangement required by the regulations is not constitutionally necessary and\ntherefore should not be mandated by HUD. It is clear that religious organizations may participate on an equal foot­\ning with secular organizations in general assistance programs. The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed this prin­\nciple, noting that “this Court has never held that religious institutions are disabled by the First Amendment from\nparticipating m publicly sponsored social welfare programs.” Bowen v. Kendrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (1988). Leas­\ning arrangements under the terms specified in the HUD regulations might enhance the acceptability, however, of a\nreligious organization running a homeless shelter under the Emergency Shelter grant program within a highly sec­\ntarian structure like a church building. The leasing provisions might be prudentially retained, therefore, but with\nthe qualification that they apply only where a religious organization wishes to utilize space within a highly sectar­\nian building of this variety.\n       This is not to state that such leasing arrangements are constitutionally required even in this context. Given\nthe Court's newly-expressed preference to review Establishment Clause challenges on an as-applied, rather than\nfacial, basis, and the suggestion by even the dissenting members of the Court in Bowen v. Kendrick that “soup\nkitchen”-Uke functions are more tolerably supplied by religious organizations, it may be that the Court would sus­\ntain the operation of a publicly-funded emergency homeless shelter even, perhaps, in the Church proper, despite\nthe presence of permanently affixed religious symbols therein, provided the shelter was operated without religious\ncounseling or in a manner designed to inculcate the views of religious faith. The willingness of the Court to accept\nthe use of such a facility will likely depend, however, on the severity of the particular emergency housing need and\nthe willingness of the church to demonstrate clearly that only secular assistance will be provided. The point is sim­\nply that the Court has indicated that Establishment Clause principles ought not be applied in a sweeping, mechan­\nical fashion. Moreover, where a recipient of public funds has applied them in a manner inconsistent with the Clause,\n“an appropriate remedy would require the Secretary to withdraw [grant approval for that recipient].” 487 U S. at\n621\n       Despite the somewhat more generous attitude displayed by HUD’s shelter regulations, we are informed that\nHUD still requires grantees under both the Community Development Block Grant and Emergency Shelter Grant\nprograms to execute the special addendum to the grant agreement.\n                                                        198\n\fC. HUD’s Prohibitions on Religious Counseling and Religious Symbols\n   On its face, HUD’s prohibition on religious counseling and religious symbols\nwould not appear to be more restrictive than required by the Establishment Clause.\nThe Supreme Court’s Establishment Clause cases presuppose that government\nis providing secular assistance to be used for only secular purposes.\n   Although it is clear beyond peradventure that the government cannot subsi­\ndize religious counseling by the Salvation Army, there is nothing precluding HUD\nfrom subsidizing the Army’s secular program for the homeless (food and shel­\nter) if it can be meaningfully and reasonably separated from the Army’s sectar­\nian program (religious counseling). Constitutional difficulty only arises when the\nsecular component is inseparable from the sectarian component to permit gov­\nernment assistance.\n   Thus, as a constitutional matter the Salvation Army cannot undertake religious\ncounseling with public funds; however, it can accept public funds to provide food\nand shelter. If the facility used for the shelter program was not constructed, ren­\novated, or maintained with public funds, it is theoretically possible for a portion\nof the facility to be used exclusively for the publicly-funded secular purpose of\nfood and shelter and another portion to be used for the non-publicly funded sec­\ntarian purpose of religious counseling. Beyond this physical separation, HUD\nneed only ensure that the Army’s privately-funded religious activities are not of­\nfered as part of its shelter program and that the shelter program is not used as a\ndevice to involve the homeless in religious activities.18 Assuming these condi­\ntions were met, the Salvation Army could both participate in the CDBG or Emer­\ngency Shelter Grant programs and fulfill its religious mission using a single fa­\ncility.19\nD. Bowen v. Kendrick\n    The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Bowen v. Kendrick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1988), upholding the participation of religious organizations in federally funded\ncounseling programs under the Adolescent Family Life Act, Pub. L. No. 97-35,\ntit. IX, 95 Stat. 578 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 300z to 300z-10), re­\nconfirms the analysis set forth above. Specifically, Kendrick makes it clear that\nreligious organizations may participate in government-funded social welfare pro­\ngrams so long as they engage in only purely secular activities. Kendrick thus sup­\n    18 The Court’s recent decision in Bowen v. Kendrick indicates that outside of the parochial school context the\nmonitoring necessary to ensure this separation will not entail excessive entanglement between church and state.\n487 U.S. at 615-16.\n    19 Moreover, we believe that HUD’s addendum on religious counseling may be construed to permit such use,\nbecause if religious counseling is kept completely separate from the publicly funded services it is not “connected”\nwith those services within the meaning of the addendum. Of course, if the facility was constructed, renovated, or\nmaintained with public funds, then no religious activities could be permitted therein. However, it may be permis­\nsible to use public funds to construct, renovate or maintain a separable portion of the facility that would be perma­\nnently and exclusively devoted to secular activities. HUD’s regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grant program\ncontemplate this possibility. See supra, note 17.\n\n                                                        199\n\fports our conclusion that the Salvation Army may receive federal funds for the\npurpose of sheltering the homeless.\n   At issue in Kendrick were grants awarded under the Adolescent Family Life Act\n(“AFLA”) to religious organizations for counseling teenagers in the areas of ado­\nlescent premarital sexual relations, pregnancy, and parenthood. The Court firmly\nrejected the claim that the mere participation of religious organizations as grantees\nunder AFLA was unconstitutional. Relying on a long line of cases upholding gov­\nernment assistance to religious organizations dating back to 1899, the Court dis­\navowed the notion that “religious institutions are disabled by the First Amendment\nfrom participating in publicly sponsored social welfare programs.” Bowen v.\nKendrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,609 (1988). So long as the assistance does not have the ef­\nfect of advancing religion, religious institutions may participate in general social\nwelfare programs on an equal footing with secular organizations.\n   The Court also disagreed with the claim that government funding of religious\norganizations in activities, even though otherwise purely secular, that involved\nfundamental matters of religious doctrine created a “symbolic link” between\nchurch and state that violated the Establishment Clause. Id. at 613. The Court\nnoted that acceptance of this argument would always preclude any aid to reli­\ngious organizations. Id. at 613.\n   Moreover, the Court squarely rejected the argument that funding such organi­\nzations under AFLA may lead to an “excessive government entanglement with\nreligion” and thus violate the third prong of the Lemon test. Id. at 615. Noting\nthat this prong of the Lemon test had been much criticized over the years, the\nCourt explained that cases that had found entanglement had involved aid to\nparochial schools, which were “pervasively sectarian” and had “as a substantial\npurpose the inculcation of religious values.” Id. at 616. In contrast, the Court\nnoted that there was no reason to assume that the religious organizations eligible\nfor AFLA funds are pervasively sectarian and thus no reason to fear that the kind\nof monitoring required will lead to excessive entanglement. Id.\n   The Court’s opinion in Kendrick thus stands for several important proposi­\ntions. First, it makes clear that religious organizations may fully participate in\ngovernment social programs even when these programs include moral teaching.\nA fortiori, religious organizations are eligible to participate in the provision of\ngovernment-subsidized care for the poor. Second, the Court’s opinion seems to\nsignal a relaxation of the entanglement prong of the Lemon test. Unless the in­\nstitutional context in which the religious organization operates is so pervasively\nsectarian as to be akin to a parochial school, the government will be permitted to\nmonitor religious organizations to assure that public money is spent in a consti­\ntutional manner.20\n   20 We believe that the Supreme Court’s conclusion with respect to excessive entanglement in Kendrick fatally\nundermines the Olson Memorandum’s argument that, in order to avoid excessive entanglement, religious organi­\nzations could participate in the section 202 program only through separate, nonreligious entities The memoran­\ndum reasoned that participation by religious organizations in the section 202 program would require a degree of\n“administrative oversight [that] would necessarily involve an excessive government entanglement with religion.”\nOlson Memorandum at 13.\n\n                                                   200\n\f   On the other hand, Kendrick did not address the degree to which and the means\nby which organizations must keep separate their religious activities from the ac­\ntivities funded by the government. Because the Supreme Court decided only the\nfacial validity of the statute, leaving the validity of the statute as applied to the\ndistrict court on remand, Kendrick provides little guidance on the issue of the de­\ngree of separation required between the government-funded secular activities and\nthe privately funded sectarian activities of a religious grantee. It is clear, how­\never, that at least some of the religious grantees did not maintain the constitu­\ntionally required separation between their religious mission and their secular\nfunction under AFLA. The Government’s brief in Kendrick conceded that there\nwere “departures from proper constitutional principles in individual AFLA pro­\ngrams,” Brief for the Appellant at 40, Bowen v. Kendrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988),\nand the Court explicitly acknowledged that “the record contains evidence of spe­\ncific incidents of impermissible behavior by AFLA grantees.” 487 U.S. at 620.21\nAccordingly, Kendrick does not in any way establish that religious organizations\nmay use public funds in connection with promotion of religious views or prac­\ntices. The Supreme Court has ruled only that religious organizations may partic­\nipate on an equal basis in secular government assistance programs; Kendrick does\nnot suggest that the Court would be amenable to relaxing the degree to which\nthese organizations must separate their religious functions from their govern­\nment-funded secular activities.\n                                                    Conclusion\n   For the reasons set forth in this memorandum, we believe that HUD’s grant\nprohibitions on religious discrimination in employment and its limitation on\ngrants for rehabilitation, restoration or construction of facilities owned by reli­\ngious organizations but devoted to secular purposes are not required by the Con­\nstitution. We do not believe that HUD’s addendum prohibitions of religious coun­\nseling and religious symbols are more restrictive than the Establishment Clause\nrequires so long as they are reasonably applied. Finally, the prohibition relating\nto discrimination against program beneficiaries is consistent with constitutional\nand statutory requirements.\n                                                                            D o u g l a s W . K m ie c\n                                                                 Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                                                                      Office of Legal Counsel\n   20 (. . continued)\n         Kendrick is clearly to the contrary. If the Court rejected an excessive entanglement attack in the context of\na program such as AFLA, which involved counseling of adolescents on secular matters which frequently coincided\nwith religious values, a fortiori it would not sustain such an attack in the context of a program that provided non-\npedagogical assistance with no religious connotation, such as food, clothing, and shelter. For a disavowal of an ex­\npansive interpretation of the Olson Memorandum's concept of “pervasively sectarian,” see the Kmiec letter at note\n 15.\n     21 The district court had found that at least one grantee had included “spirituaJ counseling” as part of its services,\nthat numerous grantees conducted their programs in facilities adorned with religious symbols, and that several\ngrantees had presented privately funded religious counseling immediately after the government-funded AFLA coun­\nseling.
