CR 1-4. Appellant filed his Original Answer on\n\nOctober 5, 2012. CR 6-7. Appellant filed his First Amended Answer on October\n\n24, 2012. CR 8-9. On June 5, 2013, Appellant filed his Second Amended Answer\n\nand Petition to Joinder Third Party, joining Appellee Adria Simcoe, his ex-wife, as\n\na third-party defendant. CR 15-17. On August 16, 2013, Appellant filed his Second\n\nAmended Answer and First Amended Petition to Join Third Party Defendant. CR\n\n19-21. On February 11, 2014, Appellant filed his Third Amended Answer and\n\nSecond Amended Petition to Join Third Party Defendant.                      CR 23-25.       The\n\nChristophers filed their Second Amended Petition for Breach of Oral Contract and\n\nFor Promissory Estoppel on February 20, 2014. CR 26-30.\n\n       The final hearing of this matter was held on February 24, 2014, which\n\nincluded Appellant’s motion to dismiss on the basis of the statute of frauds. CR 31.\n\nThe judgment was signed on July 9, 2014. CR 36-37.\n\n       Appellant timely filed a Motion for New Trial on August 7, 2014, and a First\n\nAmended Motion for New Trial on September 9, 2014. CR 40-82; CR 83-129. The\n\n\n1\n In this Brief, the Clerk’s Record is cited as “CR,” and the Reporter’s Record from the hearing\non February 24, 2014 is cited as “RR.”\n\n                                                6\n\fMotion for New Trial was denied after hearing on September 25, 2014. CR 130-\n\n131. Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 21, 2014. CR 132-134.\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      In the summer of 2012, the Christophers’ daughter, Adria Simcoe, was\n\nexpecting her fourth child with her then-husband, Brian Simcoe.          RR 43:13.\n\nDesiring to help the Simcoe family, it is undisputed that the Christophers purchased\n\na 2010 Chrysler Town and Country (hereafter “the Van”) and a Jeep, intending for\n\nthese vehicles to be used by the growing Simcoe family. RR 37:11-15; 43:19-25. It\n\nis undisputed that at the time the Van was purchased by the Christophers, the\n\nSimcoes’ credit score precluded them from acquiring financing for the Van in their\n\nown names. RR 12:23-25; 13:1-4. It is undisputed that the Christophers signed a\n\nfive-year note for the Van. RR 21:9-13. It is undisputed while the Van was in the\n\npossession of the Simcoes, the Simcoes made the monthly payments for the Van.\n\nRR 14:24-25; 15:1-5.\n\n      On February 21, 2012, Adria Simcoe filed for divorce. RR 51:15-20. Shortly\n\nthereafter, Appellant returned the Van to the Christophers with a kind note\n\nexplaining that, in light of the pending divorce, he was no longer able to afford the\n\nmonthly payments. RR 16:6-13; 52:4-5. The Christophers had the Van repossessed\n\nabout one month later. RR 17:21-24. The Van was sold at auction, leaving a\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fdeficiency of $18,411.14, for which the Christophers were the named responsible\n\nparties. RR 19:7-15.\n\n      The Simcoes’ Final Decree of Divorce was signed on November 5, 2013. RR\n\n40:21-22. Nowhere in the decree is the Van mentioned as an asset or a liability of\n\nthe marital estate. CR 113-114; RR 80:21-25; 81:1-5. The Jeep was awarded to\n\nAdria Simcoe. CR 113-114.\n\n      On September 20, 2012, the Christophers filed suit against Appellant, alleging\n\nthat he breached an oral contract whereby the Christophers were to obtain the Van\n\nin their names and Appellant was to be responsible for all payments thereon. CR 1-\n\n4. The Christophers sought to hold Appellant responsible for the entire amount of\n\nthe deficiency. Id. Appellant brought his ex-wife, Adria Simcoe, into the suit as a\n\nthird-party defendant, maintaining that if he was liable, she shared joint and several\n\nliability with him as a responsible party to the alleged oral contract. CR 23-25.\n\n      At the final hearing on February 24, 2014, the Christophers alleged that the\n\nSimcoes were obligated to make the monthly payments for the Van, regardless of\n\nwhether or not the Simcoes had possession of it. Compare RR 11:24-25; 12:1-2; RR\n\n34:25; 35:1-4, with RR 60:18-22; RR 70:6-12. The Christophers further alleged that\n\nthey agreed to acquire the Van in their names, but that the Simcoes were obligated\n\nto make all payments under the five year note or to refinance the vehicle into their\n\nnames once their credit so permitted. RR 20:17-18; RR 24:13-19; RR 28:10-19.\n\n\n                                          8\n\fConversely, Appellant maintained that the Simcoes agreed only to make payments\n\nfor the Van for so long as they had possession of it. RR 60:18-22; RR 70:6-12. In\n\nother words, according to Appellant, by returning the Van to the Christophers, the\n\nSimcoes’ obligation to make payments ceased. RR 71:16-20. Appellant further\n\nargued that the time for performance, based upon the five-year note signed by the\n\nChristophers, was greater than one year. RR 67:22-25; 68:1-3. As such, the statute\n\nof frauds barred enforcement of the oral agreement because it was not in writing nor\n\nwas it signed by the parties to be bound.       RR 84:2-8.\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that the alleged oral\n\ncontract was taken outside of the statute of frauds “by virtue of the fact that [the Van]\n\ncould have been refinanced as the plan was to refinance as soon as Mr. Simcoe’s\n\ncredit improved.” RR at 85:17-21. Judgment was rendered against Appellant for\n\n$18,411.14, and an additional $5,000.00 was awarded to the Christophers for their\n\nattorney’s fees. RR 86:2-4: CR 36-37. No judgment was rendered against Appellee\n\nAdria Simcoe. RR 86:5-15; CR 36-37.\n\n      Appellant timely filed a Motion for New Trial, and a hearing on said Motion\n\nwas held on September 11, 2014. CR 83-88. Appellant requested a new trial on the\n\ngrounds that there was no evidence the alleged oral agreement could be performed\n\nor was intended to be performed within one year, and because Adria Simcoe\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fshould’ve been held jointly and severally liable.   Id. The trial court denied\n\nAppellant’s Motion for New Trial and this appeal followed. CR 131-134.\n\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\f                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n I.   Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s finding\n\n      that enforcement of the oral agreement was not barred by the statute of frauds.\n\n\nII.   Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s judgment\n\n      solely against Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS\n\n      To be enforceable, the statute of frauds requires that a contract to answer for\n\nthe debt of another, like the one at issue in this case, be in writing and signed by the\n\nparty to be bound. It is undisputed that there was not a written and signed contract\n\nbetween the Simcoes and the Christophers for the debt at issue. The statute of frauds\n\ntherefore barred enforceability of the alleged oral contract as a matter of law.\n\n      Performance of the alleged oral contract, whether by payment in full or\n\nrefinancing of the debt, was not to be completed within one year, according to the\n\ntenor of the agreement and the understanding of the parties at the time the agreement\n\nwas allegedly made. Performance within one year could only have been possible\n\nupon the occurrence of some merely fortuitous event. The evidence was legally\n\ninsufficient to support the trial court’s finding that the oral contract was enforceable\n\nbecause of the One-Year Exception to the statute of frauds.\n\n      The undisputed evidence shows that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were\n\nparties to the oral contract at issue as promisors. The terms of the oral contract did\n\nnot differentiate or apportion liability between Appellant and Adria Simcoe.\n\nAccordingly, the only theory of liability supported by the undisputed evidence\n\nbefore the trial court was joint and several liability of both Appellant and Adria\n\nSimcoe. There was legally insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s take-\n\nnothing judgment with respect to Appellee Adria Simcoe.\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                      ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n     I.      Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s\n\n             finding that enforcement of the oral agreement was not barred by the\n\n             statute of frauds.\n\nStandard of review\n\n      Whether a contract comes within the statute of frauds is a question of law,\n\nwhich is reviewed de novo. Dynegy, Inc. v. Yates, 422 S.W.3d 638, 642 (Tex. 2013).\n\nWhether the circumstances of a particular case fall within an exception to the statute\n\nof frauds is generally a question of fact. Berryman's South Fork, Inc. v. J. Baxter\n\nBrinkmann Int'l Corp., 418 S.W.3d 172, 192 (Tex. App.—Dallas [5th Dist.] 2013).\n\n      For an issue where the opposing party bears the burden of proof, a legal-\n\nsufficiency challenge to an adverse finding will be sustained if the evidence\n\ndemonstrates a complete absence of a vital fact, or if the evidence offered is no more\n\nthan a scintilla. Burbage v. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d 249, 259 (Tex. 2014). More than\n\na scintilla exists when the evidence would enable reasonable and fair-minded people\n\nto reach different conclusions. Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 601\n\n(Tex. 2004). Evidence that creates a mere surmise or suspicion of a vital fact is to\n\nbe regarded as, in legal effect, no evidence. Id. The reviewing court should consider\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, “crediting favorable\n\nevidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless\n\n\n                                         13\n\freasonable jurors could not.” City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807 (Tex.\n\n2005).   In conducting a legal sufficiency review, the Court cannot disregard\n\nundisputed evidence that allows of only one logical inference. Id. at 814.\n\nThe statute of frauds barred enforcement of the alleged oral contract as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       The statute of frauds, as codified in Section 26.01 of the Texas Business and\n\nCommerce Code, applies to “a promise by one person to answer for the debt, default,\n\nor miscarriage of another person.”       TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(b)(2).\n\nEnforceability of such promises or agreements is barred as a matter of law unless\n\nthey are “(1) in writing; and (2) signed by the person to be charged with the promise\n\nor agreement or by someone lawfully authorized to sign for him.” TEX. BUS. & COM.\n\nCODE § 26.01(a).\n\n       The oral contract at issue in the present case falls within the purview of the\n\nstatute of frauds because the Simcoes allegedly agreed to answer for the debt of the\n\nChristophers. See RR 12:23-25; 13:1-4. Accordingly, in order to be enforceable,\n\nthe statute of frauds required that this contract be in writing and signed by the\n\nSimcoes. It is undisputed that there was not a written and signed contract between\n\nthe Simcoes and the Christophers for the debt at issue. RR 21:6-8; 52:6-9. The\n\nstatute of frauds therefore barred enforceability of the oral contract as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n\n                                         14\n\fIn order to enforce the purported oral contract, the burden was on the Christophers\n\nto show some exception to the statute of frauds.\n\n      At trial, the Christophers argued that an exception to the statute of frauds\n\napplied in this case because performance of the oral contract could have been\n\ncompleted within one year’s time (the “One-Year Exception”). RR 83:18-24. The\n\nbasis for the One-Year Exception is found in Section 26.01(b)(6) of the Texas\n\nBusiness and Commerce Code, which states that the statute of frauds does not bar\n\nenforcement of “an agreement which is not to be performed within one year from\n\nthe date of making the agreement.” The question for the trial court was whether the\n\nalleged oral contract was to be performed within one year from the date the\n\nagreement was made.\n\nCalculation of the time for performance depends on the tenor of the agreement and\n\nthe understanding of the parties at the time the agreement is made, excluding merely\n\nfortuitous events.\n\n      To determine the time for performance, the court simply compares the date\n\nthe oral agreement is made to the date when the performance under the oral\n\nagreement is to be completed, and if there is a year or more in between them, a\n\nwriting is required to render the oral agreement enforceable. Young v. Ward, 917\n\nS.W.2d 506, 508 (Tex. App.—Waco, 10th Dist. 1996). In the absence of a known\n\ndate when performance will be completed, the statute of frauds does not apply if\n\n\n                                         15\n\fperformance could conceivably be completed within one year of the agreement’s\n\nmaking. Id. at 509. Whether performance could conceivably be completed within\n\none year depends on the tenor of the agreement and the understanding of the parties\n\nat the time the agreement is made. Id. If performance within one year is dependent\n\nupon some merely fortuitous event, a writing is required to enforce the oral\n\nagreement. Id. at 510–511. If a contract explicitly calls for performance over a\n\nperiod longer than one year, the mere theoretical possibility of termination of the\n\ncontract within one year because of a fortuitous event does not take the contract out\n\nof the statute of frauds. SBC Operations, Inc. v. Business Equation, Inc., 75 S.W.3d\n\n462, 466 (Tex. App.—San Antonio [4th Dist.] 2001).\n\nThe parties disputed what type of performance was required of the Simcoes under\n\nthe oral contract.\n\n      In the instant case, the parties presented conflicting testimony as to what type\n\nof performance was required of the Simcoes under the oral agreement. Appellant\n\ntestified that the Simcoes were only required to make payments for so long as they\n\nhad possession of the Van. RR 70:6-12; 71:16-20. The Christophers maintained\n\nthat performance would be completed when the Simcoes paid all monthly\n\ninstallment payments for the Van owing under the finance agreement signed by the\n\nChristophers, or, alternatively, when the Simcoes’ credit improved and they\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fqualified to refinance the Van into their own names. RR 20:17-18; 24:13-19; 34:25;\n\n35:1-4.\n\n      If the parties to an oral contract testify to conflicting terms, a reviewing court\n\nmust presume the terms were those asserted by the winner. City of Keller, 168\n\nS.W.3d at 819. Accordingly, the reviewing court must presume that performance\n\nunder the oral contract at issue was complete either upon payment of the debt in full\n\nby the Simcoes (“Payment Performance”), or refinance of the debt into the Simcoes’\n\nnames (“Refinance Performance”).\n\n      At trial the Christophers bore the burden of proving that either Payment\n\nPerformance or Refinance Performance could have been completed within one year\n\nin order to enforce the oral contract under the One-Year Exception to the statute of\n\nfrauds.   The proper analysis for the trial court was whether the Christophers\n\npresented sufficient evidence to show that performance could conceivably be\n\ncompleted within one year of the agreement’s making, based upon the tenor of the\n\nagreement and the understanding of the parties, and excluding the possibility of\n\nsome merely fortuitous event. See Young, 917 S.W.2d at 510–511.\n\nThe evidence is legally insufficient to show that Payment Performance could have\n\nbeen completed within one year of the making of the oral contract.\n\n      The only evidence presented to the trial court reflecting the time for\n\ncompletion of Payment Performance was the note signed by the Christophers. RR\n\n\n                                          17\n\f21:9-13; 36:1-5. By the express term of that note, there was indeed a known date\n\nwhen Payment Performance was to be completed. Payment Performance would be\n\ncompleted after five years of monthly installment payments. Id.\n\n      In conducting a legal sufficiency review, the Court cannot disregard\n\nundisputed evidence that allows of only one logical inference. City of Keller v.\n\nWilson, 168 S.W.3d at 814. In the instant case, the only logical inference to be made\n\nfrom the undisputed evidence presented to the trial court was that Payment\n\nPerformance was not to be completed within one year. While there may be some\n\nconceivable possibility that the Simcoes could have paid off the Van within one year,\n\nno evidence was presented at trial showing that was the tenor of the oral agreement\n\nor the understanding of the parties at the time the oral agreement was made. No\n\nevidence was presented to the trial court indicating the Christophers expected the\n\nSimcoes to pay off the Van within one year. To the contrary, the evidence presented\n\nto the trial court indicated that the Christophers knew that the Simcoes were\n\nstruggling financially, and could not afford to pay off the Van within one year. RR\n\n67:22-25; 68:1-3. Completion of Payment Performance within one year could only\n\nhave been possible upon the occurrence of a merely fortuitous event that transformed\n\nthe financial circumstances of the Simcoe family.\n\n      The evidence further demonstrated that the Simcoes actually made payments\n\nfor the Van for over a year, with no complaint from the Christophers or request that\n\n\n                                         18\n\fthey pay the Van off in full. RR 14:24-25; 15:1-5. The fact that over a year lapsed\n\nwithout completion of performance demonstrates that the parties never intended for\n\nthe Simcoes to pay off the Van in full within a year.\n\n      Because the written finance agreement was for a five year term and\n\ncompletion of Payment Performance within one year was only possible upon the\n\noccurrence of a merely fortuitous event, the One-Year Exception does not apply and\n\nthe statute of frauds was a complete bar to enforcement of the oral agreement in this\n\ncase. See SBC Operations, Inc., 75 S.W.3d at 466.\n\nThe evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court’s finding that Refinance\n\nPerformance could conceivably have been completed within one year of the making\n\nof the oral agreement.\n\n      The trial court enforced the oral contract against Appellant, finding that\n\nRefinance Performance of the oral contract was to be completed within one year.\n\nRR 85:15-21. Even considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment, there is no evidence to support the trial court’s finding “that [the Van]\n\ncould have been refinanced” within a year of the agreement’s making. RR at 85:17-\n\n21. No evidence was presented at trial to show whether the Simcoes qualified to\n\nrefinance the Van into their names within a year after the alleged oral agreement was\n\nmade. Further, there was no evidence that it was the tenor of the agreement or the\n\nunderstanding of the parties at the time the agreement was made that the Simcoes\n\n\n                                          19\n\fwould refinance the Van within one year. No evidence was presented that the\n\nChristophers asked the Simcoes to refinance within one year. No evidence was\n\npresented that the Simcoes even attempted to refinance within one year.\n\n       Absent any evidence that Refinance Performance could have been or was to\n\nbe completed within one year, the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that the One Year Exception applied to the alleged oral contract at\n\nissue. Enforcement of the oral contract was barred by the statute of frauds as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n II.   Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s judgment\n\n       solely against Appellant.\n\n\n       Joint and several liability usually arises when two or more promisors in the\n\nsame contract promise the same or different performances to the same promisee.\n\nPitman v. Lightfoot, 937 S.W.2d 496, 528 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996).\n\nObligations of multiple parties to a contract are usually joint and several. Id.\n\nThe undisputed evidence showed that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were liable\n\nunder the alleged oral contract.\n\n       The undisputed evidence presented to the trial court showed that, under the\n\nterms of the alleged oral contract sued upon, both Appellant and his then-wife,\n\nAppellee Adria Simcoe, orally promised the Christophers to pay for the Van. RR\n\n34:25; 35:1-4; 35:11-16; 43:19-25; 50:16-21. Evidence was presented that during\n\n                                          20\n\fthe divorce of Appellant and Adria Simcoe, the Jeep was awarded to Adria Simcoe\n\nand Appellant was asked to take the Van and assume all payments therefore. RR\n\n45:7-16.35:11-16. The evidence further demonstrated that Appellant could not\n\nafford to assume the Van payments individually, prompting him to return the Van to\n\nthe Christophers. RR 63:17-20.\n\n      The oral contract that the Christophers sued upon was allegedly made on that\n\ndate when the Christophers acquired the Van. RR 14:24-25; 27:22. Regardless of\n\nwhatever subsequent negotiation or agreement was allegedly made regarding the\n\nvehicles upon the divorce of Appellant and Adria Simcoe, the terms of the oral\n\ncontract as they stood on June 30, 2010 are controlling.\n\n      It is undisputed that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were parties to the oral\n\ncontract as promisors. The terms of the oral contract did not differentiate or\n\napportion liability between Appellant and Adria Simcoe.         See RR 50:16-21.\n\nAccordingly, the only theory of liability supported by the undisputed evidence\n\nbefore the trial court was joint and several liability of both Appellant and Adria\n\nSimcoe. See Pitman, 937 S.W.2d at 528. There was legally insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the trial court’s take-nothing judgment with respect to Appellee Adria\n\nSimcoe. RR 86:5-14.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n      The undisputed evidence before the trial court was that the contract the\n\nChristophers sued on was not in writing or signed by the Christophers. It was\n\ntherefore unenforceable under the statute of frauds.        There was no evidence\n\npresented to the trial court to show that the Simcoes were to refinance the Van within\n\none year. The evidence is therefore factually insufficient evidence to support the\n\ntrial court’s finding that the oral contract was enforceable under the One Year\n\nException to the statute of frauds.\n\n      The undisputed evidence shows that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were\n\nparties to the oral contract at issue as promisors. The terms of the oral contract did\n\nnot differentiate or apportion liability between Appellant and Adria Simcoe.\n\nAccordingly, the only theory of liability supported by the undisputed evidence\n\nbefore the trial court was joint and several liability of both Appellant and Adria\n\nSimcoe. There was legally insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s take-\n\nnothing judgment with respect to Appellee Adria Simcoe.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n      Appellant Brian Simcoe respectfully prays this Court grant his appeal, and\n\nhold that enforcement of the oral contract is barred by the statue of frauds. Appellant\n\nfurther prays that this Court reverse the judgment of the trial court, and render\n\njudgment that Appellees, the Christophers, take nothing against him by way of their\n\n\n                                          22\n\fclaims. Appellant prays that, in the alternative, this Court reverse the judgment of\n\nthe trial court, and render judgment holding Appellee Adria Simcoe jointly and\n\nseverally liable for all damages and attorney’s fees awarded to Appellees, the\n\nChristophers. Appellant further prays for all other and further relief to which he may\n\nbe entitled.\n\n                                       Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                       /s/ Sarah Anne Lishman\n                                       Sarah Anne Lishman\n                                       State Bar No. 24086267\n                                       Jamie L.

Granada Biosciences, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 167, 170 (Tex. 2003)). The publication at issue in that case was defamatory of\nthe owner of the business, and not the landfill-services business itself. Id. at 150-51 n.35. In other words, defamation injures the\nreputation of the owner, not the owner’s business. Id. In a defamation per se claim, general damages are presumed, while special damages\nare not; special damages, on the other hand, are an essential [**26] element of a business disparagement claim. Id. at 155. We distinguish\nbetween ″general damages (which are non-economic damages such as for loss of reputation or mental anguish) and special damages\n(which are economic damages such as for lost income).″ Hancock v. Variyam, 400 S.W.3d 59, 65 (Tex. 2013).\nTurning back to this case, Kirk seems to seek damages to the business, rather than damages for loss of the business’s reputation. This\nfine distinction matters. If Kirk desired damages to protect the economic interests of the Burbage Funeral Home, a business\ndisparagement claim provides the correct vehicle. See Forbes, 124 S.W.3d at 170. And, whether under defamation or business\ndisparagement, we require a plaintiff requesting special damages to prove those damages. See Hancock, 400 S.W.3d at 66. Here, the type\nof damages Kirk seeks, economic damages, are distinct from the noneconomic damages that are presumed in a defamation per se case.\nKirk did not plead these special damages and certainly has not proven them. Kirk could have brought business disparagement or\ndefamation claims (or both), but in any case his proof will not suffice for recovery of special damages.\n\n                                                  Jamie Graham Page 17 of 20\n\f                         447 S.W.3d 249, *261; 2014 Tex.

See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(a), (b)(2). Dynegy, Inc.\ncontends that this provision bars the current suit because both the fraudulent inducement\nand breach of contract claims against it are based on an oral promise to an attorney to\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 3 of 11\n\f                          422 S.W.3d 638, *640; 2013 Tex. LEXIS 679, **1\n\n\n\npay the attorney’s fees incurred by one of Dynegy’s former officers. We agree.\nAccordingly, we reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render a take-nothing\njudgment in favor of Dynegy.\n\nI. Background\nA grand jury indicted James Olis, a former officer of Dynegy, on multiple counts of\nsecurities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy arising out of work he performed\nwhile at Dynegy. [**2] Dynegy’s board of directors passed a resolution authorizing the\nadvancement of attorney’s fees for Olis’s defense provided that Olis acted in good faith,\nin Dynegy’s best interests, and in compliance with applicable law. The resolution\nprovided that it ″may be modified or revoked by this Board at any time as a result of\nchanges in circumstances or further analysis.″\nOlis hired Terry Yates, a criminal defense attorney, to defend him in the federal criminal\ninvestigation and an ongoing civil investigation conducted by the Securities and\nExchange Commission. Olis told Yates and Mark Clark, Yates’s associate, that Dynegy\nwould be paying his legal fees. Clark called Cristin Cracraft, an attorney in Dynegy’s\nlegal department, who orally confirmed that Dynegy would pay Olis’s legal fees. Clark\ntestified that Cracraft stated, ″The Board has passed a resolution, so, yes, we are paying\nJamie Olis’s fees,″ and instructed Clark that the bills should be submitted to her.\nCracraft’s trial testimony was similar to Clark’s version of the conversation. Olis signed\na written fee agreement with Yates under which Olis agreed that he was responsible for\npayment of his legal fees. The contract stated that [**3] ″all fees are due when billed\nunless other specific arrangements have been made.″ Yates testified that, despite the\nwritten fee agreement, he had an oral agreement with Olis under which Yates would\nnever look to Olis for payment of fees, but instead would look to Dynegy for payment.\nYates testified that he spoke to Cracraft after faxing his fee agreement and hourly rate\nto Dynegy and that Cracraft told him Dynegy would pay Olis’s legal fees through trial.\nCracraft contradicted Yates’s testimony about the phone call, however, stating that she\nhad spoken only to Clark and never to Yates as of the date of the trial.\nDynegy then hand-delivered a letter notifying Yates that it would pay him directly for\nOlis’s legal fees through August 17, 2003, but the remaining fees incurred were to be\npaid into escrow pursuant to a board resolution. Dynegy paid Yates’s initial invoice for\n$15,000. Yates submitted his $105,176 July bill in August, but Dynegy did not pay it\nuntil after trial in November. Olis was ultimately convicted of securities fraud, mail and\nwire fraud, and conspiracy. United States v. Olis, 429 F.3d 540, 549 (5th Cir. 2005)\n(affirming the conviction but remanding to the trial court [**4] to reconsider the proper\nsentencing guidelines). Yates submitted a third and final invoice for $448,556,\nrepresenting all work performed from August 2003 through April 2004, including the\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 4 of 11\n\f                          422 S.W.3d 638, *640; 2013 Tex. LEXIS 679, **4\n\n\n\nNovember 2003 trial. Dynegy initially escrowed that amount pursuant to the board\nresolution, but later refused to release the escrowed funds after concluding that Olis did\nnot meet the ″good faith″ standard for indemnification as required by the board’s\nresolution.\nYates filed suit against Dynegy to recover the unpaid attorney’s fees, alleging that\nDynegy orally promised that it would pay Yates’s fees through Olis’s trial. Yates\nasserted claims for breach of contract and [*641] fraudulent inducement and sought\nbenefit-of-the-bargain damages for both claims. After a three-week trial, the jury found\nfor Yates on both claims. Yates ultimately elected to recover under his fraudulent\ninducement claim, and the trial court rendered judgment on that claim in favor of Yates.\nDynegy filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on its affirmative\ndefense of statute of frauds, which the trial court denied. Dynegy appealed.\nThe court of appeals initially reversed and rendered judgment for Dynegy based on its\n [**5] affirmative defense of statute of frauds. No. 04-10-00041-CV, 2010 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 3556, at *1 (Tex. App.—San Antonio May 12, 2010). Thereafter, the court of\nappeals denied Yates’s motion for rehearing while also issuing a revised opinion. No.\n04-10-00041-CV, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 6915, at *1 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Aug. 25,\n2010). Then the same panel, on its own motion, reconsidered and granted Yates’s\nmotion for rehearing. 345 S.W.3d 516, 519 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011). In its third\nopinion, the court of appeals reversed itself based on the main purpose doctrine, holding\nthat Dynegy intended to bind itself to a primary obligation rather than a promise to pay\nthe debt of another, and the statute of frauds was therefore inapplicable. Id. at 520,\n523-25. The court of appeals also reversed the trial court’s judgment based on the jury’s\nfraud finding, holding that the evidence was legally insufficient. Id. at 534. The court\nof appeals then rendered judgment for Yates on his breach of contract claim. Id. at 536.\nDynegy petitions this Court for review, arguing that the court of appeals erred by\nconsidering an element of the main purpose doctrine, which is an exception to the\nstatute of [**6] frauds, as a part of Dynegy’s initial burden on its statute of frauds\naffirmative defense. We agree.\n\nII. Analysis\nHN2 The statute of frauds generally renders a contract that falls within its purview\nunenforceable. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(a). The party pleading the statute of\nfrauds bears the initial burden of establishing its applicability. TEX. R. CIV. P. 94; cf.\nWoods v. William M. Mercer, Inc., 769 S.W.2d 515, 517 (Tex. 1988) (holding that the\nparty pleading statute of limitations has the initial burden of proof). Once that party\nmeets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to establish an exception\nthat would take the verbal contract out of the statute of frauds. See Cobb v. Johnson, 101\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 5 of 11\n\f                          422 S.W.3d 638, *641; 2013 Tex. LEXIS 679, **6\n\n\n\nTex. 440, 108 S.W. 811, 812 (Tex. 1908). One recognized exception to the statute of\nfrauds’ suretyship provision is the main purpose doctrine. See Cruz v. Andrews\nRestoration, Inc., 364 S.W.3d 817, 827-28 (Tex. 2012). The party seeking to avoid the\nstatute of frauds must plead, prove, and secure findings as to an exception or risk waiver\nunder Rule 279 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. See, e.g., Crown Ranch Dev., Ltd.\nv. Cromwell, No. 09-10-00458-CV, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1345, at *14-15 (Tex.\nApp.—Beaumont Feb. 23, 2012, pet. denied) [**7] (mem. op.) (″A party who contends\nthat an agreement falls within an exception to the statute of frauds must request and\nobtain a jury finding on the exception.″); W.H. McCrory & Co. v. Contractors Equip. &\nSupply Co., 691 S.W.2d 717, 720-21 (Tex. App.—Austin 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (placing\nthe burden on the plaintiff to plead and prove an exception to the statute of frauds); cf.\nWoods, 769 S.W.2d at 517-18 (holding that the discovery rule, as a defense to the statute\nof limitations, is a plea in confession and avoidance that is waived if not pled).\n\nA. Dynegy Met its Initial Burden to Establish Applicability of the Statute of Frauds\n[*642] Here, Dynegy pled the statute of frauds as an affirmative defense and thus had\nthe initial burden to establish that the alleged promise fell within the statute of frauds.\nSee TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(a), (b)(2); TEX. R. CIV. P. 94. HN3 Whether a contract\ncomes within the statute of frauds is a question of law, which we review de novo. See\nBratcher v. Dozier, 162 Tex. 319, 346 S.W.2d 795, 796 (Tex. 1961). The statute of frauds’\nsuretyship provision applies to ″a promise by one person to answer for the debt, default,\nor miscarriage [**8] of another person.″ TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(b)(2). Yates\nargues that the suretyship provision does not apply to the oral agreement in this case\nbecause there is not a preexisting debt. On the contrary, the suretyship provision applies\nregardless of ″whether [the debt was] already incurred or to be incurred in the future.″\nSee RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 112 cmt. b (1981).\nThe record indicates that Olis hired Yates to represent him in the criminal proceedings.\nOlis signed a fee agreement with Yates, in which Dynegy was not mentioned. Yates\nagreed to defend Olis, and Olis agreed in exchange that fees were due when billed\nunless other arrangements were made. Both Clark and Yates testified that Cracraft orally\npromised that Dynegy would be paying Olis’s fees through trial, and it is undisputed\nthat this agreement was never reduced to writing. These facts establish one conclusion:\nDynegy orally promised to pay attorney’s fees associated with Olis’s defense that, under\nthe fee agreement, were Olis’s obligation (i.e., Olis’s debt). The dissent, like the court\nof appeals, believes that Dynegy’s promise to pay Olis’s legal fees was a primary\nobligation and not a promise to pay [**9] another’s debts, and therefore the statute of\nfrauds does not bar Yates’s recovery on his breach of contract claim. But, as we have\nexplained, HN4 a plaintiff relying on a primary obligor theory under the main purpose\ndoctrine must plead and establish facts to take a verbal contract out of the statute of\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 6 of 11\n\f                                        422 S.W.3d 638, *642; 2013 Tex. LEXIS 679, **9\n\n\n\nfrauds. See Cruz, 364 S.W.3d at 828; Gulf Liquid Fertilizer Co. v. Titus, 163 Tex. 260,\n354 S.W.2d 378, 382-83 (Tex. 1962); Cobb, 108 S.W. at 812. We hold that Dynegy\nestablished as a matter of law that the statute of frauds’ suretyship provision initially\napplied to bar the claims against it. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(b)(2) (providing\nthat ″a promise by one person to answer for the debt . . . of another person″ falls within\nthe statute of frauds). The court of appeals erred when it held otherwise.\n\nB. The Burden Shifted to Yates\nAt this point, the burden shifted to Yates to establish an exception that would take the\nverbal contract out of the statute of frauds—namely, the main purpose doctrine. See\nCobb, 108 S.W. at 812. The main purpose doctrine required Yates to prove: (1) Dynegy\nintended to create primary responsibility in itself to pay the debt; (2) there was\nconsideration for the promise; [**10] and (3) the consideration given for the promise\nwas primarily for Dynegy’s own use and benefit—that is, the benefit it received was\nDynegy’s main purpose for making the promise. See Cruz, 364 S.W.3d at 828. We have\nnoted that the question of intent to be primarily responsible for the debt is a question for\nthe finder of fact, taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case. See\nHaas Drilling Co. v. First Nat’l Bank, 456 S.W.2d 886, 889 (Tex. 1970) (citing Gulf\nLiquid Fertilizer Co., 354 S.W.2d at 384). Thus, the burden was on Yates to secure\nfavorable findings on the main purpose doctrine.1 Yates’s failure to do so constituted a\nwaiver of the issue under Rule 279 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. [*643] See\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 279; W.H. McCrory & Co., 691 S.W.2d at 720-21; cf. Woods, 769 S.W.2d\nat 518 (holding the discovery rule waived when a party neither pled nor obtained\nfindings on the issue in response to the opposing party’s limitations defense). Therefore,\nthe court of appeals erred by considering the intent element of the main purpose doctrine\nin conjunction with determining whether Dynegy met its initial burden to show\napplicability of the statute of frauds.2\n\nIII. Conclusion\nBased on the preceding analysis, we hold that the statute of frauds renders the oral\nagreement between Dynegy and Yates unenforceable. Consequently, Yates cannot\nrecover under his breach of contract claim. In addition, Yates’s claim for\nbenefit-of-the-bargain damages pursuant to his alternative fraudulent inducement action\nis barred. See Haase v. Glazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 799 (Tex. 2001) HN5 (″[T]he Statute\n1\n    Dynegy [**11] even pointed out to the trial court and Yates the omission of any jury questions related to an exception to the statute\nof frauds in its written charge objections.\n2\n    The dissent also argues that the main purpose doctrine takes Dynegy’s promise out of the statute of frauds based on Dynegy’s\nself-serving reasons for promising to pay Olis’s legal fees. But, as with the intent element, Yates failed to plead and prove the\nconsideration elements of the main purpose exception.\n\n                                                  Jamie Graham Page 7 of 11\n\f                                       422 S.W.3d 638, *643; 2013 Tex. LEXIS 679, **11\n\n\n\nof Frauds bars a fraud claim to the extent the plaintiff seeks to recover as damages the\nbenefit of a bargain that cannot otherwise be enforced because it fails to comply with\nthe Statute of Frauds.″). Accordingly, we grant Dynegy’s petition for review and,\nwithout hearing oral argument, TEX. R. APP. P. 59.1, [**12] we reverse the court of\nappeals’ judgment and render judgment that Yates take nothing on his claims.\n\nPaul W. Green\n\nJustice\n\nOPINION DELIVERED: August 30, 2013\n\nDissent by: John P. Devine\n\nDissent\n\nJUSTICE DEVINE, dissenting.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds ″is a two-edged sword. It . . . may be used to perpetrate frauds as\nwell as to prevent them. Under it a person may obtain an oral promise to pay the debt\nof a third person and then resist payment on the ground that this promise is oral and\ntherefore unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. Because of this and other dangers,\nthe courts of England and this country have sought to keep the Statute within its\nintended purpose.″1\n\nIn this case, the Court applies the Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision to, what the\njury found to be, an unconditional promise by a company to pay an attorney to defend\none of its employees from a work-related prosecution. Because I do not believe the\nStatute was intended to apply to such promises, I respectfully dissent.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision applies when a creditor seeks to recover\nfrom a guarantor because of a third person’s failure to perform.2 The provision\n [**13] discourages false allegations that a person promised to pay if the primary debtor\ncould not.3 The provision also protects [*644] those closely associated with the\nprincipal debtor from making rash or emotionally-driven oral promises before having\n″any real opportunity for awareness of the nature and magnitude of the risks\n1\n    Gulf Liquid Fertilizer Co. v. Titus, 163 Tex. 260, 354 S.W.2d 378, 382 (Tex. 1962).\n2\n    The essential elements of a surety relationship are (1) the third person and the surety are each bound to the same performance; and,\n(2) the third person, rather than the surety, should be the one to perform.

Perillo ed., rev. ed. 1997) (″To be within the suretyship clause of\nthe statute, the defendant’s (S’s) duty to pay must be conditional on nonpayment by the third person (P) . . . .″) (emphasis added).\n3\n    Cooper Petroleum Co. v.

LEXIS 679, **15\n\n\n\nundertaken.″4 The suretyship provision, however, is not intended to provide more\ncertainty to the terms of an oral contract for the benefit of a third person.5 Nor is it\nintended to discourage oral promises to assume the debt of a third person.6\n\nThe Court states that the facts here ″establish one conclusion: Dynegy orally promised\nto pay attorney’s fees associated with Olis’ defense [that would have otherwise been\nOlis’ obligation.]″ S.W.3d at . I agree, but the inference I draw from that conclusion\nis that Dynegy assumed the role of primary obligor, not surety. As we explained in Bank\nof Garvin v. Freeman, the Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision does not bar an oral\npromise to assume primary responsibility for the debt of another:\n\n     The meaning of that statute is to require a promise as surety for another’s debt,\n     or guarantor of another’s debt, to be in writing. It never was intended to prohibit\n     one person from assuming the payment of another’s debt, as his own debt, where\n     there is a valid consideration moving between the parties to such contract. In\n     other words, one person for a valuable consideration may assume as his own debt\n     the debt of another, and it need not be in writing, but he cannot [**15] contract\n     with one person to become surety or guarantor for the debt of another person\n     except it be in writing.7\n\nHere, Dynegy does not claim that a surety relationship existed between Olis and itself.\nDynegy argues instead that the suretyship provision applies merely because Olis and\nYates entered into a written fee agreement, creating a debt. But if the creation of a debt\nwas all that was necessary to invoke the Statute of Frauds, it would not be possible to\nassume another’s debt by oral agreement, and the Court was wrong to say otherwise in\nBank of Garvin.8\n\nFor its part, Dynegy does not claim to be the guarantor of Olis’ debt. Dynegy instead\nconcedes that it agreed to pay Yates for Olis’ defense, but argues that a condition in the\nboard resolution allowed it to stop paying Yates if Dynegy’s board determined that Olis\ndid not act in good faith. At that point, according to Dynegy, Olis became responsible\nfor Yates’ fee. But the board resolution did not make Dynegy the guarantor of Olis’ debt,\nnor did it give the company the right to stop or suspend payment to the attorney\n [**16] for services already rendered. The board resolution merely stated that the\n4\n    4 BROWN, supra, § 16.1, [**14] at 317.\n5\n    See id. § 15.7, at 268 (″[I]t is enough to take the defendant’s promise out of the statute that the third person was not bound at all to\nthe promisee.″).\n6\n    See Bank of Garvin v. Freeman, 107 Tex. 523, 181 S.W. 187, 190-91 (Tex. 1915).\n7\n    Titus, 354 S.W.2d at 383-84 (quoting Bank of Garvin, 181 S.W. at 191 (emphasis added)).\n8\n    Bank of Garvin, 181 S.W. at 191.\n\n                                                   Jamie Graham Page 9 of 11\n\f                                       422 S.W.3d 638, *644; 2013 Tex. LEXIS 679, **16\n\n\n\nemployee was to repay the company if his actions were determined not to have been in\ngood faith.\nThe dispute in this case is therefore not about whether Dynegy agreed to pay Yates; it\nclearly did. The dispute instead is about the extent of Dynegy’s promise. Dynegy\ncontends that its promise to Yates was conditioned by the terms of the board resolution.\nYates contends that Dynegy’s promise to pay for Olis’ defense through trial was\nunconditional and, as to Yates, primarily the company’s responsibility.\nThe dispute was submitted to a jury, which was asked to determine the extent of\nDynegy’s agreement with Yates. The [*645] charge instructed the jury that an essential\nterm of the asserted agreement was whether Dynegy agreed to pay Yates for his legal\nservices to Olis through trial.9 In closing argument, Dynegy argued that the jury should\nnot find it in breach of the agreement unless it believed Dynegy made an unconditional\npromise to pay Yates through trial. The jury found Dynegy in breach of its agreement\nto pay Yates and awarded damages, apparently reasoning that the conditional payment\nterms of the board resolution did [**17] not apply to the oral contract between Dynegy\nand Yates.\nThe Court concludes, however, that the written fee agreement between Yates and Olis\nconclusively establishes Olis as the primary obligor, making Dynegy merely the surety\nof that obligation. Because Dynegy never intended to act as a guarantor of Olis’ debt,\nhowever, the Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision should not apply as a matter of law.\nI therefore disagree with the Court’s conclusion, but even if I agreed with it, I would\nnevertheless hold that the main purpose exception takes Dynegy’s promise to Yates out\nof the Statute.\nThe main purpose doctrine, or leading object rule, takes a promise out of the Statute\nwhere ″the consideration given for the promise is primarily for the promisor’s own use\nand benefit.″10 The test focuses on the purpose of the promise, rather than on who\nreceives the benefit of the promise.11 This test was devised by the courts to determine\nwhether ″the promise was manifestly induced by other than [**18] gratuitous or\nsentimental purposes.″12\nThe circumstances surrounding the promise in this case began with an SEC investigation\ninto Project Alpha. Dynegy originally billed Project Alpha as a complex transaction that\n9\n   The charge instructions also stated that the terms of an agreement may be oral or written, or both, and that the parties must have the\nsame understanding of the subject matter at the time of the agreement.\n10\n     Titus, 354 S.W.2d at 383.\n11\n     Cruz v.

The SEC investigation resulted in a civil fine\nrelated to the company’s tax classification of the assets involved. However, the\nDepartment of Justice’s investigation was just beginning.\nAs media publicity and threats of indictment by the Department of Justice increased,\nDynegy’s board passed a resolution promising to advance attorney’s fees to officers and\nemployees of the company who were involved with Project Alpha. Dynegy’s bylaws\nrequired the company to indemnify its directors and officers for any civil or criminal\n [**19] proceedings arising out of their role as a Dynegy director or officer. Dynegy paid\nOlis’ first attorney directly and, when Olis desired to hire Yates, the company told Yates\nto send the bills to the company and that it would pay him directly. The urgency in\nsecuring the services of Yates, a more experienced trial attorney, was heightened by\nOlis’ recent indictment. Therefore, Dynegy had at least two self-serving reasons to\npromise to pay Yates to represent Olis: (1) to protect the company’s interests; and (2)\nto comply with its bylaws. Yates should therefore be able to enforce Dynegy’s oral\ncontract to [*646] pay him through trial because Dynegy was acting for its own\npurposes and not merely as a guarantor of its employee’s obligation.13\nIn conclusion, Dynegy has not asserted or argued that it intended to act as a guarantor\nof Olis’ debt. Moreover, the jury agreed that [**20] Dynegy’s promise to pay Yates\nthrough trial was not conditional, and thus its promise does not fall within the Statute\nof Frauds’ suretyship provision. However, even were I to agree that the suretyship\nprovision otherwise applies to this transaction, I would conclude that the main purpose\nexception takes Dynegy’s promise out of the Statute. Because the Court holds the\nStatute of Frauds applies to bar Dynegy’s oral contract with Yates, I respectfully dissent.\nJohn P.

The question was whether the court of appeals\napplied the correct standard in its legal sufficiency review by considering only the\nevidence and inferences that supported the finding. The court held that both the\ninclusive and exclusive standards for the scope of legal-sufficiency review, properly\napplied, must arrive at the same result, disregarding evidence contrary to the verdict\nunless reasonable jurors could not. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the\ncourt of appeals did not properly apply the scope of review in that the critical question\nwas the city’s state of mind because the owners had to prove the city knew that flooding\nwas substantially certain, and the court of appeals disregarded the evidence regarding\nwhy the city approved the plan. It was uncontroverted that three sets of engineers\ncertified that the revised plans met the city’s codes and regulations, and thus would not\nincrease downstream flooding. Further, the court of appeals declined to address the\njury’s alternate verdict on a claim under the Texas Water Code.\n\nOutcome\nThe court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded.\n\nLexisNexis® Headnotes\n\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Standards of Review > Substantial Evidence > General Overview\n\nHN1 ″No evidence″ points must, and may only, be sustained when the record discloses\none of the following situations: (a) a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (b)\nthe court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only\nevidence offered to prove a vital fact; (c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no\nmore than a mere scintilla; (d) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the\nvital fact.

First, an appellate court\nconducting a legal sufficiency review cannot disregard undisputed evidence that allows\nof only one logical inference. By definition, such evidence can be viewed in only one\nlight, and reasonable jurors can reach only one conclusion from it.

Undisputed evidence that reasonable jurors could disbelieve has\ntwo: (1) it is true, or (2) it is not. Most often, undisputed contrary evidence becomes\nconclusive (and thus cannot be disregarded) when it concerns physical facts that cannot\nbe denied.

Over the years, we have stated both as the\nproper scope of review. While some see the standards as opposing, we disagree; like a\nglass that is half-full or half-empty, both arrive at the same point regardless of where\nthey start.\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 7 of 41\n\f                                        168 S.W.3d 802, *807; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **1\n\n\n\nBut both standards must be properly applied. Rules and reason sometimes compel that\nevidence must be credited or discarded whether it supports a verdict or contradicts it.\nUnder either scope of review, appellate courts must view the evidence in the light\nfavorable to the verdict, crediting favorable [**2] evidence if reasonable jurors could,\nand disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. As we find the\nevidence here meets neither standard, we reverse.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural History\nThe City of Keller is one of several fast-growing communities on the outskirts of [*808]\nFort Worth. 1 As part of that growth, the City approved plans for two new subdivisions,\nEstates of Oak Run and Rancho Serena, including plans for storm water drainage.\n\nThe Wilsons own property southeast of the new subdivisions, with a tract owned by Z.T.\nSebastian lying between. Before development, surface water flowed generally north to\nsouth from the land where the subdivisions were built, across the Sebastian and Wilson\nproperties, and into the Little Bear Creek Watershed.\nIn 1991, the [**3] City adopted a Master Drainage Plan providing for drainage\neasements across both the Sebastian and Wilson properties, and thence into Little Bear\nCreek. The City’s codes require developers to comply with the Master Plan, to provide\ndrainage for a 100-year rain event, and to avoid increasing the volume or velocity of\nwater discharged upon downhill properties.\n\nThe developers of Oak Run and Rancho Serena submitted plans to the City indicating\nthey would buy a drainage easement and build a ditch forty-five feet wide and more than\ntwo hundred yards long across the Sebastian property, and deed both to the City upon\ncompletion. 2 The plans also included detention basins on the subdivision properties, but\nomitted any drainage easement or ditch across the Wilsons’ property. The City’s director\nof public works approved the developers’ plans, and the City accepted the works on\ncompletion.\n    [**4] In accordance with the Master Plan, the City built a box culvert south of the\nWilsons’ property. But as the developers’ drainage ditch ended at the Wilsons’ north\nproperty line, there was no link between the two. The Wilsons alleged and the jury found\nthis omission increased flooding on the Wilsons’ property, ruining eight acres of\nfarmland the jury valued at almost $ 300,000.\n1\n   The City of Fort Worth asserts in an amicus brief that in 2001 alone it approved 325 subdivision plats creating 5,857 residential lots\nwithin its extraterritorial jurisdiction, which of course excludes surrounding communities.\n2\n   Evidence at trial and briefs by amici indicate that cities normally acquire title to these easements to ensure they are properly mowed\nand maintained after the developers’ departure.\n\n                                                  Jamie Graham Page 8 of 41\n\f                                        168 S.W.3d 802, *808; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **4\n\n\n\nTo recover damages for inverse condemnation, the Wilsons had to prove the City\nintentionally took or damaged their property for public use, or was substantially certain\nthat would be the result. 3 They do not allege the City intentionally flooded their land,\nbut do allege it approved revised plans that it knew were substantially certain to have\nthat effect.\nThe City contends no evidence supports the jury’s finding of an intentional taking. It\npresented evidence that engineers for the developers, for the City, and for an outside\n [**5] firm the City retained all certified that the revised drainage plan complied with\nthe City’s codes and regulations -- including the ban against increasing downstream\nrunoff. Thus, the City asserts it had no reason to be substantially certain the opposite\nwould occur, until it did.\nA divided court of appeals rejected this contention. 4 In its legal sufficiency review, the\ncourt refused to consider the various engineers’ certifications because ″we are to\nconsider only the evidence and inferences that tend to support the finding and disregard\nall evidence and inferences to the contrary.″ 5 The City challenges [*809] this omission\nas applying the wrong scope of review.\nWe have on many occasions stated the scope of review precisely as the court of appeals\nsays (the ″exclusive″ standard). 6 [**7] But we have also stated that a reviewing court\nmust consider ″all of the evidence″ in the light favorable to the verdict (the ″inclusive″\nstandard).

HN3 Evidence can be disregarded whenever reasonable\njurors could do so, 18 an inquiry that is necessarily fact-specific.

LEXIS 436, **13\n\n\n\nIn Justice Calvert’s first situation -- a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact -- it\nis generally irrelevant whether a reviewing court considers contrary evidence. 19 If\nsupporting evidence is absent, opposing evidence cannot change that result. But in a\nnumber of cases, the lack of supporting evidence may not appear until all the evidence\nis reviewed in context.\n [**14] For example, publications alleged to be defamatory must be viewed as a whole\n-- including accompanying statements, headlines, pictures, and the general tenor and\nreputation of the source itself. 20 A court reviewing legal sufficiency cannot disregard\nparts of a publication, considering only false statements to support a plaintiff’s verdict\nor only true ones to support a defense verdict. 21\n\nSimilarly, reviewing courts must construe contracts as a whole; we do not consider only\nthe parts favoring one party [**15] and disregard the remainder, as that would render\nthe latter meaningless. 22 Even writings executed at different times must be considered\ntogether if they pertain to the same transaction. 23\n\nIt is not just writings that reviewing courts must consider in context. For example, in\nreviewing intentional infliction of emotional distress claims for legal sufficiency, ″we\nconsider the context and the relationship between the parties.″ 24 [**16] Acts that might\nconstitute outrageous conduct when dealing with a hearing-impaired consumer 25 may\nbe legally insufficient between [*812] business parties. 26 In our no-evidence reviews\nof successful claims, we have invariably reviewed not just evidence showing the\nconduct was outrageous, but also evidence showing that, in context, it was not. 27\n19\n    Calvert, supra note 12, at 364 (″If there is an absolute absence of evidence of a vital fact . . . an appellate court has no occasion\nto concern itself with an abstract rule such as how minds of reasonable men might view the situation.″).\n20\n    New Times, Inc. v.

LEXIS 436, **16\n\n\n\nMore generally, evidence cannot be taken out of context in a way that makes it seem to\nsupport a verdict when in fact it never did. 28 If a witness’s statement ″I did not do that″\nis contrary to the jury’s verdict, a reviewing court may need to disregard the whole\nstatement, but cannot rewrite [**17] it by disregarding the middle word alone.\nThus, HN4 if evidence may be legally sufficient in one context but insufficient in\nanother, the context cannot be disregarded even if that means rendering judgment\ncontrary to the jury’s verdict. Either ″evidence contrary to the verdict″ must be defined\nto exclude material contextual evidence, or it must be an exception to the general rule.\n\nB. Competency Evidence\nIt has long been the rule in Texas thatHN5 incompetent evidence is legally insufficient\nto support a judgment, even if admitted without objection. 29 Thus, evidence showing\nit to be incompetent cannot be disregarded, even if the result is contrary to the verdict.\nIf the rule were otherwise, incompetent evidence would always be legally sufficient,\nbecause the evidence showing it to be incompetent could never be [**18] considered.\n\nThus, for example, if an eyewitness’s location renders a clear view of an accident\n″physically impossible,″ it is no evidence of what occurred, even if the eyewitness\nthinks otherwise. 30 Similarly, an employee’s testimony that he was in the course and\nscope of his employment is legally insufficient to support a verdict against his employer\nif the evidence shows that legal conclusion to be incompetent. 31\n [**19] This exception frequently applies to expert testimony. When expert testimony\nis required, lay evidence supporting liability is legally insufficient. 32 In [*813] such\ncases, a no-evidence review cannot disregard contrary evidence showing the witness\nwas unqualified to give an opinion. 33 And if an expert’s opinion is based on certain\n\n28\n    Bostrom Seating, Inc. v.

Again, such evidence cannot be disregarded; it must be an exception either\nto the exclusive standard of review or to the definition of contrary evidence.\n\nC. Circumstantial Equal Evidence\n\nAs noted above, Justice Calvert believed the exclusive standard applied only when a\nno-evidence challenge asserted the evidence was no more than a scintilla. 39 But he went\non to note a ″variation″ that required contrary inferences to be considered when the\nequal-inference rule applied. 40\n\nIn claims or defenses supported only by meager circumstantial evidence, the evidence\ndoes not rise above a scintilla (and thus is legally insufficient) if jurors would have to\nguess whether a vital fact exists. 41 ″When the circumstances are equally consistent with\n34\n    See Burroughs Wellcome Co. v.

First, an appellate court\nconducting a legal sufficiency review cannot ″disregard undisputed evidence that allows\nof only one logical inference.″ 50 [**26] By definition, such evidence can be viewed in\nonly one light, and reasonable jurors can reach only one conclusion from it. Jurors are\nnot free to reach a verdict contrary to such evidence; 51 indeed, uncontroverted issues\n [*815] need not be submitted to a jury at all. 52\n\nHN9 Reviewing legal sufficiency in such cases encompasses a general no-evidence\nreview, because if some evidence supports the verdict then the contrary evidence was\nnot ″undisputed.″ But the review does not stop there; [**27] the evidence must also\nhave only one logical inference. Undisputed evidence that reasonable jurors could\ndisbelieve has two: (1) it is true, or (2) it is not.\nMost often, undisputed contrary evidence becomes conclusive (and thus cannot be\ndisregarded) when it concerns physical facts that cannot be denied. Thus, no evidence\nsupports an impaired-access claim if it is undisputed that access remains along 90\npercent of a tract’s frontage. 53 Evidence that a buyer believed a product had been\nrepaired is conclusively negated by an accompanying letter to the contrary. 54 And an\ninsured’s liability has not been determined by an ″actual trial″ if the insured did not\nappear, present evidence, or challenge anything presented by his opponent. 55\n[**28] Undisputed contrary evidence may also become conclusive when a party admits\nit is true.

LEXIS 436, **31\n\n\n\nNevertheless, we held there was no evidence to support the paternity verdict because of\nconclusive evidence to the contrary. 66\nSimilarly, in Texas & New Orleans Railroad Co. v. Compton, we found no evidence that\na railroad’s negligence caused an automobile to slam into the sixtieth car of a\nslow-moving train. 67 Again, the evidence was hotly disputed -- while railroad witnesses\ntestified that warning signs were in place at the crossing, the car’s driver and a passenger\ntestified they saw nothing, and would have been able to stop if they had. 68 Nevertheless,\nwe held there was no evidence to support the claim because, if the driver could not see\nthe side of a train before he hit it, he could not have seen a crossing sign either. 69\n\nOf course, there are few instances in which disputed evidence is conclusive, and many\ninstances in which [**32] undisputed evidence is not. As our sister court has noted,\ntestimony by a paid informant is legally sufficient to support a conviction, even if\n″twenty nuns testify that the defendant was with them at the time, far from the scene of\nthe crime … [and] twenty more nuns testify that they saw the informant commit the\ncrime.″ 70 But a more famous clerical hypothetical by Judge Learned Hand shows the\nopposite limit:\n\n      If, however, it were proved by twenty bishops that either party, when he used the\n      words [in a contract], intended something else than the usual meaning which the\n      law imposes upon them, he would still be held . . . . 71\n\nWhile jurors may generally believe either sinners or saints, their discretion is limited\nwhen it is proved beyond question that an ″eyewitness″ was actually far away in prison\nor totally blind on the day of the crime.\n     [**33]HN11 Proper legal-sufficiency review prevents reviewing courts from\nsubstituting [*817] their opinions on credibility for those of the jurors, but proper\nreview also prevents jurors from substituting their opinions for undisputed truth. When\nevidence contrary to a verdict is conclusive, it cannot be disregarded.\n\nE. Clear-and-Convincing Evidence\n66\n      Id. at 560.

LEXIS 436, **33\n\n\n\nSince the time of Justice Calvert’s article, new claims and burdens of proof have arisen\nthat require additions to the four types of no-evidence review Justice Calvert considered\nexhaustive.\nBeginning with the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Jackson v. Virginia,\nappellate courts have recognized that, while ″one slender bit of evidence″ may be all a\nreviewing court needs to affirm a verdict based on the preponderance of the evidence,\na higher burden of proof requires a higher standard of review. 72 As we recently stated,\nthe standard for legal sufficiency works in tandem with the standard of review --\n″whenever the standard of proof at trial is elevated, the standard of appellate review\nmust likewise be elevated.″ 73 If the rule were otherwise, legally sufficient evidence to\nsupport a preponderance-of-the-evidence verdict would satisfy [**34] the higher\nburdens as well, thus rendering their differences meaningless. 74\nAccordingly, we have held that a legal sufficiency review must consider all the evidence\n(not just that favoring the verdict) in reviewing cases of parental termination, 75 [**35]\ndefamation, 76 and punitive damages. 77 In such cases, again, evidence contrary to a\nverdict cannot be disregarded.\n\nF. Consciousness Evidence\nFurther, we have had to particularize legal-sufficiency review in cases involving what\na party knew or why it took a certain course, as they are not amenable to review under\nthe exclusive standard.\n\nLong before gross negligence had to meet a clear-and-convincing burden, we recognized\nin Burk Royalty Co. v. Walls that no-evidence review of such findings had to include ″all\nof the surrounding facts, circumstances, and conditions, not just individual elements or\nfacts.″ 78 [**36] As then Chief Justice Greenhill noted in concurring, speeding and\nrunning a red light may not be legally sufficient evidence of gross negligence if one’s\n72\n     443 U.S. 307, 320 n.14, 61 L.

Liability in [*818] such cases requires proof that the insurer\ndenied coverage after it became reasonably clear. 81 But that standard will always be met\nif reviewing courts must disregard any evidence that coverage was unclear. 82\nSubsequent cases show that reviewing courts are in fact looking at all the evidence to\ndetermine whether coverage was reasonably clear. 83\n     [**37]This problem arises in other contexts as well. In discrimination cases,\ndischarged employees will never have to prove that the reason given for termination was\na pretext if no-evidence review must disregard that reason. 84 Government officials will\nnever be entitled to immunity if we consider only evidence suggesting they should have\nacted differently. 85 And limitations will never run under the discovery rule if reviewing\ncourts must disregard all evidence that claimants knew of their claims. 86\n [**38] This is not to say a reviewing court may credit a losing party’s explanations or\nexcuses if jurors could disregard them.

LEXIS 436, **38\n\n\n\nexpert report may foreclose bad faith recovery, 87 it will not do so if the insurer had\nsome reason to doubt the report. 88 But a reviewing court cannot review whether jurors\ncould reasonably disregard a losing party’s explanations or excuses without considering\nwhat they were.\n\nIII. Contrary Evidence That Must Be Disregarded\nAs trials normally focus on issues that jurors could decide either way, reviewing [*819]\ncourts must disregard [**39] evidence contrary to the verdict far more often than they\nmust consider it. Just as no-evidence review that starts by disregarding contrary\nevidence often must end up considering considerably more, no-evidence review that\nbegins by considering all the evidence must usually end up considering considerably\nless.\n\nAgain, we do not presume to categorize all circumstances in which contrary evidence\nmust be disregarded; a few examples serve to demonstrate that even under the inclusive\nstandard, viewing all the evidence in a light favorable to the verdict often requires that\nmuch of it be disregarded.\n\nA. Credibility Evidence\nHN12 Jurors are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give\ntheir testimony. 89 [**40] They may choose to believe one witness and disbelieve\nanother. 90 Reviewing courts cannot impose their own opinions to the contrary. 91\nHN13 Most credibility questions are implicit rather than explicit in a jury’s verdict.\nThus, reviewing courts must assume jurors decided all of them in favor of the verdict\nif reasonable human beings could do so. Courts reviewing all the evidence in a light\n\n\n87\n     See, e.g., Provident Am. Ins. Co. v. Castaneda, 988 S.W.2d 189, 194-95, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 215, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct.

LEXIS 436, **40\n\n\n\nfavorable to the verdict thus assume that jurors credited testimony favorable to the\nverdict and disbelieved testimony contrary to it. 92\n [**41] For example, viewing the evidence in the light favorable to the verdict means\nthat if both parties in a traffic accident testify they had the green light, an appellate court\nmust presume the prevailing party did and the losing party did not. If the parties to an\noral contract testify to conflicting terms, a reviewing court must presume the terms were\nthose asserted by the winner. When all the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable\nto the jury verdict, some of it must be completely discounted. Though not disregarded\nat the outset, the end result is the same.\n\nThis has always been our practice in cases using the inclusive scope of review. Thus, we\nhave concluded that a bailee sold cotton without the bailor’s consent, despite the\nformer’s denials, because the jury verdict favored the latter. 93 [**42] And we have\naffirmed a gross negligence verdict based on testimony that the defendant’s speed was\n80 miles per hour, without mentioning his own testimony to a speed half that. 94\nNor is it necessary to have testimony from both parties before jurors [*820] may\ndisbelieve either. HN14 Jurors may disregard even uncontradicted and unimpeached\ntestimony from disinterested witnesses. 95 Thus, an architect’s uncontradicted testimony\nthat he relied on a 20-year warranty was not binding on jurors when the bid\nspecifications he prepared included only much shorter warranties. [**43] 96 Nor was an\ninsured’s uncontradicted testimony about lost furnishings binding on jurors when the\nfire scene contained several indications of arson but few of burnt furniture. 97 Even\nuncontroverted expert testimony does not bind jurors unless the subject matter is one for\nexperts alone. 98\n\n\n92\n     Runnels, 47 S.W. at 972.\n93\n     Cochran v.

LEXIS 436, **43\n\n\n\nOf course, HN15 ″the jury’s decisions regarding credibility must be reasonable.″ 99\n  [**44]    Jurors cannot ignore undisputed testimony that is clear, positive, direct,\notherwise credible, free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been\nreadily controverted. 100 And as noted above, they are not free to believe testimony that\nis conclusively negated by undisputed facts. But whenever reasonable jurors could\ndecide what testimony to discard, a reviewing court must assume they did so in favor\nof their verdict, and disregard it in the course of legal sufficiency review.\n\nB. Conflicting Evidence\nHN16 It is the province of the jury to resolve conflicts in the evidence. 101 [**45]\nAccordingly, courts reviewing all the evidence in a light favorable to the verdict must\nassume that jurors resolved all conflicts in accordance with that verdict. 102\nAgain, this has always been the case even in those cases using the inclusive scope of\nreview. For example, in such cases we have sometimes detailed only the evidence that\nsupported a jury’s fraud finding. 103 We have affirmed a bad-faith verdict for legal\nsufficiency despite ″significant evidence″ that the insurer acted in [*821] good faith.\n104\n    We have found some evidence of lost profits, even though income tax returns\nshowed the contrary. [**46] 105 And we have affirmed a jury’s negligence finding\ndespite a defendant’s evidence asserting it could not have prevented the accident. 106\nIn none of these cases did we state that the scope of review required us to disregard\nevidence contrary to the verdict; instead, we started by considering the entire record in\neach. But in each case we either discounted or never mentioned conflicting evidence\ncontrary to the verdict because viewing the evidence in the light favorable to the verdict\nrequired us to do so.\n99\n      Bentley v.

LEXIS 436, **46\n\n\n\nOf course, it is not always clear whether evidence is conflicting. HN17 Evidence is not\nconflicting just because the parties cannot agree to it. For example, evidence that a\nhospital controlled a doctor’s rotation and patient assignments raises no material conflict\nwith evidence that a different entity controlled the details of medical treatment, as only\nthe latter is material in a malpractice case. 107 Similarly, evidence showing the terms of\none loan does not conflict with undisputed evidence that the parties never reached an\nagreement [**47] regarding the terms of another. 108\n\nBut in every circumstance in which reasonable jurors could resolve conflicting evidence\neither way, reviewing courts must presume they did so in favor of the prevailing party,\nand disregard the conflicting evidence in their legal sufficiency review.\n\nC. Conflicting Inferences\nHN18 Even if evidence is undisputed, it is the province of the jury to draw from it\nwhatever inferences they wish, so long as more than one is possible and the jury must\nnot simply guess. Thus, in product liability cases jurors may find evidence of a defect\nfrom subsequent modifications, even if there were plenty of other reasons for the\nchanges. 109 Even if a defendant admits approaching an intersection from the wrong way\non a one-way street, jurors may infer the plaintiff failed to keep a proper lookout,\n [**48] as that is one possible inference from the accident itself. 110 Similarly, jurors\nmay infer that relatives tore down posters of a missing child to assist the child’s father,\neven though another inference was that the signs simply embarrassed them. 111\n\nAccordingly, courts reviewing all the evidence in a light favorable to the verdict must\nassume jurors made all inferences in favor of their verdict if reasonable minds could,\nand disregard all other inferences in their legal sufficiency review.\n\nIV. Reconciling the Standards\n\nHaving noted the dual lines of authority stating the scope of no-evidence review, and the\nproper application and exceptions to each, [**49] we turn to the question of which one\nis correct. For the reasons [*822] discussed below, we believe the answer is both.\n\nA. Goals: The Standards Must Be The Same\n107\n      St. Joseph Hosp. v. Wolff, 94 S.W.3d 513, 542-43, 46 Tex. Sup. Ct.

LEXIS 436, **49\n\n\n\nHN19 Whether a court begins by reviewing all the evidence or disregarding part in a\nlegal-sufficiency review, there can be no disagreement about where that review should\nend. If the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in\ntheir conclusions, then jurors must be allowed to do so. 112 [**50] A reviewing court\ncannot substitute its judgment for that of the trier-of-fact, so long as the evidence falls\nwithin this zone of reasonable disagreement. 113\n\nSimilarly, there is no disagreement about how a reviewing court should view evidence\nin the process of that review. HN20 Whether a reviewing court starts with all or only\npart of the record, the court must consider evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it. 114 [**51] But if\nthe evidence allows of only one inference, neither jurors nor the reviewing court may\ndisregard it. 115\n\nGiven these premises, it is no coincidence that the two standards should reach the same\nresult -- indeed they must. Any scope of appellate review smaller than what reasonable\njurors could believe will reverse some verdicts that are perfectly reasonable; any scope\nof review larger than what reasonable jurors could believe will affirm some verdicts that\nare not.\nFurther, HN21 the two must coincide if this Court is to perform its constitutional duties.\nAlthough factual sufficiency has been the sole domain of the intermediate appellate\ncourts in Texas since 1891, our jurisdiction has always included legal sufficiency, as\n\n112\n      See Tarrant Reg’l Water Dist. v.

As discussed more fully below, reasonable people may disagree about\nwhat reasonable jurors could or must believe. But once those boundaries are settled, any\nstandard of review must coincide with those boundaries -- affirming jury verdicts based\non evidence within them and reversing jury verdicts based on evidence that is not. Any\nstandard that does otherwise is improperly applied.\n\nB.

Accordingly, the test for legal\nsufficiency should be the same for summary judgments, directed verdicts, judgments\nnotwithstanding the verdict, and appellate no-evidence review.\n\nOur statements of the standard for reviewing a directed verdict present the same mixed\nbag found with general no-evidence review. We have most often used the exclusive\nstandard, stating that courts reviewing directed verdicts must consider only evidence\nsupporting the nonmovant’s case and disregard all contrary evidence. 117 But we have\nalso stated that reviewing courts should use the inclusive standard, considering all the\nevidence in a light contrary to the directed verdict.

Here, there is only one standard -- a reviewing\ncourt must examine the entire record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,\nindulging every reasonable inference and resolving any doubts against the motion. 124\nReviewing courts do not disregard the evidence supporting the motion; [*825] if they\ndid, all summary judgments would be reversed.\n\nIn practice, however, a different scope of review applies when a summary judgment\nmotion is filed without [**58] supporting evidence. 125 In such cases, evidence\nsupporting the motion is effectively disregarded because there is none; under the rule,\nit is not allowed. Thus, although a reviewing court must consider all the summary\njudgment evidence on file, in some cases that review will effectively be restricted to the\nevidence contrary to the motion.\n\nThe standards for taking any case from the jury should be the same, no matter what\nmotion is used. If only one standard were proper, we would not expect both to appear\nin cases reviewing directed verdicts, judgments notwithstanding the verdict, and\nsummary judgments. But both do.\n\nC. Federal Courts: The Standards Are The Same\n\nThe federal courts have had a similar split of authority between the inclusive and\nexclusive standards for scope of review.

Those\n      decisions holding that review under Rule 50 should be limited to evidence\n      favorable to the nonmovant appear to have their genesis in Wilkerson v. McCarthy\n      128\n         . In Wilkerson, we stated that ″in passing upon [**60] whether there is\n      sufficient evidence to submit an issue to the jury we need look only to the\n      evidence and reasonable inferences which tend to support the case of″ the\n      nonmoving party. 129 But subsequent decisions have clarified that this passage\n      was referring to the evidence to which the trial court should give credence, not the\n      evidence that the court should review. In the analogous context of summary\n      judgment under Rule 56, we have stated that the court must review the record\n      ″taken as a whole.″ And the standard for granting summary judgment ″mirrors″\n      the standard for judgment as a matter of law, such that ″the inquiry under each is\n      the same.″ It therefore follows that, in entertaining a motion for judgment as a\n       [*826] matter of law, the court should review all of the evidence in the record.\n      130\n\n\n [**61] We address the Supreme Court’s conclusion as to the most appropriate standard\nbelow; the relevant point here is its conclusion that differences between the inclusive\nand exclusive standards are more semantic than real.\n\nD. Objections: The Standards Are Not The Same\n\nWhile we have used the two standards for the scope of review interchangeably for many\nyears in many different contexts, several arguments suggest they are not the same.\n\nFirst, the courts of appeals often use the two standards in illustrations of the difference\nbetween legal and factual sufficiency, with the exclusive standard tied to the former and\nthe inclusive standard to the latter:\n\n      When [reviewing] legal sufficiency, we consider only the evidence and inferences\n      that tend to support the award of damages and disregard all evidence and\n      inferences to the contrary. . . . When we review factual sufficiency, we consider\n      and weigh all of the evidence and will set aside the verdict only if it is so against\n128\n      336 U.S. 53, 93 L. Ed. 497, 69 S.

As demonstrated\nin Parts II and III above, it is generally true that the result of legal-sufficiency review\nis to disregard contrary evidence, but there are exceptions when a reviewing court\ncannot. It is not surprising that in drawing the general distinction between legal and\nfactual sufficiency, courts have not complicated that distinction by listing the several\nexceptions in which the scope of review -- though not the standard of review -- may\noverlap.\nSecond, it has been argued that the exclusive standard ″is an important prophylactic″\nagainst invasion of the jury’s province, as appellate judges are less likely to consider\ncontrary evidence when they should not if the exclusive standard is used. 133 But if that\n [**63] is true, the opposite should also be the case -- appellate courts are less likely\nto consider contrary evidence when they must (as shown in Part II) if the exclusive\nstandard is used. No matter which standard is used, appellate courts must take care not\nto consider or disregard too little or too much.\n[*827] Conversely, several factors appear to favor application of the inclusive standard.\nFirst, when we have said ″we must look only at that evidence which tends to support the\njudgment,″ 134 we could not have been speaking literally; no glasses filter evidence, and\njudges cannot abandon such judgments to law clerks or litigants.

As a practical matter, a\ncourt cannot begin to say what evidence supports a verdict without reviewing it all.\n[**65] Second, an appellate court that begins by disregarding one party’s evidence may\nstrike many citizens as extending something less than justice for all. Concerns about\nopen government and open courts suggest an appellate process that considers all the\nevidence, though deferring to the jury’s verdict. While there is some dispute whether\nLady Justice should wear a blindfold, 137 the metaphor was surely never intended to\nsuggest that justice disregards the facts.\nIn sum, the exclusive standard is helpful in recognizing the distinctive roles of judge and\njury, intermediate and supreme court. By contrast, the inclusive standard is helpful in\nrecognizing what courts actually do, and must be seen to do. Both are important; we\nshould avoid choosing between them if we can.\n\nE. Conclusion: The Standards Are The Same\nAs both [**66] the inclusive and exclusive standards for the scope of legal-sufficiency\nreview have a long history in Texas, as both have been used in other contexts to review\nmatter-of-law motions, as the federal courts have decided the differences between the\ntwo are more semantic than real, and as both -- properly applied -- must arrive at the\nsame result, we see no compelling reason to choose among them.\nThe key qualifier, of course, is ″properly applied.″ HN22 The final test for legal\nsufficiency must always be whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and\nfair-minded people to reach the verdict under review. Whether a reviewing court begins\nby considering all the evidence or only the evidence supporting the verdict,\nlegal-sufficiency review in the proper light must credit favorable evidence if reasonable\njurors could, and disregard contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.\nWhile judges and lawyers often disagree about legal sufficiency in particular cases,\n [*828] the disagreements are almost always about what evidence jurors can or must\ncredit and what inferences they can or must make. It is inevitable in human affairs that\nreasonable people sometimes disagree; thus, it is also [**67] inevitable that they will\nsometimes disagree about what reasonable people can disagree about. This is not a new\nproblem; Justice Calvert noted it almost fifty years ago:\n      The rule as generally stated is that if reasonable minds cannot differ from the\n      conclusion that the evidence lacks probative force it will be held to be the legal\n137\n     See Judith Resnik, Managerial Judges, 96 HARV. L.R. 374, 382-83 (1982) (noting that images of justice appeared blindfolded only\nwithin the last four hundred years).\n\n                                                Jamie Graham Page 31 of 41\n\f                                        168 S.W.3d 802, *828; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **67\n\n\n\n      equivalent of no evidence. The application of the rule can lead to strange results.\n      It is theoretically possible, and sometimes not far from actual fact, that five\n      members of the Supreme Court will conclude that the evidence supporting a\n      finding of a vital fact has no probative force, and in reaching the conclusion\n      through application of the rule will thus hold, in effect, that the trial judge who\n      overruled a motion for instructed verdict, the twelve jurors who found the\n      existence of the vital fact, the three justices of the Court of Civil Appeals who\n      overruled a ″no evidence″ point of error and four dissenting justices of the\n      Supreme Court are not men 138 [**68] of ″reasonable minds.″ 139\nIt is not hubris that occasionally requires an appellate court to find a jury verdict has no\nreasonable evidentiary basis. As Justice Frankfurter stated long ago:\n      Only an incompetent or a wilful judge would take a case from the jury when the\n      issue should be left to the jury. But since questions of negligence are questions of\n      degree, often very nice differences of degree, judges of competence and\n      conscience have in the past, and will in the future, disagree whether proof in a\n      case is sufficient to demand submission to the jury. The fact that [one] thinks there\n      was enough to leave the case to the jury does not indicate that the other [is]\n      unmindful of the jury’s function. The easy but timid way out for a trial judge is\n      to leave all cases tried to a jury for jury determination, but in so doing he fails in\n      his duty to take a case from the jury when the evidence would not warrant a\n      verdict by it. A timid judge, like a biased judge, is intrinsically a lawless judge.\n      140\n\n\n\n [**69] V. Application to the Facts\nIt remains to apply the scope of review to the facts presented.\nA majority of the court of appeals affirmed the verdict for the Wilsons, finding legally\nsufficient evidence that the City knew increased flooding on the Wilsons’ property was\nsubstantially certain to occur. 141 The majority pointed to the following proof. First, the\n\n\n138\n      Justice Calvert’s use of the masculine in 1960 may perhaps be forgiven, for although Hattie Hennenberg, Hortense Ward, and Ruth\nBrazzil served temporarily on this Court in 1925, and Sarah T. Hughes was appointed as a state district judge ten years later, it was not\nuntil 1954 that the Texas Constitution was amended to allow women to serve as jurors, and not until 1973 that Mary Lou Robinson\nbecame the first women to serve as a state appellate judge.

LEXIS 436, **69\n\n\n\nWilsons’ expert testified that the revised plan was certain to [*829] create flooding. 142\nSecond, as the City admittedly knew that development would increase runoff and the\nSebastian ditch would channel it toward the Wilsons, so it knew ″with absolute\ncertainty″ that flooding would be the result. 143 Third, the City ″did not explain″ why\nthe Master Plan required a drainage ditch across the Wilsons’ property but the revised\nplan did not, thus allowing jurors to infer that the City knew this omission would cause\nflooding. 144\n [**70] Of course, the City did explain why it approved the new plan -- because three\nsets of engineers said the omitted ditch was unnecessary -- but the court felt compelled\nby the scope of review to disregard that evidence.\nFor several of the reasons stated earlier, we believe the court of appeals did not properly\napply the scope of review. The critical question in this case was the City’s state of mind\n-- the Wilsons had to prove the City knew (not should have known) that flooding was\nsubstantially certain. A reviewing court cannot evaluate what the City knew by\ndisregarding most of what it was told.\nMoreover,HN23 when a case involves scientific or technical issues requiring expert\nadvice (as this one does), jurors cannot disregard a party’s reliance on experts hired for\nthat very purpose without some evidence supplying a reasonable basis for doing so. 145\nHere, it was uncontroverted that three sets of engineers certified that the revised plans\nmet the City’s codes and regulations -- and thus would not increase downstream\nflooding. The same firm that drew up the original Master Plan certified the revised one;\nunless the City had some reason to know the first certification was true [**71] and the\nsecond one was false (of which there was no evidence), there was only one logical\ninference jurors could draw.\nNone of the evidence cited by the court of appeals showed the City knew more than it\nwas told by the engineers. The Wilsons’ expert testified that flooding was (in his\nopinion) inevitable, but not that the City knew it was inevitable. The Wilsons’ expert\ngave no opinion on the latter point.\nSecond, ending a ditch at a neighbor’s property line may be evidence that a defendant\nwas substantially [**72] certain of the result in some cases, but not in the context of this\n142\n      86 S.W.3d at 703, 705.\n143\n      86 S.W.3d at 705.\n144\n      86 S.W.3d at 704-05.\n145\n     Provident Am.

LEXIS 436, **72\n\n\n\none. City witnesses admitted knowing development would increase runoff at the head\nof this drainage system, but not flooding at its foot. Calculating the effect of detention\nponds and absorption in a grassy drainage ditch forty-five feet wide and over two\nhundred yards long required hydrological formulas, computer models, and mathematical\ncalculations. The omission of the ditch across the Wilsons’ property obviously raised\nconcerns that the City investigated, but was no evidence that the City knew the advice\nit received in response was wrong.\n\nThe Wilsons also point to a letter Sebastian’s attorney wrote the City demanding\nindemnity in case the new ditch flooded the Wilsons. But attorneys must protect a client\nfrom potential liability whether it is real [*830] or imagined -- and justly so. In the\nletter, the attorney never purports to be an expert in hydrology, or cite the opinions of\nanyone who was. This letter may have required the City to investigate, but again is no\nevidence it knew the advice it received was wrong. 146\n  [**73]   Our concurring colleagues believe reasonable jurors could nevertheless\ndisregard what all the engineers certified because the City had a financial incentive to\nbelieve them rather than pay the Wilsons. Of course, defendants have a financial\nincentive to avoid paying damages in every case; if that incentive alone is some\nevidence of liability, then plaintiffs create enough evidence to go to the jury every time\nthey file suit.\nBut more important, this ignores what the Wilsons had to prove -- not that the City might\nhave disbelieved the engineers’ reports, but that it did. This requires evidence of\n″objective indicia of intent″ showing the City knew identifiable harm was occurring or\nsubstantially certain to result. 147 Jurors’ doubts about the engineers’ reports or the\nCity’s motives could not supply them with objective indicia that the City knew flooding\nwould occur. Constitutional concerns about the roles of judge and jury do not allow\neither to make such evidence up.\n [**74] We agree with the court of appeals that the Wilsons presented some evidence\nthat the City damaged their property, and that in drawing up and approving drainage\nplans it was acting for a public purpose. The missing piece in the evidence here is proof\nthat the City knew the plans it approved were substantially certain to increase flooding\non the Wilsons’ properties. While the City certainly knew that fact after the flooding\nstarted, the Wilsons never pleaded or submitted to the jury any takings theory other than\nthe City’s initial approval.\n146\n     Cf.

I agree with this\nstandard and join Parts I through IV of the Court’s opinion. But I cannot join Part V,\nbecause the Court misapplies the standard that it so carefully [*831] articulates by\ncrediting evidence the jury could reasonably disregard.\nThe City of Keller’s Master Drainage Plan required it in part to condemn a 2.8-acre\ndrainage easement on the Wilson property for construction of an earthen channel\nforty-five feet wide and five feet deep that would funnel water from the adjoining\nSebastian property over the Wilson property into the Little Bear Creek Watershed. The\nCity chose not to proceed with this portion of the plan, though, claiming reliance on\nengineers’ assurances that the developers’ installation of retention ponds on neighboring\nland could prevent flooding. The drainage channel that was actually built ended at the\nedge of the Sebastian [**76] property and funneled water directly onto the Wilsons’\nland, destroying eight acres of farmland worth almost $ 300,000. The Court holds that\nthe jury was required to believe the City’s testimony that it relied on the engineers’\nassurances and thus did not know flooding was substantially certain to occur, stating that\nwhen a case requires expert testimony ″jurors cannot disregard a party’s reliance on\nexperts hired for that very purpose without some evidence supplying a reasonable basis\nfor doing so.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___. Even if this were an appropriate review standard--which\nit hasn’t been until today--I believe the jury had a reasonable basis upon which to\n                                 Jamie Graham Page 35 of 41\n\f                          168 S.W.3d 802, *831; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **76\n\n\n\ndisregard the City’s professed reliance; the City had a financial incentive to disclaim\nknowledge of the flooding, and the Wilsons presented some evidence that the City had\nindependent knowledge flooding was substantially certain to occur. In my view, the jury\nwas the proper body to weigh the witnesses’ credibility and resolve these disputed fact\nissues. I nevertheless agree that the City cannot be liable for a taking in this case because\nI believe that a city’s mere act of approving a private development plan cannot\nconstitute a [**77] taking for public use. Accordingly, I concur in the Court’s judgment\nbut not its reasoning.\nI\nQuestions of intent are generally proved only by circumstantial evidence; as the court\nof appeals in this case aptly noted, ″defendants will rarely admit knowing to a\nsubstantial certainty that given results would follow from their actions,″ and therefore\nthe jury must be ″free to discredit defendants’ protestations that no harm was intended\nand to draw inferences necessary to establish intent.″ 86 S.W.3d 693, 704. I agree with\nthe Court that the jury’s ability to disbelieve the City’s protestations is not itself\n″evidence of liability.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___. Instead, the jury’s ability to weigh the\nwitnesses’ credibility means that the City’s testimony did not conclusively establish its\nlack of liability. Because liability is not conclusively negated, we must examine the\nrecord to see if there is legally sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that\nthe City knew flooding was substantially certain to occur. I would hold that the evidence\nof intent that was presented in this case allowed the jury to draw such an inference.\nAt trial, the Wilsons presented evidence [**78] that the City had independent sources\nof knowledge that flooding was substantially certain to occur. First, they demonstrated\nthat the developers’ plan itself was flawed. Rather than incorporate a drainage ditch\nrunning across the Wilson property, as the City’s Master Plan required, the developers’\nplan ended the drainage ditch abruptly at the edge of the Wilson property. The Wilsons’\nexpert testified that the plan’s implementation would necessarily ″increase the volume\nand flow of water across the Wilson property from the rate of fifty-five cubic feet per\nsecond to ninety-three cubic feet per second.″ 86 S.W.3d at [*832] 703. Second, the\nCity was aware that water flowed across the Wilson property before the development\ncommenced, and, as the court of appeals pointed out, the City’s Director of Public\nWorks admitted that the City knew the development would increase the water’s flow\nand velocity; specifically, he testified that ″the City knew the upstream water would be\nabsorbed less and would flow faster due to the removal of trees and vegetation from the\ndevelopments and from the forty-five-foot-wide earthen channel″ that ended at the\nWilson property’s edge. Id. at 705. [**79] Finally, there was evidence that the City\nreceived a letter warning that the developers’ plan would subject the Wilson property to\nflooding.\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 36 of 41\n\f                          168 S.W.3d 802, *832; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **79\n\n\n\nWhile I believe there is some evidence that the City knew flooding was substantially\ncertain to occur, there is also some evidence that it did not. City officials testified that\nthey relied on the representations of engineers who assured them retention ponds could\nsubstitute for a drainage easement and the Wilson property would not be damaged. If the\njury accepted this evidence as true, I agree that the intent element would be negated,\nwhich would preclude the City’s takings liability. But I do not agree that the jury was\nbound to accept the City’s testimony as true. The Court itself notes that jurors ″may\nchoose to believe one witness and disbelieve another,″ and that ″courts reviewing all the\nevidence in a light favorable to the verdict thus assume that jurors credited testimony\nfavorable to the verdict and disbelieved testimony contrary to it.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___.\nThis statement mirrors our prior jurisprudence, which has long provided that a jury ″has\nseveral alternatives available when presented with conflicting evidence″ because it\n″may believe [**80] one witness and disbelieve others,″ ″may resolve inconsistencies\nin the testimony of any witness,″ and ″may accept lay testimony over that of experts.″\nMcGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 697, 30 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 96 (Tex. 1986)\n(citations omitted).\nAs the Court itself states, jurors are required to credit undisputed testimony only when\nit is ″clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible, free from contradictions and\ninconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___. The\nCity’s testimony does not meet this standard. The City Manager did testify that the City\n″would not have approved the developments unless [it was] assured that the developments\ndid not increase the velocity of water or the flow of water″ onto the neighboring\nproperty. 86 S.W.3d at 706. But the Wilsons disputed whether the City’s protestations\nwere credible, pointing out that the City had a powerful incentive to profess a lack of\nknowledge through reliance on the engineers’ assurances because it would then avoid\nthe considerable expense of compensating the Wilsons for the property that would\notherwise have been condemned under the Master Drainage Plan. See id. at 705. [**81]\nMoreover, the Court’s conclusion that juries cannot disregard a party’s reliance on\nexpert opinions is not consistent with our jurisprudence. The Court cites two cases for\nthis proposition, but neither supports the Court’s analysis; instead, both cases support\nthe conclusion that the jury, as the finder of fact, should appropriately resolve factual\ndisputes regarding a party’s reliance on hired experts. Provident Am. Ins. Co. v.\nCastaneda, 988 S.W.2d 189, 194-95, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 215, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 610 (Tex.\n1998); State Farm Lloyds v. Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d 444, 448-50, 40 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 794\n(Tex. 1997).\nIn Castaneda, a bad-faith insurance case, there was no question that the insurer had\nrelied on an expert’s assurances and thus no dispute about whether the [*833] jury\ncould have disregarded that evidence. Castaneda, 988 S.W.2d at 194-95. In that case, we\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 37 of 41\n\f                          168 S.W.3d 802, *833; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **81\n\n\n\nperformed a traditional legal sufficiency analysis and concluded there was no evidence\nthat the defendant acted in bad faith. Id. at 194. We did state that reliance on an expert’s\nopinion will not preclude a finding of bad faith if the expert’s opinion was ″unreliable\nand the insurer knew or should have known that to be the case. [**82] ″ Id. However,\nwe did not hold that the jury must credit a party’s testimony that it relied on an expert.\nWe reiterated this point in Nicolau, another bad-faith insurance case. There, the Court\nnoted ″we have never held that the mere fact that an insurer relies upon an expert’s\nreport to deny a claim automatically forecloses bad faith recovery as a matter of law,″\nand again concluded that purported ″reliance upon an expert’s report, standing alone,\nwill not necessarily shield″ the defendant from liability. Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d at 448. The\nCourt conceded that ″were we the trier of fact in this case, we may well have concluded\nthat [the insurer] did not act in bad faith,″ but concluded that the ″determination is not\nours to make″ because ″the Constitution allocates that task to the jury and prohibits us\nfrom reweighing the evidence.″ Id. at 450 (citing TEX. CONST. art. I, § 15, art. V, §§\n6, 10).\nThe same is true in this case. The jury was not required to believe that the City did not\nknow flooding was substantially certain to occur because it relied on assurances to the\ncontrary; as a reviewing Court, we should ″assume that jurors credited [**83] testimony\nfavorable to the verdict and disbelieved testimony contrary to it.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___.\nSuch credibility determinations are uniquely suited and constitutionally committed to\nthe fact finder. See TEX. CONST. art. I, § 15, art. V, § 6; see also Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d\nat 450.\n\nII\nAlthough I disagree with the Court’s conclusion that the jury was required to credit the\nCity’s testimony, I agree with its judgment in the City’s favor because, in my view, the\nCity’s mere approval of the private development plans did not result in a taking for\npublic use, as the constitutional standard requires for a compensable taking. TEX.\nCONST. art. I, § 17. The City did not appropriate or even regulate the use of the\nWilsons’ land, nor did it design the drainage plan for the proposed subdivisions. Instead,\nthe City merely approved subdivision plans designed by private developers, and that\ndesign included inadequate drainage capabilities. The City argues, and I agree, that its\nmere approval of private plans did not transfer responsibility for the content of those\nplans from the developers to the City. Municipalities review subdivision plats ″to ensure\nthat subdivisions [**84] are safely constructed and to promote the orderly development\nof the community.″ City of Round Rock v. Smith, 687 S.W.2d 300, 302, 28 Tex. Sup. Ct.\nJ. 321 (Tex. 1985); see TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE § 212.002. Such a review is intended\nto protect the city’s residents; it is not intended to transfer responsibility for a flawed\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 38 of 41\n\f                          168 S.W.3d 802, *833; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **84\n\n\n\nsubdivision design from the developers to the municipality. See, e.g., City of Round\nRock, 687 S.W.2d at 302; see also Cootey v. Sun Inv., Inc., 68 Haw. 480, 718 P.2d 1086,\n1091 (Haw. 1986) (holding that ″the permit process by which the County approves or\ndisapproves the development of a proposed subdivision reflects an effort by government\nto require the developer to meet his responsibilities under the subdivision rules,\nregulations, and laws,″ and that ″the primary responsibility of providing an adequate and\nsafe development rests with . . . the developer, and not with the County″).\nBecause the primary responsibility for a development’s design rests with the developer,\n [*834] and because the plat-approval process does not transfer such responsibility to\nthe municipality, mere plat approval cannot be a basis [**85] upon which to predicate\ntakings liability. We have held that, to be liable for a taking, a governmental entity must\n″perform certain acts in the exercise of its lawful authority . . . which resulted in the\ntaking or damaging of plaintiffs’ property, and which acts were the proximate cause of\nthe taking or damaging of such property.″ State v. Hale, 136 Tex. 29, 146 S.W.2d 731,\n736 (Tex. 1941) (emphasis added). In this case, flooding resulted from the developers’\ndefective drainage design, not from the City’s approval of the plat; thus, the City’s\napproval was not the proximate cause of the damage to the Wilson property.\nOther courts, faced with similar facts, have also concluded that a governmental entity\ncannot be liable for a taking when its only action is to approve a private development\nplan. See Phillips v. King County, 136 Wn.2d 946, 968 P.2d 871, 879 (Wash. 1998); see\nalso Pepper v. J.J. Welcome Constr. Co., 73 Wn. App. 523, 871 P.2d 601, 606 (Wash. Ct.\nApp. 1994). In Phillips, the Washington Supreme Court observed that there is no public\naspect to a private development and concluded that ″if the county or city were [**86]\nliable for the negligence of a private developer, based on approval under existing\nregulations, then the municipalities, and ultimately the taxpayers, would become the\nguarantors or insurers for the actions of private developers whose development damages\nneighboring properties.″ Phillips, 968 P.2d at 878. The court in Pepper similarly\nexamined an inverse condemnation claim based upon a county’s approval of private\ndevelopments with defective drainage plans; it, too, concluded that the county’s\napproval did not cause the resultant flooding and did not result in an unconstitutional\ntaking. Pepper, 871 P.2d at 606. The court noted that the flooding was ″not the result\nof the County appropriating or regulating their use of the land,″ and held that ″the fact\nthat a county regulates development and requires compliance with road and drainage\nrestrictions does not transform a private development into a public project.″ Id. The\ncourt concluded that because ″land use regulation of [the plaintiffs’] property did not\ncause the damages, no inverse condemnation was involved.″ Id. I am persuaded by the\nreasoning of the courts in Phillips and [**87] Pepper, and would similarly conclude\nthat the City’s plat approval in this case did not amount to an unconstitutional taking as\na matter of law.\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 39 of 41\n\f                          168 S.W.3d 802, *834; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **87\n\n\n\nThe court of appeals in this case advanced an alternative reason for affirming the trial\ncourt’s judgment, suggesting that even if the City could not be liable for merely\napproving a subdivision plat, it could nevertheless be held liable for failing to condemn\na drainage easement across the Wilson property. 86 S.W.3d at 707. The court of appeals\nstated that ″the City chose not to condemn any of the Wilson property,″ but instead\n″allowed the water flowing from the Sebastian easement to discharge, uncontrolled,\nacross the Wilson property.″ Id. As noted above, however, it was the developers’\nplan--not the City’s actions--that allowed the water to flood the Wilson property.\nBecause the City’s action did not cause the flooding, I disagree that the City’s failure\nto condemn an easement is relevant to takings liability. If the City were responsible for\nthe flooding but chose not to condemn the property, it might be subject to\ninverse-condemnation liability. See Tarrant County Reg’l Water Dist. v. Gragg, 151\nS.W.3d 546, 554, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 707 (Tex. 2004) [**88] (″When the government\ntakes private property without first paying for it, the owner may recover damages for\ninverse condemnation.″). However, if a governmental entity’s actions are not the [*835]\n″proximate cause of the taking or damaging″ of the property, then the entity cannot be\nliable for a taking. Hale, 146 S.W.2d at 736. Accordingly, the entity need not condemn\nproperty merely because a private entity is causing damage. This rule does not leave\nowners of flooded property without a remedy; when a private development floods\nneighboring land, the owner of the damaged property will ordinarily have recourse\nagainst the private parties causing the damage. See TEX. WATER CODE § 11.086(a), (b)\n(providing that ″no person may divert or impound the natural flow of surface waters in\nthis state . . . in a manner that damages the property of another by the overflow of the\nwater diverted or impounded″ and that ″[a] person whose property is injured by an\noverflow of water caused by an unlawful diversion or impounding has remedies at law\nand in equity and may recover damages occasioned by the overflow″). Because the\ndevelopers’ design of the plat--not [**89] the City’s approval--caused the flooding\ndamage in this case, I would hold that the City cannot be held liable for an\nunconstitutional taking under Article I, Section 17 of the Texas Constitution.\n\nIII\n\nBecause I believe the Court fails to give due regard to the jury’s right to make credibility\ndeterminations, I cannot join Part V of the Court’s opinion. But because I conclude that\nthe City’s mere act of approving a private development plan did not cause the Wilson\nproperty to be ″taken, damaged or destroyed for or applied to public use,″ TEX. CONST.\nart. I, § 17, I agree that the City cannot be held liable for a taking in this case.\nAccordingly, I concur in the Court’s judgment.\n\nHarriet O’Neill\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 40 of 41\n\f          168 S.W.3d 802, *835; 2005 Tex.

However, because there was no\nproof that identified a defect in the truck when it left the manufacturer, the expert’s\naffidavit was not sufficient to raise a fact issue.

LEXIS 74, **1\n\n\n\nI\nJack Ridgway sustained serious injuries when his two-year-old Ford F-150 pick-up\ntruck caught fire while he was driving. Ridgway was the truck’s third owner. The first\nowner drove the truck approximately 7,000 miles and installed a spotlight on the front\nleft ″A″ pillar, which is the front part of the door frame. The second owner drove the\ntruck approximately 47,000 more miles [**2] and had the truck repaired four times at\nthe Red McCombs Ford dealership in San Antonio (″Red McCombs″). Each repair\nattempted to fix a clunking noise that occurred during hard turns. Three of the four\nrepairs also involved the fuel system and attempted to improve the truck’s poor gas\nmileage. The Ridgways drove the truck for only one month before the fire, making no\nrepairs or modifications.\n\nThe fire occurred when Ridgway was driving home from work on a paved county road\nin Bandera County. Driving at or below the speed limit, he looked into the [*600]\nrear-view mirror and noticed flames curling up around the cab of the truck. Before he\ncould jump out of the truck, Ridgway sustained second-degree burns to 20 percent of his\nbody.\nRidgway and his wife Linda sued Red McCombs and Ford, alleging products liability,\nbreach of express and implied warranties, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act, and negligence. After both defendants moved for summary judgment, the\nRidgways nonsuited Red McCombs, leaving only their negligence and strict products\nliability claims against Ford. After adequate time for discovery, Ford moved for\nsummary judgment under Rule 166a(i) and alternatively [**3] under Rule 166a(c). The\ntrial court granted summary judgment without specifying on which provision it relied.\nOn appeal, a divided court of appeals affirmed the trial court’s judgment on plaintiffs’\nnegligence claim but reversed on products liability. We granted Ford’s petition for\nreview to determine whether the Ridgways presented more than a scintilla of evidence\nin support of their claim.\n\nII\nHN1 We first review the trial court’s summary judgment under the standards of Rule\n166a(i). The non-movants, here the plaintiffs, must produce summary judgment\nevidence raising a genuine issue of material fact to defeat the summary judgment under\nthat provision. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). A genuine issue of material fact exists if more\nthan a scintilla of evidence establishing the existence of the challenged element is\nproduced. Morgan v. Anthony, 27 S.W.3d 928, 929, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1172 (Tex. 2000).\nIf the plaintiffs fail to produce more than a scintilla of evidence under that burden, then\nthere is no need to analyze whether Ford’s proof satisfied the Rule 166a(c) burden.\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 4 of 10\n\f                                         135 S.W.3d 598, *600; 2004 Tex. LEXIS 74, **3\n\n\n\nHN2 A manufacturing defect exists when a product deviates, in its construction or\nquality, from the specifications or planned [**4] output in a manner that renders it\nunreasonably dangerous. Torrington Co. v. Stutzman, 46 S.W.3d 829, 844, 44 Tex. Sup.\nCt. J. 225 (Tex. 2000); Am. Tobacco Co. v. Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 434, 40 Tex. Sup.\nCt. J. 658 (Tex. 1997). A plaintiff must prove that the product was defective when it left\nthe hands of the manufacturer and that the defect was a producing cause of the plaintiff’s\ninjuries. Torrington Co., 46 S.W.3d at 844.\nIn an attempt to defeat Ford’s motion, the Ridgways presented affidavits from all three\nof the truck’s owners and from Bill Greenlees, an expert who inspected the truck after\nthe accident. The owners explained when and where they purchased the truck, how\nmany miles they drove it, and any modifications or repairs they made. In addition,\nRidgway described when he first noticed the fire, how he reacted, and the injuries he\nsustained. Greenlees explained that his expert opinion was based on his visual\ninspection of the truck after the accident, a visual comparison of a similar but\nundamaged truck, a review of Ford service manuals, and a review of the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration’s database. Based on the areas of greatest\ndamage to the truck [**5] and an indication of a ″hot spot in the left center area of the\nengine compartment,″ Greenlees concluded that the fire originated within the engine\ncompartment and opined that ″a malfunction of the electrical system in the engine\ncompartment is suspected of having caused this accident.″ Greenlees, however, declined\nto eliminate all portions of the fuel system as a possible cause of the accident and\nconceded that ″the actual cause of the fire has not been determine [sic] yet.″ Although\nGreenlees suggested that further investigation might yield a more definitive conclusion,\nparticularly [*601] if the vehicle were disassembled, the Ridgways made no motion for\nfurther testing and did not complain that the trial court failed to allow adequate time for\nor sufficient scope of discovery. 1\nHN3 When determining if more than a scintilla of evidence has been produced in\nresponse to [**6] a Rule 166a(i) motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be\nviewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.

Evidence that is so slight as to make any inference a guess is in legal\neffect no evidence. Lozano, 52 S.W.3d at 148; Browning-Ferris, Inc., 865 S.W.2d at 928.\n\nThe Ridgways produced no direct evidence of the fire’s cause, and their circumstantial\nevidence that a manufacturing defect existed in the Ford F-150 when it left the\nmanufacturer does not exceed a scintilla. Ridgway’s affidavit establishes only that a fire\noccurred, and Greenlees could say no more than that he ″suspects″ the electrical system\ncaused the fire. Because Greenlees could not rule out part of the fuel system as a\npossible cause and because there is no proof that identified a defect in the truck at the\ntime it left the manufacturer, Greenlees’ affidavit is not sufficient to raise a fact issue.\nThe Ridgways argue that this proof is nevertheless sufficient under section 3 of the Third\nRestatement of Torts, which provides:\n\n   It may be inferred that the harm sustained by the plaintiff was caused by a product\n   defect existing at the time of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific\n   defect, when the [**8] incident that harmed the plaintiff:\n   (a) was of the kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of a product defect; and\n   (b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other than the\n   product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution.\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 3 (1998). No Texas\ncourt has ever cited this section, and we do not decide today whether it reflects the law\nof this state. Even if section 3 were the law in Texas, it would generally apply only to\nnew or almost new products. Such products typically have not been modified or\nrepaired, therefore making a product defect the likely cause of an accident. The [*602]\ndrafters of the Restatement realized this limitation and noted: ″The inference of defect\nmay not be drawn . . . from the mere fact of a product-related accident. . . . Evidence\nthat the product may have been used improperly or was altered by repair people\nweakens the inference [that there was a product defect].″ Id. at reporters’ notes to cmt.\nd (citations omitted). The reporters’ notes also provide several examples to illustrate\nwhen a product defect cannot be inferred without [**9] proof of a specific defect\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 6 of 10\n\f                                       135 S.W.3d 598, *602; 2004 Tex. LEXIS 74, **9\n\n\n\nbecause of the product’s age or the presence of modifications or repairs. Compare\nWoodin v. J.C. Penney Co., 427 Pa. Super. 488, 629 A.2d 974, 976-77 (Pa. Super. Ct.\n1993) (recognizing that a product defect cannot be inferred in a freezer cord when it\nfunctioned flawlessly for eight years before catching fire), and Walker v. Gen. Elec. Co.,\n968 F.2d 116, 120 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that the mere fact that a six-year-old toaster\noven caught fire does not support an inference that a manufacturing defect exists), with\nDietz v. Waller, 141 Ariz. 107, 685 P.2d 744, 748 (Ariz. 1984) (stating that a boat that\nbroke in half after only ten hours of use gives rise to an inference of a manufacturing\ndefect). When courts have cited section 3, they have also noted this limitation on the\nRestatement’s operation. See Jarvis v. Ford Motor Co., 283 F.3d 33, 44 (2nd Cir. 2002)\n(applying a New York law similar to section 3 to excuse a plaintiff from proving a\nspecific defect, instead inferring a defect from proof that a six-day-old vehicle did not\nperform as intended); Myrlak v. Port Auth., 157 N.J. 84, 723 A.2d 45, 56 (N.J. 1999)\n(adopting [**10] section 3 in a case involving a collapsed five-week-old chair).\nTherefore, we reiterate that because section 3 is not applicable to the facts of this case,\nwe need not decide if it is an accurate statement of Texas law.\n\nIII\nUnder the circumstances of this case, the Ridgways’ summary judgment proof is no\nmore than a scintilla of evidence that a manufacturing defect was present when the truck\nleft the manufacturer. Therefore, the Ridgways have not met their burden of showing\nthat a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding a manufacturing defect.

LEXIS 74, **10\n\n\n\nrule of section 3 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability does not\naccurately restate Texas law.\n    [**11] Section 3 states:\n\n      Circumstantial Evidence Supporting Inference of Product Defect\n      It may be inferred that the harm sustained by the plaintiff was caused by a product\n      defect existing at the time of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific\n      defect, when the incident that harmed the plaintiff:\n      (a) was of a kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of product defect; and\n      (b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other than [*603]\n      product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution. 2\n\n″It may be inferred″ cannot mean ″it is always proper to infer″, as the present case\ndemonstrates. Section 3(a) requires only that an injury-causing incident be the kind of\nthing that ordinarily results from a product defect, not that the incident is the kind of\nthing that ordinarily does not result unless there is a defect. A pickup suddenly bursting\ninto flame for no discernible reason is the kind of thing that ordinarily occurs as a result\nof product defect in the sense that product defects do cause such things. Thus Ridgway\nhas satisfied section 3(a), even though it is also true that fires in vehicles ordinarily\noccur for many reasons other than [**12] product defect. 3 As for section 3(b), although\nRidgway cannot conclusively negate that the fire was caused solely by something other\nthan a defect, Ford cannot point to anything as the sole cause of the fire. Therefore,\nRidgway argues, section 3 entitles him to an inference that his pickup was defective and\nthe further inference that the defect existed when Ford sold the pickup. The Court rejects\nRidgway’s argument, not because of the text of the rule, but because comment d to\nsection 3, the reporter’s notes, and cases allowing proof of products liability by\ncircumstantial evidence limit the stated rule. In other words, the section 3 rule means\nmuch less than it appears to say.\n    [**13] ″It may be inferred″ really means ″it is sometimes proper to infer″, but while\nthis reading makes the rule stated in section 3 accurate, it also makes the rule not very\nhelpful. Few would question the use of circumstantial evidence to prove products\nliability in appropriate cases. The hard issue is not whether it can be done, but when and\nhow. The comments to section 3 and the cases cited in support of it illustrate the kinds\n2\n     RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 3 (1998).\n3\n    See U.S. FIRE ADMINISTRATION, HIGHWAY VEHICLE FIRES, 2 TOPICAL FIRE RESEARCH SERIES No. 4 (July 2001,\nrevised Mar. 2002) (reporting that highway vehicle fires are due 66% to mechanical or design problems 18% to incendiary or suspicious\norigins, 8% to misuse, 4% to operational deficiency, and 3% to other design, construction, and installation deficiencies), available at\nhttp://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v2i4.pdf (last visited Feb. 5, 2004).\n\n                                                 Jamie Graham Page 8 of 10\n\f                                        135 S.W.3d 598, *603; 2004 Tex. LEXIS 74, **13\n\n\n\nof considerations courts have taken into account in deciding whether to allow an\ninference of pre-sale defect in a product, but these considerations are not reflected the\nin the black-letter rule itself.

Sections 3(a) and (b) are\nless strict than the parallel provisions in sections 328D(1)(a) and (b), at least in a case\nlike the present one. It cannot be said that fires in pickups do not ordinarily occur absent\na product defect; they ordinarily occur for all sorts of reasons. 6 Nor has Ridgway\n″eliminated by evidence″ the existence of other responsible causes of the fire. The most\nhe can say is that Ford has offered no evidence of another cause. He has not shown that,\ngiven the circumstances, another cause was impossible or even improbable. If section\n3 were as strictly worded as section 328D, Ridgway’s claim would clearly fail.\nTexas law of res ipsa loquitur is at least as strict as section 328D. We require the first\ncondition stated in section 328D(1)(a), and instead of the second condition stated in\nsection 328D(1)(b), we require that the instrumentality causing harm have been under\nthe defendant’s management and control. 7 We have explained that\n4\n    Proceedings at 72nd Annual Meeting: American Law Institute, 72 A.L.I.

It is sufficient if the defendant was\n     in control at the time that the negligence inferable from the first factor probably\n     occurred, so that the reasonable probabilities point to the defendant and support\n     a reasonable inference that he was the negligent party.

Summary judgment in\nappellee’s favor was entered on the grounds that the oral contract was unenforceable\nunder Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code Ann. § 26.01(b)(6), because it could not be performed\nwithin one year from the date of the agreement. Appellant sought the court’s review. The\ncourt held that § 26.01(b)(6) referred to agreements which could not be performed\nwithin one year of their making. But if the occurrence of some other contingent event\nwould terminate the agreement before it had been fully performed, then the possibility\n                                       Jamie Graham\n\f                        917 S.W.2d 506, *506; 1996 Tex.

Here, the contract required appellant to\nwork for a month and a half before becoming entitled to payments. That time period\nthen necessarily expired within one year of the agreement’s making. Further, the length\nof time the payments were to occur could also have been fully performed within one\nyear. Accordingly, § 26.01(b)(6) was not applicable. Judgment reversed and remanded.\n\nOutcome\n\nSummary judgment in appellee’s favor reversed and remanded where the oral contract\nbetween appellant and appellee was not required to be in writing to be enforceable\nwhere performance of the contract was contingent upon an event which necessarily had\nto occur within a year of the contract’s making, and where the time for performance\ncould have been fully performed within one year.\n\nLexisNexis® Headnotes\n\n  Civil Procedure > Appeals > Summary Judgment Review > General Overview\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Summary Judgment > Entitlement as Matter of Law > General\n  Overview\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Summary Judgment > Entitlement as Matter of Law > Genuine\n  Disputes\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Summary Judgment > Entitlement as Matter of Law > Materiality of\n  Facts\n\nHN1 On appeal from the granting of summary judgment, the court must determine\nwhether the evidence establishes as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact. In deciding whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the evidence\nmust be viewed in favor of the nonmovant, resolving all doubts and indulging all\ninferences in his favor.

Code Ann. § 26.01(b)(6) provides that, to be enforceable,\npromises or agreements which are not to be performed within one year from the date of\nmaking the agreement must be in writing. Agreements which demand performance at or\nfor a specified amount of time are easily determined by the court to fall or not fall under\nthe strictures of §26.01(b)(6). The court simply compares the date of the agreement to\nthe date when the performance under the agreement is to be completed and if there is\na year or more in between them then a writing is required to render the agreement\nenforceable. Agreements where the time at or for performance is not specifically\nprovided but can be readily ascertained from the context of the agreement can also be\neasily determined to be within or outside § 26.01(b)(6).\n\n  Contracts Law > Procedural Matters > Statute of Frauds > General Overview\n  Contracts Law > ... > Statute of Frauds > Requirements > General Overview\n  Contracts Law > ... > Statute of Frauds > Requirements > Performance\n  Labor & Employment Law > Employment Relationships > Employment Contracts > Statute\n  of Frauds\n\nHN3 Without knowing definitely when performance is to be completed, courts are\nunable to determine with certainty whether the agreement is to be performed within one\nyear from the date of making the agreement. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code Ann. §\n26.01(b)(6). Courts, however, apparently in an effort to avoid the harsh consequences §\n26.01(b)(6) can produce, generally hold that, in the absence of a known date when\nperformance will be completed, the statute of frauds as contained in § 26.01(b)(6) does\nnot apply if performance could conceivably be completed within one year of the\nagreement’s making.\n\n  Contracts Law > Procedural Matters > Statute of Frauds > General Overview\n  Contracts Law > ... > Statute of Frauds > Requirements > General Overview\n  Contracts Law > ... > Statute of Frauds > Requirements > Performance\n  Labor & Employment Law > ... > Conditions & Terms > Duration of Employment > General\n  Overview\n  Labor & Employment Law > Employment Relationships > Employment Contracts > Statute\n  of Frauds\n\nHN4 Agreements requiring performance for an indefinite duration and which do not\ndepend upon any conditions for their perpetuation are generally held not to require a\nwriting under the statute of frauds, Tex.

Bus.\n& Comm. Code Ann. § 26.01(b)(6) does not apply. But if the occurrence of some other\ncontingent event, even if expressly contemplated in the agreement, would simply\nterminate the agreement before the agreement had been fully performed, then the\npossibility of that terminating event occurring within one year of the agreement’s\nmaking is insufficient to take the agreement outside of § 26.01(b)(6).

We reverse and remand.\nThe two parties differ widely in their versions of the events which led to this lawsuit.\nAccording to Young, beginning in 1956 and continuing until the end of October 1985,\nYoung worked for Ward as an office manager and bookkeeper. Starting [**2] in or about\n1969, he began to feel concerned that Ward had not yet established some provision for\nhis retirement income. He, therefore, brought the subject up to Ward, who assured\nYoung that he had no need to be concerned about a lack of a retirement income and that\nWard would provide one for Young when the time came. Nevertheless, despite repeated\nprotests from Young, Ward never attempted to finalize a formal agreement with Young\nuntil either late September or early October of 1985 when Young was only a few weeks\nfrom his last day of employment. At that time, again according to Young, Ward offered\nto pay Young $ 2000 per month for the rest of Young’s life. Young argues that the\nconsideration for the agreement was that Young would continue to work for Ward until\nthe end of October. The negotiations were oral and the agreement was never reduced to\nwriting.\nWard agrees that Young worked for him from 1956 until the end of October 1985 as an\noffice manager and bookkeeper, but this essentially is where the similarity between his\nstory and Young’s ends. According to Ward, his decision to offer Young a pension arose\nfrom an effort to keep Young in his employment when Ward was relocating [**3] his\noffices from Corsicana to Dallas sometime between 1971 and 1973, not from concerns\nexpressed by Young about a lack of a retirement plan. Young did not want to move to\nDallas and was reluctant to commute; accordingly, in an effort to persuade him to\ncontinue in his employment, Ward offered to provide Young a company car and gas so\nthat Young could make the commute from Corsicana without any financial expense.\nFurthermore, as an added incentive, Ward decided to offer Young a retirement plan.\nWard consulted an insurance agent, Gara Stark, who analyzed certain figures and\noffered certain suggestions to Ward on what might be feasible Options for him and\nYoung. Ward decided not to accept any of the suggestions from Stark; instead, he orally\noffered to pay Young $ 2000 per month for eight years once Young retired. According\nto Ward, Young orally accepted this offer in 1973, but it was never reduced to writing.\n                                 Jamie Graham Page 5 of 12\n\f                        917 S.W.2d 506, *507; 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 900, **3\n\n\n\nThe parties agree that Young retired at the end of October 1985 and that Ward paid\nYoung $ 2000 per month for eight years following Young’s retirement. Young brought\nhis lawsuit when Ward informed him in or about October 1993 that he would cease\nmaking payments to Young the following [**4] month.\nIn his motion for summary judgment, Ward contended the oral agreement between him\nand Young was unenforceable because it was not to be performed within one year from\nthe date of the making of the agreement, as provided in our state’s statute of frauds.\nTEX. BUS. & COMM. CODE ANN. § 26.01(b)(6). Ward raised two arguments in\nsupport of his theory: first, he contended that any contract for lifetime is, per se, barred\nby the statute of frauds; second, he argued that, since the date of the contract’s making\nwas in 1973, more than one year would necessarily have had to elapse before the\ncontract could be performed because Young was not due to retire until twelve years later\nin 1985. The trial court granted summary judgment solely on the former argument;\nconsequently, we can only consider it and not the latter. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v.\nS.S., 858 S.W.2d 374, 380 (1993); McDuff v. Chambers, 895 S.W.2d 492, 497 (Tex.\nApp.--Waco 1995, writ denied).\nHN1 On appeal from the granting of summary judgment, we must determine whether\nthe evidence establishes as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of material fact.\nRodriguez v. Naylor, 763 S.W.2d 411, 413 (Tex. [**5] 1989); Hamlin v. Gutermuth, 909\nS.W.2d 114, 116 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1995, writ denied). In deciding\nwhether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the evidence must be viewed in [*508]\nfavor of the nonmovant, resolving all doubts and indulging all inferences in his favor.\nNixon v. Mr. Property Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985). A defendant\nas a movant must either: 1) disprove at least one element of each of the plaintiff’s\ntheories of recovery; or 2) plead and conclusively establish each essential element of an\naffirmative defense. City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 679\n(Tex. 1979). Ward in his summary judgment motion raised the affirmative defense of the\nstatute of frauds. The question before us, then, is whether oral lifetime contracts are\nunenforceable under the statute of frauds. We conclude that they are not.\nConstruing the facts in the light most favorable to Young, we find that in late September\nor early October 1985 Ward offered to pay Young $ 2000 per month for the rest of\nYoung’s life if Young would continue to work for Ward until the end of October 1985.\nYoung accepted the offer, but the agreement [**6] was never reduced to writing.\nHN2 Section 26.01(b)(6) of the Business and Commerce Code provides that, to be\nenforceable, promises or agreements ″which [are] not to be performed within one year\nfrom the date of making the agreement″ must be in writing.

BUS. & COMM. [**10] CODE ANN. § 26.01(b)(6). Texas courts,\nhowever, apparently in an effort to avoid the harsh consequences section 26.01(b)(6) can\nproduce, have generally held that, in the absence of a known date when performance\nwill be completed, the statute of frauds does not apply if performance could conceivably\nbe completed within one year of the agreement’s making.

In Wright v. Donaubauer,\n137 Tex. 473, 154 S.W.2d 637 (1941), the Supreme Court considered whether an oral\nagreement providing for an alternative means of performing on a ten-year note was\nwithin the statute of frauds. The parties orally agreed that the debtor could pay off his\n$ 2100 debt, payable on the note by $ 100 every six months for ten years, by performing\nyard work either for the life of the creditor or for the duration of the note, whichever\nshould occur first. 154 S.W.2d at 638. The parties intended that the note, under either\nscenario, would be paid in full. See id. It is important to distinguish the two agreements\nat issue in the Wright case. The first is the written [**14] agreement represented in the\nten-year note. The second is the oral agreement between the parties providing for an\nalternative means of paying off the note other than the tendering of $ 100 every six\nmonths for ten years. Under the oral agreement, the parties intended for two alternative\nmeans of performance. The first required ten years of yard work by the debtor; the\nsecond required the performance of yard work by the debtor until the death of the\ncreditor. The Supreme Court held that, because the second means of performance could\nhave occurred within one year of the agreement’s making, the statute of frauds did not\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 9 of 12\n\f                        917 S.W.2d 506, *510; 1996 Tex.

Gilliam, 340 S.W.2d at 28-9; Chevalier, 213 S.W.2d at\n532. Section 26.01(b)(6) refers to agreements which cannot be ″performed″ within one\nyear of their making. TEX. BUS. & COMM. CODE ANN. § 26.01(b)(6). Accordingly,\nHN7 if an [**18] agreement could be fully ″performed″ within one year of its making,\nsection 26.01(b)(6) does not apply. Bratcher, 346 S.W.2d at 796; Gilliam, 340 S.W.2d at\n28-9; Chevalier, 213 S.W.2d at 532; Gerstacker, 884 S.W.2d at 851 (employment\ncontract for as long as the employee’s performance was satisfactory would be fully\ncompleted when employee’s performance became unsatisfactory); Portilla, 836 S.W.2d\nat 670-71 (same). But if the occurrence of some other contingent event, even if\nexpressly contemplated in the agreement, would simply terminate the agreement before\nthe agreement had been fully performed, then the possibility of that terminating event\noccurring within one year of the agreement’s making is insufficient to take the\nagreement outside of section 26.01(b)(6). The event that could conceivably occur within\none year of the agreement must be one intended by the parties to result in the full\nperformance of the agreement. In the words of the Fifth Circuit, ″If an oral . . .\nagreement can cease upon some contingency, other than by some fortuitous event or the\ndeath of one of the parties, the agreement may be performed within one year, and the\nstatute of frauds does [**19] not apply.″ Pruitt v. Levi Strauss & Co., 932 F.2d 458,\n463-64 (5th Cir. 1991); see Gilliam, 340 S.W.2d at 29-30; Chevalier, 213 S.W.2d at 532;\nCollins, 871 S.W.2d at 934; M.R.S. Datascope, 745 S.W.2d at 544. We will now apply\nthe facts to the above-stated principles of law.\nHere, the summary judgment evidence indicates that the parties agreed in late\nSeptember or early October 1985 that Ward would pay Young $ 2000 per month for the\nrest of Young’s life if Young would work for Ward until the end of October 1985. We\nnote that there are two stages of performance under this agreement. The first is the\nmonth and a half of work Young would have to complete in order to be entitled to\npayment from Ward. The parties identified a specific and definite period of time by\nwhich performance under this first stage would be completed; i.e., no more than a month\nand a half. This month and a half would necessarily expire within one year of the\nagreement’s making; therefore, the writing requirement of section 26.01(b)(6) is not\ninvoked by this stage.\nThe second stage of performance is the period of time Ward was required to make\npayments to Young. This period was one of an [**20] indefinite duration; i.e., until\n                                 Jamie Graham Page 11 of 12\n\f                       917 S.W.2d 506, *511; 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 900, **20\n\n\n\nYoung dies. As an agreement of indefinite duration, we must ask whether it could have\nbeen fully performed within one year of its making. Obviously, it could have been.\nYoung could have died at any time after he ceased working for Ward.\nWe must also ask, however, whether Young’s death would have resulted in the\nagreement being fully performed or fortuitously terminated. The language of the [*512]\nagreement reveals the parties’ intention that the contract would be fully performed once\nYoung died, assuming he successfully performed under the first stage of the agreement,\nwhich we note was less than one year. Young’s death within a year of the agreement’s\nmaking would not have simply resulted in the fortuitous termination of the agreement:\nYoung’s death was intended by the parties to be the defining event which would\ndetermine when the agreement was fully performed. Therefore, because both stages of\nthe agreement, taken together, could have been fully performed within one year of the\nagreement’s making, we conclude that section 26.01(b)(6) is not applicable. We,\naccordingly, sustain Young’s first point of error. Due to our disposition of his first\n [**21] point of error, we need not consider his remaining points. The cause is reversed\nand remanded for a trial on the merits.\nBOBBY L.

The\n\nChristophers filed their Second Amended Petition for Breach of Oral Contract and\n\nFor Promissory Estoppel on February 20, 2014. CR 26-30.\n\n       The final hearing of this matter was held on February 24, 2014, which\n\nincluded Appellant’s motion to dismiss on the basis of the statute of frauds.

The\n\n\n1\n In this Brief, the Clerk’s Record is cited as “CR,” and the Reporter’s Record from the hearing\non February 24, 2014 is cited as “RR.”\n\n                                                6\n\fMotion for New Trial was denied after hearing on September 25, 2014. CR 130-\n\n131. Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal on October 21, 2014. CR 132-134.\n\n                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      In the summer of 2012, the Christophers’ daughter, Adria Simcoe, was\n\nexpecting her fourth child with her then-husband, Brian Simcoe.          RR 43:13.\n\nDesiring to help the Simcoe family, it is undisputed that the Christophers purchased\n\na 2010 Chrysler Town and Country (hereafter “the Van”) and a Jeep, intending for\n\nthese vehicles to be used by the growing Simcoe family. RR 37:11-15; 43:19-25. It\n\nis undisputed that at the time the Van was purchased by the Christophers, the\n\nSimcoes’ credit score precluded them from acquiring financing for the Van in their\n\nown names. RR 12:23-25; 13:1-4. It is undisputed that the Christophers signed a\n\nfive-year note for the Van. RR 21:9-13. It is undisputed while the Van was in the\n\npossession of the Simcoes, the Simcoes made the monthly payments for the Van.\n\nRR 14:24-25; 15:1-5.\n\n      On February 21, 2012, Adria Simcoe filed for divorce. RR 51:15-20. Shortly\n\nthereafter, Appellant returned the Van to the Christophers with a kind note\n\nexplaining that, in light of the pending divorce, he was no longer able to afford the\n\nmonthly payments. RR 16:6-13; 52:4-5. The Christophers had the Van repossessed\n\nabout one month later. RR 17:21-24. The Van was sold at auction, leaving a\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fdeficiency of $18,411.14, for which the Christophers were the named responsible\n\nparties. RR 19:7-15.\n\n      The Simcoes’ Final Decree of Divorce was signed on November 5, 2013. RR\n\n40:21-22. Nowhere in the decree is the Van mentioned as an asset or a liability of\n\nthe marital estate. CR 113-114; RR 80:21-25; 81:1-5. The Jeep was awarded to\n\nAdria Simcoe. CR 113-114.\n\n      On September 20, 2012, the Christophers filed suit against Appellant, alleging\n\nthat he breached an oral contract whereby the Christophers were to obtain the Van\n\nin their names and Appellant was to be responsible for all payments thereon. CR 1-\n\n4. The Christophers sought to hold Appellant responsible for the entire amount of\n\nthe deficiency. Id. Appellant brought his ex-wife, Adria Simcoe, into the suit as a\n\nthird-party defendant, maintaining that if he was liable, she shared joint and several\n\nliability with him as a responsible party to the alleged oral contract. CR 23-25.\n\n      At the final hearing on February 24, 2014, the Christophers alleged that the\n\nSimcoes were obligated to make the monthly payments for the Van, regardless of\n\nwhether or not the Simcoes had possession of it. Compare RR 11:24-25; 12:1-2; RR\n\n34:25; 35:1-4, with RR 60:18-22; RR 70:6-12. The Christophers further alleged that\n\nthey agreed to acquire the Van in their names, but that the Simcoes were obligated\n\nto make all payments under the five year note or to refinance the vehicle into their\n\nnames once their credit so permitted. RR 20:17-18; RR 24:13-19; RR 28:10-19.\n\n\n                                          8\n\fConversely, Appellant maintained that the Simcoes agreed only to make payments\n\nfor the Van for so long as they had possession of it. RR 60:18-22; RR 70:6-12. In\n\nother words, according to Appellant, by returning the Van to the Christophers, the\n\nSimcoes’ obligation to make payments ceased. RR 71:16-20. Appellant further\n\nargued that the time for performance, based upon the five-year note signed by the\n\nChristophers, was greater than one year. RR 67:22-25; 68:1-3. As such, the statute\n\nof frauds barred enforcement of the oral agreement because it was not in writing nor\n\nwas it signed by the parties to be bound.       RR 84:2-8.\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that the alleged oral\n\ncontract was taken outside of the statute of frauds “by virtue of the fact that [the Van]\n\ncould have been refinanced as the plan was to refinance as soon as Mr. Simcoe’s\n\ncredit improved.” RR at 85:17-21. Judgment was rendered against Appellant for\n\n$18,411.14, and an additional $5,000.00 was awarded to the Christophers for their\n\nattorney’s fees. RR 86:2-4: CR 36-37. No judgment was rendered against Appellee\n\nAdria Simcoe. RR 86:5-15; CR 36-37.\n\n      Appellant timely filed a Motion for New Trial, and a hearing on said Motion\n\nwas held on September 11, 2014. CR 83-88. Appellant requested a new trial on the\n\ngrounds that there was no evidence the alleged oral agreement could be performed\n\nor was intended to be performed within one year, and because Adria Simcoe\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fshould’ve been held jointly and severally liable.   Id. The trial court denied\n\nAppellant’s Motion for New Trial and this appeal followed. CR 131-134.\n\n\n\n\n                                      10\n\f                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n I.   Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s finding\n\n      that enforcement of the oral agreement was not barred by the statute of frauds.\n\n\nII.   Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s judgment\n\n      solely against Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS\n\n      To be enforceable, the statute of frauds requires that a contract to answer for\n\nthe debt of another, like the one at issue in this case, be in writing and signed by the\n\nparty to be bound. It is undisputed that there was not a written and signed contract\n\nbetween the Simcoes and the Christophers for the debt at issue. The statute of frauds\n\ntherefore barred enforceability of the alleged oral contract as a matter of law.\n\n      Performance of the alleged oral contract, whether by payment in full or\n\nrefinancing of the debt, was not to be completed within one year, according to the\n\ntenor of the agreement and the understanding of the parties at the time the agreement\n\nwas allegedly made. Performance within one year could only have been possible\n\nupon the occurrence of some merely fortuitous event. The evidence was legally\n\ninsufficient to support the trial court’s finding that the oral contract was enforceable\n\nbecause of the One-Year Exception to the statute of frauds.\n\n      The undisputed evidence shows that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were\n\nparties to the oral contract at issue as promisors. The terms of the oral contract did\n\nnot differentiate or apportion liability between Appellant and Adria Simcoe.\n\nAccordingly, the only theory of liability supported by the undisputed evidence\n\nbefore the trial court was joint and several liability of both Appellant and Adria\n\nSimcoe. There was legally insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s take-\n\nnothing judgment with respect to Appellee Adria Simcoe.\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                      ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n     I.      Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s\n\n             finding that enforcement of the oral agreement was not barred by the\n\n             statute of frauds.\n\nStandard of review\n\n      Whether a contract comes within the statute of frauds is a question of law,\n\nwhich is reviewed de novo.

In conducting a legal sufficiency review, the Court cannot disregard\n\nundisputed evidence that allows of only one logical inference. Id. at 814.\n\nThe statute of frauds barred enforcement of the alleged oral contract as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       The statute of frauds, as codified in Section 26.01 of the Texas Business and\n\nCommerce Code, applies to “a promise by one person to answer for the debt, default,\n\nor miscarriage of another person.”       TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(b)(2).\n\nEnforceability of such promises or agreements is barred as a matter of law unless\n\nthey are “(1) in writing; and (2) signed by the person to be charged with the promise\n\nor agreement or by someone lawfully authorized to sign for him.” TEX. BUS. & COM.\n\nCODE § 26.01(a).\n\n       The oral contract at issue in the present case falls within the purview of the\n\nstatute of frauds because the Simcoes allegedly agreed to answer for the debt of the\n\nChristophers. See RR 12:23-25; 13:1-4. Accordingly, in order to be enforceable,\n\nthe statute of frauds required that this contract be in writing and signed by the\n\nSimcoes. It is undisputed that there was not a written and signed contract between\n\nthe Simcoes and the Christophers for the debt at issue. RR 21:6-8; 52:6-9. The\n\nstatute of frauds therefore barred enforceability of the oral contract as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n\n                                         14\n\fIn order to enforce the purported oral contract, the burden was on the Christophers\n\nto show some exception to the statute of frauds.\n\n      At trial, the Christophers argued that an exception to the statute of frauds\n\napplied in this case because performance of the oral contract could have been\n\ncompleted within one year’s time (the “One-Year Exception”). RR 83:18-24. The\n\nbasis for the One-Year Exception is found in Section 26.01(b)(6) of the Texas\n\nBusiness and Commerce Code, which states that the statute of frauds does not bar\n\nenforcement of “an agreement which is not to be performed within one year from\n\nthe date of making the agreement.” The question for the trial court was whether the\n\nalleged oral contract was to be performed within one year from the date the\n\nagreement was made.\n\nCalculation of the time for performance depends on the tenor of the agreement and\n\nthe understanding of the parties at the time the agreement is made, excluding merely\n\nfortuitous events.\n\n      To determine the time for performance, the court simply compares the date\n\nthe oral agreement is made to the date when the performance under the oral\n\nagreement is to be completed, and if there is a year or more in between them, a\n\nwriting is required to render the oral agreement enforceable. Young v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1723627\"><a href=\"/opinion/1723627/young-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 508 (Tex. App.—Waco, 10th Dist. 1996). In the absence of a known\n\ndate when performance will be completed, the statute of frauds does not apply if\n\n\n                                         15\n\fperformance could conceivably be completed within one year of the agreement’s\n\nmaking. Id. at 509. Whether performance could conceivably be completed within\n\none year depends on the tenor of the agreement and the understanding of the parties\n\nat the time the agreement is made. Id. If performance within one year is dependent\n\nupon some merely fortuitous event, a writing is required to enforce the oral\n\nagreement. Id. at 510–511. If a contract explicitly calls for performance over a\n\nperiod longer than one year, the mere theoretical possibility of termination of the\n\ncontract within one year because of a fortuitous event does not take the contract out\n\nof the statute of frauds. SBC Operations, Inc. v. Business Equation, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">462</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466 (Tex. App.—San Antonio [4th Dist.] 2001).\n\nThe parties disputed what type of performance was required of the Simcoes under\n\nthe oral contract.\n\n      In the instant case, the parties presented conflicting testimony as to what type\n\nof performance was required of the Simcoes under the oral agreement. Appellant\n\ntestified that the Simcoes were only required to make payments for so long as they\n\nhad possession of the Van. RR 70:6-12; 71:16-20. The Christophers maintained\n\nthat performance would be completed when the Simcoes paid all monthly\n\ninstallment payments for the Van owing under the finance agreement signed by the\n\nChristophers, or, alternatively, when the Simcoes’ credit improved and they\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fqualified to refinance the Van into their own names. RR 20:17-18; 24:13-19; 34:25;\n\n35:1-4.\n\n      If the parties to an oral contract testify to conflicting terms, a reviewing court\n\nmust presume the terms were those asserted by the winner. City of Keller, 168\n\nS.W.3d at 819. Accordingly, the reviewing court must presume that performance\n\nunder the oral contract at issue was complete either upon payment of the debt in full\n\nby the Simcoes (“Payment Performance”), or refinance of the debt into the Simcoes’\n\nnames (“Refinance Performance”).\n\n      At trial the Christophers bore the burden of proving that either Payment\n\nPerformance or Refinance Performance could have been completed within one year\n\nin order to enforce the oral contract under the One-Year Exception to the statute of\n\nfrauds.   The proper analysis for the trial court was whether the Christophers\n\npresented sufficient evidence to show that performance could conceivably be\n\ncompleted within one year of the agreement’s making, based upon the tenor of the\n\nagreement and the understanding of the parties, and excluding the possibility of\n\nsome merely fortuitous event. See Young, 917 S.W.2d at 510–511.\n\nThe evidence is legally insufficient to show that Payment Performance could have\n\nbeen completed within one year of the making of the oral contract.\n\n      The only evidence presented to the trial court reflecting the time for\n\ncompletion of Payment Performance was the note signed by the Christophers. RR\n\n\n                                          17\n\f21:9-13; 36:1-5. By the express term of that note, there was indeed a known date\n\nwhen Payment Performance was to be completed. Payment Performance would be\n\ncompleted after five years of monthly installment payments. Id.\n\n      In conducting a legal sufficiency review, the Court cannot disregard\n\nundisputed evidence that allows of only one logical inference. City of Keller v.\n\nWilson, 168 S.W.3d at 814. In the instant case, the only logical inference to be made\n\nfrom the undisputed evidence presented to the trial court was that Payment\n\nPerformance was not to be completed within one year. While there may be some\n\nconceivable possibility that the Simcoes could have paid off the Van within one year,\n\nno evidence was presented at trial showing that was the tenor of the oral agreement\n\nor the understanding of the parties at the time the oral agreement was made. No\n\nevidence was presented to the trial court indicating the Christophers expected the\n\nSimcoes to pay off the Van within one year. To the contrary, the evidence presented\n\nto the trial court indicated that the Christophers knew that the Simcoes were\n\nstruggling financially, and could not afford to pay off the Van within one year. RR\n\n67:22-25; 68:1-3. Completion of Payment Performance within one year could only\n\nhave been possible upon the occurrence of a merely fortuitous event that transformed\n\nthe financial circumstances of the Simcoe family.\n\n      The evidence further demonstrated that the Simcoes actually made payments\n\nfor the Van for over a year, with no complaint from the Christophers or request that\n\n\n                                         18\n\fthey pay the Van off in full. RR 14:24-25; 15:1-5. The fact that over a year lapsed\n\nwithout completion of performance demonstrates that the parties never intended for\n\nthe Simcoes to pay off the Van in full within a year.\n\n      Because the written finance agreement was for a five year term and\n\ncompletion of Payment Performance within one year was only possible upon the\n\noccurrence of a merely fortuitous event, the One-Year Exception does not apply and\n\nthe statute of frauds was a complete bar to enforcement of the oral agreement in this\n\ncase. See SBC Operations, Inc., 75 S.W.3d at 466.\n\nThe evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial court’s finding that Refinance\n\nPerformance could conceivably have been completed within one year of the making\n\nof the oral agreement.\n\n      The trial court enforced the oral contract against Appellant, finding that\n\nRefinance Performance of the oral contract was to be completed within one year.\n\nRR 85:15-21. Even considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\njudgment, there is no evidence to support the trial court’s finding “that [the Van]\n\ncould have been refinanced” within a year of the agreement’s making. RR at 85:17-\n\n21. No evidence was presented at trial to show whether the Simcoes qualified to\n\nrefinance the Van into their names within a year after the alleged oral agreement was\n\nmade. Further, there was no evidence that it was the tenor of the agreement or the\n\nunderstanding of the parties at the time the agreement was made that the Simcoes\n\n\n                                          19\n\fwould refinance the Van within one year. No evidence was presented that the\n\nChristophers asked the Simcoes to refinance within one year. No evidence was\n\npresented that the Simcoes even attempted to refinance within one year.\n\n       Absent any evidence that Refinance Performance could have been or was to\n\nbe completed within one year, the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that the One Year Exception applied to the alleged oral contract at\n\nissue. Enforcement of the oral contract was barred by the statute of frauds as a matter\n\nof law.\n\n II.   Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s judgment\n\n       solely against Appellant.\n\n\n       Joint and several liability usually arises when two or more promisors in the\n\nsame contract promise the same or different performances to the same promisee.\n\nPitman v. Lightfoot, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743564\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743564/pitman-v-lightfoot/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996).\n\nObligations of multiple parties to a contract are usually joint and several. Id.\n\nThe undisputed evidence showed that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were liable\n\nunder the alleged oral contract.\n\n       The undisputed evidence presented to the trial court showed that, under the\n\nterms of the alleged oral contract sued upon, both Appellant and his then-wife,\n\nAppellee Adria Simcoe, orally promised the Christophers to pay for the Van. RR\n\n34:25; 35:1-4; 35:11-16; 43:19-25; 50:16-21. Evidence was presented that during\n\n                                          20\n\fthe divorce of Appellant and Adria Simcoe, the Jeep was awarded to Adria Simcoe\n\nand Appellant was asked to take the Van and assume all payments therefore. RR\n\n45:7-16.35:11-16. The evidence further demonstrated that Appellant could not\n\nafford to assume the Van payments individually, prompting him to return the Van to\n\nthe Christophers. RR 63:17-20.\n\n      The oral contract that the Christophers sued upon was allegedly made on that\n\ndate when the Christophers acquired the Van. RR 14:24-25; 27:22. Regardless of\n\nwhatever subsequent negotiation or agreement was allegedly made regarding the\n\nvehicles upon the divorce of Appellant and Adria Simcoe, the terms of the oral\n\ncontract as they stood on June 30, 2010 are controlling.\n\n      It is undisputed that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were parties to the oral\n\ncontract as promisors. The terms of the oral contract did not differentiate or\n\napportion liability between Appellant and Adria Simcoe.         See RR 50:16-21.\n\nAccordingly, the only theory of liability supported by the undisputed evidence\n\nbefore the trial court was joint and several liability of both Appellant and Adria\n\nSimcoe. See Pitman, 937 S.W.2d at 528. There was legally insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the trial court’s take-nothing judgment with respect to Appellee Adria\n\nSimcoe. RR 86:5-14.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n      The undisputed evidence before the trial court was that the contract the\n\nChristophers sued on was not in writing or signed by the Christophers. It was\n\ntherefore unenforceable under the statute of frauds.        There was no evidence\n\npresented to the trial court to show that the Simcoes were to refinance the Van within\n\none year. The evidence is therefore factually insufficient evidence to support the\n\ntrial court’s finding that the oral contract was enforceable under the One Year\n\nException to the statute of frauds.\n\n      The undisputed evidence shows that both Appellant and Adria Simcoe were\n\nparties to the oral contract at issue as promisors. The terms of the oral contract did\n\nnot differentiate or apportion liability between Appellant and Adria Simcoe.\n\nAccordingly, the only theory of liability supported by the undisputed evidence\n\nbefore the trial court was joint and several liability of both Appellant and Adria\n\nSimcoe. There was legally insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s take-\n\nnothing judgment with respect to Appellee Adria Simcoe.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n      Appellant Brian Simcoe respectfully prays this Court grant his appeal, and\n\nhold that enforcement of the oral contract is barred by the statue of frauds. Appellant\n\nfurther prays that this Court reverse the judgment of the trial court, and render\n\njudgment that Appellees, the Christophers, take nothing against him by way of their\n\n\n                                          22\n\fclaims. Appellant prays that, in the alternative, this Court reverse the judgment of\n\nthe trial court, and render judgment holding Appellee Adria Simcoe jointly and\n\nseverally liable for all damages and attorney’s fees awarded to Appellees, the\n\nChristophers. Appellant further prays for all other and further relief to which he may\n\nbe entitled.\n\n                                       Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                       /s/ Sarah Anne Lishman\n                                       Sarah Anne Lishman\n                                       State Bar No. 24086267\n                                       Jamie L.

This\nfine distinction matters. If Kirk desired damages to protect the economic interests of the Burbage Funeral Home, a business\ndisparagement claim provides the correct vehicle. See Forbes, 124 S.W.3d at 170. And, whether under defamation or business\ndisparagement, we require a plaintiff requesting special damages to prove those damages. See Hancock, 400 S.W.3d at 66. Here, the type\nof damages Kirk seeks, economic damages, are distinct from the noneconomic damages that are presumed in a defamation per se case.\nKirk did not plead these special damages and certainly has not proven them. Kirk could have brought business disparagement or\ndefamation claims (or both), but in any case his proof will not suffice for recovery of special damages.\n\n                                                  Jamie Graham Page 17 of 20\n\f                         </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *261; 2014 Tex.

See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(a), (b)(2).

LEXIS 679, **1\n\n\n\npay the attorney’s fees incurred by one of Dynegy’s former officers. We agree.\nAccordingly, we reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render a take-nothing\njudgment in favor of Dynegy.\n\nI. Background\nA grand jury indicted James Olis, a former officer of Dynegy, on multiple counts of\nsecurities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy arising out of work he performed\nwhile at Dynegy. [**2] Dynegy’s board of directors passed a resolution authorizing the\nadvancement of attorney’s fees for Olis’s defense provided that Olis acted in good faith,\nin Dynegy’s best interests, and in compliance with applicable law. The resolution\nprovided that it ″may be modified or revoked by this Board at any time as a result of\nchanges in circumstances or further analysis.″\nOlis hired Terry Yates, a criminal defense attorney, to defend him in the federal criminal\ninvestigation and an ongoing civil investigation conducted by the Securities and\nExchange Commission. Olis told Yates and Mark Clark, Yates’s associate, that Dynegy\nwould be paying his legal fees. Clark called Cristin Cracraft, an attorney in Dynegy’s\nlegal department, who orally confirmed that Dynegy would pay Olis’s legal fees. Clark\ntestified that Cracraft stated, ″The Board has passed a resolution, so, yes, we are paying\nJamie Olis’s fees,″ and instructed Clark that the bills should be submitted to her.\nCracraft’s trial testimony was similar to Clark’s version of the conversation. Olis signed\na written fee agreement with Yates under which Olis agreed that he was responsible for\npayment of his legal fees. The contract stated that [**3] ″all fees are due when billed\nunless other specific arrangements have been made.″ Yates testified that, despite the\nwritten fee agreement, he had an oral agreement with Olis under which Yates would\nnever look to Olis for payment of fees, but instead would look to Dynegy for payment.\nYates testified that he spoke to Cracraft after faxing his fee agreement and hourly rate\nto Dynegy and that Cracraft told him Dynegy would pay Olis’s legal fees through trial.\nCracraft contradicted Yates’s testimony about the phone call, however, stating that she\nhad spoken only to Clark and never to Yates as of the date of the trial.\nDynegy then hand-delivered a letter notifying Yates that it would pay him directly for\nOlis’s legal fees through August 17, 2003, but the remaining fees incurred were to be\npaid into escrow pursuant to a board resolution. Dynegy paid Yates’s initial invoice for\n$15,000. Yates submitted his $105,176 July bill in August, but Dynegy did not pay it\nuntil after trial in November. Olis was ultimately convicted of securities fraud, mail and\nwire fraud, and conspiracy. United States v. Olis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"39694\"><a href=\"/opinion/39694/united-states-v-olis/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (5th Cir. 2005)\n(affirming the conviction but remanding to the trial court [**4] to reconsider the proper\nsentencing guidelines).

LEXIS 679, **4\n\n\n\nNovember 2003 trial. Dynegy initially escrowed that amount pursuant to the board\nresolution, but later refused to release the escrowed funds after concluding that Olis did\nnot meet the ″good faith″ standard for indemnification as required by the board’s\nresolution.\nYates filed suit against Dynegy to recover the unpaid attorney’s fees, alleging that\nDynegy orally promised that it would pay Yates’s fees through Olis’s trial. Yates\nasserted claims for breach of contract and [*641] fraudulent inducement and sought\nbenefit-of-the-bargain damages for both claims. After a three-week trial, the jury found\nfor Yates on both claims. Yates ultimately elected to recover under his fraudulent\ninducement claim, and the trial court rendered judgment on that claim in favor of Yates.\nDynegy filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on its affirmative\ndefense of statute of frauds, which the trial court denied. Dynegy appealed.\nThe court of appeals initially reversed and rendered judgment for Dynegy based on its\n [**5] affirmative defense of statute of frauds. No. 04-10-00041-CV, 2010 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 3556, at *1 (Tex. App.—San Antonio May 12, 2010). Thereafter, the court of\nappeals denied Yates’s motion for rehearing while also issuing a revised opinion.

App.—San Antonio 2011). In its third\nopinion, the court of appeals reversed itself based on the main purpose doctrine, holding\nthat Dynegy intended to bind itself to a primary obligation rather than a promise to pay\nthe debt of another, and the statute of frauds was therefore inapplicable. Id. at 520,\n523-25. The court of appeals also reversed the trial court’s judgment based on the jury’s\nfraud finding, holding that the evidence was legally insufficient. Id. at 534. The court\nof appeals then rendered judgment for Yates on his breach of contract claim. Id. at 536.\nDynegy petitions this Court for review, arguing that the court of appeals erred by\nconsidering an element of the main purpose doctrine, which is an exception to the\nstatute of [**6] frauds, as a part of Dynegy’s initial burden on its statute of frauds\naffirmative defense. We agree.\n\nII. Analysis\nHN2 The statute of frauds generally renders a contract that falls within its purview\nunenforceable. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(a).

Once that party\nmeets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to establish an exception\nthat would take the verbal contract out of the statute of frauds. See Cobb v.

Dynegy Met its Initial Burden to Establish Applicability of the Statute of Frauds\n[*642] Here, Dynegy pled the statute of frauds as an affirmative defense and thus had\nthe initial burden to establish that the alleged promise fell within the statute of frauds.\nSee TEX.

The statute of frauds’\nsuretyship provision applies to ″a promise by one person to answer for the debt, default,\nor miscarriage [**8] of another person.″ TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(b)(2). Yates\nargues that the suretyship provision does not apply to the oral agreement in this case\nbecause there is not a preexisting debt. On the contrary, the suretyship provision applies\nregardless of ″whether [the debt was] already incurred or to be incurred in the future.″\nSee RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 112 cmt. b (1981).\nThe record indicates that Olis hired Yates to represent him in the criminal proceedings.\nOlis signed a fee agreement with Yates, in which Dynegy was not mentioned. Yates\nagreed to defend Olis, and Olis agreed in exchange that fees were due when billed\nunless other arrangements were made. Both Clark and Yates testified that Cracraft orally\npromised that Dynegy would be paying Olis’s fees through trial, and it is undisputed\nthat this agreement was never reduced to writing. These facts establish one conclusion:\nDynegy orally promised to pay attorney’s fees associated with Olis’s defense that, under\nthe fee agreement, were Olis’s obligation (i.e., Olis’s debt). The dissent, like the court\nof appeals, believes that Dynegy’s promise to pay Olis’s legal fees was a primary\nobligation and not a promise to pay [**9] another’s debts, and therefore the statute of\nfrauds does not bar Yates’s recovery on his breach of contract claim.

We hold that Dynegy\nestablished as a matter of law that the statute of frauds’ suretyship provision initially\napplied to bar the claims against it. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE § 26.01(b)(2) (providing\nthat ″a promise by one person to answer for the debt . . . of another person″ falls within\nthe statute of frauds). The court of appeals erred when it held otherwise.\n\nB. The Burden Shifted to Yates\nAt this point, the burden shifted to Yates to establish an exception that would take the\nverbal contract out of the statute of frauds—namely, the main purpose doctrine. See\nCobb, 108 S.W. at 812. The main purpose doctrine required Yates to prove: (1) Dynegy\nintended to create primary responsibility in itself to pay the debt; (2) there was\nconsideration for the promise; [**10] and (3) the consideration given for the promise\nwas primarily for Dynegy’s own use and benefit—that is, the benefit it received was\nDynegy’s main purpose for making the promise. See Cruz, 364 S.W.3d at 828. We have\nnoted that the question of intent to be primarily responsible for the debt is a question for\nthe finder of fact, taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case. See\nHaas Drilling Co. v. First Nat’l Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432429\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432429/haas-drilling-co-v-first-national-bank-in-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 889 (Tex. 1970) (citing Gulf\nLiquid Fertilizer Co., 354 S.W.2d at 384). Thus, the burden was on Yates to secure\nfavorable findings on the main purpose doctrine.1 Yates’s failure to do so constituted a\nwaiver of the issue under Rule 279 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. [*643] See\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 279; W.H. McCrory & Co., 691 S.W.2d at 720-21; cf. Woods, 769 S.W.2d\nat 518 (holding the discovery rule waived when a party neither pled nor obtained\nfindings on the issue in response to the opposing party’s limitations defense). Therefore,\nthe court of appeals erred by considering the intent element of the main purpose doctrine\nin conjunction with determining whether Dynegy met its initial burden to show\napplicability of the statute of frauds.2\n\nIII. Conclusion\nBased on the preceding analysis, we hold that the statute of frauds renders the oral\nagreement between Dynegy and Yates unenforceable. Consequently, Yates cannot\nrecover under his breach of contract claim. In addition, Yates’s claim for\nbenefit-of-the-bargain damages pursuant to his alternative fraudulent inducement action\nis barred. See Haase v. Glazner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799 (Tex. 2001) HN5 (″[T]he Statute\n1\n    Dynegy [**11] even pointed out to the trial court and Yates the omission of any jury questions related to an exception to the statute\nof frauds in its written charge objections.\n2\n    The dissent also argues that the main purpose doctrine takes Dynegy’s promise out of the statute of frauds based on Dynegy’s\nself-serving reasons for promising to pay Olis’s legal fees.

It . . . may be used to perpetrate frauds as\nwell as to prevent them. Under it a person may obtain an oral promise to pay the debt\nof a third person and then resist payment on the ground that this promise is oral and\ntherefore unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. Because of this and other dangers,\nthe courts of England and this country have sought to keep the Statute within its\nintended purpose.″1\n\nIn this case, the Court applies the Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision to, what the\njury found to be, an unconditional promise by a company to pay an attorney to defend\none of its employees from a work-related prosecution. Because I do not believe the\nStatute was intended to apply to such promises, I respectfully dissent.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision applies when a creditor seeks to recover\nfrom a guarantor because of a third person’s failure to perform.2 The provision\n [**13] discourages false allegations that a person promised to pay if the primary debtor\ncould not.3 The provision also protects [*644] those closely associated with the\nprincipal debtor from making rash or emotionally-driven oral promises before having\n″any real opportunity for awareness of the nature and magnitude of the risks\n1\n    Gulf Liquid Fertilizer Co. v.

I agree, but the inference I draw from that conclusion\nis that Dynegy assumed the role of primary obligor, not surety. As we explained in Bank\nof Garvin v. Freeman, the Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision does not bar an oral\npromise to assume primary responsibility for the debt of another:\n\n     The meaning of that statute is to require a promise as surety for another’s debt,\n     or guarantor of another’s debt, to be in writing. It never was intended to prohibit\n     one person from assuming the payment of another’s debt, as his own debt, where\n     there is a valid consideration moving between the parties to such contract. In\n     other words, one person for a valuable consideration may assume as his own debt\n     the debt of another, and it need not be in writing, but he cannot [**15] contract\n     with one person to become surety or guarantor for the debt of another person\n     except it be in writing.7\n\nHere, Dynegy does not claim that a surety relationship existed between Olis and itself.\nDynegy argues instead that the suretyship provision applies merely because Olis and\nYates entered into a written fee agreement, creating a debt. But if the creation of a debt\nwas all that was necessary to invoke the Statute of Frauds, it would not be possible to\nassume another’s debt by oral agreement, and the Court was wrong to say otherwise in\nBank of Garvin.8\n\nFor its part, Dynegy does not claim to be the guarantor of Olis’ debt. Dynegy instead\nconcedes that it agreed to pay Yates for Olis’ defense, but argues that a condition in the\nboard resolution allowed it to stop paying Yates if Dynegy’s board determined that Olis\ndid not act in good faith. At that point, according to Dynegy, Olis became responsible\nfor Yates’ fee. But the board resolution did not make Dynegy the guarantor of Olis’ debt,\nnor did it give the company the right to stop or suspend payment to the attorney\n [**16] for services already rendered. The board resolution merely stated that the\n4\n    4 BROWN, supra, § 16.1, [**14] at 317.\n5\n    See id. § 15.7, at 268 (″[I]t is enough to take the defendant’s promise out of the statute that the third person was not bound at all to\nthe promisee.″).\n6\n    See Bank of Garvin v.

The dispute instead is about the extent of Dynegy’s promise. Dynegy\ncontends that its promise to Yates was conditioned by the terms of the board resolution.\nYates contends that Dynegy’s promise to pay for Olis’ defense through trial was\nunconditional and, as to Yates, primarily the company’s responsibility.\nThe dispute was submitted to a jury, which was asked to determine the extent of\nDynegy’s agreement with Yates. The [*645] charge instructed the jury that an essential\nterm of the asserted agreement was whether Dynegy agreed to pay Yates for his legal\nservices to Olis through trial.9 In closing argument, Dynegy argued that the jury should\nnot find it in breach of the agreement unless it believed Dynegy made an unconditional\npromise to pay Yates through trial. The jury found Dynegy in breach of its agreement\nto pay Yates and awarded damages, apparently reasoning that the conditional payment\nterms of the board resolution did [**17] not apply to the oral contract between Dynegy\nand Yates.\nThe Court concludes, however, that the written fee agreement between Yates and Olis\nconclusively establishes Olis as the primary obligor, making Dynegy merely the surety\nof that obligation. Because Dynegy never intended to act as a guarantor of Olis’ debt,\nhowever, the Statute of Frauds’ suretyship provision should not apply as a matter of law.\nI therefore disagree with the Court’s conclusion, but even if I agreed with it, I would\nnevertheless hold that the main purpose exception takes Dynegy’s promise to Yates out\nof the Statute.\nThe main purpose doctrine, or leading object rule, takes a promise out of the Statute\nwhere ″the consideration given for the promise is primarily for the promisor’s own use\nand benefit.″10 The test focuses on the purpose of the promise, rather than on who\nreceives the benefit of the promise.11 This test was devised by the courts to determine\nwhether ″the promise was manifestly induced by other than [**18] gratuitous or\nsentimental purposes.″12\nThe circumstances surrounding the promise in this case began with an SEC investigation\ninto Project Alpha.

The SEC investigation resulted in a civil fine\nrelated to the company’s tax classification of the assets involved. However, the\nDepartment of Justice’s investigation was just beginning.\nAs media publicity and threats of indictment by the Department of Justice increased,\nDynegy’s board passed a resolution promising to advance attorney’s fees to officers and\nemployees of the company who were involved with Project Alpha. Dynegy’s bylaws\nrequired the company to indemnify its directors and officers for any civil or criminal\n [**19] proceedings arising out of their role as a Dynegy director or officer. Dynegy paid\nOlis’ first attorney directly and, when Olis desired to hire Yates, the company told Yates\nto send the bills to the company and that it would pay him directly. The urgency in\nsecuring the services of Yates, a more experienced trial attorney, was heightened by\nOlis’ recent indictment. Therefore, Dynegy had at least two self-serving reasons to\npromise to pay Yates to represent Olis: (1) to protect the company’s interests; and (2)\nto comply with its bylaws. Yates should therefore be able to enforce Dynegy’s oral\ncontract to [*646] pay him through trial because Dynegy was acting for its own\npurposes and not merely as a guarantor of its employee’s obligation.13\nIn conclusion, Dynegy has not asserted or argued that it intended to act as a guarantor\nof Olis’ debt. Moreover, the jury agreed that [**20] Dynegy’s promise to pay Yates\nthrough trial was not conditional, and thus its promise does not fall within the Statute\nof Frauds’ suretyship provision. However, even were I to agree that the suretyship\nprovision otherwise applies to this transaction, I would conclude that the main purpose\nexception takes Dynegy’s promise out of the Statute. Because the Court holds the\nStatute of Frauds applies to bar Dynegy’s oral contract with Yates, I respectfully dissent.\nJohn P.

LEXIS 436, **1\n\n\n\nOverview\nThe owners contended that the city approved revised plans that it knew were certain to\nhave the effect of flooding their land. The question was whether the court of appeals\napplied the correct standard in its legal sufficiency review by considering only the\nevidence and inferences that supported the finding. The court held that both the\ninclusive and exclusive standards for the scope of legal-sufficiency review, properly\napplied, must arrive at the same result, disregarding evidence contrary to the verdict\nunless reasonable jurors could not. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the\ncourt of appeals did not properly apply the scope of review in that the critical question\nwas the city’s state of mind because the owners had to prove the city knew that flooding\nwas substantially certain, and the court of appeals disregarded the evidence regarding\nwhy the city approved the plan. It was uncontroverted that three sets of engineers\ncertified that the revised plans met the city’s codes and regulations, and thus would not\nincrease downstream flooding.

First, an appellate court\nconducting a legal sufficiency review cannot disregard undisputed evidence that allows\nof only one logical inference. By definition, such evidence can be viewed in only one\nlight, and reasonable jurors can reach only one conclusion from it. Jurors are not free\nto reach a verdict contrary to such evidence; indeed, uncontroverted issues need not be\nsubmitted to a jury at all.\n\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Standards of Review > Substantial Evidence > General Overview\n\nHN9 Reviewing legal sufficiency in such cases encompasses a general no-evidence\nreview, because if some evidence supports the verdict then the contrary evidence was\nnot ″undisputed.″ But the review does not stop there; the evidence must also have only\none logical inference. Undisputed evidence that reasonable jurors could disbelieve has\ntwo: (1) it is true, or (2) it is not. Most often, undisputed contrary evidence becomes\nconclusive (and thus cannot be disregarded) when it concerns physical facts that cannot\nbe denied. Undisputed contrary evidence may also become conclusive when a party\nadmits it is true.\n\n  Evidence > Inferences & Presumptions > General Overview\n\nHN10 Undisputed evidence and conclusive evidence are not the same -- undisputed\nevidence may or may not be conclusive, and conclusive evidence may or may not be\nundisputed.\n\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Jury Trials > Jurors > General Overview\n  Civil Procedure > Trials > Jury Trials > Province of Court & Jury\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Standards of Review > Substantial Evidence > General Overview\n\nHN11 Proper legal-sufficiency review prevents reviewing courts from substituting their\nopinions on credibility for those of the jurors, but proper review also prevents jurors\nfrom substituting their opinions for undisputed truth.

Factual and Procedural History\nThe City of Keller is one of several fast-growing communities on the outskirts of [*808]\nFort Worth. 1 As part of that growth, the City approved plans for two new subdivisions,\nEstates of Oak Run and Rancho Serena, including plans for storm water drainage.\n\nThe Wilsons own property southeast of the new subdivisions, with a tract owned by Z.T.\nSebastian lying between. Before development, surface water flowed generally north to\nsouth from the land where the subdivisions were built, across the Sebastian and Wilson\nproperties, and into the Little Bear Creek Watershed.\nIn 1991, the [**3] City adopted a Master Drainage Plan providing for drainage\neasements across both the Sebastian and Wilson properties, and thence into Little Bear\nCreek. The City’s codes require developers to comply with the Master Plan, to provide\ndrainage for a 100-year rain event, and to avoid increasing the volume or velocity of\nwater discharged upon downhill properties.\n\nThe developers of Oak Run and Rancho Serena submitted plans to the City indicating\nthey would buy a drainage easement and build a ditch forty-five feet wide and more than\ntwo hundred yards long across the Sebastian property, and deed both to the City upon\ncompletion. 2 The plans also included detention basins on the subdivision properties, but\nomitted any drainage easement or ditch across the Wilsons’ property. The City’s director\nof public works approved the developers’ plans, and the City accepted the works on\ncompletion.\n    [**4] In accordance with the Master Plan, the City built a box culvert south of the\nWilsons’ property. But as the developers’ drainage ditch ended at the Wilsons’ north\nproperty line, there was no link between the two. The Wilsons alleged and the jury found\nthis omission increased flooding on the Wilsons’ property, ruining eight acres of\nfarmland the jury valued at almost $ 300,000.\n1\n   The City of Fort Worth asserts in an amicus brief that in 2001 alone it approved 325 subdivision plats creating 5,857 residential lots\nwithin its extraterritorial jurisdiction, which of course excludes surrounding communities.\n2\n   Evidence at trial and briefs by amici indicate that cities normally acquire title to these easements to ensure they are properly mowed\nand maintained after the developers’ departure.\n\n                                                  Jamie Graham Page 8 of 41\n\f                                        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *808; 2005 Tex.

It\npresented evidence that engineers for the developers, for the City, and for an outside\n [**5] firm the City retained all certified that the revised drainage plan complied with\nthe City’s codes and regulations -- including the ban against increasing downstream\nrunoff. Thus, the City asserts it had no reason to be substantially certain the opposite\nwould occur, until it did.\nA divided court of appeals rejected this contention. 4 In its legal sufficiency review, the\ncourt refused to consider the various engineers’ certifications because ″we are to\nconsider only the evidence and inferences that tend to support the finding and disregard\nall evidence and inferences to the contrary.″ 5 The City challenges [*809] this omission\nas applying the wrong scope of review.\nWe have on many occasions stated the scope of review precisely as the court of appeals\nsays (the ″exclusive″ standard). 6 [**7] But we have also stated that a reviewing court\nmust consider ″all of the evidence″ in the light favorable to the verdict (the ″inclusive″\nstandard).

Instead, the traditional scope of\nreview does not disregard contrary evidence if there is no favorable evidence [*811]\n(situation (a) above), or if contrary evidence renders supporting evidence incompetent\n(situation (b) above) or conclusively establishes the opposite (situation (d) above).\nAs the following examples show, this has remained the rule since. We do not presume\nto categorize all [**13] circumstances in which contrary evidence must be considered\nin a legal sufficiency review. HN3 Evidence can be disregarded whenever reasonable\njurors could do so, 18 an inquiry that is necessarily fact-specific. But it is important that\nwhen courts use the exclusive standard and disregard contrary evidence, they must\nrecognize certain exceptions to it.\n\nA.

LEXIS 436, **13\n\n\n\nIn Justice Calvert’s first situation -- a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact -- it\nis generally irrelevant whether a reviewing court considers contrary evidence. 19 If\nsupporting evidence is absent, opposing evidence cannot change that result. But in a\nnumber of cases, the lack of supporting evidence may not appear until all the evidence\nis reviewed in context.\n [**14] For example, publications alleged to be defamatory must be viewed as a whole\n-- including accompanying statements, headlines, pictures, and the general tenor and\nreputation of the source itself. 20 A court reviewing legal sufficiency cannot disregard\nparts of a publication, considering only false statements to support a plaintiff’s verdict\nor only true ones to support a defense verdict. 21\n\nSimilarly, reviewing courts must construe contracts as a whole; we do not consider only\nthe parts favoring one party [**15] and disregard the remainder, as that would render\nthe latter meaningless. 22 Even writings executed at different times must be considered\ntogether if they pertain to the same transaction. 23\n\nIt is not just writings that reviewing courts must consider in context. For example, in\nreviewing intentional infliction of emotional distress claims for legal sufficiency, ″we\nconsider the context and the relationship between the parties.″ 24 [**16] Acts that might\nconstitute outrageous conduct when dealing with a hearing-impaired consumer 25 may\nbe legally insufficient between [*812] business parties. 26 In our no-evidence reviews\nof successful claims, we have invariably reviewed not just evidence showing the\nconduct was outrageous, but also evidence showing that, in context, it was not. 27\n19\n    Calvert, supra note 12, at 364 (″If there is an absolute absence of evidence of a vital fact . . . an appellate court has no occasion\nto concern itself with an abstract rule such as how minds of reasonable men might view the situation.″).\n20\n    New Times, Inc. v.

LEXIS 436, **16\n\n\n\nMore generally, evidence cannot be taken out of context in a way that makes it seem to\nsupport a verdict when in fact it never did. 28 If a witness’s statement ″I did not do that″\nis contrary to the jury’s verdict, a reviewing court may need to disregard the whole\nstatement, but cannot rewrite [**17] it by disregarding the middle word alone.\nThus, HN4 if evidence may be legally sufficient in one context but insufficient in\nanother, the context cannot be disregarded even if that means rendering judgment\ncontrary to the jury’s verdict. Either ″evidence contrary to the verdict″ must be defined\nto exclude material contextual evidence, or it must be an exception to the general rule.\n\nB. Competency Evidence\nIt has long been the rule in Texas thatHN5 incompetent evidence is legally insufficient\nto support a judgment, even if admitted without objection. 29 Thus, evidence showing\nit to be incompetent cannot be disregarded, even if the result is contrary to the verdict.\nIf the rule were otherwise, incompetent evidence would always be legally sufficient,\nbecause the evidence showing it to be incompetent could never be [**18] considered.\n\nThus, for example, if an eyewitness’s location renders a clear view of an accident\n″physically impossible,″ it is no evidence of what occurred, even if the eyewitness\nthinks otherwise. 30 Similarly, an employee’s testimony that he was in the course and\nscope of his employment is legally insufficient to support a verdict against his employer\nif the evidence shows that legal conclusion to be incompetent. 31\n [**19] This exception frequently applies to expert testimony. When expert testimony\nis required, lay evidence supporting liability is legally insufficient. 32 In [*813] such\ncases, a no-evidence review cannot disregard contrary evidence showing the witness\nwas unqualified to give an opinion. 33 And if an expert’s opinion is based on certain\n\n28\n    Bostrom Seating, Inc. v.

First, an appellate court\nconducting a legal sufficiency review cannot ″disregard undisputed evidence that allows\nof only one logical inference.″ 50 [**26] By definition, such evidence can be viewed in\nonly one light, and reasonable jurors can reach only one conclusion from it. Jurors are\nnot free to reach a verdict contrary to such evidence; 51 indeed, uncontroverted issues\n [*815] need not be submitted to a jury at all. 52\n\nHN9 Reviewing legal sufficiency in such cases encompasses a general no-evidence\nreview, because if some evidence supports the verdict then the contrary evidence was\nnot ″undisputed.″ But the review does not stop there; [**27] the evidence must also\nhave only one logical inference. Undisputed evidence that reasonable jurors could\ndisbelieve has two: (1) it is true, or (2) it is not.\nMost often, undisputed contrary evidence becomes conclusive (and thus cannot be\ndisregarded) when it concerns physical facts that cannot be denied. Thus, no evidence\nsupports an impaired-access claim if it is undisputed that access remains along 90\npercent of a tract’s frontage. 53 Evidence that a buyer believed a product had been\nrepaired is conclusively negated by an accompanying letter to the contrary. 54 And an\ninsured’s liability has not been determined by an ″actual trial″ if the insured did not\nappear, present evidence, or challenge anything presented by his opponent. 55\n[**28] Undisputed contrary evidence may also become conclusive when a party admits\nit is true.

Compton, we found no evidence that\na railroad’s negligence caused an automobile to slam into the sixtieth car of a\nslow-moving train. 67 Again, the evidence was hotly disputed -- while railroad witnesses\ntestified that warning signs were in place at the crossing, the car’s driver and a passenger\ntestified they saw nothing, and would have been able to stop if they had. 68 Nevertheless,\nwe held there was no evidence to support the claim because, if the driver could not see\nthe side of a train before he hit it, he could not have seen a crossing sign either. 69\n\nOf course, there are few instances in which disputed evidence is conclusive, and many\ninstances in which [**32] undisputed evidence is not. As our sister court has noted,\ntestimony by a paid informant is legally sufficient to support a conviction, even if\n″twenty nuns testify that the defendant was with them at the time, far from the scene of\nthe crime … [and] twenty more nuns testify that they saw the informant commit the\ncrime.″ 70 But a more famous clerical hypothetical by Judge Learned Hand shows the\nopposite limit:\n\n      If, however, it were proved by twenty bishops that either party, when he used the\n      words [in a contract], intended something else than the usual meaning which the\n      law imposes upon them, he would still be held . . . . 71\n\nWhile jurors may generally believe either sinners or saints, their discretion is limited\nwhen it is proved beyond question that an ″eyewitness″ was actually far away in prison\nor totally blind on the day of the crime.\n     [**33]HN11 Proper legal-sufficiency review prevents reviewing courts from\nsubstituting [*817] their opinions on credibility for those of the jurors, but proper\nreview also prevents jurors from substituting their opinions for undisputed truth.

Virginia,\nappellate courts have recognized that, while ″one slender bit of evidence″ may be all a\nreviewing court needs to affirm a verdict based on the preponderance of the evidence,\na higher burden of proof requires a higher standard of review. 72 As we recently stated,\nthe standard for legal sufficiency works in tandem with the standard of review --\n″whenever the standard of proof at trial is elevated, the standard of appellate review\nmust likewise be elevated.″ 73 If the rule were otherwise, legally sufficient evidence to\nsupport a preponderance-of-the-evidence verdict would satisfy [**34] the higher\nburdens as well, thus rendering their differences meaningless. 74\nAccordingly, we have held that a legal sufficiency review must consider all the evidence\n(not just that favoring the verdict) in reviewing cases of parental termination, 75 [**35]\ndefamation, 76 and punitive damages. 77 In such cases, again, evidence contrary to a\nverdict cannot be disregarded.\n\nF. Consciousness Evidence\nFurther, we have had to particularize legal-sufficiency review in cases involving what\na party knew or why it took a certain course, as they are not amenable to review under\nthe exclusive standard.\n\nLong before gross negligence had to meet a clear-and-convincing burden, we recognized\nin Burk Royalty Co. v.

Liability in [*818] such cases requires proof that the insurer\ndenied coverage after it became reasonably clear. 81 But that standard will always be met\nif reviewing courts must disregard any evidence that coverage was unclear. 82\nSubsequent cases show that reviewing courts are in fact looking at all the evidence to\ndetermine whether coverage was reasonably clear. 83\n     [**37]This problem arises in other contexts as well. In discrimination cases,\ndischarged employees will never have to prove that the reason given for termination was\na pretext if no-evidence review must disregard that reason. 84 Government officials will\nnever be entitled to immunity if we consider only evidence suggesting they should have\nacted differently. 85 And limitations will never run under the discovery rule if reviewing\ncourts must disregard all evidence that claimants knew of their claims. 86\n [**38] This is not to say a reviewing court may credit a losing party’s explanations or\nexcuses if jurors could disregard them.

If the parties to an\noral contract testify to conflicting terms, a reviewing court must presume the terms were\nthose asserted by the winner. When all the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable\nto the jury verdict, some of it must be completely discounted. Though not disregarded\nat the outset, the end result is the same.\n\nThis has always been our practice in cases using the inclusive scope of review. Thus, we\nhave concluded that a bailee sold cotton without the bailor’s consent, despite the\nformer’s denials, because the jury verdict favored the latter. 93 [**42] And we have\naffirmed a gross negligence verdict based on testimony that the defendant’s speed was\n80 miles per hour, without mentioning his own testimony to a speed half that. 94\nNor is it necessary to have testimony from both parties before jurors [*820] may\ndisbelieve either. HN14 Jurors may disregard even uncontradicted and unimpeached\ntestimony from disinterested witnesses. 95 Thus, an architect’s uncontradicted testimony\nthat he relied on a 20-year warranty was not binding on jurors when the bid\nspecifications he prepared included only much shorter warranties. [**43] 96 Nor was an\ninsured’s uncontradicted testimony about lost furnishings binding on jurors when the\nfire scene contained several indications of arson but few of burnt furniture. 97 Even\nuncontroverted expert testimony does not bind jurors unless the subject matter is one for\nexperts alone. 98\n\n\n92\n     Runnels, 47 S.W. at 972.\n93\n     Cochran v.

For example, in such cases we have sometimes detailed only the evidence that\nsupported a jury’s fraud finding. 103 We have affirmed a bad-faith verdict for legal\nsufficiency despite ″significant evidence″ that the insurer acted in [*821] good faith.\n104\n    We have found some evidence of lost profits, even though income tax returns\nshowed the contrary.

But in each case we either discounted or never mentioned conflicting evidence\ncontrary to the verdict because viewing the evidence in the light favorable to the verdict\nrequired us to do so.\n99\n      Bentley v.

Thus, in product liability cases jurors may find evidence of a defect\nfrom subsequent modifications, even if there were plenty of other reasons for the\nchanges. 109 Even if a defendant admits approaching an intersection from the wrong way\non a one-way street, jurors may infer the plaintiff failed to keep a proper lookout,\n [**48] as that is one possible inference from the accident itself. 110 Similarly, jurors\nmay infer that relatives tore down posters of a missing child to assist the child’s father,\neven though another inference was that the signs simply embarrassed them. 111\n\nAccordingly, courts reviewing all the evidence in a light favorable to the verdict must\nassume jurors made all inferences in favor of their verdict if reasonable minds could,\nand disregard all other inferences in their legal sufficiency review.\n\nIV. Reconciling the Standards\n\nHaving noted the dual lines of authority stating the scope of no-evidence review, and the\nproper application and exceptions to each, [**49] we turn to the question of which one\nis correct. For the reasons [*822] discussed below, we believe the answer is both.\n\nA. Goals: The Standards Must Be The Same\n107\n      St. Joseph Hosp. v.

LEXIS 436, **49\n\n\n\nHN19 Whether a court begins by reviewing all the evidence or disregarding part in a\nlegal-sufficiency review, there can be no disagreement about where that review should\nend. If the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in\ntheir conclusions, then jurors must be allowed to do so. 112 [**50] A reviewing court\ncannot substitute its judgment for that of the trier-of-fact, so long as the evidence falls\nwithin this zone of reasonable disagreement. 113\n\nSimilarly, there is no disagreement about how a reviewing court should view evidence\nin the process of that review. HN20 Whether a reviewing court starts with all or only\npart of the record, the court must consider evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it. 114 [**51] But if\nthe evidence allows of only one inference, neither jurors nor the reviewing court may\ndisregard it. 115\n\nGiven these premises, it is no coincidence that the two standards should reach the same\nresult -- indeed they must. Any scope of appellate review smaller than what reasonable\njurors could believe will reverse some verdicts that are perfectly reasonable; any scope\nof review larger than what reasonable jurors could believe will affirm some verdicts that\nare not.\nFurther, HN21 the two must coincide if this Court is to perform its constitutional duties.\nAlthough factual sufficiency has been the sole domain of the intermediate appellate\ncourts in Texas since 1891, our jurisdiction has always included legal sufficiency, as\n\n112\n      See Tarrant Reg’l Water Dist. v.

LEXIS 436, **57\n\n\n\n [**57] The one exception in which both standards do not expressly appear is in the\nscope of review for summary judgments. Here, there is only one standard -- a reviewing\ncourt must examine the entire record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,\nindulging every reasonable inference and resolving any doubts against the motion. 124\nReviewing courts do not disregard the evidence supporting the motion; [*825] if they\ndid, all summary judgments would be reversed.\n\nIn practice, however, a different scope of review applies when a summary judgment\nmotion is filed without [**58] supporting evidence. 125 In such cases, evidence\nsupporting the motion is effectively disregarded because there is none; under the rule,\nit is not allowed. Thus, although a reviewing court must consider all the summary\njudgment evidence on file, in some cases that review will effectively be restricted to the\nevidence contrary to the motion.\n\nThe standards for taking any case from the jury should be the same, no matter what\nmotion is used. If only one standard were proper, we would not expect both to appear\nin cases reviewing directed verdicts, judgments notwithstanding the verdict, and\nsummary judgments. But both do.\n\nC. Federal Courts: The Standards Are The Same\n\nThe federal courts have had a similar split of authority between the inclusive and\nexclusive standards for scope of review. But no longer -- the United States Supreme\nCourt recently concluded in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. that the two\ntests are the same. 126 [**59]\nUnder Rule 50 of the federal rules of procedure, a court should render judgment as a\nmatter of law when ″there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury\nto find for that party on that issue.″ 127 In deciding whether all or only part of the\nevidence should be considered, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n      The Courts of Appeals have articulated differing formulations as to what evidence\n      a court is to consider in ruling on a Rule 50 motion.

Those\n      decisions holding that review under Rule 50 should be limited to evidence\n      favorable to the nonmovant appear to have their genesis in Wilkerson v. McCarthy\n      128\n         . In Wilkerson, we stated that ″in passing upon [**60] whether there is\n      sufficient evidence to submit an issue to the jury we need look only to the\n      evidence and reasonable inferences which tend to support the case of″ the\n      nonmoving party. 129 But subsequent decisions have clarified that this passage\n      was referring to the evidence to which the trial court should give credence, not the\n      evidence that the court should review. In the analogous context of summary\n      judgment under Rule 56, we have stated that the court must review the record\n      ″taken as a whole.″ And the standard for granting summary judgment ″mirrors″\n      the standard for judgment as a matter of law, such that ″the inquiry under each is\n      the same.″ It therefore follows that, in entertaining a motion for judgment as a\n       [*826] matter of law, the court should review all of the evidence in the record.\n      130\n\n\n [**61] We address the Supreme Court’s conclusion as to the most appropriate standard\nbelow; the relevant point here is its conclusion that differences between the inclusive\nand exclusive standards are more semantic than real.\n\nD. Objections: The Standards Are Not The Same\n\nWhile we have used the two standards for the scope of review interchangeably for many\nyears in many different contexts, several arguments suggest they are not the same.\n\nFirst, the courts of appeals often use the two standards in illustrations of the difference\nbetween legal and factual sufficiency, with the exclusive standard tied to the former and\nthe inclusive standard to the latter:\n\n      When [reviewing] legal sufficiency, we consider only the evidence and inferences\n      that tend to support the award of damages and disregard all evidence and\n      inferences to the contrary. . . . When we review factual sufficiency, we consider\n      and weigh all of the evidence and will set aside the verdict only if it is so against\n128\n      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104622\"><a href=\"/opinion/104622/wilkerson-v-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

As demonstrated\nin Parts II and III above, it is generally true that the result of legal-sufficiency review\nis to disregard contrary evidence, but there are exceptions when a reviewing court\ncannot. It is not surprising that in drawing the general distinction between legal and\nfactual sufficiency, courts have not complicated that distinction by listing the several\nexceptions in which the scope of review -- though not the standard of review -- may\noverlap.\nSecond, it has been argued that the exclusive standard ″is an important prophylactic″\nagainst invasion of the jury’s province, as appellate judges are less likely to consider\ncontrary evidence when they should not if the exclusive standard is used. 133 But if that\n [**63] is true, the opposite should also be the case -- appellate courts are less likely\nto consider contrary evidence when they must (as shown in Part II) if the exclusive\nstandard is used. No matter which standard is used, appellate courts must take care not\nto consider or disregard too little or too much.\n[*827] Conversely, several factors appear to favor application of the inclusive standard.\nFirst, when we have said ″we must look only at that evidence which tends to support the\njudgment,″ 134 we could not have been speaking literally; no glasses filter evidence, and\njudges cannot abandon such judgments to law clerks or litigants. It is often hard to say\nwhether evidence does or does not support a verdict -- the same facts may support\ndifferent conclusions, 135 or may support one part of a verdict but not another. 136 Nor\ncan evidence [**64] supporting a verdict be identified by which party offered it --\n131\n      Carter v.

LEXIS 436, **64\n\n\n\nparties depend on admissions and cross-examination during their opponent’s case, and\nminimize damaging evidence by presenting it during their own. As a practical matter, a\ncourt cannot begin to say what evidence supports a verdict without reviewing it all.\n[**65] Second, an appellate court that begins by disregarding one party’s evidence may\nstrike many citizens as extending something less than justice for all. Concerns about\nopen government and open courts suggest an appellate process that considers all the\nevidence, though deferring to the jury’s verdict. While there is some dispute whether\nLady Justice should wear a blindfold, 137 the metaphor was surely never intended to\nsuggest that justice disregards the facts.\nIn sum, the exclusive standard is helpful in recognizing the distinctive roles of judge and\njury, intermediate and supreme court. By contrast, the inclusive standard is helpful in\nrecognizing what courts actually do, and must be seen to do. Both are important; we\nshould avoid choosing between them if we can.\n\nE. Conclusion: The Standards Are The Same\nAs both [**66] the inclusive and exclusive standards for the scope of legal-sufficiency\nreview have a long history in Texas, as both have been used in other contexts to review\nmatter-of-law motions, as the federal courts have decided the differences between the\ntwo are more semantic than real, and as both -- properly applied -- must arrive at the\nsame result, we see no compelling reason to choose among them.\nThe key qualifier, of course, is ″properly applied.″ HN22 The final test for legal\nsufficiency must always be whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and\nfair-minded people to reach the verdict under review. Whether a reviewing court begins\nby considering all the evidence or only the evidence supporting the verdict,\nlegal-sufficiency review in the proper light must credit favorable evidence if reasonable\njurors could, and disregard contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.\nWhile judges and lawyers often disagree about legal sufficiency in particular cases,\n [*828] the disagreements are almost always about what evidence jurors can or must\ncredit and what inferences they can or must make. It is inevitable in human affairs that\nreasonable people sometimes disagree; thus, it is also [**67] inevitable that they will\nsometimes disagree about what reasonable people can disagree about. This is not a new\nproblem; Justice Calvert noted it almost fifty years ago:\n      The rule as generally stated is that if reasonable minds cannot differ from the\n      conclusion that the evidence lacks probative force it will be held to be the legal\n137\n     See Judith Resnik, Managerial Judges, 96 HARV. L.R. 374, 382-83 (1982) (noting that images of justice appeared blindfolded only\nwithin the last four hundred years).\n\n                                                Jamie Graham Page 31 of 41\n\f                                        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *828; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **67\n\n\n\n      equivalent of no evidence. The application of the rule can lead to strange results.\n      It is theoretically possible, and sometimes not far from actual fact, that five\n      members of the Supreme Court will conclude that the evidence supporting a\n      finding of a vital fact has no probative force, and in reaching the conclusion\n      through application of the rule will thus hold, in effect, that the trial judge who\n      overruled a motion for instructed verdict, the twelve jurors who found the\n      existence of the vital fact, the three justices of the Court of Civil Appeals who\n      overruled a ″no evidence″ point of error and four dissenting justices of the\n      Supreme Court are not men 138 [**68] of ″reasonable minds.″ 139\nIt is not hubris that occasionally requires an appellate court to find a jury verdict has no\nreasonable evidentiary basis. As Justice Frankfurter stated long ago:\n      Only an incompetent or a wilful judge would take a case from the jury when the\n      issue should be left to the jury. But since questions of negligence are questions of\n      degree, often very nice differences of degree, judges of competence and\n      conscience have in the past, and will in the future, disagree whether proof in a\n      case is sufficient to demand submission to the jury. The fact that [one] thinks there\n      was enough to leave the case to the jury does not indicate that the other [is]\n      unmindful of the jury’s function. The easy but timid way out for a trial judge is\n      to leave all cases tried to a jury for jury determination, but in so doing he fails in\n      his duty to take a case from the jury when the evidence would not warrant a\n      verdict by it. A timid judge, like a biased judge, is intrinsically a lawless judge.\n      140\n\n\n\n [**69] V. Application to the Facts\nIt remains to apply the scope of review to the facts presented.\nA majority of the court of appeals affirmed the verdict for the Wilsons, finding legally\nsufficient evidence that the City knew increased flooding on the Wilsons’ property was\nsubstantially certain to occur. 141 The majority pointed to the following proof. First, the\n\n\n138\n      Justice Calvert’s use of the masculine in 1960 may perhaps be forgiven, for although Hattie Hennenberg, Hortense Ward, and Ruth\nBrazzil served temporarily on this Court in 1925, and Sarah T. Hughes was appointed as a state district judge ten years later, it was not\nuntil 1954 that the Texas Constitution was amended to allow women to serve as jurors, and not until 1973 that Mary Lou Robinson\nbecame the first women to serve as a state appellate judge.

The critical question in this case was the City’s state of mind\n-- the Wilsons had to prove the City knew (not should have known) that flooding was\nsubstantially certain. A reviewing court cannot evaluate what the City knew by\ndisregarding most of what it was told.\nMoreover,HN23 when a case involves scientific or technical issues requiring expert\nadvice (as this one does), jurors cannot disregard a party’s reliance on experts hired for\nthat very purpose without some evidence supplying a reasonable basis for doing so. 145\nHere, it was uncontroverted that three sets of engineers certified that the revised plans\nmet the City’s codes and regulations -- and thus would not increase downstream\nflooding. The same firm that drew up the original Master Plan certified the revised one;\nunless the City had some reason to know the first certification was true [**71] and the\nsecond one was false (of which there was no evidence), there was only one logical\ninference jurors could draw.\nNone of the evidence cited by the court of appeals showed the City knew more than it\nwas told by the engineers. The Wilsons’ expert testified that flooding was (in his\nopinion) inevitable, but not that the City knew it was inevitable. The Wilsons’ expert\ngave no opinion on the latter point.\nSecond, ending a ditch at a neighbor’s property line may be evidence that a defendant\nwas substantially [**72] certain of the result in some cases, but not in the context of this\n142\n      86 S.W.3d at 703, 705.\n143\n      86 S.W.3d at 705.\n144\n      86 S.W.3d at 704-05.\n145\n     Provident Am.

Calculating the effect of detention\nponds and absorption in a grassy drainage ditch forty-five feet wide and over two\nhundred yards long required hydrological formulas, computer models, and mathematical\ncalculations. The omission of the ditch across the Wilsons’ property obviously raised\nconcerns that the City investigated, but was no evidence that the City knew the advice\nit received in response was wrong.\n\nThe Wilsons also point to a letter Sebastian’s attorney wrote the City demanding\nindemnity in case the new ditch flooded the Wilsons. But attorneys must protect a client\nfrom potential liability whether it is real [*830] or imagined -- and justly so. In the\nletter, the attorney never purports to be an expert in hydrology, or cite the opinions of\nanyone who was. This letter may have required the City to investigate, but again is no\nevidence it knew the advice it received was wrong. 146\n  [**73]   Our concurring colleagues believe reasonable jurors could nevertheless\ndisregard what all the engineers certified because the City had a financial incentive to\nbelieve them rather than pay the Wilsons. Of course, defendants have a financial\nincentive to avoid paying damages in every case; if that incentive alone is some\nevidence of liability, then plaintiffs create enough evidence to go to the jury every time\nthey file suit.\nBut more important, this ignores what the Wilsons had to prove -- not that the City might\nhave disbelieved the engineers’ reports, but that it did. This requires evidence of\n″objective indicia of intent″ showing the City knew identifiable harm was occurring or\nsubstantially certain to result. 147 Jurors’ doubts about the engineers’ reports or the\nCity’s motives could not supply them with objective indicia that the City knew flooding\nwould occur. Constitutional concerns about the roles of judge and jury do not allow\neither to make such evidence up.\n [**74] We agree with the court of appeals that the Wilsons presented some evidence\nthat the City damaged their property, and that in drawing up and approving drainage\nplans it was acting for a public purpose. The missing piece in the evidence here is proof\nthat the City knew the plans it approved were substantially certain to increase flooding\non the Wilsons’ properties. While the City certainly knew that fact after the flooding\nstarted, the Wilsons never pleaded or submitted to the jury any takings theory other than\nthe City’s initial approval.\n146\n     Cf.

I agree with this\nstandard and join Parts I through IV of the Court’s opinion. But I cannot join Part V,\nbecause the Court misapplies the standard that it so carefully [*831] articulates by\ncrediting evidence the jury could reasonably disregard.\nThe City of Keller’s Master Drainage Plan required it in part to condemn a 2.8-acre\ndrainage easement on the Wilson property for construction of an earthen channel\nforty-five feet wide and five feet deep that would funnel water from the adjoining\nSebastian property over the Wilson property into the Little Bear Creek Watershed. The\nCity chose not to proceed with this portion of the plan, though, claiming reliance on\nengineers’ assurances that the developers’ installation of retention ponds on neighboring\nland could prevent flooding. The drainage channel that was actually built ended at the\nedge of the Sebastian [**76] property and funneled water directly onto the Wilsons’\nland, destroying eight acres of farmland worth almost $ 300,000. The Court holds that\nthe jury was required to believe the City’s testimony that it relied on the engineers’\nassurances and thus did not know flooding was substantially certain to occur, stating that\nwhen a case requires expert testimony ″jurors cannot disregard a party’s reliance on\nexperts hired for that very purpose without some evidence supplying a reasonable basis\nfor doing so.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___.

Accordingly, I concur in the Court’s judgment\nbut not its reasoning.\nI\nQuestions of intent are generally proved only by circumstantial evidence; as the court\nof appeals in this case aptly noted, ″defendants will rarely admit knowing to a\nsubstantial certainty that given results would follow from their actions,″ and therefore\nthe jury must be ″free to discredit defendants’ protestations that no harm was intended\nand to draw inferences necessary to establish intent.″ </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351865/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704. I agree with\nthe Court that the jury’s ability to disbelieve the City’s protestations is not itself\n″evidence of liability.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___. Instead, the jury’s ability to weigh the\nwitnesses’ credibility means that the City’s testimony did not conclusively establish its\nlack of liability. Because liability is not conclusively negated, we must examine the\nrecord to see if there is legally sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that\nthe City knew flooding was substantially certain to occur. I would hold that the evidence\nof intent that was presented in this case allowed the jury to draw such an inference.\nAt trial, the Wilsons presented evidence [**78] that the City had independent sources\nof knowledge that flooding was substantially certain to occur. First, they demonstrated\nthat the developers’ plan itself was flawed. Rather than incorporate a drainage ditch\nrunning across the Wilson property, as the City’s Master Plan required, the developers’\nplan ended the drainage ditch abruptly at the edge of the Wilson property. The Wilsons’\nexpert testified that the plan’s implementation would necessarily ″increase the volume\nand flow of water across the Wilson property from the rate of fifty-five cubic feet per\nsecond to ninety-three cubic feet per second.″ 86 S.W.3d at [*832] 703. Second, the\nCity was aware that water flowed across the Wilson property before the development\ncommenced, and, as the court of appeals pointed out, the City’s Director of Public\nWorks admitted that the City knew the development would increase the water’s flow\nand velocity; specifically, he testified that ″the City knew the upstream water would be\nabsorbed less and would flow faster due to the removal of trees and vegetation from the\ndevelopments and from the forty-five-foot-wide earthen channel″ that ended at the\nWilson property’s edge. Id. at 705. [**79] Finally, there was evidence that the City\nreceived a letter warning that the developers’ plan would subject the Wilson property to\nflooding.\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 36 of 41\n\f                          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *832; 2005 Tex.

City officials testified that\nthey relied on the representations of engineers who assured them retention ponds could\nsubstitute for a drainage easement and the Wilson property would not be damaged. If the\njury accepted this evidence as true, I agree that the intent element would be negated,\nwhich would preclude the City’s takings liability. But I do not agree that the jury was\nbound to accept the City’s testimony as true. The Court itself notes that jurors ″may\nchoose to believe one witness and disbelieve another,″ and that ″courts reviewing all the\nevidence in a light favorable to the verdict thus assume that jurors credited testimony\nfavorable to the verdict and disbelieved testimony contrary to it.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___.\nThis statement mirrors our prior jurisprudence, which has long provided that a jury ″has\nseveral alternatives available when presented with conflicting evidence″ because it\n″may believe [**80] one witness and disbelieve others,″ ″may resolve inconsistencies\nin the testimony of any witness,″ and ″may accept lay testimony over that of experts.″\nMcGalliard v.

The\nCity’s testimony does not meet this standard. The City Manager did testify that the City\n″would not have approved the developments unless [it was] assured that the developments\ndid not increase the velocity of water or the flow of water″ onto the neighboring\nproperty. 86 S.W.3d at 706. But the Wilsons disputed whether the City’s protestations\nwere credible, pointing out that the City had a powerful incentive to profess a lack of\nknowledge through reliance on the engineers’ assurances because it would then avoid\nthe considerable expense of compensating the Wilsons for the property that would\notherwise have been condemned under the Master Drainage Plan. See id. at 705. [**81]\nMoreover, the Court’s conclusion that juries cannot disregard a party’s reliance on\nexpert opinions is not consistent with our jurisprudence. The Court cites two cases for\nthis proposition, but neither supports the Court’s analysis; instead, both cases support\nthe conclusion that the jury, as the finder of fact, should appropriately resolve factual\ndisputes regarding a party’s reliance on hired experts.

We did state that reliance on an expert’s\nopinion will not preclude a finding of bad faith if the expert’s opinion was ″unreliable\nand the insurer knew or should have known that to be the case. [**82] ″ Id. However,\nwe did not hold that the jury must credit a party’s testimony that it relied on an expert.\nWe reiterated this point in Nicolau, another bad-faith insurance case. There, the Court\nnoted ″we have never held that the mere fact that an insurer relies upon an expert’s\nreport to deny a claim automatically forecloses bad faith recovery as a matter of law,″\nand again concluded that purported ″reliance upon an expert’s report, standing alone,\nwill not necessarily shield″ the defendant from liability. Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d at 448. The\nCourt conceded that ″were we the trier of fact in this case, we may well have concluded\nthat [the insurer] did not act in bad faith,″ but concluded that the ″determination is not\nours to make″ because ″the Constitution allocates that task to the jury and prohibits us\nfrom reweighing the evidence.″ Id. at 450 (citing TEX. CONST. art. I, § 15, art. V, §§\n6, 10).\nThe same is true in this case. The jury was not required to believe that the City did not\nknow flooding was substantially certain to occur because it relied on assurances to the\ncontrary; as a reviewing Court, we should ″assume that jurors credited [**83] testimony\nfavorable to the verdict and disbelieved testimony contrary to it.″ ___ S.W.3d at ___.\nSuch credibility determinations are uniquely suited and constitutionally committed to\nthe fact finder.

V, § 6; see also Nicolau, 951 S.W.2d\nat 450.\n\nII\nAlthough I disagree with the Court’s conclusion that the jury was required to credit the\nCity’s testimony, I agree with its judgment in the City’s favor because, in my view, the\nCity’s mere approval of the private development plans did not result in a taking for\npublic use, as the constitutional standard requires for a compensable taking. TEX.\nCONST. art. I, § 17. The City did not appropriate or even regulate the use of the\nWilsons’ land, nor did it design the drainage plan for the proposed subdivisions. Instead,\nthe City merely approved subdivision plans designed by private developers, and that\ndesign included inadequate drainage capabilities. The City argues, and I agree, that its\nmere approval of private plans did not transfer responsibility for the content of those\nplans from the developers to the City.

We have held that, to be liable for a taking, a governmental entity must\n″perform certain acts in the exercise of its lawful authority . . . which resulted in the\ntaking or damaging of plaintiffs’ property, and which acts were the proximate cause of\nthe taking or damaging of such property.″ State v.

In this case, flooding resulted from the developers’\ndefective drainage design, not from the City’s approval of the plat; thus, the City’s\napproval was not the proximate cause of the damage to the Wilson property.\nOther courts, faced with similar facts, have also concluded that a governmental entity\ncannot be liable for a taking when its only action is to approve a private development\nplan.

In Phillips, the Washington Supreme Court observed that there is no public\naspect to a private development and concluded that ″if the county or city were [**86]\nliable for the negligence of a private developer, based on approval under existing\nregulations, then the municipalities, and ultimately the taxpayers, would become the\nguarantors or insurers for the actions of private developers whose development damages\nneighboring properties.″ Phillips, 968 P.2d at 878. The court in Pepper similarly\nexamined an inverse condemnation claim based upon a county’s approval of private\ndevelopments with defective drainage plans; it, too, concluded that the county’s\napproval did not cause the resultant flooding and did not result in an unconstitutional\ntaking. Pepper, 871 P.2d at 606. The court noted that the flooding was ″not the result\nof the County appropriating or regulating their use of the land,″ and held that ″the fact\nthat a county regulates development and requires compliance with road and drainage\nrestrictions does not transform a private development into a public project.″ Id. The\ncourt concluded that because ″land use regulation of [the plaintiffs’] property did not\ncause the damages, no inverse condemnation was involved.″ Id. I am persuaded by the\nreasoning of the courts in Phillips and [**87] Pepper, and would similarly conclude\nthat the City’s plat approval in this case did not amount to an unconstitutional taking as\na matter of law.\n                                  Jamie Graham Page 39 of 41\n\f                          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *834; 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, **87\n\n\n\nThe court of appeals in this case advanced an alternative reason for affirming the trial\ncourt’s judgment, suggesting that even if the City could not be liable for merely\napproving a subdivision plat, it could nevertheless be held liable for failing to condemn\na drainage easement across the Wilson property. 86 S.W.3d at 707. The court of appeals\nstated that ″the City chose not to condemn any of the Wilson property,″ but instead\n″allowed the water flowing from the Sebastian easement to discharge, uncontrolled,\nacross the Wilson property.″ Id. As noted above, however, it was the developers’\nplan--not the City’s actions--that allowed the water to flood the Wilson property.\nBecause the City’s action did not cause the flooding, I disagree that the City’s failure\nto condemn an easement is relevant to takings liability. If the City were responsible for\nthe flooding but chose not to condemn the property, it might be subject to\ninverse-condemnation liability. See Tarrant County Reg’l Water Dist. v.

However, if a governmental entity’s actions are not the [*835]\n″proximate cause of the taking or damaging″ of the property, then the entity cannot be\nliable for a taking. Hale, 146 S.W.2d at 736. Accordingly, the entity need not condemn\nproperty merely because a private entity is causing damage. This rule does not leave\nowners of flooded property without a remedy; when a private development floods\nneighboring land, the owner of the damaged property will ordinarily have recourse\nagainst the private parties causing the damage. See TEX. WATER CODE § 11.086(a), (b)\n(providing that ″no person may divert or impound the natural flow of surface waters in\nthis state . . . in a manner that damages the property of another by the overflow of the\nwater diverted or impounded″ and that ″[a] person whose property is injured by an\noverflow of water caused by an unlawful diversion or impounding has remedies at law\nand in equity and may recover damages occasioned by the overflow″). Because the\ndevelopers’ design of the plat--not [**89] the City’s approval--caused the flooding\ndamage in this case, I would hold that the City cannot be held liable for an\nunconstitutional taking under Article I, Section 17 of the Texas Constitution.\n\nIII\n\nBecause I believe the Court fails to give due regard to the jury’s right to make credibility\ndeterminations, I cannot join Part V of the Court’s opinion. But because I conclude that\nthe City’s mere act of approving a private development plan did not cause the Wilson\nproperty to be ″taken, damaged or destroyed for or applied to public use,″ TEX.

The second owner drove the\ntruck approximately 47,000 more miles [**2] and had the truck repaired four times at\nthe Red McCombs Ford dealership in San Antonio (″Red McCombs″).

Torrington Co., 46 S.W.3d at 844.\nIn an attempt to defeat Ford’s motion, the Ridgways presented affidavits from all three\nof the truck’s owners and from Bill Greenlees, an expert who inspected the truck after\nthe accident. The owners explained when and where they purchased the truck, how\nmany miles they drove it, and any modifications or repairs they made. In addition,\nRidgway described when he first noticed the fire, how he reacted, and the injuries he\nsustained. Greenlees explained that his expert opinion was based on his visual\ninspection of the truck after the accident, a visual comparison of a similar but\nundamaged truck, a review of Ford service manuals, and a review of the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration’s database. Based on the areas of greatest\ndamage to the truck [**5] and an indication of a ″hot spot in the left center area of the\nengine compartment,″ Greenlees concluded that the fire originated within the engine\ncompartment and opined that ″a malfunction of the electrical system in the engine\ncompartment is suspected of having caused this accident.″ Greenlees, however, declined\nto eliminate all portions of the fuel system as a possible cause of the accident and\nconceded that ″the actual cause of the fire has not been determine [sic] yet.″ Although\nGreenlees suggested that further investigation might yield a more definitive conclusion,\nparticularly [*601] if the vehicle were disassembled, the Ridgways made no motion for\nfurther testing and did not complain that the trial court failed to allow adequate time for\nor sufficient scope of discovery. 1\nHN3 When determining if more than a scintilla of evidence has been produced in\nresponse to [**6] a Rule 166a(i) motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be\nviewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.

Ridgway’s affidavit establishes only that a fire\noccurred, and Greenlees could say no more than that he ″suspects″ the electrical system\ncaused the fire. Because Greenlees could not rule out part of the fuel system as a\npossible cause and because there is no proof that identified a defect in the truck at the\ntime it left the manufacturer, Greenlees’ affidavit is not sufficient to raise a fact issue.\nThe Ridgways argue that this proof is nevertheless sufficient under section 3 of the Third\nRestatement of Torts, which provides:\n\n   It may be inferred that the harm sustained by the plaintiff was caused by a product\n   defect existing at the time of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific\n   defect, when the [**8] incident that harmed the plaintiff:\n   (a) was of the kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of a product defect; and\n   (b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other than the\n   product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution.\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 3 (1998). No Texas\ncourt has ever cited this section, and we do not decide today whether it reflects the law\nof this state. Even if section 3 were the law in Texas, it would generally apply only to\nnew or almost new products. Such products typically have not been modified or\nrepaired, therefore making a product defect the likely cause of an accident. The [*602]\ndrafters of the Restatement realized this limitation and noted: ″The inference of defect\nmay not be drawn . . . from the mere fact of a product-related accident. . . . Evidence\nthat the product may have been used improperly or was altered by repair people\nweakens the inference [that there was a product defect].″ Id. at reporters’ notes to cmt.\nd (citations omitted).

LEXIS 74, **10\n\n\n\nrule of section 3 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability does not\naccurately restate Texas law.\n    [**11] Section 3 states:\n\n      Circumstantial Evidence Supporting Inference of Product Defect\n      It may be inferred that the harm sustained by the plaintiff was caused by a product\n      defect existing at the time of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific\n      defect, when the incident that harmed the plaintiff:\n      (a) was of a kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of product defect; and\n      (b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other than [*603]\n      product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution. 2\n\n″It may be inferred″ cannot mean ″it is always proper to infer″, as the present case\ndemonstrates. Section 3(a) requires only that an injury-causing incident be the kind of\nthing that ordinarily results from a product defect, not that the incident is the kind of\nthing that ordinarily does not result unless there is a defect. A pickup suddenly bursting\ninto flame for no discernible reason is the kind of thing that ordinarily occurs as a result\nof product defect in the sense that product defects do cause such things. Thus Ridgway\nhas satisfied section 3(a), even though it is also true that fires in vehicles ordinarily\noccur for many reasons other than [**12] product defect. 3 As for section 3(b), although\nRidgway cannot conclusively negate that the fire was caused solely by something other\nthan a defect, Ford cannot point to anything as the sole cause of the fire. Therefore,\nRidgway argues, section 3 entitles him to an inference that his pickup was defective and\nthe further inference that the defect existed when Ford sold the pickup. The Court rejects\nRidgway’s argument, not because of the text of the rule, but because comment d to\nsection 3, the reporter’s notes, and cases allowing proof of products liability by\ncircumstantial evidence limit the stated rule. In other words, the section 3 rule means\nmuch less than it appears to say.\n    [**13] ″It may be inferred″ really means ″it is sometimes proper to infer″, but while\nthis reading makes the rule stated in section 3 accurate, it also makes the rule not very\nhelpful. Few would question the use of circumstantial evidence to prove products\nliability in appropriate cases. The hard issue is not whether it can be done, but when and\nhow. The comments to section 3 and the cases cited in support of it illustrate the kinds\n2\n     RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY § 3 (1998).\n3\n    See U.S. FIRE ADMINISTRATION, HIGHWAY VEHICLE FIRES, 2 TOPICAL FIRE RESEARCH SERIES No. 4 (July 2001,\nrevised Mar. 2002) (reporting that highway vehicle fires are due 66% to mechanical or design problems 18% to incendiary or suspicious\norigins, 8% to misuse, 4% to operational deficiency, and 3% to other design, construction, and installation deficiencies), available at\nhttp://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v2i4.pdf (last visited Feb. 5, 2004).\n\n                                                 Jamie Graham Page 8 of 10\n\f                                        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894501\"><a href=\"/opinion/894501/ford-motor-co-v-ridgway/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *603; 2004 Tex.

Sections 3(a) and (b) are\nless strict than the parallel provisions in sections 328D(1)(a) and (b), at least in a case\nlike the present one. It cannot be said that fires in pickups do not ordinarily occur absent\na product defect; they ordinarily occur for all sorts of reasons. 6 Nor has Ridgway\n″eliminated by evidence″ the existence of other responsible causes of the fire. The most\nhe can say is that Ford has offered no evidence of another cause. He has not shown that,\ngiven the circumstances, another cause was impossible or even improbable. If section\n3 were as strictly worded as section 328D, Ridgway’s claim would clearly fail.\nTexas law of res ipsa loquitur is at least as strict as section 328D.

Summary judgment in\nappellee’s favor was entered on the grounds that the oral contract was unenforceable\nunder Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code Ann. § 26.01(b)(6), because it could not be performed\nwithin one year from the date of the agreement. Appellant sought the court’s review. The\ncourt held that § 26.01(b)(6) referred to agreements which could not be performed\nwithin one year of their making. But if the occurrence of some other contingent event\nwould terminate the agreement before it had been fully performed, then the possibility\n                                       Jamie Graham\n\f                        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1723627\"><a href=\"/opinion/1723627/young-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *506; 1996 Tex.

Here, the contract required appellant to\nwork for a month and a half before becoming entitled to payments. That time period\nthen necessarily expired within one year of the agreement’s making. Further, the length\nof time the payments were to occur could also have been fully performed within one\nyear. Accordingly, § 26.01(b)(6) was not applicable. Judgment reversed and remanded.\n\nOutcome\n\nSummary judgment in appellee’s favor reversed and remanded where the oral contract\nbetween appellant and appellee was not required to be in writing to be enforceable\nwhere performance of the contract was contingent upon an event which necessarily had\nto occur within a year of the contract’s making, and where the time for performance\ncould have been fully performed within one year.\n\nLexisNexis® Headnotes\n\n  Civil Procedure > Appeals > Summary Judgment Review > General Overview\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Summary Judgment > Entitlement as Matter of Law > General\n  Overview\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Summary Judgment > Entitlement as Matter of Law > Genuine\n  Disputes\n  Civil Procedure > ... > Summary Judgment > Entitlement as Matter of Law > Materiality of\n  Facts\n\nHN1 On appeal from the granting of summary judgment, the court must determine\nwhether the evidence establishes as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact.

Agreements which demand performance at or\nfor a specified amount of time are easily determined by the court to fall or not fall under\nthe strictures of §26.01(b)(6). The court simply compares the date of the agreement to\nthe date when the performance under the agreement is to be completed and if there is\na year or more in between them then a writing is required to render the agreement\nenforceable.

App. LEXIS 900, **1\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n[*506] OPINION\nThis is a breach of contract case. At trial, appellant Geoffrey Young sought to enforce\nan oral contract between him and appellee Travis Ward whereby Ward, Young’s former\nemployer, had allegedly agreed to pay Young a pension of $ 2000 per month for the rest\nof [*507] Young’s life. Ward moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the\nalleged oral contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds. TEX. BUS. &\nCOMM. CODE ANN. § 26.01 (Vernon 1987). The trial court granted the motion,\nprompting Young to bring this appeal. We reverse and remand.\nThe two parties differ widely in their versions of the events which led to this lawsuit.\nAccording to Young, beginning in 1956 and continuing until the end of October 1985,\nYoung worked for Ward as an office manager and bookkeeper. Starting [**2] in or about\n1969, he began to feel concerned that Ward had not yet established some provision for\nhis retirement income. He, therefore, brought the subject up to Ward, who assured\nYoung that he had no need to be concerned about a lack of a retirement income and that\nWard would provide one for Young when the time came. Nevertheless, despite repeated\nprotests from Young, Ward never attempted to finalize a formal agreement with Young\nuntil either late September or early October of 1985 when Young was only a few weeks\nfrom his last day of employment. At that time, again according to Young, Ward offered\nto pay Young $ 2000 per month for the rest of Young’s life. Young argues that the\nconsideration for the agreement was that Young would continue to work for Ward until\nthe end of October. The negotiations were oral and the agreement was never reduced to\nwriting.\nWard agrees that Young worked for him from 1956 until the end of October 1985 as an\noffice manager and bookkeeper, but this essentially is where the similarity between his\nstory and Young’s ends. According to Ward, his decision to offer Young a pension arose\nfrom an effort to keep Young in his employment when Ward was relocating [**3] his\noffices from Corsicana to Dallas sometime between 1971 and 1973, not from concerns\nexpressed by Young about a lack of a retirement plan. Young did not want to move to\nDallas and was reluctant to commute; accordingly, in an effort to persuade him to\ncontinue in his employment, Ward offered to provide Young a company car and gas so\nthat Young could make the commute from Corsicana without any financial expense.\nFurthermore, as an added incentive, Ward decided to offer Young a retirement plan.\nWard consulted an insurance agent, Gara Stark, who analyzed certain figures and\noffered certain suggestions to Ward on what might be feasible Options for him and\nYoung. Ward decided not to accept any of the suggestions from Stark; instead, he orally\noffered to pay Young $ 2000 per month for eight years once Young retired. According\nto Ward, Young orally accepted this offer in 1973, but it was never reduced to writing.\n                                 Jamie Graham Page 5 of 12\n\f                        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1723627\"><a href=\"/opinion/1723627/young-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *507; 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 900, **3\n\n\n\nThe parties agree that Young retired at the end of October 1985 and that Ward paid\nYoung $ 2000 per month for eight years following Young’s retirement. Young brought\nhis lawsuit when Ward informed him in or about October 1993 that he would cease\nmaking payments to Young the following [**4] month.\nIn his motion for summary judgment, Ward contended the oral agreement between him\nand Young was unenforceable because it was not to be performed within one year from\nthe date of the making of the agreement, as provided in our state’s statute of frauds.\nTEX. BUS. & COMM. CODE ANN. § 26.01(b)(6). Ward raised two arguments in\nsupport of his theory: first, he contended that any contract for lifetime is, per se, barred\nby the statute of frauds; second, he argued that, since the date of the contract’s making\nwas in 1973, more than one year would necessarily have had to elapse before the\ncontract could be performed because Young was not due to retire until twelve years later\nin 1985. The trial court granted summary judgment solely on the former argument;\nconsequently, we can only consider it and not the latter. State Farm Fire & Cas.

Gilliam, 340 S.W.2d at 28-9; Chevalier, 213 S.W.2d at\n532. Section 26.01(b)(6) refers to agreements which cannot be ″performed″ within one\nyear of their making. TEX. BUS. & COMM.

Bratcher, 346 S.W.2d at 796; Gilliam, 340 S.W.2d at\n28-9; Chevalier, 213 S.W.2d at 532; Gerstacker, 884 S.W.2d at 851 (employment\ncontract for as long as the employee’s performance was satisfactory would be fully\ncompleted when employee’s performance became unsatisfactory); Portilla, 836 S.W.2d\nat 670-71 (same). But if the occurrence of some other contingent event, even if\nexpressly contemplated in the agreement, would simply terminate the agreement before\nthe agreement had been fully performed, then the possibility of that terminating event\noccurring within one year of the agreement’s making is insufficient to take the\nagreement outside of section 26.01(b)(6). The event that could conceivably occur within\none year of the agreement must be one intended by the parties to result in the full\nperformance of the agreement. In the words of the Fifth Circuit, ″If an oral . . .\nagreement can cease upon some contingency, other than by some fortuitous event or the\ndeath of one of the parties, the agreement may be performed within one year, and the\nstatute of frauds does [**19] not apply.″ Pruitt v.

Datascope, 745 S.W.2d at 544. We will now apply\nthe facts to the above-stated principles of law.\nHere, the summary judgment evidence indicates that the parties agreed in late\nSeptember or early October 1985 that Ward would pay Young $ 2000 per month for the\nrest of Young’s life if Young would work for Ward until the end of October 1985. We\nnote that there are two stages of performance under this agreement. The first is the\nmonth and a half of work Young would have to complete in order to be entitled to\npayment from Ward. The parties identified a specific and definite period of time by\nwhich performance under this first stage would be completed; i.e., no more than a month\nand a half. This month and a half would necessarily expire within one year of the\nagreement’s making; therefore, the writing requirement of section 26.01(b)(6) is not\ninvoked by this stage.\nThe second stage of performance is the period of time Ward was required to make\npayments to Young. This period was one of an [**20] indefinite duration; i.e., until\n                                 Jamie Graham Page 11 of 12\n\f                       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1723627\"><a href=\"/opinion/1723627/young-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *511; 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 900, **20\n\n\n\nYoung dies. As an agreement of indefinite duration, we must ask whether it could have\nbeen fully performed within one year of its making. Obviously, it could have been.\nYoung could have died at any time after he ceased working for Ward.\nWe must also ask, however, whether Young’s death would have resulted in the\nagreement being fully performed or fortuitously terminated. The language of the [*512]\nagreement reveals the parties’ intention that the contract would be fully performed once\nYoung died, assuming he successfully performed under the first stage of the agreement,\nwhich we note was less than one year. Young’s death within a year of the agreement’s\nmaking would not have simply resulted in the fortuitous termination of the agreement:\nYoung’s death was intended by the parties to be the defining event which would\ndetermine when the agreement was fully performed. Therefore, because both stages of\nthe agreement, taken together, could have been fully performed within one year of the\nagreement’s making, we conclude that section 26.01(b)(6) is not applicable. We,\naccordingly, sustain Young’s first point of error. Due to our disposition of his first\n [**21] point of error, we need not consider his remaining points.
