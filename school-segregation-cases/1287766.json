R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311     Page: 2   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\n      In a longstanding pending desegregation case, the district court enjoined\ncertain non-party state actors (Appellants here) from implementing a recently\npassed statute with respect to the defendant parish school board.            The\nAppellants filed an emergency motion seeking to stay a portion of a preliminary\ninjunction pending appeal. On December 14, 2012, we granted a temporary stay\npending further order of this court. We note that this matter comes before us as\na motions panel only on the question of whether a stay pending appeal should\nbe granted. The motion was filed as an emergency motion, with limited time for\nbriefing and consideration. Under the posture of the case as presented to us, we\nare addressing only the question of whether the district court’s injunction order\nshould be stayed pending consideration of all arguments raised by the parties\n– jurisdictional and otherwise – following full briefing and, if appropriate, oral\nargument. In assessing whether to grant a stay, we necessarily must examine\nthe merits of the parties’ arguments. But, given the procedural posture of this\ncase, we emphasize that we do not intend to bind the ultimate merits panel\nwhich will consider the matter following full appellate process. Additionally, we\ndetermine that a full exposition of the law in this area is unnecessary and\ninappropriate at this stage, so we will endeavor to be brief in our reasoning. For\nthe reasons stated below, we now GRANT the Appellants’ motion and STAY the\ndistrict court’s order pending appeal.\n     I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n      The desegregation plaintiffs and the Tangipahoa Parish School Board (“the\nBoard”) (collectively, “the Petitioners”) filed motions for the issuance of writs\npursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), seeking injunctions against\nthe further implementation of certain provisions of Acts 1 and 2 of the 2012\nRegular Session of the Louisiana Legislature (“Act 1” and “Act 2”) based on their\nalleged interference with a court-ordered consent decree.        The underlying\nconsent decree arose from a 1965 federal desegregation suit, Moore v.\n\n                                         2\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nTangipahoa Parish School Board, in which the district court issued an order\nestablishing certain student assignment and facilities requirements aimed at\nassisting the Board in achieving unitary school system status.\n      The most relevant portion of the newly enacted law is the Student\nScholarships for Educational Excellence Act, LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§\n17:4011–:4025, implemented through Act 2. This Act creates a school-voucher\nor scholarship program (“the Program”) that allows students in Tangipahoa\nParish (“the Parish”) to attend alternative public or private educational\ninstitutions in lieu of attending their assigned underperforming public school in\nthe Parish. See LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 17:4013, :4018. When students elect to\nparticipate in the Program, Minimum Foundation Program (“MFP”) funds,\nwhich are state funds intended for public education, are diverted from the\nstudent’s assigned public school in the Parish to the alternative public or private\ninstitution where the student is educated. See id. § 17:4016. At present, fifty of\nthe approximately 20,000 students in the Parish are participating in the\nProgram. The Petitioners allege that compliance with the court-ordered consent\ndecree requires them to receive full MFP funding and that the Program’s\ndiversion of MFP funds frustrates their ability to implement the provisions of\nthe decree.\n      On October 22, 2012, the district court ordered John White, Louisiana\nSuperintendent of Education (“Superintendent White”), the Louisiana\nDepartment of Education (“the Department”), and the Louisiana Board of\nElementary and Secondary Education (“BESE”) (collectively, “the State”), “to\nshow cause . . . as to why a preliminary injunction should not be entered . . .\nenjoining and prohibiting . . . further implementation of [the Program in the\nParish].” The district court also ordered the State to show “why a mandatory\npreliminary injunction should not be entered . . . directing [the State] to\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 12-31218       Document: 00512111311         Page: 4     Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-31218\n\nimmediately commence full MFP funding to the [Board] for each student on a\nscholarship pursuant to the [Program].”\n       The State responded and during the November 26, 2012, hearing the\ndistrict court issued a preliminary injunction.1 As instructed by the court, the\nPetitioners and the State submitted proposed orders consistent with the court’s\noral reasons. On November 28, 2012, the district court entered the Petitioners’\nproposed order thereby enjoining the Program in the Parish.\n       The next day, the court denied the State’s request for a stay of the\npreliminary injunction pending appeal. The State timely moved this court to\nstay a portion of the preliminary injunction. See FED. R. APP. P. 8(a)(1)(C).\n       At the same time that the federal district court injunction process was\nongoing, a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Program was pending\nin a Louisiana state trial court. That case examines the validity of the Program\nunder the Louisiana state constitution. See La. Fed’n of Teachers v. Louisiana,\nNo. 612,733, slip op. at 2 (19th La. Dist. Nov. 30, 2012). The state trial court\nfound that the Program violates the state constitution by diverting public funds\nfrom the state’s public schools to private entities. See id. This ruling may be\ndirectly appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court and, as discussed below, could\nrender this federal action moot.\n                            II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       We review a district court’s denial of a stay pending appeal for abuse of\ndiscretion. See Wildmon v. Berwick Universal Pictures, 983 F.2d 21, 23 (5th Cir.\n1992); see also Beverly v. United States, 468 F.2d 732, 740 n.13 (5th Cir. 1972)\n\n\n       1\n        The district court enjoined the Student Scholarships for Educational Excellence Act,\nLA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 17:4011–:4025, the Course Choice Program, LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§\n17:4002.1–:4002.6, and certain provisions of Act 1, which focus on teacher tenure and\naccountability. Because the State requests a stay of the injunction only as it pertains to the\nProgram administered pursuant to the Student Scholarships for Educational Excellence Act,\nwe do not consider whether the injunction should be stayed as to these other provisions.\n\n                                              4\n\f     Case: 12-31218      Document: 00512111311         Page: 5    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-31218\n\n(“[T]he accepted standard for review of such a stay is whether or not the trial\ncourt abused its sound discretion in denying the stay.”).                The factors for\nevaluating the appropriateness of a stay pending appeal are well-established:\n“(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured\nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other\nparties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”\nHilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987); see also Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S.\n418, 426 (2009).\n       “The first two factors of the traditional standard are the most critical.”\nNken, 556 U.S. at 434. As the movant for a stay pending appeal, the State\ncarries the burden to satisfy the four factors, see Ruiz v. Estelle, 666 F.2d 854,\n856 (5th Cir. 1982), and it is not entitled to the stay as a matter of right. See\nNken, 556 U.S. at 433.\n                                  III. DISCUSSION\n       We conclude that the State has met its burden of establishing that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying the stay of the preliminary\ninjunction.2\n       A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n       The State must make “a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the\nmerits.” Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776. In assessing this standard, “the movant need\nnot always show a ‘probability’ of success on the merits.” Ruiz v. Estelle, 650\nF.2d 555, 565 (5th Cir. 1981) (citation omitted). “[I]nstead, the [State] need only\npresent a substantial case on the merits when a serious legal question is\n\n\n       2\n        As discussed above, this appeal presents an emergency motion to stay, which is being\ndecided on an abbreviated briefing schedule and within a limited time. We apply only the\nstandard governing whether a stay of the preliminary injunction should be granted.\nAccordingly, nothing in our opinion should be read as an intent to bind the merits panel\ndetermining whether the district court appropriately issued the injunction.\n\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 6   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\ninvolved and show that the balance of the equities weighs heavily in favor of\ngranting the stay.” Id.; see also Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (noting that the movant\nmust show “[m]ore than a mere possibility of relief”).             The State has\ndemonstrated that it is likely to succeed in establishing that the district court\nimproperly issued the preliminary injunction based on several grounds\nincluding: (1) the district court’s lack of jurisdiction under the Eleventh\nAmendment; (2) the Pullman abstention doctrine; and (3) the lack of evidence\nestablishing authority for the court to act pursuant to the All Writs Act.\n      1. Lack of Jurisdiction Based on Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n      The State has a strong likelihood of prevailing on its claim that the district\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction because its\nexercise of authority violated the State’s Eleventh Amendment sovereign\nimmunity. Absent a waiver of immunity by a state or through a federal statute,\nthe Eleventh Amendment protects states from suit in federal court regardless\nof whether the suit seeks damages or injunctive relief. Pennhurst State Sch. &\nHosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100-01 (1984); see also Quern v. Jordan, 440\nU.S. 332, 337 (1979) (noting that this immunity guards a state from “a suit in\nfederal court by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid\nfrom public funds.”). “This bar remains in effect when State officials are sued\nfor damages in their official capacity” because “a judgment against a public\nservant in his official capacity imposes liability on the entity that he represents.”\nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 169 (1985) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted); see also Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974) (“It is\nalso well established that even though a State is not named a party to the action,\nthe suit may nonetheless be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.”).\n      The principle of state sovereign immunity also prohibits subdivisions of a\nstate from seeking relief against state defendants in federal court. Harris v.\nAngelina Cnty., Tex., 31 F.3d 331, 339 (5th Cir. 1994). Indeed, “we can think of\n\n                                         6\n\f    Case: 12-31218      Document: 00512111311      Page: 7   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\nfew greater intrusions on state sovereignty than requiring a state to respond, in\nfederal court, to a claim for contribution brought by one of its own\n[subdivisions].” Id. at 340 (citation omitted); see also Stanley v. Darlington Cnty.\nSch. Dist., 84 F.3d 707, 716 (4th Cir. 1996) (“It would be an unfathomable\nintrusion into a state’s affairs—and a violation of the most basic notions of\nfederalism—for a federal court to determine the allocation of a state’s financial\nresources. The legislative debate over such allocation is uniquely an exercise of\nstate sovereignty.”). In general, then, federal courts do not interfere in a state’s\ndisputes with its own political subdivisions.\n      Here, Petitioners seek injunctive relief against two state agencies, the\nDepartment and BESE. Further, there is no claim that Superintendent White\nhas violated federal law or acted outside of his official capacity, and the State is\nnot a party to the consent decree. Accordingly, there is a significant likelihood\nthat the State can show the preliminary injunction offends Eleventh\nAmendment immunity because an injunction against the Department, BESE,\nor Superintendent White is effectively an injunction against the State.\n      The Petitioners’ statements in their briefing to the district court reveal the\ntrue nature of their complaint.       Specifically, the Board seeks to avoid “a\nreduction in MFP funding” because “[t]he school board is in need of funding now”\nand it “can ill afford to have the state reduce its share of MFP funding.” These\nstatements show that the Board does not seek an injunction to prevent violations\nof federal law, but instead seeks such relief in order to prevent the\nimplementation of the state legislature’s decisions concerning education funding,\na quintessentially state issue. They also show that the essence of the relief\nsought is not injunctive but rather monetary – enjoining the State from “failing\nto pay” is little less than telling the State to pay.\n      In addition to requiring the State to address legislative decisions about\nstate funding in federal court, the district court thus required the State to\n\n                                          7\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311          Page: 8   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nrespond to what is essentially a contribution claim by one of its own\nsubdivisions. Such disputes concerning the allocation of the state’s financial\nresources fall within the purview of a state’s sovereign power, and requiring a\nstate to answer a claim for contribution – however disguised – from one of its\nown subdivisions violates its Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Harris, 31\nF.3d at 340; see also Kelley v. Metro. Cnty. Bd. of Educ. of Nashville & Davidson\nCnty., Tenn., 836 F.2d 986, 998 (6th Cir. 1987) (federal courts should not\n“adjudicate an internal dispute [concerning funding for a desegregation order]\nbetween a local governmental entity and the very state that created it.”).\nIndeed, a school district cannot recover funds expended in compliance with a\ndesegregation order when the state is not a party to the desegregation order. See\nUnited States v. Tex. Educ. Agency, 790 F.2d 1262, 1264-65 (5th Cir. 1986). Such\nattempts to recover funding from a state ostensibly to comply with a\ndesegregation order to which it is not a party “smacks of an attempted end-run\naround the [state] legislature’s allocation of state funds.” Id. at 1265.\n      The   district   court   justified       the   issuance   of   the   preliminary\ninjunction—which essentially serves as an award of monetary relief against the\nState’s treasury—by noting that the Supreme Court “has curbed [the limitation\nproscribing an award of money damages] in the case of a federal court giving\nprospective injunctive relief against a state officer even though compliance with\nthe injunction will cost the state money in the future.” A district court is not\nfree to interfere in state spending decisions simply because raising and lowering\nfunding levels may have some incidental impact on a federal decree. The\ninjunction here is not aimed at preventing direct interference with a court-\nordered consent decree, but instead bars state officials from implementing a\nstate’s program and funding decisions because of their attenuated connection to\na consent decree. Unlike the cases relied on by the district court, this matter\ndoes not involve a party seeking a state official’s compliance with federal law\n\n                                           8\n\f     Case: 12-31218       Document: 00512111311           Page: 9    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-31218\n\nthat will indirectly cost the state more money. See, e.g., Quern, 440 U.S. at 336,\n349 (federal court has jurisdiction to order state officials to send notification to\nclass plaintiffs of the availability of an administrative remedy to recover public\nbenefits); Edelman, 415 U.S. at 668 (finding a federal court cannot require the\n“payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance in the\nfuture with a substantive federal-question determination”). Furthermore the\ndistrict court’s reliance on Milliken v. Bradley is misplaced because, unlike here,\nthe state in Milliken was a party to the original desegregation order and was\nfound to be partially responsible for the segregation. 433 U.S. 267, 269, 289-90\n(1977) (finding that federal court has jurisdiction to allocate costs between state\nand local officials when ordering a school desegregation plan).\n       Put another way, the gravamen of Petitioners’ claims is an attempt to\navoid decreases in education funding. Masking it as a concern about compliance\nwith the district court’s desegregation order does not change the fundamental\nnature of the injunction as one directly affecting a state’s sovereign decision-\nmaking about state spending. This approach, then, conflicts with the State’s\nsovereign immunity by requiring it to answer what is essentially a claim for\ncontribution from one of its subdivisions in federal court. Accordingly, the State\nhas a strong likelihood of success in showing that the district court’s issuance of\nthe preliminary injunction violated the State’s Eleventh Amendment sovereign\nimmunity.3\n              2. Pullman Abstention\n\n\n       3\n           The extent of the Board’s argument concerning this issue on appeal lies in its\nassertion that the injunction does not run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment to the extent that\nit enjoins “John White in his official capacity.” The Board does not cite any authority for this\nconclusion. The fact that Superintendent White is enjoined in his official capacity does not\ncure the potential affront to Eleventh Amendment immunity in this matter. See Kentucky v.\nGraham, 473 U.S. 159, 169 (1985); see also Kelley, 836 F.2d at 989 (“The applicability of the\nbar of sovereign immunity simply is not affected by the circumstance that the nominal\ndefendant is an individual state official . . . .” (citation omitted)).\n\n                                               9\n\f    Case: 12-31218        Document: 00512111311          Page: 10     Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-31218\n\n       “[T]he Supreme Court [has] ‘instructed federal courts that the principles\nof equity, comity, and federalism in certain circumstances counsel abstention in\ndeference to ongoing state proceedings.’” See Wightman v. Tex. Supreme Court,\n84 F.3d 188, 189 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting Fieger v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 740, 743 (6th\nCir. 1996)). Based on the application of this principle in Railroad Commission\nv. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941), the State is likely to prevail in its claim\nthat the district court should not have exercised jurisdiction in light of the\npending state-court action challenging the validity of the Program under\nLouisiana’s constitution.4\n       A federal court should generally abstain from exercising jurisdiction in a\nmatter when an unsettled area of state law has an effect on the outcome of a\nfederal constitutional claim or would render a decision on the federal issue\nunnecessary. Pullman, 312 U.S. at 496; see, e.g., Askew v. Hargrave, 401 U.S.\n476, 478 (1971) (explaining that when the outcome of a case in state court could\nremove the need to decide a federal issue a federal court should stay the\nproceeding until the state court has rendered judgment). Although “abstention\n[i]s applicable only in narrowly limited special circumstances,” the doctrine\nshould be applied when “[a] state court decision . . . could conceivably avoid any\ndecision [of the federal question] and would avoid any possible irritant in the\nfederal-state relationship.” Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, 86-87 (1970) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.\nChurch, Inc. v. Morales, 986 F.2d 962, 967 (5th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted)\n(“Pullman abstention . . . is addressed to the inappropriateness of federal court\n\n       4\n         Because we conclude that Pullman abstention is appropriate, we need not address the\nabstention doctrine applied in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). Younger abstention\napplies when: “(1) the dispute . . . involve[s] an ongoing state judicial proceeding, (2) an\nimportant state interest in the subject matter of the proceeding [is] implicated, and (3) the\nstate proceedings . . . afford an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges.” Tex.\nAss’n of Bus. v.

This doctrine “[i]s based on ‘the avoidance of needless friction’\nbetween federal pronouncements and state policies.” Reetz, 397 U.S. at 87\n(quoting Pullman, 312 U.S. at 500).\n      This matter presents the very conflict that Pullman abstention seeks to\navoid—i.e., “‘needless friction’ between [a] federal pronouncement[] and state\npolicies”—as it involves a federal court enjoining a state’s legislatively-\ndetermined funding decisions prior to allowing the state to consider whether\nsuch decisions comport with its own constitution. See id. The State thus has\nshown a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits of its claim that Pullman\nabstention applies because the resolution of an unsettled area of state\nlaw—whether the Program’s transfer of public-education funds to non-public\nschools offends Louisiana’s state constitution—could obviate the need to consider\nthe federal issue of whether the Program renders the Petitioners unable to\ncomply with the court-ordered consent decree. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nUnauthorized Practice of Law Comm., 283 F.3d 650, 653 (5th Cir. 2002). Such\na result is certainly possible in light of a recent decision by a Louisiana district\ncourt holding that the Program violates the state constitution. See La. Fed’n of\nTeachers, No. 612,733, slip op. at 2.\n      In sum, the Petitioners’ claims that the Program interferes with the\nconsent decree are “‘entangled in a skein of state law that must be untangled\nbefore the federal case can proceed[.]’” See Harris Cnty. Comm’rs Court v.\nMoore, 420 U.S. 77, 88 (1975) (quoting McNeese v. Bd. of Educ., 373 U.S. 668,\n674 (1963)). Accordingly, the State has a strong likelihood of establishing that\nthe district court erred in exercising jurisdiction in light of the Pullman\nabstention doctrine.\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311       Page: 12   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\n            3. Lack of Evidence Establishing Authority to Act Pursuant to the\n               All Writs Act\n      Examining the proceedings in the district court prior to issuance of the\ninjunction, we are further persuaded of the State’s likelihood of success on the\nmerits based on the district court’s lack of authority to act pursuant to the All\nWrits Act, which serves as the district court’s self-proclaimed basis for\njurisdiction. The All Writs Act provides “power [to] a federal court to issue such\ncommands . . . as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the\nfrustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction\notherwise obtained.” United States v. N.Y. Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172 (1977); see\nalso 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). As the district court appropriately recognized, this\npower may be applied to individuals or entities that were not parties in the\nunderlying litigation when their conduct frustrates the court’s order. See N.Y.\nTel., 434 U.S. at 174 (citation omitted). “This authority, though, ‘is firmly\ncircumscribed, its scope depend[s] on the nature of the case before the court and\nthe legitimacy of the ends sought to be achieved through the exercise of the\npower.’” Netsphere, Inc. v. Baron, No. 10-11202, 2012 WL 6583058, at *6 (5th\nCir. Dec. 18, 2012) (quoting ITT Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Barton, 569 F.2d 1351,\n1358-59 (5th Cir. 1978)).\n      Three elements must be satisfied for a district court to act pursuant to this\nstatute, and the burden of establishing them in the district court is on the\nPetitioners. See Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004).\nFirst, “the party seeking issuance of the writ [must] have no other adequate\nmeans to attain the relief he desires.” Id. (alteration in original) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).       When alternative means of relief are\navailable, the court should not issue a writ. See, e.g., Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S.\nMarshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985) (finding the use of the All Writs Act to\ncompel transportation of prisoners was inappropriate because “[a]lthough that\n\n\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 13    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nAct empowers federal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need\narises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance\nwith statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.”). Here, the\nPetitioners have alternative means of relief apart from reliance on a writ. In\naddition to seeking relief from the state legislature in the form of additional\nfunding or repeal of the Program, the Petitioners may avail themselves of relief\nin state court. In fact, proceedings in the state court already suggest that\nalternative relief would be available in light of a recent decision from a state\ndistrict court holding that the Program’s disbursement of education funds to\nprivate institutions violates Louisiana’s state constitution. See La. Fed’n of\nTeachers, No. 612,733, slip op. at 2.\n      Second, the party seeking the writ must meet its “burden of showing that\n[its] right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.” Cheney, 542 U.S. at\n381 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The State has a strong\nargument that the Petitioners have not established their “clear and\nindisputable” right to the writ.     Generally, a writ is appropriate when it\naddresses a direct affront to a district court’s order. See, e.g., United States v.\nHall, 472 F.2d 261, 262-64 (5th Cir. 1972) (finding an injunction under the All\nWrits Act proper in the desegregation context to prevent a member of a militant\ngroup from intentionally violating a court order denying his entry into a high\nschool campus).\n      Petitioners contend that the Board faces a large, general budget shortfall\nand that any decrease in funding due to students electing to attend schools other\nthan their assigned public school will adversely affect its “ability to implement”\nthe requirements of the consent decree. In the district court, Petitioners had the\nburden to provide evidence to support their contentions. Instead, the Board\npresented general financial data and budgets that provide a general and\nsuperficial overview of the school’s funding mechanism, as well as a few specific\n\n                                        13\n\f    Case: 12-31218        Document: 00512111311          Page: 14      Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-31218\n\nbudget needs that are unrelated to schools affected by the Program.5 The Board\nfurther relies on affidavits from administrators at two of the private schools\nparticipating in the Program to suggest that these schools intend to expand,\nwhich in turn will adversely affect the Board’s ability to implement the consent\ndecree. This evidence—based merely on general financial information and\nspeculation that the Program will eventually expand to a point that causes them\nharm—fails to demonstrate immediate irreparable harm warranting relief.6 See\nHolland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, 777 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir. 1985)\n(“Speculative injury is not sufficient; there must be more than an unfounded fear\non the part of the applicant.” (citation omitted)). The “evidence” was nothing\nmore than a generalized concern that an already cash-strapped school board\nwould find itself with fewer resources.              No specifics about the particular\ndecreases and the particular impact was provided to the district court.\n       Third, assuming the petition meets the first two requirements, a court\nshould exercise discretion before issuing a writ to ensure it “is appropriate under\nthe circumstances.” Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381 (citation omitted). The All Writs\nAct does not grant blanket authority to enjoin state conduct in matters related\nto a state’s funding of its subdivisions. Instead, the authority under the All\nWrits Act “is to be used sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent\n\n\n       5\n           For instance, in its Reply Memorandum and Listing of Supporting Documentation\nfiled in the district court on November 19, 2012, the Board included an exhibit discussing the\nprojected costs to improve the Kentwood High School facility. Kentwood High School,\nhowever, is not one of the “assigned schools” or “last attending school” for any of the fifty\nstudents participating in the Program.\n       6\n         Indeed, the little evidence presented is to the contrary. Prior to filing its Motion for\nIssuance of Writs, the Board requested a modification of the consent decree to authorize\napproximately $1.4 million of improvements to five schools, none of which are the “assigned\nschool” or the “last attending school” of the fifty students enrolled in the Program. This\nmodification of the consent decree is significant because it suggests that while the Board\nclaims it cannot sustain the loss of MFP funding associated with the Program, the Board’s\nbudget still allows it to modify the consent to decree in order to receive authorization to\nallocate additional money to schools unaffected by the Program.\n\n                                               14\n\f    Case: 12-31218        Document: 00512111311          Page: 15      Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-31218\n\ncircumstances.” Wisc. Right to Life, Inc. v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 542 U.S. 1305,\n1306 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n       The State has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the\nmerits of the argument that the district court’s reliance on the All Writs Act was\nnot appropriate based on the circumstances. Petitioners’ arguments during the\nNovember 26 district court hearing suggest nothing more than that the Program\nfrustrates the consent decree by interfering with their calculations based on\nprojections in school growth and student attendance. It is difficult to imagine,\nhowever, that the Program, which affects less than one quarter of one percent\nof the Parish’s students, will have a substantial enough effect on the Board’s\ncalculations to warrant the “extraordinary remedies” provided by the All Writs\nAct.\n       The Board’s rationale leads to the conclusion that whenever a state\nlegislature’s actions result in an indirect reduction in education funding a\nfederal court can enjoin the implementation of the funding decision so long as\nthe party seeking the writ merely shows that it is in need of funding or that a\nchange in funding could limit its financial resources. Such a broad use of\nauthority is not compatible with the Supreme Court’s admonition that the All\nWrits Act is an extraordinary form of relief.7\n\n\n       B. Irreparable Harm\n\n\n       7\n          The district court also purported to act pursuant to its inherent powers. The cases\nrelied upon by the district court in the exercise of this power, however, involved the\nenforcement of consent decrees against parties who agreed to be bound by the decrees. See\ne.g., Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 435-36 (2004) (enforcing consent decree\nagainst state officials who were parties to the original decree); United States v. City of Miami,\nFla., 664 F.2d 435, 436 (5th Cir. 1981) (limiting the effect of a consent decree on a party who\ndid not agree to the decree). Accordingly, even if the Board presented adequate evidence that\nthe Program conflicted with the consent decree, the All Writs Act—and not the court’s\ninherent power—would serve as the proper source of authority to protect a consent decree from\nthe actions of a non-party to the decree.\n\n                                               15\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 16   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\n      The irreparable injury to the State caused by the preliminary injunction\nweighs in favor of a stay pending appeal. See Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776. As the\nState points out, the immediate implementation of the injunction will cause\nirreparable harm to the fifty students participating in the Program because the\nfailure to make timely scholarship payments to the students’ schools would\nresult in the children having to relocate during the school year. This result\nwould frustrate the State’s program thereby causing harm to it and the students\nthat the State seeks to serve. The injunction causes further direct irreparable\nharm against the State as it deprives the State of the opportunity to implement\nits own legislature’s decisions concerning education funding and forces it to\nanswer for claims in federal court that are likely barred by Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.\n      C. Substantial Injury to Petitioners and Public Interest\n      The factors discussed above—a substantial likelihood of success on the\nmerits and the irreparable harm to the State—are the most important. Nken,\n556 U.S. at 434. The final two factors—the potential for substantial injury to the\nPetitioners and the public interest—are less significant in our analysis. We\nrecognize that the Board may face an injury if it is unable to comply with the\nconsent decree, which could affect its ability to become a unitary school system.\nThe evidence presented in the district court, however, belies the claim of injury\nto the Petitioners, at least at this point.\n      Finally, the public interest factor leans in favor of the State. Enjoining a\nState from implementing its own law while an appeal is pending before a federal\ncourt invokes significant concerns related to principles of federalism and comity.\nThese concerns are especially significant here where the State is enjoined from\nimplementing its education funding due to an appeal of a federal court action\ninvolving claims for which the State is likely entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.\n\n                                         16\n\f   Case: 12-31218   Document: 00512111311     Page: 17   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                               No. 12-31218\n\n                            IV. CONCLUSION\n     For the reasons discussed above, we GRANT the Appellants’ motion to\nSTAY a portion of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    17\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311       Page: 18   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nDENNIS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n      In the motion before us, the movant state officials, the Louisiana Board of\nElementary and Secondary Education (“BESE”), the Louisiana Department of\nEducation, and John White, State Superintendent of Education (collectively, “the\nState Officials”), have requested and are clearly entitled to have this court\nreverse the district court’s judgment and direct that court to abstain from\nfurther proceedings pending a potentially dispositive decision by the Louisiana\nSupreme Court in accordance with Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312\nU.S. 496 (1941).     The majority recognizes that the criteria for Pullman\nabstention have been satisfied but nevertheless refuses to refrain from\ncontinuing this federal litigation, to reverse the district court’s judgment, and to\norder federal-court abstention in this case. I emphatically disagree. A state trial\ncourt has declared the school-voucher law unconstitutional under the Louisiana\nState Constitution, that decision has been appealed directly to the Louisiana\nSupreme Court, and the state’s highest court will resolve that state\nconstitutional issue soon.    Accordingly, because the parties, and even the\nmajority, agree that a Louisiana Supreme Court affirmance of the state trial\ncourt’s judgment will moot this federal litigation entirely, I respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority’s refusal to reverse the district court’s judgment and order it\nto abide by Pullman abstention. There is no good reason for the continuation of\nthis (potentially unnecessary) federal litigation at this time. We are qualified\nand able to make a decision regarding Pullman, we unanimously agree that the\ncriteria for that abstention have been satisfied, and the rationale underlying\nthat doctrine—reducing friction between the federal and state judiciaries when\nimportant questions of state law are involved—calls strongly for the doctrine’s\ninvocation here.\n      Aside from the majority’s unfortunate decision to continue this federal\nlitigation even though it concedes that Pullman abstention should be ordered,\n\n                                        18\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 19    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nI also disagree strongly with the majority’s erroneous reasoning in granting a\nstay of the district court’s judgment pending appeal.         First, the majority\nincorrectly assumes that the doctrines of Pullman abstention and Eleventh\nAmendment sovereign immunity from federal suit may be invoked—not to\nterminate or halt this litigation—to enhance the State Officials’ likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits in the stay-pending-appeal analysis. This assumption is\nplainly wrong. Those independent doctrines may be used to end or suspend a\nfederal suit but not to enhance its likelihood of success on the merits on appeal\nfor stay purposes. Second, the majority not only abuses process by refusing to\ninvoke Pullman immediately but also incorrectly decides that the State Officials\nwill be able to invoke Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal suit before\nthe merits panel in this appeal. As the State Officials concede in their motion,\nhowever, the State of Louisiana is not a party of record or otherwise involved in\nthe underlying litigation. Rather, in this case, the district court, enforcing its\nforty-five-year-old consent decree and desegregation order against the\nTangipahoa Parish School Board, prospectively enjoined the State Officials from\nexecuting and applying a state law so as to violate the federal constitution by\nfrustrating, interfering with, and threatening to dismantle the desegregation\norder, based on the Fourteenth Amendment and Brown v. Board of Education,\nthat requires and establishes terms and conditions for the conversion of the\nparish public-school system from a racially discriminatory dual system to a\nconstitutionally unitary system. It is well settled that prospective injunctive\nrelief against state officers, as opposed to the state per se, which bars them from\nviolations of the federal constitution or laws, does not contravene state sovereign\nimmunity from federal court suits. See, e.g., Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267,\n289-90 (1977); Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Third, the majority errs in\nits conclusion that the district court misused the All Writs Act to issue the\npreliminary injunction against the State Officials. Finally, a correct application\n\n                                        19\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311     Page: 20     Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nof the factors to be considered for a stay pending appeal under Nken v. Holder,\n556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009), shows clearly that the State Officials are not entitled\nto a stay of the district court’s judgment pending appeal, even if the majority\nerroneously refuses to order federal-court abstention under Pullman.\n                                BACKGROUND\n      In 1967, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, then engaged in\noverseeing the desegregation of numerous school districts in the South, laid\ndown the following requirement in an en banc decision: “[t]he defendants shall\nprovide remedial education programs which permit students attending or who\nhave previously attended segregated schools to overcome past inadequacies in\ntheir education.” United States v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 380 F.2d 385, 394\n(5th Cir. 1967) (en banc). That same year, the District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana, in Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish School Board, adopted a\nschool-desegregation    consent   decree     finding   that   system    to   be   an\nunconstitutional racially dual system and required the school board to convert\nit to a unitary non-racially discriminatory system. See 290 F. Supp. 96, 96 (E.D.\nLa. 1968) (citing Brown and Jefferson County). On March 4, 2010, following a\nseries of earlier modifications, the district court, pursuant to the consent decree\nand after hearings and discussions with interested parties, issued an order (Rec.\nDoc. No. 876) establishing a desegregation order, under which the Tangipahoa\nParish School Board, when it reached full compliance, would achieve unitary\nschool-system status and obviate the need for further judicial supervision. To\nthis end, the consent decree and order detailed numerous obligations with which\nthe school board must comply, including: the construction of new schools and the\nenhancement of existing facilities; the creation of new magnet programs; new\nteacher assignments, certifications, and training; reporting and monitoring\nrequirements to ensure compliance with the court’s order, and the design and\nimplementation of a parish-wide school taxing district for the issuance of debt\n\n                                        20\n\f   Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 21   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nto finance capital improvements. Furthermore, the district court’s order detailed\na student-assignment plan predicated on the ordered expenditures detailed\nabove and expressly assumed receipt of MFP funding to satisfy the obligations\nimposed. See Doc. 876.\n      Subsequently, the Louisiana Legislature enacted Acts 1 and 2 of the 2012\nRegular Session establishing a school-voucher program authorizing the\ndisbursement of public funds, diverted from Minimum Foundation Program\n(“MFP”) funding, to enable eligible schoolchildren to leave Tangipahoa Parish\npublic schools to attend private, or non-public, schools of their choice. See LA.\nREV. STAT. § 17:4016. The MFP is a fund of public money dedicated to public\nprimary and secondary school education and determined by collaboration\nbetween the legislature and the BESE. It is then distributed according to a\nformula also derived from that collaboration to each of the sixty-nine public\nschool systems in the state. Importantly, the provisions of the Louisiana State\nConstitution do not authorize the legislature to unilaterally alter the dedication\nor the distribution formula. See LA. CONST. art. VIII, § 13(B); La. Fed’n of\nTeachers v. Louisiana, No.612,733, Slip Op. at 22-34 (19th. Dist. Nov. 30, 2012).\n      MFP funding, in conjunction with the operation of Act 2, is a zero-sum\nexercise such that MFP money, intended for public-school use, diverted for use\nby non-public schools deprives public-school districts such as Tangipahoa of the\nuse of such funds. Currently, during the first year of the voucher program, fifty\nchildren in Tangipahoa Parish receive school-voucher funds and attend non-\npublic schools. However, this number will surely grow as non-public schools\nexpand and new non-public schools are opened. In particular, the district court\nobserved that thirty-two of Tangipahoa’s public schools—representing a\n“considerable” number of students in the district—currently receive “C,” “D,” or\n“F” grades, entitling students at those schools to receive a voucher enabling\nthem to attend school elsewhere. Reimbursement for such vouchers comes from\n\n                                       21\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 22   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nMFP funding the public schools would otherwise receive and, furthermore,\ncorresponds with private-school tuition, which a private school is free to increase\nshould it so desire. Doc. 1066, at 13 n.2. Thus, the district court determined\nthat Act 2 threatens to undermine the Tangipahoa Parish desegregation consent\ndecree and the unitary school system plan of conversion by interfering with the\ncourt-mandated obligations laid out in the 2010 consent decree.\n      On September 24, 2012, the desegregation plaintiffs and the Tangipahoa\nParish School Board filed a “Motion for Issuance of Writs Pursuant to the All\nWrits Act” (Doc. 1021, Exhibit “D”) to enjoin the State Officials’ implementation\nof section 17:4016 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, which provides for a local-\nshare allocation in the calculation of funding to city and parish school systems\nfor students in Tangipahoa Parish attending non-public schools under the\nschool-voucher program. The Tangipahoa Parish School Board claims that the\nschool voucher program’s diversion of enrollment and public funding to non-\npublic schools impedes the Board’s “ability to implement” the requirements of\nthe consent decree (Doc. 876) in the areas of student assignment and facilities.\n      On October 22, 2012, the district court issued an “Order and Reasons”\n(Doc. 1066, Exhibit “E”) compelling the State Officials to appear before the court\non October 30, 2012 and “show cause, if any they can, as to why a preliminary\ninjunction should not be entered herein restraining, enjoining and prohibiting\nthe State Officials’ further implementation of LA. R.S. § 17:4016 that otherwise\nwould off-set the Tangipahoa Parish School District’s local contribution against\nMinimum Foundation Program Funding to be allocated” to Tangipahoa and why\na mandatory preliminary injunction should not enter ordering the State Officials\nto immediately commence funding to Tangipahoa if the voucher-funds recipient-\nstudents return to public schools.\n      Following argument at a hearing on November 26, 2012, the district court\norally denied the State Officials’ motions, granted a preliminary injunction, and\n\n                                        22\n\f   Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 23    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\ninstructed the parties to submit proposed orders consistent with the court’s oral\nreasons. On November 28, 2012, the district court entered the Order proposed\nby the desegregation parties (Doc. 1063, Exhibit “B”) thus broadly enjoining the\nSchool Officials from implementing the school-voucher program in Tangipahoa\nParish.\n      The following day, November 29, 2012, the district court issued an Order\n(Doc. 1065, Exhibit “C”) denying the State Officials’ request for a stay pending\nappeal in part because “state law, not imposed by the preliminary injunction,\nprovides an available option for reallocating agency resources. See LA. R.S.\n24:653(F).” On November 30, 2012, the district court issued an “Order and\nWritten Reasons” (Doc. 1066, Exhibit “E”) denying the State Officials’ “Motion\nTo Set Aside the Granting of the Two All Writs Motions” (Plaintiffs’ Doc. 1031;\nDefendants’ Doc. 1021).\n      The State Officials, in accordance with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure, moved this court to stay a portion of the preliminary\ninjunction rendered November 28, 2012. Considering the time-sensitive issues\nraised herein, we granted a temporary stay pending further order of this court\nto allow us time to consider the parties’ motions and arguments and to act upon\nthem effectively and expeditiously.\n                                 DISCUSSION\n               A. Pullman Abstention Should Be Ordered\n      As this court has noted, “Pullman abstention[] . . . is addressed to . . . the\nundesirability of reaching constitutional questions that might be mooted by the\napplication of state law.” Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc. v.\nMorales, 986 F.2d 962, 967 (5th Cir. 1993). For instance, “[w]here there is an\naction pending in state court that will likely resolve the state-law questions\nunderlying the federal claim, [the Supreme Court has] regularly ordered\nabstention.” Harris Cnty. Comm’rs. Court v. Moore, 420 U.S. 77, 83 (1975)\n\n                                        23\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311     Page: 24   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\n(collecting cases).   Further, “when the state-law questions have concerned\nmatters peculiarly within the province of the local courts, [the Court has]\ninclined toward abstention.” Id. at 83-84 (citations omitted). In this regard,\n      [a]mong the cases that call most insistently for abstention are those\n      in which the federal constitutional challenge turns on a state\n      statute, the meaning of which is unclear under state law. If the\n      state courts would be likely to construe the statute in a fashion that\n      would avoid the need for a federal constitutional ruling . . . , the\n      argument for abstention is strong.\nId. at 84. Thus, when there is a “substantial uncertainty as to the meaning of\nstate law” and “a reasonable possibility that the state court’s clarification of\nstate law might obviate the need for a federal constitutional ruling,” the district\ncourt must abstain from adjudicating the federal constitutional claim. Erwin\nChemerinsky, FEDERAL JURISDICTION § 12.2, at 818 (6th ed. 2012).               This\nproposition is mirrored in our precedent, under which, if a decision on the state\nlaw issue would make adjudication of the federal constitutional challenge\nunnecessary, the district court must abstain. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nUnauthorized Practice of Law Comm., 283 F.3d 650, 653 (5th Cir. 2002). As\ndescribed in more detail below, Pullman abstention is clearly and immediately\nwarranted in this case. Indeed, the majority agrees that Pullman abstention is\ncalled for but treats it as an optional, malleable doctrine that it may delay and\nmerge with its determination of whether the appeal is likely to succeed under\nthe Nken four-factor test. This is grievous, compounded error. Because of the\nnature of the Pullman doctrine, it applies only to decide when federal courts\nshould abstain or refrain from further adjudication of a claim because its\nresolution may be mooted by a state-court decision and not, as the majority\nmisuses it, to predict whether a defense on the merits will be successful on\nappeal under Nken.       Pullman abstention is designed to stop potentially\n\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\f    Case: 12-31218         Document: 00512111311        Page: 25   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 12-31218\n\nunnecessary federal litigation in its tracks and therefore should have nothing to\ndo with perpetuating federal litigation on appeal.\n                                              1.\n      In the case before us, the criteria warranting Pullman abstention plainly\nhave been met. First, a state trial court in Baton Rouge has declared Act 2\ninvalid under the Louisiana State Constitution as an unauthorized reassignment\nof students and diversion of MFP funds away from public schools and into non-\npublic schools,1 and that decision is now pending on direct appeal to the\nLouisiana Supreme Court.2 The State Officials, as well as the majority, agree\nthat if the state supreme court affirms the trial court’s decision, this federal\nlitigation will be moot, because in the absence of the 2012 state law there will be\nno diversion of public funds for private tuition or reassignment of students to\nnon-public schools. Given that the parties challenging Act 2’s constitutionality\nprevailed in the state trial court, there is sufficient uncertainty as to the\nmeaning of state law (namely, whether Act 2 comports with the commands of the\nLouisiana State Constitution). Especially noteworthy in this regard is that the\nstate court ruled Act 2 unconstitutional on the basis of a unique provision of the\nLouisiana State Constitution—one without analog in the U.S. Constitution\n—providing that funds dedicated jointly by the legislature and the BESE under\nthe MFP formula for Louisiana’s public-schools systems must be directed to\npublic parish and city school boards that administer those systems and may not\nbe diverted unilaterally by the legislature to non-public schools. See La. Fed’n\nof Teachers v. Louisiana, No. 612,733, Slip Op. at 22-34 (19th Dist. Nov. 30,\n2012); see also LA. CONST. art. VIII, § 13(B)-(C). As stated in a noted treatise,\n\n\n      1\n        See Lauren McGaughy, Jindal Voucher Overhaul Unconstitutionally Diverts Public\nFunds to Private Schools, Judge Rules, THE TIMES-PICAYUNE, Nov. 30, 2012,\nhttp://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/11/jindal_voucher_overhaul_uncons.html.\n      2\n          See LA. CONST. art. 5, § 5(D)(1).\n\n                                              25\n\f    Case: 12-31218        Document: 00512111311          Page: 26     Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-31218\n\n“abstention is justified if there is a unique state constitutional provision and a\nstate court interpretation of it could make a federal constitutional decision\nunnecessary.” Chemerinsky, supra, § 12.2, at 822; see also Reetz v. Bozanich,\n397 U.S. 82 (1970) (abstention appropriate due to unclear meaning of unique\nfishing-rights provision of state constitution).\n       Second, adjudication of the pending state-court challenge to the\nconstitutionality of Act 2 could render moot the need to address the petitioners’\nfederal constitutional challenge involving Act 2, which is predicated on the\ndistrict court’s desegregation order under Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), and United States v. Jefferson County, 380 F.2d 385 (1967) (en banc),\nand the parties so agreed at the November 26, 2012 hearing.3 This is because\nif the state court rules Act 2 unconstitutional on the basis of the Louisiana State\nConstitution, the petitioners’ claimed threatened harm—the State Officials’\ndefunding of the Tangipahoa Parish school system, their authorizing\nreassignment of parish students to non-public schools, and their payment of such\nschools’ tuition with MFP money pursuant to Act 2, and the resulting\nimpediment to the school district’s ability, for lack of funds, to comply with the\ndistrict court’s desegregation order—will vanish, thus obviating the need to rule\non the petitioners’ federal constitutional challenge. For these reasons, I believe\nthat Pullman abstention should be applied here; accordingly, the district court’s\njudgment should be immediately reversed and the case remanded with\ninstruction for the district court to abstain under Pullman. See Harris Cnty.,\n420 U.S. at 89 n.14 (“Ordinarily the proper course in ordering ‘Pullman\n\n\n\n       3\n        That the desegregation order was entered in a desegregation case premised on Brown\nand its progeny demonstrates the constitutional dimensions of the ruling requested by the\npetitioners. See Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491 (1992) (describing “those provisions of the\nlaw and the Constitution” as “predicate for judicial intervention” by way of a consent decree)\n(emphasis added).\n\n                                              26\n\f    Case: 12-31218         Document: 00512111311           Page: 27     Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 12-31218\n\nabstention’ is to remand with instructions to retain jurisdiction but to stay the\nfederal suit pending determination of the state-law questions in state court.”).4\n                                                2.\n       Although the majority concedes that the criteria for Pullman abstention\nhave been met, it wrongly refuses to apply it immediately and continues this\nlitigation by misusing the doctrine to assist in granting the State Officials a stay\nof the district court’s judgment pending appeal. This is double error because\nPullman abstention should be ordered immediately when it appears that federal\nlitigation may be an unnecessary entanglement and interference with state law;\nand the Pullman abstention criteria do not relate to the merits of the district\ncourt’s injunction. Rather, Pullman is an independent doctrine, predicated on\nfederalism, the avoidance of unnecessary federal constitutional rulings through\nabstention, and the value of allowing state courts to resolve sensitive and unique\nstate issues first, before proceeding with federal litigation. On this basis,\nPullman requires analysis independent from that conducted under Nken to\ndecide whether to stay the district court judgment while the federal litigation\ncontinues on appeal.\n       Second, despite acknowledging that Pullman should apply, the majority\nerroneously concludes that the appeal may continue and that the State Officials’\nmotion for a stay pending appeal should be granted. See Slip Op. at 16. The\nSupreme Court has instructed that when Pullman abstention is called for, the\nproper course is to remand with instruction to retain jurisdiction but stay the\nfederal suit pending determination of the state-law question in state court. See\nHarris Cnty., 420 U.S. at 89 n.14; Morales, 986 F.2d at 968-70 (reversing and\nremanding for further proceedings consistent with the court’s instruction to\n\n\n       4\n         The exception to the rule, not at issue here, is where the state “has ruled[] . . . that\nit cannot grant declaratory relief under state law if a federal court retains jurisdiction over the\nfederal claim.” Id.\n\n                                                27\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 28    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nabstain under Pullman). Once it is determined that the Pullman doctrine is\napplicable, we lack any discretion to proceed otherwise.\n      Third, in connection with Pullman abstention we should certify the\nquestion regarding Act 2’s constitutionality under the Louisiana State\nConstitution to the Louisiana Supreme Court. Certification is appropriate\nbecause, even though the issue has already been appealed to the state high court\nour certification of it may expedite resolution of this potentially dispositive\nquestion and will serve the goals of abstention and avoidance by obviating the\nneed to rule on the petitioners’ federal constitutional challenge. As the Court\nwrote in Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, “Pullman abstention [has]\nproved protracted and expensive in practice, for it entail[s] a full round of\nlitigation in the state court system before any resumption of proceedings in\nfederal court.” 520 U.S. 43, 76 (1997); see also Chemerinsky, supra, § 12.3, at\n840 (noting that the procedure, followed under Pullman and requiring parties\nto litigate state-law claims in state court first, “commonly takes many years and\nimposed substantially increased costs on litigants”). “Certification procedure,\nin contrast, allows a federal court faced with a novel state-law question to put\nthe question directly to the State’s highest court, reducing the delay, cutting the\ncost, and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response.”\nArizonans, 520 U.S. at 76; see also Lehman Bros. v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386, 391\n(1974) (noting that certification saves “time, energy, and resources and helps\nbuild a cooperative judicial federalism”); Chemerinsky, supra, § 12.3, at 841\n(“Certification greatly simplifies the abstention procedure and therefore reduces\nthe delays and increased costs usually accompanying abstention.”). Certification\nwill expedite resolution of this case while serving important goals of our nation’s\nfederalism. And in particular, time is of the essence when educating children.\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f   Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311     Page: 29   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-31218\n\n         B. The State Officials Are Not Entitled to Sovereign\n      Immunity from Suit in Federal Court To Enjoin Them from\n     Thwarting and Interfering with a Valid Desegregation Order\n      Contrary to the majority’s decision, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar\nthe district court’s enforcement of the federal consent decree and desegregation\norder by enjoining the State Officials from frustrating, interfering with, or\nthreatening to dismantle those federal orders by executing a state law that\nsharply conflicts with the federal decrees by authorizing, inter alia,\nreassignment of public school students to non-public schools and the increasing\ndiversion of state MFP funds away from the parish’s public-school system to pay\nfor transfer students’ non-public school tuition.\n      As the Supreme Court held in Frew v. Hawkins, a case such as this\n“involves the intersection of two areas of federal law: the reach of the Eleventh\nAmendment and the rules governing consent decrees.” 540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004).\nAs the Supreme Court explained:\n      The Eleventh Amendment confirms the sovereign status of the\n      States by shielding them from suits by individuals absent their\n      consent. To ensure the enforcement of federal law, however, the\n      Eleventh Amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief\n      against state officials acting in violation of federal law. This\n      standard allows courts to order prospective relief as well as\n      measures ancillary to appropriate prospective relief. Federal courts\n      may not award retrospective relief, for instance, money damages or\n      its equivalent, if the State invokes its immunity.\nId. (citations omitted).   This case is not a suit for money damages or its\nequivalent against the State, but rather a suit for an injunction requiring the\nState Officials to conform their conduct to federal constitutional law as\ninterpreted by Brown and its progeny and as set forth in the desegregation\nconsent decree entered in this case in 1965 and updated by succeeding\ndesegregation orders, the most recent being the 2012 desegregation order.\n\n\n\n\n                                       29\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 30   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\n       “Consent decrees have elements of both contracts and judicial decrees.”\nId. Thus, “[a] consent decree ‘embodies an agreement of the parties’ and is also\n‘an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be\nenforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable\nto other judgments and decrees.’” Id. And “[c]onsent decrees entered in federal\ncourt must be directed to protecting federal interests.” Id. In Firefighters v.\nCleveland, the Court “observed that a federal consent decree must spring from,\nand serve to resolve, a dispute within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction;\nmust come within the general scope of the case made by the pleadings; and must\nfurther the objectives of the law upon which the complaint was based.” Id.\n(citing 478 U.S. 501, 525 (1986)).\n      Here, the State Officials do not contend that the terms of the consent\ndecree or desegregation order were impermissible under Brown and Jefferson\nCounty. Nor do they contend that the consent decree failed to comply with\nFirefighters. Rather, the officials challenge only the district court’s means of\nenforcement of the decree and order, not their validity or entry.\n      The state officials rely heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision in\nPennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), and the\nEleventh Circuit’s decision in DeKalb County School District v. Schrenko, 109\nF.3d 680 (11th Cir. 1997). Pennhurst and DeKalb County, which relies primarily\non Pennhurst, however, are distinguishable. In those cases, the courts found the\nrationale of Ex parte Young inapplicable to suits brought against state officials\nalleging violations of state-law. 465 U.S. at 106; 109 F.3d at 688. Jurisdiction\nwas thus improper because “[a] federal court’s grant of relief against state\nofficials on the basis of state-law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not\nvindicate the supreme authority of federal law.” Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106.\nHere, by contrast, the law to be enforced is not state law but federal law,\nembodied in a federal consent decree and desegregation order that was entered\n\n                                       30\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 31   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\nto implement the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as interpreted\nby Brown and its progeny. This is the federal law which the State Officials have\nbeen enjoined from frustrating or threatening to dismantle.\n      Therefore, this case is governed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Ex\nparte Young and its progeny in which the Court has striven to harmonize the\nprinciples of state sovereign immunity with the effective supremacy of rights and\npowers secured elsewhere in the Constitution. When a suit is brought only\nagainst state officials, as in the present case, a question arises as to whether that\nsuit is a suit against the State itself. Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101. “Although\nprior decisions of [the Supreme] Court have not been entirely consistent on this\nissue, certain principles are well established.” Id. For instance, the Eleventh\nAmendment bars a suit against state officials when “the state is the real,\nsubstantial party in interest.” Ford Motor Co. v. Dep’t of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459,\n464 (1945). “The general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign if ‘the\njudgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or\ninterfere with the public administration,’ or if the effect of the judgment would\nbe ‘to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.’” Dugan v.\nRank, 372 U.S. 609, 620 (1963) (citations omitted). However,\n       [t]he Court has recognized an important exception to this general\n       rule: a suit challenging the constitutionality of a state official's\n       action is not one against the State. This was the holding in Ex parte\n       Young, . . . in which a federal court enjoined the Attorney General\n       of the State of Minnesota from bringing suit to enforce a state\n       statute that allegedly violated the Fourteenth Amendment. This\n       Court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not prohibit issuance\n       of this injunction.      The theory of the case was that an\n       unconstitutional enactment is “void” and therefore does not “impart\n       to [the officer] any immunity from responsibility to the supreme\n       authority of the United States.” Since the State could not authorize\n       the action, the officer was “stripped of his official or representative\n       character and [was] subjected to the consequences of his official\n       conduct.\n\n\n                                         31\n\f    Case: 12-31218        Document: 00512111311     Page: 32   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-31218\n\nPennhurst, 465 U.S. at 102 (citation omitted). Further,\n          [w]hile the rule permitting suits alleging conduct contrary to “the\n          supreme authority of the United States” has survived, the theory of\n          Young has not been provided an expansive interpretation. Thus, in\n          Edelman v. Jordan, . . . the Court emphasized that the Eleventh\n          Amendment bars some forms of injunctive relief against state\n          officials for violation of federal law. In particular, Edelman held\n          that when a plaintiff sues a state official alleging a violation of\n          federal law, the federal court may award an injunction that governs\n          the official's future conduct, but not one that awards retroactive\n          monetary relief. Under the theory of Young, such a suit would not\n          be one against the State since the federal-law allegation would strip\n          the state officer of his official authority.\nId. at 102-03. Thus, prospective injunctive relief against a state officer does not\namount to retroactive relief that would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\nSee id.\n\n      Applying the foregoing principles, it is clear that the district court’s\ninjunction of the State Officials’ future unconstitutional conduct that would\ncontravene federal law by frustrating and threatening defeat of the federal\nconsent decree and desegregation order, based on federal constitutional law, is\nnot a suit or an injunction against the state. Nor does the district court’s\ninjunction violate the Eleventh Amendment by granting retroactive relief against\nthe state or any state official or by ordering the payment of any compensation for\npast wrongs by the state or its officers.\n\n      The majority does not disagree with the principles enunciated by the\nSupreme Court in Ex parte Young and its progeny as set forth above. Instead,\nthe majority totally mischaracterizes the district court’s injunction by incorrectly\nstating that it is “an award of monetary relief against the State’s treasury,” Slip\nOp. at 8; that it requires the State “to answer what is essentially a claim for\ncontribution from one of its subdivisions in federal court,” Slip Op. at 9; and that\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 33   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\n“this matter does not involve a party seeking a state official’s compliance with\nfederal law that will indirectly cost the state more money,” Slip Op. at 8.\n\n      A fair and accurate reading of the record demonstrates that the district\ncourt’s injunction merely requires the State Officials to conform their prospective\nconduct to federal law as stated in the desegregation consent decree and orders;\nand that it does not order the state to contribute anything from its treasury or,\nfor that matter, to do anything at all. Indeed, because the state has not been\nmade a party, the injunction applies only against the State Officials and orders\nthat their “implementation of [Act 2] of the 2012 Regular Session of the Louisiana\nLegislature be enjoined in accordance with this Court’s previous order,” in which\nthe district court stated that its injunction would apply to restrain them\nprospectively from frustrating the court’s implementation of the desegregation\nconsent decree and orders.\n\n      The majority’s implicit argument that Superintendent White may not be\nenjoined under Ex parte Young because there is no claim that he has violated\nfederal law or acted outside of his official capacity is without merit. The\nLouisiana State Constitution places general duties on him and the members of\nthe BESE to administer Act 2 of the Regular Session of the 2012 Legislature. See\nLA. CONST. art. 8, §§ 2, 13. Act 2 itself more specifically places a duty on them to\ntake actions that would violate federal law by frustrating the district court’s\nimplementation of its desegregation consent decree and orders. Under Ex parte\nYoung, in making an officer of the state a defendant in a suit to enjoin the\nunconstitutional enforcement of a state law, the officer must have some\nconnection with the enforcement of the act. “The fact that the state officer, by\nvirtue of his office, has some connection with the enforcement of the act, is the\nimportant and material fact, and whether it arises out of the general law, or is\nspecially created by the act itself, is not material so long as it exists.” Ex parte\n\n\n                                        33\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 34   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-31218\n\nYoung, 209 U.S. at 157; see also K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 124 (5th Cir. 2010)\n(citing this passage from Young).\n\n      Finally, the cases the majority cites in support of its assertion that this is\na suit against the state in violation of the Eleventh Amendment are inapposite\nbecause they are cases in which a suit essentially sought retroactive relief, or\nmonetary compensation, against the state itself, and not prospective injunctive\nrelief against a state official. As the Supreme Court has stated:\n\n       [The Young] doctrine has existed alongside our sovereign-immunity\n       jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted as necessary to\n       “permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.” It rests on\n       the premise—less delicately called a “fiction[]”—that when a federal\n       court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain from\n       violating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign-immunity\n       purposes.\nVa. Office for Protection & Advocacy v. Stewart, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 1638 (2011). In\nthe present case, that is all the district court has done, viz., command the State\nOfficials to refrain from violating federal law embodied in the desegregation\nconsent decree and orders. Accordingly, the district court had jurisdiction to\nissue the injunction, and the Eleventh Amendment presented no bar.\n         C. The State Officials Have Failed To Make a Strong\n      Showing of a Likelihood of Success on the Merits Regarding\n         the District Court’s Application of the All Writs Act\n      The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), empowers “a federal court to issue\nsuch commands . . . as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent\nthe frustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction.\notherwise obtained.” United States v. N.Y. Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172 (1977).\nUnder the Act, a district court may issue a writ binding persons or entities that\nwere not parties to the underlying litigation if their conduct frustrates the court’s\norder. See id. at 174. As the Supreme Court has stated, “three conditions must\nbe satisfied before [the writ] may issue”:\n\n\n                                         34\n\f    Case: 12-31218      Document: 00512111311        Page: 35     Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-31218\n\n       First, “the party seeking issuance of the writ [must] have no other\n       adequate means to attain the relief he desires,” a condition designed\n       to ensure that the writ will not be used as a substitute for the\n       regular appeals process. Second, the petitioner must satisfy “the\n       burden of showing that [his] right to issuance of the writ is clear and\n       indisputable.” Third, even if the first two prerequisites have been\n       met, the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be\n       satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\nCheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380-81 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted). Although the majority asserts that the\ndistrict court lacked authority under the Act, this is incorrect.\n      Given the framework advanced by the majority, the State Officials bear the\nburden of demonstrating a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits\nthat one or more of the conditions outlined in Cheney is missing. See Slip Op. at\n4-5, 11-15; see also Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. The State Officials have not met this\nburden. Instead, their only argument regarding the All Writs Act is that the Act\n“cannot serve as an independent basis for jurisdiction.” See Texas v. Real Parties\nin Interest, 259 F.3d 387, 392 (5th Cir. 2001).5 However, no one disputes that the\ndistrict court already possessed an independent basis for the exercise of\njurisdiction: namely, the decades-old desegregation suit out of which the 2010\nconsent decree arose and is still under the district court’s supervision. Thus, the\nState Officials’ argument misses the mark and, moreover, does not constitute a\nstrong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits as required by Nken.\n      Given the State Officials’ terse All Writs Act analysis, the majority has\nseen fit to supply the State Officials’ argument for them. Not only is this\ninappropriate under Nken, but the majority’s arguments are also incorrect. First,\nthe majority asserts that the petitioners possess adequate means of relief apart\n\n\n       5\n         The State Officials also assert that the Act may not be “used to circumvent or\nsupersede the constitutional limitations of the Eleventh Amendment.” See In re Baldwin-\nUnited Corp., 770 F.2d 328, 340 (2d Cir. 1985). Given that the Eleventh Amendment does not\nbar the present suit, this observation is beside the point.\n\n                                           35\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 36   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\nfrom the All Writs Act. Slip Op. at 12. The meager options the majority suggests\nare twofold: (1) entreat the State Legislature to either provide greater funding or\nrepeal Act 2; or (2) rely on the pending state-court proceeding addressing the\nconstitutionality of Act 2 under the Louisiana State Constitution.          See id.\nHowever, and as the district court observed in its November 30 order, the\npending state-court proceeding does not address compliance with the 2010\nconsent decree nor how Act 2 will affect Tangipahoa’s ability to achieve unitary\nstatus; that issue would be beyond the scope of that proceeding. Although\nresolution of the pending state-court suit may moot the need for further federal\nlitigation, this factor is addressed to Pullman abstention, see supra, not the first\nfactor for invocation of the All Writs Act, which asks whether recourse to the\nstate-court litigation will enable the petitioners to assert their claim that the\nState Officials’ administration of Act 2 frustrates and defeats the school board’s\ncompliance with the 2010 consent decree. Moreover, given that the state trial\ncourt declined to enjoin the voucher program, timely access to relief is not\navailable to petitioners. See Stephanie Simon, Louisiana Voucher Program Ruled\nUnconstitutional,         The     Huffington       Post,     Nov.    30,    2012,\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/30/judge-rules-louisiana-sch_n_222096\n2.html. Regarding whether the petitioners should be required to lobby the\nlegislature, relief from that body not only is speculative but also ignores that,\nabsent the injunctive relief requested, the petitioners’ ability to comply with the\nconsent decree will be undermined and severely frustrated.\n      Second, the majority contends that the petitioners have not shown that\ntheir right to the writ is “clear and indisputable” because they allegedly rely on\nspeculation and general financial information to show the harm that Act 2\ncreates. See Slip Op. at 12. The district court noted that the applicability of the\nAll Writs Act in this very context (namely, allowing a federal court to enforce its\nconsent decrees) is well established.        Moreover, the majority’s argument\n\n                                        36\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 37   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\nimpermissibly shifts the burden from the State Officials requesting a stay to the\npetitioners who have successfully convinced the district court that application of\nthe All Writs Act is warranted. The district court is in a better position, having\nsupervised the underlying desegregation suit for decades and overseen countless\nhours of careful negotiations between the parties, to judge what will and will not\naffect Tangipahoa’s compliance with the consent decree. See Tasby v. Black Coal.\nTo Maximize Educ., 771 F.2d 849, 855 (5th Cir. 1985) (reasoning that “great\ndeference is given to the district courts” in reviewing desegregation orders\nbecause “the district courts are best situated to understand the particular\nproblems and needs of the districts in which they sit” and “their proximity to local\nconditions” enables them to “best perform this judicial appraisal”) (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (citing Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 299 (1955)\n(Brown II)); cf. Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 281 (1990) (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting) (referring to the district court’s “intimate contact” with and “special\ninsight” into the facts of the case and criticizing the Court for its “ex post\nrationalization” from its “detached vantage point” for disturbing the district\ncourt’s calculated judgment of what would “most likely . . . work quickly and least\ndisruptively” in the case); see also Newby v. Enron Corp., 338 F.3d 467, 476 (5th\nCir. 2003) (reviewing issuance of a writ pursuant to the All Writs Act for abuse\nof discretion).   The majority’s analysis, then, robs the district court of the\ndeference we are required to pay to the court’s determination that Act 2 is a\nthreat to compliance with the federal constitutionally required consent decree\nand unitary system conversion plan. See Tasby, 771 F.2d at 855 .\n      Third, the majority reasons that issuance of the writ was not appropriate\nunder the circumstances because only one-quarter of one percent of\nschoolchildren in the parish are affected, at this point in time in the first year of\nthe voucher program. Again, this pays little fealty to the considered wisdom and\ncommon sense of the district court’s judgment and, moreover, ignores the\n\n                                         37\n\f    Case: 12-31218      Document: 00512111311        Page: 38   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-31218\n\ndetermination that the number of schoolchildren participating in the voucher\nprogram, thereby abandoning the public schools in Tangipahoa and depriving\nthem of much-needed funding, undoubtedly will increase in future. For the\nforegoing reasons, I do not believe the State Officials have satisfied their burden\nof making a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits regarding the\ndistrict court’s utilization of the All Writs Act.\n           D. The State Officials Have Failed To Satisfy Their\n           Burden of Demonstrating All Four Nken Factors To\n                     Justify a Stay Pending Appeal\n      The State Officials bear the burden of satisfying all four Nken factors in\norder to warrant a stay pending appeal. See 556 U.S. at 434. Despite this, the\nState Officials have satisfied none.\n      First, the State Officials have failed to make a strong showing of a\nlikelihood of success on the merits. Even assuming that analysis under the\nEleventh Amendment and Pullman doctrine is appropriately subsumed under\nNken’s first factor—a contention with which I take great issue given the\njurisdiction-sapping nature of affirmative answers under either doctrine—the\nState Officials’ arguments based on the Eleventh Amendment, Pullman, and the\nAll Writs Act fail to demonstrate a strong showing of a likelihood of success on\nthe merits. Thus, the State Officials must make a strong showing in some other\nfashion.\n      In this regard, the State Officials bear the burden of strongly showing that\nthe district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction to\nhalt Act 2’s interference with the consent decree in Tangipahoa. See Planned\nParenthood Ass’n of Hidalgo Cnty. Tex., Inc. v. Suehs, 692 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.\n2012). This is a high bar, one that calls for greater deference to the findings and\nconclusions of the district court than if we as a panel were to conduct a de\nnovo review of the issues presented in this appeal. See id.; Tasby, 771 F.2d 849,\n855. The district court determined, based in part on the testimony, discussions,\n\n                                         38\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311        Page: 39   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-31218\n\nand evidence it considered in formulating its consent decree and unitary-school-\nsystem plan, that the operation of Act 2 in Tangipahoa would undermine or\nunduly impede the school board’s ability to comply with the consent decree and\nthe goal of achieving unitary status. Thus, the State Officials are obliged to make\na strong showing that the diversion of MFP funding away from the public-school\nsystem and into non-public schools via the use of vouchers by schoolchildren\nopting out of the former to attend the latter, would not interfere with or\nundermine the district court’s carefully crafted consent decree and unitary school\nsystem plan, which was based on projections measuring public-school enrollment\nand the corresponding allocation of MFP funds to Tangipahoa by the State. I\nparticularly note that the State Officials introduced no evidence to show that Act\n2’s unilateral diversion of MFP funds and enrollment from public schools to non-\npublic schools would not interfere with and undermine the district court’s consent\ndecree and unitary public school system plan for Tangipahoa public schools.\nThey did not show—nor, I question, could they—that the diversion of MFP\nfunding from Tangipahoa would not affect the meticulous requirements imposed\non the school system, including the construction of new facilities, the\nimprovement of old ones, new teacher-training requirements, school programs,\nand student assignments.          Instead, the State Officials simply argued that\nTangipahoa received slightly more MFP funds for the 2012-2013 school year than\nit received for the 2011-2012 school year. This argument did not take into\naccount the added burdens imposed upon the Tangipahoa public system by the\ndistrict court’s consent decree and unitary plan in the next and succeeding years.\nBecause of a lack of evidence and failure to acknowledge that growth in profits\nwithout accounting for added debt does not guarantee financial health, the State\nOfficials have failed to satisfy their burden of making a strong showing of\nlikelihood of success in reversing the district court’s findings and judgment with\nrespect to Nken’s first factor.\n\n                                          39\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 40   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\n      Second, the State Officials have failed to make out an irreparable injury as\nrequired by Nken’s second factor. Our temporary stay of the injunction on\nDecember 14, 2012 permitted the payment of the fifty children’s vouchers on\nDecember 17, 2012 and the continued implementation of Act 2 in Tangipahoa.\nThis undercuts the majority’s contention that the fifty participating\nschoolchildren would have to relocate absent timely payments during the school\nyear. See Slip Op. at 15. Further, even under the injunction’s terms, the loss of\nvouchers by the fifty schoolchildren currently enrolled in the voucher program in\nTangipahoa neither substantially nor irreparably would have injured the voucher\nprogram or the affected children. The schoolchildren would have remained\nentitled to free public education by the Tangipahoa school district and Act 2\nwould have been temporarily stopped only as to fifty students in one public-school\ndistrict out of sixty-nine statewide. Therefore, even if we had not issued our\ntemporary stay of the injunction, no irreparable injury would have befallen the\nstate or the fifty children due to the district court’s judgment.\n      Regarding the third and fourth Nken factors—whether the stay will\nsubstantially harm the petitioners and a determination of where the public\ninterest lies—the State Officials have also failed to satisfy Nken’s commands. In\nparticular, the State Officials rely solely on their assertion that the school board\nin fact received more funding this year than it did last year. But, as mentioned\npreviously, the State Officials’ argument fails to take into account the burdens\nthe school system will be obligated to discharge in the future; essentially, the\nState Officials are reading only one side of Tangipahoa’s profit-and-loss\nstatement. Showing that neither the public interest in public education nor the\nTangipahoa public school system, within the context of the consent decree and\nunitary plan, will be harmed by the Act 2 voucher program requires a much more\ncomplex analysis. The additional burdens on the Tangipahoa public school\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 41   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-31218\n\nsystem by the consent decree and unitary school system plan, as well as other\nfactors such as demographics and inflation, would have to be taken into account.\n      The majority’s attempt to minimize the harm that will befall petitioners if\nthey are unable to comply with consent decree, as well as their assertion that\nNken’s last two factors are “less significant” ignores that State Officials’ burden\nin satisfying all four factors. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434; Slip Op. at 15-16.\nAdditionally, the district court observed that the expansion of non-public schools\nin and around the parish concomitant with the enactment of Act 2, as well as the\nlikely increase in the number of students availing themselves of vouchers, would\nfurther destabilize the carefully crafted consent decree. Doc. No. 1066, at 12-13.\nUnder the third Nken factor, it is up to the State Officials to demonstrate that the\npetitioners will not be substantially harmed. See id. It is not the role of the\nmajority, conceding that Act 2 interferes with the school board’s ability to comply\nwith the consent decree, see Slip Op. at 16, to assert that Act 2 does not interfere\nwith Tangipahoa’s compliance enough. All this leads to the conclusion that the\nState Officials have failed to carry their burden with respect to Nken’s third and\nfourth factors. Based on this and foregoing, the State Officials have failed to\ncarry their burden and thus demonstrate that a stay is warranted based on an\napplication of the Nken factors.\n                                   CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s refusal\nto grant the State Officials’ request to order Pullman abstention in this case by\nreversing the district court’s judgment and remanding the case to it for federal-\ncourt abstention; from the majority’s improper use of the doctrines of sovereign\nimmunity and Pullman abstention in its Nken analysis; from its determination\nthat sovereign immunity bars the district court’s injunction issued to restrain the\nState Officials from doing nothing more than violating federal law embodied in\nthe district court’s desegregation consent decree and orders; and from its\n\n                                        41\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 42   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nerroneous determination that the State Officials satisfied their burden with\nrespect to all four factors under Nken.\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f",

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311     Page: 2   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\n      In a longstanding pending desegregation case, the district court enjoined\ncertain non-party state actors (Appellants here) from implementing a recently\npassed statute with respect to the defendant parish school board.            The\nAppellants filed an emergency motion seeking to stay a portion of a preliminary\ninjunction pending appeal. On December 14, 2012, we granted a temporary stay\npending further order of this court. We note that this matter comes before us as\na motions panel only on the question of whether a stay pending appeal should\nbe granted. The motion was filed as an emergency motion, with limited time for\nbriefing and consideration. Under the posture of the case as presented to us, we\nare addressing only the question of whether the district court’s injunction order\nshould be stayed pending consideration of all arguments raised by the parties\n– jurisdictional and otherwise – following full briefing and, if appropriate, oral\nargument. In assessing whether to grant a stay, we necessarily must examine\nthe merits of the parties’ arguments. But, given the procedural posture of this\ncase, we emphasize that we do not intend to bind the ultimate merits panel\nwhich will consider the matter following full appellate process. Additionally, we\ndetermine that a full exposition of the law in this area is unnecessary and\ninappropriate at this stage, so we will endeavor to be brief in our reasoning. For\nthe reasons stated below, we now GRANT the Appellants’ motion and STAY the\ndistrict court’s order pending appeal.\n     I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n      The desegregation plaintiffs and the Tangipahoa Parish School Board (“the\nBoard”) (collectively, “the Petitioners”) filed motions for the issuance of writs\npursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), seeking injunctions against\nthe further implementation of certain provisions of Acts 1 and 2 of the 2012\nRegular Session of the Louisiana Legislature (“Act 1” and “Act 2”) based on their\nalleged interference with a court-ordered consent decree.        The underlying\nconsent decree arose from a 1965 federal desegregation suit, Moore v.\n\n                                         2\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 3   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nTangipahoa Parish School Board, in which the district court issued an order\nestablishing certain student assignment and facilities requirements aimed at\nassisting the Board in achieving unitary school system status.\n      The most relevant portion of the newly enacted law is the Student\nScholarships for Educational Excellence Act, LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§\n17:4011–:4025, implemented through Act 2. This Act creates a school-voucher\nor scholarship program (“the Program”) that allows students in Tangipahoa\nParish (“the Parish”) to attend alternative public or private educational\ninstitutions in lieu of attending their assigned underperforming public school in\nthe Parish. See LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 17:4013, :4018. When students elect to\nparticipate in the Program, Minimum Foundation Program (“MFP”) funds,\nwhich are state funds intended for public education, are diverted from the\nstudent’s assigned public school in the Parish to the alternative public or private\ninstitution where the student is educated. See id. § 17:4016. At present, fifty of\nthe approximately 20,000 students in the Parish are participating in the\nProgram. The Petitioners allege that compliance with the court-ordered consent\ndecree requires them to receive full MFP funding and that the Program’s\ndiversion of MFP funds frustrates their ability to implement the provisions of\nthe decree.\n      On October 22, 2012, the district court ordered John White, Louisiana\nSuperintendent of Education (“Superintendent White”), the Louisiana\nDepartment of Education (“the Department”), and the Louisiana Board of\nElementary and Secondary Education (“BESE”) (collectively, “the State”), “to\nshow cause . . . as to why a preliminary injunction should not be entered . . .\nenjoining and prohibiting . . . further implementation of [the Program in the\nParish].” The district court also ordered the State to show “why a mandatory\npreliminary injunction should not be entered . . . directing [the State] to\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 12-31218       Document: 00512111311         Page: 4     Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-31218\n\nimmediately commence full MFP funding to the [Board] for each student on a\nscholarship pursuant to the [Program].”\n       The State responded and during the November 26, 2012, hearing the\ndistrict court issued a preliminary injunction.1 As instructed by the court, the\nPetitioners and the State submitted proposed orders consistent with the court’s\noral reasons. On November 28, 2012, the district court entered the Petitioners’\nproposed order thereby enjoining the Program in the Parish.\n       The next day, the court denied the State’s request for a stay of the\npreliminary injunction pending appeal. The State timely moved this court to\nstay a portion of the preliminary injunction. See FED. R. APP. P. 8(a)(1)(C).\n       At the same time that the federal district court injunction process was\nongoing, a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Program was pending\nin a Louisiana state trial court. That case examines the validity of the Program\nunder the Louisiana state constitution. See La. Fed’n of Teachers v. Louisiana,\nNo. 612,733, slip op. at 2 (19th La. Dist. Nov. 30, 2012). The state trial court\nfound that the Program violates the state constitution by diverting public funds\nfrom the state’s public schools to private entities. See id. This ruling may be\ndirectly appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court and, as discussed below, could\nrender this federal action moot.\n                            II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       We review a district court’s denial of a stay pending appeal for abuse of\ndiscretion. See Wildmon v. Berwick Universal Pictures, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597523\"><a href=\"/opinion/597523/donald-e-wildmon-and-american-family-association-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (5th Cir.\n1992); see also Beverly v.

REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 17:4011–:4025, the Course Choice Program, LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§\n17:4002.1–:4002.6, and certain provisions of Act 1, which focus on teacher tenure and\naccountability. Because the State requests a stay of the injunction only as it pertains to the\nProgram administered pursuant to the Student Scholarships for Educational Excellence Act,\nwe do not consider whether the injunction should be stayed as to these other provisions.\n\n                                              4\n\f     Case: 12-31218      Document: 00512111311         Page: 5    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-31218\n\n(“[T]he accepted standard for review of such a stay is whether or not the trial\ncourt abused its sound discretion in denying the stay.”).                The factors for\nevaluating the appropriateness of a stay pending appeal are well-established:\n“(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured\nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other\nparties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”\nHilton v.

As the movant for a stay pending appeal, the State\ncarries the burden to satisfy the four factors, see Ruiz v. Estelle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398038\"><a href=\"/opinion/398038/david-r-ruiz-united-states-of-america-intervenor-appellee-v-w-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n856 (5th Cir. 1982), and it is not entitled to the stay as a matter of right. See\nNken, 556 U.S. at 433.\n                                  III. DISCUSSION\n       We conclude that the State has met its burden of establishing that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying the stay of the preliminary\ninjunction.2\n       A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n       The State must make “a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the\nmerits.” Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776. In assessing this standard, “the movant need\nnot always show a ‘probability’ of success on the merits.” Ruiz v. Estelle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391038\"><a href=\"/opinion/391038/david-r-ruiz-united-states-of-america-intervenor-appellee-v-w-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 (5th Cir. 1981) (citation omitted). “[I]nstead, the [State] need only\npresent a substantial case on the merits when a serious legal question is\n\n\n       2\n        As discussed above, this appeal presents an emergency motion to stay, which is being\ndecided on an abbreviated briefing schedule and within a limited time. We apply only the\nstandard governing whether a stay of the preliminary injunction should be granted.\nAccordingly, nothing in our opinion should be read as an intent to bind the merits panel\ndetermining whether the district court appropriately issued the injunction.\n\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 6   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\ninvolved and show that the balance of the equities weighs heavily in favor of\ngranting the stay.” Id.; see also Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (noting that the movant\nmust show “[m]ore than a mere possibility of relief”).             The State has\ndemonstrated that it is likely to succeed in establishing that the district court\nimproperly issued the preliminary injunction based on several grounds\nincluding: (1) the district court’s lack of jurisdiction under the Eleventh\nAmendment; (2) the Pullman abstention doctrine; and (3) the lack of evidence\nestablishing authority for the court to act pursuant to the All Writs Act.\n      1. Lack of Jurisdiction Based on Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n      The State has a strong likelihood of prevailing on its claim that the district\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction because its\nexercise of authority violated the State’s Eleventh Amendment sovereign\nimmunity. Absent a waiver of immunity by a state or through a federal statute,\nthe Eleventh Amendment protects states from suit in federal court regardless\nof whether the suit seeks damages or injunctive relief.

The legislative debate over such allocation is uniquely an exercise of\nstate sovereignty.”). In general, then, federal courts do not interfere in a state’s\ndisputes with its own political subdivisions.\n      Here, Petitioners seek injunctive relief against two state agencies, the\nDepartment and BESE. Further, there is no claim that Superintendent White\nhas violated federal law or acted outside of his official capacity, and the State is\nnot a party to the consent decree. Accordingly, there is a significant likelihood\nthat the State can show the preliminary injunction offends Eleventh\nAmendment immunity because an injunction against the Department, BESE,\nor Superintendent White is effectively an injunction against the State.\n      The Petitioners’ statements in their briefing to the district court reveal the\ntrue nature of their complaint.       Specifically, the Board seeks to avoid “a\nreduction in MFP funding” because “[t]he school board is in need of funding now”\nand it “can ill afford to have the state reduce its share of MFP funding.” These\nstatements show that the Board does not seek an injunction to prevent violations\nof federal law, but instead seeks such relief in order to prevent the\nimplementation of the state legislature’s decisions concerning education funding,\na quintessentially state issue. They also show that the essence of the relief\nsought is not injunctive but rather monetary – enjoining the State from “failing\nto pay” is little less than telling the State to pay.\n      In addition to requiring the State to address legislative decisions about\nstate funding in federal court, the district court thus required the State to\n\n                                          7\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311          Page: 8   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nrespond to what is essentially a contribution claim by one of its own\nsubdivisions. Such disputes concerning the allocation of the state’s financial\nresources fall within the purview of a state’s sovereign power, and requiring a\nstate to answer a claim for contribution – however disguised – from one of its\nown subdivisions violates its Eleventh Amendment immunity.

See\nUnited States v. Tex. Educ.

Such\nattempts to recover funding from a state ostensibly to comply with a\ndesegregation order to which it is not a party “smacks of an attempted end-run\naround the [state] legislature’s allocation of state funds.” Id. at 1265.\n      The   district   court   justified       the   issuance   of   the   preliminary\ninjunction—which essentially serves as an award of monetary relief against the\nState’s treasury—by noting that the Supreme Court “has curbed [the limitation\nproscribing an award of money damages] in the case of a federal court giving\nprospective injunctive relief against a state officer even though compliance with\nthe injunction will cost the state money in the future.” A district court is not\nfree to interfere in state spending decisions simply because raising and lowering\nfunding levels may have some incidental impact on a federal decree. The\ninjunction here is not aimed at preventing direct interference with a court-\nordered consent decree, but instead bars state officials from implementing a\nstate’s program and funding decisions because of their attenuated connection to\na consent decree. Unlike the cases relied on by the district court, this matter\ndoes not involve a party seeking a state official’s compliance with federal law\n\n                                           8\n\f     Case: 12-31218       Document: 00512111311           Page: 9    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-31218\n\nthat will indirectly cost the state more money. See, e.g., Quern, 440 U.S. at 336,\n349 (federal court has jurisdiction to order state officials to send notification to\nclass plaintiffs of the availability of an administrative remedy to recover public\nbenefits); Edelman, 415 U.S. at 668 (finding a federal court cannot require the\n“payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance in the\nfuture with a substantive federal-question determination”). Furthermore the\ndistrict court’s reliance on Milliken v. Bradley is misplaced because, unlike here,\nthe state in Milliken was a party to the original desegregation order and was\nfound to be partially responsible for the segregation. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269, 289-90\n(1977) (finding that federal court has jurisdiction to allocate costs between state\nand local officials when ordering a school desegregation plan).\n       Put another way, the gravamen of Petitioners’ claims is an attempt to\navoid decreases in education funding. Masking it as a concern about compliance\nwith the district court’s desegregation order does not change the fundamental\nnature of the injunction as one directly affecting a state’s sovereign decision-\nmaking about state spending. This approach, then, conflicts with the State’s\nsovereign immunity by requiring it to answer what is essentially a claim for\ncontribution from one of its subdivisions in federal court. Accordingly, the State\nhas a strong likelihood of success in showing that the district court’s issuance of\nthe preliminary injunction violated the State’s Eleventh Amendment sovereign\nimmunity.3\n              2. Pullman Abstention\n\n\n       3\n           The extent of the Board’s argument concerning this issue on appeal lies in its\nassertion that the injunction does not run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment to the extent that\nit enjoins “John White in his official capacity.” The Board does not cite any authority for this\nconclusion. The fact that Superintendent White is enjoined in his official capacity does not\ncure the potential affront to Eleventh Amendment immunity in this matter.

Here, the\nPetitioners have alternative means of relief apart from reliance on a writ. In\naddition to seeking relief from the state legislature in the form of additional\nfunding or repeal of the Program, the Petitioners may avail themselves of relief\nin state court. In fact, proceedings in the state court already suggest that\nalternative relief would be available in light of a recent decision from a state\ndistrict court holding that the Program’s disbursement of education funds to\nprivate institutions violates Louisiana’s state constitution.

The State has a strong\nargument that the Petitioners have not established their “clear and\nindisputable” right to the writ.

This evidence—based merely on general financial information and\nspeculation that the Program will eventually expand to a point that causes them\nharm—fails to demonstrate immediate irreparable harm warranting relief.6 See\nHolland Am. Ins. Co. v. Succession of Roy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461238\"><a href=\"/opinion/461238/holland-america-insurance-company-v-succession-of-shepherd-j-roy-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 997 (5th Cir. 1985)\n(“Speculative injury is not sufficient; there must be more than an unfounded fear\non the part of the applicant.” (citation omitted)).

No specifics about the particular\ndecreases and the particular impact was provided to the district court.\n       Third, assuming the petition meets the first two requirements, a court\nshould exercise discretion before issuing a writ to ensure it “is appropriate under\nthe circumstances.” Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381 (citation omitted). The All Writs\nAct does not grant blanket authority to enjoin state conduct in matters related\nto a state’s funding of its subdivisions.

Kentwood High School,\nhowever, is not one of the “assigned schools” or “last attending school” for any of the fifty\nstudents participating in the Program.\n       6\n         Indeed, the little evidence presented is to the contrary. Prior to filing its Motion for\nIssuance of Writs, the Board requested a modification of the consent decree to authorize\napproximately $1.4 million of improvements to five schools, none of which are the “assigned\nschool” or the “last attending school” of the fifty students enrolled in the Program. This\nmodification of the consent decree is significant because it suggests that while the Board\nclaims it cannot sustain the loss of MFP funding associated with the Program, the Board’s\nbudget still allows it to modify the consent to decree in order to receive authorization to\nallocate additional money to schools unaffected by the Program.\n\n                                               14\n\f    Case: 12-31218        Document: 00512111311          Page: 15      Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-31218\n\ncircumstances.” Wisc.

Petitioners’ arguments during the\nNovember 26 district court hearing suggest nothing more than that the Program\nfrustrates the consent decree by interfering with their calculations based on\nprojections in school growth and student attendance. It is difficult to imagine,\nhowever, that the Program, which affects less than one quarter of one percent\nof the Parish’s students, will have a substantial enough effect on the Board’s\ncalculations to warrant the “extraordinary remedies” provided by the All Writs\nAct.\n       The Board’s rationale leads to the conclusion that whenever a state\nlegislature’s actions result in an indirect reduction in education funding a\nfederal court can enjoin the implementation of the funding decision so long as\nthe party seeking the writ merely shows that it is in need of funding or that a\nchange in funding could limit its financial resources. Such a broad use of\nauthority is not compatible with the Supreme Court’s admonition that the All\nWrits Act is an extraordinary form of relief.7\n\n\n       B. Irreparable Harm\n\n\n       7\n          The district court also purported to act pursuant to its inherent powers. The cases\nrelied upon by the district court in the exercise of this power, however, involved the\nenforcement of consent decrees against parties who agreed to be bound by the decrees. See\ne.g., Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435-36 (2004) (enforcing consent decree\nagainst state officials who were parties to the original decree); United States v.

Accordingly, even if the Board presented adequate evidence that\nthe Program conflicted with the consent decree, the All Writs Act—and not the court’s\ninherent power—would serve as the proper source of authority to protect a consent decree from\nthe actions of a non-party to the decree.\n\n                                               15\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 16   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\n      The irreparable injury to the State caused by the preliminary injunction\nweighs in favor of a stay pending appeal. See Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776. As the\nState points out, the immediate implementation of the injunction will cause\nirreparable harm to the fifty students participating in the Program because the\nfailure to make timely scholarship payments to the students’ schools would\nresult in the children having to relocate during the school year. This result\nwould frustrate the State’s program thereby causing harm to it and the students\nthat the State seeks to serve. The injunction causes further direct irreparable\nharm against the State as it deprives the State of the opportunity to implement\nits own legislature’s decisions concerning education funding and forces it to\nanswer for claims in federal court that are likely barred by Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.\n      C. Substantial Injury to Petitioners and Public Interest\n      The factors discussed above—a substantial likelihood of success on the\nmerits and the irreparable harm to the State—are the most important. Nken,\n556 U.S. at 434. The final two factors—the potential for substantial injury to the\nPetitioners and the public interest—are less significant in our analysis. We\nrecognize that the Board may face an injury if it is unable to comply with the\nconsent decree, which could affect its ability to become a unitary school system.\nThe evidence presented in the district court, however, belies the claim of injury\nto the Petitioners, at least at this point.\n      Finally, the public interest factor leans in favor of the State. Enjoining a\nState from implementing its own law while an appeal is pending before a federal\ncourt invokes significant concerns related to principles of federalism and comity.\nThese concerns are especially significant here where the State is enjoined from\nimplementing its education funding due to an appeal of a federal court action\ninvolving claims for which the State is likely entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.\n\n                                         16\n\f   Case: 12-31218   Document: 00512111311     Page: 17   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                               No. 12-31218\n\n                            IV.

A state trial\ncourt has declared the school-voucher law unconstitutional under the Louisiana\nState Constitution, that decision has been appealed directly to the Louisiana\nSupreme Court, and the state’s highest court will resolve that state\nconstitutional issue soon.    Accordingly, because the parties, and even the\nmajority, agree that a Louisiana Supreme Court affirmance of the state trial\ncourt’s judgment will moot this federal litigation entirely, I respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority’s refusal to reverse the district court’s judgment and order it\nto abide by Pullman abstention. There is no good reason for the continuation of\nthis (potentially unnecessary) federal litigation at this time. We are qualified\nand able to make a decision regarding Pullman, we unanimously agree that the\ncriteria for that abstention have been satisfied, and the rationale underlying\nthat doctrine—reducing friction between the federal and state judiciaries when\nimportant questions of state law are involved—calls strongly for the doctrine’s\ninvocation here.\n      Aside from the majority’s unfortunate decision to continue this federal\nlitigation even though it concedes that Pullman abstention should be ordered,\n\n                                        18\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 19    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nI also disagree strongly with the majority’s erroneous reasoning in granting a\nstay of the district court’s judgment pending appeal.         First, the majority\nincorrectly assumes that the doctrines of Pullman abstention and Eleventh\nAmendment sovereign immunity from federal suit may be invoked—not to\nterminate or halt this litigation—to enhance the State Officials’ likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits in the stay-pending-appeal analysis. This assumption is\nplainly wrong. Those independent doctrines may be used to end or suspend a\nfederal suit but not to enhance its likelihood of success on the merits on appeal\nfor stay purposes. Second, the majority not only abuses process by refusing to\ninvoke Pullman immediately but also incorrectly decides that the State Officials\nwill be able to invoke Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal suit before\nthe merits panel in this appeal. As the State Officials concede in their motion,\nhowever, the State of Louisiana is not a party of record or otherwise involved in\nthe underlying litigation. Rather, in this case, the district court, enforcing its\nforty-five-year-old consent decree and desegregation order against the\nTangipahoa Parish School Board, prospectively enjoined the State Officials from\nexecuting and applying a state law so as to violate the federal constitution by\nfrustrating, interfering with, and threatening to dismantle the desegregation\norder, based on the Fourteenth Amendment and Brown v. Board of Education,\nthat requires and establishes terms and conditions for the conversion of the\nparish public-school system from a racially discriminatory dual system to a\nconstitutionally unitary system. It is well settled that prospective injunctive\nrelief against state officers, as opposed to the state per se, which bars them from\nviolations of the federal constitution or laws, does not contravene state sovereign\nimmunity from federal court suits.

That same year, the District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana, in Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish School Board, adopted a\nschool-desegregation    consent   decree     finding   that   system    to   be   an\nunconstitutional racially dual system and required the school board to convert\nit to a unitary non-racially discriminatory system.

On March 4, 2010, following a\nseries of earlier modifications, the district court, pursuant to the consent decree\nand after hearings and discussions with interested parties, issued an order (Rec.\nDoc. No. 876) establishing a desegregation order, under which the Tangipahoa\nParish School Board, when it reached full compliance, would achieve unitary\nschool-system status and obviate the need for further judicial supervision. To\nthis end, the consent decree and order detailed numerous obligations with which\nthe school board must comply, including: the construction of new schools and the\nenhancement of existing facilities; the creation of new magnet programs; new\nteacher assignments, certifications, and training; reporting and monitoring\nrequirements to ensure compliance with the court’s order, and the design and\nimplementation of a parish-wide school taxing district for the issuance of debt\n\n                                        20\n\f   Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 21   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nto finance capital improvements. Furthermore, the district court’s order detailed\na student-assignment plan predicated on the ordered expenditures detailed\nabove and expressly assumed receipt of MFP funding to satisfy the obligations\nimposed. See Doc. 876.\n      Subsequently, the Louisiana Legislature enacted Acts 1 and 2 of the 2012\nRegular Session establishing a school-voucher program authorizing the\ndisbursement of public funds, diverted from Minimum Foundation Program\n(“MFP”) funding, to enable eligible schoolchildren to leave Tangipahoa Parish\npublic schools to attend private, or non-public, schools of their choice. See LA.\nREV. STAT. § 17:4016. The MFP is a fund of public money dedicated to public\nprimary and secondary school education and determined by collaboration\nbetween the legislature and the BESE. It is then distributed according to a\nformula also derived from that collaboration to each of the sixty-nine public\nschool systems in the state. Importantly, the provisions of the Louisiana State\nConstitution do not authorize the legislature to unilaterally alter the dedication\nor the distribution formula. See LA. CONST. art. VIII, § 13(B); La. Fed’n of\nTeachers v. Louisiana, No.612,733, Slip Op. at 22-34 (19th. Dist. Nov. 30, 2012).\n      MFP funding, in conjunction with the operation of Act 2, is a zero-sum\nexercise such that MFP money, intended for public-school use, diverted for use\nby non-public schools deprives public-school districts such as Tangipahoa of the\nuse of such funds. Currently, during the first year of the voucher program, fifty\nchildren in Tangipahoa Parish receive school-voucher funds and attend non-\npublic schools. However, this number will surely grow as non-public schools\nexpand and new non-public schools are opened. In particular, the district court\nobserved that thirty-two of Tangipahoa’s public schools—representing a\n“considerable” number of students in the district—currently receive “C,” “D,” or\n“F” grades, entitling students at those schools to receive a voucher enabling\nthem to attend school elsewhere. Reimbursement for such vouchers comes from\n\n                                       21\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 22   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nMFP funding the public schools would otherwise receive and, furthermore,\ncorresponds with private-school tuition, which a private school is free to increase\nshould it so desire. Doc. 1066, at 13 n.2. Thus, the district court determined\nthat Act 2 threatens to undermine the Tangipahoa Parish desegregation consent\ndecree and the unitary school system plan of conversion by interfering with the\ncourt-mandated obligations laid out in the 2010 consent decree.\n      On September 24, 2012, the desegregation plaintiffs and the Tangipahoa\nParish School Board filed a “Motion for Issuance of Writs Pursuant to the All\nWrits Act” (Doc. 1021, Exhibit “D”) to enjoin the State Officials’ implementation\nof section 17:4016 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, which provides for a local-\nshare allocation in the calculation of funding to city and parish school systems\nfor students in Tangipahoa Parish attending non-public schools under the\nschool-voucher program. The Tangipahoa Parish School Board claims that the\nschool voucher program’s diversion of enrollment and public funding to non-\npublic schools impedes the Board’s “ability to implement” the requirements of\nthe consent decree (Doc. 876) in the areas of student assignment and facilities.\n      On October 22, 2012, the district court issued an “Order and Reasons”\n(Doc. 1066, Exhibit “E”) compelling the State Officials to appear before the court\non October 30, 2012 and “show cause, if any they can, as to why a preliminary\ninjunction should not be entered herein restraining, enjoining and prohibiting\nthe State Officials’ further implementation of LA. R.S. § 17:4016 that otherwise\nwould off-set the Tangipahoa Parish School District’s local contribution against\nMinimum Foundation Program Funding to be allocated” to Tangipahoa and why\na mandatory preliminary injunction should not enter ordering the State Officials\nto immediately commence funding to Tangipahoa if the voucher-funds recipient-\nstudents return to public schools.\n      Following argument at a hearing on November 26, 2012, the district court\norally denied the State Officials’ motions, granted a preliminary injunction, and\n\n                                        22\n\f   Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 23    Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\ninstructed the parties to submit proposed orders consistent with the court’s oral\nreasons. On November 28, 2012, the district court entered the Order proposed\nby the desegregation parties (Doc. 1063, Exhibit “B”) thus broadly enjoining the\nSchool Officials from implementing the school-voucher program in Tangipahoa\nParish.\n      The following day, November 29, 2012, the district court issued an Order\n(Doc. 1065, Exhibit “C”) denying the State Officials’ request for a stay pending\nappeal in part because “state law, not imposed by the preliminary injunction,\nprovides an available option for reallocating agency resources. See LA. R.S.\n24:653(F).” On November 30, 2012, the district court issued an “Order and\nWritten Reasons” (Doc. 1066, Exhibit “E”) denying the State Officials’ “Motion\nTo Set Aside the Granting of the Two All Writs Motions” (Plaintiffs’ Doc. 1031;\nDefendants’ Doc. 1021).\n      The State Officials, in accordance with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure, moved this court to stay a portion of the preliminary\ninjunction rendered November 28, 2012.

Further, “when the state-law questions have concerned\nmatters peculiarly within the province of the local courts, [the Court has]\ninclined toward abstention.” Id. at 83-84 (citations omitted). In this regard,\n      [a]mong the cases that call most insistently for abstention are those\n      in which the federal constitutional challenge turns on a state\n      statute, the meaning of which is unclear under state law. If the\n      state courts would be likely to construe the statute in a fashion that\n      would avoid the need for a federal constitutional ruling . . . , the\n      argument for abstention is strong.\nId. at 84. Thus, when there is a “substantial uncertainty as to the meaning of\nstate law” and “a reasonable possibility that the state court’s clarification of\nstate law might obviate the need for a federal constitutional ruling,” the district\ncourt must abstain from adjudicating the federal constitutional claim. Erwin\nChemerinsky, FEDERAL JURISDICTION § 12.2, at 818 (6th ed. 2012).               This\nproposition is mirrored in our precedent, under which, if a decision on the state\nlaw issue would make adjudication of the federal constitutional challenge\nunnecessary, the district court must abstain.

As\ndescribed in more detail below, Pullman abstention is clearly and immediately\nwarranted in this case. Indeed, the majority agrees that Pullman abstention is\ncalled for but treats it as an optional, malleable doctrine that it may delay and\nmerge with its determination of whether the appeal is likely to succeed under\nthe Nken four-factor test. This is grievous, compounded error. Because of the\nnature of the Pullman doctrine, it applies only to decide when federal courts\nshould abstain or refrain from further adjudication of a claim because its\nresolution may be mooted by a state-court decision and not, as the majority\nmisuses it, to predict whether a defense on the merits will be successful on\nappeal under Nken.       Pullman abstention is designed to stop potentially\n\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\f    Case: 12-31218         Document: 00512111311        Page: 25   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 12-31218\n\nunnecessary federal litigation in its tracks and therefore should have nothing to\ndo with perpetuating federal litigation on appeal.\n                                              1.\n      In the case before us, the criteria warranting Pullman abstention plainly\nhave been met. First, a state trial court in Baton Rouge has declared Act 2\ninvalid under the Louisiana State Constitution as an unauthorized reassignment\nof students and diversion of MFP funds away from public schools and into non-\npublic schools,1 and that decision is now pending on direct appeal to the\nLouisiana Supreme Court.2 The State Officials, as well as the majority, agree\nthat if the state supreme court affirms the trial court’s decision, this federal\nlitigation will be moot, because in the absence of the 2012 state law there will be\nno diversion of public funds for private tuition or reassignment of students to\nnon-public schools. Given that the parties challenging Act 2’s constitutionality\nprevailed in the state trial court, there is sufficient uncertainty as to the\nmeaning of state law (namely, whether Act 2 comports with the commands of the\nLouisiana State Constitution). Especially noteworthy in this regard is that the\nstate court ruled Act 2 unconstitutional on the basis of a unique provision of the\nLouisiana State Constitution—one without analog in the U.S. Constitution\n—providing that funds dedicated jointly by the legislature and the BESE under\nthe MFP formula for Louisiana’s public-schools systems must be directed to\npublic parish and city school boards that administer those systems and may not\nbe diverted unilaterally by the legislature to non-public schools.

This is double error because\nPullman abstention should be ordered immediately when it appears that federal\nlitigation may be an unnecessary entanglement and interference with state law;\nand the Pullman abstention criteria do not relate to the merits of the district\ncourt’s injunction. Rather, Pullman is an independent doctrine, predicated on\nfederalism, the avoidance of unnecessary federal constitutional rulings through\nabstention, and the value of allowing state courts to resolve sensitive and unique\nstate issues first, before proceeding with federal litigation. On this basis,\nPullman requires analysis independent from that conducted under Nken to\ndecide whether to stay the district court judgment while the federal litigation\ncontinues on appeal.\n       Second, despite acknowledging that Pullman should apply, the majority\nerroneously concludes that the appeal may continue and that the State Officials’\nmotion for a stay pending appeal should be granted.

Once it is determined that the Pullman doctrine is\napplicable, we lack any discretion to proceed otherwise.\n      Third, in connection with Pullman abstention we should certify the\nquestion regarding Act 2’s constitutionality under the Louisiana State\nConstitution to the Louisiana Supreme Court. Certification is appropriate\nbecause, even though the issue has already been appealed to the state high court\nour certification of it may expedite resolution of this potentially dispositive\nquestion and will serve the goals of abstention and avoidance by obviating the\nneed to rule on the petitioners’ federal constitutional challenge. As the Court\nwrote in Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, “Pullman abstention [has]\nproved protracted and expensive in practice, for it entail[s] a full round of\nlitigation in the state court system before any resumption of proceedings in\nfederal court.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118093\"><a href=\"/opinion/118093/arizonans-for-official-english-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (1997); see also Chemerinsky, supra, § 12.3, at\n840 (noting that the procedure, followed under Pullman and requiring parties\nto litigate state-law claims in state court first, “commonly takes many years and\nimposed substantially increased costs on litigants”). “Certification procedure,\nin contrast, allows a federal court faced with a novel state-law question to put\nthe question directly to the State’s highest court, reducing the delay, cutting the\ncost, and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response.”\nArizonans, 520 U.S. at 76; see also Lehman Bros. v.

The State Officials Are Not Entitled to Sovereign\n      Immunity from Suit in Federal Court To Enjoin Them from\n     Thwarting and Interfering with a Valid Desegregation Order\n      Contrary to the majority’s decision, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar\nthe district court’s enforcement of the federal consent decree and desegregation\norder by enjoining the State Officials from frustrating, interfering with, or\nthreatening to dismantle those federal orders by executing a state law that\nsharply conflicts with the federal decrees by authorizing, inter alia,\nreassignment of public school students to non-public schools and the increasing\ndiversion of state MFP funds away from the parish’s public-school system to pay\nfor transfer students’ non-public school tuition.\n      As the Supreme Court held in Frew v. Hawkins, a case such as this\n“involves the intersection of two areas of federal law: the reach of the Eleventh\nAmendment and the rules governing consent decrees.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (2004).\nAs the Supreme Court explained:\n      The Eleventh Amendment confirms the sovereign status of the\n      States by shielding them from suits by individuals absent their\n      consent. To ensure the enforcement of federal law, however, the\n      Eleventh Amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief\n      against state officials acting in violation of federal law. This\n      standard allows courts to order prospective relief as well as\n      measures ancillary to appropriate prospective relief. Federal courts\n      may not award retrospective relief, for instance, money damages or\n      its equivalent, if the State invokes its immunity.\nId. (citations omitted).   This case is not a suit for money damages or its\nequivalent against the State, but rather a suit for an injunction requiring the\nState Officials to conform their conduct to federal constitutional law as\ninterpreted by Brown and its progeny and as set forth in the desegregation\nconsent decree entered in this case in 1965 and updated by succeeding\ndesegregation orders, the most recent being the 2012 desegregation order.\n\n\n\n\n                                       29\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 30   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\n       “Consent decrees have elements of both contracts and judicial decrees.”\nId. Thus, “[a] consent decree ‘embodies an agreement of the parties’ and is also\n‘an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be\nenforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable\nto other judgments and decrees.’” Id. And “[c]onsent decrees entered in federal\ncourt must be directed to protecting federal interests.” Id. In Firefighters v.\nCleveland, the Court “observed that a federal consent decree must spring from,\nand serve to resolve, a dispute within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction;\nmust come within the general scope of the case made by the pleadings; and must\nfurther the objectives of the law upon which the complaint was based.” Id.\n(citing </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111748\"><a href=\"/opinion/111748/firefighters-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (1986)).\n      Here, the State Officials do not contend that the terms of the consent\ndecree or desegregation order were impermissible under Brown and Jefferson\nCounty. Nor do they contend that the consent decree failed to comply with\nFirefighters. Rather, the officials challenge only the district court’s means of\nenforcement of the decree and order, not their validity or entry.\n      The state officials rely heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision in\nPennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), and the\nEleventh Circuit’s decision in DeKalb County School District v.

Pennhurst and DeKalb County, which relies primarily\non Pennhurst, however, are distinguishable. In those cases, the courts found the\nrationale of Ex parte Young inapplicable to suits brought against state officials\nalleging violations of state-law. 465 U.S. at 106; 109 F.3d at 688. Jurisdiction\nwas thus improper because “[a] federal court’s grant of relief against state\nofficials on the basis of state-law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not\nvindicate the supreme authority of federal law.” Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106.\nHere, by contrast, the law to be enforced is not state law but federal law,\nembodied in a federal consent decree and desegregation order that was entered\n\n                                       30\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 31   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\nto implement the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as interpreted\nby Brown and its progeny. This is the federal law which the State Officials have\nbeen enjoined from frustrating or threatening to dismantle.\n      Therefore, this case is governed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Ex\nparte Young and its progeny in which the Court has striven to harmonize the\nprinciples of state sovereign immunity with the effective supremacy of rights and\npowers secured elsewhere in the Constitution. When a suit is brought only\nagainst state officials, as in the present case, a question arises as to whether that\nsuit is a suit against the State itself. Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101. “Although\nprior decisions of [the Supreme] Court have not been entirely consistent on this\nissue, certain principles are well established.” Id. For instance, the Eleventh\nAmendment bars a suit against state officials when “the state is the real,\nsubstantial party in interest.” Ford Motor Co. v. Dep’t of Treasury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104057\"><a href=\"/opinion/104057/ford-co-v-dept-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n464 (1945). “The general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign if ‘the\njudgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or\ninterfere with the public administration,’ or if the effect of the judgment would\nbe ‘to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.’” Dugan v.\nRank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106566\"><a href=\"/opinion/106566/dugan-v-rank/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (1963) (citations omitted). However,\n       [t]he Court has recognized an important exception to this general\n       rule: a suit challenging the constitutionality of a state official's\n       action is not one against the State. This was the holding in Ex parte\n       Young, . . . in which a federal court enjoined the Attorney General\n       of the State of Minnesota from bringing suit to enforce a state\n       statute that allegedly violated the Fourteenth Amendment. This\n       Court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not prohibit issuance\n       of this injunction.      The theory of the case was that an\n       unconstitutional enactment is “void” and therefore does not “impart\n       to [the officer] any immunity from responsibility to the supreme\n       authority of the United States.” Since the State could not authorize\n       the action, the officer was “stripped of his official or representative\n       character and [was] subjected to the consequences of his official\n       conduct.\n\n\n                                         31\n\f    Case: 12-31218        Document: 00512111311     Page: 32   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-31218\n\nPennhurst, 465 U.S. at 102 (citation omitted). Further,\n          [w]hile the rule permitting suits alleging conduct contrary to “the\n          supreme authority of the United States” has survived, the theory of\n          Young has not been provided an expansive interpretation. Thus, in\n          Edelman v. Jordan, . . . the Court emphasized that the Eleventh\n          Amendment bars some forms of injunctive relief against state\n          officials for violation of federal law. In particular, Edelman held\n          that when a plaintiff sues a state official alleging a violation of\n          federal law, the federal court may award an injunction that governs\n          the official's future conduct, but not one that awards retroactive\n          monetary relief. Under the theory of Young, such a suit would not\n          be one against the State since the federal-law allegation would strip\n          the state officer of his official authority.\nId. at 102-03. Thus, prospective injunctive relief against a state officer does not\namount to retroactive relief that would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\nSee id.\n\n      Applying the foregoing principles, it is clear that the district court’s\ninjunction of the State Officials’ future unconstitutional conduct that would\ncontravene federal law by frustrating and threatening defeat of the federal\nconsent decree and desegregation order, based on federal constitutional law, is\nnot a suit or an injunction against the state. Nor does the district court’s\ninjunction violate the Eleventh Amendment by granting retroactive relief against\nthe state or any state official or by ordering the payment of any compensation for\npast wrongs by the state or its officers.\n\n      The majority does not disagree with the principles enunciated by the\nSupreme Court in Ex parte Young and its progeny as set forth above. Instead,\nthe majority totally mischaracterizes the district court’s injunction by incorrectly\nstating that it is “an award of monetary relief against the State’s treasury,” Slip\nOp. at 8; that it requires the State “to answer what is essentially a claim for\ncontribution from one of its subdivisions in federal court,” Slip Op. at 9; and that\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 33   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\n“this matter does not involve a party seeking a state official’s compliance with\nfederal law that will indirectly cost the state more money,” Slip Op. at 8.\n\n      A fair and accurate reading of the record demonstrates that the district\ncourt’s injunction merely requires the State Officials to conform their prospective\nconduct to federal law as stated in the desegregation consent decree and orders;\nand that it does not order the state to contribute anything from its treasury or,\nfor that matter, to do anything at all. Indeed, because the state has not been\nmade a party, the injunction applies only against the State Officials and orders\nthat their “implementation of [Act 2] of the 2012 Regular Session of the Louisiana\nLegislature be enjoined in accordance with this Court’s previous order,” in which\nthe district court stated that its injunction would apply to restrain them\nprospectively from frustrating the court’s implementation of the desegregation\nconsent decree and orders.\n\n      The majority’s implicit argument that Superintendent White may not be\nenjoined under Ex parte Young because there is no claim that he has violated\nfederal law or acted outside of his official capacity is without merit. The\nLouisiana State Constitution places general duties on him and the members of\nthe BESE to administer Act 2 of the Regular Session of the 2012 Legislature. See\nLA. CONST. art. 8, §§ 2, 13. Act 2 itself more specifically places a duty on them to\ntake actions that would violate federal law by frustrating the district court’s\nimplementation of its desegregation consent decree and orders. Under Ex parte\nYoung, in making an officer of the state a defendant in a suit to enjoin the\nunconstitutional enforcement of a state law, the officer must have some\nconnection with the enforcement of the act. “The fact that the state officer, by\nvirtue of his office, has some connection with the enforcement of the act, is the\nimportant and material fact, and whether it arises out of the general law, or is\nspecially created by the act itself, is not material so long as it exists.” Ex parte\n\n\n                                        33\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 34   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-31218\n\nYoung, 209 U.S. at 157; see also K.P. v.

As the Supreme Court has stated:\n\n       [The Young] doctrine has existed alongside our sovereign-immunity\n       jurisprudence for more than a century, accepted as necessary to\n       “permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.” It rests on\n       the premise—less delicately called a “fiction[]”—that when a federal\n       court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain from\n       violating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign-immunity\n       purposes.\nVa.

See Slip Op. at\n4-5, 11-15; see also Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. The State Officials have not met this\nburden. Instead, their only argument regarding the All Writs Act is that the Act\n“cannot serve as an independent basis for jurisdiction.” See Texas v. Real Parties\nin Interest, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24818\"><a href=\"/opinion/24818/state-of-texas-v-real-parties/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392 (5th Cir. 2001).5 However, no one disputes that the\ndistrict court already possessed an independent basis for the exercise of\njurisdiction: namely, the decades-old desegregation suit out of which the 2010\nconsent decree arose and is still under the district court’s supervision. Thus, the\nState Officials’ argument misses the mark and, moreover, does not constitute a\nstrong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits as required by Nken.\n      Given the State Officials’ terse All Writs Act analysis, the majority has\nseen fit to supply the State Officials’ argument for them.

Slip Op. at 12. The meager options the majority suggests\nare twofold: (1) entreat the State Legislature to either provide greater funding or\nrepeal Act 2; or (2) rely on the pending state-court proceeding addressing the\nconstitutionality of Act 2 under the Louisiana State Constitution.          See id.\nHowever, and as the district court observed in its November 30 order, the\npending state-court proceeding does not address compliance with the 2010\nconsent decree nor how Act 2 will affect Tangipahoa’s ability to achieve unitary\nstatus; that issue would be beyond the scope of that proceeding. Although\nresolution of the pending state-court suit may moot the need for further federal\nlitigation, this factor is addressed to Pullman abstention, see supra, not the first\nfactor for invocation of the All Writs Act, which asks whether recourse to the\nstate-court litigation will enable the petitioners to assert their claim that the\nState Officials’ administration of Act 2 frustrates and defeats the school board’s\ncompliance with the 2010 consent decree. Moreover, given that the state trial\ncourt declined to enjoin the voucher program, timely access to relief is not\navailable to petitioners. See Stephanie Simon, Louisiana Voucher Program Ruled\nUnconstitutional,         The     Huffington       Post,     Nov.    30,    2012,\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/30/judge-rules-louisiana-sch_n_222096\n2.html. Regarding whether the petitioners should be required to lobby the\nlegislature, relief from that body not only is speculative but also ignores that,\nabsent the injunctive relief requested, the petitioners’ ability to comply with the\nconsent decree will be undermined and severely frustrated.\n      Second, the majority contends that the petitioners have not shown that\ntheir right to the writ is “clear and indisputable” because they allegedly rely on\nspeculation and general financial information to show the harm that Act 2\ncreates. See Slip Op. at 12. The district court noted that the applicability of the\nAll Writs Act in this very context (namely, allowing a federal court to enforce its\nconsent decrees) is well established.        Moreover, the majority’s argument\n\n                                        36\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 37   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\nimpermissibly shifts the burden from the State Officials requesting a stay to the\npetitioners who have successfully convinced the district court that application of\nthe All Writs Act is warranted. The district court is in a better position, having\nsupervised the underlying desegregation suit for decades and overseen countless\nhours of careful negotiations between the parties, to judge what will and will not\naffect Tangipahoa’s compliance with the consent decree.

The majority’s analysis, then, robs the district court of the\ndeference we are required to pay to the court’s determination that Act 2 is a\nthreat to compliance with the federal constitutionally required consent decree\nand unitary system conversion plan. See Tasby, 771 F.2d at 855 .\n      Third, the majority reasons that issuance of the writ was not appropriate\nunder the circumstances because only one-quarter of one percent of\nschoolchildren in the parish are affected, at this point in time in the first year of\nthe voucher program. Again, this pays little fealty to the considered wisdom and\ncommon sense of the district court’s judgment and, moreover, ignores the\n\n                                         37\n\f    Case: 12-31218      Document: 00512111311        Page: 38   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-31218\n\ndetermination that the number of schoolchildren participating in the voucher\nprogram, thereby abandoning the public schools in Tangipahoa and depriving\nthem of much-needed funding, undoubtedly will increase in future. For the\nforegoing reasons, I do not believe the State Officials have satisfied their burden\nof making a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits regarding the\ndistrict court’s utilization of the All Writs Act.\n           D. The State Officials Have Failed To Satisfy Their\n           Burden of Demonstrating All Four Nken Factors To\n                     Justify a Stay Pending Appeal\n      The State Officials bear the burden of satisfying all four Nken factors in\norder to warrant a stay pending appeal. See 556 U.S. at 434. Despite this, the\nState Officials have satisfied none.\n      First, the State Officials have failed to make a strong showing of a\nlikelihood of success on the merits. Even assuming that analysis under the\nEleventh Amendment and Pullman doctrine is appropriately subsumed under\nNken’s first factor—a contention with which I take great issue given the\njurisdiction-sapping nature of affirmative answers under either doctrine—the\nState Officials’ arguments based on the Eleventh Amendment, Pullman, and the\nAll Writs Act fail to demonstrate a strong showing of a likelihood of success on\nthe merits. Thus, the State Officials must make a strong showing in some other\nfashion.\n      In this regard, the State Officials bear the burden of strongly showing that\nthe district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction to\nhalt Act 2’s interference with the consent decree in Tangipahoa.

See id.; Tasby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n855. The district court determined, based in part on the testimony, discussions,\n\n                                         38\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311        Page: 39   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-31218\n\nand evidence it considered in formulating its consent decree and unitary-school-\nsystem plan, that the operation of Act 2 in Tangipahoa would undermine or\nunduly impede the school board’s ability to comply with the consent decree and\nthe goal of achieving unitary status. Thus, the State Officials are obliged to make\na strong showing that the diversion of MFP funding away from the public-school\nsystem and into non-public schools via the use of vouchers by schoolchildren\nopting out of the former to attend the latter, would not interfere with or\nundermine the district court’s carefully crafted consent decree and unitary school\nsystem plan, which was based on projections measuring public-school enrollment\nand the corresponding allocation of MFP funds to Tangipahoa by the State. I\nparticularly note that the State Officials introduced no evidence to show that Act\n2’s unilateral diversion of MFP funds and enrollment from public schools to non-\npublic schools would not interfere with and undermine the district court’s consent\ndecree and unitary public school system plan for Tangipahoa public schools.\nThey did not show—nor, I question, could they—that the diversion of MFP\nfunding from Tangipahoa would not affect the meticulous requirements imposed\non the school system, including the construction of new facilities, the\nimprovement of old ones, new teacher-training requirements, school programs,\nand student assignments.          Instead, the State Officials simply argued that\nTangipahoa received slightly more MFP funds for the 2012-2013 school year than\nit received for the 2011-2012 school year. This argument did not take into\naccount the added burdens imposed upon the Tangipahoa public system by the\ndistrict court’s consent decree and unitary plan in the next and succeeding years.\nBecause of a lack of evidence and failure to acknowledge that growth in profits\nwithout accounting for added debt does not guarantee financial health, the State\nOfficials have failed to satisfy their burden of making a strong showing of\nlikelihood of success in reversing the district court’s findings and judgment with\nrespect to Nken’s first factor.\n\n                                          39\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311      Page: 40   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-31218\n\n      Second, the State Officials have failed to make out an irreparable injury as\nrequired by Nken’s second factor. Our temporary stay of the injunction on\nDecember 14, 2012 permitted the payment of the fifty children’s vouchers on\nDecember 17, 2012 and the continued implementation of Act 2 in Tangipahoa.\nThis undercuts the majority’s contention that the fifty participating\nschoolchildren would have to relocate absent timely payments during the school\nyear. See Slip Op. at 15. Further, even under the injunction’s terms, the loss of\nvouchers by the fifty schoolchildren currently enrolled in the voucher program in\nTangipahoa neither substantially nor irreparably would have injured the voucher\nprogram or the affected children. The schoolchildren would have remained\nentitled to free public education by the Tangipahoa school district and Act 2\nwould have been temporarily stopped only as to fifty students in one public-school\ndistrict out of sixty-nine statewide. Therefore, even if we had not issued our\ntemporary stay of the injunction, no irreparable injury would have befallen the\nstate or the fifty children due to the district court’s judgment.\n      Regarding the third and fourth Nken factors—whether the stay will\nsubstantially harm the petitioners and a determination of where the public\ninterest lies—the State Officials have also failed to satisfy Nken’s commands. In\nparticular, the State Officials rely solely on their assertion that the school board\nin fact received more funding this year than it did last year. But, as mentioned\npreviously, the State Officials’ argument fails to take into account the burdens\nthe school system will be obligated to discharge in the future; essentially, the\nState Officials are reading only one side of Tangipahoa’s profit-and-loss\nstatement. Showing that neither the public interest in public education nor the\nTangipahoa public school system, within the context of the consent decree and\nunitary plan, will be harmed by the Act 2 voucher program requires a much more\ncomplex analysis. The additional burdens on the Tangipahoa public school\n\n\n\n                                        40\n\f    Case: 12-31218     Document: 00512111311       Page: 41   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-31218\n\nsystem by the consent decree and unitary school system plan, as well as other\nfactors such as demographics and inflation, would have to be taken into account.\n      The majority’s attempt to minimize the harm that will befall petitioners if\nthey are unable to comply with consent decree, as well as their assertion that\nNken’s last two factors are “less significant” ignores that State Officials’ burden\nin satisfying all four factors. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434; Slip Op. at 15-16.\nAdditionally, the district court observed that the expansion of non-public schools\nin and around the parish concomitant with the enactment of Act 2, as well as the\nlikely increase in the number of students availing themselves of vouchers, would\nfurther destabilize the carefully crafted consent decree. Doc. No. 1066, at 12-13.\nUnder the third Nken factor, it is up to the State Officials to demonstrate that the\npetitioners will not be substantially harmed. See id. It is not the role of the\nmajority, conceding that Act 2 interferes with the school board’s ability to comply\nwith the consent decree, see Slip Op. at 16, to assert that Act 2 does not interfere\nwith Tangipahoa’s compliance enough. All this leads to the conclusion that the\nState Officials have failed to carry their burden with respect to Nken’s third and\nfourth factors. Based on this and foregoing, the State Officials have failed to\ncarry their burden and thus demonstrate that a stay is warranted based on an\napplication of the Nken factors.\n                                   CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s refusal\nto grant the State Officials’ request to order Pullman abstention in this case by\nreversing the district court’s judgment and remanding the case to it for federal-\ncourt abstention; from the majority’s improper use of the doctrines of sovereign\nimmunity and Pullman abstention in its Nken analysis; from its determination\nthat sovereign immunity bars the district court’s injunction issued to restrain the\nState Officials from doing nothing more than violating federal law embodied in\nthe district court’s desegregation consent decree and orders; and from its\n\n                                        41\n\f    Case: 12-31218    Document: 00512111311      Page: 42   Date Filed: 01/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-31218\n\nerroneous determination that the State Officials satisfied their burden with\nrespect to all four factors under Nken.\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f</pre>",
