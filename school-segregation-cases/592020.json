M oseley appeals from the district court’s grant of\n\njudgment in favor of the Albuquerque Public Schools (APS) on his claim under\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and its grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of APS on his claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n\n1973 (§ 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II). Our\n\njurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we dismiss M r. M oseley’s appeal\n\nbecause all of his claims are now moot.\n\n\n\n                                   Background\n\n      In 2003, when M r. M oseley was a student at D el Norte High School in\n\nAlbuquerque, his parents filed an ID EA due process request against A PS on his\n\nbehalf. The request also alleged disability discrimination under § 504. The\n\nrequest w as based in part on the failure of APS to provide M r. M oseley with\n\nassistive technology, specifically real-time captioning.\n\n      M r. M oseley is deaf, has visual tracking problems, and suffers from\n\nattention deficit disorder. After the IDEA due process hearing, the D ue Process\n\n                                          -2-\n\fHearing Officer (DPH O) found in pertinent part that APS had denied M r. M oseley\n\na free appropriate public education (FAPE) because it failed to fully evaluate\n\nw hether real-time captioning w as appropriate for M r. M oseley. The DPHO,\n\nhow ever, found no evidence of discrimination in violation of § 504. 1 An\n\nAdministrative A ppeals Officer (AAO) reversed the D PHO’s finding that M r.\n\nM oseley required real-time captioning to receive a FAPE, but affirmed the\n\nrejection of the § 504 claim.\n\n      The IDEA guarantees that children with disabilities have access to “a free\n\nand appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related\n\nservices designed to meet their unique needs.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d). To meet this\n\ngoal, the IDEA provides federal funding to state and local agencies and requires\n\nthem to provide each child with an Individual Education Plan (IEP). See T.S. v.\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 54, 265 F.3d 1090, 1091 (10th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535\n\nU.S. 927 (2002). “An IEP is a written statement that includes such matters as the\n\nchild’s level of educational performance, annual goals, services to be provided to\n\nthe child and the like.” Id. (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)). A school district\n\nsatisfies its obligation to provide a FAPE “by providing personalized instruction\n\nwith sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from\n\nthat instruction.” Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 203 (1982). The IDEA\n\n      1\n        The jurisdiction of the DPHO to consider § 504 claims concurrently with\nIDEA claims has since been eliminated. See N.M . Admin. Code\n§ 6.31.2.13(H)(1) & (I)(1).\n\n                                        -3-\n\frequires that a plaintiff exhaust two tiers of administrative review prior to filing\n\nsuit in state or federal court. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415 (f)-(g), (i)(2).\n\n      Section 504 and Title II are anti-discrimination statutes. Plaintiffs\n\nasserting violations of the IDEA often assert claims under § 504 and Title II as\n\nwell. Section 504 provides:\n\n      No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United\n      States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by\n      reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in,\n      be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\n      program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Title II provides:\n\n      [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n      disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits\n      of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\n      subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n\n      W hile attending Del Norte, M r. M oseley received special education\n\nservices because of his disability. M ost deaf students at Del Norte were placed in\n\nsegregated classes, but one third, including M r. M oseley, were placed in general\n\neducation classes for the entirety of the school day. As part of his IEP, M r.\n\nM oseley received, among other services, supports, modifications, and\n\naccommodations: access to written class notes, reduced assignments and\n\nhomework, extra time for oral and written responses, testing accommodations,\n\nand the use of an interpreter.\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      Before M r. M oseley began high school, his family had requested that APS\n\nconsider providing some form of real-time captioning so that M r. M oseley could\n\naccess class lectures and discussions without the use of an interpreter. During\n\nM r. M oseley’s sophomore year, APS provided real-time captioning to him for a\n\nnine-week trial period in the English 10 class. The specific form of real-time\n\ncaptioning provided to M r. M oseley was called Communication Access Real Time\n\nCaptioning (CART). 2\n\n      To summarize the record, M r. M oseley scored slightly better when working\n\nwith an interpreter than he did when using CA RT. Consequently, the APS IEP\n\nTeam concluded that CART was not required for M r. M oseley because his\n\nperformance under CART did not significantly differ from his performance when\n\nworking with an interpreter and there was no evidence that the use of interpreters\n\nwas inappropriate. APS’s decision to discontinue CART prompted M r. M oseley\n\nto file the IDEA due process request w hich demanded provision of CART for his\n\n11th grade chemistry class, provision of captioned videos and films, further\n\nteacher training and certification, provision of adequate transition services (to\n\ncollege), provision of IEP modifications and accommodations, and provision of an\n\nadvanced sign language class.\n\n\n\n      2\n         CART requires an operator, similar to a court reporter, who keys\ndialogue into a machine which then generates text that can be read. In this case,\nthe use of C ART in English 10 produced approximately 50 pages of hard\ntranscript per day.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      The ID EA due process hearing was held on September 16-19 and October 3\n\nof M r. M oseley’s 11th grade year (2003-2004). 3 The D PHO concluded that M r.\n\nM oseley did require CART for a full semester, with an evaluation of the services\n\nto follow, in order for him to have a FAPE as required by the IDEA . APS\n\nappealed this decision to the second-tier of IDEA review, the AAO. The AAO\n\nconcluded that CART was not necessary for M r. M oseley to receive a FAPE. The\n\nAAO did, however, find deficiencies in M r. M oseley’s IEP modifications and\n\naccommodations and ordered several other remedies. It found for A PS on all\n\nother matters.\n\n      M r. M oseley’s parents then brought suit on his behalf in the district court\n\nagainst APS and the New M exico Public Education Department (NM PED). They\n\nasserted claims on behalf of M r. M oseley and also sought class certification on\n\nbehalf of all deaf students attending APS schools from 2002-2004 who were\n\nentitled to special education services. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that APS\n\nviolated the IDEA, § 504, and Title II by failing to provide deaf students with a\n\nnumber of technologies and services, including real-time captioning and college\n\ntransition services.\n\n      NM PED moved to dismiss the class action claims, and that motion was\n\n\n\n      3\n          “W hen parents believe their child is not being provided a FAPE in the\nleast restrictive environment, they are entitled to an impartial due process hearing\n. . . .” Ellenberg v. N.M . M ilitary Inst., – F.3d –, 2007 W L 678438, at *3 (10th\nCir. M arch 7, 2007).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fgranted. Aplt. App. at 77-80, 83-84. The district court concluded that class\n\ncertification was inappropriate because only M r. M oseley had exhausted his\n\nclaims, and it would not be futile for the prospective class members to pursue\n\nadministrative remedies. 4 The district court then amended its order to reinstate\n\nthe class action claims against APS, as only the N M PED had moved to dismiss\n\nthose claims. Doc. 60 at 5-6 (M emo. Op. & Order dated 11/12/2004). The\n\ndistrict court later considered APS’s motion for judgment on M r. M oseley’s\n\nindividual IDEA claim and its motion for summary judgment on M r. M oseley’s §\n\n504 and Title II claims. Applying the standard for a FAPE set out in Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. at 188-89, the district court found that the services provided to M r. M oseley\n\nwere sufficient under the IDEA. Relying on Urban v. Jefferson County School\n\nDistrict, 89 F.3d 720, 727-28 (10th Cir. 1996), the district court then granted\n\nsummary judgment for the § 504 and Title II claims because it determined that\n\ndenial of the IDEA claim precluded the § 504 and Title II claims as all three\n\nclaims shared the same substantive standard and the same set of facts gave rise to\n\neach. 5\n\n\n          4\n        Judicial review of an IDEA claim is generally permitted only after a\nclaimant exhausts state administrative remedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2).\n          5\n         W e recognize that the district court’s disposition of the § 504 and Title II\nclaims is arguably in conflict with our holding in Ellenberg that it was error for\nthe district court to dismiss a plaintiff’s § 504 and Title II claims because the\nplaintiff failed to properly exhaust his IDEA administrative remedies. 2007 W L\n678438, at *11-12. In Ellenberg, the plaintiff alleged facts sufficient to prove a\n“pure discrimination claim[].” Id. at *12. In this case, M r. M oseley seems to\n\n                                         -7-\n\f      O n appeal, M r. M oseley argues that the district court erred in its review:\n\n(1) by failing to consider additional evidence, imposing a requirement for\n\nsubsequent exhaustion on CART, and deferring to the AAO on factual issues\n\ndependent on credibility, (2) by improperly dismissing M r. M oseley’s § 504 and\n\nTitle II claims by conflating their substantive standards with that of the IDEA,\n\nand (3) by concluding, on the merits, that M r. M oseley received a FAPE and was\n\nnot discriminated against under § 504 and Title II.\n\n\n\n                                     Discussion\n\n      Before this appeal was filed, M r. M oseley graduated from high school. W e\n\nordered supplemental briefing to determine w hether this fact rendered M r.\n\nM oseley’s claims moot. In the complaint, M r. M oseley asked that the district\n\ncourt reverse the decision of the AAO and declare APS to be in violation of the\n\nIDEA, § 504, and Title II. He also asked that the district court enjoin APS from\n\nfurther discrimination against him because of his deafness, that it award him\n\nattorney’s fees and costs, and that it grant any other appropriate relief. W hile the\n\ncomplaint requested an aw ard of compensatory damages for class members, M r.\n\nM oseley never requested compensatory damages as an individual, nor did he seek\n\n\n\n\nbase his § 504 and Title II claims on entirely the same facts as his ID EA claim.\nNevertheless, because M r. M oseley’s claims are moot, we need not decide the\nimport of Ellenberg in this case.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fto amend the complaint.\n\n      M r. M oseley did not contest his graduation, 6 so his request to reverse the\n\ndecision of the AAO and to declare APS to be in violation of the IDEA, § 504,\n\nand Title II will have no effect on the present or future actions of either party.\n\nSee T.S., 265 F.3d at 1092 (“Once a student has graduated, he is no longer\n\nentitled to a FAPE; thus any claim that a FAPE was deficient becomes moot upon\n\na valid graduation.”); Bd. of Educ. v. Nathan R., 199 F.3d 377, 381 (7th Cir.\n\n2000) (same). M r. M oseley’s graduation also moots his request for an injunction\n\nagainst APS, as plaintiffs “seeking prospective relief must show more than past\n\nharm or speculative future harm.” Lippoldt v. Cole, 468 F.3d 1204, 1217 (10th\n\nCir. 2006). Likewise, M r. M oseley’s general request for other appropriate relief\n\nis moot. While M r. M oseley’s counsel tried mightily at oral argument to\n\n\n\n      6\n         “The IDEA requires that school districts educate disabled students to\ntw enty-one years of age, unless doing so is inconsistent w ith state law.”\nBirmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist., 220 F.3d 850, 853 (8th Cir. 2000) (citing 20\nU.S.C. § 1412(a)). Nevertheless, a disabled student may graduate earlier than the\nage of twenty-one if certain procedural safeguards are followed. See id. W hen a\nschool district intends to graduate a student before the student has reached the age\nof twenty-one, it must give prior written notice to the student’s parents regarding\nthis pending change in “educational placement.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(3); 34\nC.F.R. § 300.102(a)(3)(iii). The student’s parents may then file a “complaint”\nwith the school, contesting the graduation. See id. § 1415(b)(6)(A). The filing of\nsuch a complaint entitles the parents to an “impartial due process hearing” at the\nadministrative level, where they may present arguments as to why continued\neducation is necessary for the student to receive a FAPE. See id. § 1415(f)(1)(A).\nFollowing exhaustion of an administrative appeal, see id. § 1415(g)(1), the\nparents may then challenge the proposed graduation by bringing an action in\nfederal district court, see id. § 1415(i)(2).\n\n                                         -9-\n\fconvince us that there was some effective equitable remedy that could be\n\nfashioned, counsel could not articulate what form such a remedy might take. W e\n\nstruggle to see what equitable remedy this court could impose, given that M r.\n\nM oseley has already graduated from high school and cannot return to Del Norte.\n\n      Based on the facts, the only effective relief M r. M oseley could claim comes\n\nin the form of compensatory damages. W hile most circuits hold that the IDEA\n\ndoes not permit compensatory damages, 7 see Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451\n\nF.3d 13, 28 (1st Cir. 2006); Gean v. Hattaw ay, 330 F.3d 758, 774 (6th Cir. 2003);\n\nSellers v. Sch. Bd., 141 F.3d 524, 526-27 (4th Cir. 1998); Charlie F. v. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 98 F.3d 989, 991 (7th Cir. 1996); Heidemann v. Rother, 84 F.3d 1021,\n\n1033 (8th Cir. 1996), a plaintiff may recover compensatory damages under § 504\n\nand Title II in certain circumstances, see Powers v. M JB Acquisition Corp., 184\n\nF.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that compensatory damages are\n\navailable under § 504 upon a showing of intentional discrimination); Davoll v.\n\nW ebb, 194 F.3d 1116, 1141 (10th Cir. 1999) (suggesting, but not explicitly\n\nholding, that proof of intentional discrimination is required for compensatory\n\ndamages under Title II). Thus, M r. M oseley’s § 504 and Title II claims would be\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        This court has yet to decide w hether the ID EA permits compensatory\ndamages. See Cudjoe v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 12, 297 F.3d 1058, 1067 n.10 (10th\nCir. 2002). W hile we see no reason to depart from the majority view, such a\ndetermination is not necessary in this case because M r. M oseley never sought\ncompensatory damages as an individual.\n\n                                       - 10 -\n\fjusticiable if he had sought compensatory damages. See Taxpayers for Animas-\n\nLa Plata Referendum v. Animas-La Plata W ater Conservancy Dist., 739 F.2d\n\n1472, 1479 (10th Cir. 1984) (“[B]y definition claims for past damages cannot be\n\nmoot.”).\n\n      Nevertheless, M r. M oseley never prayed for compensatory damages. The\n\ncomplaint did seek compensatory damages for class members, but not for M r.\n\nM oseley individually. Regardless, the class action claims against the NM PED\n\nwere dismissed on motion, and the final order in this case effectively dismissed\n\nthe class action claims against A PS by granting judgment in favor of defendants\n\non all remaining claims contained in the complaint. Aplt. App. at 306. No appeal\n\nwas taken from the class action rulings and no evidence suggesting compensatory\n\ndamages ever surfaced in the district court.\n\n      The IDEA does entitle plaintiffs to claim monetary awards in the form of\n\nreimbursement for services that a school wrongfully failed to provide, see Sch.\n\nComm. v. Dep’t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 370-71 (1985), and may also provide\n\nplaintiffs with the remedy of compensatory education services when they have\n\nbeen denied a FAPE, see Urban, 89 F.3d at 727 (noting that this circuit has yet to\n\ndecide whether compensatory education services are available under the IDEA to\n\nremedy denial of a FAPE). Nevertheless, as noted above, M r. M oseley failed to\n\nrequest either reimbursement or compensatory education services in his\n\ncomplaint. The tenor of the entire complaint and proceedings in this action is for\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\finjunctive relief.\n\n      Finally, because the underlying substantive claims are moot, M r. M oseley\n\ncannot recover attorney’s fees and costs. See Nathan R., 199 F.3d at 381. In\n\nshort, M r. M oseley seeks no effective form of relief. M r. M oseley argues that the\n\nID EA itself says nothing about a student’s claims terminating upon graduation.\n\nThis may be true, but if M r. M oseley’s claims present no live controversy, they\n\nare not justiciable under the Constitution. See Lippoldt, 468 F.3d at 1216; see\n\nalso M atos ex rel. M atos v. Clinton Sch. Dist., 367 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nW hile M r. M oseley insists that his claims present a live controversy because the\n\nIDEA allows for reimbursement and compensatory education services, M r.\n\nM oseley never requested such relief, nor can he articulate any equitable relief that\n\nwould present a live controversy. W e are obliged, under our independent duty to\n\nexamine our own jurisdiction, see Airport Neighbors Alliance, Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 90 F.3d 426, 428 (10th Cir. 1996), to dismiss his appeal as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\f",

M oseley appeals from the district court’s grant of\n\njudgment in favor of the Albuquerque Public Schools (APS) on his claim under\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and its grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of APS on his claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n\n1973 (§ 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II). Our\n\njurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we dismiss M r. M oseley’s appeal\n\nbecause all of his claims are now moot.\n\n\n\n                                   Background\n\n      In 2003, when M r. M oseley was a student at D el Norte High School in\n\nAlbuquerque, his parents filed an ID EA due process request against A PS on his\n\nbehalf. The request also alleged disability discrimination under § 504. The\n\nrequest w as based in part on the failure of APS to provide M r. M oseley with\n\nassistive technology, specifically real-time captioning.\n\n      M r. M oseley is deaf, has visual tracking problems, and suffers from\n\nattention deficit disorder. After the IDEA due process hearing, the D ue Process\n\n                                          -2-\n\fHearing Officer (DPH O) found in pertinent part that APS had denied M r. M oseley\n\na free appropriate public education (FAPE) because it failed to fully evaluate\n\nw hether real-time captioning w as appropriate for M r. M oseley. The DPHO,\n\nhow ever, found no evidence of discrimination in violation of § 504. 1 An\n\nAdministrative A ppeals Officer (AAO) reversed the D PHO’s finding that M r.\n\nM oseley required real-time captioning to receive a FAPE, but affirmed the\n\nrejection of the § 504 claim.\n\n      The IDEA guarantees that children with disabilities have access to “a free\n\nand appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related\n\nservices designed to meet their unique needs.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d). To meet this\n\ngoal, the IDEA provides federal funding to state and local agencies and requires\n\nthem to provide each child with an Individual Education Plan (IEP). See T.S. v.\n\nIndep. Sch.

The IDEA\n\n      1\n        The jurisdiction of the DPHO to consider § 504 claims concurrently with\nIDEA claims has since been eliminated. See N.M . Admin. Code\n§ 6.31.2.13(H)(1) & (I)(1).\n\n                                        -3-\n\frequires that a plaintiff exhaust two tiers of administrative review prior to filing\n\nsuit in state or federal court. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415 (f)-(g), (i)(2).\n\n      Section 504 and Title II are anti-discrimination statutes. Plaintiffs\n\nasserting violations of the IDEA often assert claims under § 504 and Title II as\n\nwell. Section 504 provides:\n\n      No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United\n      States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by\n      reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in,\n      be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\n      program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Title II provides:\n\n      [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n      disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits\n      of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\n      subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n\n      W hile attending Del Norte, M r. M oseley received special education\n\nservices because of his disability. M ost deaf students at Del Norte were placed in\n\nsegregated classes, but one third, including M r. M oseley, were placed in general\n\neducation classes for the entirety of the school day. As part of his IEP, M r.\n\nM oseley received, among other services, supports, modifications, and\n\naccommodations: access to written class notes, reduced assignments and\n\nhomework, extra time for oral and written responses, testing accommodations,\n\nand the use of an interpreter.\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      Before M r. M oseley began high school, his family had requested that APS\n\nconsider providing some form of real-time captioning so that M r. M oseley could\n\naccess class lectures and discussions without the use of an interpreter. During\n\nM r. M oseley’s sophomore year, APS provided real-time captioning to him for a\n\nnine-week trial period in the English 10 class. The specific form of real-time\n\ncaptioning provided to M r. M oseley was called Communication Access Real Time\n\nCaptioning (CART). 2\n\n      To summarize the record, M r. M oseley scored slightly better when working\n\nwith an interpreter than he did when using CA RT. Consequently, the APS IEP\n\nTeam concluded that CART was not required for M r. M oseley because his\n\nperformance under CART did not significantly differ from his performance when\n\nworking with an interpreter and there was no evidence that the use of interpreters\n\nwas inappropriate. APS’s decision to discontinue CART prompted M r. M oseley\n\nto file the IDEA due process request w hich demanded provision of CART for his\n\n11th grade chemistry class, provision of captioned videos and films, further\n\nteacher training and certification, provision of adequate transition services (to\n\ncollege), provision of IEP modifications and accommodations, and provision of an\n\nadvanced sign language class.\n\n\n\n      2\n         CART requires an operator, similar to a court reporter, who keys\ndialogue into a machine which then generates text that can be read. In this case,\nthe use of C ART in English 10 produced approximately 50 pages of hard\ntranscript per day.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      The ID EA due process hearing was held on September 16-19 and October 3\n\nof M r. M oseley’s 11th grade year (2003-2004). 3 The D PHO concluded that M r.\n\nM oseley did require CART for a full semester, with an evaluation of the services\n\nto follow, in order for him to have a FAPE as required by the IDEA . APS\n\nappealed this decision to the second-tier of IDEA review, the AAO. The AAO\n\nconcluded that CART was not necessary for M r. M oseley to receive a FAPE. The\n\nAAO did, however, find deficiencies in M r. M oseley’s IEP modifications and\n\naccommodations and ordered several other remedies. It found for A PS on all\n\nother matters.\n\n      M r. M oseley’s parents then brought suit on his behalf in the district court\n\nagainst APS and the New M exico Public Education Department (NM PED). They\n\nasserted claims on behalf of M r. M oseley and also sought class certification on\n\nbehalf of all deaf students attending APS schools from 2002-2004 who were\n\nentitled to special education services. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that APS\n\nviolated the IDEA, § 504, and Title II by failing to provide deaf students with a\n\nnumber of technologies and services, including real-time captioning and college\n\ntransition services.\n\n      NM PED moved to dismiss the class action claims, and that motion was\n\n\n\n      3\n          “W hen parents believe their child is not being provided a FAPE in the\nleast restrictive environment, they are entitled to an impartial due process hearing\n. . . .” Ellenberg v. N.M . M ilitary Inst., – F.3d –, 2007 W L 678438, at *3 (10th\nCir. M arch 7, 2007).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fgranted. Aplt. App. at 77-80, 83-84. The district court concluded that class\n\ncertification was inappropriate because only M r. M oseley had exhausted his\n\nclaims, and it would not be futile for the prospective class members to pursue\n\nadministrative remedies. 4 The district court then amended its order to reinstate\n\nthe class action claims against APS, as only the N M PED had moved to dismiss\n\nthose claims. Doc. 60 at 5-6 (M emo. Op. & Order dated 11/12/2004). The\n\ndistrict court later considered APS’s motion for judgment on M r. M oseley’s\n\nindividual IDEA claim and its motion for summary judgment on M r. M oseley’s §\n\n504 and Title II claims. Applying the standard for a FAPE set out in Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. at 188-89, the district court found that the services provided to M r. M oseley\n\nwere sufficient under the IDEA. Relying on Urban v. Jefferson County School\n\nDistrict, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153661\"><a href=\"/opinion/153661/urban-v-jefferson-co-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 727-28 (10th Cir. 1996), the district court then granted\n\nsummary judgment for the § 504 and Title II claims because it determined that\n\ndenial of the IDEA claim precluded the § 504 and Title II claims as all three\n\nclaims shared the same substantive standard and the same set of facts gave rise to\n\neach. 5\n\n\n          4\n        Judicial review of an IDEA claim is generally permitted only after a\nclaimant exhausts state administrative remedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2).\n          5\n         W e recognize that the district court’s disposition of the § 504 and Title II\nclaims is arguably in conflict with our holding in Ellenberg that it was error for\nthe district court to dismiss a plaintiff’s § 504 and Title II claims because the\nplaintiff failed to properly exhaust his IDEA administrative remedies. 2007 W L\n678438, at *11-12. In Ellenberg, the plaintiff alleged facts sufficient to prove a\n“pure discrimination claim[].” Id. at *12. In this case, M r. M oseley seems to\n\n                                         -7-\n\f      O n appeal, M r. M oseley argues that the district court erred in its review:\n\n(1) by failing to consider additional evidence, imposing a requirement for\n\nsubsequent exhaustion on CART, and deferring to the AAO on factual issues\n\ndependent on credibility, (2) by improperly dismissing M r. M oseley’s § 504 and\n\nTitle II claims by conflating their substantive standards with that of the IDEA,\n\nand (3) by concluding, on the merits, that M r. M oseley received a FAPE and was\n\nnot discriminated against under § 504 and Title II.\n\n\n\n                                     Discussion\n\n      Before this appeal was filed, M r. M oseley graduated from high school. W e\n\nordered supplemental briefing to determine w hether this fact rendered M r.\n\nM oseley’s claims moot. In the complaint, M r. M oseley asked that the district\n\ncourt reverse the decision of the AAO and declare APS to be in violation of the\n\nIDEA, § 504, and Title II. He also asked that the district court enjoin APS from\n\nfurther discrimination against him because of his deafness, that it award him\n\nattorney’s fees and costs, and that it grant any other appropriate relief. W hile the\n\ncomplaint requested an aw ard of compensatory damages for class members, M r.\n\nM oseley never requested compensatory damages as an individual, nor did he seek\n\n\n\n\nbase his § 504 and Title II claims on entirely the same facts as his ID EA claim.\nNevertheless, because M r. M oseley’s claims are moot, we need not decide the\nimport of Ellenberg in this case.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fto amend the complaint.\n\n      M r. M oseley did not contest his graduation, 6 so his request to reverse the\n\ndecision of the AAO and to declare APS to be in violation of the IDEA, § 504,\n\nand Title II will have no effect on the present or future actions of either party.\n\nSee T.S., 265 F.3d at 1092 (“Once a student has graduated, he is no longer\n\nentitled to a FAPE; thus any claim that a FAPE was deficient becomes moot upon\n\na valid graduation.”); Bd. of Educ. v.

Nevertheless, a disabled student may graduate earlier than the\nage of twenty-one if certain procedural safeguards are followed. See id. W hen a\nschool district intends to graduate a student before the student has reached the age\nof twenty-one, it must give prior written notice to the student’s parents regarding\nthis pending change in “educational placement.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(3); 34\nC.F.R. § 300.102(a)(3)(iii). The student’s parents may then file a “complaint”\nwith the school, contesting the graduation. See id. § 1415(b)(6)(A). The filing of\nsuch a complaint entitles the parents to an “impartial due process hearing” at the\nadministrative level, where they may present arguments as to why continued\neducation is necessary for the student to receive a FAPE. See id. § 1415(f)(1)(A).\nFollowing exhaustion of an administrative appeal, see id. § 1415(g)(1), the\nparents may then challenge the proposed graduation by bringing an action in\nfederal district court, see id. § 1415(i)(2).\n\n                                         -9-\n\fconvince us that there was some effective equitable remedy that could be\n\nfashioned, counsel could not articulate what form such a remedy might take.

Dep’t of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111420\"><a href=\"/opinion/111420/burlington-school-comm-v-mass-dept-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370-71 (1985), and may also provide\n\nplaintiffs with the remedy of compensatory education services when they have\n\nbeen denied a FAPE, see Urban, 89 F.3d at 727 (noting that this circuit has yet to\n\ndecide whether compensatory education services are available under the IDEA to\n\nremedy denial of a FAPE). Nevertheless, as noted above, M r. M oseley failed to\n\nrequest either reimbursement or compensatory education services in his\n\ncomplaint. The tenor of the entire complaint and proceedings in this action is for\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\finjunctive relief.\n\n      Finally, because the underlying substantive claims are moot, M r. M oseley\n\ncannot recover attorney’s fees and costs. See Nathan R., 199 F.3d at 381. In\n\nshort, M r. M oseley seeks no effective form of relief. M r. M oseley argues that the\n\nID EA itself says nothing about a student’s claims terminating upon graduation.\n\nThis may be true, but if M r. M oseley’s claims present no live controversy, they\n\nare not justiciable under the Constitution. See Lippoldt, 468 F.3d at 1216; see\n\nalso M atos ex rel. M atos v. Clinton Sch.

M oseley insists that his claims present a live controversy because the\n\nIDEA allows for reimbursement and compensatory education services, M r.\n\nM oseley never requested such relief, nor can he articulate any equitable relief that\n\nwould present a live controversy.
