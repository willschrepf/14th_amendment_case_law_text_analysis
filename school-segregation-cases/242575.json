The court generally disfavors the\ncitation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under\nthe terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\fBefore SEYMOUR, Chief Judge, BRORBY, and BRISCOE, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\n\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this\n\nappeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9. Therefore, the case is ordered\n\nsubmitted without oral argument.\n\n       Plaintiff Robert Shawn Treff, a Utah state prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights action. We exercise\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.\n\n       Treff’s complaint alleged he was removed from his regular cell on June 2, 1995,\n\nand placed in a special cell on “TRO” status for allegedly committing one or more\n\ndisciplinary infractions, and that he remained on “TRO” status until the charges were\n\nresolved on June 28, 1995. Treff alleged his due process and equal protection rights were\n\nviolated because his confinement on “TRO” status was unjustified and the disciplinary\n\ncharges were not resolved in a timely manner. He further alleged his Eighth Amendment\n\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was violated because the special cell\n\nwas “inherently unsafe, unmonitored and punitive in nature,” and because he was denied\n\ndirect sunlight, showers, and yard time on several occasions. He also alleged defendants’\n\nactions caused “great emotional stress, loss of his job, loss of schooling, loss of a proper\n\nand accurate evaluation for redetermination of his sentence, loss of visitation and equal\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fprivileges of similarly situated inmates.” Complaint at 11.\n\n       Although Treff paid the full filing fee, the district court sua sponte dismissed the\n\ncomplaint before it was served on defendants, finding the complaint failed to state a claim\n\nupon which relief could be granted. Treff contends on appeal the district court acted\n\nimproperly in sua sponte dismissing his complaint, and that payment of the full filing fee\n\nentitled him to service of his complaint on defendants.\n\n       We reject Treff’s arguments. The 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)\n\n“was intended to curtail what was perceived to be the over involvement of federal courts\n\nin managing state prison systems,” and “to stem the tide of frivolous prisoner suits.”\n\nHadix v. Johnson, ___ F.3d ___, 1998 WL 177343 *4 (6th Cir. 1998). The PLRA added\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1915A, which requires a district court to “review, before docketing, if\n\nfeasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil\n\naction in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or\n\nemployee of a governmental entity.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a). The district court is required\n\nto dismiss a prisoner’s civil complaint if it concludes it “is frivolous, malicious, or fails to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1).\n\n       Because Treff satisfied the definition of “prisoner” in § 1915A(c) and he filed a\n\ncivil suit against employees of a governmental entity, § 1915A(a) required the district\n\ncourt to conduct an initial screening of the complaint prior to service on the named\n\ndefendants, notwithstanding the fact that Treff had paid the filing fee. Moreover, because\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fthe court concluded the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\n\ngranted, it was required to dismiss the complaint pursuant to § 1915A(b)(1). In short, we\n\nconclude the court acted properly in dismissing the complaint without first allowing\n\nservice on defendants.\n\n       As for the merits of Treff’s complaint, which we review de novo, we agree that it\n\nfails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. See McGore v. Wrigglesworth,\n\n114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir. 1997) (referring to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A); Kidd v. Taos Ski\n\nValley, Inc., 88 F.3d 848, 854 (10th Cir. 1996) (referring to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)).\n\nTreff’s twenty-six days of disciplinary segregation failed to encroach upon a due process\n\nliberty interest because it did not “impose[] atypical and significant hardship on [Treff] in\n\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484\n\n(1995). Nor did the disciplinary confinement violate Treff’s equal protection rights.\n\nUnless Treff is a member of a suspect class or a fundamental right is at stake (neither of\n\nwhich Treff alleged), disparate treatment need only be rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental purpose to satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. Riddle v. Mondragon, 83\n\nF.3d 1197, 1207 (10th Cir. 1996). Maintaining jail security is a legitimate governmental\n\npurpose, and prison officials have wide discretion to determine measures to be taken to\n\npreserve order and security in a detention facility. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-\n\n85 (1987). Determining a particular inmate (in this case Treff) has committed\n\ndisciplinary infractions and imposing corresponding disciplinary segregation are certainly\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fwithin that discretion and do not violate equal protection. The allegations in the\n\ncomplaint concerning conditions of confinement fail to demonstrate Treff was denied\n\n“the minimal civilized measures of life’s necessities,” or that any of the defendants acted\n\nwith “deliberate indifference” to his health or safety. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n\n834 (1994).\n\n       AFFIRMED.
