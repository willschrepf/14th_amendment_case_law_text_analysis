Code, § 3250 et\nseq.),1 a firefighter has the right to review and respond to any negative comment\nthat is “entered in his or her personnel file, or any other file used for any personnel\npurposes by his or her employer.” (§ 3255.) This case presents the question\nwhether section 3255 gives an employee the right to review and respond to\nnegative comments in a supervisor‟s daily log, consisting of notes that\nmemorialize the supervisor‟s thoughts and observations concerning an employee,\nwhich the supervisor uses as a memory aid in preparing performance plans and\nreviews. We hold that here, because the log was not shared with or available to\nanyone other than the supervisor who wrote the log, it does not constitute a file\n\n\n\n1      References to statutes are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\f“used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer” and section 3255 does\nnot apply.\n                                      I. FACTS\n       Captain Culp, plaintiff Steve Poole‟s supervisor, maintained what he called\na “daily log” regarding each of the employees that he supervised. He created the\nlog using both a computer and handwritten notes. He created a separate file for\neach employee, stored on a flash drive and also in hard copy, which he kept in his\ndesk with the employee‟s name on it. He included in the log “[a]ny factual\noccurrence or occurrences that would aid [him] in writing a thorough and fair\nannual review.” He kept these logs throughout the time he was supervising each\nemployee. Culp would address with the employee behavior recorded in the log\nabout which he had concerns, and if the behavior nevertheless continued it might\nbe mentioned in the performance review.\n       Culp kept the log concerning plaintiff from December of 2008 to July of\n2010. He used the log as a reference in preparing annual reviews and assessments\nof plaintiff‟s performance under a performance improvement plan. The daily log\nprepared by Culp regarding plaintiff included many descriptions of plaintiff‟s\nactivities on the job and his interactions with Culp, noting both positive and\nnegative aspects of plaintiff‟s behavior. Some of the incidents described in the log\nwere included in plaintiff‟s annual performance reviews and his assessments under\na performance improvement plan. For example, the log notes several incidents in\nwhich plaintiff failed to complete his assigned duties in cleaning up the fire\nstation. As also noted in the log, Culp addressed his concerns with plaintiff before\nthe annual evaluation in an attempt to correct plaintiff‟s behavior, and plaintiff‟s\nperformance on cleanup duties was addressed in a performance improvement plan.\nPlaintiff‟s annual performance review indicated that this was an area in which he\nneeded to continue to show improvement.\n\n                                          2\n\f       Many incidents recorded in the log were never included in a review. For\nexample, Culp noted in the log that plaintiff left a training class early one day and\nwent outside to talk on his cell phone. Culp later discussed the incident with\nplaintiff and his log notes indicate that plaintiff explained that he had already\ntaken that class and passed the associated examination. The log also describes a\ntraining session conducted in a stressful environment during which plaintiff\nbecame very anxious. Culp discussed this incident with plaintiff and offered him\nadditional training. Neither of these incidents was mentioned in plaintiff‟s annual\nperformance review.\n       From time to time Culp discussed his concerns about plaintiff‟s\nperformance with Culp‟s own supervisor, Battalion Chief Phillips, Office Chief\nCamargo, human resources personnel, and attorneys for the Orange County Fire\nAuthority, relating some of the incidents recorded in his daily log. But he did not\nshare the log itself with them and he did not allow other employees to review the\ndaily log.\n       Plaintiff had the opportunity to review all of his performance evaluations,\nwhich he understood were then placed in his personnel file at headquarters. When\nhe went to the human resources department at headquarters and asked to see his\npersonnel file he was allowed to review it and make copies of his performance\nevaluations. Plaintiff showed a copy of his performance evaluation to a union\nrepresentative, Bob James. The level of documentation in the review caused\nJames to wonder whether Culp may have been maintaining a file on plaintiff at the\nstationhouse. James demanded that Culp provide him with a copy of plaintiff‟s\n“station file,” and Culp gave him a copy of his daily log regarding plaintiff.\n       Shortly thereafter, plaintiff wrote to the director of human resources of the\nOrange County Fire Authority, asserting that the inclusion of negative comments\nin Culp‟s daily log without providing plaintiff an opportunity to review those\n\n                                          3\n\fcomments violated Government Code section 3255. He requested that all negative\ncomments be removed from the log and that all “personnel files” be made\navailable for his inspection. In response, the fire authority denied his request,\nasserting that section 3255 did not apply to Captain Culp‟s “supervisory notes.”\n       Plaintiff and the Orange County Professional Firefighters Association filed\na petition and complaint in the superior court, seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, damages, civil penalties, and a writ of mandate directing defendants to\ncomply with section 3255 before including adverse comments in plaintiff‟s\npersonnel files. After a trial based on the papers (including transcripts of\ndepositions of both plaintiff and Culp), the trial court denied relief, concluding that\nCulp‟s daily log was not subject to section 3255. The trial court observed, “If\nCulp made a negative note about [plaintiff] in his notes, but did not address it in\nthe yearly evaluation, it does not exist, at least for personnel purposes.”\n       The Court of Appeal reversed. It reasoned that the daily log constituted a\n“file used for . . . personnel purposes” (§ 3255) because a substandard\nperformance evaluation was based on adverse comments contained in the daily log\nand because Culp orally revealed some of the contents of the daily log to his\nbattalion chief. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that section 3255\nrequired that plaintiff be given an opportunity to respond to the negative\ncomments in the log before they were “made known to the employer.” We\ngranted review.\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n       Because this appeal involves the application of a statute to undisputed facts,\nour review is de novo. (See Southern California Edison Co. v. State Board of\nEqualization (1972) 7 Cal.3d 652, 659.)\n       The Firefighters Procedural Bill of Rights Act (the Act) provides\nfirefighters with certain rights concerning their employment. (§ 3250 et seq.) At\n\n                                           4\n\fissue here is section 3255, which provides that “[a] firefighter shall not have any\ncomment adverse to his or her interest entered in his or her personnel file, or any\nother file used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer, without the\nfirefighter having first read and signed the instrument containing the adverse\ncomment indicating he or she is aware of the comment.” (§ 3255.) The firefighter\nhas 30 days to respond, in writing, to an adverse comment, and “[t]he written\nresponse shall be attached to, and shall accompany, the adverse comment.”\n(§ 3256.)\n       Captain Culp, the author of the daily log, was the only person who had\naccess to it. He discussed some of the incidents described within it with his\nsuperiors and with human resources personnel, but it is undisputed that he did not\npermit them to review the log itself. To the extent Culp used any of the adverse\ncomments contained in the log in any review or assessment of plaintiff‟s\nperformance, those comments were shared with plaintiff in accordance with\nsection 3255. The question presented under these undisputed facts is whether\nnegative comments contained in a document memorializing a supervisor‟s own\nthoughts and observations that is not itself made available to or shared with\nanyone else comes within section 3255. As explained below, we conclude that\nany negative comments contained in the log that were not included in a\nperformance review or performance improvement plan concerning plaintiff were\nnot entered in a file “used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer.”\n(§ 3255.)\n       The Act does not define the phrase “used for any personnel purposes by his\nor her employer.” In discerning the scope and meaning of section 3255, “ „[w]e\nbegin with the plain language of the statute, affording the words of the provision\ntheir ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context,\nbecause the language employed in the Legislature‟s enactment generally is the\n\n                                          5\n\fmost reliable indicator of legislative intent.‟ [Citations.] The plain meaning\ncontrols if there is no ambiguity in the statutory language.” (People v. Cornett\n(2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265.) In interpreting a statutory provision, “our task is to\nselect the construction that comports most closely with the Legislature‟s apparent\nintent, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes‟ general\npurpose, and to avoid a construction that would lead to unreasonable, impractical,\nor arbitrary results.” (Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) 39 Cal.4th\n1272, 1291.)\n       The statutory language referring to a file “used for any personnel purposes\nby his or her employer” might, in isolation, be read broadly enough to include\nCulp‟s log, which he used in the performance of his duties as a supervisor. But\ncritical to an understanding of section 3255 is its statutory context. (See Horwich\nv. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 276 [“ „we do not construe statutes in\nisolation, but rather read every statute with “reference to the entire scheme of law\nof which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain\neffectiveness.” ‟ ”]; McMahon v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 172 Cal.App.4th\n1324, 1332 (McMahon) [when construing language in the Public Safety Officers\nBill of Rights Act, “we must read it in context, as part of a comprehensive\nlegislative scheme”].) Reading the statutory language in context convinces us that\nthe Legislature did not intend section 3255 to be read so broadly.\n       Section 3255 is one of three neighboring provisions of the Act that concern\nthe rights of firefighters with respect to their personnel files. Section 3255\nrequires the employer to inform the firefighter of any comment adverse to his or\nher interest in a personnel file or any other file used by the employer for personnel\npurposes. Section 3256 entitles a firefighter to respond in writing to any adverse\ncomment “entered in his or her personnel file” and the response “shall be attached\nto, and shall accompany, the adverse comment.” Section 3256.5 entitles a\n\n                                          6\n\ffirefighter to inspect “personnel files that are used or have been used to determine\nthat firefighter‟s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional\ncompensation, or termination or other disciplinary action.” (§ 3256.5, subd. (a).)\nIf, after reviewing the file, “the firefighter believes that any portion of the material\nis mistakenly or unlawfully placed in the file, the firefighter may request, in\nwriting, that the mistaken or unlawful portion be corrected or deleted.” (§ 3256.5\nsubd. (c).) The employer must respond to the request in writing, and both the\nrequest and the response become part of the personnel file. (§ 3256.5, subds. (c),\n(d).)\n        As subdivision (a) of section 3256.5 makes clear, the Legislature was not\nconcerned with any and all files that might in some sense be connected with\npersonnel matters; the Legislature was, rather, specifically concerned with\n“personnel files that are used or have been used to determine th[e] firefighter‟s\nqualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation, or\ntermination or other disciplinary action.” It is true that the other provisions use\nslightly different formulations to refer to the covered “files.” But it is reasonable\nto interpret the three provisions in parallel, given that they appear to operate in\nparallel, and in the service of the same general goal — “to facilitate the officer‟s\nability to respond to adverse comments potentially affecting the officer‟s\nemployment status.” (McMahon, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1332 [describing\nthe nearly identical provisions of the statutes applicable to public safety\nofficers].)2\n\n2      Section 3255 is virtually identical to a statute applicable to public safety\nofficers (§ 3305), and it establishes rights regarding adverse comments that are\nvery similar to those that have been granted to teachers. (Ed. Code, § 44031,\nsubd. (d)(1).) Consequently, cases interpreting those statutes are relevant to our\ninterpretation of section 3255.\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f        As we have observed, an employee‟s “personnel file serves as a permanent\nrecord of his employment; derogatory information placed in that record may be\nused against the employee long after the informant becomes unavailable. Thus the\nstatute provides the employee with the concurrent right to place on the record\nmaterial in rebuttal.” (Miller v. Chico Unified School Dist. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 703,\n713 (Miller).) Section 3256 requires that the employee‟s response to adverse\ncomments “shall be attached to, and shall accompany, the adverse comment.”\n(§ 3256.) Similarly, section 3256.6 permits the firefighter to request that any\nmaterial in the personnel file that is unlawfully placed there or mistaken be\nremoved or corrected, and both the request and any response by the employer\n“become part of the personnel file.” (§ 3256.5, subds. (c), (d).) These statutes\nensure that the employee‟s response is made part of the written record, so that any\nindividual who accesses that record will have access to the employee‟s response as\nwell as to the adverse comment. Thus, the Legislature appears to have included\nthe phrase “any other file used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer”\nin section 3255 to ensure that employers will not be able to evade the statute‟s\nprotections by basing personnel decisions on materials contained in files that are\nnot designated as the agency‟s official personnel files. Thus, read in context, the\nphrase should be interpreted to encompass any written or computerized record\nthat, although not designated a personnel file, can be used for the same purposes as\na file of the sort described in section 3256.5 — as a record that may be used by the\nemployer to make decisions about promotion, discipline, compensation, and the\nlike.\n        A supervisor‟s log that is used solely to help its creator remember past\nevents does not fall within the scope of that definition. Even if a supervisor uses\nhis or her notes to help draft performance evaluations and other documents that\nultimately are placed in a personnel file, the notes themselves are not a file\n\n                                          8\n\fpreserved by the employer for use in making decisions about the firefighter‟s\nemployment status. Here, Culp was not plaintiff‟s employer. Plaintiff does not\ncontend, and nothing in the record demonstrates, that Culp himself had the\nauthority to take adverse disciplinary actions, such as demotions or discharge,\nagainst plaintiff on behalf of his employer, the Orange County Fire Authority.\nCulp‟s comments thus could adversely affect plaintiff only if and when they were\nplaced in a personnel file or in some other form to which the employer — that is,\nthose who had the authority to discipline plaintiff — had access.\n       Cases applying similar statutes are consistent with this conclusion. They\nhave held that a document containing adverse comments may come within the\ndisclosure requirement even if not formally entered into the official personnel file,\nif the document was either (1) maintained in such a manner that it would be\navailable to those making personnel decisions in the future, or (2) was actually\nused by the employer in making a personnel decision, or both. For example, in\nMiller, supra, 24 Cal.3d at page 707, applying Education Code section 44031, we\nheld that Miller, a school principal, must be permitted to review and respond to\n“derogatory written material compiled and maintained by a school district even\nthough the material has not been properly placed in his personnel file” because\nthat material had been used by the school board in its decision to transfer Miller to\na teaching position. Miller‟s supervisor used his “ „personal notes and calendar‟ ”\nto dictate a summary of “ „meetings, contacts, occurrences, and events‟ ” (Miller,\nat p. 711) involving Miller, which were transcribed in the form of 20 memoranda\nthat were submitted to the school board for its use in deciding whether to reassign\nthe plaintiff from a position as principal to a teaching position. (Miller, supra, at\np. 714.) “[T]he board received [these] confidential memoranda without first\nallowing plaintiff the opportunity to correct any inaccurate derogatory information\ncontained therein.” (Ibid.) We rejected the school board‟s argument that these\n\n                                          9\n\fmemoranda were never “ „entered or filed‟ ” in plaintiff‟s personnel file, stating\nthat an employer “may not avoid the requirements of the statute by maintaining a\n„personnel file‟ for certain documents relating to an employee, segregating\nelsewhere under a different label materials which may serve as a basis for\naffecting the status of the employee‟s employment.” (Id. at pp. 712-713.)\n       In County of Riverside v. Superior Court (2002) 27 Cal.4th 793, we held\nthat the county was required to disclose to a police officer who had been\nprovisionally hired, and then fired, derogatory material in a file containing the\nresults of a background investigation the county undertook to determine whether\nto continue to employ him. The investigatory file was actually used in the\ndecision to fire the officer, and it would also be available in the future “to every\nlaw enforcement agency to which [the fired officer] applies.” (Id. at p. 803.) “We\nthink it would elevate form over substance and also permit an end run around the\nBill of Rights Act were we to hold that a law enforcement agency could avoid the\nAct simply by first terminating the employee and then placing its adverse\ncomments in the employee‟s personnel file.” (Ibid.)\n       Similarly, cases from the courts of appeal have concluded that disclosure\nrequirements apply to adverse comments about a police officer even though they\nwere not entered into the officer‟s official personnel file, and even though they had\nnot been used in making any personnel decision, when those files might be\navailable to persons making personnel decisions in the future. In Sacramento\nPolice Officers Assn. v. Venegas (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 916 (Venegas), the\nappellate court concluded that an index card maintained in the name of a police\nofficer by the internal affairs department, which listed all complaints that had been\nmade against him, was a file “ „used for . . . personnel purposes‟ ” because it\nwould be available to those responsible for disciplinary action. “The Legislature\nappears to have been concerned with the potential unfairness that may result from\n\n                                          10\n\fan adverse comment that is not accompanied by punitive action and, thus, will\nescape the procedural protections available during administrative review of a\npunitive action.” (Id. at p. 926.) The court observed that “internal affairs\npersonnel could be influenced to a peace officer employee‟s detriment in a future\ninvestigation if the officer‟s internal affairs file or index card contains an\nunexplained or unrebutted adverse comment.” (Id. at p. 929.) Furthermore,\nmanagement of the officer‟s employing agency had access to these cards and,\nalthough complaints that had been found to be frivolous, unfounded, or exonerated\ncould not be used for punishment or promotional purposes, they could be used to\nrequire counseling or additional training. (Ibid.; see Pen. Code, § 832.5,\nsubd. (c)(2), (3); Gov. Code, § 3304, subd. (g).)\n       Likewise, in Aguilar v. Johnson (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 241, 246, the\nappellate court held that a police officer was entitled to review and respond to a\ncitizen‟s complaint that had been placed in a “confidential investigative file\nseparate from appellant‟s personnel file.” The complaint was not investigated and\nno action was taken on it. The court rejected the contention that uninvestigated\ncomplaints such as this one were not considered in making personnel decisions,\nconcluding that “[t]heir placement in an officer‟s personnel file could potentially\nlead to not only adverse personnel decisions but could also result in a more severe\npenalty being imposed in a subsequent disciplinary proceeding. Because of this\npotential adverse impact on the officer, the complaint is an „adverse comment‟\nwithin the meaning of these sections.” (Id. at pp. 249-250; see Seligsohn v. Day\n(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 518 [requiring disclosure of records of discrimination\ncomplaints filed about officer even though they were not maintained in the\nofficer‟s personnel file because they could have employment consequences in the\nfuture].) In contrast, McMahon, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1333, held that\ninvestigative files of a number of citizen complaints that had been made against an\n\n                                           11\n\fofficer, but had been determined to be unfounded, were not files used for\npersonnel purposes because, under the department‟s internal regulations and Penal\nCode section 832.5, the materials they contained could not be used in personnel\ndecisions.\n       In the present case, there is no evidence that Culp‟s log would be available\nto anyone making personnel decisions in the future. The log was available to no\none other than Culp himself. Many of the potentially negative comments\ncontained in the log were never included in any document made available to\nplaintiff‟s employer, because Culp either deemed the incidents inconsequential or\nresolved them in plaintiff‟s favor. And it is undisputed that the documents Culp\nprepared with the assistance of the log — plaintiff‟s performance evaluations and\nimprovement plan — were disclosed to plaintiff before they were entered into his\npersonnel file.\n       In concluding that section 3255 applied to Culp‟s log, the Court of Appeal\nfound this case to be analogous to Miller, supra, 24 Cal.3d 703. Miller, however,\nis not comparable. There was no contention in Miller that the supervisor‟s\n“ „personal notes and calendar‟ ” should have been disclosed to Miller. Rather, the\nstatute was triggered when Miller‟s supervisor transmitted the memoranda he\nprepared with the assistance of those notes to the school board for its use in\nmaking a decision about Miller‟s employment status. Likewise, in the present\ncase, the statute was triggered when the performance evaluation was entered into\nplaintiff‟s personnel file. Miller does not suggest an earlier triggering date.\n       We are not persuaded to the contrary by the Court of Appeal‟s reasoning.\nThe Court of Appeal asserted that “[l]ike the situation in Miller, information not\ncontained in [plaintiff‟s] main personnel file was presented to his employer prior\nto an adverse employment action by the employer. As in Miller, revealing the\ncontents of the daily logs to Battalion Chief Philips denied Poole the opportunity\n\n                                          12\n\fto respond to the adverse comments made known to the employer, contrary to the\nintent of the protective statutory enactment.” This case is distinguishable from\nMiller. It is undisputed that Culp did not share his log with anyone; he merely\ndiscussed with others some of the incidents that he had observed and also recorded\nin his log, preliminary to completing plaintiff‟s evaluations and performance\nimprovement plan. Nothing in the Act attempts to regulate a supervisor‟s\npreliminary verbal consultations with his superiors or human resources personnel\nprior to completing an evaluation. The statute plainly gives firefighters the right to\nreview and file a written response to certain documents. Its language cannot be\nstretched to include a right to file a written response to verbal communications.\n       The Court of Appeal expressed concern that denying the employee access\nto the supervisor‟s daily log would frustrate the Act‟s purpose of “providing\nfirefighters a right to meaningfully respond to adverse comments that may affect\npersonnel decisions concerning the firefighter.” It reasoned that although Culp\ncould use the notes to help him remember events that he included in annual\npersonnel evaluations, plaintiff could not be expected to remember the details of\nthese events “months and months later when he was finally made aware of the\nadverse comments in the course of a yearly performance review” and his ability to\ncorrect inaccurate or incomplete statements in the review would be impeded.\n       The problem identified by the Court of Appeal would exist to some degree\nregardless of whether a supervisor kept notes or simply relied on an excellent\nmemory. If performance reviews occur only annually, an employee may have a\ndifferent recollection from his or her supervisor of events occurring many months\nearlier, or may not recall those events at all. Unreasonable delay in informing an\nemployee about incidents that could affect his or her employment status might\nsometimes be prejudicial to the employee‟s ability to rebut an employer‟s\ncharacterization of the employee‟s conduct, but prejudice resulting from such\n\n                                         13\n\fdelay is not the issue that is addressed in section 3255. The only timing\nrequirement in section 3255 is the requirement that the employee have the\nopportunity to review the adverse comment before it is actually entered into the\nfile. There is a provision in the Act that addresses delay, in the context of\nallegations of misconduct. (§ 3254.) Generally, no punitive action may be taken\non an allegation of misconduct unless the investigation of the allegation is\ncompleted and the employee is notified of the proposed disciplinary action within\none year. (§ 3254, subd. (d).) Plaintiff, however, does not allege that section 3254\nwas violated or that there was any unreasonable delay in informing him of\nincidents that might cause him to receive a negative evaluation.\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n       The decision of the Court of Appeal is reversed.\n                                                        CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C. J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCHIN, J.\nCORRIGAN, J.\nLIU, J.\nCUÉLLAR, J.\nKRUGER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                 CONCURRING OPINION BY CUÉLLAR, J.\n\n\n\n       Today the court strikes a careful balance between firefighters‟ procedural\nprotections and the realities that supervisors confront when managing public\norganizations. The foundation for the court‟s opinion is its interpretation of the\nFirefighters Procedural Bill of Rights Act (Gov. Code, § 3250 et seq.), and the\nlogic of that interpretation is unassailable. I nonetheless write separately to\nunderscore an important principle about the interpretive responsibilities that are so\noften at the heart of what we do. The bottom line is this: however important it is\nto train our attention on the plain meaning of a statutory provision we are\nconstruing, we must read that provision as we do here — in its larger context —\nwhen deciding whether its meaning is plain.\n       Suppose a statute is enacted with provisions similar to the ones at issue in\nthis case. “Any public employee,” the statute provides, “has a right to review\npersonnel files that are used or have been used to determine the employee‟s\nqualifications for employment, promotion, or discipline.” The question later arises\nwhether a supervisor‟s hastily scrawled note on a napkin about a subordinate‟s\nperformance — subsequently placed in a file folder, and then digitally copied onto\na smartphone — constitutes a “personnel file,” and whether the supervisor‟s\noccasional glance at the napkin or the digital file before writing a more formal\nevaluation constitutes “use[] to determine the employee‟s qualifications for\nemployment, promotion, or discipline.” That the ordinary usage and dictionary\n                                          1\n\fdefinitions of terms like “file,” “use,” and “determine” would matter in answering\nthese questions is beyond question. (E.g., Ceja v. Rudolph & Sletten, Inc. (2013)\n56 Cal.4th 1113, 1121 [using ordinary usage and dictionary definitions to construe\n“good faith”].)\n       What would be difficult to defend, however, is the proposition that the\ninquiry should end without considering what the rest of the statute tells us about\nthe meaning of the phrase at issue. Does a separate statutory provision imply that\n“personnel file” is to be construed broadly or narrowly? Are electronic records\naddressed elsewhere in the statute? If a phrase like “used to determine the\nemployee‟s qualifications” is not explicitly defined in the statute, do other\nprovisions illuminate anything relevant about how the statutory scheme\nunderstands the limits of the procedural protections it affords?\n       The devil, in short, is in the details. And the details are elucidated by\ncontext — the statutory structure and the words of surrounding or related\nprovisions. The statute‟s structure and its surrounding provisions can reveal the\nsemantic relationships that give more precise meaning to the specific text being\ninterpreted, even if the text may have initially appeared to be unambiguous. 1\n\n1       In Apple Inc. v. Superior Court (2012) 56 Cal.4th 128, 133, for example,\nthe court construed Civil Code section 1747.08, which provides, “no person, firm,\npartnership, association, or corporation that accepts credit cards” shall request or\nrequire the cardholder to provide personal identification information and cause it\nto be recorded. The plaintiff argued that the plain statutory language applied to\nonline retailers selling electronically downloadable products. (Id. at pp. 136-137.)\nThe majority acknowledged the statute‟s plain meaning was consistent with the\nplaintiff‟s reading, but nonetheless rejected that construction based on the\nprovision‟s structure, context, and purpose. (Id. at pp. 137-139.) In California\nSchool Employees Association v. Governing Board (1994) 8 Cal.4th 333, 335-336,\nthe court construed Education Code section 88203, which provides that classified\ncommunity college employees are entitled to paid holidays including “every day\nappointed by the President . . . for a public fast, thanksgiving, or holiday . . . .”\n                                                           (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          2\n\f(Hodges v. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 109, 114 [interpreting the meaning\nof a provision “ „is to discern the sense of the statute, and therefore its words, in\nthe legal and broader culture‟ ”].) And context also tells us more about the\nstatute‟s underlying purpose than we might glean from reading the text of a\nstatutory provision in isolation. (Horwich v. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th\n272, 276 (Horwich) [explaining that understanding the Legislature‟s intended\npurpose requires consideration of a statute‟s structure and context].)\n        The majority‟s framework for interpreting Government Code section 3255\nappears very much in accord with these concerns. (See maj. opn., ante, at pp. 5-\n7.) That is, this court‟s approach to interpreting statutes emphasizes the primacy\nof the Legislature‟s intended purpose. (Goodman v. Lozano (2010) 47 Cal.4th\n1327, 1332 [“In interpreting a statute, our primary goal is to determine and give\neffect to the underlying purpose of the law”].) Giving effect to that purpose\nrequires us to start with a statute‟s text and to train our focus on the language\nrather than extrinsic interpretive aids such as legislative history when there is not\nsufficient textual ambiguity to warrant the use of such material. (Maj. opn., ante,\nat p. 5; Ennabe v. Manosa (2014) 58 Cal.4th 697, 713; Hsu v. Abbara (1995) 9\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that a 1991 presidential proclamation designating “National\nDays of Thanksgiving” to celebrate the end of the Persian Gulf War triggered paid\nholidays under the statute. (Id. at p. 336.) The court concluded that the plaintiffs‟\ninterpretation was consistent with clear and unambiguous statutory language, but it\nnonetheless declined to adopt that construction given what the rest of the statute\nconveyed about the Legislature‟s intended purpose. (Id. at pp. 340-342; see Cal.\nCharter Schools Assoc. v. Los Angeles Unified School District (2015) 60 Cal.4th\n1221, 1237-1238 [declining to adopt plain meaning construction in light of the\nregulatory context]; Simpson Strong-Tie Co., Inc. v. Gore (2010) 49 Cal.4th 12,\n26-27 [rejecting “plain language” construction because it was contrary to the\nLegislature‟s intended purpose].)\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fCal.4th 863, 871.) But, as the majority opinion rightly acknowledges (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 6), the task of interpreting the relevant statutory text plainly includes\nconsideration of the statute‟s structure and the light it sheds on the Legislature‟s\nintended purpose. (Martin v. Wells Fargo Bank (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 489, 494\n[construing statute in light of its text and structure]; see Lungren v. Deukmejian\n(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [“the words must be construed in context, and\nprovisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent\npossible”].)\n       Moreover, our ability to determine whether an apparently plain reading of a\nstatute‟s text produces an absurd result — a question we cannot avoid even if the\nrelevant text of a statutory provision seems clear on its face — depends on some\nengagement with what we take to be the substantive goals the Legislature\nplausibly sought to advance. Thus, although we often say a statute‟s “plain\nmeaning governs” when there is no ambiguity (e.g., Even Zohar Construction &\nRemodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 838), it\nwould be problematic if our use of this formulation were interpreted to mean that\nan examination of a statute‟s context is warranted only when there is ambiguity on\na statute‟s face — and I do not read the majority opinion to so suggest. To the\ncontrary, it recognizes that, along with the text of the statutory provision directly\nat issue, structure and context can be critical in determining whether ambiguity\nexists and in discerning the Legislature‟s intended purpose. (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 6; Horwich, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 276; Manning, What Divides Textualists\nfrom Purposivists? (2006) 106 Colum. L.Rev. 70, 84 [observing that even\ntextualists “recognize that the relevant context for a statutory text includes the\nmischiefs the authors were addressing” given that “speakers use language\npurposively”].)\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f       There is a certain simplicity in the idea that our interpretive task ends if the\nmeaning of a pivotal statutory phrase is “plain.” (E.g., People v. Cornett (2012)\n53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265.) And indeed, giving effect to a statute‟s text and the\nintended purpose it implies is precisely what anchors the court‟s role in a system\nof separated powers. (See Kopp v. Fair Pol. Practices Com. (1995) 11 Cal.4th\n607, 672-673 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) But understanding whether that meaning\nis plain is not a project well served by reading statutory provisions as isolated\nfragments. (Id. at p. 673 [“To seek the meaning of a statute is not simply to look\nup dictionary definitions and then stitch together the results.”]) Instead our task is\nto consider the words of the text as part of a larger statutory project, so we can\nbetter discern not only how to resolve ambiguity but whether ambiguity exists in\nthe first place. (People v. Johnson (2015) 61 Cal.4th 674, 682 [explaining that we\nconstrue a provision‟s words in the context of the statutory scheme to determine\nmeaning and also whether the language is ambiguous].) Which is exactly what the\ncourt has done in this case.\n                                                   CUÉLLAR, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion Poole v.

Code, § 3250 et\nseq.),1 a firefighter has the right to review and respond to any negative comment\nthat is “entered in his or her personnel file, or any other file used for any personnel\npurposes by his or her employer.” (§ 3255.) This case presents the question\nwhether section 3255 gives an employee the right to review and respond to\nnegative comments in a supervisor‟s daily log, consisting of notes that\nmemorialize the supervisor‟s thoughts and observations concerning an employee,\nwhich the supervisor uses as a memory aid in preparing performance plans and\nreviews. We hold that here, because the log was not shared with or available to\nanyone other than the supervisor who wrote the log, it does not constitute a file\n\n\n\n1      References to statutes are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\f“used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer” and section 3255 does\nnot apply.\n                                      I. FACTS\n       Captain Culp, plaintiff Steve Poole‟s supervisor, maintained what he called\na “daily log” regarding each of the employees that he supervised. He created the\nlog using both a computer and handwritten notes. He created a separate file for\neach employee, stored on a flash drive and also in hard copy, which he kept in his\ndesk with the employee‟s name on it. He included in the log “[a]ny factual\noccurrence or occurrences that would aid [him] in writing a thorough and fair\nannual review.” He kept these logs throughout the time he was supervising each\nemployee. Culp would address with the employee behavior recorded in the log\nabout which he had concerns, and if the behavior nevertheless continued it might\nbe mentioned in the performance review.\n       Culp kept the log concerning plaintiff from December of 2008 to July of\n2010. He used the log as a reference in preparing annual reviews and assessments\nof plaintiff‟s performance under a performance improvement plan. The daily log\nprepared by Culp regarding plaintiff included many descriptions of plaintiff‟s\nactivities on the job and his interactions with Culp, noting both positive and\nnegative aspects of plaintiff‟s behavior. Some of the incidents described in the log\nwere included in plaintiff‟s annual performance reviews and his assessments under\na performance improvement plan. For example, the log notes several incidents in\nwhich plaintiff failed to complete his assigned duties in cleaning up the fire\nstation. As also noted in the log, Culp addressed his concerns with plaintiff before\nthe annual evaluation in an attempt to correct plaintiff‟s behavior, and plaintiff‟s\nperformance on cleanup duties was addressed in a performance improvement plan.\nPlaintiff‟s annual performance review indicated that this was an area in which he\nneeded to continue to show improvement.\n\n                                          2\n\f       Many incidents recorded in the log were never included in a review. For\nexample, Culp noted in the log that plaintiff left a training class early one day and\nwent outside to talk on his cell phone. Culp later discussed the incident with\nplaintiff and his log notes indicate that plaintiff explained that he had already\ntaken that class and passed the associated examination. The log also describes a\ntraining session conducted in a stressful environment during which plaintiff\nbecame very anxious. Culp discussed this incident with plaintiff and offered him\nadditional training. Neither of these incidents was mentioned in plaintiff‟s annual\nperformance review.\n       From time to time Culp discussed his concerns about plaintiff‟s\nperformance with Culp‟s own supervisor, Battalion Chief Phillips, Office Chief\nCamargo, human resources personnel, and attorneys for the Orange County Fire\nAuthority, relating some of the incidents recorded in his daily log. But he did not\nshare the log itself with them and he did not allow other employees to review the\ndaily log.\n       Plaintiff had the opportunity to review all of his performance evaluations,\nwhich he understood were then placed in his personnel file at headquarters. When\nhe went to the human resources department at headquarters and asked to see his\npersonnel file he was allowed to review it and make copies of his performance\nevaluations. Plaintiff showed a copy of his performance evaluation to a union\nrepresentative, Bob James. The level of documentation in the review caused\nJames to wonder whether Culp may have been maintaining a file on plaintiff at the\nstationhouse. James demanded that Culp provide him with a copy of plaintiff‟s\n“station file,” and Culp gave him a copy of his daily log regarding plaintiff.\n       Shortly thereafter, plaintiff wrote to the director of human resources of the\nOrange County Fire Authority, asserting that the inclusion of negative comments\nin Culp‟s daily log without providing plaintiff an opportunity to review those\n\n                                          3\n\fcomments violated Government Code section 3255. He requested that all negative\ncomments be removed from the log and that all “personnel files” be made\navailable for his inspection. In response, the fire authority denied his request,\nasserting that section 3255 did not apply to Captain Culp‟s “supervisory notes.”\n       Plaintiff and the Orange County Professional Firefighters Association filed\na petition and complaint in the superior court, seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, damages, civil penalties, and a writ of mandate directing defendants to\ncomply with section 3255 before including adverse comments in plaintiff‟s\npersonnel files. After a trial based on the papers (including transcripts of\ndepositions of both plaintiff and Culp), the trial court denied relief, concluding that\nCulp‟s daily log was not subject to section 3255. The trial court observed, “If\nCulp made a negative note about [plaintiff] in his notes, but did not address it in\nthe yearly evaluation, it does not exist, at least for personnel purposes.”\n       The Court of Appeal reversed. It reasoned that the daily log constituted a\n“file used for . . . personnel purposes” (§ 3255) because a substandard\nperformance evaluation was based on adverse comments contained in the daily log\nand because Culp orally revealed some of the contents of the daily log to his\nbattalion chief. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that section 3255\nrequired that plaintiff be given an opportunity to respond to the negative\ncomments in the log before they were “made known to the employer.” We\ngranted review.\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n       Because this appeal involves the application of a statute to undisputed facts,\nour review is de novo. (See Southern California Edison Co. v. State Board of\nEqualization (1972) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1352787\"><a href=\"/opinion/1352787/southern-california-edison-v-st-bd-of-equalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659.)\n       The Firefighters Procedural Bill of Rights Act (the Act) provides\nfirefighters with certain rights concerning their employment. (§ 3250 et seq.) At\n\n                                           4\n\fissue here is section 3255, which provides that “[a] firefighter shall not have any\ncomment adverse to his or her interest entered in his or her personnel file, or any\nother file used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer, without the\nfirefighter having first read and signed the instrument containing the adverse\ncomment indicating he or she is aware of the comment.” (§ 3255.) The firefighter\nhas 30 days to respond, in writing, to an adverse comment, and “[t]he written\nresponse shall be attached to, and shall accompany, the adverse comment.”\n(§ 3256.)\n       Captain Culp, the author of the daily log, was the only person who had\naccess to it. He discussed some of the incidents described within it with his\nsuperiors and with human resources personnel, but it is undisputed that he did not\npermit them to review the log itself. To the extent Culp used any of the adverse\ncomments contained in the log in any review or assessment of plaintiff‟s\nperformance, those comments were shared with plaintiff in accordance with\nsection 3255. The question presented under these undisputed facts is whether\nnegative comments contained in a document memorializing a supervisor‟s own\nthoughts and observations that is not itself made available to or shared with\nanyone else comes within section 3255. As explained below, we conclude that\nany negative comments contained in the log that were not included in a\nperformance review or performance improvement plan concerning plaintiff were\nnot entered in a file “used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer.”\n(§ 3255.)\n       The Act does not define the phrase “used for any personnel purposes by his\nor her employer.” In discerning the scope and meaning of section 3255, “ „[w]e\nbegin with the plain language of the statute, affording the words of the provision\ntheir ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context,\nbecause the language employed in the Legislature‟s enactment generally is the\n\n                                          5\n\fmost reliable indicator of legislative intent.‟ [Citations.] The plain meaning\ncontrols if there is no ambiguity in the statutory language.” (People v. Cornett\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265.) In interpreting a statutory provision, “our task is to\nselect the construction that comports most closely with the Legislature‟s apparent\nintent, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes‟ general\npurpose, and to avoid a construction that would lead to unreasonable, impractical,\nor arbitrary results.” (Copley Press, Inc. v.

Reading the statutory language in context convinces us that\nthe Legislature did not intend section 3255 to be read so broadly.\n       Section 3255 is one of three neighboring provisions of the Act that concern\nthe rights of firefighters with respect to their personnel files. Section 3255\nrequires the employer to inform the firefighter of any comment adverse to his or\nher interest in a personnel file or any other file used by the employer for personnel\npurposes. Section 3256 entitles a firefighter to respond in writing to any adverse\ncomment “entered in his or her personnel file” and the response “shall be attached\nto, and shall accompany, the adverse comment.” Section 3256.5 entitles a\n\n                                          6\n\ffirefighter to inspect “personnel files that are used or have been used to determine\nthat firefighter‟s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional\ncompensation, or termination or other disciplinary action.” (§ 3256.5, subd. (a).)\nIf, after reviewing the file, “the firefighter believes that any portion of the material\nis mistakenly or unlawfully placed in the file, the firefighter may request, in\nwriting, that the mistaken or unlawful portion be corrected or deleted.” (§ 3256.5\nsubd. (c).) The employer must respond to the request in writing, and both the\nrequest and the response become part of the personnel file. (§ 3256.5, subds. (c),\n(d).)\n        As subdivision (a) of section 3256.5 makes clear, the Legislature was not\nconcerned with any and all files that might in some sense be connected with\npersonnel matters; the Legislature was, rather, specifically concerned with\n“personnel files that are used or have been used to determine th[e] firefighter‟s\nqualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation, or\ntermination or other disciplinary action.” It is true that the other provisions use\nslightly different formulations to refer to the covered “files.” But it is reasonable\nto interpret the three provisions in parallel, given that they appear to operate in\nparallel, and in the service of the same general goal — “to facilitate the officer‟s\nability to respond to adverse comments potentially affecting the officer‟s\nemployment status.” (McMahon, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1332 [describing\nthe nearly identical provisions of the statutes applicable to public safety\nofficers].)2\n\n2      Section 3255 is virtually identical to a statute applicable to public safety\nofficers (§ 3305), and it establishes rights regarding adverse comments that are\nvery similar to those that have been granted to teachers. (Ed. Code, § 44031,\nsubd. (d)(1).) Consequently, cases interpreting those statutes are relevant to our\ninterpretation of section 3255.\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f        As we have observed, an employee‟s “personnel file serves as a permanent\nrecord of his employment; derogatory information placed in that record may be\nused against the employee long after the informant becomes unavailable. Thus the\nstatute provides the employee with the concurrent right to place on the record\nmaterial in rebuttal.” (Miller v. Chico Unified School Dist. (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187649\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187649/miller-v-chico-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n713 (Miller).) Section 3256 requires that the employee‟s response to adverse\ncomments “shall be attached to, and shall accompany, the adverse comment.”\n(§ 3256.) Similarly, section 3256.6 permits the firefighter to request that any\nmaterial in the personnel file that is unlawfully placed there or mistaken be\nremoved or corrected, and both the request and any response by the employer\n“become part of the personnel file.” (§ 3256.5, subds. (c), (d).) These statutes\nensure that the employee‟s response is made part of the written record, so that any\nindividual who accesses that record will have access to the employee‟s response as\nwell as to the adverse comment. Thus, the Legislature appears to have included\nthe phrase “any other file used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer”\nin section 3255 to ensure that employers will not be able to evade the statute‟s\nprotections by basing personnel decisions on materials contained in files that are\nnot designated as the agency‟s official personnel files. Thus, read in context, the\nphrase should be interpreted to encompass any written or computerized record\nthat, although not designated a personnel file, can be used for the same purposes as\na file of the sort described in section 3256.5 — as a record that may be used by the\nemployer to make decisions about promotion, discipline, compensation, and the\nlike.\n        A supervisor‟s log that is used solely to help its creator remember past\nevents does not fall within the scope of that definition. Even if a supervisor uses\nhis or her notes to help draft performance evaluations and other documents that\nultimately are placed in a personnel file, the notes themselves are not a file\n\n                                          8\n\fpreserved by the employer for use in making decisions about the firefighter‟s\nemployment status. Here, Culp was not plaintiff‟s employer. Plaintiff does not\ncontend, and nothing in the record demonstrates, that Culp himself had the\nauthority to take adverse disciplinary actions, such as demotions or discharge,\nagainst plaintiff on behalf of his employer, the Orange County Fire Authority.\nCulp‟s comments thus could adversely affect plaintiff only if and when they were\nplaced in a personnel file or in some other form to which the employer — that is,\nthose who had the authority to discipline plaintiff — had access.\n       Cases applying similar statutes are consistent with this conclusion. They\nhave held that a document containing adverse comments may come within the\ndisclosure requirement even if not formally entered into the official personnel file,\nif the document was either (1) maintained in such a manner that it would be\navailable to those making personnel decisions in the future, or (2) was actually\nused by the employer in making a personnel decision, or both. For example, in\nMiller, supra, 24 Cal.3d at page 707, applying Education Code section 44031, we\nheld that Miller, a school principal, must be permitted to review and respond to\n“derogatory written material compiled and maintained by a school district even\nthough the material has not been properly placed in his personnel file” because\nthat material had been used by the school board in its decision to transfer Miller to\na teaching position. Miller‟s supervisor used his “ „personal notes and calendar‟ ”\nto dictate a summary of “ „meetings, contacts, occurrences, and events‟ ” (Miller,\nat p. 711) involving Miller, which were transcribed in the form of 20 memoranda\nthat were submitted to the school board for its use in deciding whether to reassign\nthe plaintiff from a position as principal to a teaching position. (Miller, supra, at\np. 714.) “[T]he board received [these] confidential memoranda without first\nallowing plaintiff the opportunity to correct any inaccurate derogatory information\ncontained therein.” (Ibid.) We rejected the school board‟s argument that these\n\n                                          9\n\fmemoranda were never “ „entered or filed‟ ” in plaintiff‟s personnel file, stating\nthat an employer “may not avoid the requirements of the statute by maintaining a\n„personnel file‟ for certain documents relating to an employee, segregating\nelsewhere under a different label materials which may serve as a basis for\naffecting the status of the employee‟s employment.” (Id. at pp. 712-713.)\n       In County of Riverside v. Superior Court (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639300\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639300/county-of-riverside-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we held\nthat the county was required to disclose to a police officer who had been\nprovisionally hired, and then fired, derogatory material in a file containing the\nresults of a background investigation the county undertook to determine whether\nto continue to employ him. The investigatory file was actually used in the\ndecision to fire the officer, and it would also be available in the future “to every\nlaw enforcement agency to which [the fired officer] applies.” (Id. at p. 803.) “We\nthink it would elevate form over substance and also permit an end run around the\nBill of Rights Act were we to hold that a law enforcement agency could avoid the\nAct simply by first terminating the employee and then placing its adverse\ncomments in the employee‟s personnel file.” (Ibid.)\n       Similarly, cases from the courts of appeal have concluded that disclosure\nrequirements apply to adverse comments about a police officer even though they\nwere not entered into the officer‟s official personnel file, and even though they had\nnot been used in making any personnel decision, when those files might be\navailable to persons making personnel decisions in the future. In Sacramento\nPolice Officers Assn. v. Venegas (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Venegas), the\nappellate court concluded that an index card maintained in the name of a police\nofficer by the internal affairs department, which listed all complaints that had been\nmade against him, was a file “ „used for . . . personnel purposes‟ ” because it\nwould be available to those responsible for disciplinary action. “The Legislature\nappears to have been concerned with the potential unfairness that may result from\n\n                                          10\n\fan adverse comment that is not accompanied by punitive action and, thus, will\nescape the procedural protections available during administrative review of a\npunitive action.” (Id. at p. 926.) The court observed that “internal affairs\npersonnel could be influenced to a peace officer employee‟s detriment in a future\ninvestigation if the officer‟s internal affairs file or index card contains an\nunexplained or unrebutted adverse comment.” (Id. at p. 929.) Furthermore,\nmanagement of the officer‟s employing agency had access to these cards and,\nalthough complaints that had been found to be frivolous, unfounded, or exonerated\ncould not be used for punishment or promotional purposes, they could be used to\nrequire counseling or additional training. (Ibid.; see Pen. Code, § 832.5,\nsubd. (c)(2), (3); Gov. Code, § 3304, subd. (g).)\n       Likewise, in Aguilar v. Johnson (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2137829\"><a href=\"/opinion/2137829/aguilar-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The court rejected the contention that uninvestigated\ncomplaints such as this one were not considered in making personnel decisions,\nconcluding that “[t]heir placement in an officer‟s personnel file could potentially\nlead to not only adverse personnel decisions but could also result in a more severe\npenalty being imposed in a subsequent disciplinary proceeding. Because of this\npotential adverse impact on the officer, the complaint is an „adverse comment‟\nwithin the meaning of these sections.” (Id. at pp. 249-250; see Seligsohn v. Day\n(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2259463\"><a href=\"/opinion/2259463/seligsohn-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In contrast, McMahon, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2288113\"><a href=\"/opinion/2288113/mcmahon-v-city-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The log was available to no\none other than Culp himself. Many of the potentially negative comments\ncontained in the log were never included in any document made available to\nplaintiff‟s employer, because Culp either deemed the incidents inconsequential or\nresolved them in plaintiff‟s favor. And it is undisputed that the documents Culp\nprepared with the assistance of the log — plaintiff‟s performance evaluations and\nimprovement plan — were disclosed to plaintiff before they were entered into his\npersonnel file.\n       In concluding that section 3255 applied to Culp‟s log, the Court of Appeal\nfound this case to be analogous to Miller, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187649\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187649/miller-v-chico-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Miller, however,\nis not comparable. There was no contention in Miller that the supervisor‟s\n“ „personal notes and calendar‟ ” should have been disclosed to Miller. Rather, the\nstatute was triggered when Miller‟s supervisor transmitted the memoranda he\nprepared with the assistance of those notes to the school board for its use in\nmaking a decision about Miller‟s employment status. Likewise, in the present\ncase, the statute was triggered when the performance evaluation was entered into\nplaintiff‟s personnel file. Miller does not suggest an earlier triggering date.\n       We are not persuaded to the contrary by the Court of Appeal‟s reasoning.\nThe Court of Appeal asserted that “[l]ike the situation in Miller, information not\ncontained in [plaintiff‟s] main personnel file was presented to his employer prior\nto an adverse employment action by the employer. As in Miller, revealing the\ncontents of the daily logs to Battalion Chief Philips denied Poole the opportunity\n\n                                          12\n\fto respond to the adverse comments made known to the employer, contrary to the\nintent of the protective statutory enactment.” This case is distinguishable from\nMiller. It is undisputed that Culp did not share his log with anyone; he merely\ndiscussed with others some of the incidents that he had observed and also recorded\nin his log, preliminary to completing plaintiff‟s evaluations and performance\nimprovement plan. Nothing in the Act attempts to regulate a supervisor‟s\npreliminary verbal consultations with his superiors or human resources personnel\nprior to completing an evaluation. The statute plainly gives firefighters the right to\nreview and file a written response to certain documents. Its language cannot be\nstretched to include a right to file a written response to verbal communications.\n       The Court of Appeal expressed concern that denying the employee access\nto the supervisor‟s daily log would frustrate the Act‟s purpose of “providing\nfirefighters a right to meaningfully respond to adverse comments that may affect\npersonnel decisions concerning the firefighter.” It reasoned that although Culp\ncould use the notes to help him remember events that he included in annual\npersonnel evaluations, plaintiff could not be expected to remember the details of\nthese events “months and months later when he was finally made aware of the\nadverse comments in the course of a yearly performance review” and his ability to\ncorrect inaccurate or incomplete statements in the review would be impeded.\n       The problem identified by the Court of Appeal would exist to some degree\nregardless of whether a supervisor kept notes or simply relied on an excellent\nmemory. If performance reviews occur only annually, an employee may have a\ndifferent recollection from his or her supervisor of events occurring many months\nearlier, or may not recall those events at all. Unreasonable delay in informing an\nemployee about incidents that could affect his or her employment status might\nsometimes be prejudicial to the employee‟s ability to rebut an employer‟s\ncharacterization of the employee‟s conduct, but prejudice resulting from such\n\n                                         13\n\fdelay is not the issue that is addressed in section 3255. The only timing\nrequirement in section 3255 is the requirement that the employee have the\nopportunity to review the adverse comment before it is actually entered into the\nfile. There is a provision in the Act that addresses delay, in the context of\nallegations of misconduct. (§ 3254.) Generally, no punitive action may be taken\non an allegation of misconduct unless the investigation of the allegation is\ncompleted and the employee is notified of the proposed disciplinary action within\none year. (§ 3254, subd. (d).) Plaintiff, however, does not allege that section 3254\nwas violated or that there was any unreasonable delay in informing him of\nincidents that might cause him to receive a negative evaluation.\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n       The decision of the Court of Appeal is reversed.\n                                                        CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

The foundation for the court‟s opinion is its interpretation of the\nFirefighters Procedural Bill of Rights Act (Gov. Code, § 3250 et seq.), and the\nlogic of that interpretation is unassailable. I nonetheless write separately to\nunderscore an important principle about the interpretive responsibilities that are so\noften at the heart of what we do. The bottom line is this: however important it is\nto train our attention on the plain meaning of a statutory provision we are\nconstruing, we must read that provision as we do here — in its larger context —\nwhen deciding whether its meaning is plain.\n       Suppose a statute is enacted with provisions similar to the ones at issue in\nthis case. “Any public employee,” the statute provides, “has a right to review\npersonnel files that are used or have been used to determine the employee‟s\nqualifications for employment, promotion, or discipline.” The question later arises\nwhether a supervisor‟s hastily scrawled note on a napkin about a subordinate‟s\nperformance — subsequently placed in a file folder, and then digitally copied onto\na smartphone — constitutes a “personnel file,” and whether the supervisor‟s\noccasional glance at the napkin or the digital file before writing a more formal\nevaluation constitutes “use[] to determine the employee‟s qualifications for\nemployment, promotion, or discipline.” That the ordinary usage and dictionary\n                                          1\n\fdefinitions of terms like “file,” “use,” and “determine” would matter in answering\nthese questions is beyond question. (E.g., Ceja v. Rudolph & Sletten, Inc. (2013)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1121 [using ordinary usage and dictionary definitions to construe\n“good faith”].)\n       What would be difficult to defend, however, is the proposition that the\ninquiry should end without considering what the rest of the statute tells us about\nthe meaning of the phrase at issue. Does a separate statutory provision imply that\n“personnel file” is to be construed broadly or narrowly? Are electronic records\naddressed elsewhere in the statute? If a phrase like “used to determine the\nemployee‟s qualifications” is not explicitly defined in the statute, do other\nprovisions illuminate anything relevant about how the statutory scheme\nunderstands the limits of the procedural protections it affords?\n       The devil, in short, is in the details. And the details are elucidated by\ncontext — the statutory structure and the words of surrounding or related\nprovisions. The statute‟s structure and its surrounding provisions can reveal the\nsemantic relationships that give more precise meaning to the specific text being\ninterpreted, even if the text may have initially appeared to be unambiguous. 1\n\n1       In Apple Inc. v.

But, as the majority opinion rightly acknowledges (maj. opn.,\nante, at p. 6), the task of interpreting the relevant statutory text plainly includes\nconsideration of the statute‟s structure and the light it sheds on the Legislature‟s\nintended purpose. (Martin v. Wells Fargo Bank (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494\n[construing statute in light of its text and structure]; see Lungren v.

Thus, although we often say a statute‟s “plain\nmeaning governs” when there is no ambiguity (e.g., Even Zohar Construction &\nRemodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838), it\nwould be problematic if our use of this formulation were interpreted to mean that\nan examination of a statute‟s context is warranted only when there is ambiguity on\na statute‟s face — and I do not read the majority opinion to so suggest. To the\ncontrary, it recognizes that, along with the text of the statutory provision directly\nat issue, structure and context can be critical in determining whether ambiguity\nexists and in discerning the Legislature‟s intended purpose. (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 6; Horwich, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 276; Manning, What Divides Textualists\nfrom Purposivists? (2006) 106 Colum. L.Rev. 70, 84 [observing that even\ntextualists “recognize that the relevant context for a statutory text includes the\nmischiefs the authors were addressing” given that “speakers use language\npurposively”].)\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f       There is a certain simplicity in the idea that our interpretive task ends if the\nmeaning of a pivotal statutory phrase is “plain.” (E.g., People v. Cornett (2012)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265.) And indeed, giving effect to a statute‟s text and the\nintended purpose it implies is precisely what anchors the court‟s role in a system\nof separated powers. (See Kopp v. Fair Pol. Practices Com. (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1374964\"><a href=\"/opinion/1374964/kopp-v-fair-pol-practices-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672-673 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) But understanding whether that meaning\nis plain is not a project well served by reading statutory provisions as isolated\nfragments. (Id. at p. 673 [“To seek the meaning of a statute is not simply to look\nup dictionary definitions and then stitch together the results.”]) Instead our task is\nto consider the words of the text as part of a larger statutory project, so we can\nbetter discern not only how to resolve ambiguity but whether ambiguity exists in\nthe first place. (People v. Johnson (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682 [explaining that we\nconstrue a provision‟s words in the context of the statutory scheme to determine\nmeaning and also whether the language is ambiguous].) Which is exactly what the\ncourt has done in this case.\n                                                   CUÉLLAR, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion Poole v.
