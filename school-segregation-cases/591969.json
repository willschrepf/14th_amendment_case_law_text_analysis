BARKER, JUDGE\n\f                                                 OPINION\n\n        The appellant, Jimmy Bowen, appeals as of right his conviction and sentence\n\nfollowing a jury trial in the Criminal Court of Johnson County. The appellant was\n\nindicted by the Johnson County Grand Jury for the knowing possession of contraband,\n\nto wit: marijuana, in a state penal institution where prisoners are quartered, without the\n\nexpress written consent of the institution’s chief administrator, a Class C felony. See\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 39-16-201 (1991 repl.). Following his conviction, the appellant\n\nwas ordered to pay a five thousand ($5,000) dollar fine and serve six years in the\n\nTennessee Department of Correction as a Range I standard offender. 1 The sentence\n\nwas ordered to run consecutive to a seven-year sentence the appellant was then\n\nserving for convictions he received in 1993.\n\n        The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n        The appellant raises five issues in this appeal. He contends that: (1) The trial\n\ncourt improperly denied his motion for a mistrial after the prosecution elicited witness\n\ntestimony concerning the appellant’s invocation of his right to remain silent; (2) The\n\nState failed to prove an essential element of the charged offense concerning the\n\nexpress written consent of the prison’s chief administrator; (3) His conviction and\n\nsentence for the contraband possession, following administrative discipline for the\n\nsame offense, violated double jeopardy; (4) The State arbitrarily selected the appellant\n\nfor prosecution in violation of equal protection; and (5) The trial court erred in ruling\n\nthat the chain of custody over the package marked as exhibit one was sufficient to\n\nallow it into evidence.\n\n                                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n        The appellant was an inmate at the Northeast Correctional Center (NECC) in\n\nJohnson City. On February 19, 1995, he received a visit from his wife in the NECC\n\n        1\n          At the sent enc ing he aring , the tr ial cou rt ack now ledge d tha t the a ppe llant h ad m ultiple\nconvictions dating back to 1967 and should be sentenced as a Range II or III offender. However, the\nState failed to provide proper notice as to those past convictions before the sentencing hearing. The trial\ncourt, therefore, reluctantly sentenced the appellant as a Range I standard offender. That sentencing\nrange is r eflected in the corre cted jud gme nt entere d on Au gust 8, 19 96.\n\n                                                      2\n\fvisiting gallery. During the visit, Sergeant Pat Carper observed the appellant’s wife\n\nreach under her blouse, pull out a small wrapped package, and secretly hand it to the\n\nappellant. Sergeant Carper immediately directed another NECC employee, Officer\n\nDavid Musser, to apprehend the appellant in the gallery and take him to the strip\n\nsearch room. On the way to the search room, Officer Musser observed the appellant\n\nattempt to hand the wrapped package to other inmates before he threw it onto a\n\nvending table. Officer Musser, thereafter, obtained the package and discovered that it\n\ncontained a plant-like material wrapped in black electrical tape. He and Sergeant\n\nCarper delivered the package to internal affairs at the NECC for field testing. 2\n\n        At trial, Lieutenant Randy Lee, an officer with internal affairs at NECC, testified\n\nthat he received the package from Officer Musser and Sergeant Carper. Lee stated\n\nthat after he obtained the package, he sent it directly to the TBI Crime Lab in Knoxville\n\nfor field testing. When the tests were concluded, Lee recovered the package along\n\nwith a report indicating that the plant-like material was 29.8 grams of marijuana.\n\nLee testified that the package, admitted into evidence as exhibit one, matched the\n\npackage he sent to the TBI Lab.\n\n        Celeste White, a chemist for the TBI Crime Lab, testified for the State\n\nconcerning the testing and handling of the marijuana package. White stated that she\n\nreceived the package from Lieutenant Lee on February 27, 1995. Upon receipt at the\n\ncrime lab, the package was given a TBI label containing a lab number, the appellant’s\n\nname, the date received, and White’s initials. The package was then stored in an\n\nevidence vault until the field tests were conducted. White testified that she tested the\n\nplant material and discovered that it was approximately 29.8 grams of marijuana. She\n\nstated that after the tests were concluded, the package was returned to the NECC\n\nalong with a report indicating the test results.\n\n\n        2\n          At trial, the State introduced into evidence a clear plastic bag containing a plant-like material\nand black electrical tape. The bag was admitted and marked as exhibit one. Sergeant Carper testified\nthat the package in exhibit one was similar to the taped object taken from the appellant. Officer Musser\nalso testified and indica ted that ex hibit one wa s identical to th e pack age he took fro m the appellant.\n\n                                                     3\n\f                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       The appellant first contends that he was entitled to a mistrial after the\n\nprosecutor elicited testimony concerning the appellant’s invocation of his right to\n\nremain silent.\n\n       This issue is without merit.\n\n       At trial, Lieutenant Lee testified that he met with the appellant after the package\n\nof marijuana was discovered and read the appellant his Miranda rights. Lee further\n\nindicated that the appellant signed a rights-waiver form. Over the defense counsel’s\n\nobjection, the prosecutor continued a line of questioning in which Lieutenant Lee\n\nultimately stated that, during the preliminary investigation, the appellant “had no\n\nstatement to make whatsoever.”\n\n       Following Lee’s testimony, the defense counsel moved for a mistrial. The trial\n\ncourt denied the defense motion and chose to administer a special jury instruction to\n\nremedy the prosecutor’s error. The trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n       Members of the Jury, the law in this country has been for two hundred\n       years that that you cannot consider someone’s silence against them. In\n       other words, if someone chooses to not make a statement just as if they\n       choose to not testify on their behalf if they’re a defendant in a trial, you\n       can’t consider that for any purpose whatsoever ever, either for them or\n       against them. And, the district attorney should should not have gotten\n       anything about this in the record. It was improper. And so, first, I I must\n       instruct you that you are not to consider whatsoever, certainly you’re not\n       to consider against Mr. Bowen if if you find that that he chose not to talk\n       to the investigator because everybody’s got that right. If an investigator\n       walks up to you and asks you about something and you’re got a right to\n       say, ‘sorry. I don’t want to talk about it. Go prove your case and do it\n       whatever way you want to, but I’m not going to talk to you.’ And, that’s\n       been the law of the land for good reason for hundreds of years.\n\n       After giving the jury instruction, the trial court polled each juror to determine if\n\nhe or she could completely disregard the testimony concerning the appellant’s silence.\n\nOnly one of the twelve jurors expressed difficulty in following the trial court’s\n\ninstruction. The trial judge acknowledged the juror’s hesitancy and took special care\n\nto thoroughly question and instruct the juror. After an extensive open-court interview,\n\neach juror assured the trial court that the testimony concerning the appellant’s silence\n\n\n                                              4\n\fwould be disregarded. The trial court determined that a mistrial was unnecessary.\n\n       The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt and will not be overturned on appeal unless there was an abuse of that\n\ndiscretion. See State v. Seay, 945 S.W.2d 755, 764 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996); State v.\n\nJones, 733 S.W.2d 517, 522 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987). A mistrial is usually\n\nappropriate in a criminal case only where there is a “manifest necessity” to correct\n\ndamage done to the judicial process when some event has occurred which precludes\n\nan impartial verdict. See Arnold v. State, 563 S.W.2d 792, 794 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1977). The burden of demonstrating a “manifest necessity” lies with the appellant.\n\n       In this case, we find that the trial court exercised proper discretion in denying\n\nthe appellant’s motion for a mistrial. Although we agree that the prosecutor acted\n\nimproperly in eliciting testimony concerning the appellant’s silence, we find that the\n\ntrial court’s curative instruction adequately remedied any possible prejudice from the\n\nimproper testimony. The appellant has failed to demonstrate a manifest necessity\n\nsufficient to warrant a mistrial.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       The appellant next contends that the State failed to prove an essential element\n\nof the charged offense, to wit: that the prison’s chief administrator had not given\n\nexpress written consent for the appellant to possess marijuana.\n\n       Although this issue is extremely close, we find it to be without merit.\n\n       The appellant’s argument turns on whether the evidence at trial was sufficient\n\nto sustain his conviction. When an appellant challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nconvicting evidence, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution in determining whether “any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” See Jackson v. Virginia,\n\n443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). We do not reweigh or re-\n\nevaluate the evidence and are required to afford the State the strongest legitimate\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fview of the proof contained in the record as well as all reasonable and legitimate\n\ninferences which may be drawn therefrom. See State v. Cabbage, 571 S.W.2d 832,\n\n835 (Tenn. 1978).\n\n       Questions concerning the credibility of witnesses, the weight and value to be\n\ngiven to the evidence, and any factual issues raised by the evidence are resolved by\n\nthe trier of fact, not this Court. See Cabbage, 571 S.W.2d at 835. A guilty verdict\n\nrendered by the jury and approved by the trial judge accredits the testimony of the\n\nwitnesses for the State, and a presumption of guilt replaces the presumption of\n\ninnocence. See State v. Grace, 493 S.W.2d 474, 476 (Tenn. 1973).\n\n       An appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence has the burden of\n\ndemonstrating to this Court why the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict\n\nreturned by the trier of fact. This Court will not disturb a verdict of guilt for lack of\n\nsufficient evidence unless the facts contained in the record and any inferences which\n\nmay be drawn from the facts are insufficient, as a matter of law, for a rational trier of\n\nfact to find the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Tuggle, 639\n\nS.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982).\n\n       In this case, a jury convicted the appellant of marijuana possession in a state\n\npenal institution without the express written consent of the prison’s chief administrator.\n\nThe applicable statute provides that, “[i]t is unlawful for any person to [k]nowingly\n\npossess any of the materials prohibited in subdivision (a)(1) while present in any penal\n\ninstitution where prisoners are quartered or under custodial supervision without the\n\nexpress written consent of the chief administrator of the institution.” See Tenn. Code\n\nAnn. § 39-16-201(a)(2) (Supp. 1996). Subsection (a)(1) of the statute includes\n\ncontrolled substances in the list of prohibited materials.\n\n       The appellant contends that the convicting evidence was insufficient because\n\nthe State failed to prove that he possessed the marijuana without the express written\n\nconsent of the prison’s chief administrator. Although we acknowledge that direct\n\ntestimony from the NECC warden would have prevented any issue in this regard, we\n\n                                              6\n\ffind that the essential element concerning the lack of express written consent was\n\nsufficiently proved by circumstantial evidence.\n\n         Circumstantial evidence includes collateral facts and circumstances which do\n\nnot directly prove the fact in issue but from which the fact may be logically inferred.\n\nSee State v. Thompson, 519 S.W.2d 789, 792-93 (Tenn. 1975). We find that the\n\nrecord in this case contains several facts and circumstances sufficient to prove that\n\nthe prison’s chief administrator had not given express written consent to the\n\nappellant’s possession of marijuana.\n\n         First, the record reflects that the appellant’s wife surreptitiously handed the\n\nappellant a package tightly wrapped and concealed in black electrical tape. When\n\nNECC prison guards acted to apprehend the appellant and obtain the hidden\n\npackage, the appellant tried to discard the package by passing it off to other prison\n\ninmates. The actions of the appellant and his wife in attempting to smuggle the\n\npackage into the NECC are clearly inconsistent with the notion that the appellant had\n\nexpress written consent to possess marijuana. From that evidence, a reasonable\n\nperson could conclude that the appellant did not have the warden’s express written\n\nconsent to possess the package of marijuana. See State v. Jimmy Cullop, Jr., No.\n\n03C01-9607-CR-00281 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Knoxville, March 18, 1997).\n\n         Moreover, at the time of the appellant’s offense, marijuana was a Schedule II\n\ncontrolled substance which had no legal use in the State of Tennessee. See Tenn.\n\nCode Ann. § 39-17-408 (6)(A) (1991 repl.). 3 It is almost inconceivable that a prison\n\nadministrator would give permission for an inmate to possess a totally illegal\n\nsubstance in prison. We, therefore, conclude that the jury was justified in finding\n\n         3\n          The T ennes see C ode co ntinues to treat m arijuana a s a Sch edule II co ntrolled su bstanc e. See\nTen n.

See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-407 (1997). Tennessee Code\nAnnotated section 39-17-408 (6)(A) treats marijuana as a Schedule II controlled substance “only for the\npurposes enumerated in the Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act, compiled in title 68,\ncha pter 5 2\" of th e Te nne sse e Co de.

Code A nn. §§ 68 -52-101 -- 107 (rep ealed 19 92).\n\n                                                         7\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant possessed contraband in a state penal\n\ninstitution without the express written consent of the prison’s chief administrator.\n\n                                                            III.\n\n         The appellant next contends that his conviction and sentence for the\n\npossession of contraband in the State penal institution violated double jeopardy. He\n\nargues that the administrative discipline he received from the Tennessee Department\n\nof Correction, prior to trial, precluded the State from prosecuting him thereafter for the\n\nsame offense.\n\n         This issue is without merit.\n\n         Following the discovery of marijuana in the appellant’s possession, the\n\nappellant received administrative discipline by prison authorities at the Tennessee\n\nDepartment of Correction (“TDOC”). 4 The appellant relies on the decision in United\n\nStates v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892 (1989) to assert that his prosecution\n\nand conviction for the possession of contraband, following administrative discipline for\n\nthe same offense, placed him in double jeopardy.\n\n         The appellant’s reliance on Halper is misplaced. In Halper, the United States\n\nSupreme Court addressed whether the imposition of a $130,000 civil penalty for\n\nMedicare fraud, following a criminal conviction for the same offense, violated double\n\njeopardy. See 109 S.Ct. at 1896. The respondent in Halper had been convicted in\n\ncriminal proceedings before the Government filed a civil suit against him for the same\n\noffense. See id. The Court held that a $130,000 liability in the civil suit constituted a\n\nsecond punishment because the penalty amount was disproportionate to the actual\n\nharm caused by the respondent’s actions. See id. at 1904. The Court, therefore, held\n\n\n\n         4\n           The record contains evidence from a pre-trial hearing in which the appellant’s counsel argued\nthat th e app ellant ’s upc om ing tria l was selec tive pr ose cutio n in vio lation of eq ual pr otec tion a nd do uble\njeopardy. At that hearing, Lieutenant Randy Lee testified that the appellant received three days of\nsegregated confinement as administrative discipline for the marijuana possession. Lieutenant Lee\nfurther tes tified that adm inistrative disc ipline at the N ECC is impo sed by a T DOC Disciplinary B oard.\nAccor ding to Lieu tenant Le e, the Disc iplinary Board never ad ds an a dditional se ntence or jail time to\nwhat the inmate is currently serving. Instead, disciplinary measures include warnings, restrictions of\nprivileges, a ssignm ents of e xtra work duty, and se gregate d confin eme nt.\n\n                                                            8\n\fthat the civil penalty violated double jeopardy.\n\n         The Supreme Court’s decision in Halper is not applicable to the facts in the\n\nappellant’s case. Unlike the respondent in Halper, the appellant was not subjected to\n\nliability in two separate judicial proceedings. To the contrary, the appellant was merely\n\ndisciplined by administrative authorities at the TDOC before his trial in the criminal\n\ncourt.\n\n         It is well settled in Tennessee that administrative proceedings by state prison\n\nauthorities do not place defendants in “jeopardy” within the meaning of the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause. See Turner v. Gore, 175 S.W.2d 317, 319 (Tenn. 1943); Ray v.\n\nState, 577 S.W.2d 681, 682 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978); Terry Davis v. State, No.\n\n03C01-9610-CR-00358 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Knoxville, June 12, 1997). Therefore,\n\nwe conclude that the administrative discipline in this case did not preclude the State\n\nfrom prosecuting the appellant for the same offense.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n         The appellant next contends that the State arbitrarily selected him for\n\nprosecution in violation of his equal protection rights. The appellant argues that the\n\nNECC warden arbitrarily determines which cases are referred to the district attorney\n\nfor prosecution.\n\n         This issue is without merit.\n\n         The law in Tennessee is well settled that state officials enjoy broad discretion in\n\ndetermining what cases are selected for prosecution. See Cooper v. State, 847\n\nS.W.2d 521, 536 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992); Yearwood v. State, 455 S.W.2d 612, 617\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1970). That discretion does not violate the principles of equal\n\nprotection unless the choice to prosecute is “deliberately based upon an unjustifiable\n\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.” See Oyler v. Boles,\n\n368 U.S. 448, 456 (1962).\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       In this case, the record is devoid of any evidence demonstrating that the\n\nwarden at the NECC arbitrarily selects cases to be referred for prosecution. To the\n\ncontrary, at a pre-trial hearing, Warden Howard Carlton of the NECC testified that he\n\nconsiders specific factors before deciding whether to refer a case to the district\n\nattorney. Warden Carlton stated that he considers whether the case involves a felony\n\nand whether there are sufficient facts for the district attorney to present in criminal\n\nproceedings. Warden Carlton further stated that criteria such as an inmate’s race,\n\nreligion, or ethnic origin is never considered.\n\n       We find that the discretion exercised by the NECC warden does not violate the\n\nprinciples of equal protection. The appellant’s claim that his prosecution violated the\n\nEqual Protection Clause is without merit.\n\n                                            V.\n\n       The appellant next contends that the chain of custody over the package\n\nmarked as exhibit one was insufficient to allow it into evidence.\n\n       This issue is without merit.\n\n       During the direct examination of Sergeant Carper, the prosecution introduced a\n\nclear plastic bag, marked as exhibit one, containing a plant-like material with black\n\nelectrical tape. The record reflects that the appellant failed to object to the admission\n\nof the plastic bag at trial. Therefore, in this appeal, the appellant has waived any\n\nchallenge to the admission of the package into evidence.\n\n       Moreover, even if the issue were properly preserved for appeal, we find that the\n\nState established legally sufficient chain of custody over the testing and handling of\n\nthe package. We conclude that the trial court exercised proper discretion in allowing\n\nthe package into evidence.\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                                   ____________________________\n                                   WILLIAM M.

BARKER, JUDGE\n\f                                                 OPINION\n\n        The appellant, Jimmy Bowen, appeals as of right his conviction and sentence\n\nfollowing a jury trial in the Criminal Court of Johnson County. The appellant was\n\nindicted by the Johnson County Grand Jury for the knowing possession of contraband,\n\nto wit: marijuana, in a state penal institution where prisoners are quartered, without the\n\nexpress written consent of the institution’s chief administrator, a Class C felony. See\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 39-16-201 (1991 repl.). Following his conviction, the appellant\n\nwas ordered to pay a five thousand ($5,000) dollar fine and serve six years in the\n\nTennessee Department of Correction as a Range I standard offender. 1 The sentence\n\nwas ordered to run consecutive to a seven-year sentence the appellant was then\n\nserving for convictions he received in 1993.\n\n        The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n        The appellant raises five issues in this appeal. He contends that: (1) The trial\n\ncourt improperly denied his motion for a mistrial after the prosecution elicited witness\n\ntestimony concerning the appellant’s invocation of his right to remain silent; (2) The\n\nState failed to prove an essential element of the charged offense concerning the\n\nexpress written consent of the prison’s chief administrator; (3) His conviction and\n\nsentence for the contraband possession, following administrative discipline for the\n\nsame offense, violated double jeopardy; (4) The State arbitrarily selected the appellant\n\nfor prosecution in violation of equal protection; and (5) The trial court erred in ruling\n\nthat the chain of custody over the package marked as exhibit one was sufficient to\n\nallow it into evidence.\n\n                                    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n        The appellant was an inmate at the Northeast Correctional Center (NECC) in\n\nJohnson City. On February 19, 1995, he received a visit from his wife in the NECC\n\n        1\n          At the sent enc ing he aring , the tr ial cou rt ack now ledge d tha t the a ppe llant h ad m ultiple\nconvictions dating back to 1967 and should be sentenced as a Range II or III offender. However, the\nState failed to provide proper notice as to those past convictions before the sentencing hearing. The trial\ncourt, therefore, reluctantly sentenced the appellant as a Range I standard offender. That sentencing\nrange is r eflected in the corre cted jud gme nt entere d on Au gust 8, 19 96.\n\n                                                      2\n\fvisiting gallery. During the visit, Sergeant Pat Carper observed the appellant’s wife\n\nreach under her blouse, pull out a small wrapped package, and secretly hand it to the\n\nappellant. Sergeant Carper immediately directed another NECC employee, Officer\n\nDavid Musser, to apprehend the appellant in the gallery and take him to the strip\n\nsearch room. On the way to the search room, Officer Musser observed the appellant\n\nattempt to hand the wrapped package to other inmates before he threw it onto a\n\nvending table. Officer Musser, thereafter, obtained the package and discovered that it\n\ncontained a plant-like material wrapped in black electrical tape. He and Sergeant\n\nCarper delivered the package to internal affairs at the NECC for field testing. 2\n\n        At trial, Lieutenant Randy Lee, an officer with internal affairs at NECC, testified\n\nthat he received the package from Officer Musser and Sergeant Carper. Lee stated\n\nthat after he obtained the package, he sent it directly to the TBI Crime Lab in Knoxville\n\nfor field testing. When the tests were concluded, Lee recovered the package along\n\nwith a report indicating that the plant-like material was 29.8 grams of marijuana.\n\nLee testified that the package, admitted into evidence as exhibit one, matched the\n\npackage he sent to the TBI Lab.\n\n        Celeste White, a chemist for the TBI Crime Lab, testified for the State\n\nconcerning the testing and handling of the marijuana package. White stated that she\n\nreceived the package from Lieutenant Lee on February 27, 1995. Upon receipt at the\n\ncrime lab, the package was given a TBI label containing a lab number, the appellant’s\n\nname, the date received, and White’s initials. The package was then stored in an\n\nevidence vault until the field tests were conducted. White testified that she tested the\n\nplant material and discovered that it was approximately 29.8 grams of marijuana. She\n\nstated that after the tests were concluded, the package was returned to the NECC\n\nalong with a report indicating the test results.\n\n\n        2\n          At trial, the State introduced into evidence a clear plastic bag containing a plant-like material\nand black electrical tape. The bag was admitted and marked as exhibit one. Sergeant Carper testified\nthat the package in exhibit one was similar to the taped object taken from the appellant. Officer Musser\nalso testified and indica ted that ex hibit one wa s identical to th e pack age he took fro m the appellant.\n\n                                                     3\n\f                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       The appellant first contends that he was entitled to a mistrial after the\n\nprosecutor elicited testimony concerning the appellant’s invocation of his right to\n\nremain silent.\n\n       This issue is without merit.\n\n       At trial, Lieutenant Lee testified that he met with the appellant after the package\n\nof marijuana was discovered and read the appellant his Miranda rights. Lee further\n\nindicated that the appellant signed a rights-waiver form. Over the defense counsel’s\n\nobjection, the prosecutor continued a line of questioning in which Lieutenant Lee\n\nultimately stated that, during the preliminary investigation, the appellant “had no\n\nstatement to make whatsoever.”\n\n       Following Lee’s testimony, the defense counsel moved for a mistrial. The trial\n\ncourt denied the defense motion and chose to administer a special jury instruction to\n\nremedy the prosecutor’s error. The trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n       Members of the Jury, the law in this country has been for two hundred\n       years that that you cannot consider someone’s silence against them. In\n       other words, if someone chooses to not make a statement just as if they\n       choose to not testify on their behalf if they’re a defendant in a trial, you\n       can’t consider that for any purpose whatsoever ever, either for them or\n       against them. And, the district attorney should should not have gotten\n       anything about this in the record. It was improper. And so, first, I I must\n       instruct you that you are not to consider whatsoever, certainly you’re not\n       to consider against Mr. Bowen if if you find that that he chose not to talk\n       to the investigator because everybody’s got that right. If an investigator\n       walks up to you and asks you about something and you’re got a right to\n       say, ‘sorry. I don’t want to talk about it. Go prove your case and do it\n       whatever way you want to, but I’m not going to talk to you.’ And, that’s\n       been the law of the land for good reason for hundreds of years.\n\n       After giving the jury instruction, the trial court polled each juror to determine if\n\nhe or she could completely disregard the testimony concerning the appellant’s silence.\n\nOnly one of the twelve jurors expressed difficulty in following the trial court’s\n\ninstruction. The trial judge acknowledged the juror’s hesitancy and took special care\n\nto thoroughly question and instruct the juror. After an extensive open-court interview,\n\neach juror assured the trial court that the testimony concerning the appellant’s silence\n\n\n                                              4\n\fwould be disregarded. The trial court determined that a mistrial was unnecessary.\n\n       The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt and will not be overturned on appeal unless there was an abuse of that\n\ndiscretion.

Seay, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427542\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427542/state-v-seay/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (Tenn.

Crim. App. 1987). A mistrial is usually\n\nappropriate in a criminal case only where there is a “manifest necessity” to correct\n\ndamage done to the judicial process when some event has occurred which precludes\n\nan impartial verdict. See Arnold v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462368\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462368/arnold-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1977). The burden of demonstrating a “manifest necessity” lies with the appellant.\n\n       In this case, we find that the trial court exercised proper discretion in denying\n\nthe appellant’s motion for a mistrial. Although we agree that the prosecutor acted\n\nimproperly in eliciting testimony concerning the appellant’s silence, we find that the\n\ntrial court’s curative instruction adequately remedied any possible prejudice from the\n\nimproper testimony. The appellant has failed to demonstrate a manifest necessity\n\nsufficient to warrant a mistrial.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       The appellant next contends that the State failed to prove an essential element\n\nof the charged offense, to wit: that the prison’s chief administrator had not given\n\nexpress written consent for the appellant to possess marijuana.\n\n       Although this issue is extremely close, we find it to be without merit.\n\n       The appellant’s argument turns on whether the evidence at trial was sufficient\n\nto sustain his conviction. When an appellant challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nconvicting evidence, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution in determining whether “any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” See Jackson v. Virginia,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We do not reweigh or re-\n\nevaluate the evidence and are required to afford the State the strongest legitimate\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fview of the proof contained in the record as well as all reasonable and legitimate\n\ninferences which may be drawn therefrom. See State v.

See Cabbage, 571 S.W.2d at 835. A guilty verdict\n\nrendered by the jury and approved by the trial judge accredits the testimony of the\n\nwitnesses for the State, and a presumption of guilt replaces the presumption of\n\ninnocence. See State v. Grace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456081\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456081/state-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 476 (Tenn. 1973).\n\n       An appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence has the burden of\n\ndemonstrating to this Court why the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict\n\nreturned by the trier of fact. This Court will not disturb a verdict of guilt for lack of\n\nsufficient evidence unless the facts contained in the record and any inferences which\n\nmay be drawn from the facts are insufficient, as a matter of law, for a rational trier of\n\nfact to find the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Tuggle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518420\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518420/state-v-tuggle/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 914 (Tenn. 1982).\n\n       In this case, a jury convicted the appellant of marijuana possession in a state\n\npenal institution without the express written consent of the prison’s chief administrator.\n\nThe applicable statute provides that, “[i]t is unlawful for any person to [k]nowingly\n\npossess any of the materials prohibited in subdivision (a)(1) while present in any penal\n\ninstitution where prisoners are quartered or under custodial supervision without the\n\nexpress written consent of the chief administrator of the institution.” See Tenn. Code\n\nAnn. § 39-16-201(a)(2) (Supp. 1996). Subsection (a)(1) of the statute includes\n\ncontrolled substances in the list of prohibited materials.\n\n       The appellant contends that the convicting evidence was insufficient because\n\nthe State failed to prove that he possessed the marijuana without the express written\n\nconsent of the prison’s chief administrator. Although we acknowledge that direct\n\ntestimony from the NECC warden would have prevented any issue in this regard, we\n\n                                              6\n\ffind that the essential element concerning the lack of express written consent was\n\nsufficiently proved by circumstantial evidence.\n\n         Circumstantial evidence includes collateral facts and circumstances which do\n\nnot directly prove the fact in issue but from which the fact may be logically inferred.\n\nSee State v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2405770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2405770/state-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 792-93 (Tenn. 1975). We find that the\n\nrecord in this case contains several facts and circumstances sufficient to prove that\n\nthe prison’s chief administrator had not given express written consent to the\n\nappellant’s possession of marijuana.\n\n         First, the record reflects that the appellant’s wife surreptitiously handed the\n\nappellant a package tightly wrapped and concealed in black electrical tape. When\n\nNECC prison guards acted to apprehend the appellant and obtain the hidden\n\npackage, the appellant tried to discard the package by passing it off to other prison\n\ninmates. The actions of the appellant and his wife in attempting to smuggle the\n\npackage into the NECC are clearly inconsistent with the notion that the appellant had\n\nexpress written consent to possess marijuana. From that evidence, a reasonable\n\nperson could conclude that the appellant did not have the warden’s express written\n\nconsent to possess the package of marijuana. See State v. Jimmy Cullop, Jr., No.\n\n03C01-9607-CR-00281 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Knoxville, March 18, 1997).\n\n         Moreover, at the time of the appellant’s offense, marijuana was a Schedule II\n\ncontrolled substance which had no legal use in the State of Tennessee. See Tenn.\n\nCode Ann. § 39-17-408 (6)(A) (1991 repl.). 3 It is almost inconceivable that a prison\n\nadministrator would give permission for an inmate to possess a totally illegal\n\nsubstance in prison. We, therefore, conclude that the jury was justified in finding\n\n         3\n          The T ennes see C ode co ntinues to treat m arijuana a s a Sch edule II co ntrolled su bstanc e. See\nTen n.

See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-407 (1997).

He\n\nargues that the administrative discipline he received from the Tennessee Department\n\nof Correction, prior to trial, precluded the State from prosecuting him thereafter for the\n\nsame offense.\n\n         This issue is without merit.\n\n         Following the discovery of marijuana in the appellant’s possession, the\n\nappellant received administrative discipline by prison authorities at the Tennessee\n\nDepartment of Correction (“TDOC”). 4 The appellant relies on the decision in United\n\nStates v. Halper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112259\"><a href=\"/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112259\"><a href=\"/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1892</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989) to assert that his prosecution\n\nand conviction for the possession of contraband, following administrative discipline for\n\nthe same offense, placed him in double jeopardy.\n\n         The appellant’s reliance on Halper is misplaced. In Halper, the United States\n\nSupreme Court addressed whether the imposition of a $130,000 civil penalty for\n\nMedicare fraud, following a criminal conviction for the same offense, violated double\n\njeopardy. See 109 S.Ct. at 1896. The respondent in Halper had been convicted in\n\ncriminal proceedings before the Government filed a civil suit against him for the same\n\noffense. See id. The Court held that a $130,000 liability in the civil suit constituted a\n\nsecond punishment because the penalty amount was disproportionate to the actual\n\nharm caused by the respondent’s actions. See id. at 1904. The Court, therefore, held\n\n\n\n         4\n           The record contains evidence from a pre-trial hearing in which the appellant’s counsel argued\nthat th e app ellant ’s upc om ing tria l was selec tive pr ose cutio n in vio lation of eq ual pr otec tion a nd do uble\njeopardy. At that hearing, Lieutenant Randy Lee testified that the appellant received three days of\nsegregated confinement as administrative discipline for the marijuana possession. Lieutenant Lee\nfurther tes tified that adm inistrative disc ipline at the N ECC is impo sed by a T DOC Disciplinary B oard.\nAccor ding to Lieu tenant Le e, the Disc iplinary Board never ad ds an a dditional se ntence or jail time to\nwhat the inmate is currently serving. Instead, disciplinary measures include warnings, restrictions of\nprivileges, a ssignm ents of e xtra work duty, and se gregate d confin eme nt.\n\n                                                            8\n\fthat the civil penalty violated double jeopardy.\n\n         The Supreme Court’s decision in Halper is not applicable to the facts in the\n\nappellant’s case. Unlike the respondent in Halper, the appellant was not subjected to\n\nliability in two separate judicial proceedings. To the contrary, the appellant was merely\n\ndisciplined by administrative authorities at the TDOC before his trial in the criminal\n\ncourt.\n\n         It is well settled in Tennessee that administrative proceedings by state prison\n\nauthorities do not place defendants in “jeopardy” within the meaning of the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause. See Turner v. Gore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3894281\"><a href=\"/opinion/4131674/state-ex-rel-turner-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (Tenn. 1943); Ray v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978); Terry Davis v. State, No.\n\n03C01-9610-CR-00358 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Knoxville, June 12, 1997). Therefore,\n\nwe conclude that the administrative discipline in this case did not preclude the State\n\nfrom prosecuting the appellant for the same offense.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n         The appellant next contends that the State arbitrarily selected him for\n\nprosecution in violation of his equal protection rights. The appellant argues that the\n\nNECC warden arbitrarily determines which cases are referred to the district attorney\n\nfor prosecution.\n\n         This issue is without merit.\n\n         The law in Tennessee is well settled that state officials enjoy broad discretion in\n\ndetermining what cases are selected for prosecution. See Cooper v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388301/cooper-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992); Yearwood v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2399721\"><a href=\"/opinion/2399721/yearwood-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1970). That discretion does not violate the principles of equal\n\nprotection unless the choice to prosecute is “deliberately based upon an unjustifiable\n\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.” See Oyler v. Boles,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106333\"><a href=\"/opinion/106333/oyler-v-boles/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456 (1962).\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       In this case, the record is devoid of any evidence demonstrating that the\n\nwarden at the NECC arbitrarily selects cases to be referred for prosecution. To the\n\ncontrary, at a pre-trial hearing, Warden Howard Carlton of the NECC testified that he\n\nconsiders specific factors before deciding whether to refer a case to the district\n\nattorney. Warden Carlton stated that he considers whether the case involves a felony\n\nand whether there are sufficient facts for the district attorney to present in criminal\n\nproceedings. Warden Carlton further stated that criteria such as an inmate’s race,\n\nreligion, or ethnic origin is never considered.\n\n       We find that the discretion exercised by the NECC warden does not violate the\n\nprinciples of equal protection. The appellant’s claim that his prosecution violated the\n\nEqual Protection Clause is without merit.\n\n                                            V.\n\n       The appellant next contends that the chain of custody over the package\n\nmarked as exhibit one was insufficient to allow it into evidence.\n\n       This issue is without merit.\n\n       During the direct examination of Sergeant Carper, the prosecution introduced a\n\nclear plastic bag, marked as exhibit one, containing a plant-like material with black\n\nelectrical tape. The record reflects that the appellant failed to object to the admission\n\nof the plastic bag at trial. Therefore, in this appeal, the appellant has waived any\n\nchallenge to the admission of the package into evidence.\n\n       Moreover, even if the issue were properly preserved for appeal, we find that the\n\nState established legally sufficient chain of custody over the testing and handling of\n\nthe package. We conclude that the trial court exercised proper discretion in allowing\n\nthe package into evidence.\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                                   ____________________________\n                                   WILLIAM M.
