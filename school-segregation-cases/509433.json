JOSEPH H. LOPER, JR.\nCOURT FROM WHICH APPEALED:                 GRENADA COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT\nATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT:                    ROBERT B. McDUFF\nATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE:                     OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n                                           BY: MARVIN L. WHITE, JR.\nNATURE OF THE CASE:                        CIVIL - DEATH PENALTY - POST\n                                           CONVICTION\nDISPOSITION:                               PART ONE: REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n                                           PART TWO: AFFIRMED - 10/22/2009.\nMOTION FOR REHEARING FILED:                01/12/2009\nMANDATE ISSUED:\n\n\n\n\n       EN BANC.\n\n       GRAVES, PRESIDING JUSTICE, FOR THE COURT:\n\n                                       PART ONE\n\n¶1.    The appellant’s motion for rehearing is granted. The previous opinions are withdrawn\n\nand these opinions are substituted therefor.\n\n¶2.    Anthony Joe Doss was convicted of capital murder in the Circuit Court of Grenada\n\nCounty and sentenced to death for the murder of Robert C. Bell. Doss’ conviction and\n\nsentence were affirmed by this Court on direct appeal. Doss v. State, 709 So. 2d 369 (Miss.\n\f1996), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1111, 118 S. Ct. 1684, 140 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1998). In Doss v.\n\nState, 882 So. 2d 176 (Miss. 2004), this Court granted Doss’ Application for Leave to File\n\na Motion to Vacate Judgment and Sentence, finding that Doss was entitled to an evidentiary\n\nhearing in the trial court on the issues of whether he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel during the penalty phase and whether he was mentally retarded. The trial court\n\nconsidered the evidence and found against Doss on both issues. Doss subsequently filed this\n\nappeal. This Court reverses the trial court’s denial of post-conviction relief on the issue of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel and remands this matter to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                               PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n¶3.    Doss was convicted of capital murder in the Circuit Court of Grenada County and\n\nsentenced to death for the murder of Robert C. Bell. Doss’ conviction and sentence were\n\naffirmed by this Court on direct appeal. Doss v. State, 709 So. 2d 369 (Miss. 1996), cert.\n\ndenied, 523 U.S. 1111, 118 S. Ct. 1684, 140 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1998). Doss filed an Application\n\nfor Leave to File Motion to Vacate Judgment of Sentence in this Court in May 2003. This\n\nCourt granted Doss leave to proceed in the trial court on the following issues: (1) Whether\n\nhe was mentally retarded; and (2) whether his trial counsel had been ineffective at the penalty\n\nphase. Doss v. State, 882 So. 2d 176 (Miss. 2004).\n\n¶4.    The Grenada County Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing on this matter on\n\nSeptember 6-7, 2006. Doss presented the following witnesses: Dr. Criss Lott, a psychologist;\n\nLee Bailey, Doss’ trial counsel; Dr. Daniel Grant, a psychologist; Dr. Timothy Summers, a\n\npsychiatrist; Q.T. Doss, Doss’ cousin; Sadie Doss, Doss’ mother; Sandra Price, a daughter\n\n                                              2\n\fof Sam “Joe” Brown, with whom Sadie Doss had lived in Chicago; and Sam Henry Phillips,\n\nDoss’ biological father. The State presented Dr. Gilbert V. MacVaugh, III, a psychologist,\n\nand Dr. Reb McMichael, a psychiatrist, as witnesses. On December 12, 2006, the trial court\n\nentered an Order and an Opinion, finding that Doss was not mentally retarded and that he\n\nwas not denied effective assistance of counsel. Doss’ Motion to Alter or Amend Opinion and\n\nJudgment was denied. Subsequently, Doss filed this appeal, asserting that he did not receive\n\neffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial and that the decision in\n\nAtkins v. Virginia requires that the death sentence in this case be set aside. Atkins, 536 U.S.\n\n304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002).\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n¶5.    The standard of review after an evidentiary hearing in post-conviction-relief (PCR)\n\ncases is well settled. This Court has said:\n\n       “When reviewing a lower court's decision to deny a petition for post\n       conviction relief this Court will not disturb the trial court's factual findings\n       unless they are found to be clearly erroneous.\" Brown v. State, 731 So. 2d 595,\n       598 (Miss. 1999) (citing Bank of Mississippi v. Southern Mem'l Park, Inc.,\n       677 So. 2d 186, 191 (Miss. 1996)) (emphasis added). In making that\n       determination, \"[t]his Court must examine the entire record and accept 'that\n       evidence which supports or reasonably tends to support the findings of fact\n       made below, together with all reasonable inferences which may be drawn\n       therefrom and which favor the lower court's findings of fact . . . .'\" Mullins v.\n       Ratcliff, 515 So. 2d 1183, 1189 (Miss. 1987) (quoting Cotton v. McConnell,\n       435 So. 2d 683, 685 (Miss. 1983)). That includes deference to the circuit judge\n       as the \"sole authority for determining credibility of the witnesses.\" Mullins,\n       515 So. 2d at 1189 (citing Hall v. State ex rel. Waller, 247 Miss. 896, 903,\n       157 So. 2d 781, 784 (1963)).\n\nLoden v. State, 971 So. 2d 548, 572-573 (Miss. 2007). However, “where questions of law\n\nare raised the applicable standard of review is de novo.” Brown v. State, 731 So. 2d 595,\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f598 (Miss. 1999) (citing Bank of Mississippi v. Southern Mem’l Park, Inc., 677 So. 2d 186,\n\n191 (Miss. 1996)). The burden of proof at an evidentiary hearing on a PCR case is on the\n\npetitioner to show “by a preponderance of the evidence” that he is entitled to relief. Miss.\n\nCode Ann. § 99-39-23(7) (Rev. 2007).\n\nI. WHETHER DOSS RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AT\nTHE SENTENCING PHASE OF HIS TRIAL.\n\n¶6.      Doss asserts that defense counsel, Lee Bailey, failed to properly investigate the\n\navailable mitigating evidence and presented only one witness in mitigation at the penalty\n\nphase.\n\n¶7.      The United States Supreme Court established a two-part test for determining a claim\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct.\n\n2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), as follows:\n\n         First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This\n         requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not\n         functioning as the “counsel” guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n         Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance\n         prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so\n         serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\n\nId. at 687.\n\n¶8.      The Court further established that “[t]he proper measure of attorney performance\n\nremains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.” Id. at 688. “The\n\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable\n\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694.\n\nWith regard to an attorney’s duty to investigate, the Court said the following in Strickland:\n\n                                                   4\n\f         These standards require no special amplification in order to define counsel’s\n         duty to investigate, the duty at issue in this case. As the Court of Appeals\n         concluded, strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts\n         relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic\n         choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely\n         to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on\n         investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n         investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular\n         investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision\n         not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the\n         circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgment.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91.\n\n¶9.      This Court has applied the Strickland standard numerous times and has further said,\n\n“an attorney’s lapse must be viewed in light of the nature and seriousness of the charges and\n\nthe potential penalty.” See Ross v. State, 954 So. 2d 968, 1004 (Miss. 2007) (citing State v.\n\nTokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1343 (Miss. 1990)). In Ross, defense counsel offered, as\n\nmitigating evidence during the sentencing phase, the testimony of Ross’ mother,\n\ngrandmother, and daughter, a minister from the jail, and a sheriff who had arrested Ross.\n\nThe testimony referenced Ross’ character, and the witnesses described Ross as a “good\n\nprisoner.” Id. at 1005. Counsel’s failure to investigate Ross’ inmate record led to the\n\nadmission of highly prejudicial evidence on cross-examination. Ross’ counsel also failed to\n\nconduct an adequate investigation into potentially mitigating factors, including Ross’\n\npsychological problems, and failed to obtain an expert to testify to these factors. This Court\n\nnoted:\n\n               While courts must defer to lawyers’ judgments and strategies, “at a\n         minimum, counsel has a duty to interview potential witnesses and to make\n         independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case.”\n         Ferguson v. State, 507 So. 2d 94, 96 (Miss. 1987). Under this standard,\n         counsel may be deemed ineffective for relying almost exclusively on material\n\n                                               5\n\f       furnished by the State during discovery and conducting no independent\n       investigation. Id. While counsel is not required to exhaust every conceivable\n       avenue of investigation, he or she must at least conduct sufficient investigation\n       to make an informed evaluation about potential defenses. State v. Tokman,\n       564 So. 2d at 1343.\n\nRoss, 954 So. 2d at 1005. This Court further said:\n\n       [C]ounsel will not be deemed ineffective if there is proof of investigation or\n       if there is no factual basis for the defendant’s claim. However, each of these\n       principles presuppose a certain level of investigation. By contrast, “strategic\n       choices made after less than complete investigation will not pass muster as an\n       excuse when a full investigation would have revealed a large body of\n       mitigating evidence.” . . . “It is not reasonable to refuse to investigate when\n       the investigator does not know the relevant facts the investigation will\n       uncover.”\n\nRoss, 954 So. 2d at 1006 (citation omitted).\n\n¶10.   In his application for leave filed with this Court in 2003, Doss relied on affidavits1\n\nfrom several people with various connections to him, including: Lee Bailey, trial attorney;\n\nKelvin Winbush, Bailey’s investigator; Carolyn Watkins, the public defender who handled\n\na separate murder charge against Doss in Shelby County, Tennessee; Sadie Doss, mother;\n\nVerlene Forest Williams, friend; Carolyn Phillips, aunt; Ernestine Williams, aunt; Lucretia\n\nMonger, sister; Randy Doss, brother; Roselyn Monette Jackson, aunt; Mary Jennings, aunt;\n\nJohn Westmoreland, formerly married to an aunt; Annette James, girlfriend; Marvin Doss,\n\n\n\n       1\n          Incredulously, in her dissent, Justice Lamar characterizes our analysis of the affidavits as\n“lengthy and unnecessary” and then says “it is improper for this Court to consider” the affidavits of\nLee Bailey and Kelvin Winbush because “they were never admitted into evidence before the trial\ncourt. . . .” However, Justice Lamar quoted these very affidavits at length in her previous majority\nopinion, which is now being withdrawn on rehearing. Moreover, we quote the published opinion\nof this Court, Doss v. State, 882 So. 2d 176 (Miss. 2004), on Doss’ original application for leave and\nthe trial court herein regarding these affidavits, which were indeed filed. Further, the trial court\nspecifically discussed the affidavits in his Order and noted that he considered the affidavit of Lee\nBailey. Finally, there was no objection to the use of Bailey’s affidavit in the trial court.\n\n                                                  6\n\fhalf-brother; Q.T. Doss, cousin; Lillie Moore, aunt; Sandra Price, daughter of Sam “Joe”\n\nBrown, who lived with Doss’ mother in Chicago; Chantay Price, Sandra Price’s sixteen-year-\n\nold daughter; Varnado McDonald, step-sister of Lucretia Monger; Carrie Cole, aunt; Rosie\n\nCaldwell, friend of Doss’ mother; and Sam Phillips, biological father.\n\n¶11.   With regard to the affidavit of defense counsel Lee Bailey, this Court summarized:\n\n               Doss relies first on the affidavit of his trial attorney who states that:\n       Doss’ was the first case he had defended where the death penalty was sought;\n       he did not seek any school, medical, mental health or other records, because\n       he did not realize the importance of the records in presenting a defense during\n       the sentencing phase; he did not seek advice from a mental health expert, funds\n       for a mental health expert or any kind of mental health evaluation; and he did\n       not obtain any records resulting from the investigation of criminal charges\n       against Doss in Shelby County, but he did obtain the indictment and judgment\n       in that case. Bailey also obtained the appointment of an investigator, Kelvin\n       Winbush, who was also the investigator for Doss’ co-defendant, Frederick\n       Bell. Bailey stated that Winbush told him he had interviewed: Doss’ aunt,\n       Lillie Moore, Doss’ sisters, Lucretia Monger and Mavis McCaster; Doss’\n       brothers, Marvin Doss and Randy Doss; and John Westmoreland and that all\n       stated that Doss was a good and/or quiet person who got involved with the\n       wrong crowd. Bailey did not follow up with these witnesses or ask them to\n       testify at the sentencing phase. Bailey stated that Winbush told him he had\n       contacted two teachers in Bruce, a Mrs. Parker and a Coach Smith, but it was\n       questionable as to whether these people actually knew Doss, or whether they\n       had mistaken him for Frederick Bell. Bailey did not realize that a conflict\n       might result from using Winbush, where one of Bailey’s potential defense\n       strategies was to blame Bell as the instigator of the shooting. Bailey states that\n       he interviewed only Doss’ mother and an aunt for a few minutes. Bailey states\n       that he felt he did a good job in defending the case at the guilt phase, but that\n       he did not know what he was doing as to the sentencing phase.\n\nDoss, 882 So. 2d at 186.\n\n¶12.   As to the affidavit of investigator Kelvin Winbush, this Court said:\n\n              Kelvin Winbush’s affidavit states that this was his first mitigation\n       investigation, and that he was also the investigator for Frederick Bell.\n       Winbush identified Lillie Moore, Lucretia Monger, Mavis McCaster, Marvin\n       Doss, Randy Doss, and John Westmoreland, a friend, as favorable mitigation\n\n\n                                               7\n\f       witnesses. Winbush also identified Coach Smith, a teacher and coach in\n       Bruce, as someone who knew Anthony and said he “behaved fairly well for the\n       most part.” Winbush stated that he gave Bailey contact information for some\n       of the witnesses, and Bailey knew Winbush had contact information for them\n       all. Winbush says that he was never asked to follow up with the witnesses, to\n       arrange for subpoenas, to arrange for their presence at trial, or to look for\n       additional witnesses after Winbush’s initial report. He was also not asked to\n       do any investigating in Chicago.\n\nId.\n\n¶13.   Carolyn Watkins, public defender in Shelby County, “states in an affidavit that she\n\nobtained school records for Doss from Chicago; Doss’ medical records from Chicago,\n\nincluding records involving a 1986 head injury; and the 1988 psychological report done at\n\nthe University of Mississippi. She states that Lee Bailey never requested these records.” Id.\n\n¶14.   As to the remaining affidavits, this Court characterized them as follows:\n\n       The affiants say that Doss was shy and quiet, not a violent person; that there\n       were times when Doss seemed to go into a seizure or trance of some kind,\n       when he did not respond to people; that he had mental or medical problems\n       that began with his mother’s drinking and drug use during her pregnancy with\n       him, followed by lead poisoning and head injuries during Doss’ childhood;\n       that mental illness seemed to run in the Doss family; that Doss was easily led\n       by Frederick Bell, who was a bad, violent person and came from a violent\n       family; that Doss began to run with a bad crowd when he moved from Chicago\n       to Mississippi; that Doss’ birth and upbringing in Chicago were riddled with\n       crime, drug abuse and poverty. Specifically mentioned and blamed for much\n       of the misfortune suffered by Doss and his family in Chicago was Sam Brown,\n       who lived with Doss’ mother. Doss apparently believed for much of his early\n       life that Sam Brown was his biological father. According to various affidavits,\n       Sam Brown was violent and abusive toward Doss, his mother and the rest of\n       the family; he took what little money the family had to buy drugs and gamble;\n       and he sold drugs and introduced the children in the family to drugs.\n\nDoss, 882 So. 2d at 187.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f¶15.   In finding that Doss should have the opportunity to present evidence to the trial court\n\nin support of his claim that counsel’s failure to investigate and present available mitigation\n\nevidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court said:\n\n       We acknowledge that many discrepancies exist among the affidavits presented\n       by Doss in support of this issue. However, we conclude that Doss has made\n       a sufficient showing under the Strickland test that Bailey’s efforts fell short of\n       the efforts a counsel should make in a death penalty sentencing trial, so as to\n       entitle Doss to an evidentiary hearing on this claim in the circuit court. This\n       was Bailey’s first death penalty case, and he admitted that he did not know\n       what he was doing in the sentencing phase. When counsel makes choices of\n       which witnesses to use or not use, those choices must be made based on\n       counsel’s proper investigation. Counsel’s minimum duty is to interview\n       potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and\n       circumstances of the case.\n\nId. at 189.\n\n¶16.   The trial court held a PCR evidentiary hearing in 2006 and heard testimony from Lee\n\nBailey, Q.T. Doss, Sadie Doss, Sandra Price and Sam Phillips. On December 12, 2006, the\n\ntrial court issued an opinion, finding that Doss had not received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. We find the trial court’s findings to be clearly erroneous.\n\n¶17.   Doss’ application for leave to this Court included, as an exhibit, an affidavit from\n\nBailey, which stated, in relevant part:\n\n               3. Prior to this, I had never represented a defendant in a capital murder\n       case where the death penalty was sought.\n               4. I did not seek or obtain any school, medical, mental health, or other\n       records regarding Mr. Doss. This was not for any strategic reasons. I did not\n       realize the importance of obtaining such records in order to prepare for the\n       sentencing phase of a capital case.\n               5. I knew the defendant, Mr. Doss, had grown up in Chicago and had\n       gone to elementary school and into the beginning of high school there. I was\n       aware that Mr. Doss had been in special education classes in Chicago and also\n       suffered from blackouts and headaches. However, I did not understand the\n       significance of this and did not seek any advice from a mental health expert.\n\n\n                                               9\n\fAlso, I did not request funds for a mental health expert or any type of mental\nhealth evaluation. This was not for any strategic reason.\n        6. I did not obtain any records from the investigation done in Memphis\nby Mr. Doss’ attorney there. However, I did obtain the indictment and\njudgment in that case.\n...\n        9. I did not ask Mr. Winbush [investigator who provided statements\nand contact information for several potential witnesses to Bailey] to follow up\nwith any of these potential witnesses, or with anyone else, and I did not follow\nup with them myself to obtain more information or to determine for myself\nwhether they would be helpful witnesses. I did not ask any of them to testify\nat the sentencing phase. This was not for any particular strategic reason.\n        10. Other than the family members just mentioned and Mr.\nWestmoreland [possible witness who knew Doss], the only other specific\nindividuals Mr. Winbush identified that he had talked to were two teachers in\nBruce, Mississippi, Mrs. Parker and someone he identified only as “Coach\nSmith.” But it was Freddie Bell who had gone to school in Bruce, not Mr.\nDoss, who lived in Calhoun City. Indeed, Mr. Winbush told me that Mrs.\nParker had only taught Mr. Bell, not Mr. Doss. Mr. Winbush said that “Coach\nSmith” knew Mr. Doss and that Mr. Doss had behaved well around him. He\nnever explained how Coach Smith knew Mr. Doss. I did not ask Mr. Winbush\nto go back for clarification, or to go back and try to find others who might\nknow Mr. Doss as opposed to Mr. Bell, including those who lived in Calhoun\nCity where Mr. Doss presently lived. I did not do this investigation myself and\ndid not try to contact Coach Smith myself.\n        11. Although I knew Mr. Winbush was working as the investigator for\nMr. Bell, I did not consider at the time how this posed a conflict of interest.\nI was not particularly focused on obtaining evidence for the sentencing phase\nto show that Mr. Bell was the more culpable of the two, and that he had\ndominated Mr. Doss and led him into these misdeeds. Had I been focused on\nthat, I might have realized the conflict and sought another investigator.\n        12. To the extent that Mr. Winbush claimed that he spent 100-120\nhours investigating this case, I do not believe this is accurate. Even if you\ninclude the time he spent driving and looking for people, I do not think he\nspent that much time.\n        13. I did not do any mitigation investigation in Chicago, where Mr.\nDoss grew up and lived most of his life, and I did not ask Mr. Winbush to do\nso. I did not contact any witnesses or family members there. I did not seek\nfunds from the Court for such an investigation. This was not for any strategic\nreason.\n        14. My time records show that the only family members or friends who\nI interviewed were the defendant’s mother, who was the only witness I\npresented at the punishment phase, and one of the defendant’s aunts, who I did\n\n\n                                      10\n\f       not call as a witness. The discussion with them lasted only a few minutes\n       according to my records. I did talk again with the defendant’s mother during\n       the trial, and prior to her testimony, I discussed the possible testimony with\n       her. However, this discussion was not lengthy and I did not spend much time\n       interviewing her or preparing her to take the stand.\n               15. The omissions that I have mentioned in this affidavit with respect\n       to the mitigation investigation were not motivated by any particular strategic\n       reason. Although I believe I did a good job in defending this case at the guilt\n       phase, I had never handled a punishment phase in a capital case before. It is\n       unlike anything I have ever done. There’s no other proceeding that I have ever\n       been involved in where the jury decides the punishment, and of course, none\n       where the stakes were this high. My omissions in the punishment phase in this\n       case were due, I believe, to my inexperience in this particular type of\n       proceeding. Looking back on it, I believe now that I provided a good defense\n       at the guilt phase, but that I failed to undertake the essential functions of\n       properly and thoroughly investigating mitigation and presenting a defense at\n       the penalty phase.\n               16. If I failed to make any objections during the trial that should have\n       been made, that was not the result of any strategy decisions.\n\nLee Bailey Aff. (Aug. 23, 2001).\n\n¶18.   After the PCR hearing, the trial court found that the “testimony of Lee Bailey was in\n\nsharp contrast with the information that was contained in the affidavit” submitted to this\n\nCourt, but that Bailey was not trying to mislead, because he did not have access to his case\n\nfile when he signed the affidavit and was “relying on his memory of events that had taken\n\nplace over eight years earlier.” The trial court also noted that Bailey believed he had not\n\nobtained records from Carolyn Watkins, Doss’ public defender in Memphis, when he signed\n\nthe affidavit, but then realized two days before trial that he had actually gotten some of these\n\nrecords.\n\n¶19.   The trial court’s reasoning was incorrect. Bailey’s inability to remember that he had\n\nactually obtained these records could not have been because he did not have access to his\n\nfile. Bailey admitted during redirect examination that the file was available any time he\n\n\n                                              11\n\frequested it and that McDuff, Doss’ present counsel, went so far as to offer to drive the file\n\nto Bailey. Also, the following exchange occurred between McDuff and Bailey during the\n\nhearing:\n\n       Q.      Was there ever a time that you asked me to look at that file that I didn’t\n               get it to you within a few days?\n       A.      No.\n       Q.      Okay.\n       A.      Now, there was – there was something he asked awhile ago about\n       meeting halfway in Jackson. I remember something about that. But no,\n       you’ve always been cordial. You always – whenever I wanted something, you\n       had it right there.\n\n¶20.   Moreover, the portion of the file containing the records that Bailey found two days\n\nbefore trial was not even included in the file that was given to McDuff, but rather was found\n\nin a storage box in Bailey’s office. Specifically, Bailey testified during direct examination\n\nin the PCR hearing:\n\n       A.      I got some records from Memphis. I think that Caroline Watson [sic]\n       either had them sent to me by someone else or she sent them to me. I don’t\n       know, but I got them in my possession. And they weren’t in the regular file.\n       ...\n       Q.      Okay. And, and where did you find them?\n       A.      In an old file of mine, a big box that I had old criminal files stored away\n       in. I found them in there.\n       Q.      Were they in a particular file folder that was labeled?\n       A.      No.\n\n¶21.   Bailey further testified that the documents that he discovered two days before the PCR\n\nhearing included records from North Mississippi Medical Center, Shelby County government\n\n(from Joyce King, legal investigator), Bethany Hospital in Chicago, and a psychological\n\nreport from the University of Mississippi. Bailey also acknowledged that some of the reports\n\nwere missing multiple pages and he had never obtained complete copies. Moreover, with the\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fexception of the “forgotten” records, the remainder of Bailey’s testimony at the PCR hearing\n\nverified his sworn statements in the affidavit, for example:\n\n       Q.      And prior to you signing that affidavit you and I – prior to any affidavit\n       being drafted you and I talked about this case, didn’t we? I came to your\n       office and we talked.\n       A.      Sure. Sure.\n       Q.      And then I drafted an affidavit, and I brought it back to you. And you\n       and I went over it line-by-line, didn’t we?\n       A.      Sure.\n       Q.      And you told me that everything in there that you signed in the file [sic]\n       version was true, didn’t you?\n       A.      Sure.\n       Q.      You signed it under oath, didn’t you?\n       A.      Sure.\n       Q.      Now, did you lie in that affidavit?\n       A.      I didn’t remember about those files that I got from Caroline Watson\n               [sic].\n       Q.      Right. You thought you had not requested those.\n       A.      I didn’t think I had those.\n       Q.      Is there any place other than that where you said something – you\n       believed it was true at the time. Was there any place where you said\n       something you didn’t believe was true?\n       A.      No. No. Paragraph 5, about him growing up in Chicago. Yeah. That’s\n       true. Having black-outs. Yeah. I didn’t seek a medical health expert. That’s\n       true. I didn’t think that Winbush was a conflict of interest. You know, that’s\n       true. I didn’t ask him to follow up on any of these witnesses. That’s true.\n               But now, not being particularly focused on the sentencing hearing,\n       some things have been said in here today that leads me to think that yeah, I\n       was trying to get some witnesses for the sentencing. But as far as I was\n       concerned and having as little experience as I had, which was absolutely none,\n       I didn’t see that there were any witnesses other than what we had.\n       Q.      And do you recall that when you and I talked about this case, I had your\n               file with me, brought it to Grenada prior to you signing the affidavit so\n               you could go through it?\n       A.      Brought it to Winona.\n       Q.      I mean to Winona. I’m sorry.\n       A.      Yes. You brought it to Winona. Yes.\n       Q.      You had it there prior to signing the affidavit.\n       A.      You talking about five years ago?\n       Q.      Yeah.\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       A.     I don’t remember that. I just know – I know that you came up and came\n       up fairly often I thought. You were really diligent, but I don’t – I just\n       remember signing the affidavit.\n              In fact, I didn’t even remember what was in it. When Doug Evans\n       [prosecutor] was asking me about it, I said I signed an affidavit. I don’t\n       remember what it was. But, you know, memory – memory is slipping a little.\n       Q.     Right. Are you able to say at this point – I want to make this clear. Are\n       you saying at this point that we did not go through the file prior to you signing\n       that?\n       A.     No, I am not saying that. You went through everything thoroughly.\n       Q.     And in Paragraphs 4 and 6 about the records, as soon as you found\n       those records you told me; right?\n       A.     Right.\n\n¶22.   The trial court further found that Doss and his mother were not “forthcoming with\n\nmany witnesses who could offer testimony that would be favorable to Anthony,” and that\n\nBailey was given the name of Derma Police Chief Mark Hendrix, but chose not to call him\n\nbecause of an unfavorable ruling on a motion in limine.2 Specifically, the trial court found\n\nthat “[t]his shows that Bailey made an effort to locate any witnesses that Anthony believed\n\ncould offer testimony that would be favorable to him.” The trial court said:\n\n               This court during the evidentiary hearing heard many tales of woe\n       concerning the environment in which Anthony was reared, including an\n       abusive father/stepfather and an indifferent and alcoholic mother. However,\n       this information was not provided to Bailey during his representation of Doss.\n       Sadie testified that she did not share the information concerning Anthony with\n       Bailey. She stated that only after getting to know McDuff and thinking of him\n       as a brother, did she share information with McDuff concerning the details of\n       her life and of Anthony’s upbringing.\n               This court does not believe that the failure of Bailey to learn the sordid\n       details of the life of Sadie Doss and of Anthony, in any way indicates that\n       Bailey was ineffective. He was relying on Sadie and Anthony to provide\n       information about Anthony’s life and of potential witnesses that could testify\n       favorably about Anthony. If those two did not provide that information to\n       Bailey, he is not to blame for their lack of forthrightness. Only from them,\n\n       2\n        Bailey admitted during redirect examination that he also could have filed a motion in limine\nto prohibit the introduction of evidence of the youth court charges, but failed to do so.\n\n                                                14\n\f       could he have learned the names of Q.T. Doss, Sam Phillips, Sandra Price, or\n       the individuals that submitted affidavits to the Mississippi Supreme Court, but\n       did not testify at the hearing.\n\nOp’n, Circuit Court of Grenada County, at pp. 9-10 (Dec. 12, 2006).\n\n¶23.   The trial court said that Sadie had failed to provide certain information to the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi during an unrelated proceeding in 1988 and during a brief\n\ndiscussion with Bailey in 1993, saying:\n\n       This court will not speculate as to whether she failed to provide this\n       information to the University of Mississippi and to Bailey due to\n       embarrassment, or whether much of her testimony in the evidentiary hearing\n       was a figment of her imagination due to too many years of drinking Crown\n       Royal and beer, or whether her testimony is laced with perjury [n4] and\n       exaggeration in an attempt to free Anthony from death row. However, this\n       court is of the opinion that Bailey did the best he could with the 1993 version\n       of the truth that was provided by Sadie.\n\n                 n4     She either perjured herself in Anthony’s original trial or\n                 at the evidentiary hearing. At the trial, she testified that Sam\n                 Brown was Anthony’s father. Now she claims his father is Sam\n                 Phillips.\n\nOp’n at p. 11.\n\n¶24.   However, the trial court’s findings are contradicted by the record in this matter. The\n\nrecord establishes that Bailey spoke only briefly to Sadie by telephone and never met with\n\nher in person prior to Doss’ trial in 1993. Further, during the sentencing phase of Doss’ trial,\n\nBailey failed to ask a single question that would evoke any “sordid details of the life of Sadie\n\nand Anthony” or that would evoke any “tales of woe” about abuse as stated by the trial court.\n\nThe relevant portions of Sadie’s testimony on direct examination by Bailey from 1993 are\n\nas follows:\n\n       Q.        Now, where was Anthony born?\n\n\n                                                15\n\fA.    Chicago.\nQ.    And, who is his father?\nA.    Sam Brown.\nQ.    Is Sam here today?\nA.    No, he’s not. He don’t know anything about it.\n...\nA.    He’s not here. He don’t know anything about it. I got – I tried to get\n      in touch with him, but I couldn’t.\nQ.    And, are you and Sam married?\nA.    No, we not; common law.\nQ.    How long did Anthony live in Chicago?\nA.    I think 16 years, if I’m not mistaken. 15 or 16 years.\nQ.    And, then where did he move to?\nA.    Calhoun City.\nQ.    And, he’s been living there with you?\nA.    Yes.\nQ.    Did he go to school there?\nA.    A period of time.\nQ.    How long?\nA.    I really don’t know. I think about a couple of months.\nQ.    What grade has Anthony completed in school?\nA.    It was ‘twixt [sic] the 9th and the 10th.\nQ.    Has he been working?\nA.    No. He went to look for a job. They say he’s too short and too young.\n...\nQ.    Do you have any other relatives that live there with you?\nA.    Talking about in Calhoun City?\nQ.    Uh-huh. (Affirmative.)\nA.    When Anthony was with me?\nQ.    Uh-huh. (Affirmative.)\nA.    Yes, I did.\nQ.    How many?\nA.    One.\nQ.    And, what kind of home did you have?\nA.    Beautiful home. One more thing. You say who all stayed. My other\n      – I have one daughter stayed with me, period.\nQ.    Now, do you work?\nA.    No, I don’t. I been sick.\nQ.    Huh?\nA.    I’m sick.\nQ.    How long you been sick?\nA.    For 20-something years.\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\f       Q.     Now, what kind of income does your family have? When Anthony was\n              living there with you?\n       A.     I was on welfare at the time.\n       ...\n       Q.     And, he didn’t graduate from high school?\n       A.     Only from the 8th.\n       Q.     Now, you know Anthony. Would you tell us how – what kind of\n              person is Anthony?\n       A.     Anthony was a warm, beautiful person, and he alway [sic] at home with\n              me, and when I was sick he always would get up and he try to fix me\n              food. Sometimes I can’t walk. The arthritis have me sometimes. Like\n              today, I may be able to walk just as straight as any of y’all and then the\n              next couple of days, I may not can walk. I have to walk with a crutch.\n              And, he would do for me. He always said, “Mama, I want to get a job,\n              where I can take care of you.” And, Anthony also was playing ball one\n              day and this – a man came through the alley and hit him on the head\n              and busted his head, and I took him to the doctor. He had a concussion.\n              So, Anthony was very good. And, after that he started having\n              headaches, and I took him to the doctor.\n       Q.     When was this that he got hit in the head?\n       A.     It was when he was about 11. And he also got hit in the head when he\n              was about 17, I think. At 17 he got hit in the head again.\n       Q.     Now, when you say hit in the head, are you talking serious?\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     All right, hospital?\n       A.     I took him to the hospital and they release him, and he also was hit\n              again and he was taken to the hospital, and they sent me a statement\n              from Chicago – from the hospital – that – I don’t have the papers now\n              – that his hand was hurt and his head was busted.\n       Q.     All right, now, when he got hit in the head these times did you notice\n              any change in Anthony?\n       A.     He would have headaches. Some days he won’t say nothing. Then, the\n              next day, he talk. But, he didn’t bother nobody.\n\n¶25.   Clearly, counsel was aware of Doss’ head injuries, yet failed to investigate the details\n\nbehind these injuries or to present any other evidence during the sentencing phase regarding\n\nthe extent of the injuries and any long term or permanent damage -- despite portions of the\n\nhospital records and various psychological evaluation reports being provided to Bailey by\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fthe public defender’s office in Shelby County.3 If counsel had inquired further into Doss’\n\ninjuries, counsel easily would have obtained the names of potential witnesses such as Sandra\n\nPrice, whom the record reveals was raped during the same home invasion when Doss was\n\nbeaten with a pipe. If counsel had reviewed the records in his possession, he also would have\n\ndiscovered other possible witnesses, including Doss’ brothers and sisters. Also, counsel\n\nappeared surprised at Sadie’s statement that she had been sick. Counsel failed to ask a single\n\nquestion about whether Doss had ever been abused, what kind of environment he had been\n\nexposed to in Chicago, how he did in school, whether he was in special education classes,\n\nor anything else that could have been mitigating. Counsel merely asked what kind of home\n\nSadie had in Mississippi, not Chicago, and what kind of person Doss was, without delving\n\ninto any other relevant evidence. The duty of reasonable investigation rests squarely on\n\ncounsel’s shoulders. There is nothing in the record to establish that counsel undertook a\n\nreasonable investigation.\n\n¶26.   During the PCR hearing, Sadie Doss testified that Sam Brown is the father of her\n\nother son, Randy Doss, and that she was living with Sam Brown at the time she became\n\npregnant with Anthony. Sadie testified that Sam Phillips is actually Doss’ biological father,\n\nbut that Doss was told his father was Sam Brown and that she felt Sam Brown was his father\n\nbecause he helped raise Doss. Sadie further testified that the family suffered violent abuse\n\nat the hands of Sam Brown, who Doss believed was his father for several years and with\n\nwhom they lived until Doss was approximately fifteen years old. Sadie testified that she\n\n\n       3\n         The dissent would find Bailey’s failure to investigate Doss’ head injuries as proper under\nan entirely separate and inapplicable theory of competency. The dissent later notes the trial court’s\nfinding that “Doss did not appear to be insane.” Doss’ sanity is not at issue.\n\n                                                 18\n\fdrank heavily during her pregnancy with Doss, that Sam Brown beat her so violently that she\n\nbegan bleeding and almost suffered a miscarriage, that Sam Brown infected her with\n\ngonorrhea while she was pregnant, and that she took the medication Valium while she was\n\npregnant. In addition, Sadie testified that Doss had lead poisoning as a child; that he had\n\nwitnessed Sam Brown beating her; that he was beaten and abused by Sam Brown; that Sam\n\nBrown had abused drugs and spent the family’s money on drugs; that the family had lived\n\nin a very poor, bad, drug-infested neighborhood where gangs were prevalent in Chicago;4 and\n\nprovided various other relevant evidence that trial counsel failed to even inquire about during\n\nthe sentencing phase of Doss’ original trial.\n\n¶27.   With regard to personal information that was not reported during the interview at the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi in 1988 stemming from an unrelated youth court matter, Sadie\n\ntestified as follows:\n\n       Q.     Okay. Now, these sorts of things, the things that – the infection you\n              got, the beatings while you were pregnant, the beatings while you were\n              with Sam Brown, are those things you would – you would tell\n              strangers?\n       A.     No.\n       Q.     Would you tell many people about those things?\n       A.     No.\n       Q.     Why not?\n       A.     It would hurt me, and people laugh. I had told someone, and they\n              laughed about it.\n       Q.     Do you – do you ever remember taking Anthony to be seen by a\n              psychologist over in Oxford?\n       A.     Yes.\n\n\n       4\n         Sandra Price, Sam Brown’s daughter who also lived with the family in Chicago, likewise\ntestified during the PCR hearing that the family had lived in a very bad neighborhood, and that\nBrown had used drugs and was very angry and abusive toward the family. Price also testified about\nthe home invasion in which she was raped and Doss was beaten, suffering a head injury, and that\nDoss was very quiet and kept to himself.\n\n                                                19\n\f       Q.     Okay. Do you remember them asking you about your pregnancy?\n       A.     No, I don’t.\n       ...\n       Q.     Miss Doss, you said you didn’t tell many people about this. Why did\n              you tell me?\n       A.     Well, y’all were just so comfort [sic]. Just like he was my own family,\n              and I would talk to y’all. Just something there about you was just like\n              family, and I don’t tell everybody.\n       Q.     Did you and I spend a lot of time together?\n       A.     Yeah.\n       Q.     Did you feel like you got to know me?\n       A.     Yes, I did. Just like if you was a brother.\n       Q.     Did I explain this might be important for Anthony’s case?\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     Did I ask you to make up anything?\n       A.     No.\n       Q.     Did I ask you to say something that wasn’t true?\n       A.     No.\n       ...\n       Q.     Did Lee Bailey ask you about any of these private – would he ask you\n              any of these questions about private details, the lawyer, Anthony’s trial\n              lawyer?\n       A.     No, he did not.\n       Q.     Okay. Did you feel like you got to know Mr. Bailey very well?\n       A.     No, I did not.\n\n¶28.   Also, testimony was offered by psychological experts during the PCR hearing as to\n\nwhy Sadie initially may not have provided this information. During direct examination of\n\ncourt-appointed expert Dr. Criss Lott, counsel for Doss asked Lott whether it was necessary\n\nto spend time with people to get them to discuss private matters. Lott answered: “That\n\nvaries. I think some people may be very open. Some people certainly may be reluctant. In\n\nthe custody evaluations I do, I rarely get information from people. They don’t want to get\n\ninvolved. No matter how many times I try to contact someone like that, I may never get any\n\ninformation.” Further, during cross examination of Lott, the State elicited as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       Q.      Yeah. But, but you are – you have to rely on this sort of stuff and the\n       validity of those things. Do you find it interesting that the problems that Miss\n       Doss decided she had after the conviction, much longer after he was convicted\n       and sentenced to death, are not the same ones she had when she was having\n       him treated in 1988 at the – or interviewed or assessed at Ole Miss or at\n       Tupelo?\n               MR. MCDUFF: I am going to object to that evidence. It makes a\n       characterization that is not supported by the evidence or in the evidence.\n               THE COURT: I’ll overrule the objection.\n       A.      Mr. White, the evaluation that was done in ‘88 by the University of\n       Mississippi was a youth court evaluation which was looking, assessing Mr.\n       Doss at that time prior to going to possibly training school. It was not what I\n       would consider to be a comprehensive evaluation and certainly not a\n       comprehensive forensic evaluation. I do those evaluations too, the youth\n       court. And my report would not be as exhaustive and I would ask the mother\n       about substance abuse history but a lot of times they may be minimizing that,\n       because it is not something that they want to own up to at that point.\n               So it’s – I see it. I see that occasionally, that people – in terms of the\n       context that if I’m trying to get an evaluation for a child as to whether or not\n       they should get mental health treatment and go to Oakley. I don’t always get\n       all the data from the parents.\n               And I’ll evaluate the parent, but they may not tell me everything at that\n       time. So it’s – I see that and I understand your concern here. But for me it\n       hasn’t been that unusual, not to get all the data in certain cases.\n\n¶29.   Dr. Timothy Summers also testified about this:\n\n       Q.     In obtaining information that a person might consider private or\n       embarrassing, is it important for the psychologist or psychiatrist, whoever is\n       interviewing them, to take their time with that person to explain?\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     Explain why this private, perhaps embarrassing, information is being\n       sought.\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     Dr. Lott testified earlier about the difference between the cursory\n       evaluation and more extensive forensic evaluation. Is it possible that a cursory\n       evaluation, like a youth court evaluation, a person might not reveal\n       embarrassing information but then later might do so once they are approached\n       and the importance is explained to them of talking about private details?\n       A.     Yes.\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fAgain, there is nothing in the record to indicate Bailey ever asked Sadie any questions that\n\nwould elicit this evidence. Moreover, even if neither Doss nor Sadie had provided any\n\nmitigating evidence, Bailey still would not have been relieved of his duty to investigate. See\n\nRompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2005) (“[E]ven when\n\na capital defendant’s family members and the defendant himself have suggested that no\n\nmitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and\n\nreview material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of\n\naggravation at the sentencing phase . . . .”) In Rompilla, the evidence in mitigation\n\nincluded the brief testimony of five of Rompilla’s family members arguing for residual\n\ndoubt, asking for mercy, and saying that Rompilla was innocent and a good man. On PCR,\n\nRompilla raised ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to present significant mitigating\n\nevidence about his childhood, mental capacity and health, and alcoholism. The trial court\n\ndenied relief, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Rompilla then petitioned for\n\na writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, which found, in relevant part, that counsel\n\nhad failed to investigate “pretty obvious signs” of Rompilla’s troubled childhood and his\n\nmental illness and alcoholism, “and instead had relied unjustifiably on Rompilla’s own\n\ndescription of an unexceptional background.” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 379. The Third Circuit\n\nCourt of Appeals reversed, finding in part that counsel had attempted to uncover mitigation\n\nevidence by interviewing Rompilla and family members and by consulting with three mental\n\nhealth experts. After granting certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed, noting\n\nthat this “case, like some others recently, looks to norms of adequate investigation in\n\npreparing for the sentencing phase of a capital trial, when defense counsel’s job is to counter\n\n                                              22\n\fthe State’s evidence of aggravated culpability with evidence in mitigation.” Id. at 380-81.\n\nApplying a standard of reasonableness, the Court addressed the minimal contributions of\n\nRompilla and his family members to any mitigation case and the lack of useful information\n\nprovided by the mental health reports. The Court also said:\n\n               When new counsel entered the case to raise Rompilla’s postconviction\n       claims, however, they identified a number of likely avenues the trial lawyers\n       could fruitfully have followed in building a mitigation case. School records\n       are one example, which trial counsel never examined in spite of the professed\n       unfamiliarity of the several family members with Rompilla’s childhood, and\n       despite counsel’s knowledge that Rompilla left school after the ninth grade. .\n       . . Other examples are records of Rompilla’s juvenile and adult incarcerations,\n       which counsel did not consult, although they were aware of their client’s\n       criminal record. And while counsel knew from police reports provided in\n       pretrial discovery that Rompilla had been drinking heavily at the time of his\n       offense, . . . , and although one of the mental health experts reported that\n       Rompilla’s troubles with alcohol merited further investigation, . . . , counsel\n       did not look for evidence of a history of dependence on alcohol that might\n       have extenuating significance.\n\nRompilla, 545 U.S. at 382 (citations omitted).\n\n¶30.   In the instant case, Bailey somehow obtained the records from the separate action in\n\nMemphis, although he was unclear on how exactly that came about, but there is no evidence\n\nhe ever actually reviewed the records, which would have opened up several possible\n\nmitigation leads. These reports included information that Doss: drank alcohol regularly and\n\nhad started drinking at age eleven; had tried other drugs; was in special education classes and\n\nhad done poorly in school; had a low IQ; had family and legal issues in Chicago; exhibited\n\ncharacteristics of various psychological disorders; and that his mental difficulties may have\n\nhad an organic basis. Bailey failed to request complete copies of the records that were\n\nmissing pages and he failed to request any records on his own. Additionally, counsel failed\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fto follow up with any of the potential witnesses interviewed by investigator Winbush. Also,\n\nBailey failed to do anything more than a brief, cursory telephone interview with Sadie Doss,\n\nwho was his sole mitigation witness.\n\n¶31.   Counsel’s performance was clearly deficient under Strickland. However, Doss must\n\nalso show that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense, i.e., but for counsel’s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id., 466 U.S.\n\nat 687. In Rompilla, the Court found:\n\n              The accumulated entries would have destroyed the benign conception\n       of Rompilla’s upbringing and mental capacity defense counsel had formed\n       from talking with Rompilla himself and some of his family members, and from\n       the reports of the mental health experts. With this information, counsel would\n       have become skeptical of the impression given by the five family members and\n       would unquestionably have gone further to build a mitigation case. Further\n       effort would presumably have unearthed much of the material postconviction\n       counsel found, including testimony from several members of Rompilla’s\n       family, whom trial counsel did not interview.\n\nRompilla, 545 U.S. at 391. The Court then summarized the evidence that would have been\n\nunearthed, including that Rompilla’s parents were both severe alcoholics, that his mother\n\ndrank during pregnancy, and that his father had a vicious temper and often beat both the\n\nmother and Rompilla. The Court also noted the evidence uncovered by Rompilla’s post-\n\nconviction counsel, specifically, that Rompilla suffered from organic brain damage, that his\n\nproblems related back to his childhood and that they were likely caused by fetal alcohol\n\nsyndrome. With regard to the prejudice prong of Strickland, the Rompilla Court said:\n\n             This evidence adds up to a mitigation case that bears no relation to the\n       few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury, and although we\n       suppose it is possible that a jury could have heard it all and still have decided\n       on the death penalty, that is not the test. It goes without saying that the\n       undiscovered “mitigating evidence, taken as a whole, ‘might well have\n\n                                              24\n\f       influenced the jury’s appraisal’ of [Rompilla’s] culpability,” Wiggins v. Smith,\n       539 U.S. [510], at 538, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471, 123 S. Ct. 2527 (quoting Williams\n       v. Taylor, 529 U.S. [362], at 398, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120 S. Ct. 1495), and the\n       likelihood of a different result if the evidence had gone in is “sufficient to\n       undermine confidence in the outcome” actually reached at sentencing,\n       Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052.\n\nId. at 393. If Doss’ trial counsel had reviewed the records provided by the public defender’s\n\noffice in Shelby County and had followed up with potential witnesses, he would have\n\nuncovered mitigating evidence almost identical to that in Rompilla.\n\n¶32.   Pursuant to the Rompilla, Wiggins, and Williams cases cited above, the mitigation\n\nevidence discovered by Doss’ post-conviction counsel, “taken as a whole, might well have\n\ninfluenced the jury’s appraisal of Doss’ culpability, and the likelihood of a different result\n\nif the evidence had gone in is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome actually\n\nreached at sentencing.” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393. Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit\n\nCourt of Grenada County denying post-conviction relief is reversed, and this matter is\n\nremanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate the death sentence and to grant Doss\n\na new sentencing hearing.\n\n                                        PART TWO\n\n       LAMAR, JUSTICE, FOR THE COURT:\n\nII. WHETHER THE DECISION IN ATKINS V. VIRGINIA REQUIRES THAT THE\nDEATH SENTENCE IN THIS CASE BE SET ASIDE.\n\n¶33.   In his request for post-conviction relief filed in 2003 with this Court, Doss alleged that\n\nhis death sentence would violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against the execution\n\nof the mentally retarded. See Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153 L. Ed.\n\n2d 335 (2002). Doss relied on a neuropsychological evaluation performed by Dr. Michael\n\n                                              25\n\fGelbort and the affidavits of Dr. James Merikangas, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Eno, a clinical\n\nsocial worker. This Court found that “Doss has more than met the threshold requirement to\n\nbe heard on the Atkins issue” and granted Doss leave to present his Atkins claim before the\n\ntrial court. In so finding, this Court relied on its decision in Chase v. State, 873 So. 2d 1013\n\n(Miss. 2004), wherein this Court attempted to clarify the application of Atkins v. Virginia\n\nin the trial courts of this state. In Atkins, the Supreme Court set forth two, almost identical,\n\ndefinitions of mental retardation.5 Atkins, 536 U.S. at 309 n.3. These definitions were\n\n\n       5\n     The first definition was provided by the American Association on Mental Retardation\n(AAMR):\n\n       “Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.\n       It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing\n       concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following\n       applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, community use, self-\n       direction, health and safety, functional academics, and work. Mental\n       retardation manifests before age 18.”\n\nAtkins, 536 U.S. at 309 n.3 (quoting Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and\nSystems of Support 5 (9th ed. 1992)).\n\nThe second definition was provided by the American Psychiatric Association:\n\n       “The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage\n       general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by\n       significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following\n       skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills,\n       use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work,\n       leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B). The onset must occur before age 18\n       years (Criterion C). Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may\n       be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that\n       affect the functioning of the central nervous system.” Diagnostic and\n       Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 39 (4th ed. 2000). “Mild” mental\n       retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 55-75 to\n       approximately 70. Id., at 42-43.\n\n\n                                              26\n\fadopted by this Court in Foster v. State, 848 So. 2d 172, 175 (Miss. 2003), and further\n\nexamined in Chase v. State, 873 So. 2d 1013, 1029 (Miss. 2004). Both definitions of mental\n\nretardation require not only significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, but also related\n\nor significant limitations in adaptive skills that occur before age eighteen. Atkins, 536 U.S.\n\nat 309 n.3. All three factors, (1) significant subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) related\n\nor significant limitations in adaptive skills, and (3) manifestation before age 18, must be met\n\nin order for the offender to be classified as mentally retarded and eligible for Atkins\n\nprotection from execution. Id.\n\n¶34.   The case sub judice exemplifies what the Atkins majority recognized, that “[t]o the\n\nextent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders, it is\n\nin determining which offenders are in fact retarded. . . . Not all people who claim to be\n\nmentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded\n\noffenders about whom there is a national consensus.” Id. at 317. In examining the scope of\n\nAtkins, our Court has recognized that “Atkins exempts all mentally retarded persons–even\n\nthose who are minimally mentally retarded–from execution . . . .” Chase v. State, 873 So. 2d\n\n1013, 1026 (Miss. 2004). With recognition of the difficulty in “determining which offenders\n\nare in fact retarded[,]” the Supreme Court left to the states “the task of developing\n\nappropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction” on the execution of sentences.\n\nAtkins, 536 U.S. at 317. Unlike many states, our state Legislature has not chosen to address\n\n\n\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\fthe issue of mental retardation in the context of death-penalty litigation. Unless and until it\n\ndoes so act, we are bound to provide guidance to our trial courts and to apply the\n\nconstitutional mandates of Atkins.\n\n¶35.   Following remand by this Court, the Grenada County Circuit Court in July 2004\n\nordered that Doss be sent to the Mississippi State Hospital (“Whitfield”) for a forensic mental\n\nhealth evaluation to assist the circuit court in determining whether Doss was mentally\n\nretarded as defined in Atkins and Chase. Doss was examined at Whitfield by Drs. Gilbert\n\nMacVaugh III, Criss Lott, John Montgomery, and Reb McMichael (“Whitfield doctors”) in\n\nNovember 2005. According to Dr. Lott, the Whitfield doctors found, to a reasonable degree\n\nof psychological and psychiatric certainty, that Doss was not mentally retarded as set forth\n\nin Atkins and Chase.6 They specifically concluded that Doss had an overall IQ score of 70 7\n\nand was in the borderline range of intellectual functioning. The evaluation stated that Doss’\n\ntrue IQ score may have been higher, but possible malingering or fatigue may have factored\n\ninto the scoring.\n\n¶36.   The evaluation further stated that Doss did not have a history of significant deficits\n\nin adaptive functioning due to intellectual limitations. The evaluation noted that Doss had\n\nworked, cared for himself, and met his own basic needs, and had shown no signs of\n\nsignificant deficits as far as social/interpersonal skills, communication, use of community\n\n       6\n         A report setting forth the findings of the Whitfield doctors was admitted into\nevidence through the testimony of Dr. Lott. While the trial court received testimony from\nDrs. Lott, MacVaugh, and McMichael, the report entered into evidence provides the findings\nof all the doctors; thus, we speak in terms of the report’s contents.\n       7\n      As the dissent aptly notes, the Whitfield Report lists a full-scale IQ score of 71.\nHowever, Dr. Gilbert McVaugh testified that the correct score is 70.\n\n                                              28\n\fresources or leisure activities were concerned. The evaluation stated that Doss’ suggested\n\nproblems in areas such as functional academics, work, self-direction, health, and safety were\n\nbetter explained by his chaotic upbringing than by intellectual deficits. The evaluation found\n\nthat Doss was “fairly adept in coping with the life demands for someone his age in that\n\nenvironment.”\n\n¶37.   Finally, the evaluation stated that, despite the presence of several risk factors for\n\nmental retardation, Doss had at least two prior psychological evaluations at the age of fifteen,\n\nneither of which resulted in a diagnosis of mental retardation. These evaluations found that\n\nDoss did not demonstrate deficits consistent with mental retardation prior to reaching the age\n\nof eighteen.\n\n¶38.   Doss also was examined by Dr. Daniel Grant in May 2005. Grant found that Doss’\n\ntest results were similar to test results obtained by other psychologists, which indicated\n\nconsistent effort and a lack of malingering. Grant found that, as the complexity of a task\n\nincreased, Doss’ level of performance decreased. Grant agreed with earlier findings of Dr.\n\nGelbort that Doss’ test results and past history were consistent with “neuropsychological\n\nimpairments and probable organic brain dysfunction” and were “likely both congenital and\n\nacquired at an early age.” Grant found that Doss’ IQ score of 71, recorded when he was\n\nfifteen, would actually be in the 66-to-67 score range when corrected. Grant found that the\n\ntests he had administered clearly placed Doss’ level of functioning within the mild mental\n\nretardation range of intelligence, and also showed significant impairments in adaptive-\n\nbehavior skills. Grant found that Doss’ test results were “consistent with the diagnosis of\n\nMild Mental Retardation as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\n\n\n                                              29\n\fDisorders Fourth Edition - Text Revision, Mental Retardation Definitions, Classification, and\n\nSupports, Tenth Edition published by the American Association on Mental Retardation and\n\nas described by the United States Supreme Court in the Atkins decision.”\n\n¶39.   Doss also was examined by Dr. Timothy Summers in July 2006. Summers did not\n\nperform any testing on Doss but relied on prior tests and reports by others. Summers found\n\nthat Doss was mentally retarded “as defined in Atkins v. Virginia as manifested by an IQ of\n\n71 and limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two areas of functioning significantly\n\nlower than his peers of equal age prior to the time that he was 18.” Summers further found\n\nthat Doss “meets the mental retardation criteria(s) as defined by the American Association\n\nof Mental Retardation, which defines mental retardation as an IQ between 70-75 as well as\n\nadaptional functional limitations described above along with identification of sub average\n\nintellectual functioning prior to age 18.” Summers found that Doss “experienced significant\n\nlimitations in his effectiveness in meeting the day to day challenges in learning, personal\n\nindependence and social responsibility.” Summers found that Doss was easily influenced\n\nand had poor social judgment regarding association with negative peer groups. Summers\n\nconcluded that Doss would likely be the least smart person in any peer group and had\n\nproblems with logic, foresight, strategic thinking, and understanding consequences.\n\n¶40.   The circuit court considered the expert testimony and lay witnesses presented by the\n\nparties and found that Doss had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he was\n\nmentally retarded. The circuit court found that the Whitfield doctors, who had determined\n\nthat Doss was not retarded, were more credible than Drs. Summers and Grant, who had found\n\nthat Doss was retarded. The record revealed that Dr. Grant had not administered any tests\n\n\n                                             30\n\fto show lack of malingering, as required by Chase.8 The court also found that Dr. Summers\n\ndid not test for malingering.\n\n¶41.   The circuit court noted that all of the examiners had opined that Doss met the first\n\nrequirement of mental retardation, that he displayed subaverage intellectual functioning, and,\n\nas a result, the court analyzed only the issue of deficits in adaptive functioning. The court\n\nnoted that Drs. Grant and Summers had made the required findings in this area to determine\n\nthat Doss was retarded. It further found that Dr. Grant had relied strictly on tests he had\n\nadministered to Doss and had spoken to no family members or other persons besides Doss.\n\nThe court found that the tests used by Grant had not been normed for prison populations. Dr.\n\nSummers made his finding based on his interview with Doss, affidavits from family\n\nmembers, and prior testing.\n\n¶42.   The circuit court noted that Drs. MacVaugh and Lott had interviewed Doss, numerous\n\nfamily members, and others who had observed him in the past. Doss was given two tests by\n\nthe examiners at the Mississippi State Hospital to assess malingering, one of which indicted\n\npossible malingering. The court noted that Drs. MacVaugh and Lott had determined that\n\nDoss did not have deficits in adaptive functioning, and that Doss had held legal jobs and had\n\nobtained money illegally, saved and spent his money, bought his clothes and prepared his\n\nfood, played sports, and engaged in personal relationships. The court found the Whitfield\n\ndoctors’ “approach and the methodology that they used is much more compelling than the\n\napproach used by experts offered by Doss.” The circuit court adopted the findings of Drs.\n\n\n\n       8\n         The court noted that Dr. Grant had assessed malingering in terms of consistency in\ntest-taking behavior, but that he had not administered a specific test to assess malingering.\n\n                                             31\n\fMacVaugh, Lott, and McMichael, and found that Doss had failed to prove, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that he was mentally retarded.\n\n¶43.   Doss argues that the circuit court erroneously rejected Dr. Grant’s finding of mental\n\nretardation because Dr. Grant failed to test for malingering as required by Chase. According\n\nto Dr. Grant, he determined that Doss was not malingering by the consistency of scores of\n\ntests taken in the past. While the circuit court certainly noted this action or inaction by Dr.\n\nGrant, this was not the only factor in its decision to reject Dr. Grant’s findings. Further, it\n\nwas an appropriate consideration for the court when reviewing the totality of the evidence\n\npresented.\n\n¶44.   Doss next argues that the circuit court erred in accepting the opinions of Drs.\n\nMacVaugh and Lott over that of Dr. Grant on the issue of adaptive functioning, even though\n\nDr. Grant was the only one to administer adaptive-functioning tests. Doss also argues that\n\nthe tenth edition of Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, Assistance, and Support,\n\nby the AAMR, specifically requires adaptive-functioning testing in order to determine mental\n\nretardation, and Dr. Grant’s opinion, which was based on the tenth edition of Mental\n\nRetardation and included such testing, was the only credible opinion given at Doss’ hearing.\n\nAs we will explain infra, these arguments are flawed for two reasons: (1) this Court has\n\nrecently held in Lynch v. State, 951 So. 2d 549 (Miss. 2007), that there is not one test to\n\ndetermine mental retardation, including the adaptive functioning component; and (2) there\n\nis no agreement among scholars or professionals as to the proper testing to be used in\n\nassessing adaptive functioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\f¶45.   This Court clarified the nature of testing for and defining mental retardation in Lynch\n\nv. State:\n\n       Accordingly, in Mississippi it is acceptable to utilize the MMPI-II and/or other\n       similar tests. Id. at 1029. This Court did not intend by its holding to declare\n       the MMPI-II or any one test as exclusively sufficient. Having a variety of tests\n       at their disposal, courts are provided with a safeguard from possible\n       manipulation of results and diminished accuracy which might result if courts\n       are limited to one test. The United States Supreme Court mentioned the\n       Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales Test. See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 309 n.5, 122\n       S.Ct. 2242. Other tests, as suggested by mental health experts, include the\n       Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS), the Validity Indicator\n       Profile (VIP), and the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM). See Douglass\n       Mossman, [Atkins v. Virginia]: A Psychiatric Can of Worms, 33 N.M.L. Rev.\n       255, 277-78 (Spring 2003).\n\n       The Court's interpretation in this case as to the proper test to be administered\n       with regard to an Atkins hearing supercedes any contrary decisions. This Court\n       neither endorses the MMPI-II as the best test nor declares that it is a required\n       test, and decisions that state otherwise are expressly overruled. See, e.g. Scott\n       v. State, 938 So. 2d 1233, 1238 (Miss. 2006) (holding that despite the doctor's\n       use of a battery of other tests, administration of the MMPI-II is required prior\n       to an adjudication of a claim of mental retardation); Goodin v. State, 856 So.\n       2d 267, 277 (Miss. 2003) (declaring that the MMPI-II is to be administered for\n       a determination of mental retardation since it is the best test to detect\n       malingering). Our trial courts are free to use any of the above listed and\n       approved tests or other approved tests not listed to determine mental\n       retardation and/or malingering by a defendant.\n\nLynch, 951 So. 2d at 556-57 (emphasis added). The trial court did not have the benefit of\n\nLynch, as it was decided after the circuit court issued its opinion on Doss’ mental retardation.\n\nThe Whitfield doctors followed Chase as this Court directed in Doss v. State, 882 So. 2d\n\n176, 190-91, 192 n.1 (Miss. 2004), and based their opinion on the ninth edition of Mental\n\nRetardation. Under Lynch, the experts who examined Doss and the circuit court were free\n\nto use or consider any approved test “to determine mental retardation and/or malingering by\n\na defendant.” Lynch, 951 So. 2d at 557.\n\n                                              33\n\f¶46.   Furthermore, the conceptualization of “adaptive behavior” or “adaptive skills” has\n\nproven elusive. Note, Implementing Atkins, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2565, 2573 (2003); Lois A.\n\nWeithorn, Symposium: Conceptual Hurdles to the Application of Atkins v. Virginia, 59\n\nHastings L.J. 1203, 1219 (2008) (“there is no single, commonly-accepted conceptualization\n\nof ‘adaptive behavior’”); see also Dora W. Klein, Categorical Exclusions from Capital\n\nPunishment: How Many Wrongs Make a Right?, 72 Brooklyn L. Rev. 1211, 1234 n.3 (2007)\n\n(noting that scholars and courts alike find that determinations regarding adaptive functioning\n\nare often subjective). There has been confusion not only about the concept itself, but also\n\ndisagreement as to its value. Note, Implementing Atkins, 116 Harv. L. Rev. at 2575. Some\n\nstudies have suggested that IQ remains the best way of measuring intelligence in some\n\ncontexts. Id.; see also James W. Ellis and Ruth A. Luckasson, Symposium on the ABA\n\nCriminal Justice Mental Health Standards: Mentally Retarded Criminal Defendants, 53 Geo.\n\nWash. L. Rev. 414, 422 n.46 (citing Zigler, Balla & Hodapp, On the Definition and\n\nClassification of Mental Retardation, 89 Am. J. Mental Deficiency 215, 227 (1984)) (noting\n\nthat three scholars have proposed that adaptive functioning be omitted from the definition\n\nof mental retardation because “‘the essence of mental retardation involves inefficient\n\ncognitive functioning’”).\n\n¶47.   Adaptive functioning historically has been assessed “on the inherently subjective\n\nbases of interviews, observations, and professional judgment.” Klein, 72 Brooklyn L. Rev.\n\nat 1235. In recent decades, researchers have developed an increasing number of test\n\ninstruments for quantifying adaptive functioning, only a few of which have gained\n\nacceptance in the field. Id.; Weithorn, 59 Hastings L.J. at 1220. These tests provide a\n\n\n                                             34\n\fnecessary objective measurement but offer no panacea. There are “no generally accepted\n\npsychometric instruments for measuring adaptive skill levels that are commensurate in\n\nreliability with IQ tests.” Note, Implementing Atkins, 116 Harv. L. Rev. at 2575 n.72 (citing\n\nAAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports, 24, 87-90\n\n(10th ed. 2002)) (noting that the AAMR concedes that there is no consensus regarding tests\n\nfor adaptive behavior, but states there are a number of tests with “excellent psychometric\n\nproperties”).   One commentator suggests that existing measurement instruments are\n\ninadequate and have very little utility in the Atkins context. Weithorn, 59 Hastings L.J. at\n\n1222.\n\n¶48.    By citing these controversies, we in no way suggest that this Court abandon the\n\nadaptive-behavior prong, or intimate that the tests for measuring adaptive functioning are\n\ninherently unreliable.     Our point is to illustrate that there is considerable, sincere\n\ndisagreement among professionals and scholars in the field as to the best method for\n\nmeasuring adaptive functioning. The concept and measurement of adaptive functioning is\n\nan unsettled area without consensus among experts and therefore, we cannot find that the\n\nWhitfield doctors’ opinions are baseless, or that the trial judge clearly erred in accepting their\n\nopinions.\n\n¶49.    We also find evidence which reasonably supports the trial judge’s conclusion that the\n\nopinions of the Whitfield doctors were more compelling. Although Dr. Grant tested Doss\n\nfor impairments in adaptive-skill behaviors, he spoke to no family members or other persons\n\nbesides Doss. Interviews with family members, and others familiar with an individual’s\n\ntypical behavior over an extended period of time in various settings, can supplement or aid\n\n\n                                               35\n\fin the interpretation of test results. Peggy M. Tobolowsky, Atkins Aftermath: Identifying\n\nMentally Retarded Offenders and Excluding Them From Execution, 30 J. Legis. 77, 98\n\n(2003) (using different sources of data is recommended rather than placing sole reliance on\n\nthe adaptive-skill assessment instrument); Linda Knauss & Joshua Kutinsky, Into the Briar\n\nPatch: Ethical Dilemmas Facing Psychologists Following Atkins v. Virginia, 11 Widener\n\nL. Rev. 121, 130-31 (2004). Additionally, testing instruments for assessing adaptive-\n\nfunctioning impairments can, for a variety of reasons, “be less than ideal for assessing adult\n\ncriminal defendants who might be mentally retarded.” Klein, 72 Brooklyn L. Rev. at 1235\n\n(citing certain problems such as the unavailability of caregivers or other reliable independent\n\nsources, the use of inappropriate norms, and the atypical environment of a prison); Knauss\n\n& Kutinsky, 11 Widener L. Rev. at 131 (“Few (if any) measures of adaptive functioning have\n\nbeen designed or normed for use with a correctional population. Thus, adaptive functioning\n\nprior to incarceration should be the target for assessment.”); Note, Implementing Atkins, 116\n\nHarv. L. Rev. at 2576 (noting that an individual’s environment may add a layer of\n\nuncertainty to diagnosing adaptive-skill deficits). Indeed, Dr. Lott stated that he knew of no\n\nstudies that have normed an adaptive-functioning test for those on death row, and Dr. Grant\n\nadmitted that the adaptive-functioning tests he administered were not normed for a prison\n\npopulation.\n\n¶50.   In sum, we have in this case experts who take opposite positions as to whether Doss\n\nis mentally retarded. Neither side’s methodology, approach, or understanding of the issue\n\nis infallible. The ultimate issue of whether Doss is, in fact, mentally retarded for purposes\n\nof the Eighth Amendment, is one for the trial judge, who sits as the trier of fact and assesses\n\n\n                                              36\n\fthe totality of the evidence as well as the credibility of witnesses. While expert opinions are\n\nhelpful and insightful, the ultimate decision of mental retardation is not committed to the\n\nexperts, but to the trier of fact. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, “the science\n\nof psychiatry, which informs but does not control ultimate legal determinations, is an ever-\n\nadvancing science, whose distinctions do not seek precisely to mirror those of the law.”\n\nKansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 413, 122 S. Ct. 867, 151 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2002).\n\n¶51.   The trial judge heard all the evidence and the expert opinions offered, and found the\n\nWhifield doctors to be more credible. The trial judge followed the procedures we set forth\n\nin Chase and concluded that Doss had failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that\n\nhe is mentally retarded. For the reasons set forth herein, this Court cannot say that the trial\n\njudge clearly erred in doing so. Accordingly, this Court affirms the circuit court’s judgment\n\nto the extent that it denied post-conviction relief based on Doss’ Atkins claim.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶52.   Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the Circuit Court of\n\nGrenada County is affirmed to the extent that it denied post-conviction relief based on Doss’\n\nAtkins claim. The circuit court’s judgment is reversed to the extent that it denied post-\n\nconviction relief based on Doss’ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty\n\nphase, and this case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate Doss’ death\n\nsentence and to grant Doss a new penalty phase sentencing hearing, consistent with this\n\nCourt’s opinion.\n\n¶53.   PART ONE: REVERSED AND REMANDED. PART TWO: AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f      PART ONE: WALLER, C.J., DICKINSON, KITCHENS, AND CHANDLER,\nJJ., CONCUR.

LAMAR, J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE WRITTEN\nOPINION JOINED BY CARLSON, P.J., RANDOLPH AND PIERCE, JJ.\n\n    PART TWO: WALLER, C.J., CARLSON, P.J., DICKINSON, RANDOLPH,\nCHANDLER AND PIERCE, JJ., CONCUR. GRAVES, P.J., DISSENTS WITH\nSEPARATE WRITTEN OPINION JOINED BY KITCHENS, J.\n\n       DICKINSON, JUSTICE, SPECIALLY CONCURRING:\n\n¶54.   I fully join Presiding Justice Graves’s excellent analysis of the first issue, and I agree\n\nthat this matter should be remanded for a new sentencing hearing. I write separately because\n\nof my concern that, in recent years, the acceptable standard for effective assistance of counsel\n\nin death-penalty cases has slipped to an unacceptably low level. See e.g. Byrom v. State, 927\n\nSo. 2d 709, 731-32 (Miss. 2006) (Dickinson, J., dissenting).\n\n¶55.   Although I have no personal reluctance in voting to affirm the death penalty in an\n\nappropriate case, I cannot do so where the defendant has not had reasonable (not necessarily\n\nperfect) representation and a fair trial; and particularly during the phase of the trial in which\n\nthe fact-finder decides whether or not to put the defendant to death.\n\n¶56.   Doss – who very well may deserve the death penalty – certainly did not have effective\n\nor reasonable representation during the penalty phase of his trial. I find it amazing that\n\nanyone might conclude otherwise, after reading the affidavit9 submitted by his trial counsel.\n\nI agree that we must remand for a new sentencing hearing on the question of whether Doss\n\nshould be executed or serve life without parole.\n\n\n       9\n           The content of the affidavit is set forth in detail in Presiding Justice Graves’s opinion.\n\n                                                  38\n\f       CHANDLER, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n       CHANDLER, JUSTICE, SPECIALLY CONCURRING:\n\n¶57.   I concur with the majority opinion authored by Justice Graves, holding that Doss\n\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel. I agree with the majority that Anthony Doss’s trial\n\ncounsel, Lee Bailey, rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance at the penalty phase of\n\nDoss’s trial because he failed to investigate all available evidence in mitigation. I write\n\nseparately to additionally express that, in my opinion, counsel’s performance was deficient\n\nbecause he did not obtain records from the Chicago Public School system that would have\n\nbeen generated when Doss was determined to be learning-disabled and placed into special\n\neducation classes. Had counsel obtained these records, he would have had access to\n\nfederally-mandated information from teachers, school officials, and Doss’s mother and\n\nstepfather quite possibly, regarding Doss’s behavior, homelife, intellectual capacity, and\n\nacademic functioning.\n\n¶58.   As established at the evidentiary hearing, Bailey obtained documents from Doss’s\n\npublic defender in Memphis. These documents included a copy of the public defender’s\n\nrequest for records from Faraday Elementary School in Chicago, which was attached to a\n\none-page copy of Doss’s registration card from the Chicago Public School system. This\n\nregistration card showed that Doss had been enrolled in the Chicago Public School system\n\nthrough the ninth grade. Bailey’s records from Memphis also included transcripts from\n\nMarshall High School, which showed that Doss had attended part of the ninth grade there,\n\nand that his last day was March 29, 1988. This was consistent with the evidence that Doss\n\nmoved from Chicago to Calhoun City, Mississippi, in March 1988.\n\n                                              39\n\f¶59.   The registration card shows that the last academic year that Doss attended Faraday\n\nElementary School was the 1986-1987 school year, when Doss was in the eighth grade. Doss\n\nturned fourteen in November of that school year. A handwritten note at the bottom of the\n\npage containing the copy of the registration card stated: “Anthony Doss received Learning\n\nDisabilities Resource Services while at Faraday. All of his school records were sent to\n\nMarshall High School including those Special Education Records. s/ [illegible], Counselor.”\n\n¶60.   According to the 1986 version of regulations promulgated by the United States\n\nDepartment of Education, beginning on October 1, 1977, before special education services\n\nwere provided to a child, a public agency was required to “have in effect an individualized\n\neducation program for every handicapped child who is receiving special education from that\n\nagency.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.342 (1986), see also Education for All Handicapped Children Act\n\nof 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-142, 89 Stat. 773 (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1461\n\n(1982)).   An “‘individualized education program’ means a written statement for a\n\nhandicapped child that is developed and implemented in accordance with §§300.341-\n\n300.349.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.340 (1986). The public agency was to make efforts to include\n\nthe child’s parents at meetings for the purpose of developing an individualized education\n\nprogram, along with teachers and other individuals. 34 C.F.R. § 300.344 (1986).\n\n¶61.   An evaluation of a handicapped child was to be conducted by “a multidisciplinary\n\nteam or group of persons, including at least one teacher or other specialist with knowledge\n\nin the area of suspected disability.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.532(e) (1986). The team was to assess\n\nthe child “in all areas related to the suspected disability, including, where appropriate, health,\n\nvision, hearing, social and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance,\n\n\n                                               40\n\fcommunicative status, and motor abilities,” and it was permitted to use tests for assessment\n\npurposes. 34 C.F.R. § 300.532(a),(f) (1986).\n\n¶62.   According to the counselor’s note, Doss received learning-disabilities services at\n\nFaraday. For a school-aged child suspected of having a specific learning disability, the\n\nevaluation team was to include the child’s regular teacher, or a regular classroom teacher\n\nqualified to teach a child of his or her age, and “at least one person qualified to conduct\n\nindividual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-\n\nlanguage pathologist, or remedial reading teacher.”      34 C.F.R. § 300.540 (1986). A\n\ndetermination that a child had a specific learning disability was governed by 34 C.F.R. §\n\n300.541, which stated:\n\n       (a) A team may determine that a child has a specific learning disability if:\n\n              (a)(1) The child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and\n              ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in paragraph (a)(2) of\n              this section, when provided with learning experiences appropriate for\n              the child’s age and ability levels; and\n\n              (a)(2) The team finds that a child has a severe discrepancy between\n              achievement and intellectual ability in one or more of the following\n              areas:\n\n                     (a)(2)(i) Oral expression;\n\n                     (a)(2)(ii) Listening comprehension;\n\n                     (a)(2)(iii) Written expression;\n\n                     (a)(2)(iv) Basic reading skill;\n\n                     (a)(2)(v) Reading comprehension;\n\n                     (a)(2)(vi) Mathematics calculation; or\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\f                     (a)(2)(vii) Mathematics reasoning.\n\n       (b) The team may not identify a child as having a specific learning disability\n       if the severe discrepancy between ability and achievement is primarily the\n       result of:\n\n              (b)(1) A visual, hearing, or motor handicap;\n\n              (b)(2) Mental retardation;\n\n              (b)(3) Emotional disturbance; or\n\n              (b)(4) Environmental, cultural or economic disadvantage.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.541 (1986). Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 300.543, an evaluation team was\n\nrequired to make a written report of the evaluation’s results, to include a statement of:\n\n              (b)(1) Whether the child has a specific learning disability;\n\n              (b)(2) The basis for making the determination;\n\n              (b)(3) The relevant behavior noted during the observation of the child;\n\n              (b)(4) The relationship of that behavior to the child’s academic\n              functioning;\n\n              (b)(5) The educationally relevant medical findings, if any;\n\n              (b)(6) Whether there is a severe discrepancy between achievement and\n              ability which is not correctable without special education and related\n              services; and\n\n              (b)(7) The determination of the team concerning the effects of\n              environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.543 (1986). All information used in making the determination had to be\n\ndocumented. 34 C.F.R. § 300.533(a)(2) (1986). Moreover, a reevaluation of a child was to\n\nbe conducted every three years, or more frequently if warranted or requested by the child’s\n\nparent or teacher. 34 C.F.R. § 300.534(b) (1986).\n\n\n                                             42\n\f¶63.   The United States Supreme Court in Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 382, 393, 125\n\nS. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2005), recognized that the school records of a defendant who,\n\nlike Doss, dropped out in the ninth grade, were one avenue counsel fruitfully could have\n\nfollowed to obtain mitigating evidence to meet the State’s case of aggravation. The Memphis\n\npublic defender’s file placed Bailey on notice that Doss had been designated as learning-\n\ndisabled while attending the Faraday school. As the applicable regulations make clear, had\n\nBailey obtained the associated documentation, he would have had access to a wealth of\n\ninformation about Doss’s childhood in Chicago which he could have used either as\n\nmitigating evidence, or as a lead for locating other mitigating evidence. The evidence\n\nunearthed by Doss’s post-conviction counsel about Doss’s impoverished living conditions\n\nin Chicago, his family’s abuse at the hands of Sam Brown, his mother’s alcohol abuse, his\n\nown early drug abuse, his low I.Q., and his psychological disorders hints at the helpful\n\ninformation this documentation was likely to have contained.10 In my opinion, Bailey’s\n\nfailure to obtain this documentation, despite his notice of its existence, constituted deficient\n\nperformance that combined with the other omissions cited by the majority to prejudice Doss.\n\n¶64.   Moreover, I am quite confident that Doss was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient\n\ninvestigation. As the majority recognizes, the missing mitigating evidence was very similar\n\nto that in Rompilla, such that, taking the evidence as a whole, it “might well have influenced\n\nthe jury’s appraisal of [Doss]’s culpability.” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393. However, my\n\n\n\n       10\n         I note the fact that Doss was determined to be learning-disabled indicates that his\nevaluators did not consider him to be mentally retarded. See 34 C.F.R. § 300.541(b)(2)\n(1986).\n\n\n                                              43\n\fconclusion that Doss was prejudiced is bolstered by the fact that Doss’s jury actually\n\nindicated its ambivalence during penalty-phase deliberations by sending a note to the judge\n\nstating: “To Judge: Do we have the option of ‘Life without parole’?” The note plainly shows\n\nthat the imposition of the death penalty was not a clear-cut decision for the jury. There is a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s failure to investigate the available mitigating\n\nevidence, the penalty phase would not have resulted in a sentence of death.\n\n       WALLER, C.J., AND DICKINSON, J., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n\n       LAMAR, JUSTICE, DISSENTING TO PART ONE:\n\n¶65.   I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that Doss received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel under the test set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052,\n\n80 L. Ed. 674 (1984). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n¶66.    In applying the test set forth in Strickland, “a court should keep in mind that the\n\nprinciples . . . do not establish mechanical rules . . . [and] the ultimate focus of inquiry must\n\nbe on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.” Id. at\n\n696. Under the first prong, “the defendant must show that counsel’s representations fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. at 688. In assessing reasonableness,\n\n“every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the\n\ncircumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s\n\nperspective at the time.” Id. at 689. Further, there is a strong presumption that counsel’s\n\nconduct was the result of sound trial strategy, and the reasonableness of an investigative\n\ndecision “is substantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or actions.” Id. at\n\n689, 691.\n\n                                               44\n\f¶67.   Under the prejudice prong, a “defendant must show that there is reasonable probability\n\nthat, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.”   Id. at 694.   To assess prejudice, the court must reweigh the evidence in\n\naggravation against the evidence in mitigation and determine whether “the balance of\n\naggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” Id. at 695; see Wiggins\n\nv. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 534, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003). Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt had to determine whether there was a reasonable probability that the jury would not\n\nhave imposed a sentence of death had it also heard the testimony and reviewed the evidence\n\npresented in 2006.\n\n¶68.   Under the proper standard of review, this Court cannot disturb the trial court’s factual\n\nfindings unless they are clearly erroneous. Loden v. State, 971 So. 2d 548, 572 (Miss.\n\n2007). This Court must give deference to the trial judge’s findings of fact, since he or she\n\nis the “‘sole authority for determining credibility of the witnesses.’” Id. (quoting Mullins v.\n\nRatliff, 515 So. 2d 1183, 1189 (1963)). I find that this Court has improperly reweighed the\n\nevidence presented at the PCR hearing, and further, that it has improperly reviewed evidence\n\nthat was not admitted before the trial court.\n\n¶69.   First, the majority provides a lengthy and unnecessary analysis of the affidavits\n\nattached to Doss’ motion for post-conviction relief.11 The affidavits of Lee Bailey and\n\nKelvin Winbush were never admitted into evidence before the trial court, and it is improper\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          As noted by the majority, I summarized some of the affidavits in my original\nopinion, Doss v. State, which is being withdrawn. Unlike the majority, I did not characterize\nthese affidavits as evidence, which they are not.\n\n                                                45\n\ffor this Court to consider them as evidence on appeal.12 Second, the Court fails to consider\n\nany of the aggravators presented at the first sentencing hearing, and as a consequence, its\n\nconclusion of prejudice lacks foundation from the record.\n\n¶70.   In 1993, the jury heard testimony from Frank Coffey, Sadie Doss, and E.J. Bobo.13\n\nCoffey testified that Doss had traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, after the murder of Bell, and\n\nthat Doss had committed a second murder in Memphis. Coffey confirmed that Doss had\n\nbeen convicted of second-degree murder. E.J. Bobo, an officer with the Calhoun Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment, testified that Doss had a bad reputation for peace and violence.\n\n¶71.   Sadie Doss testified that Doss had finished the ninth or tenth grade. She testified that\n\nthey had a “beautiful home,” and that Anthony was a “warm, beautiful person” who would\n\nprepare her food and help her when she was sick. However, Sadie also testified that she had\n\nrelied on welfare when Doss lived with her. She stated that Doss had suffered two serious\n\nhead injuries, one when he was eleven and one when he was seventeen. As to the effects of\n\nthe head injuries, she testified that “[Doss] would have headaches. Some days he won’t say\n\nnothing. Then, the next day, he talk.” On cross-examination, Sadie admitted that Anthony\n\nhad been convicted of second-degree murder in Tennessee.\n\n¶72.   At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the trial court presented the jury with the\n\nfollowing instructions as to aggravating and mitigating factors:\n\n\n       12\n          The trial court noted that Bailey’s 2006 testimony conflicted with his affidavit. At\nthe time Bailey signed his affidavit, he was unable to locate certain records or review Doss’\nfile, which he had given to Doss’ post-conviction- relief counsel.\n       13\n         All evidence that was admitted at the guilt phase was also reintroduced at the\nsentencing phase. See Doss v. State, 709 So. 2d 369 (Miss. 1996), for discussion of the\nunderlying facts of this case.\n\n                                             46\n\f       Consider only the following elements of aggravation in determining whether\n       the death penalty should be imposed:\n\n       1. The defendant, Anthony Doss, was previously convicted of another capital\n       offense or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\n       2. The capital murder of Robert C. “Bert” Bell was committed while the\n       defendant was engaged or was an accomplice, in the commission of armed\n       robbery.\n       3. The capital murder of Robert C. “Bert” Bell was committed for the purpose\n       of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest.\n       ...\n\n       Consider the following elements of mitigation in determining whether the\n       death penalty would [sic] not be imposed:\n\n       (1) The age of Defendant at the time of the crime.\n       (2) Loving and caring child to his mother.\n       (3) Grew up in poverty environment.\n       (4) Lack of significant father figure.\n       (5) Suffered head injuries which changed personality.\n       (6) The Defendant acted under extreme duress or under substantial domination\n       of another person.\n       (7) The Defendant was an accomplice in the capital offense committed by\n       another person and his participation was relatively minor.\n       (8) Went into store with gun that wouldn’t fire.\n       (9) Lack of education.\n       (10) Intervened in [sic] behalf of Robert James.\n\nAfter weighing the aggravators and mitigators, the jury sentenced Doss to death.14\n\n¶73.   As the majority notes, the trial court conducted a PCR evidentiary hearing in 2006 and\n\nheard testimony from Lee Bailey, Q.T. Doss, Sadie Doss, Sandra Price, and Sam Phillips.\n\nContrary to the majority’s conclusion, I find that Bailey did perform a reasonable\n\ninvestigation for mitigation evidence. First, Bailey was in contact with the Capital Defense\n\nResource Group, which provided him with information regarding the defense of a death-\n\npenalty case. Bailey testified that he had utilized the materials provided to him.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n            The jury unanimously found that all aggravators existed beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                                               47\n\f¶74.   Bailey also testified that he had obtained school, mental health, and medical records\n\nfrom Carolyn Watkins, Doss’ public defender in Memphis, Tennessee.15 Bailey’s testimony\n\nreveals that the decision not to introduce these documents was strategic.16 The following\n\nexchange took place between Bailey and the State as to why he did not use these documents\n\nat the sentencing phase:\n\n       Q. There was a reason you didn’t want me [the prosecutor in the original trial]\n       to even know about that stuff at the time, wasn’t it?\n       A. Well, I mean it, it has some information about other acts by Anthony.\n       Q. Robberies.\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. As a matter of fact, he was being evaluated, according to him, because he\n       had committed robberies. And he had been sent to the youth court there for\n       robberies and drug treatment; is that right?\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. Also in the stuff that I never got at that time that is in the stuff that you did\n       seek and get it showed that he was tested and his test scores showed his IQ at\n       80; is that correct?\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. You didn’t want me to have that either, did you?\n       A. No.\n       ....\n\n       15\n            The record shows that Bailey contacted Watkins on three, separate occasions.\n       16\n          The undated Discharge Summary mentioned that Doss’ “legal problems stem from\nrobberies,” that he drank alcohol regularly, had tried other drugs, and that he had an\nestimated IQ of 80.\n       The 1988 Psychological Report stated that Doss had been placed on probation with\nthe Calhoun County Youth Court as a result of guilty pleas to breaking and entering,\npossession of marijuana, and causing a family disturbance. The report also stated that Doss\nhad robbed an elderly man in Chicago. It mentioned that Doss had primarily attended\nspecial education classes in Chicago, but had been mainstreamed into some regular classes\nin junior high school, where he had achieved some success. It stated that Doss wanted to go\nback to Chicago, and that he had a 71 IQ after testing. It further provided that Doss’ mental\ndifficulties might have an organic basis. The report made no mention of Sadie’s drinking\nproblems and the terrible existence she described in living with Sam Brown in Chicago.\n\n\n\n                                               48\n\f       Q. Okay. Now, and we’ve talked about this. It was furnished in discovery.\n       If all of this stuff that you had available to you had been presented, we would\n       have possibly been able to, in addition to what the jury heard, been able to\n       bring out that he had been charged with robberies. He had been charged with\n       selling drugs. He had been charged two days before this murder with shooting\n       someone else in Bruce. All of that stuff would have possibly been able to have\n       been brought out for the jury is that correct?\n\n       [objection to speculation; court allows questioning to continue]\n\n       Q. You know about all these other charges, don’t you, from the reports?\n       ...\n\n       A. It was available.\n       Q. You had your file at that time.\n       A. Yeah.\n\n¶75.   The majority also takes issue with the fact that Bailey failed to investigate the extent\n\nof Doss’ head injuries.     However, Bailey testified that further investigation was not\n\nwarranted, since Doss could clearly communicate with him and was competent to stand trial.\n\nBailey stated:\n\n       In talking with Anthony – I mean I spent some time talking with him. And I\n       didn’t – I didn’t see where Anthony had a problem discussing this case with\n       me. He told me everything about it. He explained how he grew up. I\n       remember taking down notes about his early life . . . . I remember talking to\n       him about different aspects of the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\f¶76.   Bailey also relied in part on Doss and Sadie 17 to provide names of potential witnesses\n\nto testify at the sentencing hearing. Bailey testified that he had “no reason to believe that\n\nthere was anyone in Chicago that could help Anthony Doss.” Doss and Sadie provided only\n\nthe name of one witness, Mark Hendricks, the Chief of Police in Derma, Mississippi. Doss\n\nworked for Hendricks as a confidential informant on drug cases. Bailey wanted to introduce\n\nthis testimony, but if Hendricks had testified, the State was prepared to cross-examine\n\nHendricks on several criminal violations involving Doss. While Bailey filed a motion in\n\nlimine to exclude this testimony, the trial court denied it.\n\n¶77.   Bailey also obtained court funds to hire an investigator, Kelvin Winbush. Winbush\n\nlocated and interviewed seven potential witnesses: Lillie Moore, Doss’ aunt; Coach Smith,\n\nDoss’ former physical education teacher; Marvin Joe Doss, Doss’ brother; Randy Doss,\n\nDoss’ brother; Lucretian Monger, Doss’ sister; and Mavis McCaster, Doss’ sister. Bailey\n\ndecided not to use them as witnesses, since their testimony would not have been mitigating.\n\n¶78.   The majority also argues that a proper investigation would have yielded the testimony\n\nof Q.T. Doss, Sandra Price, and Sam Phillips, in addition to the expanded testimony of Sadie\n\nDoss. Q.T. Doss, Doss’ cousin, testified that they had spent time together and had done yard\n\n\n\n       17\n           The majority incorrectly states that Bailey spoke only once with Sadie via\ntelephone. Bailey testified: “I had several – I had telephone calls. I say several. I don’t\nthink there was but maybe one or two on my timesheet, but I know I talked to her more times\nthan that by telephone.”\n       The majority also concludes that Bailey failed to elicit personal information from\nSadie at the first sentencing hearing. His failure to question Sadie as to the information that\nshe testified to in 2006 was a direct consequence of her failure to provide that information\nto him. In reviewing the mitigating instruction submitted at the first sentencing hearing, as\nwell as Sadie’s testimony, it is evident that Bailey did in fact try to solicit personal\ninformation that is crucial at the sentencing phase.\n\n                                              50\n\fwork together when Doss visited Mississippi, and later when Doss moved back from Chicago\n\nas a teenager. Q.T. stated that Doss was a quiet person and a follower, not a leader. Q.T.\n\ntestified that Doss eventually had begun to hang around with Frederick Bell, and Q.T. felt\n\nthat Bell was a bully and troublemaker. Q.T. testified that Doss knew how to defend himself,\n\nbut Q.T. was unaware of Doss having a gun.\n\n¶79.     At the 2006 hearing, Sadie testified that she had drank alcohol regularly when she was\n\npregnant with Doss, that she had contracted gonorrhea at around that time, and Sam Brown\n\nhad beaten her to the point that she had almost miscarried. She testified that other members\n\nof her family had suffered from mental problems. Sadie stated that she did not tell strangers\n\nabout these problems, and that Bailey did not ask anything about the private details of her\n\nlife.\n\n¶80.     Sandra Price testified that Sam Brown was her father and that she had lived with\n\nBrown, Sadie, and Doss in Chicago. Price confirmed at the 2006 hearing the brutal treatment\n\nthe family had received from Sam Brown, who was also a drug user. She stated that Doss\n\nwas a quiet person who generally stayed to himself. Price also testified that the family had\n\nlived in a neighborhood where gang activity and violence were common. Sandra denied that\n\nshe had seen Sadie abuse alcohol or drugs. She testified that in 1989, she had been raped and\n\nbeaten by a gang of men who broke into their residence, and that Doss also had been beaten\n\nby these intruders. The State suggested that the attack was in retaliation for Doss’ selling\n\ndrugs.\n\n¶81.     Sam Phillips testified at the 2006 hearing that he was the biological father of Anthony\n\nDoss and that he and Sadie had never married. Phillips also testified that he had raised two\n\n\n                                               51\n\fchildren who had never been in trouble with the law. Phillips further testified that he had\n\nrepeatedly told Doss to stop selling drugs and leave the streets.\n\n¶82.   The trial court concluded that Bailey had provided effective assistance of counsel to\n\nDoss. The court summarized Bailey’s testimony and concluded that Bailey was not to blame\n\nfor Doss and Sadie’s “lack of forthrightness.” The circuit court also found that Lee Bailey\n\nhad no trouble communicating with Doss, and Doss did not appear to be insane. The court\n\nalso noted that at the time of Doss’ trial, execution of the mentally retarded was not\n\nprohibited. The circuit court found that nothing in the records indicated that Doss was\n\nmentally retarded, or that Bailey should have consulted a mental-health expert.\n\n¶83.   The trial court was presented with conflicting testimony from Sadie. Her testimony\n\non alcohol abuse and mental problems contradicted her 1993 testimony and the information\n\nthat she had provided in the 1988 Psychological Report. Furthermore, Sandra Price testified\n\nthat Sadie did not drink or abuse drugs. The court concluded that “a mother’s testimony\n\nwould be somewhat suspect and totally biased in favor of her child facing the death penalty.”\n\n¶84.   As for Sandra Price’s testimony, the trial court found that the sympathy that she may\n\nhave generated for Doss would have been offset by her testimony that she believed Doss had\n\nnot murdered anyone. Further, the court also found that the jury would have been concerned\n\nby her testimony that Doss’ actions may have triggered the home invasion.\n\n¶85.   The trial court also found that the testimony of Q.T. Doss and Sam Phillips would not\n\nhave swayed the jury to impose a sentence other than death. The trial court concluded that\n\nQ.T. Doss’ testimony “would have indicated to the jury that Anthony was making a\n\nconscious decision to associate with persons of bad character.” The trial court also found\n\n\n                                             52\n\fthat Phillips’s testimony that Anthony would have been better off raised in his household was\n\npure speculation.\n\n¶86.   After reviewing the evidence presented at the 2006 hearing, the trial court concluded\n\nin a thorough, thirty-seven-page opinion that the jury still would have sentenced Doss to\n\ndeath. After reviewing the record, I cannot say that the trial court’s findings of fact are\n\nclearly erroneous. Bailey certainly undertook a reasonable investigation that yielded little\n\nmitigation evidence. Doss and Sadie (along with the seven family members when Winbush\n\ninterviewed) failed to disclose any details of Doss’ life in Chicago, and Doss failed to exhibit\n\nany mental deficiencies. Under Strickland, the “reasonableness of an investigative decision\n\n“is substantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or actions.” Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 689, 691.\n\n¶87.   Furthermore, I do not find that there is a reasonable probability that, but for Bailey’s\n\n(alleged) errors, the outcome would have been different. While the evidence presented in\n\n2006 would have garnered some sympathy, it also would have acted as a double-edged sword\n\nby referencing Doss’ propensity for violence and substance abuse. See Burger v. Kemp, 483\n\nU.S. 776, 791-95 107 S. Ct. 3114, 97 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1987). Furthermore, the majority\n\naffords no deference to the trial court’s findings of fact, and in my opinion, has improperly\n\nreweighed the evidence to conclude with hindsight that Doss received ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel. I would affirm the trial court’s judgment that Doss received effective assistance\n\nof counsel at the penalty phase of this trial.\n\n       CARLSON, P.J., RANDOLPH AND PIERCE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n\n       GRAVES, PRESIDING JUSTICE, DISSENTING TO PART TWO:\n\n                                                 53\n\fII. WHETHER THE DECISION IN ATKINS v. VIRGINIA REQUIRES THAT THE\nDEATH SENTENCE IN THIS CASE BE SET ASIDE.\n\n¶88.   The majority of this Court relies on an incomplete and admittedly partially inaccurate\n\nreport from the State Hospital at Whitfield (the Whitfield Report) to find that Anthony Doss\n\nis not mentally retarded pursuant to Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153\n\nL. Ed. 2d 335 (2002).18 Because I would find that the evidence in this case clearly requires\n\na finding that Doss is mentally retarded, I respectfully dissent.\n\n¶89.   The majority acknowledges in footnote 6 that it is “speaking in terms of the report’s\n\ncontents,” despite testimony offered to correct, clarify and complete the report. Further, this\n\nreport clearly states that it was written without the experts being able to contact numerous\n\npeople and without benefit of substantial, relevant information.            The report says:\n\n“[H]owever, these attempts were unsuccessful at the time this report was written. Although\n\nwe requested more complete school records for Mr. Doss, the psychological testing report\n\nand raw data from North Mississippi Medical Center, and the raw data from a prior\n\npsychological evaluation by Dr. Gelbort, we had not received those records at the time this\n\nreport was written.” The report later says: “However, this opinion is limited by a lack of\n\navailable records related to Mr. Doss’ school history and other prior intellectual assessments,\n\nas well as obstacles encountered when attempting to assess adaptive functioning in\n\nindividuals who have been on death row for an extended period of time.” I write separately\n\n\n\n\n       18\n         The Whitfield Report finds that Doss obtained a full scale IQ score of 71. However,\nDr. Gilbert McVaugh conceded at trial that he made a scoring error and that the correct full-\nscale score should have been 70.\n\n                                              54\n\fbecause I submit that an analysis of the entire record and applicable law is necessary to\n\ndecide this issue.\n\n¶90.   In Chase v. State, 873 So. 2d 1013 (Miss. 2004), this Court clarified the application\n\nof Atkins in the trial courts as follows:\n\n               The Atkins majority cited, with approval, two specific, almost identical,\n       definitions of \"mental retardation.\" The first was provided by the American\n       Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR):\n\n                      Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in\n              present functioning. It is characterized by significantly\n              subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with\n              related limitations in two or more of the following applicable\n              adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, community use,\n              self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure,\n              and work. Mental retardation manifests before age 18.\n\n       Atkins, 536 U.S. at 308 n.3, citing Mental Retardation: Definition,\n       Classification, and Systems of Support 5 (9th ed. 1992). The second was\n       provided by The American Psychiatric Association:\n\n                      The essential feature of Mental Retardation is\n              significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\n              (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in\n              adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas:\n              communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal\n              skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional\n              academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B).\n              The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C). Mental\n              Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a\n              final common pathway of various pathological processes that\n              affect the functioning of the central nervous system.\" Diagnostic\n              and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 39 (4th ed. 2000).\n\n       Id.\n\n              The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, from which\n       the American Psychiatric Association definition is quoted, further states that\n       \"mild\" mental retardation is typically used to describe persons with an IQ level\n       of 50-55 to approximately 70. Id. at 42-43. The Manual further provides,\n\n                                              55\n\fhowever, that mental retardation may, under certain conditions, be present in\nan individual with an IQ of up to75. [n.18] Id. at 40. Additionally, according\nto the Atkins majority, \"it is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the\npopulation has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically\nconsidered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental\nretardation definition.\" Id. citing 2 Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive\nTextbook of Psychiatry 2952 (B. Sadock & V. Sadock eds 7th ed. 2000)\n(emphasis added).\n\n       n.18 This point is conceded by the State. However, IQ, alone,\n       does not determine mental retardation. According to the DSM-\n       IV, \"it is possible to diagnose Mental Retardation in individuals\n       with IQ's between 70 and 75 who exhibit significant deficits in\n       adaptive behavior. Conversely, Mental Retardation would not be\n       diagnosed in an individual with an IQ lower than 70 if there are\n       no significant deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning.\n\n       These definitions were previously adopted and approved by this Court\nin Foster v. State, 848 So. 2d 172 (Miss. 2003). This Court further held in\nFoster that the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-II (MMPI-II) is\nto be administered since its associated validity scales make the test best suited\nto detect malingering. . . .

The defendant is mentally retarded, as that term is\n              defined by the American Association on Mental Retardation\n              and/or The American Psychiatric Association;\n\n                      2. The defendant has completed the Minnesota Multi\n              phasic Personality Inventory-II (MMPI-II) and/or other similar\n              tests, and the defendant is not malingering.\n\n              Such expert must be a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, qualified\n       as an expert in the field of assessing mental retardation, and further qualified\n       as an expert in the administration and interpretation of tests, and in the\n       evaluation of persons, for purposes of determining mental retardation.\n\n              Upon meeting this initial requirement to go forward, the defendant may\n       present such other opinions and evidence as the trial court may allow pursuant\n       to the Mississippi Rules of Evidence.\n\n              Thereafter, the State may offer evidence, and the matter should proceed\n       as other evidentiary hearings on motions.\n\n               At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court must determine whether\n       the defendant has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n       defendant is mentally retarded.

Doss underwent a psychological evaluation at the University of Mississippi in 1988\n\npursuant to a youth-court proceeding. Despite the majority’s assertion that “Doss had at least\n\n\n                                                 57\n\ftwo prior psychological evaluations at the age of fifteen, neither of which resulted in a\n\ndiagnosis of mental retardation,” the record indicates that Doss was “to be evaluated for\n\npossible drug problems which may be contributing to his behavior” and not for the purpose\n\nof determining if he was mentally retarded pursuant to Atkins. More significantly, despite\n\nthe majority’s statement that “[t]hese evaluations found that Doss did not demonstrate\n\ndeficits consistent with mental retardation . . . ,” there was absolutely no finding that Doss\n\nis not mentally retarded pursuant to Atkins. Notwithstanding the purpose for which Doss\n\nwas evaluated, the report from this evaluation indicated as follows: 1) On the Wide Range\n\nAchievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R), Doss achieved a sixth-grade level in Arithmetic and\n\nbelow a third-grade level in reading and spelling; 2) on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for\n\nChildren-Revised (WISC-R), Doss obtained a verbal scale IQ of 67, placing him in a\n\nmentally deficient intelligence classification, a performance scale of 80, placing him in a\n\nlow-average intelligence classification, and a full scale of 71, placing him in a borderline\n\nclassification of intelligence; 3) “The Bender Motor Gestalt Motor Test revealed that there\n\nmay be some organic basis to Anthony’s difficulties,” as Doss showed poor planning,\n\nperceptual difficulties, inattentiveness and a hurried approach to tasks; 4) the Millon\n\nAdolescent Personality Inventory (MAPI) revealed “no unusual test-taking attitudes that may\n\nhave distorted the MAPI results.” 19\n\n\n       19\n        Another IQ test was administered to Doss at North Mississippi Medical Center that\nproduced a result of 80. However, this test was administered just a few months after the\nUniversity of Mississippi test and was merely an estimated score based on a shortened\nversion of an exam. Dr. Criss Lott, who was contracted by the Mississippi State Hospital\nto assist in the evaluation of Doss, acknowledged that this test was not a true result. Lott\ntestified: “There could possibly be a practice effect there. It was also an estimated IQ. That\n\n                                             58\n\f¶92.   In 2001, Dr. James Merikangas executed an affidavit, which was attached to Doss’\n\napplication for leave filed with this Court, outlining the need for a neuropsychiatric\n\nevaluation on Doss and opining that the University of Mississippi report from 1988 suggests\n\norganic brain damage and mental retardation. Doss also attached the affidavit of Jeffrey Eno,\n\na clinical and forensic social worker, to his application for leave. Eno provided a life history\n\nof Doss, including prenatal history, exposure to lead paint chips, details of his violent,\n\nabusive upbringing in a dangerous area, physical injuries, substance abuse, and history of\n\nmental issues within the family.\n\n¶93.   In 2003, Dr. Michael Gelbort performed a neuropsychological evaluation of Doss at\n\nParchman, during which the following tests were administered: Wechsler Adult Intelligence\n\nScale-III, Wechsler Memory Scale-III subtests, Wide Range Achievement Test-III, Lateral\n\nDominance Examination, Strength of Grip, Trail Making Test, Category Test, items from the\n\nLuria Nebraska, and diagnostic interview with mental status testing. Gelbort’s report, which\n\nwas attached as an exhibit to his application for leave, indicated as follows:\n\n       Intellectual testing found Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores of 68,\n       79, and 71, respectively. These scores are virtually identical to those obtained\n       in the distant past and lend weight to the opinion that the patient put forth\n       appropriate effort, as well as that his intellectual functioning is in the\n       borderline mentally retarded range and that he qualifies, in terms of intellectual\n       impairment, for a diagnosis of Mental Retardation.\n\n\n\n\nis, they only gave four subtests. So it is not a full IQ. It wasn’t a full evaluation in terms of\nusing the full test itself. It was only four subtests.” Based on these factors and others\ntestified to at trial, the validity of this result is not reliable.\n\n\n                                                  59\n\fExhibit HH, Application for Leave to File Motion to Vacate Judgment and Sentence, 1999-\n\nDR-296 (May 20, 2003). Gelbort’s impressions were:\n\n       Consistent with the past test results, Mr. Doss presents with a Full Scale IQ\n       score between the second and third percentile qualifying him for a diagnosis\n       of Mental Retardation. A clinical social worker is collecting information about\n       Mr. Doss and investigating the other issues involved in making a definitive\n       diagnosis. In any event, the patient is showing clear and consistent\n       impairments in frontal lobe functioning and bilateral temporal lobe functioning\n       with notable impairments in reasoning, judgment, problem solving, and all\n       types of new learning and memory skills. Based on the current evaluation and\n       historical information reviewed, Mr. Doss does qualify and is diagnosed with\n       Organic Brain Dysfunction, also diagnosed as Cognitive Disorder NOS based\n       upon other nosological systems. The data and historical information reflect\n       that these deficits are likely both congenital and acquired at an early age,\n       predate the event for which he was tried and convicted, and were as readily\n       and easily observed and diagnosed at the time of his original trial as they are\n       at this point in time. They have a significant impact and effect on his behavior\n       with the patient having impairments in the abilities of problem solving and\n       reasoning, as well as anticipating the consequences of his behavior and\n       planning adaptively and effectively into the future because of his\n       neurocognitive impairments.\n\nExhibit HH, Application for Leave to File Motion to Vacate Judgment and Sentence, 1999-\n\nDR-296 (May 20, 2003).\n\n¶94.   While acknowledging the State’s questions concerning Doss’ claims, this Court\n\ngranted Doss leave to present his Atkins claim before the trial court. The trial court\n\nappointed the Mississippi State Hospital to make a determination of whether Doss is mentally\n\nretarded. Doss was examined by Drs. Gilbert MacVaugh III, Criss Lott, John Montgomery,\n\nand Reb McMichael in November 2005. At the evidentiary hearing, Doss called Dr. Lott,\n\nwho was contracted by the Mississippi State Hospital to assist in the evaluation of Doss, Dr.\n\nDaniel Grant, and Dr. Timothy Summers as witnesses. The State called Drs. MacVaugh and\n\nMcMichael, employees of the Mississippi State Hospital, as witnesses.\n\n\n                                             60\n\f¶95.   Doss was administered the Stanford Binet Fifth Edition test by Grant on May 5-6,\n\n2005. Doss’ full-scale IQ score was 62. Doss was administered the Wechsler Adult\n\nIntelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) during the evaluation at the Mississippi State Hospital\n\n(Whitfield) on November 2, 2005. Doss received a corrected full-scale IQ score of 70 on the\n\nWAIS-III, which is a standardized test of adult intelligence.\n\n¶96.   Experts for both the State and the defendant agree that Doss meets the first criterion\n\nof significantly subaverage intellectual functioning manifested before age eighteen.20 Lott\n\ntestified repeatedly that he agreed that the testing of Doss meets the first criterion, that Doss\n\nhas significantly subaverage intellectual functioning that was manifested before age eighteen.\n\nLott also testified that Doss had scored low consistently over the years with the exception of\n\nthe estimated IQ in 1988, which Lott acknowledged was not a true result. See supra note\n\n3. MacVaugh testified, in relevant part: “The, the range of scores on IQ test for mild mental\n\nretardation is approximately 70 to 50 to 55. So I think that is the range that we are talking\n\nabout here in Mr. Doss’ case.” MacVaugh also testified that Doss meets the intellectual-\n\nimpairment prong of Atkins. “But in a forensic context, particularly this case, with the\n\ncriteria set forth by Chase and Atkins, I think he does satisfy the cognitive or intellectual\n\n\n\n\n       20\n         Because there is no question that Doss meets the first prong of significantly\nsubaverage intellectual functioning, the majority’s discussion regarding malingering is\nunnecessary and irrelevant. Moreover, the majority’s statement that “[t]he evaluation stated\nthat [Doss’] true IQ score may have been higher, but possible malingering or fatigue may\nhave factored in the scoring,” is incomplete. While the report did say Doss’ score may be\nhigher, it also said Doss’ true score may be three points less, or 67. Testimony also indicated\nthat Doss’ score could be considerably less. Further, the report specifically said fatigue may\nhave factored into Doss’ score on one measure of malingered memory deficits, i.e., TOMM,\nbut also that Doss was cooperative and put forth a good effort.\n\n                                               61\n\fimpairment prong of Atkins. So I don’t – I think he does have mild mental retardation in\n\nterms of the intellectual impairment prong of the diagnosis.”\n\n¶97.   As Doss meets the first prong of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\n\nmanifested before age eighteen, the relevant issue is then whether Doss has related or\n\nsignificant deficits in adaptive functioning. Adaptive-skill areas are communication, self-\n\ncare, functional academics, community use, self-direction, health and safety, leisure, and\n\nwork. The record indicates that Doss does have related or significant deficits in adaptive\n\nfunctioning.21\n\n¶98.   Grant administered a standardized test to assist in a determination of Doss’ adaptive-\n\nskills functioning. Grant testified:\n\n       Q.      Okay. Okay. The – in terms of adaptive functioning what are your\n       conclusions about, about that issue?\n       A.      I feel that he has deficits at adaptive functioning.\n       Q.      Okay. In what areas?\n       A.      I looked at it from two different points of view. I looked at it from the\n       skills he has on the language area, his language skills are – showed significant\n       deficits. And his academic skills showed significant deficits. And those two\n       areas would fit within – would show – one way of showing that he met poor\n       adaptive behavior. As they said, two sets of deviations below the means in\n       those two areas.\n               And I also administered the adaptive – the independent living skills.\n       And the norms for that test for this group is – the means score is – the mean\n       age score is 34, which is what his age is. So I mean he had a score of – a full\n       scale score of 65.\n       Q.      Okay.\n\n\n\n\n       21\n         The majority discounts findings in the record that establish Doss’ adaptive-skills\ndeficits because these findings rely on interviews with Doss. However, the findings in the\nWhitfield Report substantially rely on interviews with Doss as well. Also, the findings in\nthe Whitfield Report rely on interviews with Sadie Doss, yet the report notes that Sadie has\npreviously been tested and received an IQ score in the mentally retarded range.\n\n                                              62\n\f       A.     And if you notice, he had some, some better scores, some lower scores.\n       And retarded individuals are no different than the rest of us. They have\n       strengths. They have weaknesses. And he had some strengths and some\n       weaknesses in different variables.\n       Q.     In the full scale standard score of 65, why does that lead you to\n       conclude he has got deficits in adaptive functioning?\n       A.     Because it’s more than two sets of deviations below the mean. It also\n       is consistent – these scores are consistent across all these variables. Almost\n       every test I gave him was within a few points of that score.\n       Q.     The number 65 here, is that on the adaptive – the independent living\n       scales test or the equivalent of 65 on an IQ test?\n       A.     Right. With 100 being average.\n\n¶99.   Grant further testified that Doss also had exhibited significant deficits with regard to\n\nfunctional academics, work, and communication. Moreover, Grant concluded that Doss\n\nsuffered from organic brain dysfunction, which could have been impacted by the head\n\ninjuries. Grant testified:\n\n       Impaired brain. He has problems with attention, problems with concentration.\n       He has nystagmus, moving of the eyes. He has a thin lip, peculiarity of the\n       nose, which is typical in people that have fetal alcohol syndrome. He has – he\n       has concrete thinking. He has problems with memory, problems with – his\n       reasoning was concrete.\n\n¶100. Summers also testified that Doss has significant deficits in adaptive functioning.\n\nSpecifically, Summers said:\n\n              Well, in my opinion, first of all, if you look at communication issues for\n       one, he certainly has adaptive deficits in communication primarily because\n       number one, he is inattentive. Number two, he is impulsive. Number three,\n       he is mistrustful. Number four, he has difficulty processing. Number five, his\n       general fund of knowledge is poor. Number six, he has difficulty with abstract\n       thinking. Number seven, his memory is poor, particularly his working\n       memory.\n              If you gave him a problem that involved his remembering a certain\n       amount, amount of information that he could later on use to render a decision,\n       he wasn’t able to do that. And his, his general – and then he would rush into\n       solutions very fast without really giving a lot of thought to it. So he was – he\n       was very difficult for me to understand him.\n\n\n                                              63\n\f             And so finally I had to just finally say wait a minute. Okay. This is\n       what we are here for. This is what I want you to focus on. This is what we are\n       going to talk about. And so he has significant problems as it relates to\n       communication. He thinks nobody loves him. He thinks nobody cares about\n       him. He thinks that –\n\n¶101. Summers also testified that Doss had significant deficits in academic functioning,\n\nabstract reasoning, social skills, and interpersonal relations, and that these deficiencies were\n\nrelated to his subaverage intellectual functioning.\n\n       Q.      Let me ask you this. Do the – you mentioned in your report some areas\n       of limitations and adaptive functioning. Do you, you believe those stem from\n       and are related to the subaverage intellectual functioning that was already\n       discussed?\n       A.      Absolutely. I mean – see, it doesn’t matter if your intellectual\n       functioning is low because you have head trauma or toxicity to your brain or\n       if your intellectual functioning is low because you lived in an impoverished\n       environment. The end result is still the same.\n               But in my opinion, you know, Anthony has had so much, so many\n       problems, so many issues to his brain. I mean he has had – I mean number\n       one, he started out with a mom who was drinking every day. Then number\n       two, she was kicked in the abdomen when she was pregnant to the point that\n       she bled so much that she had to go to the hospital.\n               Number three, when Anthony was a little boy then he had lead toxicity.\n       Then after that he had measles at two. And then after that he developed\n       multiple head trauma - baseball bats, sticks, hit in the head with a pistol.\n               So, you know, when you get through looking at all those different\n       issues then – now, in addition to that, you also have the psycho-social issues\n       that affect the brain.\n\n¶102. Lott testified that he did not use a standardized test to measure adaptive functioning,\n\nbut that he reviewed Grant’s report, which was based on a standardized test. Lott further\n\ntestified that it is very hard to assess what someone’s adaptive functioning was twenty years\n\nago. Lott discounted the use of the standardized test because he said there have been no\n\nstudies that norm the test for people on death row.\n\n\n\n\n                                              64\n\f¶103. Most significantly, Lott testified that he relies on the tenth edition of the AAMR\n\ndefinition, but not in this case.\n\n       Q.      I want to show you the book, 10th edition of the book called Mental\n       Retardation, Definition, Classification, Assistance and Support by the\n       American Association of Mental Retardation. Are you familiar with this\n       book?\n       A.      Yes.\n       Q.      Okay. Is it a book that you rely on?\n       A.      Yes.\n       Q.      Okay. I want to show you a page, eight, it’s called Assumption 1 and\n       just a couple of sentences. And I want to ask you about it. Limitations in\n       present functioning must be considered within the context of community\n       environments typical of the individual’s age, peers and culture. This means\n       the standards against which the individual’s functioning must be measured are\n       typically community-based environments, not environments that are isolated\n       or segregated by ability.\n               Doesn’t that suggest that it is unnecessary to norm a test for someone\n       in an environment that is isolated or segregated like a prison?\n       A.      Well, you would norm it. When you say it’s unnecessary to norm it, I\n       am not sure what you mean by not needed. We, we, we certainly rely on\n       norms. That is the way we interpret measures. It would not be appropriate for\n       us to use any test that had not been adequately normed.\n       Q.      Right.\n       A.      So I’m not sure exactly where you are going with that question.\n       Q.      In your report, at the bottom of Page 31, the very last paragraph, you,\n       you, you say that there is standardized assessment interests – assessment\n       instruments for measuring adaptive functioning. And then you go on to say\n       such instruments have not been standardized for use with offenders who have\n       been incarcerated for a number of years, particularly those on death row. Then\n       you go on to say that administration of a standardized instrument to measure\n       adaptive skills with a death row inmate would yield invalid results.\n               But given what the – what the AAMR says about the need to measure\n       someone in terms of the community at-large rather than segregated or isolated\n       environment, can’t a test like this yield valid results even though it has not\n       been standardized for use with people on death row?\n       A.      It would certainly be possible if you had adequate measures here and\n       adequate population for us to look at. It is very difficult, I think, to take a test\n       like this and to go into death row and ask someone there questions about a\n       defendant’s behavior. And they, they don’t have access. They have limited\n       access on death row to these kinds of activities and behaviors.\n\n\n\n                                               65\n\f               Are we assessing at 20? Are we assessing their deficits prior to the age\n       of 18? I think that is the issue here. What do they look like prior to 18?\n       That’s, that’s the criteria. They have to meet this deficit – these deficit areas\n       prior to the age of 18. Now, it still remains difficult. I think it is questionable\n       as to whether or not we can do that and how adequately and correctly we can\n       do that.\n       ...\n       Q.      But the fact that – I mean the fact that it was not normed on the people\n       on death row is not by itself important given the fact that it has been normed\n       with the general population, which is what the AAMR says is important; is that\n       correct?\n       A.      I think you are correct in that a test can be appropriate. For instance,\n       the IQ test that we all use, it wasn’t normed on death row inmates and we use\n       that routinely. It’s though how adequate that measure is in collecting or\n       obtaining information that you are looking for. An IQ test that we use for the\n       inmates on death row is the same IQ test I use in disability evaluations every\n       day. There is not a specific set of norms for those IQ, IQ results that I get just\n       for death row inmates.\n       Q.      Okay.\n       A.      Okay. I understand that, and I agree with you. The problem though is\n       getting reliable data. . . .\n               There are a number of tests that we would use that have been normed\n       elsewhere that aren’t normed for death row inmates, a number of them. It is\n       just taking that data that we obtained for this instrument and then interpreting\n       it. I think that remains a big problem in this area.\n\n¶104. Lott acknowledged that Doss’ history is significant for several risk factors that are\n\ncorrelated with the development of mental retardation, including childhood abuse; abuse of\n\nthe mother during pregnancy; social and cultural deprivation during infancy, childhood, and\n\ninto adolescence; the ingestion of lead paint; neglect; possible malnutrition; head injuries;\n\nand limitations in functional academics. However, Lott dismissed these factors as not related\n\nto Doss’ mental retardation.\n\n       Q.    Now, you said that on the surface Mr. Doss’s history might seem to\n       suggest he has demonstrated limitations in some areas of adaptive skills in the\n       community, i.e., functional academics, work, self direction, health and safety.\n       Now, if these things were not related to mental retardation, what were they\n       caused by?\n\n\n                                               66\n\f       A.    By growing up in an environment where one isn’t supervised, one isn’t\n       monitored, one isn’t nurtured, a lot of neglect and possible abuse.\n\n¶105. Lott acknowledged that limitations in these adaptive skills, even in a person who is\n\nnot mentally retarded, substantially impact a person and can affect judgment. Lott testified\n\nthat most of the basis for finding that Doss was not retarded came from unverified or\n\nunexplained information provided by Doss. Lott said that some of the information was\n\n“corroborated in part by family about his ability to maintain independent or close to\n\nindependent living, developmentally speaking, early on.” Lott specifically mentioned Doss\n\nhelping his mother when he was eight or nine years old. Sadie also testified that Doss and\n\nhis brother had helped her. However, the record does not establish that Doss did anything\n\nsubstantial to help his mother or anything that would establish that he had no deficiencies in\n\nadaptive skills before age eighteen.\n\n¶106. MacVaugh’s testimony was similar to Lott’s. MacVaugh dismissed Doss’ deficits in\n\nthe adaptive areas of functional academics and work because “we had enough data to suggest\n\nthat his apparent deficits in those areas were due to his personality attributes, his various\n\nbehavioral problems, substance abuse and other factors that together we would consider\n\nmaladaptive behavior, not adaptive deficit the way a mental retardation diagnosis requires\n\n. . . .” MacVaugh also discussed Doss’ apparent ability to work as a drug dealer. However,\n\ntestimony at trial established that Doss was merely following instructions of others and was\n\noften assisted by his brother. MacVaugh also offered the following testimony on the\n\nconfusion regarding the relationship of adaptive deficits to the significant intellectual\n\nimpairment:\n\n\n\n                                             67\n\f               Sure. We as clinicians, think, or at least on our service, maybe I\n       shouldn’t speak for my colleagues and should limit this to my own opinion\n       about this, really interpret the definition of mental retardation that consists of\n       the two prongs of intellectual impairment and adaptive functioning impairment\n       as being more than just coexisting. I mean there has to be some relationship\n       between those domains of impairment.\n               And really the, the view that we have taken in this in order to help us\n       understand this better because it is so difficult to assess, particularly someone\n       who has a history like Mr. Doss, who on the surface may look like they have\n       some of these adaptive deficits but with further analysis there are reasons why\n       that might better explain why they look that way historically.\n               The issue is whether or not these deficits in adaptive functioning are\n       due to the significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. This is an issue\n       that is very controversial. It has not been explicitly clear in any of the major\n       documents that we rely on in doing our evaluations. . . .\n               There is no national consensus about what the interpretation is about\n       that, what the approach is to the assessment on that point and that evaluators\n       do lots of different things. It is very variable in terms of how you are\n       approaching the issue. Are the deficits supposed to be due to the intellectual\n       deficits, or do they just somehow coexist?\n               My own view on that is the reason why it is not clear in the AAMR\n       definition or DSM definition is because when these definitions were written,\n       it was impossible to anticipate that these definitions would be under the\n       microscope in a death penalty case one day because these were written pre-\n       Atkins so there was no reason to make that explicitly clear that the intellectual\n       deficits are more than related to the adaptive deficits, that the adaptive deficits\n       should be due to the intellectual deficits.\n               For example, if somebody is leaving the stove on is it because they have\n       such a severe memory impairment because they forgot to turn it off? Now, that\n       is an example of self-care adaptive deficit that is due to a significant\n       intellectual deficit. Whereas if somebody has an intellectual deficit but, you\n       know, doesn’t show some related adaptive deficits related to the intellectual\n       impairments then I question whether that is actually adaptive functioning\n       deficits.\n\n¶107. The testimony of both Lott and MacVaugh was similar to the Whitfield report, which\n\nsaid, in part:\n\n       On the surface, Mr. Doss’ history might seem to suggest that he has\n       demonstrated limitations in some areas of adaptive skills in the community\n       (i.e., functional academics, work, self-direction, health, and safety). However,\n       it is our opinion that these apparent difficulties may be better explained by his\n\n\n                                               68\n\f       history of neglect, abuse and maladaptive behaviors, since they did not appear\n       to stem from severe intellectual deficits.\n\n¶108. The Whitfield report also said:\n\n              It is noted that Mr. Doss [sic] history is significant for several risk\n       factors that are correlated with the development of mental retardation. For\n       example, during her pregnancy with Mr. Doss, Ms. Doss reportedly abused\n       alcohol regularly, was prescribed valium (anti-anxiety medication), was\n       “kicked” in the stomach . . . leading to blood loss and hospital attention, and\n       reportedly contracted a venereal disease during pregnancy. Mr. Doss also\n       reportedly tested positive for lead poisoning due to exposure to chipping paint\n       as a child. Moreover, Mr. Doss reported (and medical records confirm) that\n       he also has had multiple head injuries over the years.\n\n¶109. The report then discounts these risk factors for mental retardation based on the prior\n\npsychological evaluations at the age of fifteen and on a ninth-grade class ranking. However,\n\nthe report previously acknowledged that Doss had scored in the borderline mentally retarded\n\nrange as an adolescent. Further, as stated previously herein, Doss was never evaluated as an\n\nadolescent for the purpose of determining whether he was mentally retarded pursuant to\n\nAtkins.     Moreover, while Doss was ranked 681 out of 850 students, the report also\n\nacknowledges that Doss passed only one out of five subjects that year, while failing the\n\nothers.22\n\n¶110. The Whitfield report further said that despite Doss’ IQ, his “apparent difficulties [in\n\nadaptive skills] may be better explained by his history of neglect, abuse, and maladaptive\n\nbehaviors, since they did not appear to stem from severe intellectual deficits.” (Emphasis\n\n\n\n\n       22\n        Records indicate Doss passed Pre-Algebra with Support, which apparently consisted\nof two separate classes, including one with individualized assistance by a special education\nteacher. Doss failed Introduction to High School English, General Science, Art, and\nPhysical Education.\n\n                                             69\n\fadded.) The report also said that “there were no data that suggested Mr. Doss has ever\n\ndemonstrated significant deficits in adaptive functioning due to the effects of subaverage\n\nintellectual functioning.” 23 (Emphasis added.) However, there is no requirement in the\n\ndefinitions set out previously herein that the deficits in adaptive functioning must be “due to\n\nthe effects of subaverage intellectual functioning,” much less that the adaptive deficits “stem\n\nfrom severe intellectual deficits.”\n\n¶111. The AAMR definition for mental retardation, as set out previously herein, states\n\n“significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related\n\nlimitations in two or more” adaptive-skill areas. Atkins, 536 U.S. at 308. The American\n\nPsychiatric Association’s definition, also set out previously herein, states “significantly\n\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning . . . that is accompanied by significant limitations\n\nin adaptive functioning in at least two” of the skill areas. Id. Also, as noted previously,\n\naccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, \"it is possible to\n\ndiagnose Mental Retardation in individuals with IQ's between 70 and 75 who exhibit\n\nsignificant deficits in adaptive behavior. Conversely, Mental Retardation would not be\n\ndiagnosed in an individual with an IQ lower than 70 if there are no significant deficits or\n\nimpairments in adaptive functioning.”\n\n¶112. In Rivera v. Quarterman, 505 F. 3d 349 (5th Cir. 2007), the Fifth Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals upheld the federal district court’s finding regarding related limitations in adaptive\n\n\n       23\n         The Whitfield report further states the “opinion is limited by a lack of available\nrecords related to Mr. Doss’ school history and other prior intellectual assessments, as well\nas obstacles encountered when attempting to assess adaptive functioning in individuals who\nhave been on death row for an extended period of time.”\n\n                                              70\n\ffunctioning despite the State’s argument that Rivera’s adaptive deficits may have been\n\nattributable to his abuse of inhalants and not to his mental retardation. In noting that the\n\ndistrict court had acknowledged that Rivera’s adaptive deficits were just as likely to have\n\nbeen caused by his long-term drug abuse as his diminished intellectual capacity, the Fifth\n\nCircuit Court said:\n\n              We read this quote charitably, in support of the district court’s own\n       ruling. The district court was likely distinguishing only between etiologies,\n       remarking that some of the deficits were caused by mental retardation from\n       inhalants, and some were caused by mental retardation from other factors.\n       Retardation has, as the experts in this case all agreed, a number of etiologies.\n\nRivera, 505 F. 3d at 363. The Court then quoted the applicable language from Atkins, as\n\nfollows: “Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final\n\ncommon pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central\n\nnervous system.” Atkins, 536 U.S. at 308 n.3.\n\n¶113. Clearly, mental retardation is: 1) subaverage intellectual functioning; 2) accompanied\n\nby related or significant limitations in two adaptive-skill areas; and 3) manifested before age\n\neighteen. Doss has significantly 1) subaverage intellectual functioning; 2) accompanied by\n\nrelated or significant limitations in two adaptive-skill areas; and 3) it manifested prior to age\n\neighteen. Therefore, the inescapable conclusion is that Doss is mentally retarded. Under the\n\napplicable law and based on the facts of this case, it would be illogical to reach any other\n\nconclusion.\n\n¶114. Moreover, the State’s experts testified that Doss was evaluated under the ninth edition\n\nof the AAMR pursuant to Atkins, and that they were under the mistaken belief that they were\n\nrequired to use this older definition of adaptive functioning rather than that contained in the\n\n                                               71\n\ftenth edition from 2002, which they used in their respective clinical practices. MacVaugh\n\nfurther admitted that using the more current tenth edition to evaluate Doss “could possibly\n\nchange the diagnosis because the assessment of adaptive skill deficits would, would look\n\ndifferent because the definition for them is different conceptually.” Therefore, even though\n\nthe majority finds that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of mental\n\nretardation, this matter still should be remanded for an additional evidentiary hearing to allow\n\nthe State’s experts the opportunity to re-evaluate Doss pursuant to the current definition of\n\nadaptive functioning.\n\n¶115. Because I would find that there is sufficient evidence to establish that Doss is mentally\n\nretarded or, in the alternative, that he should be re-evaluated pursuant to the tenth edition, I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n       KITCHENS, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n                                              72\n\f",

This\n         requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not\n         functioning as the “counsel” guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n         Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance\n         prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so\n         serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\n\nId. at 687.\n\n¶8.      The Court further established that “[t]he proper measure of attorney performance\n\nremains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.” Id. at 688. “The\n\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable\n\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694.\n\nWith regard to an attorney’s duty to investigate, the Court said the following in Strickland:\n\n                                                   4\n\f         These standards require no special amplification in order to define counsel’s\n         duty to investigate, the duty at issue in this case. As the Court of Appeals\n         concluded, strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts\n         relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic\n         choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely\n         to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on\n         investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n         investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular\n         investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision\n         not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the\n         circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgment.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91.\n\n¶9.      This Court has applied the Strickland standard numerous times and has further said,\n\n“an attorney’s lapse must be viewed in light of the nature and seriousness of the charges and\n\nthe potential penalty.” See Ross v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1595336\"><a href=\"/opinion/1595336/ross-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1004 (Miss. 2007) (citing State v.\n\nTokman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1707629\"><a href=\"/opinion/1707629/state-v-tokman/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1343 (Miss. 1990)). In Ross, defense counsel offered, as\n\nmitigating evidence during the sentencing phase, the testimony of Ross’ mother,\n\ngrandmother, and daughter, a minister from the jail, and a sheriff who had arrested Ross.\n\nThe testimony referenced Ross’ character, and the witnesses described Ross as a “good\n\nprisoner.” Id. at 1005. Counsel’s failure to investigate Ross’ inmate record led to the\n\nadmission of highly prejudicial evidence on cross-examination. Ross’ counsel also failed to\n\nconduct an adequate investigation into potentially mitigating factors, including Ross’\n\npsychological problems, and failed to obtain an expert to testify to these factors. This Court\n\nnoted:\n\n               While courts must defer to lawyers’ judgments and strategies, “at a\n         minimum, counsel has a duty to interview potential witnesses and to make\n         independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case.”\n         Ferguson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1100795\"><a href=\"/opinion/1100795/ferguson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (Miss. 1987). Under this standard,\n         counsel may be deemed ineffective for relying almost exclusively on material\n\n                                               5\n\f       furnished by the State during discovery and conducting no independent\n       investigation. Id. While counsel is not required to exhaust every conceivable\n       avenue of investigation, he or she must at least conduct sufficient investigation\n       to make an informed evaluation about potential defenses. State v. Tokman,\n       564 So. 2d at 1343.\n\nRoss, 954 So. 2d at 1005. This Court further said:\n\n       [C]ounsel will not be deemed ineffective if there is proof of investigation or\n       if there is no factual basis for the defendant’s claim. However, each of these\n       principles presuppose a certain level of investigation. By contrast, “strategic\n       choices made after less than complete investigation will not pass muster as an\n       excuse when a full investigation would have revealed a large body of\n       mitigating evidence.” . . . “It is not reasonable to refuse to investigate when\n       the investigator does not know the relevant facts the investigation will\n       uncover.”\n\nRoss, 954 So. 2d at 1006 (citation omitted).\n\n¶10.   In his application for leave filed with this Court in 2003, Doss relied on affidavits1\n\nfrom several people with various connections to him, including: Lee Bailey, trial attorney;\n\nKelvin Winbush, Bailey’s investigator; Carolyn Watkins, the public defender who handled\n\na separate murder charge against Doss in Shelby County, Tennessee; Sadie Doss, mother;\n\nVerlene Forest Williams, friend; Carolyn Phillips, aunt; Ernestine Williams, aunt; Lucretia\n\nMonger, sister; Randy Doss, brother; Roselyn Monette Jackson, aunt; Mary Jennings, aunt;\n\nJohn Westmoreland, formerly married to an aunt; Annette James, girlfriend; Marvin Doss,\n\n\n\n       1\n          Incredulously, in her dissent, Justice Lamar characterizes our analysis of the affidavits as\n“lengthy and unnecessary” and then says “it is improper for this Court to consider” the affidavits of\nLee Bailey and Kelvin Winbush because “they were never admitted into evidence before the trial\ncourt. . . .” However, Justice Lamar quoted these very affidavits at length in her previous majority\nopinion, which is now being withdrawn on rehearing. Moreover, we quote the published opinion\nof this Court, Doss v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1701984\"><a href=\"/opinion/1701984/doss-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miss. 2004), on Doss’ original application for leave and\nthe trial court herein regarding these affidavits, which were indeed filed. Further, the trial court\nspecifically discussed the affidavits in his Order and noted that he considered the affidavit of Lee\nBailey. Finally, there was no objection to the use of Bailey’s affidavit in the trial court.\n\n                                                  6\n\fhalf-brother; Q.T. Doss, cousin; Lillie Moore, aunt; Sandra Price, daughter of Sam “Joe”\n\nBrown, who lived with Doss’ mother in Chicago; Chantay Price, Sandra Price’s sixteen-year-\n\nold daughter; Varnado McDonald, step-sister of Lucretia Monger; Carrie Cole, aunt; Rosie\n\nCaldwell, friend of Doss’ mother; and Sam Phillips, biological father.\n\n¶11.   With regard to the affidavit of defense counsel Lee Bailey, this Court summarized:\n\n               Doss relies first on the affidavit of his trial attorney who states that:\n       Doss’ was the first case he had defended where the death penalty was sought;\n       he did not seek any school, medical, mental health or other records, because\n       he did not realize the importance of the records in presenting a defense during\n       the sentencing phase; he did not seek advice from a mental health expert, funds\n       for a mental health expert or any kind of mental health evaluation; and he did\n       not obtain any records resulting from the investigation of criminal charges\n       against Doss in Shelby County, but he did obtain the indictment and judgment\n       in that case. Bailey also obtained the appointment of an investigator, Kelvin\n       Winbush, who was also the investigator for Doss’ co-defendant, Frederick\n       Bell. Bailey stated that Winbush told him he had interviewed: Doss’ aunt,\n       Lillie Moore, Doss’ sisters, Lucretia Monger and Mavis McCaster; Doss’\n       brothers, Marvin Doss and Randy Doss; and John Westmoreland and that all\n       stated that Doss was a good and/or quiet person who got involved with the\n       wrong crowd. Bailey did not follow up with these witnesses or ask them to\n       testify at the sentencing phase. Bailey stated that Winbush told him he had\n       contacted two teachers in Bruce, a Mrs. Parker and a Coach Smith, but it was\n       questionable as to whether these people actually knew Doss, or whether they\n       had mistaken him for Frederick Bell. Bailey did not realize that a conflict\n       might result from using Winbush, where one of Bailey’s potential defense\n       strategies was to blame Bell as the instigator of the shooting. Bailey states that\n       he interviewed only Doss’ mother and an aunt for a few minutes. Bailey states\n       that he felt he did a good job in defending the case at the guilt phase, but that\n       he did not know what he was doing as to the sentencing phase.\n\nDoss, 882 So. 2d at 186.\n\n¶12.   As to the affidavit of investigator Kelvin Winbush, this Court said:\n\n              Kelvin Winbush’s affidavit states that this was his first mitigation\n       investigation, and that he was also the investigator for Frederick Bell.\n       Winbush identified Lillie Moore, Lucretia Monger, Mavis McCaster, Marvin\n       Doss, Randy Doss, and John Westmoreland, a friend, as favorable mitigation\n\n\n                                               7\n\f       witnesses. Winbush also identified Coach Smith, a teacher and coach in\n       Bruce, as someone who knew Anthony and said he “behaved fairly well for the\n       most part.” Winbush stated that he gave Bailey contact information for some\n       of the witnesses, and Bailey knew Winbush had contact information for them\n       all. Winbush says that he was never asked to follow up with the witnesses, to\n       arrange for subpoenas, to arrange for their presence at trial, or to look for\n       additional witnesses after Winbush’s initial report. He was also not asked to\n       do any investigating in Chicago.\n\nId.\n\n¶13.   Carolyn Watkins, public defender in Shelby County, “states in an affidavit that she\n\nobtained school records for Doss from Chicago; Doss’ medical records from Chicago,\n\nincluding records involving a 1986 head injury; and the 1988 psychological report done at\n\nthe University of Mississippi. She states that Lee Bailey never requested these records.” Id.\n\n¶14.   As to the remaining affidavits, this Court characterized them as follows:\n\n       The affiants say that Doss was shy and quiet, not a violent person; that there\n       were times when Doss seemed to go into a seizure or trance of some kind,\n       when he did not respond to people; that he had mental or medical problems\n       that began with his mother’s drinking and drug use during her pregnancy with\n       him, followed by lead poisoning and head injuries during Doss’ childhood;\n       that mental illness seemed to run in the Doss family; that Doss was easily led\n       by Frederick Bell, who was a bad, violent person and came from a violent\n       family; that Doss began to run with a bad crowd when he moved from Chicago\n       to Mississippi; that Doss’ birth and upbringing in Chicago were riddled with\n       crime, drug abuse and poverty. Specifically mentioned and blamed for much\n       of the misfortune suffered by Doss and his family in Chicago was Sam Brown,\n       who lived with Doss’ mother. Doss apparently believed for much of his early\n       life that Sam Brown was his biological father. According to various affidavits,\n       Sam Brown was violent and abusive toward Doss, his mother and the rest of\n       the family; he took what little money the family had to buy drugs and gamble;\n       and he sold drugs and introduced the children in the family to drugs.\n\nDoss, 882 So. 2d at 187.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f¶15.   In finding that Doss should have the opportunity to present evidence to the trial court\n\nin support of his claim that counsel’s failure to investigate and present available mitigation\n\nevidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court said:\n\n       We acknowledge that many discrepancies exist among the affidavits presented\n       by Doss in support of this issue. However, we conclude that Doss has made\n       a sufficient showing under the Strickland test that Bailey’s efforts fell short of\n       the efforts a counsel should make in a death penalty sentencing trial, so as to\n       entitle Doss to an evidentiary hearing on this claim in the circuit court. This\n       was Bailey’s first death penalty case, and he admitted that he did not know\n       what he was doing in the sentencing phase. When counsel makes choices of\n       which witnesses to use or not use, those choices must be made based on\n       counsel’s proper investigation. Counsel’s minimum duty is to interview\n       potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and\n       circumstances of the case.\n\nId. at 189.\n\n¶16.   The trial court held a PCR evidentiary hearing in 2006 and heard testimony from Lee\n\nBailey, Q.T. Doss, Sadie Doss, Sandra Price and Sam Phillips. On December 12, 2006, the\n\ntrial court issued an opinion, finding that Doss had not received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. We find the trial court’s findings to be clearly erroneous.\n\n¶17.   Doss’ application for leave to this Court included, as an exhibit, an affidavit from\n\nBailey, which stated, in relevant part:\n\n               3. Prior to this, I had never represented a defendant in a capital murder\n       case where the death penalty was sought.\n               4. I did not seek or obtain any school, medical, mental health, or other\n       records regarding Mr. Doss. This was not for any strategic reasons. I did not\n       realize the importance of obtaining such records in order to prepare for the\n       sentencing phase of a capital case.\n               5. I knew the defendant, Mr. Doss, had grown up in Chicago and had\n       gone to elementary school and into the beginning of high school there. I was\n       aware that Mr. Doss had been in special education classes in Chicago and also\n       suffered from blackouts and headaches. However, I did not understand the\n       significance of this and did not seek any advice from a mental health expert.\n\n\n                                               9\n\fAlso, I did not request funds for a mental health expert or any type of mental\nhealth evaluation. This was not for any strategic reason.\n        6. I did not obtain any records from the investigation done in Memphis\nby Mr. Doss’ attorney there. However, I did obtain the indictment and\njudgment in that case.\n...\n        9. I did not ask Mr. Winbush [investigator who provided statements\nand contact information for several potential witnesses to Bailey] to follow up\nwith any of these potential witnesses, or with anyone else, and I did not follow\nup with them myself to obtain more information or to determine for myself\nwhether they would be helpful witnesses. I did not ask any of them to testify\nat the sentencing phase. This was not for any particular strategic reason.\n        10. Other than the family members just mentioned and Mr.\nWestmoreland [possible witness who knew Doss], the only other specific\nindividuals Mr. Winbush identified that he had talked to were two teachers in\nBruce, Mississippi, Mrs. Parker and someone he identified only as “Coach\nSmith.” But it was Freddie Bell who had gone to school in Bruce, not Mr.\nDoss, who lived in Calhoun City. Indeed, Mr. Winbush told me that Mrs.\nParker had only taught Mr. Bell, not Mr. Doss. Mr. Winbush said that “Coach\nSmith” knew Mr. Doss and that Mr. Doss had behaved well around him. He\nnever explained how Coach Smith knew Mr. Doss. I did not ask Mr. Winbush\nto go back for clarification, or to go back and try to find others who might\nknow Mr. Doss as opposed to Mr. Bell, including those who lived in Calhoun\nCity where Mr. Doss presently lived. I did not do this investigation myself and\ndid not try to contact Coach Smith myself.\n        11. Although I knew Mr. Winbush was working as the investigator for\nMr. Bell, I did not consider at the time how this posed a conflict of interest.\nI was not particularly focused on obtaining evidence for the sentencing phase\nto show that Mr. Bell was the more culpable of the two, and that he had\ndominated Mr. Doss and led him into these misdeeds. Had I been focused on\nthat, I might have realized the conflict and sought another investigator.\n        12. To the extent that Mr. Winbush claimed that he spent 100-120\nhours investigating this case, I do not believe this is accurate. Even if you\ninclude the time he spent driving and looking for people, I do not think he\nspent that much time.\n        13. I did not do any mitigation investigation in Chicago, where Mr.\nDoss grew up and lived most of his life, and I did not ask Mr. Winbush to do\nso. I did not contact any witnesses or family members there. I did not seek\nfunds from the Court for such an investigation. This was not for any strategic\nreason.\n        14. My time records show that the only family members or friends who\nI interviewed were the defendant’s mother, who was the only witness I\npresented at the punishment phase, and one of the defendant’s aunts, who I did\n\n\n                                      10\n\f       not call as a witness. The discussion with them lasted only a few minutes\n       according to my records. I did talk again with the defendant’s mother during\n       the trial, and prior to her testimony, I discussed the possible testimony with\n       her. However, this discussion was not lengthy and I did not spend much time\n       interviewing her or preparing her to take the stand.\n               15. The omissions that I have mentioned in this affidavit with respect\n       to the mitigation investigation were not motivated by any particular strategic\n       reason. Although I believe I did a good job in defending this case at the guilt\n       phase, I had never handled a punishment phase in a capital case before. It is\n       unlike anything I have ever done. There’s no other proceeding that I have ever\n       been involved in where the jury decides the punishment, and of course, none\n       where the stakes were this high. My omissions in the punishment phase in this\n       case were due, I believe, to my inexperience in this particular type of\n       proceeding. Looking back on it, I believe now that I provided a good defense\n       at the guilt phase, but that I failed to undertake the essential functions of\n       properly and thoroughly investigating mitigation and presenting a defense at\n       the penalty phase.\n               16. If I failed to make any objections during the trial that should have\n       been made, that was not the result of any strategy decisions.\n\nLee Bailey Aff. (Aug. 23, 2001).\n\n¶18.   After the PCR hearing, the trial court found that the “testimony of Lee Bailey was in\n\nsharp contrast with the information that was contained in the affidavit” submitted to this\n\nCourt, but that Bailey was not trying to mislead, because he did not have access to his case\n\nfile when he signed the affidavit and was “relying on his memory of events that had taken\n\nplace over eight years earlier.” The trial court also noted that Bailey believed he had not\n\nobtained records from Carolyn Watkins, Doss’ public defender in Memphis, when he signed\n\nthe affidavit, but then realized two days before trial that he had actually gotten some of these\n\nrecords.\n\n¶19.   The trial court’s reasoning was incorrect. Bailey’s inability to remember that he had\n\nactually obtained these records could not have been because he did not have access to his\n\nfile. Bailey admitted during redirect examination that the file was available any time he\n\n\n                                              11\n\frequested it and that McDuff, Doss’ present counsel, went so far as to offer to drive the file\n\nto Bailey. Also, the following exchange occurred between McDuff and Bailey during the\n\nhearing:\n\n       Q.      Was there ever a time that you asked me to look at that file that I didn’t\n               get it to you within a few days?\n       A.      No.\n       Q.      Okay.\n       A.      Now, there was – there was something he asked awhile ago about\n       meeting halfway in Jackson. I remember something about that. But no,\n       you’ve always been cordial. You always – whenever I wanted something, you\n       had it right there.\n\n¶20.   Moreover, the portion of the file containing the records that Bailey found two days\n\nbefore trial was not even included in the file that was given to McDuff, but rather was found\n\nin a storage box in Bailey’s office. Specifically, Bailey testified during direct examination\n\nin the PCR hearing:\n\n       A.      I got some records from Memphis. I think that Caroline Watson [sic]\n       either had them sent to me by someone else or she sent them to me. I don’t\n       know, but I got them in my possession. And they weren’t in the regular file.\n       ...\n       Q.      Okay. And, and where did you find them?\n       A.      In an old file of mine, a big box that I had old criminal files stored away\n       in. I found them in there.\n       Q.      Were they in a particular file folder that was labeled?\n       A.      No.\n\n¶21.   Bailey further testified that the documents that he discovered two days before the PCR\n\nhearing included records from North Mississippi Medical Center, Shelby County government\n\n(from Joyce King, legal investigator), Bethany Hospital in Chicago, and a psychological\n\nreport from the University of Mississippi. Bailey also acknowledged that some of the reports\n\nwere missing multiple pages and he had never obtained complete copies. Moreover, with the\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fexception of the “forgotten” records, the remainder of Bailey’s testimony at the PCR hearing\n\nverified his sworn statements in the affidavit, for example:\n\n       Q.      And prior to you signing that affidavit you and I – prior to any affidavit\n       being drafted you and I talked about this case, didn’t we? I came to your\n       office and we talked.\n       A.      Sure. Sure.\n       Q.      And then I drafted an affidavit, and I brought it back to you. And you\n       and I went over it line-by-line, didn’t we?\n       A.      Sure.\n       Q.      And you told me that everything in there that you signed in the file [sic]\n       version was true, didn’t you?\n       A.      Sure.\n       Q.      You signed it under oath, didn’t you?\n       A.      Sure.\n       Q.      Now, did you lie in that affidavit?\n       A.      I didn’t remember about those files that I got from Caroline Watson\n               [sic].\n       Q.      Right. You thought you had not requested those.\n       A.      I didn’t think I had those.\n       Q.      Is there any place other than that where you said something – you\n       believed it was true at the time. Was there any place where you said\n       something you didn’t believe was true?\n       A.      No. No. Paragraph 5, about him growing up in Chicago. Yeah. That’s\n       true. Having black-outs. Yeah. I didn’t seek a medical health expert. That’s\n       true. I didn’t think that Winbush was a conflict of interest. You know, that’s\n       true. I didn’t ask him to follow up on any of these witnesses. That’s true.\n               But now, not being particularly focused on the sentencing hearing,\n       some things have been said in here today that leads me to think that yeah, I\n       was trying to get some witnesses for the sentencing. But as far as I was\n       concerned and having as little experience as I had, which was absolutely none,\n       I didn’t see that there were any witnesses other than what we had.\n       Q.      And do you recall that when you and I talked about this case, I had your\n               file with me, brought it to Grenada prior to you signing the affidavit so\n               you could go through it?\n       A.

You talking about five years ago?\n       Q.

I just know – I know that you came up and came\n       up fairly often I thought. You were really diligent, but I don’t – I just\n       remember signing the affidavit.\n              In fact, I didn’t even remember what was in it. When Doug Evans\n       [prosecutor] was asking me about it, I said I signed an affidavit. I don’t\n       remember what it was. But, you know, memory – memory is slipping a little.\n       Q.     Right. Are you able to say at this point – I want to make this clear. Are\n       you saying at this point that we did not go through the file prior to you signing\n       that?\n       A.     No, I am not saying that. You went through everything thoroughly.\n       Q.     And in Paragraphs 4 and 6 about the records, as soon as you found\n       those records you told me; right?\n       A.     Right.\n\n¶22.   The trial court further found that Doss and his mother were not “forthcoming with\n\nmany witnesses who could offer testimony that would be favorable to Anthony,” and that\n\nBailey was given the name of Derma Police Chief Mark Hendrix, but chose not to call him\n\nbecause of an unfavorable ruling on a motion in limine.2 Specifically, the trial court found\n\nthat “[t]his shows that Bailey made an effort to locate any witnesses that Anthony believed\n\ncould offer testimony that would be favorable to him.” The trial court said:\n\n               This court during the evidentiary hearing heard many tales of woe\n       concerning the environment in which Anthony was reared, including an\n       abusive father/stepfather and an indifferent and alcoholic mother. However,\n       this information was not provided to Bailey during his representation of Doss.\n       Sadie testified that she did not share the information concerning Anthony with\n       Bailey. She stated that only after getting to know McDuff and thinking of him\n       as a brother, did she share information with McDuff concerning the details of\n       her life and of Anthony’s upbringing.\n               This court does not believe that the failure of Bailey to learn the sordid\n       details of the life of Sadie Doss and of Anthony, in any way indicates that\n       Bailey was ineffective. He was relying on Sadie and Anthony to provide\n       information about Anthony’s life and of potential witnesses that could testify\n       favorably about Anthony. If those two did not provide that information to\n       Bailey, he is not to blame for their lack of forthrightness. Only from them,\n\n       2\n        Bailey admitted during redirect examination that he also could have filed a motion in limine\nto prohibit the introduction of evidence of the youth court charges, but failed to do so.\n\n                                                14\n\f       could he have learned the names of Q.T. Doss, Sam Phillips, Sandra Price, or\n       the individuals that submitted affidavits to the Mississippi Supreme Court, but\n       did not testify at the hearing.\n\nOp’n, Circuit Court of Grenada County, at pp. 9-10 (Dec. 12, 2006).\n\n¶23.   The trial court said that Sadie had failed to provide certain information to the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi during an unrelated proceeding in 1988 and during a brief\n\ndiscussion with Bailey in 1993, saying:\n\n       This court will not speculate as to whether she failed to provide this\n       information to the University of Mississippi and to Bailey due to\n       embarrassment, or whether much of her testimony in the evidentiary hearing\n       was a figment of her imagination due to too many years of drinking Crown\n       Royal and beer, or whether her testimony is laced with perjury [n4] and\n       exaggeration in an attempt to free Anthony from death row. However, this\n       court is of the opinion that Bailey did the best he could with the 1993 version\n       of the truth that was provided by Sadie.\n\n                 n4     She either perjured herself in Anthony’s original trial or\n                 at the evidentiary hearing. At the trial, she testified that Sam\n                 Brown was Anthony’s father. Now she claims his father is Sam\n                 Phillips.\n\nOp’n at p. 11.\n\n¶24.   However, the trial court’s findings are contradicted by the record in this matter. The\n\nrecord establishes that Bailey spoke only briefly to Sadie by telephone and never met with\n\nher in person prior to Doss’ trial in 1993. Further, during the sentencing phase of Doss’ trial,\n\nBailey failed to ask a single question that would evoke any “sordid details of the life of Sadie\n\nand Anthony” or that would evoke any “tales of woe” about abuse as stated by the trial court.\n\nThe relevant portions of Sadie’s testimony on direct examination by Bailey from 1993 are\n\nas follows:\n\n       Q.        Now, where was Anthony born?\n\n\n                                                15\n\fA.    Chicago.\nQ.    And, who is his father?\nA.    Sam Brown.\nQ.    Is Sam here today?\nA.    No, he’s not. He don’t know anything about it.\n...\nA.    He’s not here. He don’t know anything about it. I got – I tried to get\n      in touch with him, but I couldn’t.\nQ.    And, are you and Sam married?\nA.    No, we not; common law.\nQ.    How long did Anthony live in Chicago?\nA.    I think 16 years, if I’m not mistaken. 15 or 16 years.\nQ.    And, then where did he move to?\nA.    Calhoun City.\nQ.    And, he’s been living there with you?\nA.    Yes.\nQ.    Did he go to school there?\nA.    A period of time.\nQ.    How long?\nA.    I really don’t know. I think about a couple of months.\nQ.    What grade has Anthony completed in school?\nA.    It was ‘twixt [sic] the 9th and the 10th.\nQ.    Has he been working?\nA.    No. He went to look for a job. They say he’s too short and too young.\n...\nQ.    Do you have any other relatives that live there with you?\nA.    Talking about in Calhoun City?\nQ.    Uh-huh. (Affirmative.)\nA.    When Anthony was with me?\nQ.    Uh-huh. (Affirmative.)\nA.    Yes, I did.\nQ.    How many?\nA.    One.\nQ.    And, what kind of home did you have?\nA.    Beautiful home. One more thing. You say who all stayed. My other\n      – I have one daughter stayed with me, period.\nQ.    Now, do you work?\nA.    No, I don’t. I been sick.\nQ.    Huh?\nA.    I’m sick.\nQ.    How long you been sick?\nA.    For 20-something years.\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\f       Q.     Now, what kind of income does your family have? When Anthony was\n              living there with you?\n       A.     I was on welfare at the time.\n       ...\n       Q.     And, he didn’t graduate from high school?\n       A.     Only from the 8th.\n       Q.     Now, you know Anthony. Would you tell us how – what kind of\n              person is Anthony?\n       A.     Anthony was a warm, beautiful person, and he alway [sic] at home with\n              me, and when I was sick he always would get up and he try to fix me\n              food. Sometimes I can’t walk. The arthritis have me sometimes. Like\n              today, I may be able to walk just as straight as any of y’all and then the\n              next couple of days, I may not can walk. I have to walk with a crutch.\n              And, he would do for me. He always said, “Mama, I want to get a job,\n              where I can take care of you.” And, Anthony also was playing ball one\n              day and this – a man came through the alley and hit him on the head\n              and busted his head, and I took him to the doctor. He had a concussion.\n              So, Anthony was very good. And, after that he started having\n              headaches, and I took him to the doctor.\n       Q.     When was this that he got hit in the head?\n       A.     It was when he was about 11. And he also got hit in the head when he\n              was about 17, I think. At 17 he got hit in the head again.\n       Q.     Now, when you say hit in the head, are you talking serious?\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     All right, hospital?\n       A.     I took him to the hospital and they release him, and he also was hit\n              again and he was taken to the hospital, and they sent me a statement\n              from Chicago – from the hospital – that – I don’t have the papers now\n              – that his hand was hurt and his head was busted.\n       Q.     All right, now, when he got hit in the head these times did you notice\n              any change in Anthony?\n       A.     He would have headaches. Some days he won’t say nothing. Then, the\n              next day, he talk. But, he didn’t bother nobody.\n\n¶25.   Clearly, counsel was aware of Doss’ head injuries, yet failed to investigate the details\n\nbehind these injuries or to present any other evidence during the sentencing phase regarding\n\nthe extent of the injuries and any long term or permanent damage -- despite portions of the\n\nhospital records and various psychological evaluation reports being provided to Bailey by\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fthe public defender’s office in Shelby County.3 If counsel had inquired further into Doss’\n\ninjuries, counsel easily would have obtained the names of potential witnesses such as Sandra\n\nPrice, whom the record reveals was raped during the same home invasion when Doss was\n\nbeaten with a pipe. If counsel had reviewed the records in his possession, he also would have\n\ndiscovered other possible witnesses, including Doss’ brothers and sisters. Also, counsel\n\nappeared surprised at Sadie’s statement that she had been sick. Counsel failed to ask a single\n\nquestion about whether Doss had ever been abused, what kind of environment he had been\n\nexposed to in Chicago, how he did in school, whether he was in special education classes,\n\nor anything else that could have been mitigating. Counsel merely asked what kind of home\n\nSadie had in Mississippi, not Chicago, and what kind of person Doss was, without delving\n\ninto any other relevant evidence. The duty of reasonable investigation rests squarely on\n\ncounsel’s shoulders. There is nothing in the record to establish that counsel undertook a\n\nreasonable investigation.\n\n¶26.   During the PCR hearing, Sadie Doss testified that Sam Brown is the father of her\n\nother son, Randy Doss, and that she was living with Sam Brown at the time she became\n\npregnant with Anthony. Sadie testified that Sam Phillips is actually Doss’ biological father,\n\nbut that Doss was told his father was Sam Brown and that she felt Sam Brown was his father\n\nbecause he helped raise Doss. Sadie further testified that the family suffered violent abuse\n\nat the hands of Sam Brown, who Doss believed was his father for several years and with\n\nwhom they lived until Doss was approximately fifteen years old. Sadie testified that she\n\n\n       3\n         The dissent would find Bailey’s failure to investigate Doss’ head injuries as proper under\nan entirely separate and inapplicable theory of competency. The dissent later notes the trial court’s\nfinding that “Doss did not appear to be insane.” Doss’ sanity is not at issue.\n\n                                                 18\n\fdrank heavily during her pregnancy with Doss, that Sam Brown beat her so violently that she\n\nbegan bleeding and almost suffered a miscarriage, that Sam Brown infected her with\n\ngonorrhea while she was pregnant, and that she took the medication Valium while she was\n\npregnant. In addition, Sadie testified that Doss had lead poisoning as a child; that he had\n\nwitnessed Sam Brown beating her; that he was beaten and abused by Sam Brown; that Sam\n\nBrown had abused drugs and spent the family’s money on drugs; that the family had lived\n\nin a very poor, bad, drug-infested neighborhood where gangs were prevalent in Chicago;4 and\n\nprovided various other relevant evidence that trial counsel failed to even inquire about during\n\nthe sentencing phase of Doss’ original trial.\n\n¶27.   With regard to personal information that was not reported during the interview at the\n\nUniversity of Mississippi in 1988 stemming from an unrelated youth court matter, Sadie\n\ntestified as follows:\n\n       Q.     Okay. Now, these sorts of things, the things that – the infection you\n              got, the beatings while you were pregnant, the beatings while you were\n              with Sam Brown, are those things you would – you would tell\n              strangers?\n       A.     No.\n       Q.     Would you tell many people about those things?\n       A.     No.\n       Q.     Why not?\n       A.     It would hurt me, and people laugh. I had told someone, and they\n              laughed about it.\n       Q.     Do you – do you ever remember taking Anthony to be seen by a\n              psychologist over in Oxford?\n       A.     Yes.\n\n\n       4\n         Sandra Price, Sam Brown’s daughter who also lived with the family in Chicago, likewise\ntestified during the PCR hearing that the family had lived in a very bad neighborhood, and that\nBrown had used drugs and was very angry and abusive toward the family. Price also testified about\nthe home invasion in which she was raped and Doss was beaten, suffering a head injury, and that\nDoss was very quiet and kept to himself.\n\n                                                19\n\f       Q.     Okay. Do you remember them asking you about your pregnancy?\n       A.     No, I don’t.\n       ...\n       Q.     Miss Doss, you said you didn’t tell many people about this. Why did\n              you tell me?\n       A.     Well, y’all were just so comfort [sic]. Just like he was my own family,\n              and I would talk to y’all. Just something there about you was just like\n              family, and I don’t tell everybody.\n       Q.     Did you and I spend a lot of time together?\n       A.     Yeah.\n       Q.     Did you feel like you got to know me?\n       A.     Yes, I did. Just like if you was a brother.\n       Q.     Did I explain this might be important for Anthony’s case?\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     Did I ask you to make up anything?\n       A.     No.\n       Q.     Did I ask you to say something that wasn’t true?\n       A.     No.\n       ...\n       Q.     Did Lee Bailey ask you about any of these private – would he ask you\n              any of these questions about private details, the lawyer, Anthony’s trial\n              lawyer?\n       A.     No, he did not.\n       Q.     Okay. Did you feel like you got to know Mr. Bailey very well?\n       A.     No, I did not.\n\n¶28.   Also, testimony was offered by psychological experts during the PCR hearing as to\n\nwhy Sadie initially may not have provided this information. During direct examination of\n\ncourt-appointed expert Dr. Criss Lott, counsel for Doss asked Lott whether it was necessary\n\nto spend time with people to get them to discuss private matters. Lott answered: “That\n\nvaries. I think some people may be very open. Some people certainly may be reluctant. In\n\nthe custody evaluations I do, I rarely get information from people. They don’t want to get\n\ninvolved. No matter how many times I try to contact someone like that, I may never get any\n\ninformation.” Further, during cross examination of Lott, the State elicited as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       Q.      Yeah. But, but you are – you have to rely on this sort of stuff and the\n       validity of those things. Do you find it interesting that the problems that Miss\n       Doss decided she had after the conviction, much longer after he was convicted\n       and sentenced to death, are not the same ones she had when she was having\n       him treated in 1988 at the – or interviewed or assessed at Ole Miss or at\n       Tupelo?\n               MR. MCDUFF: I am going to object to that evidence. It makes a\n       characterization that is not supported by the evidence or in the evidence.\n               THE COURT: I’ll overrule the objection.\n       A.      Mr. White, the evaluation that was done in ‘88 by the University of\n       Mississippi was a youth court evaluation which was looking, assessing Mr.\n       Doss at that time prior to going to possibly training school. It was not what I\n       would consider to be a comprehensive evaluation and certainly not a\n       comprehensive forensic evaluation. I do those evaluations too, the youth\n       court. And my report would not be as exhaustive and I would ask the mother\n       about substance abuse history but a lot of times they may be minimizing that,\n       because it is not something that they want to own up to at that point.\n               So it’s – I see it. I see that occasionally, that people – in terms of the\n       context that if I’m trying to get an evaluation for a child as to whether or not\n       they should get mental health treatment and go to Oakley. I don’t always get\n       all the data from the parents.\n               And I’ll evaluate the parent, but they may not tell me everything at that\n       time. So it’s – I see that and I understand your concern here. But for me it\n       hasn’t been that unusual, not to get all the data in certain cases.\n\n¶29.   Dr. Timothy Summers also testified about this:\n\n       Q.     In obtaining information that a person might consider private or\n       embarrassing, is it important for the psychologist or psychiatrist, whoever is\n       interviewing them, to take their time with that person to explain?\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     Explain why this private, perhaps embarrassing, information is being\n       sought.\n       A.     Yes.\n       Q.     Dr. Lott testified earlier about the difference between the cursory\n       evaluation and more extensive forensic evaluation. Is it possible that a cursory\n       evaluation, like a youth court evaluation, a person might not reveal\n       embarrassing information but then later might do so once they are approached\n       and the importance is explained to them of talking about private details?\n       A.     Yes.\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fAgain, there is nothing in the record to indicate Bailey ever asked Sadie any questions that\n\nwould elicit this evidence. Moreover, even if neither Doss nor Sadie had provided any\n\nmitigating evidence, Bailey still would not have been relieved of his duty to investigate. See\n\nRompilla v. Beard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005) (“[E]ven when\n\na capital defendant’s family members and the defendant himself have suggested that no\n\nmitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and\n\nreview material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of\n\naggravation at the sentencing phase . . . .”) In Rompilla, the evidence in mitigation\n\nincluded the brief testimony of five of Rompilla’s family members arguing for residual\n\ndoubt, asking for mercy, and saying that Rompilla was innocent and a good man. On PCR,\n\nRompilla raised ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to present significant mitigating\n\nevidence about his childhood, mental capacity and health, and alcoholism. The trial court\n\ndenied relief, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Rompilla then petitioned for\n\na writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, which found, in relevant part, that counsel\n\nhad failed to investigate “pretty obvious signs” of Rompilla’s troubled childhood and his\n\nmental illness and alcoholism, “and instead had relied unjustifiably on Rompilla’s own\n\ndescription of an unexceptional background.” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 379. The Third Circuit\n\nCourt of Appeals reversed, finding in part that counsel had attempted to uncover mitigation\n\nevidence by interviewing Rompilla and family members and by consulting with three mental\n\nhealth experts. After granting certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed, noting\n\nthat this “case, like some others recently, looks to norms of adequate investigation in\n\npreparing for the sentencing phase of a capital trial, when defense counsel’s job is to counter\n\n                                              22\n\fthe State’s evidence of aggravated culpability with evidence in mitigation.” Id. at 380-81.\n\nApplying a standard of reasonableness, the Court addressed the minimal contributions of\n\nRompilla and his family members to any mitigation case and the lack of useful information\n\nprovided by the mental health reports. The Court also said:\n\n               When new counsel entered the case to raise Rompilla’s postconviction\n       claims, however, they identified a number of likely avenues the trial lawyers\n       could fruitfully have followed in building a mitigation case. School records\n       are one example, which trial counsel never examined in spite of the professed\n       unfamiliarity of the several family members with Rompilla’s childhood, and\n       despite counsel’s knowledge that Rompilla left school after the ninth grade. .\n       . . Other examples are records of Rompilla’s juvenile and adult incarcerations,\n       which counsel did not consult, although they were aware of their client’s\n       criminal record. And while counsel knew from police reports provided in\n       pretrial discovery that Rompilla had been drinking heavily at the time of his\n       offense, . . . , and although one of the mental health experts reported that\n       Rompilla’s troubles with alcohol merited further investigation, . . . , counsel\n       did not look for evidence of a history of dependence on alcohol that might\n       have extenuating significance.\n\nRompilla, 545 U.S. at 382 (citations omitted).\n\n¶30.   In the instant case, Bailey somehow obtained the records from the separate action in\n\nMemphis, although he was unclear on how exactly that came about, but there is no evidence\n\nhe ever actually reviewed the records, which would have opened up several possible\n\nmitigation leads. These reports included information that Doss: drank alcohol regularly and\n\nhad started drinking at age eleven; had tried other drugs; was in special education classes and\n\nhad done poorly in school; had a low IQ; had family and legal issues in Chicago; exhibited\n\ncharacteristics of various psychological disorders; and that his mental difficulties may have\n\nhad an organic basis. Bailey failed to request complete copies of the records that were\n\nmissing pages and he failed to request any records on his own. Additionally, counsel failed\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fto follow up with any of the potential witnesses interviewed by investigator Winbush. Also,\n\nBailey failed to do anything more than a brief, cursory telephone interview with Sadie Doss,\n\nwho was his sole mitigation witness.\n\n¶31.   Counsel’s performance was clearly deficient under Strickland. However, Doss must\n\nalso show that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense, i.e., but for counsel’s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id., 466 U.S.\n\nat 687. In Rompilla, the Court found:\n\n              The accumulated entries would have destroyed the benign conception\n       of Rompilla’s upbringing and mental capacity defense counsel had formed\n       from talking with Rompilla himself and some of his family members, and from\n       the reports of the mental health experts. With this information, counsel would\n       have become skeptical of the impression given by the five family members and\n       would unquestionably have gone further to build a mitigation case. Further\n       effort would presumably have unearthed much of the material postconviction\n       counsel found, including testimony from several members of Rompilla’s\n       family, whom trial counsel did not interview.\n\nRompilla, 545 U.S. at 391. The Court then summarized the evidence that would have been\n\nunearthed, including that Rompilla’s parents were both severe alcoholics, that his mother\n\ndrank during pregnancy, and that his father had a vicious temper and often beat both the\n\nmother and Rompilla. The Court also noted the evidence uncovered by Rompilla’s post-\n\nconviction counsel, specifically, that Rompilla suffered from organic brain damage, that his\n\nproblems related back to his childhood and that they were likely caused by fetal alcohol\n\nsyndrome. With regard to the prejudice prong of Strickland, the Rompilla Court said:\n\n             This evidence adds up to a mitigation case that bears no relation to the\n       few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury, and although we\n       suppose it is possible that a jury could have heard it all and still have decided\n       on the death penalty, that is not the test. It goes without saying that the\n       undiscovered “mitigating evidence, taken as a whole, ‘might well have\n\n                                              24\n\f       influenced the jury’s appraisal’ of [Rompilla’s] culpability,” Wiggins v.

Virginia\n\nin the trial courts of this state. In Atkins, the Supreme Court set forth two, almost identical,\n\ndefinitions of mental retardation.5 Atkins, 536 U.S. at 309 n.3. These definitions were\n\n\n       5\n     The first definition was provided by the American Association on Mental Retardation\n(AAMR):\n\n       “Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.\n       It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing\n       concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following\n       applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, community use, self-\n       direction, health and safety, functional academics, and work. Mental\n       retardation manifests before age 18.”\n\nAtkins, 536 U.S. at 309 n.3 (quoting Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and\nSystems of Support 5 (9th ed. 1992)).\n\nThe second definition was provided by the American Psychiatric Association:\n\n       “The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage\n       general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by\n       significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following\n       skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills,\n       use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work,\n       leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B). The onset must occur before age 18\n       years (Criterion C). Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may\n       be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that\n       affect the functioning of the central nervous system.” Diagnostic and\n       Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 39 (4th ed. 2000). “Mild” mental\n       retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 55-75 to\n       approximately 70. Id., at 42-43.\n\n\n                                              26\n\fadopted by this Court in Foster v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1780791\"><a href=\"/opinion/1780791/foster-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (Miss. 2003), and further\n\nexamined in Chase v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1844462\"><a href=\"/opinion/1844462/chase-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1029 (Miss. 2004). Both definitions of mental\n\nretardation require not only significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, but also related\n\nor significant limitations in adaptive skills that occur before age eighteen. Atkins, 536 U.S.\n\nat 309 n.3. All three factors, (1) significant subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) related\n\nor significant limitations in adaptive skills, and (3) manifestation before age 18, must be met\n\nin order for the offender to be classified as mentally retarded and eligible for Atkins\n\nprotection from execution. Id.\n\n¶34.   The case sub judice exemplifies what the Atkins majority recognized, that “[t]o the\n\nextent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders, it is\n\nin determining which offenders are in fact retarded. . . . Not all people who claim to be\n\nmentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded\n\noffenders about whom there is a national consensus.” Id. at 317. In examining the scope of\n\nAtkins, our Court has recognized that “Atkins exempts all mentally retarded persons–even\n\nthose who are minimally mentally retarded–from execution . . . .” Chase v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1844462\"><a href=\"/opinion/1844462/chase-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1013</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1026 (Miss. 2004). With recognition of the difficulty in “determining which offenders\n\nare in fact retarded[,]” the Supreme Court left to the states “the task of developing\n\nappropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction” on the execution of sentences.\n\nAtkins, 536 U.S. at 317. Unlike many states, our state Legislature has not chosen to address\n\n\n\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\fthe issue of mental retardation in the context of death-penalty litigation. Unless and until it\n\ndoes so act, we are bound to provide guidance to our trial courts and to apply the\n\nconstitutional mandates of Atkins.\n\n¶35.   Following remand by this Court, the Grenada County Circuit Court in July 2004\n\nordered that Doss be sent to the Mississippi State Hospital (“Whitfield”) for a forensic mental\n\nhealth evaluation to assist the circuit court in determining whether Doss was mentally\n\nretarded as defined in Atkins and Chase. Doss was examined at Whitfield by Drs. Gilbert\n\nMacVaugh III, Criss Lott, John Montgomery, and Reb McMichael (“Whitfield doctors”) in\n\nNovember 2005. According to Dr. Lott, the Whitfield doctors found, to a reasonable degree\n\nof psychological and psychiatric certainty, that Doss was not mentally retarded as set forth\n\nin Atkins and Chase.6 They specifically concluded that Doss had an overall IQ score of 70 7\n\nand was in the borderline range of intellectual functioning. The evaluation stated that Doss’\n\ntrue IQ score may have been higher, but possible malingering or fatigue may have factored\n\ninto the scoring.\n\n¶36.   The evaluation further stated that Doss did not have a history of significant deficits\n\nin adaptive functioning due to intellectual limitations. The evaluation noted that Doss had\n\nworked, cared for himself, and met his own basic needs, and had shown no signs of\n\nsignificant deficits as far as social/interpersonal skills, communication, use of community\n\n       6\n         A report setting forth the findings of the Whitfield doctors was admitted into\nevidence through the testimony of Dr. Lott. While the trial court received testimony from\nDrs. Lott, MacVaugh, and McMichael, the report entered into evidence provides the findings\nof all the doctors; thus, we speak in terms of the report’s contents.\n       7\n      As the dissent aptly notes, the Whitfield Report lists a full-scale IQ score of 71.\nHowever, Dr. Gilbert McVaugh testified that the correct score is 70.\n\n                                              28\n\fresources or leisure activities were concerned. The evaluation stated that Doss’ suggested\n\nproblems in areas such as functional academics, work, self-direction, health, and safety were\n\nbetter explained by his chaotic upbringing than by intellectual deficits. The evaluation found\n\nthat Doss was “fairly adept in coping with the life demands for someone his age in that\n\nenvironment.”\n\n¶37.   Finally, the evaluation stated that, despite the presence of several risk factors for\n\nmental retardation, Doss had at least two prior psychological evaluations at the age of fifteen,\n\nneither of which resulted in a diagnosis of mental retardation. These evaluations found that\n\nDoss did not demonstrate deficits consistent with mental retardation prior to reaching the age\n\nof eighteen.\n\n¶38.   Doss also was examined by Dr. Daniel Grant in May 2005. Grant found that Doss’\n\ntest results were similar to test results obtained by other psychologists, which indicated\n\nconsistent effort and a lack of malingering. Grant found that, as the complexity of a task\n\nincreased, Doss’ level of performance decreased. Grant agreed with earlier findings of Dr.\n\nGelbort that Doss’ test results and past history were consistent with “neuropsychological\n\nimpairments and probable organic brain dysfunction” and were “likely both congenital and\n\nacquired at an early age.” Grant found that Doss’ IQ score of 71, recorded when he was\n\nfifteen, would actually be in the 66-to-67 score range when corrected. Grant found that the\n\ntests he had administered clearly placed Doss’ level of functioning within the mild mental\n\nretardation range of intelligence, and also showed significant impairments in adaptive-\n\nbehavior skills. Grant found that Doss’ test results were “consistent with the diagnosis of\n\nMild Mental Retardation as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\n\n\n                                              29\n\fDisorders Fourth Edition - Text Revision, Mental Retardation Definitions, Classification, and\n\nSupports, Tenth Edition published by the American Association on Mental Retardation and\n\nas described by the United States Supreme Court in the Atkins decision.”\n\n¶39.   Doss also was examined by Dr. Timothy Summers in July 2006. Summers did not\n\nperform any testing on Doss but relied on prior tests and reports by others. Summers found\n\nthat Doss was mentally retarded “as defined in Atkins v. Virginia as manifested by an IQ of\n\n71 and limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two areas of functioning significantly\n\nlower than his peers of equal age prior to the time that he was 18.” Summers further found\n\nthat Doss “meets the mental retardation criteria(s) as defined by the American Association\n\nof Mental Retardation, which defines mental retardation as an IQ between 70-75 as well as\n\nadaptional functional limitations described above along with identification of sub average\n\nintellectual functioning prior to age 18.” Summers found that Doss “experienced significant\n\nlimitations in his effectiveness in meeting the day to day challenges in learning, personal\n\nindependence and social responsibility.” Summers found that Doss was easily influenced\n\nand had poor social judgment regarding association with negative peer groups. Summers\n\nconcluded that Doss would likely be the least smart person in any peer group and had\n\nproblems with logic, foresight, strategic thinking, and understanding consequences.\n\n¶40.   The circuit court considered the expert testimony and lay witnesses presented by the\n\nparties and found that Doss had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he was\n\nmentally retarded. The circuit court found that the Whitfield doctors, who had determined\n\nthat Doss was not retarded, were more credible than Drs. Summers and Grant, who had found\n\nthat Doss was retarded. The record revealed that Dr. Grant had not administered any tests\n\n\n                                             30\n\fto show lack of malingering, as required by Chase.8 The court also found that Dr. Summers\n\ndid not test for malingering.\n\n¶41.   The circuit court noted that all of the examiners had opined that Doss met the first\n\nrequirement of mental retardation, that he displayed subaverage intellectual functioning, and,\n\nas a result, the court analyzed only the issue of deficits in adaptive functioning. The court\n\nnoted that Drs. Grant and Summers had made the required findings in this area to determine\n\nthat Doss was retarded. It further found that Dr. Grant had relied strictly on tests he had\n\nadministered to Doss and had spoken to no family members or other persons besides Doss.\n\nThe court found that the tests used by Grant had not been normed for prison populations. Dr.\n\nSummers made his finding based on his interview with Doss, affidavits from family\n\nmembers, and prior testing.\n\n¶42.   The circuit court noted that Drs. MacVaugh and Lott had interviewed Doss, numerous\n\nfamily members, and others who had observed him in the past. Doss was given two tests by\n\nthe examiners at the Mississippi State Hospital to assess malingering, one of which indicted\n\npossible malingering. The court noted that Drs. MacVaugh and Lott had determined that\n\nDoss did not have deficits in adaptive functioning, and that Doss had held legal jobs and had\n\nobtained money illegally, saved and spent his money, bought his clothes and prepared his\n\nfood, played sports, and engaged in personal relationships. The court found the Whitfield\n\ndoctors’ “approach and the methodology that they used is much more compelling than the\n\napproach used by experts offered by Doss.” The circuit court adopted the findings of Drs.\n\n\n\n       8\n         The court noted that Dr. Grant had assessed malingering in terms of consistency in\ntest-taking behavior, but that he had not administered a specific test to assess malingering.\n\n                                             31\n\fMacVaugh, Lott, and McMichael, and found that Doss had failed to prove, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that he was mentally retarded.\n\n¶43.   Doss argues that the circuit court erroneously rejected Dr. Grant’s finding of mental\n\nretardation because Dr. Grant failed to test for malingering as required by Chase. According\n\nto Dr. Grant, he determined that Doss was not malingering by the consistency of scores of\n\ntests taken in the past. While the circuit court certainly noted this action or inaction by Dr.\n\nGrant, this was not the only factor in its decision to reject Dr. Grant’s findings. Further, it\n\nwas an appropriate consideration for the court when reviewing the totality of the evidence\n\npresented.\n\n¶44.   Doss next argues that the circuit court erred in accepting the opinions of Drs.\n\nMacVaugh and Lott over that of Dr. Grant on the issue of adaptive functioning, even though\n\nDr. Grant was the only one to administer adaptive-functioning tests. Doss also argues that\n\nthe tenth edition of Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, Assistance, and Support,\n\nby the AAMR, specifically requires adaptive-functioning testing in order to determine mental\n\nretardation, and Dr. Grant’s opinion, which was based on the tenth edition of Mental\n\nRetardation and included such testing, was the only credible opinion given at Doss’ hearing.\n\nAs we will explain infra, these arguments are flawed for two reasons: (1) this Court has\n\nrecently held in Lynch v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1691748\"><a href=\"/opinion/1691748/lynch-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miss. 2007), that there is not one test to\n\ndetermine mental retardation, including the adaptive functioning component; and (2) there\n\nis no agreement among scholars or professionals as to the proper testing to be used in\n\nassessing adaptive functioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\f¶45.   This Court clarified the nature of testing for and defining mental retardation in Lynch\n\nv. State:\n\n       Accordingly, in Mississippi it is acceptable to utilize the MMPI-II and/or other\n       similar tests. Id. at 1029. This Court did not intend by its holding to declare\n       the MMPI-II or any one test as exclusively sufficient. Having a variety of tests\n       at their disposal, courts are provided with a safeguard from possible\n       manipulation of results and diminished accuracy which might result if courts\n       are limited to one test. The United States Supreme Court mentioned the\n       Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales Test. See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 309 n.5, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span>\n       <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Other tests, as suggested by mental health experts, include the\n       Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS), the Validity Indicator\n       Profile (VIP), and the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM). See Douglass\n       Mossman, [Atkins v. Virginia]: A Psychiatric Can of Worms, 33 N.M.L. Rev.\n       255, 277-78 (Spring 2003).\n\n       The Court's interpretation in this case as to the proper test to be administered\n       with regard to an Atkins hearing supercedes any contrary decisions. This Court\n       neither endorses the MMPI-II as the best test nor declares that it is a required\n       test, and decisions that state otherwise are expressly overruled.

Our trial courts are free to use any of the above listed and\n       approved tests or other approved tests not listed to determine mental\n       retardation and/or malingering by a defendant.\n\nLynch, 951 So. 2d at 556-57 (emphasis added). The trial court did not have the benefit of\n\nLynch, as it was decided after the circuit court issued its opinion on Doss’ mental retardation.\n\nThe Whitfield doctors followed Chase as this Court directed in Doss v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1701984\"><a href=\"/opinion/1701984/doss-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190-91, 192 n.1 (Miss. 2004), and based their opinion on the ninth edition of Mental\n\nRetardation. Under Lynch, the experts who examined Doss and the circuit court were free\n\nto use or consider any approved test “to determine mental retardation and/or malingering by\n\na defendant.” Lynch, 951 So. 2d at 557.\n\n                                              33\n\f¶46.   Furthermore, the conceptualization of “adaptive behavior” or “adaptive skills” has\n\nproven elusive. Note, Implementing Atkins, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 2565, 2573 (2003); Lois A.\n\nWeithorn, Symposium: Conceptual Hurdles to the Application of Atkins v.

Rev. 1211, 1234 n.3 (2007)\n\n(noting that scholars and courts alike find that determinations regarding adaptive functioning\n\nare often subjective). There has been confusion not only about the concept itself, but also\n\ndisagreement as to its value. Note, Implementing Atkins, 116 Harv. L. Rev. at 2575. Some\n\nstudies have suggested that IQ remains the best way of measuring intelligence in some\n\ncontexts. Id.; see also James W. Ellis and Ruth A. Luckasson, Symposium on the ABA\n\nCriminal Justice Mental Health Standards: Mentally Retarded Criminal Defendants, 53 Geo.\n\nWash. L. Rev. 414, 422 n.46 (citing Zigler, Balla & Hodapp, On the Definition and\n\nClassification of Mental Retardation, 89 Am. J. Mental Deficiency 215, 227 (1984)) (noting\n\nthat three scholars have proposed that adaptive functioning be omitted from the definition\n\nof mental retardation because “‘the essence of mental retardation involves inefficient\n\ncognitive functioning’”).\n\n¶47.   Adaptive functioning historically has been assessed “on the inherently subjective\n\nbases of interviews, observations, and professional judgment.” Klein, 72 Brooklyn L. Rev.\n\nat 1235. In recent decades, researchers have developed an increasing number of test\n\ninstruments for quantifying adaptive functioning, only a few of which have gained\n\nacceptance in the field. Id.; Weithorn, 59 Hastings L.J. at 1220. These tests provide a\n\n\n                                             34\n\fnecessary objective measurement but offer no panacea. There are “no generally accepted\n\npsychometric instruments for measuring adaptive skill levels that are commensurate in\n\nreliability with IQ tests.” Note, Implementing Atkins, 116 Harv. L. Rev. at 2575 n.72 (citing\n\nAAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports, 24, 87-90\n\n(10th ed. 2002)) (noting that the AAMR concedes that there is no consensus regarding tests\n\nfor adaptive behavior, but states there are a number of tests with “excellent psychometric\n\nproperties”).   One commentator suggests that existing measurement instruments are\n\ninadequate and have very little utility in the Atkins context. Weithorn, 59 Hastings L.J. at\n\n1222.\n\n¶48.    By citing these controversies, we in no way suggest that this Court abandon the\n\nadaptive-behavior prong, or intimate that the tests for measuring adaptive functioning are\n\ninherently unreliable.     Our point is to illustrate that there is considerable, sincere\n\ndisagreement among professionals and scholars in the field as to the best method for\n\nmeasuring adaptive functioning. The concept and measurement of adaptive functioning is\n\nan unsettled area without consensus among experts and therefore, we cannot find that the\n\nWhitfield doctors’ opinions are baseless, or that the trial judge clearly erred in accepting their\n\nopinions.\n\n¶49.    We also find evidence which reasonably supports the trial judge’s conclusion that the\n\nopinions of the Whitfield doctors were more compelling. Although Dr. Grant tested Doss\n\nfor impairments in adaptive-skill behaviors, he spoke to no family members or other persons\n\nbesides Doss. Interviews with family members, and others familiar with an individual’s\n\ntypical behavior over an extended period of time in various settings, can supplement or aid\n\n\n                                               35\n\fin the interpretation of test results. Peggy M. Tobolowsky, Atkins Aftermath: Identifying\n\nMentally Retarded Offenders and Excluding Them From Execution, 30 J. Legis. 77, 98\n\n(2003) (using different sources of data is recommended rather than placing sole reliance on\n\nthe adaptive-skill assessment instrument); Linda Knauss & Joshua Kutinsky, Into the Briar\n\nPatch: Ethical Dilemmas Facing Psychologists Following Atkins v. Virginia, 11 Widener\n\nL. Rev. 121, 130-31 (2004). Additionally, testing instruments for assessing adaptive-\n\nfunctioning impairments can, for a variety of reasons, “be less than ideal for assessing adult\n\ncriminal defendants who might be mentally retarded.” Klein, 72 Brooklyn L. Rev. at 1235\n\n(citing certain problems such as the unavailability of caregivers or other reliable independent\n\nsources, the use of inappropriate norms, and the atypical environment of a prison); Knauss\n\n& Kutinsky, 11 Widener L. Rev. at 131 (“Few (if any) measures of adaptive functioning have\n\nbeen designed or normed for use with a correctional population. Thus, adaptive functioning\n\nprior to incarceration should be the target for assessment.”); Note, Implementing Atkins, 116\n\nHarv. L. Rev. at 2576 (noting that an individual’s environment may add a layer of\n\nuncertainty to diagnosing adaptive-skill deficits). Indeed, Dr. Lott stated that he knew of no\n\nstudies that have normed an adaptive-functioning test for those on death row, and Dr. Grant\n\nadmitted that the adaptive-functioning tests he administered were not normed for a prison\n\npopulation.\n\n¶50.   In sum, we have in this case experts who take opposite positions as to whether Doss\n\nis mentally retarded. Neither side’s methodology, approach, or understanding of the issue\n\nis infallible. The ultimate issue of whether Doss is, in fact, mentally retarded for purposes\n\nof the Eighth Amendment, is one for the trial judge, who sits as the trier of fact and assesses\n\n\n                                              36\n\fthe totality of the evidence as well as the credibility of witnesses. While expert opinions are\n\nhelpful and insightful, the ultimate decision of mental retardation is not committed to the\n\nexperts, but to the trier of fact. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, “the science\n\nof psychiatry, which informs but does not control ultimate legal determinations, is an ever-\n\nadvancing science, whose distinctions do not seek precisely to mirror those of the law.”\n\nKansas v.

The trial judge heard all the evidence and the expert opinions offered, and found the\n\nWhifield doctors to be more credible. The trial judge followed the procedures we set forth\n\nin Chase and concluded that Doss had failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that\n\nhe is mentally retarded. For the reasons set forth herein, this Court cannot say that the trial\n\njudge clearly erred in doing so. Accordingly, this Court affirms the circuit court’s judgment\n\nto the extent that it denied post-conviction relief based on Doss’ Atkins claim.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶52.   Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the Circuit Court of\n\nGrenada County is affirmed to the extent that it denied post-conviction relief based on Doss’\n\nAtkins claim. The circuit court’s judgment is reversed to the extent that it denied post-\n\nconviction relief based on Doss’ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty\n\nphase, and this case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate Doss’ death\n\nsentence and to grant Doss a new penalty phase sentencing hearing, consistent with this\n\nCourt’s opinion.\n\n¶53.   PART ONE: REVERSED AND REMANDED. PART TWO: AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f      PART ONE: WALLER, C.J., DICKINSON, KITCHENS, AND CHANDLER,\nJJ., CONCUR.

I fully join Presiding Justice Graves’s excellent analysis of the first issue, and I agree\n\nthat this matter should be remanded for a new sentencing hearing. I write separately because\n\nof my concern that, in recent years, the acceptable standard for effective assistance of counsel\n\nin death-penalty cases has slipped to an unacceptably low level. See e.g. Byrom v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1938175\"><a href=\"/opinion/1938175/byrom-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 731-32 (Miss. 2006) (Dickinson, J., dissenting).\n\n¶55.   Although I have no personal reluctance in voting to affirm the death penalty in an\n\nappropriate case, I cannot do so where the defendant has not had reasonable (not necessarily\n\nperfect) representation and a fair trial; and particularly during the phase of the trial in which\n\nthe fact-finder decides whether or not to put the defendant to death.\n\n¶56.   Doss – who very well may deserve the death penalty – certainly did not have effective\n\nor reasonable representation during the penalty phase of his trial. I find it amazing that\n\nanyone might conclude otherwise, after reading the affidavit9 submitted by his trial counsel.\n\nI agree that we must remand for a new sentencing hearing on the question of whether Doss\n\nshould be executed or serve life without parole.\n\n\n       9\n           The content of the affidavit is set forth in detail in Presiding Justice Graves’s opinion.\n\n                                                  38\n\f       CHANDLER, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n       CHANDLER, JUSTICE, SPECIALLY CONCURRING:\n\n¶57.   I concur with the majority opinion authored by Justice Graves, holding that Doss\n\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel. I agree with the majority that Anthony Doss’s trial\n\ncounsel, Lee Bailey, rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance at the penalty phase of\n\nDoss’s trial because he failed to investigate all available evidence in mitigation. I write\n\nseparately to additionally express that, in my opinion, counsel’s performance was deficient\n\nbecause he did not obtain records from the Chicago Public School system that would have\n\nbeen generated when Doss was determined to be learning-disabled and placed into special\n\neducation classes. Had counsel obtained these records, he would have had access to\n\nfederally-mandated information from teachers, school officials, and Doss’s mother and\n\nstepfather quite possibly, regarding Doss’s behavior, homelife, intellectual capacity, and\n\nacademic functioning.\n\n¶58.   As established at the evidentiary hearing, Bailey obtained documents from Doss’s\n\npublic defender in Memphis. These documents included a copy of the public defender’s\n\nrequest for records from Faraday Elementary School in Chicago, which was attached to a\n\none-page copy of Doss’s registration card from the Chicago Public School system. This\n\nregistration card showed that Doss had been enrolled in the Chicago Public School system\n\nthrough the ninth grade. Bailey’s records from Memphis also included transcripts from\n\nMarshall High School, which showed that Doss had attended part of the ninth grade there,\n\nand that his last day was March 29, 1988. This was consistent with the evidence that Doss\n\nmoved from Chicago to Calhoun City, Mississippi, in March 1988.\n\n                                              39\n\f¶59.   The registration card shows that the last academic year that Doss attended Faraday\n\nElementary School was the 1986-1987 school year, when Doss was in the eighth grade. Doss\n\nturned fourteen in November of that school year. A handwritten note at the bottom of the\n\npage containing the copy of the registration card stated: “Anthony Doss received Learning\n\nDisabilities Resource Services while at Faraday. All of his school records were sent to\n\nMarshall High School including those Special Education Records. s/ [illegible], Counselor.”\n\n¶60.   According to the 1986 version of regulations promulgated by the United States\n\nDepartment of Education, beginning on October 1, 1977, before special education services\n\nwere provided to a child, a public agency was required to “have in effect an individualized\n\neducation program for every handicapped child who is receiving special education from that\n\nagency.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.342 (1986), see also Education for All Handicapped Children Act\n\nof 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-142, 89 Stat. 773 (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1461\n\n(1982)).   An “‘individualized education program’ means a written statement for a\n\nhandicapped child that is developed and implemented in accordance with §§300.341-\n\n300.349.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.340 (1986). The public agency was to make efforts to include\n\nthe child’s parents at meetings for the purpose of developing an individualized education\n\nprogram, along with teachers and other individuals. 34 C.F.R. § 300.344 (1986).\n\n¶61.   An evaluation of a handicapped child was to be conducted by “a multidisciplinary\n\nteam or group of persons, including at least one teacher or other specialist with knowledge\n\nin the area of suspected disability.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.532(e) (1986). The team was to assess\n\nthe child “in all areas related to the suspected disability, including, where appropriate, health,\n\nvision, hearing, social and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance,\n\n\n                                               40\n\fcommunicative status, and motor abilities,” and it was permitted to use tests for assessment\n\npurposes. 34 C.F.R. § 300.532(a),(f) (1986).\n\n¶62.   According to the counselor’s note, Doss received learning-disabilities services at\n\nFaraday. For a school-aged child suspected of having a specific learning disability, the\n\nevaluation team was to include the child’s regular teacher, or a regular classroom teacher\n\nqualified to teach a child of his or her age, and “at least one person qualified to conduct\n\nindividual diagnostic examinations of children, such as a school psychologist, speech-\n\nlanguage pathologist, or remedial reading teacher.”      34 C.F.R. § 300.540 (1986). A\n\ndetermination that a child had a specific learning disability was governed by 34 C.F.R. §\n\n300.541, which stated:\n\n       (a) A team may determine that a child has a specific learning disability if:\n\n              (a)(1) The child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and\n              ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in paragraph (a)(2) of\n              this section, when provided with learning experiences appropriate for\n              the child’s age and ability levels; and\n\n              (a)(2) The team finds that a child has a severe discrepancy between\n              achievement and intellectual ability in one or more of the following\n              areas:\n\n                     (a)(2)(i) Oral expression;\n\n                     (a)(2)(ii) Listening comprehension;\n\n                     (a)(2)(iii) Written expression;\n\n                     (a)(2)(iv) Basic reading skill;\n\n                     (a)(2)(v) Reading comprehension;\n\n                     (a)(2)(vi) Mathematics calculation; or\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\f                     (a)(2)(vii) Mathematics reasoning.\n\n       (b) The team may not identify a child as having a specific learning disability\n       if the severe discrepancy between ability and achievement is primarily the\n       result of:\n\n              (b)(1) A visual, hearing, or motor handicap;\n\n              (b)(2) Mental retardation;\n\n              (b)(3) Emotional disturbance; or\n\n              (b)(4) Environmental, cultural or economic disadvantage.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.541 (1986). Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 300.543, an evaluation team was\n\nrequired to make a written report of the evaluation’s results, to include a statement of:\n\n              (b)(1) Whether the child has a specific learning disability;\n\n              (b)(2) The basis for making the determination;\n\n              (b)(3) The relevant behavior noted during the observation of the child;\n\n              (b)(4) The relationship of that behavior to the child’s academic\n              functioning;\n\n              (b)(5) The educationally relevant medical findings, if any;\n\n              (b)(6) Whether there is a severe discrepancy between achievement and\n              ability which is not correctable without special education and related\n              services; and\n\n              (b)(7) The determination of the team concerning the effects of\n              environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.543 (1986). All information used in making the determination had to be\n\ndocumented. 34 C.F.R. § 300.533(a)(2) (1986). Moreover, a reevaluation of a child was to\n\nbe conducted every three years, or more frequently if warranted or requested by the child’s\n\nparent or teacher. 34 C.F.R. § 300.534(b) (1986).\n\n\n                                             42\n\f¶63.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), recognized that the school records of a defendant who,\n\nlike Doss, dropped out in the ninth grade, were one avenue counsel fruitfully could have\n\nfollowed to obtain mitigating evidence to meet the State’s case of aggravation. The Memphis\n\npublic defender’s file placed Bailey on notice that Doss had been designated as learning-\n\ndisabled while attending the Faraday school. As the applicable regulations make clear, had\n\nBailey obtained the associated documentation, he would have had access to a wealth of\n\ninformation about Doss’s childhood in Chicago which he could have used either as\n\nmitigating evidence, or as a lead for locating other mitigating evidence. The evidence\n\nunearthed by Doss’s post-conviction counsel about Doss’s impoverished living conditions\n\nin Chicago, his family’s abuse at the hands of Sam Brown, his mother’s alcohol abuse, his\n\nown early drug abuse, his low I.Q., and his psychological disorders hints at the helpful\n\ninformation this documentation was likely to have contained.10 In my opinion, Bailey’s\n\nfailure to obtain this documentation, despite his notice of its existence, constituted deficient\n\nperformance that combined with the other omissions cited by the majority to prejudice Doss.\n\n¶64.   Moreover, I am quite confident that Doss was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient\n\ninvestigation. As the majority recognizes, the missing mitigating evidence was very similar\n\nto that in Rompilla, such that, taking the evidence as a whole, it “might well have influenced\n\nthe jury’s appraisal of [Doss]’s culpability.” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393. However, my\n\n\n\n       10\n         I note the fact that Doss was determined to be learning-disabled indicates that his\nevaluators did not consider him to be mentally retarded. See 34 C.F.R. § 300.541(b)(2)\n(1986).\n\n\n                                              43\n\fconclusion that Doss was prejudiced is bolstered by the fact that Doss’s jury actually\n\nindicated its ambivalence during penalty-phase deliberations by sending a note to the judge\n\nstating: “To Judge: Do we have the option of ‘Life without parole’?” The note plainly shows\n\nthat the imposition of the death penalty was not a clear-cut decision for the jury. There is a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s failure to investigate the available mitigating\n\nevidence, the penalty phase would not have resulted in a sentence of death.\n\n       WALLER, C.J., AND DICKINSON, J., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n\n       LAMAR, JUSTICE, DISSENTING TO PART ONE:\n\n¶65.   I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that Doss received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel under the test set forth in Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n¶66.    In applying the test set forth in Strickland, “a court should keep in mind that the\n\nprinciples . . . do not establish mechanical rules . . . [and] the ultimate focus of inquiry must\n\nbe on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.” Id. at\n\n696. Under the first prong, “the defendant must show that counsel’s representations fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. at 688. In assessing reasonableness,\n\n“every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the\n\ncircumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s\n\nperspective at the time.” Id. at 689. Further, there is a strong presumption that counsel’s\n\nconduct was the result of sound trial strategy, and the reasonableness of an investigative\n\ndecision “is substantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or actions.” Id. at\n\n689, 691.\n\n                                               44\n\f¶67.   Under the prejudice prong, a “defendant must show that there is reasonable probability\n\nthat, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.”   Id. at 694.   To assess prejudice, the court must reweigh the evidence in\n\naggravation against the evidence in mitigation and determine whether “the balance of\n\naggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” Id. at 695; see Wiggins\n\nv. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003). Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt had to determine whether there was a reasonable probability that the jury would not\n\nhave imposed a sentence of death had it also heard the testimony and reviewed the evidence\n\npresented in 2006.\n\n¶68.   Under the proper standard of review, this Court cannot disturb the trial court’s factual\n\nfindings unless they are clearly erroneous. Loden v.

This Court must give deference to the trial judge’s findings of fact, since he or she\n\nis the “‘sole authority for determining credibility of the witnesses.’” Id. (quoting Mullins v.\n\nRatliff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1898254\"><a href=\"/opinion/1898254/mullins-v-ratcliff/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1189 (1963)). I find that this Court has improperly reweighed the\n\nevidence presented at the PCR hearing, and further, that it has improperly reviewed evidence\n\nthat was not admitted before the trial court.\n\n¶69.   First, the majority provides a lengthy and unnecessary analysis of the affidavits\n\nattached to Doss’ motion for post-conviction relief.11 The affidavits of Lee Bailey and\n\nKelvin Winbush were never admitted into evidence before the trial court, and it is improper\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          As noted by the majority, I summarized some of the affidavits in my original\nopinion, Doss v. State, which is being withdrawn. Unlike the majority, I did not characterize\nthese affidavits as evidence, which they are not.\n\n                                                45\n\ffor this Court to consider them as evidence on appeal.12 Second, the Court fails to consider\n\nany of the aggravators presented at the first sentencing hearing, and as a consequence, its\n\nconclusion of prejudice lacks foundation from the record.\n\n¶70.   In 1993, the jury heard testimony from Frank Coffey, Sadie Doss, and E.J. Bobo.13\n\nCoffey testified that Doss had traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, after the murder of Bell, and\n\nthat Doss had committed a second murder in Memphis. Coffey confirmed that Doss had\n\nbeen convicted of second-degree murder. E.J. Bobo, an officer with the Calhoun Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment, testified that Doss had a bad reputation for peace and violence.\n\n¶71.   Sadie Doss testified that Doss had finished the ninth or tenth grade. She testified that\n\nthey had a “beautiful home,” and that Anthony was a “warm, beautiful person” who would\n\nprepare her food and help her when she was sick. However, Sadie also testified that she had\n\nrelied on welfare when Doss lived with her. She stated that Doss had suffered two serious\n\nhead injuries, one when he was eleven and one when he was seventeen. As to the effects of\n\nthe head injuries, she testified that “[Doss] would have headaches. Some days he won’t say\n\nnothing. Then, the next day, he talk.” On cross-examination, Sadie admitted that Anthony\n\nhad been convicted of second-degree murder in Tennessee.\n\n¶72.   At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the trial court presented the jury with the\n\nfollowing instructions as to aggravating and mitigating factors:\n\n\n       12\n          The trial court noted that Bailey’s 2006 testimony conflicted with his affidavit. At\nthe time Bailey signed his affidavit, he was unable to locate certain records or review Doss’\nfile, which he had given to Doss’ post-conviction- relief counsel.\n       13\n         All evidence that was admitted at the guilt phase was also reintroduced at the\nsentencing phase. See Doss v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miss. 1996), for discussion of the\nunderlying facts of this case.\n\n                                             46\n\f       Consider only the following elements of aggravation in determining whether\n       the death penalty should be imposed:\n\n       1. The defendant, Anthony Doss, was previously convicted of another capital\n       offense or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\n       2. The capital murder of Robert C. “Bert” Bell was committed while the\n       defendant was engaged or was an accomplice, in the commission of armed\n       robbery.\n       3. The capital murder of Robert C. “Bert” Bell was committed for the purpose\n       of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest.\n       ...\n\n       Consider the following elements of mitigation in determining whether the\n       death penalty would [sic] not be imposed:\n\n       (1) The age of Defendant at the time of the crime.\n       (2) Loving and caring child to his mother.\n       (3) Grew up in poverty environment.\n       (4) Lack of significant father figure.\n       (5) Suffered head injuries which changed personality.\n       (6) The Defendant acted under extreme duress or under substantial domination\n       of another person.\n       (7) The Defendant was an accomplice in the capital offense committed by\n       another person and his participation was relatively minor.\n       (8) Went into store with gun that wouldn’t fire.\n       (9) Lack of education.\n       (10) Intervened in [sic] behalf of Robert James.\n\nAfter weighing the aggravators and mitigators, the jury sentenced Doss to death.14\n\n¶73.   As the majority notes, the trial court conducted a PCR evidentiary hearing in 2006 and\n\nheard testimony from Lee Bailey, Q.T. Doss, Sadie Doss, Sandra Price, and Sam Phillips.\n\nContrary to the majority’s conclusion, I find that Bailey did perform a reasonable\n\ninvestigation for mitigation evidence. First, Bailey was in contact with the Capital Defense\n\nResource Group, which provided him with information regarding the defense of a death-\n\npenalty case. Bailey testified that he had utilized the materials provided to him.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n            The jury unanimously found that all aggravators existed beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                                               47\n\f¶74.   Bailey also testified that he had obtained school, mental health, and medical records\n\nfrom Carolyn Watkins, Doss’ public defender in Memphis, Tennessee.15 Bailey’s testimony\n\nreveals that the decision not to introduce these documents was strategic.16 The following\n\nexchange took place between Bailey and the State as to why he did not use these documents\n\nat the sentencing phase:\n\n       Q. There was a reason you didn’t want me [the prosecutor in the original trial]\n       to even know about that stuff at the time, wasn’t it?\n       A. Well, I mean it, it has some information about other acts by Anthony.\n       Q. Robberies.\n       A. Yeah.\n       Q. As a matter of fact, he was being evaluated, according to him, because he\n       had committed robberies. And he had been sent to the youth court there for\n       robberies and drug treatment; is that right?\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. Also in the stuff that I never got at that time that is in the stuff that you did\n       seek and get it showed that he was tested and his test scores showed his IQ at\n       80; is that correct?\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. You didn’t want me to have that either, did you?\n       A. No.\n       ....\n\n       15\n            The record shows that Bailey contacted Watkins on three, separate occasions.\n       16\n          The undated Discharge Summary mentioned that Doss’ “legal problems stem from\nrobberies,” that he drank alcohol regularly, had tried other drugs, and that he had an\nestimated IQ of 80.\n       The 1988 Psychological Report stated that Doss had been placed on probation with\nthe Calhoun County Youth Court as a result of guilty pleas to breaking and entering,\npossession of marijuana, and causing a family disturbance. The report also stated that Doss\nhad robbed an elderly man in Chicago. It mentioned that Doss had primarily attended\nspecial education classes in Chicago, but had been mainstreamed into some regular classes\nin junior high school, where he had achieved some success. It stated that Doss wanted to go\nback to Chicago, and that he had a 71 IQ after testing. It further provided that Doss’ mental\ndifficulties might have an organic basis. The report made no mention of Sadie’s drinking\nproblems and the terrible existence she described in living with Sam Brown in Chicago.\n\n\n\n                                               48\n\f       Q. Okay. Now, and we’ve talked about this. It was furnished in discovery.\n       If all of this stuff that you had available to you had been presented, we would\n       have possibly been able to, in addition to what the jury heard, been able to\n       bring out that he had been charged with robberies. He had been charged with\n       selling drugs. He had been charged two days before this murder with shooting\n       someone else in Bruce. All of that stuff would have possibly been able to have\n       been brought out for the jury is that correct?\n\n       [objection to speculation; court allows questioning to continue]\n\n       Q. You know about all these other charges, don’t you, from the reports?\n       ...\n\n       A. It was available.\n       Q. You had your file at that time.\n       A. Yeah.\n\n¶75.   The majority also takes issue with the fact that Bailey failed to investigate the extent\n\nof Doss’ head injuries.     However, Bailey testified that further investigation was not\n\nwarranted, since Doss could clearly communicate with him and was competent to stand trial.\n\nBailey stated:\n\n       In talking with Anthony – I mean I spent some time talking with him. And I\n       didn’t – I didn’t see where Anthony had a problem discussing this case with\n       me. He told me everything about it. He explained how he grew up. I\n       remember taking down notes about his early life . . . . I remember talking to\n       him about different aspects of the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\f¶76.   Bailey also relied in part on Doss and Sadie 17 to provide names of potential witnesses\n\nto testify at the sentencing hearing. Bailey testified that he had “no reason to believe that\n\nthere was anyone in Chicago that could help Anthony Doss.” Doss and Sadie provided only\n\nthe name of one witness, Mark Hendricks, the Chief of Police in Derma, Mississippi. Doss\n\nworked for Hendricks as a confidential informant on drug cases. Bailey wanted to introduce\n\nthis testimony, but if Hendricks had testified, the State was prepared to cross-examine\n\nHendricks on several criminal violations involving Doss. While Bailey filed a motion in\n\nlimine to exclude this testimony, the trial court denied it.\n\n¶77.   Bailey also obtained court funds to hire an investigator, Kelvin Winbush. Winbush\n\nlocated and interviewed seven potential witnesses: Lillie Moore, Doss’ aunt; Coach Smith,\n\nDoss’ former physical education teacher; Marvin Joe Doss, Doss’ brother; Randy Doss,\n\nDoss’ brother; Lucretian Monger, Doss’ sister; and Mavis McCaster, Doss’ sister. Bailey\n\ndecided not to use them as witnesses, since their testimony would not have been mitigating.\n\n¶78.   The majority also argues that a proper investigation would have yielded the testimony\n\nof Q.T. Doss, Sandra Price, and Sam Phillips, in addition to the expanded testimony of Sadie\n\nDoss. Q.T. Doss, Doss’ cousin, testified that they had spent time together and had done yard\n\n\n\n       17\n           The majority incorrectly states that Bailey spoke only once with Sadie via\ntelephone. Bailey testified: “I had several – I had telephone calls. I say several. I don’t\nthink there was but maybe one or two on my timesheet, but I know I talked to her more times\nthan that by telephone.”\n       The majority also concludes that Bailey failed to elicit personal information from\nSadie at the first sentencing hearing. His failure to question Sadie as to the information that\nshe testified to in 2006 was a direct consequence of her failure to provide that information\nto him. In reviewing the mitigating instruction submitted at the first sentencing hearing, as\nwell as Sadie’s testimony, it is evident that Bailey did in fact try to solicit personal\ninformation that is crucial at the sentencing phase.\n\n                                              50\n\fwork together when Doss visited Mississippi, and later when Doss moved back from Chicago\n\nas a teenager. Q.T. stated that Doss was a quiet person and a follower, not a leader. Q.T.\n\ntestified that Doss eventually had begun to hang around with Frederick Bell, and Q.T. felt\n\nthat Bell was a bully and troublemaker. Q.T. testified that Doss knew how to defend himself,\n\nbut Q.T. was unaware of Doss having a gun.\n\n¶79.     At the 2006 hearing, Sadie testified that she had drank alcohol regularly when she was\n\npregnant with Doss, that she had contracted gonorrhea at around that time, and Sam Brown\n\nhad beaten her to the point that she had almost miscarried. She testified that other members\n\nof her family had suffered from mental problems. Sadie stated that she did not tell strangers\n\nabout these problems, and that Bailey did not ask anything about the private details of her\n\nlife.\n\n¶80.     Sandra Price testified that Sam Brown was her father and that she had lived with\n\nBrown, Sadie, and Doss in Chicago. Price confirmed at the 2006 hearing the brutal treatment\n\nthe family had received from Sam Brown, who was also a drug user. She stated that Doss\n\nwas a quiet person who generally stayed to himself. Price also testified that the family had\n\nlived in a neighborhood where gang activity and violence were common. Sandra denied that\n\nshe had seen Sadie abuse alcohol or drugs. She testified that in 1989, she had been raped and\n\nbeaten by a gang of men who broke into their residence, and that Doss also had been beaten\n\nby these intruders. The State suggested that the attack was in retaliation for Doss’ selling\n\ndrugs.\n\n¶81.     Sam Phillips testified at the 2006 hearing that he was the biological father of Anthony\n\nDoss and that he and Sadie had never married. Phillips also testified that he had raised two\n\n\n                                               51\n\fchildren who had never been in trouble with the law. Phillips further testified that he had\n\nrepeatedly told Doss to stop selling drugs and leave the streets.\n\n¶82.   The trial court concluded that Bailey had provided effective assistance of counsel to\n\nDoss. The court summarized Bailey’s testimony and concluded that Bailey was not to blame\n\nfor Doss and Sadie’s “lack of forthrightness.” The circuit court also found that Lee Bailey\n\nhad no trouble communicating with Doss, and Doss did not appear to be insane. The court\n\nalso noted that at the time of Doss’ trial, execution of the mentally retarded was not\n\nprohibited. The circuit court found that nothing in the records indicated that Doss was\n\nmentally retarded, or that Bailey should have consulted a mental-health expert.\n\n¶83.   The trial court was presented with conflicting testimony from Sadie. Her testimony\n\non alcohol abuse and mental problems contradicted her 1993 testimony and the information\n\nthat she had provided in the 1988 Psychological Report. Furthermore, Sandra Price testified\n\nthat Sadie did not drink or abuse drugs. The court concluded that “a mother’s testimony\n\nwould be somewhat suspect and totally biased in favor of her child facing the death penalty.”\n\n¶84.   As for Sandra Price’s testimony, the trial court found that the sympathy that she may\n\nhave generated for Doss would have been offset by her testimony that she believed Doss had\n\nnot murdered anyone. Further, the court also found that the jury would have been concerned\n\nby her testimony that Doss’ actions may have triggered the home invasion.\n\n¶85.   The trial court also found that the testimony of Q.T. Doss and Sam Phillips would not\n\nhave swayed the jury to impose a sentence other than death. The trial court concluded that\n\nQ.T. Doss’ testimony “would have indicated to the jury that Anthony was making a\n\nconscious decision to associate with persons of bad character.” The trial court also found\n\n\n                                             52\n\fthat Phillips’s testimony that Anthony would have been better off raised in his household was\n\npure speculation.\n\n¶86.   After reviewing the evidence presented at the 2006 hearing, the trial court concluded\n\nin a thorough, thirty-seven-page opinion that the jury still would have sentenced Doss to\n\ndeath. After reviewing the record, I cannot say that the trial court’s findings of fact are\n\nclearly erroneous. Bailey certainly undertook a reasonable investigation that yielded little\n\nmitigation evidence. Doss and Sadie (along with the seven family members when Winbush\n\ninterviewed) failed to disclose any details of Doss’ life in Chicago, and Doss failed to exhibit\n\nany mental deficiencies. Under Strickland, the “reasonableness of an investigative decision\n\n“is substantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or actions.” Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 689, 691.\n\n¶87.   Furthermore, I do not find that there is a reasonable probability that, but for Bailey’s\n\n(alleged) errors, the outcome would have been different. While the evidence presented in\n\n2006 would have garnered some sympathy, it also would have acted as a double-edged sword\n\nby referencing Doss’ propensity for violence and substance abuse.

Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111957\"><a href=\"/opinion/111957/burger-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 791-95 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111957\"><a href=\"/opinion/111957/burger-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Furthermore, the majority\n\naffords no deference to the trial court’s findings of fact, and in my opinion, has improperly\n\nreweighed the evidence to conclude with hindsight that Doss received ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel. I would affirm the trial court’s judgment that Doss received effective assistance\n\nof counsel at the penalty phase of this trial.\n\n       CARLSON, P.J., RANDOLPH AND PIERCE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n\n       GRAVES, PRESIDING JUSTICE, DISSENTING TO PART TWO:\n\n                                                 53\n\fII. WHETHER THE DECISION IN ATKINS v. VIRGINIA REQUIRES THAT THE\nDEATH SENTENCE IN THIS CASE BE SET ASIDE.\n\n¶88.   The majority of this Court relies on an incomplete and admittedly partially inaccurate\n\nreport from the State Hospital at Whitfield (the Whitfield Report) to find that Anthony Doss\n\nis not mentally retarded pursuant to Atkins v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The majority acknowledges in footnote 6 that it is “speaking in terms of the report’s\n\ncontents,” despite testimony offered to correct, clarify and complete the report. Further, this\n\nreport clearly states that it was written without the experts being able to contact numerous\n\npeople and without benefit of substantial, relevant information.            The report says:\n\n“[H]owever, these attempts were unsuccessful at the time this report was written. Although\n\nwe requested more complete school records for Mr. Doss, the psychological testing report\n\nand raw data from North Mississippi Medical Center, and the raw data from a prior\n\npsychological evaluation by Dr. Gelbort, we had not received those records at the time this\n\nreport was written.” The report later says: “However, this opinion is limited by a lack of\n\navailable records related to Mr. Doss’ school history and other prior intellectual assessments,\n\nas well as obstacles encountered when attempting to assess adaptive functioning in\n\nindividuals who have been on death row for an extended period of time.” I write separately\n\n\n\n\n       18\n         The Whitfield Report finds that Doss obtained a full scale IQ score of 71. However,\nDr. Gilbert McVaugh conceded at trial that he made a scoring error and that the correct full-\nscale score should have been 70.\n\n                                              54\n\fbecause I submit that an analysis of the entire record and applicable law is necessary to\n\ndecide this issue.\n\n¶90.   In Chase v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1844462\"><a href=\"/opinion/1844462/chase-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miss. 2004), this Court clarified the application\n\nof Atkins in the trial courts as follows:\n\n               The Atkins majority cited, with approval, two specific, almost identical,\n       definitions of \"mental retardation.\" The first was provided by the American\n       Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR):\n\n                      Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in\n              present functioning. It is characterized by significantly\n              subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with\n              related limitations in two or more of the following applicable\n              adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, community use,\n              self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure,\n              and work. Mental retardation manifests before age 18.\n\n       Atkins, 536 U.S. at 308 n.3, citing Mental Retardation: Definition,\n       Classification, and Systems of Support 5 (9th ed. 1992). The second was\n       provided by The American Psychiatric Association:\n\n                      The essential feature of Mental Retardation is\n              significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\n              (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in\n              adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas:\n              communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal\n              skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional\n              academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B).\n              The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C). Mental\n              Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a\n              final common pathway of various pathological processes that\n              affect the functioning of the central nervous system.\" Diagnostic\n              and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 39 (4th ed. 2000).\n\n       Id.\n\n              The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, from which\n       the American Psychiatric Association definition is quoted, further states that\n       \"mild\" mental retardation is typically used to describe persons with an IQ level\n       of 50-55 to approximately 70. Id. at 42-43. The Manual further provides,\n\n                                              55\n\fhowever, that mental retardation may, under certain conditions, be present in\nan individual with an IQ of up to75. [n.18] Id. at 40. Additionally, according\nto the Atkins majority, \"it is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the\npopulation has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically\nconsidered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental\nretardation definition.\" Id. citing 2 Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive\nTextbook of Psychiatry 2952 (B. Sadock & V. Sadock eds 7th ed. 2000)\n(emphasis added).\n\n       n.18 This point is conceded by the State. However, IQ, alone,\n       does not determine mental retardation. According to the DSM-\n       IV, \"it is possible to diagnose Mental Retardation in individuals\n       with IQ's between 70 and 75 who exhibit significant deficits in\n       adaptive behavior. Conversely, Mental Retardation would not be\n       diagnosed in an individual with an IQ lower than 70 if there are\n       no significant deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning.\n\n       These definitions were previously adopted and approved by this Court\nin Foster v.

The trial judge will make such\ndetermination, by a preponderance of the evidence, after receiving evidence\npresented by the defendant and the State.\n\n        n.19 Although this Court has identified the MMPI-II as a test\n       that should be given, we now clarify our position by stating that\n       the expert should use the MMPI-II, and/or any other tests and\n       procedures permitted under the Mississippi Rules of Evidence,\n       and deemed necessary to assist the expert and the trial court in\n       forming an opinion as to whether the defendant is malingering.\n\n       Procedure to be used.\n\n\n\n                                       56\n\f              Having established the definition of mental retardation to be used for\n       purposes of Eighth Amendment protection to mentally retarded defendants, we\n       now turn to the procedure to be used in reaching a determination of mental retardation.\n\n              We hold that no defendant may be adjudged mentally retarded for\n       purposes of the Eighth Amendment, unless such defendant produces, at a\n       minimum, an expert who expresses an opinion, to a reasonable degree of\n       certainty, that:\n\n                     1. The defendant is mentally retarded, as that term is\n              defined by the American Association on Mental Retardation\n              and/or The American Psychiatric Association;\n\n                      2.

Doss underwent a psychological evaluation at the University of Mississippi in 1988\n\npursuant to a youth-court proceeding. Despite the majority’s assertion that “Doss had at least\n\n\n                                                 57\n\ftwo prior psychological evaluations at the age of fifteen, neither of which resulted in a\n\ndiagnosis of mental retardation,” the record indicates that Doss was “to be evaluated for\n\npossible drug problems which may be contributing to his behavior” and not for the purpose\n\nof determining if he was mentally retarded pursuant to Atkins. More significantly, despite\n\nthe majority’s statement that “[t]hese evaluations found that Doss did not demonstrate\n\ndeficits consistent with mental retardation . . . ,” there was absolutely no finding that Doss\n\nis not mentally retarded pursuant to Atkins. Notwithstanding the purpose for which Doss\n\nwas evaluated, the report from this evaluation indicated as follows: 1) On the Wide Range\n\nAchievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R), Doss achieved a sixth-grade level in Arithmetic and\n\nbelow a third-grade level in reading and spelling; 2) on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for\n\nChildren-Revised (WISC-R), Doss obtained a verbal scale IQ of 67, placing him in a\n\nmentally deficient intelligence classification, a performance scale of 80, placing him in a\n\nlow-average intelligence classification, and a full scale of 71, placing him in a borderline\n\nclassification of intelligence; 3) “The Bender Motor Gestalt Motor Test revealed that there\n\nmay be some organic basis to Anthony’s difficulties,” as Doss showed poor planning,\n\nperceptual difficulties, inattentiveness and a hurried approach to tasks; 4) the Millon\n\nAdolescent Personality Inventory (MAPI) revealed “no unusual test-taking attitudes that may\n\nhave distorted the MAPI results.” 19\n\n\n       19\n        Another IQ test was administered to Doss at North Mississippi Medical Center that\nproduced a result of 80. However, this test was administered just a few months after the\nUniversity of Mississippi test and was merely an estimated score based on a shortened\nversion of an exam. Dr. Criss Lott, who was contracted by the Mississippi State Hospital\nto assist in the evaluation of Doss, acknowledged that this test was not a true result. Lott\ntestified: “There could possibly be a practice effect there. It was also an estimated IQ. That\n\n                                             58\n\f¶92.   In 2001, Dr. James Merikangas executed an affidavit, which was attached to Doss’\n\napplication for leave filed with this Court, outlining the need for a neuropsychiatric\n\nevaluation on Doss and opining that the University of Mississippi report from 1988 suggests\n\norganic brain damage and mental retardation. Doss also attached the affidavit of Jeffrey Eno,\n\na clinical and forensic social worker, to his application for leave. Eno provided a life history\n\nof Doss, including prenatal history, exposure to lead paint chips, details of his violent,\n\nabusive upbringing in a dangerous area, physical injuries, substance abuse, and history of\n\nmental issues within the family.\n\n¶93.   In 2003, Dr. Michael Gelbort performed a neuropsychological evaluation of Doss at\n\nParchman, during which the following tests were administered: Wechsler Adult Intelligence\n\nScale-III, Wechsler Memory Scale-III subtests, Wide Range Achievement Test-III, Lateral\n\nDominance Examination, Strength of Grip, Trail Making Test, Category Test, items from the\n\nLuria Nebraska, and diagnostic interview with mental status testing. Gelbort’s report, which\n\nwas attached as an exhibit to his application for leave, indicated as follows:\n\n       Intellectual testing found Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores of 68,\n       79, and 71, respectively. These scores are virtually identical to those obtained\n       in the distant past and lend weight to the opinion that the patient put forth\n       appropriate effort, as well as that his intellectual functioning is in the\n       borderline mentally retarded range and that he qualifies, in terms of intellectual\n       impairment, for a diagnosis of Mental Retardation.\n\n\n\n\nis, they only gave four subtests. So it is not a full IQ. It wasn’t a full evaluation in terms of\nusing the full test itself. It was only four subtests.” Based on these factors and others\ntestified to at trial, the validity of this result is not reliable.\n\n\n                                                  59\n\fExhibit HH, Application for Leave to File Motion to Vacate Judgment and Sentence, 1999-\n\nDR-296 (May 20, 2003). Gelbort’s impressions were:\n\n       Consistent with the past test results, Mr. Doss presents with a Full Scale IQ\n       score between the second and third percentile qualifying him for a diagnosis\n       of Mental Retardation. A clinical social worker is collecting information about\n       Mr. Doss and investigating the other issues involved in making a definitive\n       diagnosis. In any event, the patient is showing clear and consistent\n       impairments in frontal lobe functioning and bilateral temporal lobe functioning\n       with notable impairments in reasoning, judgment, problem solving, and all\n       types of new learning and memory skills. Based on the current evaluation and\n       historical information reviewed, Mr. Doss does qualify and is diagnosed with\n       Organic Brain Dysfunction, also diagnosed as Cognitive Disorder NOS based\n       upon other nosological systems. The data and historical information reflect\n       that these deficits are likely both congenital and acquired at an early age,\n       predate the event for which he was tried and convicted, and were as readily\n       and easily observed and diagnosed at the time of his original trial as they are\n       at this point in time. They have a significant impact and effect on his behavior\n       with the patient having impairments in the abilities of problem solving and\n       reasoning, as well as anticipating the consequences of his behavior and\n       planning adaptively and effectively into the future because of his\n       neurocognitive impairments.\n\nExhibit HH, Application for Leave to File Motion to Vacate Judgment and Sentence, 1999-\n\nDR-296 (May 20, 2003).\n\n¶94.   While acknowledging the State’s questions concerning Doss’ claims, this Court\n\ngranted Doss leave to present his Atkins claim before the trial court. The trial court\n\nappointed the Mississippi State Hospital to make a determination of whether Doss is mentally\n\nretarded. Doss was examined by Drs. Gilbert MacVaugh III, Criss Lott, John Montgomery,\n\nand Reb McMichael in November 2005. At the evidentiary hearing, Doss called Dr. Lott,\n\nwho was contracted by the Mississippi State Hospital to assist in the evaluation of Doss, Dr.\n\nDaniel Grant, and Dr. Timothy Summers as witnesses. The State called Drs. MacVaugh and\n\nMcMichael, employees of the Mississippi State Hospital, as witnesses.\n\n\n                                             60\n\f¶95.   Doss was administered the Stanford Binet Fifth Edition test by Grant on May 5-6,\n\n2005. Doss’ full-scale IQ score was 62. Doss was administered the Wechsler Adult\n\nIntelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) during the evaluation at the Mississippi State Hospital\n\n(Whitfield) on November 2, 2005. Doss received a corrected full-scale IQ score of 70 on the\n\nWAIS-III, which is a standardized test of adult intelligence.\n\n¶96.   Experts for both the State and the defendant agree that Doss meets the first criterion\n\nof significantly subaverage intellectual functioning manifested before age eighteen.20 Lott\n\ntestified repeatedly that he agreed that the testing of Doss meets the first criterion, that Doss\n\nhas significantly subaverage intellectual functioning that was manifested before age eighteen.\n\nLott also testified that Doss had scored low consistently over the years with the exception of\n\nthe estimated IQ in 1988, which Lott acknowledged was not a true result. See supra note\n\n3. MacVaugh testified, in relevant part: “The, the range of scores on IQ test for mild mental\n\nretardation is approximately 70 to 50 to 55. So I think that is the range that we are talking\n\nabout here in Mr. Doss’ case.” MacVaugh also testified that Doss meets the intellectual-\n\nimpairment prong of Atkins. “But in a forensic context, particularly this case, with the\n\ncriteria set forth by Chase and Atkins, I think he does satisfy the cognitive or intellectual\n\n\n\n\n       20\n         Because there is no question that Doss meets the first prong of significantly\nsubaverage intellectual functioning, the majority’s discussion regarding malingering is\nunnecessary and irrelevant. Moreover, the majority’s statement that “[t]he evaluation stated\nthat [Doss’] true IQ score may have been higher, but possible malingering or fatigue may\nhave factored in the scoring,” is incomplete. While the report did say Doss’ score may be\nhigher, it also said Doss’ true score may be three points less, or 67. Testimony also indicated\nthat Doss’ score could be considerably less. Further, the report specifically said fatigue may\nhave factored into Doss’ score on one measure of malingered memory deficits, i.e., TOMM,\nbut also that Doss was cooperative and put forth a good effort.\n\n                                               61\n\fimpairment prong of Atkins. So I don’t – I think he does have mild mental retardation in\n\nterms of the intellectual impairment prong of the diagnosis.”\n\n¶97.   As Doss meets the first prong of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\n\nmanifested before age eighteen, the relevant issue is then whether Doss has related or\n\nsignificant deficits in adaptive functioning. Adaptive-skill areas are communication, self-\n\ncare, functional academics, community use, self-direction, health and safety, leisure, and\n\nwork. The record indicates that Doss does have related or significant deficits in adaptive\n\nfunctioning.21\n\n¶98.   Grant administered a standardized test to assist in a determination of Doss’ adaptive-\n\nskills functioning. Grant testified:\n\n       Q.      Okay. Okay. The – in terms of adaptive functioning what are your\n       conclusions about, about that issue?\n       A.      I feel that he has deficits at adaptive functioning.\n       Q.      Okay. In what areas?\n       A.      I looked at it from two different points of view. I looked at it from the\n       skills he has on the language area, his language skills are – showed significant\n       deficits. And his academic skills showed significant deficits. And those two\n       areas would fit within – would show – one way of showing that he met poor\n       adaptive behavior. As they said, two sets of deviations below the means in\n       those two areas.\n               And I also administered the adaptive – the independent living skills.\n       And the norms for that test for this group is – the means score is – the mean\n       age score is 34, which is what his age is. So I mean he had a score of – a full\n       scale score of 65.\n       Q.      Okay.\n\n\n\n\n       21\n         The majority discounts findings in the record that establish Doss’ adaptive-skills\ndeficits because these findings rely on interviews with Doss. However, the findings in the\nWhitfield Report substantially rely on interviews with Doss as well. Also, the findings in\nthe Whitfield Report rely on interviews with Sadie Doss, yet the report notes that Sadie has\npreviously been tested and received an IQ score in the mentally retarded range.\n\n                                              62\n\f       A.     And if you notice, he had some, some better scores, some lower scores.\n       And retarded individuals are no different than the rest of us. They have\n       strengths. They have weaknesses. And he had some strengths and some\n       weaknesses in different variables.\n       Q.     In the full scale standard score of 65, why does that lead you to\n       conclude he has got deficits in adaptive functioning?\n       A.     Because it’s more than two sets of deviations below the mean. It also\n       is consistent – these scores are consistent across all these variables. Almost\n       every test I gave him was within a few points of that score.\n       Q.     The number 65 here, is that on the adaptive – the independent living\n       scales test or the equivalent of 65 on an IQ test?\n       A.     Right. With 100 being average.\n\n¶99.   Grant further testified that Doss also had exhibited significant deficits with regard to\n\nfunctional academics, work, and communication. Moreover, Grant concluded that Doss\n\nsuffered from organic brain dysfunction, which could have been impacted by the head\n\ninjuries. Grant testified:\n\n       Impaired brain. He has problems with attention, problems with concentration.\n       He has nystagmus, moving of the eyes. He has a thin lip, peculiarity of the\n       nose, which is typical in people that have fetal alcohol syndrome. He has – he\n       has concrete thinking. He has problems with memory, problems with – his\n       reasoning was concrete.\n\n¶100. Summers also testified that Doss has significant deficits in adaptive functioning.\n\nSpecifically, Summers said:\n\n              Well, in my opinion, first of all, if you look at communication issues for\n       one, he certainly has adaptive deficits in communication primarily because\n       number one, he is inattentive. Number two, he is impulsive. Number three,\n       he is mistrustful. Number four, he has difficulty processing. Number five, his\n       general fund of knowledge is poor. Number six, he has difficulty with abstract\n       thinking. Number seven, his memory is poor, particularly his working\n       memory.\n              If you gave him a problem that involved his remembering a certain\n       amount, amount of information that he could later on use to render a decision,\n       he wasn’t able to do that. And his, his general – and then he would rush into\n       solutions very fast without really giving a lot of thought to it. So he was – he\n       was very difficult for me to understand him.\n\n\n                                              63\n\f             And so finally I had to just finally say wait a minute. Okay. This is\n       what we are here for. This is what I want you to focus on. This is what we are\n       going to talk about. And so he has significant problems as it relates to\n       communication. He thinks nobody loves him. He thinks nobody cares about\n       him. He thinks that –\n\n¶101. Summers also testified that Doss had significant deficits in academic functioning,\n\nabstract reasoning, social skills, and interpersonal relations, and that these deficiencies were\n\nrelated to his subaverage intellectual functioning.\n\n       Q.      Let me ask you this. Do the – you mentioned in your report some areas\n       of limitations and adaptive functioning. Do you, you believe those stem from\n       and are related to the subaverage intellectual functioning that was already\n       discussed?\n       A.      Absolutely. I mean – see, it doesn’t matter if your intellectual\n       functioning is low because you have head trauma or toxicity to your brain or\n       if your intellectual functioning is low because you lived in an impoverished\n       environment. The end result is still the same.\n               But in my opinion, you know, Anthony has had so much, so many\n       problems, so many issues to his brain. I mean he has had – I mean number\n       one, he started out with a mom who was drinking every day. Then number\n       two, she was kicked in the abdomen when she was pregnant to the point that\n       she bled so much that she had to go to the hospital.\n               Number three, when Anthony was a little boy then he had lead toxicity.\n       Then after that he had measles at two. And then after that he developed\n       multiple head trauma - baseball bats, sticks, hit in the head with a pistol.\n               So, you know, when you get through looking at all those different\n       issues then – now, in addition to that, you also have the psycho-social issues\n       that affect the brain.\n\n¶102. Lott testified that he did not use a standardized test to measure adaptive functioning,\n\nbut that he reviewed Grant’s report, which was based on a standardized test. Lott further\n\ntestified that it is very hard to assess what someone’s adaptive functioning was twenty years\n\nago. Lott discounted the use of the standardized test because he said there have been no\n\nstudies that norm the test for people on death row.\n\n\n\n\n                                              64\n\f¶103. Most significantly, Lott testified that he relies on the tenth edition of the AAMR\n\ndefinition, but not in this case.\n\n       Q.      I want to show you the book, 10th edition of the book called Mental\n       Retardation, Definition, Classification, Assistance and Support by the\n       American Association of Mental Retardation. Are you familiar with this\n       book?\n       A.      Yes.\n       Q.      Okay. Is it a book that you rely on?\n       A.      Yes.\n       Q.      Okay. I want to show you a page, eight, it’s called Assumption 1 and\n       just a couple of sentences. And I want to ask you about it. Limitations in\n       present functioning must be considered within the context of community\n       environments typical of the individual’s age, peers and culture. This means\n       the standards against which the individual’s functioning must be measured are\n       typically community-based environments, not environments that are isolated\n       or segregated by ability.\n               Doesn’t that suggest that it is unnecessary to norm a test for someone\n       in an environment that is isolated or segregated like a prison?\n       A.      Well, you would norm it. When you say it’s unnecessary to norm it, I\n       am not sure what you mean by not needed. We, we, we certainly rely on\n       norms. That is the way we interpret measures. It would not be appropriate for\n       us to use any test that had not been adequately normed.\n       Q.      Right.\n       A.      So I’m not sure exactly where you are going with that question.\n       Q.      In your report, at the bottom of Page 31, the very last paragraph, you,\n       you, you say that there is standardized assessment interests – assessment\n       instruments for measuring adaptive functioning. And then you go on to say\n       such instruments have not been standardized for use with offenders who have\n       been incarcerated for a number of years, particularly those on death row. Then\n       you go on to say that administration of a standardized instrument to measure\n       adaptive skills with a death row inmate would yield invalid results.\n               But given what the – what the AAMR says about the need to measure\n       someone in terms of the community at-large rather than segregated or isolated\n       environment, can’t a test like this yield valid results even though it has not\n       been standardized for use with people on death row?\n       A.      It would certainly be possible if you had adequate measures here and\n       adequate population for us to look at. It is very difficult, I think, to take a test\n       like this and to go into death row and ask someone there questions about a\n       defendant’s behavior. And they, they don’t have access. They have limited\n       access on death row to these kinds of activities and behaviors.\n\n\n\n                                               65\n\f               Are we assessing at 20? Are we assessing their deficits prior to the age\n       of 18? I think that is the issue here. What do they look like prior to 18?\n       That’s, that’s the criteria. They have to meet this deficit – these deficit areas\n       prior to the age of 18. Now, it still remains difficult. I think it is questionable\n       as to whether or not we can do that and how adequately and correctly we can\n       do that.\n       ...\n       Q.      But the fact that – I mean the fact that it was not normed on the people\n       on death row is not by itself important given the fact that it has been normed\n       with the general population, which is what the AAMR says is important; is that\n       correct?\n       A.      I think you are correct in that a test can be appropriate. For instance,\n       the IQ test that we all use, it wasn’t normed on death row inmates and we use\n       that routinely. It’s though how adequate that measure is in collecting or\n       obtaining information that you are looking for. An IQ test that we use for the\n       inmates on death row is the same IQ test I use in disability evaluations every\n       day. There is not a specific set of norms for those IQ, IQ results that I get just\n       for death row inmates.\n       Q.      Okay.\n       A.      Okay. I understand that, and I agree with you. The problem though is\n       getting reliable data. . . .\n               There are a number of tests that we would use that have been normed\n       elsewhere that aren’t normed for death row inmates, a number of them. It is\n       just taking that data that we obtained for this instrument and then interpreting\n       it. I think that remains a big problem in this area.\n\n¶104. Lott acknowledged that Doss’ history is significant for several risk factors that are\n\ncorrelated with the development of mental retardation, including childhood abuse; abuse of\n\nthe mother during pregnancy; social and cultural deprivation during infancy, childhood, and\n\ninto adolescence; the ingestion of lead paint; neglect; possible malnutrition; head injuries;\n\nand limitations in functional academics. However, Lott dismissed these factors as not related\n\nto Doss’ mental retardation.\n\n       Q.    Now, you said that on the surface Mr. Doss’s history might seem to\n       suggest he has demonstrated limitations in some areas of adaptive skills in the\n       community, i.e., functional academics, work, self direction, health and safety.\n       Now, if these things were not related to mental retardation, what were they\n       caused by?\n\n\n                                               66\n\f       A.    By growing up in an environment where one isn’t supervised, one isn’t\n       monitored, one isn’t nurtured, a lot of neglect and possible abuse.\n\n¶105. Lott acknowledged that limitations in these adaptive skills, even in a person who is\n\nnot mentally retarded, substantially impact a person and can affect judgment. Lott testified\n\nthat most of the basis for finding that Doss was not retarded came from unverified or\n\nunexplained information provided by Doss. Lott said that some of the information was\n\n“corroborated in part by family about his ability to maintain independent or close to\n\nindependent living, developmentally speaking, early on.” Lott specifically mentioned Doss\n\nhelping his mother when he was eight or nine years old. Sadie also testified that Doss and\n\nhis brother had helped her. However, the record does not establish that Doss did anything\n\nsubstantial to help his mother or anything that would establish that he had no deficiencies in\n\nadaptive skills before age eighteen.\n\n¶106. MacVaugh’s testimony was similar to Lott’s. MacVaugh dismissed Doss’ deficits in\n\nthe adaptive areas of functional academics and work because “we had enough data to suggest\n\nthat his apparent deficits in those areas were due to his personality attributes, his various\n\nbehavioral problems, substance abuse and other factors that together we would consider\n\nmaladaptive behavior, not adaptive deficit the way a mental retardation diagnosis requires\n\n. . . .” MacVaugh also discussed Doss’ apparent ability to work as a drug dealer. However,\n\ntestimony at trial established that Doss was merely following instructions of others and was\n\noften assisted by his brother. MacVaugh also offered the following testimony on the\n\nconfusion regarding the relationship of adaptive deficits to the significant intellectual\n\nimpairment:\n\n\n\n                                             67\n\f               Sure. We as clinicians, think, or at least on our service, maybe I\n       shouldn’t speak for my colleagues and should limit this to my own opinion\n       about this, really interpret the definition of mental retardation that consists of\n       the two prongs of intellectual impairment and adaptive functioning impairment\n       as being more than just coexisting. I mean there has to be some relationship\n       between those domains of impairment.\n               And really the, the view that we have taken in this in order to help us\n       understand this better because it is so difficult to assess, particularly someone\n       who has a history like Mr. Doss, who on the surface may look like they have\n       some of these adaptive deficits but with further analysis there are reasons why\n       that might better explain why they look that way historically.\n               The issue is whether or not these deficits in adaptive functioning are\n       due to the significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. This is an issue\n       that is very controversial. It has not been explicitly clear in any of the major\n       documents that we rely on in doing our evaluations. . . .\n               There is no national consensus about what the interpretation is about\n       that, what the approach is to the assessment on that point and that evaluators\n       do lots of different things. It is very variable in terms of how you are\n       approaching the issue. Are the deficits supposed to be due to the intellectual\n       deficits, or do they just somehow coexist?\n               My own view on that is the reason why it is not clear in the AAMR\n       definition or DSM definition is because when these definitions were written,\n       it was impossible to anticipate that these definitions would be under the\n       microscope in a death penalty case one day because these were written pre-\n       Atkins so there was no reason to make that explicitly clear that the intellectual\n       deficits are more than related to the adaptive deficits, that the adaptive deficits\n       should be due to the intellectual deficits.\n               For example, if somebody is leaving the stove on is it because they have\n       such a severe memory impairment because they forgot to turn it off? Now, that\n       is an example of self-care adaptive deficit that is due to a significant\n       intellectual deficit. Whereas if somebody has an intellectual deficit but, you\n       know, doesn’t show some related adaptive deficits related to the intellectual\n       impairments then I question whether that is actually adaptive functioning\n       deficits.\n\n¶107. The testimony of both Lott and MacVaugh was similar to the Whitfield report, which\n\nsaid, in part:\n\n       On the surface, Mr. Doss’ history might seem to suggest that he has\n       demonstrated limitations in some areas of adaptive skills in the community\n       (i.e., functional academics, work, self-direction, health, and safety). However,\n       it is our opinion that these apparent difficulties may be better explained by his\n\n\n                                               68\n\f       history of neglect, abuse and maladaptive behaviors, since they did not appear\n       to stem from severe intellectual deficits.\n\n¶108. The Whitfield report also said:\n\n              It is noted that Mr. Doss [sic] history is significant for several risk\n       factors that are correlated with the development of mental retardation. For\n       example, during her pregnancy with Mr. Doss, Ms. Doss reportedly abused\n       alcohol regularly, was prescribed valium (anti-anxiety medication), was\n       “kicked” in the stomach . . . leading to blood loss and hospital attention, and\n       reportedly contracted a venereal disease during pregnancy. Mr. Doss also\n       reportedly tested positive for lead poisoning due to exposure to chipping paint\n       as a child. Moreover, Mr. Doss reported (and medical records confirm) that\n       he also has had multiple head injuries over the years.\n\n¶109. The report then discounts these risk factors for mental retardation based on the prior\n\npsychological evaluations at the age of fifteen and on a ninth-grade class ranking. However,\n\nthe report previously acknowledged that Doss had scored in the borderline mentally retarded\n\nrange as an adolescent. Further, as stated previously herein, Doss was never evaluated as an\n\nadolescent for the purpose of determining whether he was mentally retarded pursuant to\n\nAtkins.     Moreover, while Doss was ranked 681 out of 850 students, the report also\n\nacknowledges that Doss passed only one out of five subjects that year, while failing the\n\nothers.22\n\n¶110. The Whitfield report further said that despite Doss’ IQ, his “apparent difficulties [in\n\nadaptive skills] may be better explained by his history of neglect, abuse, and maladaptive\n\nbehaviors, since they did not appear to stem from severe intellectual deficits.” (Emphasis\n\n\n\n\n       22\n        Records indicate Doss passed Pre-Algebra with Support, which apparently consisted\nof two separate classes, including one with individualized assistance by a special education\nteacher. Doss failed Introduction to High School English, General Science, Art, and\nPhysical Education.\n\n                                             69\n\fadded.) The report also said that “there were no data that suggested Mr. Doss has ever\n\ndemonstrated significant deficits in adaptive functioning due to the effects of subaverage\n\nintellectual functioning.” 23 (Emphasis added.) However, there is no requirement in the\n\ndefinitions set out previously herein that the deficits in adaptive functioning must be “due to\n\nthe effects of subaverage intellectual functioning,” much less that the adaptive deficits “stem\n\nfrom severe intellectual deficits.”\n\n¶111. The AAMR definition for mental retardation, as set out previously herein, states\n\n“significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related\n\nlimitations in two or more” adaptive-skill areas. Atkins, 536 U.S. at 308. The American\n\nPsychiatric Association’s definition, also set out previously herein, states “significantly\n\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning . . . that is accompanied by significant limitations\n\nin adaptive functioning in at least two” of the skill areas. Id. Also, as noted previously,\n\naccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, \"it is possible to\n\ndiagnose Mental Retardation in individuals with IQ's between 70 and 75 who exhibit\n\nsignificant deficits in adaptive behavior. Conversely, Mental Retardation would not be\n\ndiagnosed in an individual with an IQ lower than 70 if there are no significant deficits or\n\nimpairments in adaptive functioning.”\n\n¶112. In Rivera v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"52887\"><a href=\"/opinion/52887/rivera-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2007), the Fifth Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals upheld the federal district court’s finding regarding related limitations in adaptive\n\n\n       23\n         The Whitfield report further states the “opinion is limited by a lack of available\nrecords related to Mr. Doss’ school history and other prior intellectual assessments, as well\nas obstacles encountered when attempting to assess adaptive functioning in individuals who\nhave been on death row for an extended period of time.”\n\n                                              70\n\ffunctioning despite the State’s argument that Rivera’s adaptive deficits may have been\n\nattributable to his abuse of inhalants and not to his mental retardation. In noting that the\n\ndistrict court had acknowledged that Rivera’s adaptive deficits were just as likely to have\n\nbeen caused by his long-term drug abuse as his diminished intellectual capacity, the Fifth\n\nCircuit Court said:\n\n              We read this quote charitably, in support of the district court’s own\n       ruling. The district court was likely distinguishing only between etiologies,\n       remarking that some of the deficits were caused by mental retardation from\n       inhalants, and some were caused by mental retardation from other factors.\n       Retardation has, as the experts in this case all agreed, a number of etiologies.\n\nRivera, 505 F. 3d at 363. The Court then quoted the applicable language from Atkins, as\n\nfollows: “Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final\n\ncommon pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central\n\nnervous system.” Atkins, 536 U.S. at 308 n.3.\n\n¶113. Clearly, mental retardation is: 1) subaverage intellectual functioning; 2) accompanied\n\nby related or significant limitations in two adaptive-skill areas; and 3) manifested before age\n\neighteen. Doss has significantly 1) subaverage intellectual functioning; 2) accompanied by\n\nrelated or significant limitations in two adaptive-skill areas; and 3) it manifested prior to age\n\neighteen. Therefore, the inescapable conclusion is that Doss is mentally retarded. Under the\n\napplicable law and based on the facts of this case, it would be illogical to reach any other\n\nconclusion.\n\n¶114. Moreover, the State’s experts testified that Doss was evaluated under the ninth edition\n\nof the AAMR pursuant to Atkins, and that they were under the mistaken belief that they were\n\nrequired to use this older definition of adaptive functioning rather than that contained in the\n\n                                               71\n\ftenth edition from 2002, which they used in their respective clinical practices. MacVaugh\n\nfurther admitted that using the more current tenth edition to evaluate Doss “could possibly\n\nchange the diagnosis because the assessment of adaptive skill deficits would, would look\n\ndifferent because the definition for them is different conceptually.” Therefore, even though\n\nthe majority finds that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of mental\n\nretardation, this matter still should be remanded for an additional evidentiary hearing to allow\n\nthe State’s experts the opportunity to re-evaluate Doss pursuant to the current definition of\n\nadaptive functioning.\n\n¶115. Because I would find that there is sufficient evidence to establish that Doss is mentally\n\nretarded or, in the alternative, that he should be re-evaluated pursuant to the tenth edition, I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n       KITCHENS, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n\n\n\n\n                                              72\n\f</pre>",
