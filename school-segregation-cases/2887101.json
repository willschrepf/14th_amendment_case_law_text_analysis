Macia, a federal inmate presently confined at FCI-Allenwood,\n\nPennsylvania, appeals the District Court’s dismissal of his § 2241 petition in which he\n\nchallenged the disciplinary proceeding and sanctions imposed following his escape from a\n\ffederal open prison facility in Florida in June 2004.\n\n       The facts are well known to the parties and will not be repeated at length here. At\n\nhis disciplinary hearing on June 29, 2004, Macia waived staff representation and admitted\n\nthat he escaped from the open prison. The disciplinary hearing officer found Macia guilty\n\nof escape and sanctioned him with twenty-seven days loss of good-time, fourteen days of\n\ndisciplinary segregation and a disciplinary transfer. On July 19, 2004, Macia learned that\n\nthe Deputy Marshal was investigating his escape for possible criminal prosecution.\n\nMacia was charged with escape for which he pled guilty, and was sentenced to fifteen\n\nmonths’ imprisonment to run consecutively to the sentence he was then serving.\n\n       Macia filed a § 2241 petition in 2005, claiming that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)\n\nviolated his Constitutional rights and its own policy when it did not suspend disciplinary\n\naction pending the criminal investigation of his escape and subsequent prosecution.\n\nMacia also contends that the disciplinary hearing officer violated his due process rights\n\nand BOP policy when he failed to advise Macia of his due process rights at the\n\ndisciplinary hearing. He asserts that the hearing officer wrongfully induced Macia to\n\nwaive his right to be represented by a staff representative and to plead guilty to the\n\ndisciplinary charge on the false promise that Macia would not be criminally prosecuted.\n\nMacia complains that his disciplinary transfer to a medium high security facility was\n\nvindictive and excessive. He seeks expungement of the incident report and sanctions\n\nfrom his prison record and an order reprimanding the disciplinary hearing officer for\n\n\n                                              2\n\fdisregarding the intent of the BOP regulations.\n\n       After reviewing the petition and responsive pleadings, the District Court denied §\n\n2241 relief.1 The District Court held that the BOP did not violate its own regulations and\n\nthat, even if it did, Macia failed to show that he was prejudiced. The District Court also\n\nheld that Macia failed to present any evidence supporting his claim that his waiver of his\n\nright to representation was based on the false promise of non-prosecution. The District\n\nCourt ruled that the BOP did not violate due process in denying Macia representation in\n\nany event because Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), provides a right to staff\n\nrepresentation at a prison disciplinary hearing only when the inmate is illiterate or the\n\nissue to be adjudicated is complex. The District Court decided that Macia’s case did not\n\nmeet the Wolff criteria. The District Court held that there was more than some evidence\n\nto support the disciplinary hearing officer’s finding of guilt based on the undisputed fact\n\nthat Macia left the institution (FPC-Pensacola) on June 9, 2004. In addition, the District\n\nCourt determined that the sanctions imposed were not excessive because they fell well\n\nwithin the BOP Guidelines for high level offenses set forth at 28 C.F.R. § 541.13, tables 3\n\nand 4. The District Court also held that Macia’s claim challenging his current\n\ninstitutional placement and custody classification was not properly brought in a habeas\n\ncorpus petition because it related to the conditions of prison confinement, rather than the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        The District Court also denied Macia’s motion for appointment of counsel and\ndismissed his summary judgment motion .\n\n                                              3\n\ffact or duration of his sentence. Macia timely appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction to review the dismissal of Macia’s petition pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s legal\n\nconclusions as no evidentiary hearing was conducted by the District Court. See Ruggiano\n\nv. Reish, 307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n       First, we must address whether Macia may contest his disciplinary hearing and\n\nsanctions by means of a habeas corpus petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\nClaims brought under § 2241 must challenge the execution of a sentence, rather than its\n\nvalidity. See Coady v. Vaughn, 251 F.3d 480, 485 (3d Cir. 2001). The precise meaning\n\nof the term “execution of a sentence” has not been determined. As we noted in Woodall\n\nv. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 432 F.3d 235, 242 (3d Cir. 2005), the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecisions in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004), and Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S.\n\n475 (1973), determined that § 1983 provides no remedy in “conditions of confinement”\n\ncases where the claims asserted lie “at the core of habeas.” Id. (also citing Leamer v.\n\nFauver, 288 F.3d 532 (3d Cir. 2002). The Supreme Court, however, did not address when\n\na prisoner is precluded from filing a habeas petition. Woodall, 432 F.3d at 242. In\n\nCoady, we cited United States v. Jalili, 925 F.2d 889, 893 (6th Cir. 1991), for the\n\nproposition that a “challenge to [the] place of imprisonment” is “properly brought under\n\nSection 2241.” 251 F.3d at 485. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has stated\n\nthat “[a] motion pursuant to § 2241 generally challenges the execution of a federal\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fprisoner’s sentence . . . by prison officials, prison disciplinary actions, prison transfers,\n\ntype of detention and prison conditions.” Jiminian v. Nash, 245 F.3d 144, 146 (2d Cir.\n\n2001). We conclude that Macia’s challenges to the disciplinary hearing and the sanctions\n\nimposed, including his disciplinary transfer, affect the manner in which his sentence is\n\nexecuted and are properly brought under § 2241. Upon careful review of the arguments\n\non appeal, we will affirm.\n\n       Macia claims that the BOP violated his Constitutional rights and BOP policy by\n\nfailing to suspend the disciplinary action pending possible criminal prosecution. The\n\ncommencement of prison disciplinary proceedings before the criminal prosecution for\n\nescape did not violate Macia’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Even\n\nrights “basic to a fair hearing” are “necessarily circumscribed by the penological need to\n\nprovide swift discipline in individual cases.” Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S. 491, 495 (1985).\n\nThe prison’s failure to follow its own procedures will not result in a due process violation\n\nas long as the inmate is provided with the process he is due under Wolff v. McDonnell,\n\n418 U.S. 539, 556 (1974).2\n\n       As for Macia’s challenges to the disciplinary hearing proceeding and the sanctions\n\nimposed, Wolff provides a set of minimum procedural protections that must apply to\n\n\n\n       2\n         We note that there is nothing in this record to suggest that the prison violated 28\nC.F.R. § 541.14(b)(1) and BOP Statement 5270.07, entitled “Inmate Discipline and\nSpecial Housing Units,” because the U.S. Marshal released its incident report to the BOP\n“for administrative action” on June 14, 2004, and, thus, there was no basis under BOP\npolicy for suspending the disciplinary action.\n\n                                               5\n\fprison disciplinary proceedings where, as in Macia’s case, a prisoner’s good-time credit is\n\nat stake : “(1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when\n\nconsistent with safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary\n\nevidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence\n\nrelied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.” Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst.,\n\nWalpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985) (citing Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67).\n\n       Turning to Macia’s claim that the disciplinary hearing officer failed to advise him\n\nof his rights on the day of the hearing, the District Court correctly held that the prison and\n\ndisciplinary hearing officer afforded Macia the procedural protections he was due under\n\nWolff. See 418 U.S. at 555-57. The record indicates that Macia received written notice\n\nof the charges against him and was advised of his disciplinary hearing rights in\n\naccordance with Wolff before his hearing. Because Macia had already been advised of\n\nhis hearing rights, the hearing officer was not obligated under Wolff to reiterate those\n\nrights at the hearing.\n\n       As for Macia’s challenge to re-classification and disciplinary transfer, we agree\n\nwith the District Court that these sanctions are well within the BOP guidelines for\n\npunishment. Thus, they do not amount to a constitutional violation.\n\n       We turn to Macia’s last claim, that his admission of guilt at the disciplinary\n\nhearing was not knowing and voluntary because the disciplinary hearing officer induced\n\nhim to waive his rights to staff representation and to a full hearing on a false promise of\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fnon-prosecution. Inmates do not have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in\n\nprison disciplinary hearings. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 570. Although BOP regulations provide\n\nfor staff assistance in certain cases, the lack of such representation in Macia’s case does\n\nnot constitute a due process violation. In any event, as the District Court correctly noted,\n\nthe BOP regulations were not violated because Macia was not illiterate and the issues in\n\nhis case were not complex.\n\n       As for Macia’s contention that the disciplinary hearing officer wrongfully induced\n\nhim to waive his right to a hearing, the District Court held that Macia failed to produce\n\nany evidence to support his claim that the disciplinary hearing officer promised him non-\n\nprosecution in exchange for a guilty plea on the disciplinary charge. Our review of the\n\nrecord, however, reveals what appears to be admissible evidence in support of Macia’s\n\nallegation. Macia submitted an affidavit stating under penalty of perjury that “the\n\nstatement of facts of the case in the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is true and\n\ncorrect.” In his § 2241 petition, Macia states that the disciplinary hearing officer took\n\ninto consideration that Macia “was likely to face criminal prosecution after leaving the\n\n[prison] camp to visit my grieving family after my brother’s suicide” and that Macia had\n\nbeen offered a hardship furlough, as well as Macia’s past record, “to weigh whether I was\n\nto be criminally prosecuted. I was told to waive my rights, not to call witnesses or to\n\ndemand representation to be assured of no criminal charges for a plea of guilty that day.”\n\nSee § 2241 Petition at ¶ 9-A. Macia’s own statement, even if uncorroborated, raises a\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fquestion of fact as to whether he voluntarily waived the right to call witnesses and present\n\ndocumentary evidence in his defense. Normally, an evidentiary hearing would resolve the\n\nfactual issue. No evidentiary hearing is necessary in Macia’s case, however. Even\n\nassuming that Macia’s waiver was wrongfully induced, we conclude that the error was\n\nharmless.3 Putting Macia’s admission aside, there is substantial evidence of his guilt as to\n\nthe prison misconduct charge. Specific evidence relied on by the disciplinary hearing\n\nofficer in finding Macia guilty of the misconduct charge included the report of Officer\n\nMichael that the 10:00 p.m. bed count on June 9, 2004, revealed that Macia was absent\n\nfrom his bunk. See Appellant’s Brief, Exh. 4, § V. Lieutenant Lawson reported that the\n\nbed counts in the rest of the prison that night were normal. Id. A search of the prison\n\ncompound and immediate surrounding area failed to locate Macia. Id. Officers inspected\n\nMacia’s personal locker and bunker areas and found that all of his personal items were\n\ngone. Id. The U.S. Marshal was notified. Id. It is undisputed that Macia was\n\napprehended the next day in Florida, at a location outside of the prison facility.\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         We note at the outset of our harmless error analysis that Macia did not provide to\nthe prison hearing officer, the District Court, or this Court on appeal, the names of the\nwitnesses he would have called or the documentation he would have presented had he not\nwaived his hearing rights.\n                                       8\n\f",

He asserts that the hearing officer wrongfully induced Macia to\n\nwaive his right to be represented by a staff representative and to plead guilty to the\n\ndisciplinary charge on the false promise that Macia would not be criminally prosecuted.\n\nMacia complains that his disciplinary transfer to a medium high security facility was\n\nvindictive and excessive. He seeks expungement of the incident report and sanctions\n\nfrom his prison record and an order reprimanding the disciplinary hearing officer for\n\n\n                                              2\n\fdisregarding the intent of the BOP regulations.\n\n       After reviewing the petition and responsive pleadings, the District Court denied §\n\n2241 relief.1 The District Court held that the BOP did not violate its own regulations and\n\nthat, even if it did, Macia failed to show that he was prejudiced. The District Court also\n\nheld that Macia failed to present any evidence supporting his claim that his waiver of his\n\nright to representation was based on the false promise of non-prosecution. The District\n\nCourt ruled that the BOP did not violate due process in denying Macia representation in\n\nany event because Wolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), provides a right to staff\n\nrepresentation at a prison disciplinary hearing only when the inmate is illiterate or the\n\nissue to be adjudicated is complex. The District Court decided that Macia’s case did not\n\nmeet the Wolff criteria. The District Court held that there was more than some evidence\n\nto support the disciplinary hearing officer’s finding of guilt based on the undisputed fact\n\nthat Macia left the institution (FPC-Pensacola) on June 9, 2004. In addition, the District\n\nCourt determined that the sanctions imposed were not excessive because they fell well\n\nwithin the BOP Guidelines for high level offenses set forth at 28 C.F.R. § 541.13, tables 3\n\nand 4. The District Court also held that Macia’s claim challenging his current\n\ninstitutional placement and custody classification was not properly brought in a habeas\n\ncorpus petition because it related to the conditions of prison confinement, rather than the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        The District Court also denied Macia’s motion for appointment of counsel and\ndismissed his summary judgment motion .\n\n                                              3\n\ffact or duration of his sentence. Macia timely appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction to review the dismissal of Macia’s petition pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s legal\n\nconclusions as no evidentiary hearing was conducted by the District Court. See Ruggiano\n\nv.

We conclude that Macia’s challenges to the disciplinary hearing and the sanctions\n\nimposed, including his disciplinary transfer, affect the manner in which his sentence is\n\nexecuted and are properly brought under § 2241. Upon careful review of the arguments\n\non appeal, we will affirm.\n\n       Macia claims that the BOP violated his Constitutional rights and BOP policy by\n\nfailing to suspend the disciplinary action pending possible criminal prosecution. The\n\ncommencement of prison disciplinary proceedings before the criminal prosecution for\n\nescape did not violate Macia’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Even\n\nrights “basic to a fair hearing” are “necessarily circumscribed by the penological need to\n\nprovide swift discipline in individual cases.” Ponte v.

Corr. Inst.,\n\nWalpole v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (1985) (citing Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67).\n\n       Turning to Macia’s claim that the disciplinary hearing officer failed to advise him\n\nof his rights on the day of the hearing, the District Court correctly held that the prison and\n\ndisciplinary hearing officer afforded Macia the procedural protections he was due under\n\nWolff. See 418 U.S. at 555-57. The record indicates that Macia received written notice\n\nof the charges against him and was advised of his disciplinary hearing rights in\n\naccordance with Wolff before his hearing. Because Macia had already been advised of\n\nhis hearing rights, the hearing officer was not obligated under Wolff to reiterate those\n\nrights at the hearing.\n\n       As for Macia’s challenge to re-classification and disciplinary transfer, we agree\n\nwith the District Court that these sanctions are well within the BOP guidelines for\n\npunishment. Thus, they do not amount to a constitutional violation.\n\n       We turn to Macia’s last claim, that his admission of guilt at the disciplinary\n\nhearing was not knowing and voluntary because the disciplinary hearing officer induced\n\nhim to waive his rights to staff representation and to a full hearing on a false promise of\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fnon-prosecution. Inmates do not have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in\n\nprison disciplinary hearings. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 570. Although BOP regulations provide\n\nfor staff assistance in certain cases, the lack of such representation in Macia’s case does\n\nnot constitute a due process violation. In any event, as the District Court correctly noted,\n\nthe BOP regulations were not violated because Macia was not illiterate and the issues in\n\nhis case were not complex.\n\n       As for Macia’s contention that the disciplinary hearing officer wrongfully induced\n\nhim to waive his right to a hearing, the District Court held that Macia failed to produce\n\nany evidence to support his claim that the disciplinary hearing officer promised him non-\n\nprosecution in exchange for a guilty plea on the disciplinary charge. Our review of the\n\nrecord, however, reveals what appears to be admissible evidence in support of Macia’s\n\nallegation. Macia submitted an affidavit stating under penalty of perjury that “the\n\nstatement of facts of the case in the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is true and\n\ncorrect.” In his § 2241 petition, Macia states that the disciplinary hearing officer took\n\ninto consideration that Macia “was likely to face criminal prosecution after leaving the\n\n[prison] camp to visit my grieving family after my brother’s suicide” and that Macia had\n\nbeen offered a hardship furlough, as well as Macia’s past record, “to weigh whether I was\n\nto be criminally prosecuted. I was told to waive my rights, not to call witnesses or to\n\ndemand representation to be assured of no criminal charges for a plea of guilty that day.”\n\nSee § 2241 Petition at ¶ 9-A. Macia’s own statement, even if uncorroborated, raises a\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fquestion of fact as to whether he voluntarily waived the right to call witnesses and present\n\ndocumentary evidence in his defense. Normally, an evidentiary hearing would resolve the\n\nfactual issue. No evidentiary hearing is necessary in Macia’s case, however. Even\n\nassuming that Macia’s waiver was wrongfully induced, we conclude that the error was\n\nharmless.3 Putting Macia’s admission aside, there is substantial evidence of his guilt as to\n\nthe prison misconduct charge. Specific evidence relied on by the disciplinary hearing\n\nofficer in finding Macia guilty of the misconduct charge included the report of Officer\n\nMichael that the 10:00 p.m. bed count on June 9, 2004, revealed that Macia was absent\n\nfrom his bunk. See Appellant’s Brief, Exh. 4, § V. Lieutenant Lawson reported that the\n\nbed counts in the rest of the prison that night were normal. Id. A search of the prison\n\ncompound and immediate surrounding area failed to locate Macia. Id. Officers inspected\n\nMacia’s personal locker and bunker areas and found that all of his personal items were\n\ngone. Id. The U.S. Marshal was notified. Id. It is undisputed that Macia was\n\napprehended the next day in Florida, at a location outside of the prison facility.\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         We note at the outset of our harmless error analysis that Macia did not provide to\nthe prison hearing officer, the District Court, or this Court on appeal, the names of the\nwitnesses he would have called or the documentation he would have presented had he not\nwaived his hearing rights.\n                                       8\n\f</pre>",
