The District Court\n\ngranted summary judgment to all defendants and denied Tapp‟s cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment, and Tapp appealed.1 We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291\n\nand review the order granting summary judgment under a plenary standard of review.\n\nState Auto Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Pro Design, P.C., 566 F.3d 86, 89 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\nBecause this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the\n\nDistrict Court‟s judgment. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\nI.        Free Exercise of Religion\n\n          Tapp first claims that the defendants violated his First Amendment right to the free\n\nexercise of religion by failing to provide him with acceptable Kosher meals. The\n\nundisputed evidence reveals, however, that the prison began to serve Kosher meals to\n\nTapp less than two weeks after he first requested them. Given that a prison is entitled to\n\nassess whether an inmate‟s dietary requirements are motivated by “sincerely held”\n\nreligious beliefs, DeHart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47, 51 (3d Cir. 2000), we conclude that the\n\nprison‟s short delay in honoring Tapp‟s request did not impinge on his free exercise\n\nrights.\n\n          Tapp also complains that the Kosher meals the prison served him lacked variety\n\nand were often cold. We have previously held that a prison does not violate the Free\n\n\n          1\n           Tapp named 29 defendants in his complaint. In the interest of brevity and\n          because we conclude that his claims fail against all defendants, we will treat the\n\n                                                2\n\fExercise Clause by offering an all-cold Kosher diet, see Johnson v. Horn, 150 F.3d 276,\n\n283 (3d Cir. 1998), overruled on other grounds by DeHart, 227 F.3d at 55, and similarly\n\nperceive no constitutional violation here. Moreover, to the extent that Tapp alleges the\n\nexistence of other intermittent problems with food preparation, those issues impose only\n\na de minimis burden on his religion and thus do not violate the Free Exercise Clause. See\n\nRapier v. Harris, 172 F.3d 999, 1006 n.4 (7th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, we agree with the\n\nDistrict Court that Tapp‟s free-exercise claims lack merit.\n\nII.    Right of Access to the Courts\n\n       Tapp next argues that prison officials denied his right of access to the courts by\n\nrefusing to notarize his documents or allow him to use the law library. To prevail on\n\nsuch a claim, Tapp must show that the denial of access caused actual injury; for instance,\n\nthat he was prevented from asserting a “nonfrivolous” and “arguable” claim. Christopher\n\nv. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415 (2002). As the District Court explained, Tapp failed on\n\nsummary judgment to show any such injury. While Tapp claimed at his deposition that\n\ndue to the prison officials‟ obstruction he was unable to institute a habeas action in the\n\nSouthern District of New York, that court‟s docket reveals that Tapp filed a habeas\n\npetition before he entered Lancaster County Prison. Moreover, contrary to the broad\n\nallegations in Tapp‟s complaint, the documentary evidence shows that Tapp was in fact\n\nprovided with notary services and permitted to use the library on a regular basis\n\nthroughout his incarceration — and that he prosecuted at least three civil cases during this\n\nperiod. See Wilson v. Prasse, 404 F.2d 1380, 1381 (3d Cir. 1968) (“[T]he many civil\n\n\n       defendants collectively throughout this opinion.\n                                              3\n\factions instituted by appellant in the federal and state courts supported the conclusion of\n\nthe District Court that the contention that appellant had been denied access to the court\n\nwas frivolous.”).\n\n       Nor did the alleged flaws in the prison‟s grievance system violate Tapp‟s right of\n\naccess to the courts. The District Court correctly noted both that an inmate has no\n\nconstitutional right to a grievance procedure and that the existence of the instant case\n\nbelies any notion that Tapp could not access the courts. See Antonelli v. Sheahan, 81\n\nF.3d 1422, 1430 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\nIII.   Conditions of Confinement\n\n       Tapp presents an array of claims concerning the conditions of his confinement.\n\nTwo different legal standards are applicable: Tapp‟s claims that arose while he was a\n\npretrial detainee (from when he entered the prison until he was sentenced on September\n\n17, 2007) must be prosecuted under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, while his claims that arose after he was sentenced are analyzed under the\n\nEighth Amendment‟s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. See Hubbard v. Taylor,\n\n399 F.3d 150, 164 (3d Cir. 2005). In lieu of attempting to glean from Tapp‟s unclear\n\nallegations precisely which period of his confinement his claims concern, we will analyze\n\nall of his claims under the Due Process Clause, because his due process rights are at least\n\nas broad, if not broader, than his rights under the Eighth Amendment. See Fuentes v.\n\nWagner, 206 F.3d 335, 344 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       Tapp first argues that his rights were violated when he was forced to share a cell\n\nwith two other inmates. The Supreme Court has recognized that “confining a given\n\n                                             4\n\fnumber of people in a given amount of space in such a manner as to cause them to endure\n\ngenuine privations and hardship over an extended period of time might raise serious\n\nquestions under the Due Process Clause.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 542 (1979).\n\nHere, Tapp‟s cell was 95 square feet in size and, according to the deputy warden at\n\nLancaster, was actually designed to house three people. Moreover, Tapp was held in this\n\ncell for only four to six weeks, and during this time he was provided with an elevated\n\n“boat bunk” with a mattress. These conditions do not amount to the type of hardship that\n\nviolates the Due Process Clause. See Hubbard v. Taylor, 538 F.3d 229, 236 (3d Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n         Tapp also argues that his rights were violated because two days each week he was\n\ndenied access to the exercise and shower facilities. Other courts have held that similar\n\nconditions do not violate the Eighth Amendment, see, e.g., Spain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d\n\n189, 199 (9th Cir. 1979) (exercise); Davenport v. DeRobertis, 844 F.2d 1310, 1316 (7th\n\nCir. 1988) (shower), and given that Tapp has presented no evidence that this schedule\n\nsomehow amounts to punishment, we conclude that his claim likewise fails under the\n\nDue Process Clause.\n\n         We reach the same conclusion as to Tapp‟s complaints that he was given clothes\n\nthat had previously been worn by other inmates, that the prison temperatures were too\n\nhigh, and that he was forced to room for a night with an unruly “dope fiend.” While\n\nprison officials must ensure that prisoners receive adequate clothes, are held in cells that\n\nare sufficiently ventilated, and are protected from being harmed by other prisoners, see\n\ngenerally Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994); Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083,\n\n                                              5\n\f1091 (9th Cir. 1996), we conclude that Tapp has presented no evidence that the\n\nconditions he experienced amounted to the type of genuine privation that qualifies as\n\n“punishment.” See Bell, 441 U.S. at 537 (“the fact that such detention interferes with a\n\ndetainee‟s understandable desire to live as comfortably as possible . . . does not convert\n\nthe conditions or restrictions of detention into „punishment‟”).\n\n       Finally, Tapp contends that he received inadequate medical care because the\n\nprison‟s medical staff failed properly to document his weight. Contrary to Tapp‟s\n\nargument, the evidence shows that upon learning that Tapp had lost weight, the staff\n\nweighed him repeatedly, took blood tests, and arranged for him to receive a nightly\n\nsnack. Ultimately, the medical records report, his weight was stabilized. Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that the District Court was correct to grant summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants on this claim.2\n\nIV.    Remaining Claims\n\n       Tapp‟s remaining claims will be addressed here seriatim. Tapp complains that\n\nprison officials wrongfully appropriated a photograph of his girlfriend. However,\n\ndeprivation of inmate property by prison officials does not state a cognizable due process\n\nclaim if the prisoner has an adequate post-deprivation state remedy. Hudson v. Palmer,\n\n468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984). Adequate remedies were available here: Tapp could have\n\n\n       2\n         Tapp also claims that he was given an inadequate diet and that the drinking water\n       he received came from a tank that mixed drinking and sewage water. However, he\n       has presented no evidence in support of these claims beyond his mere speculation,\n       while the prison officials have presented documentary evidence that contradicts\n       these claims. Accordingly, the District Court properly granted summary judgment\n       to the prison officials.\n\n                                             6\n\ffiled a state tort action, see id. at 535, or used the prison‟s grievance process, see Tillman\n\nv. Lebanon County Corr., 221 F.3d 410, 422 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       Tapp contends that he was the victim of numerous, multi-faceted conspiracies.\n\nThese claims must fail because all that Tapp has presented are “ambiguous allegations\n\nand vague inferences,” which, this Court has explained, “cannot defeat summary\n\njudgment.” Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E. ex rel M.E., 172 F.3d 238, 254 (3d Cir.\n\n1999). Tapp‟s allegations of racial discrimination similarly lack merit because they are\n\nbased on only his unsupported conclusion that the defendants acted against him on the\n\nbasis of his race. See Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of Educ., 587 F.3d 176, 197\n\n(3d Cir. 2009).\n\n       Finally, Tapp avers that prison officials violated his due process rights because\n\nthey held a disciplinary hearing in which he was not permitted to call witnesses or\n\nproduce documentary evidence. See Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 17 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(discussing rights of pretrial detainees). However, by Tapp‟s own testimony, he\n\nintentionally violated prison rules for the very purpose of being placed in segregation so\n\nthat he would no longer have to room with his then-cellmate. In these unusual\n\ncircumstances, it is unclear what documentary evidence he would have introduced — he\n\nhas not identified any — and it was permissible for the officials to determine that\n\nwitnesses were unnecessary. See Pannell v. McBride, 306 F.3d 499, 503 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\nFor these same reasons, we perceive no way in which these restrictions could have\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fresulted in prejudice. See Piggie v. Cotton, 344 F.3d 674, 678 (7th Cir. 2003).3\n\n       We have thoroughly reviewed the remaining allegations Tapp has made and find\n\nthem meritless. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no substantial question presented\n\nby this appeal, and will thus summarily affirm the District Court‟s orders granting\n\nsummary judgment to all defendants and denying summary judgment to Tapp. See 3d\n\nCir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we conclude that the District Court also\n       correctly denied Tapp‟s cross-motion for summary judgment and his request for\n       injunctive relief. We likewise affirm the District Court‟s order denying Tapp‟s\n       motion for reconsideration. While Tapp argued that he was deprived of his legal\n       papers, the documentary evidence and Tapp‟s own statements in his filings and\n       deposition refute this contention.\n\n                                             8\n\f",

Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763054\"><a href=\"/opinion/763054/ricky-j-rapier-v-sheriff-william-harris-jail-commander-jon-marvel/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1006 n.4 (7th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, we agree with the\n\nDistrict Court that Tapp‟s free-exercise claims lack merit.\n\nII.    Right of Access to the Courts\n\n       Tapp next argues that prison officials denied his right of access to the courts by\n\nrefusing to notarize his documents or allow him to use the law library. To prevail on\n\nsuch a claim, Tapp must show that the denial of access caused actual injury; for instance,\n\nthat he was prevented from asserting a “nonfrivolous” and “arguable” claim. Christopher\n\nv. Harbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (2002). As the District Court explained, Tapp failed on\n\nsummary judgment to show any such injury. While Tapp claimed at his deposition that\n\ndue to the prison officials‟ obstruction he was unable to institute a habeas action in the\n\nSouthern District of New York, that court‟s docket reveals that Tapp filed a habeas\n\npetition before he entered Lancaster County Prison. Moreover, contrary to the broad\n\nallegations in Tapp‟s complaint, the documentary evidence shows that Tapp was in fact\n\nprovided with notary services and permitted to use the library on a regular basis\n\nthroughout his incarceration — and that he prosecuted at least three civil cases during this\n\nperiod. See Wilson v. Prasse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"282829\"><a href=\"/opinion/282829/perley-wilson-v-arthur-t-prasse-commissioner-of-correction-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1381 (3d Cir. 1968) (“[T]he many civil\n\n\n       defendants collectively throughout this opinion.\n                                              3\n\factions instituted by appellant in the federal and state courts supported the conclusion of\n\nthe District Court that the contention that appellant had been denied access to the court\n\nwas frivolous.”).\n\n       Nor did the alleged flaws in the prison‟s grievance system violate Tapp‟s right of\n\naccess to the courts. The District Court correctly noted both that an inmate has no\n\nconstitutional right to a grievance procedure and that the existence of the instant case\n\nbelies any notion that Tapp could not access the courts. See Antonelli v. Sheahan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716744\"><a href=\"/opinion/716744/michael-c-antonelli-v-michael-f-sheahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1422</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1430 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\nIII.   Conditions of Confinement\n\n       Tapp presents an array of claims concerning the conditions of his confinement.\n\nTwo different legal standards are applicable: Tapp‟s claims that arose while he was a\n\npretrial detainee (from when he entered the prison until he was sentenced on September\n\n17, 2007) must be prosecuted under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, while his claims that arose after he was sentenced are analyzed under the\n\nEighth Amendment‟s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. See Hubbard v. Taylor,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789359\"><a href=\"/opinion/789359/gregory-hubbard-alvin-phillips-julian-payne-curtis-gibbs-gregory-j-bolling/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164 (3d Cir. 2005). In lieu of attempting to glean from Tapp‟s unclear\n\nallegations precisely which period of his confinement his claims concern, we will analyze\n\nall of his claims under the Due Process Clause, because his due process rights are at least\n\nas broad, if not broader, than his rights under the Eighth Amendment. See Fuentes v.\n\nWagner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767972\"><a href=\"/opinion/767972/luis-fuentes-v-wagner-warden-konemann-correctional-officer-kleeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 344 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       Tapp first argues that his rights were violated when he was forced to share a cell\n\nwith two other inmates. The Supreme Court has recognized that “confining a given\n\n                                             4\n\fnumber of people in a given amount of space in such a manner as to cause them to endure\n\ngenuine privations and hardship over an extended period of time might raise serious\n\nquestions under the Due Process Clause.” Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542 (1979).\n\nHere, Tapp‟s cell was 95 square feet in size and, according to the deputy warden at\n\nLancaster, was actually designed to house three people. Moreover, Tapp was held in this\n\ncell for only four to six weeks, and during this time he was provided with an elevated\n\n“boat bunk” with a mattress. These conditions do not amount to the type of hardship that\n\nviolates the Due Process Clause. See Hubbard v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1442483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1442483/hubbard-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (3d Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n         Tapp also argues that his rights were violated because two days each week he was\n\ndenied access to the exercise and shower facilities. Other courts have held that similar\n\nconditions do not violate the Eighth Amendment, see, e.g., Spain v. Procunier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367000\"><a href=\"/opinion/367000/johnny-l-spain-v-raymond-k-procunier/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (9th Cir. 1979) (exercise); Davenport v. DeRobertis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504678\"><a href=\"/opinion/504678/james-davenport-v-richard-derobertis-michael-oleary-and-michael-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1316 (7th\n\nCir. 1988) (shower), and given that Tapp has presented no evidence that this schedule\n\nsomehow amounts to punishment, we conclude that his claim likewise fails under the\n\nDue Process Clause.\n\n         We reach the same conclusion as to Tapp‟s complaints that he was given clothes\n\nthat had previously been worn by other inmates, that the prison temperatures were too\n\nhigh, and that he was forced to room for a night with an unruly “dope fiend.” While\n\nprison officials must ensure that prisoners receive adequate clothes, are held in cells that\n\nare sufficiently ventilated, and are protected from being harmed by other prisoners, see\n\ngenerally Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (1994); Keenan v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718273\"><a href=\"/opinion/718273/96-cal-daily-op-serv-3261-96-daily-journal-dar-5331-charles-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n                                              5\n\f1091 (9th Cir. 1996), we conclude that Tapp has presented no evidence that the\n\nconditions he experienced amounted to the type of genuine privation that qualifies as\n\n“punishment.” See Bell, 441 U.S. at 537 (“the fact that such detention interferes with a\n\ndetainee‟s understandable desire to live as comfortably as possible . . . does not convert\n\nthe conditions or restrictions of detention into „punishment‟”).\n\n       Finally, Tapp contends that he received inadequate medical care because the\n\nprison‟s medical staff failed properly to document his weight. Contrary to Tapp‟s\n\nargument, the evidence shows that upon learning that Tapp had lost weight, the staff\n\nweighed him repeatedly, took blood tests, and arranged for him to receive a nightly\n\nsnack. Ultimately, the medical records report, his weight was stabilized. Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that the District Court was correct to grant summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants on this claim.2\n\nIV.    Remaining Claims\n\n       Tapp‟s remaining claims will be addressed here seriatim. Tapp complains that\n\nprison officials wrongfully appropriated a photograph of his girlfriend. However,\n\ndeprivation of inmate property by prison officials does not state a cognizable due process\n\nclaim if the prisoner has an adequate post-deprivation state remedy. Hudson v. Palmer,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (1984). Adequate remedies were available here: Tapp could have\n\n\n       2\n         Tapp also claims that he was given an inadequate diet and that the drinking water\n       he received came from a tank that mixed drinking and sewage water. However, he\n       has presented no evidence in support of these claims beyond his mere speculation,\n       while the prison officials have presented documentary evidence that contradicts\n       these claims. Accordingly, the District Court properly granted summary judgment\n       to the prison officials.\n\n                                             6\n\ffiled a state tort action, see id. at 535, or used the prison‟s grievance process, see Tillman\n\nv. Lebanon County Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769755\"><a href=\"/opinion/769755/leonard-g-tillman-v-lebanon-county-correctional-facility-robert-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       Tapp contends that he was the victim of numerous, multi-faceted conspiracies.\n\nThese claims must fail because all that Tapp has presented are “ambiguous allegations\n\nand vague inferences,” which, this Court has explained, “cannot defeat summary\n\njudgment.” Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E. ex rel M.E., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762759\"><a href=\"/opinion/762759/ridgewood-board-of-education-v-ne-as-guardian-ad-litem-for-me-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (3d Cir.\n\n1999). Tapp‟s allegations of racial discrimination similarly lack merit because they are\n\nbased on only his unsupported conclusion that the defendants acted against him on the\n\nbasis of his race. See Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345549\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345549/chambers-v-school-dist-philadelphia-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197\n\n(3d Cir. 2009).\n\n       Finally, Tapp avers that prison officials violated his due process rights because\n\nthey held a disciplinary hearing in which he was not permitted to call witnesses or\n\nproduce documentary evidence. See Surprenant v. Rivas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201815\"><a href=\"/opinion/201815/surprenant-v-rivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(discussing rights of pretrial detainees). However, by Tapp‟s own testimony, he\n\nintentionally violated prison rules for the very purpose of being placed in segregation so\n\nthat he would no longer have to room with his then-cellmate. In these unusual\n\ncircumstances, it is unclear what documentary evidence he would have introduced — he\n\nhas not identified any — and it was permissible for the officials to determine that\n\nwitnesses were unnecessary. See Pannell v. McBride, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779381\"><a href=\"/opinion/779381/david-pannell-v-daniel-r-mcbride-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\nFor these same reasons, we perceive no way in which these restrictions could have\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fresulted in prejudice. See Piggie v. Cotton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783644\"><a href=\"/opinion/783644/clyde-piggie-v-zettie-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (7th Cir. 2003).3\n\n       We have thoroughly reviewed the remaining allegations Tapp has made and find\n\nthem meritless. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no substantial question presented\n\nby this appeal, and will thus summarily affirm the District Court‟s orders granting\n\nsummary judgment to all defendants and denying summary judgment to Tapp. See 3d\n\nCir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we conclude that the District Court also\n       correctly denied Tapp‟s cross-motion for summary judgment and his request for\n       injunctive relief. We likewise affirm the District Court‟s order denying Tapp‟s\n       motion for reconsideration. While Tapp argued that he was deprived of his legal\n       papers, the documentary evidence and Tapp‟s own statements in his filings and\n       deposition refute this contention.\n\n                                             8\n\f</pre>",
