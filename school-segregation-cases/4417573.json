Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983). She contends the\ndistrict court incorrectly found that the government had not\nacted in bad faith under EAJA section 2412(b) and therefore\nerred by declining to award market-rate fees. She further\nargues the district court erred by finding that the\ngovernment’s conduct was substantially justified under\nEAJA section 2412(d)(1)(A) on discrete issues and at\ndiscrete stages of the litigation, rather than making a single\ndetermination on the case as a whole. Finally, she challenges\nthe district court’s striking of her objections to a special\nmaster’s report on her claimed expenses. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n    In light of the Supreme Court’s decision in\nCommissioner, INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154 (1990), we hold\nthe district court erred by making multiple substantial\njustification determinations and accordingly reverse. We\nalso reverse the district court’s various reductions imposed\non Ibrahim’s eligible fees arising from its incorrect\nsubstantial justification analysis.\n\n   We however affirm the district court’s bad faith findings\nas well as its relatedness findings under Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983). We also affirm the district\ncourt’s striking of Ibrahim’s objections to the special\nmaster’s report on expenses.\n\f6                       IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n                                    I.\n\n    Fee disputes, the Supreme Court has warned, “should not\nresult in a second major litigation.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437.\nBut, unsurprisingly, they sometimes do, and the instant case\nis one such example.\n\n     In January 2006, Ibrahim commenced this action seeking\nmonetary and equitable relief against various state and\nfederal officials alleging 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims, state law\ntort claims, and constitutional claims based on her inclusion\nin the government’s terrorist databases, including the No-Fly\nList. After two dismissals and subsequent reversals and\nremands by this Court, Ibrahim v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec.,\n538 F.3d 1250 (9th Cir. 2008) (“Ibrahim I”), Ibrahim v.\nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 669 F.3d 983 (9th Cir. 2012)\n(“Ibrahim II”), the district court held a week-long bench\ntrial. 1\n\n    The district court concluded that Ibrahim had been\nimproperly placed within the government’s databases. 2\nSpecifically, it found the FBI agent who nominated Ibrahim\nto the government watchlists incorrectly filled out the\nnomination form. As a result, Ibrahim was placed on the No-\nFly List and another terrorist screening watchlist, rather than\nthe lists on which the FBI agent had intended she be placed.\nId. Accordingly, the court below ruled in favor of Ibrahim\n\n    1\n    At the time of trial, the only remaining claims were those against the\nfederal defendants arising from their placement of Ibrahim on the\ngovernment’s terrorism watchlists, as well as their revocation and\nsubsequent denial of Ibrahim’s entry visas.\n\n  2\n     The district court’s factual findings are not challenged on appeal;\nunless otherwise noted, factual assertions contained herein reflect those\nfindings.\n\f                    IBRAHIM V. USDHS                        7\n\non her procedural due process claim, concluding the\ngovernment’s nomination error involved a “conceded,\nproven, undeniable, and serious error by the government.”\nAlthough Ibrahim had been removed from the No-Fly List\nin early 2005, the government was ordered to remove any\ninformation contained in its databases associated with the\n2004 nomination form, including those databases the FBI\nagent had intended Ibrahim be placed on, because the\nnomination form had been incorrectly filled out. It also\nordered the government to affirmatively inform Ibrahim she\nwas no longer on the No-Fly List because the government’s\nTravel Redress Inquiry Plan—the only means by which an\nindividual may challenge their suspected placement on the\nNo-Fly List—failed to affirmatively disclose whether she\nhad indeed been placed on the list incorrectly and whether\nshe had been removed as a result.\n\n    The district court also granted unasked-for relief under\nour now-vacated precedent in Din v. Kerry, 718 F.3d 856,\n863 (9th Cir. 2013), vacated, 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015) by\nordering the government to identify the specific subsection\nunder section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and\nNationality Act that rendered Ibrahim ineligible for a visa in\n2009 and 2013. Lastly, on additional independent grounds,\nthe district court granted further relief by finding that the\nconsular officer who denied Ibrahim her visa erred in\nindicating she could not apply for a discretionary waiver of\nher ineligibility. The district court ordered the government\nto permit such a waiver application.\n\n    The district court did not reach the remainder of\nIbrahim’s other claims which included her First\nAmendment, substantive due process, equal protection, and\nAdministrative Procedure Act claims because, in its view,\n\f8                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n“even if successful, [they] would not lead to any greater\nrelief than already ordered.”\n\n    Thereafter, the parties and the court engaged in a lengthy\nand contentious fee dispute. In total, Ibrahim sought\n$3,630,057.50 in market-rate attorney’s fees and\n$293,860.18 in expenses. Adopting the recommendations of\na special master, the district court ultimately awarded\nIbrahim $419,987.36 in fees and $34,768.71 in costs and\nexpenses. Ibrahim challenges both the underlying legal\nframework the district court utilized to determine the fees\nshe was eligible to recover, as well as the district court’s\nadoption of various reductions applied to those eligible fees\nby the special master.\n\n                                 II.\n\n  We begin with the district court’s application of the\nEAJA.\n\n    Congress passed the EAJA “to eliminate for the average\nperson the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable\ngovernmental actions.” Jean, 496 U.S. at 163. To that end,\nthe EAJA permits a “prevailing party” to recover fees and\nother expenses from the government unless the government\ndemonstrates that its position was “substantially justified.”3\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A); Thangaraja v. Gonzales,\n428 F.3d 870, 874 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Gonzales v. Free\nSpeech Coal., 408 F.3d 613, 618 (9th Cir. 2005)). The EAJA\nlimits attorney’s fees to “the prevailing market rates for the\nkind and quality of the services furnished” but, subject to\n\n  3\n     The EAJA also provides for an exception where “special\ncircumstances” would make a fee award to the prevailing party unjust.\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).\n\f                    IBRAHIM V. USDHS                         9\n\nexception, does not permit an award in excess of $125 per\nhour. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(A). One such exception to that\ncap applies where the court finds the government acted in\nbad faith. Rodriguez v. United States, 542 F.3d 704, 709 (9th\nCir. 2008).\n\n    After determining Ibrahim was a prevailing party, the\ncourt below found that the government was substantially\njustified respecting its pre-Ibrahim II standing arguments, its\ndefense against Ibrahim’s visa-related claims, and its various\nprivilege assertions. It disallowed fees associated with those\nissues. It found the government’s conduct otherwise was not\njustified.\n\n    It further ruled that the government had not acted in bad\nfaith, and with one exception not relevant here, imposed the\nEAJA’s hourly cap to Ibrahim’s fees.\n\n   Ibrahim contends these findings were erroneous. We\naddress each in turn.\n\n                              A.\n\n    We review a district court’s substantial justification\ndetermination for abuse of discretion. Gonzales, 408 F.3d at\n618. We review its interpretation of the EAJA de novo.\nEdwards v. McMahon, 834 F.2d 796, 801 (9th Cir. 1987).\n\n    The government’s “position” when considered within\nthe EAJA context includes both the government’s litigation\nposition as well as the “action or failure to act by the agency\nupon which the civil action is based.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2412(d)(1)(B). Hence, we have often articulated the\nsubstantial justification test as encompassing two lines of\ninquiry: one directed towards the government’s original\naction, and the other towards the government’s litigation\n\f10                       IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nposition defending that action. See, e.g., Gutierrez v.\nBarnhart, 274 F.3d 1255, 1259 (9th Cir. 2001). But it\nremains true that the test is an inclusive one; it is the\ngovernment’s position “as a whole” that must have “a\nreasonable basis in fact and law.” Id. at 1261. 4\n\n    Citing our decisions in Shafer v. Astrue, 518 F.3d 1067,\n1071 (9th Cir. 2008), and Li v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 913, 918\n(9th Cir. 2007), the court below concluded “[t]he\ngovernment must show that its position was substantially\njustified at each stage of the proceedings in order to avoid an\naward of EAJA fees.” It went on to invoke our decision in\nCorbin v. Apfel, 149 F.3d 1051, 1053 (9th Cir. 1998), for the\nproposition that in exceedingly complex cases, a court may\nappropriately determine whether the government was\nsubstantially justified at each “stage” of the litigation and\nmake a fee award apportioned to those separate\ndeterminations. It accordingly disallowed fees for discrete\npositions 5 taken by the government because, in its view, the\ngovernment’s positions in each instance were substantially\njustified. It was error to do so.\n\n   In Jean, 496 U.S. at 161–62, the Supreme Court broadly\npronounced that the EAJA “favors treating a case as an\n  4\n      And though we have held generally that “a reasonable litigation\nposition does not establish substantial justification in the face of a clearly\nunjustified underlying action,” we have declined to adopt a per se rule\nforeclosing that possibility. United States v. Marolf, 277 F.3d 1156,\n1163–64 and n.5 (9th Cir. 2002). We have likewise left open the\npossibility that reasonable underlying conduct may not be sufficient\ngrounds to preclude a fee award in the face of otherwise unreasonable\nlitigation tactics. Id.\n\n  5\n    As noted, these include the government’s pre-Ibrahim II standing\nassertions, the government’s defense of its revocation of Ibrahim’s visa,\nas well as the government’s privilege assertions.\n\f                    IBRAHIM V. USDHS                      11\n\ninclusive whole, rather than as atomized line-items.” Noting\nsection 2412(d)(2)(D)’s use of the term “position” in the\nsingular coupled with Congress’s “emphasis on the\nunderlying Government action,” the Court concluded the\nEAJA substantial justification determination acted as a “one-\ntime threshold for fee eligibility.” Id. at 159–60 and n.7.\nAccordingly, the Jean Court rejected petitioners’ argument\nthat the court was required to make two substantial\njustification determinations: one as to respondents’ fees for\ntime and expenses incurred in applying for fees, and another\nas to fees in the litigation itself. Id. at 157.\n\n    Jean, then, we think is clear: courts are to make but one\nsubstantial justification determination on the case as a\nwhole. That is not to say a court may not consider the\ngovernment’s success at various stages of the litigation when\nmaking that inquiry, but those separate points of focus must\nbe made as individual inquiries collectively shedding light\non the government’s conduct on the whole, rather than as\ndistinct stages considered in isolation. Indeed in United\nStates v. Rubin, 97 F.3d 373, 375–76 (9th Cir. 1996), we\naffirmed a district court’s treating the case as a whole in\ndisallowing fees although there was some indication at least\npart of the government’s conduct was not substantially\njustified. In doing so, we cited favorably to Jean’s\nrecognition that the EAJA favors treating the case as an\n“inclusive whole.” Id. at 375 (quoting Jean, 496 U.S. at 161–\n62).\n\n    We are aware our sister courts have adopted contrary\nviews in this regard. The D.C. Circuit, for instance, has\nrejected a reading of Jean that would preclude a claim-by-\nclaim determination on the ground that such a rule would\nrender the EAJA a “virtual nullity” because government\nconduct is nearly always grouped with or part of some\n\f12                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\ngreater, and presumably justified, action. Air Trans. Ass’n v.\nF.A.A., 156 F.3d 1329, 1332 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In the same\nvein, the Seventh Circuit has cautioned against taking\n“judicial language out of context,” reasoning that Jean “does\nnot address the question whether allocation is permissible\nunder the [EAJA]” to allow fees for the part of the\ngovernment’s case that was not substantially justified.\nGatimi v. Holder, 606 F.3d 344, 350 (7th Cir. 2010). 6\n\n    We do not share the fear, however, that a single-inquiry\nrule will render the EAJA “a virtual nullity.” Air Trans.\nAss’n, 156 F.3d at 1332. The possibility that an evaluation\nof the government’s conduct can be so “‘holistic,’” id., so as\nto preclude a finding that the government was ever without\nsubstantial justification surely exists,7 but such an\napplication would run afoul of the basic principle that courts\ninterpret and apply statutes “in light of the overall purpose\nand structure of the whole statutory scheme.” United States\nv. Neal, 776 F.3d 645, 652 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\n    Nor are we concerned that a single-inquiry rule would\ndisallow the recovery of fees even where the government\nmay have been unjustified at certain stages or in discrete\npositions it took throughout the lifetime of the case. As the\n 6\n    Some circuits, like the Third Circuit, have required district courts to\n“evaluate every significant argument made by an agency” in order to\npermit an appellate court “to review a district court’s decision and\ndetermine whether, as a whole, the Government’s position was\nsubstantially justified.” Hanover Potato Prods., Inc. v. Shalala, 989 F.2d\n123, 131 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n 7\n    Because, on a general level, almost all government action is carried\nout through authorized avenues pursuant to some legitimate purpose.\nAnalyzed at that bird’s-eye level, it is true that almost all government\naction is “usually substantially justified.” Air Trans. Ass’n, 156 F.3d at\n1332.\n\f                     IBRAHIM V. USDHS                        13\n\nSupreme Court has noted, “substantially justified” in this\ncontext only requires justification “to a degree that could\nsatisfy a reasonable person.” Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S.\n552, 565 (1988). That formulation implicitly permits the\ngovernment some leeway, so long as its conduct on the\nwhole remained justified. Whether those portions of the case\non which the government was not substantially justified are\nsufficient to warrant fee shifting on the case as a whole is a\nquestion left to the evaluating court’s discretion. But that a\nsituation may arise where a court may deny a prevailing\nparty fees even though the government was not substantially\njustified as to every position it took does not trouble us. Such\na result seems expressly contemplated by the EAJA’s use of\nthe qualifying term “substantial” rather than “total” or\n“complete.” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).\n\n    What’s more, “[a]voiding an interpretation that ensures\nthat the fee application will spawn a second litigation of\nsignificant dimension is central to Supreme Court\njurisprudence on fee-shifting statutes.” Hardisty v. Astrue,\n592 F.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal punctuation\nomitted) (quoting Tex. State Teachers Ass’n v. Garland\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791 (1989)). An approach\npermissive of separate substantial justification inquiries runs\nafoul of that interpretive paradigm.\n\n     Nor do we see any conflict with our decisions in Corbin,\n149 F.3d at 1053, or its progeny in which we have upheld\nEAJA fee awards in the social security context where the\naward was apportioned to each successive stage of the\nlitigation. As we noted in Corbin, following the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292\n\f14                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n(1993), 8 “it became possible for a [social security] claimant\nto be deemed a ‘prevailing party’ for EAJA purposes prior\nto the ultimate disposition of his disability claim.” Corbin,\n149 F.3d at 1053. As a result, we shifted focus from\n“considering only [whether the government was\nsubstantially justified as to] the ultimate issue of disability to\nconsidering the justification of the government’s position at\nthe discrete stage in question.” Id. We have never applied\nCorbin outside of the social security context, nor do we see\nany reason to extend it to a case like this one where there was\nno possibility Ibrahim could be considered a prevailing party\nprior to the ultimate resolution of her claims.\n\n   In sum, courts assessing whether the government’s\nposition under the EAJA was substantially justified should\nengage in a single inquiry focused on the government’s\nconduct in the case as a whole. We therefore hold the district\ncourt erred in disallowing fees relating to discrete litigation\npositions taken by the government.\n\n\n 8\n    At issue in Schaefer was the point at which the EAJA’s 30-day clock\nfor a fee application begins to run following a successful social security\nappeal after the district court makes a sentence-four remand under\n42 U.S.C. § 405(g) but fails to enter a final judgment. 509 U.S. at 294–\n95. The Supreme Court held that under such facts, the time for a fee\napplication does not expire while the district court’s order remains\nappealable, and in light of the absence of a final judgment, such orders\nremain appealable even through the remanded proceedings, therefore\nmaking a post-remand EAJA application timely. Id. at 303. The Supreme\nCourt noted, however, that it was error for the district court to fail to\nenter a final judgment upon the sentence-four remand. Id. at 300–01.\nSchaefer’s upshot, therefore, was that sentence-four remands were to be\naccompanied by final judgments, which in turn, would require EAJA fee\napplications to be filed before the proceedings on remand were\nconcluded.\n\f                       IBRAHIM V. USDHS                            15\n\n                                 B.\n\n    We next address Ibrahim’s assertion that the district\ncourt erred in failing to find the government acted in bad\nfaith and by consequently imposing the EAJA’s hourly rate\ncap on the majority of her recoverable hours. 9\n\n    The EAJA mandates that the “United States . . . be liable\nfor such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other\nparty would be liable under the common law.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2412(b). The common law permits a court to assess\nattorney’s fees against a losing party that has “acted in bad\nfaith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.”\nChambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 45–46 (1991). We\nhold the government to the same standard under the EAJA,\nRodriguez, 542 F.3d at 709, and a finding that the\ngovernment acted in bad faith permits a market-rate recovery\nof attorney’s fees, Brown v. Sullivan, 916 F.2d 492, 495 (9th\nCir. 1990).\n\n    “Under the common law, a finding of bad faith is\nwarranted where an attorney knowingly or recklessly raises\na frivolous argument, or argues a meritorious claim for the\npurpose of harassing an opponent.” Rodriguez, 542 F.3d at\n709 (internal punctuation omitted) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (quoting Primus Auto. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Batarse,\n115 F.3d 644, 649 (9th Cir. 1997)). “Mere recklessness does\nnot alone constitute bad faith; rather, an award of attorney’s\nfees is justified when reckless conduct is combined with an\nadditional factor such as frivolousness, harassment, or an\nimproper purpose.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n\n 9\n   The district court permitted an upward departure for attorney James\nMcManis due to his distinctive knowledge and skills.\n\f16                  IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n(quoting Fink v. Gomez, 239 F.3d 989, 993–94 (9th Cir.\n2001)).\n\n     Ibrahim raises several arguments in support of her\ncontention that the government acted in bad faith both in the\nconduct leading to and during this action. She first argues\nthat the “Government’s refusal to acknowledge and\npermanently correct the injustice to Ibrahim, and its apparent\nlack of concern that others may have suffered harm from\nsimilar errors, show bad faith from the inception of this\ncase.” Her next contention focuses on the government’s\nraising of its standing defense after our decision in Ibrahim\nII, in which we held Ibrahim had Article III standing to\npursue her claims. 669 F.3d at 994. She also claims the\ngovernment’s invocation of the state secrets privilege was\nmade in bad faith and analogizes the government’s conduct\nhere with that in Limone v. United States, 815 F. Supp. 2d\n393 (D. Mass. 2011). Ibrahim further alleges the government\nbarred her and her daughter from entering the United States\nin an effort to prevent them from offering testimony at trial.\nAnd lastly, Ibrahim insists the district court clearly erred by\nfailing to review the record in its entirety, and instead\n“examin[ed] examples of bad conduct in isolation and\nconclud[ed] each one individually did not show bad faith,\nrather than examining the totality of the circumstances.”\n\n    We review the district court’s bad faith findings for clear\nerror. Rodriguez, 542 F.3d at 709. “A finding is clearly\nerroneous if it is ‘(1) ‘illogical’, (2) ‘implausible’, or\n(3) without ‘support in inferences that may be drawn from\nthe facts in the record.’’” Crittenden v. Chappell, 804 F.3d\n998, 1012 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Hinkson,\n585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc)). “In applying\nthe clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district\ncourt sitting without a jury, [an] appellate court[] must\n\f                        IBRAHIM V. USDHS                     17\n\nconstantly have in mind that their function is not to decide\nfactual issues de novo,” even where it is “convinced that had\nit been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the\nevidence differently.” Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,\n470 U.S. 564, 573–74 (1985). “If the district court’s account\nof the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in\nits entirety,” we must affirm. Id. We find that the district\ncourt’s account of the evidence is plausible in the light of the\nrecord, and therefore affirm.\n\n   Respecting Ibrahim’s first argument, it appears she is\nmaking two distinct claims: first, that the government\nwrongly placed her on its watchlists and therefore acted in\nbad faith, and second, that its defense of such placement was\nbad faith because it knew its conduct was wrongful. Both\ncontentions are unavailing.\n\n     The district court found that at the time the government\nplaced Ibrahim on its watchlists, including the No-Fly List,\nthere existed “no uniform standard for [watchlist]\nnominations.” It was not until after this suit was instituted\nthat the government adopted the “reasonable suspicion”\nstandard for placement on its watchlists. And although the\ngovernment admits that Ibrahim did not meet that standard\nat the time of her placement, that fact alone is insufficient to\nreverse the district court here. The district court expressly\ndeclined to find that the government’s initial interest in\nIbrahim was due to her race, religion or ethnicity. 10 Absent\nevidence Ibrahim’s inclusion on the watchlists was\notherwise improper, it was not clearly erroneous for the\ndistrict court to find the government’s underlying placement\nof Ibrahim on its watchlists did not constitute bad faith.\n\n\n 10\n      A finding Ibrahim does not challenge on appeal.\n\f18                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n    Nor was the government’s defense of its partially\nmistaken placement bad faith. Prior to this suit no court had\nheld a foreign national such as Ibrahim possessed any right\nto challenge their placement—mistaken or not—on the\ngovernment’s terrorism watchlists. It accordingly could not\nhave been bad faith to assert, as the government did, that\nIbrahim possessed no such right. And more importantly, it is\nnot true that the government defended, as Ibrahim claims, its\nplacing her on the No-Fly List. At the time this action was\ninstituted in early 2006, the government had already\nremoved Ibrahim from the No-Fly List more than a year\nprior, and, with one exception, the lists on which she did\nappear at that time were the same lists on which the\nnominating agent had intended she be placed. 11 Therefore,\nto the extent the government defended Ibrahim’s placement\non those lists, no colorable argument can be made such a\ndefense was frivolous or made with improper purpose. 12\n\n\n 11\n     The district court found the nominating agent had intended to place\nIbrahim within the Consular Lookout and Support System (“CLASS”)\nList, the TSA Selectee List, the TUSCAN List, and the TACTICS List,\nbut instead placed Ibrahim on the No-Fly List and the Interagency Border\nInformation System (“IBIS”) database. While the district court found the\ngovernment removed Ibrahim from the No-Fly List in January 2005, it\nalso found she remained on the Selectee List and CLASS Lists at that\ntime. It found that in December 2005, she was removed from the Selectee\nList, but added to the TUSCAN List and TACTICS List. Thus, when this\naction was instituted, she was on the CLASS, TACTICS and TUSCAN\nLists, which were, as the district court found, the same lists on which the\nnominating agent had intended she be placed. The district court made no\nfinding, however, whether Ibrahim was ever removed from the IBIS\ndatabase.\n\n 12\n     That the government would later determine Ibrahim did not meet\nthe reasonable suspicion standard, which was adopted subsequent to\nIbrahim’s nomination to the lists, and remove her from its watchlists is\n\f                        IBRAHIM V. USDHS                             19\n\n    The same can be said with respect to the government’s\nraising of the standing defense after our decision in Ibrahim\nII. Ibrahim fails to point to any evidence indicating the\ngovernment reraised standing as a defense at summary\njudgment and trial with vexatious purpose. What’s more, the\ngovernment correctly points out that there was at minimum\na colorable argument that the different procedural phases of\nthe case rendered their subsequent standing motions\nnonfrivolous.\n\n    Ibrahim’s claim that the government’s privilege\nassertions were made in bad faith is also unconvincing. As\nthe district court noted, the government was successful on\nmany of its privilege assertions, and on that basis it declined\nto find the government’s invocation of privilege was\nfrivolous. Ibrahim likens the government’s conduct in this\ncase with that in Limone v. United States, where a\nMassachusetts district court found the government had acted\nin bad faith by “block[ing] access to the relevant\ndocuments,” and “hiding behind specious procedural\narguments,” which “culminat[ed] in a frivolous interlocutory\nappeal.” 815 F. Supp. 2d at 398. The conduct in Limone\nincluded a refusal to disclose relevant information, even in\ncamera, until ordered by the court to do so. Id. Ibrahim sees\nsimilar conduct in this case through the government’s refusal\nto produce basic information without a court order, its\nobjections to questions at depositions, and its objections to\ndiscussing publicly available information.\n\n\nof no relevance. Ibrahim did not possess—nor did the district court find\nher to possess—a right to challenge the substantive basis for her\nplacement on the government’s watchlists. The district court’s relief was\nexplicitly limited to the government’s post-deprivation procedural\nshortcomings and expressly disavowed “[a]ny other rule requiring\nreviewability before concrete adverse action.”\n\f20                  IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n    But Ibrahim forgets that the government was ultimately\nsuccessful on at least some of its privilege assertions, and\nabsent evidence, of which Ibrahim has pointed to none, that\nthe government’s assertions on those unsuccessful occasions\nwere frivolous or made with improper purpose, it could not\nhave been clear error to decline to find the government acted\nin bad faith. Nor was the government’s action here\nanalogous to that in Limone where it had refused to grant its\nown lawyers access to the allegedly privileged documents\nwhich resulted in counsel’s inability to respond to discovery\nmotions and court orders for nearly two years. See id. at 398,\n408. There is nothing similar in this case.\n\n     Nor is there any evidence in the record demonstrating the\ngovernment prevented Ibrahim from entering the United\nStates to offer testimony in this suit, and with respect to her\ndaughter, Ibrahim fails to explain why there was any error in\nthe district court’s determination that the government’s\ninitial refusal to allow her into the country was anything but\na mistake, and a quickly corrected one at that. The district\ncourt’s findings here were not clearly erroneous.\n\n    Lastly, Ibrahim’s argument that the district court erred\nby making piecemeal bad faith determinations is\nunpersuasive. Her sole authority on point is our decision in\nMcQuiston v. Marsh, 707 F.2d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir. 1983),\nsuperseded by statute as recognized by Melkonyan v.\nSullivan, 501 U.S. 89, 96 (1991), where we made the\nunremarkable observation that “[b]ad faith may be found\neither in the action that led to the lawsuit or in the conduct\nof the litigation.” She fails, however, to point to any case\nwhere we have elevated that observation to edict. Rather, we\nhave consistently required fee awards based on bad faith to\nbe “traceable” to the conduct in question. See, e.g.,\nRodriguez, 542 F.3d at 713. It was therefore proper for the\n\f                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS                            21\n\ndistrict court to consider each claimed instance of bad faith\nin order to determine whether the associated fees should be\nsubject to a market-rate increase.\n\n                                III.\n\n   We turn to the district court’s fee reductions imposed in\naccordance with the Supreme Court’s decision in Hensley,\n461 U.S. 424.\n\n     Though a prevailing party may be eligible for fees under\nthe EAJA, 13 “[i]t remains for the district court to determine\nwhat fee is ‘reasonable.’” Id. at 433. And as the Supreme\nCourt noted, and we have often repeated, “the most useful\nstarting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee\nis the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.” Schwarz v. Sec. of\nHealth & Human Servs., 73 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(internal punctuation omitted) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n433). In the case of fees sought under the EAJA, the\n“reasonable hourly rate” is capped by the EAJA itself.\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(A). Thus, the equation for\ndetermining the reasonable amount of fees awardable in\ncases such as this is the number of hours reasonably\nexpended multiplied by the applicable EAJA rates. The\nresulting figure—the lodestar figure—forms the basis for the\nremainder of the Hensley determination.\n\n\n\n 13\n     Though Hensley addressed fees in the context of the Civil Rights\nAttorney’s Fees Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the Court went on to\nhold in Jean that the assessment of reasonable fees under the EAJA is\n“essentially the same.” 496 U.S. at 160–61. We have since applied\nHensley to EAJA fee awards. See, e.g., Atkins v. Apfel, 154 F.3d 986,\n989–90 (9th Cir. 1998).\n\f22                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n    But where a plaintiff has only achieved limited success,\nnot all hours expended on the litigation are eligible for\ninclusion in the lodestar, and even those that are eligible may\nbe subject to a discretionary reduction. Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n436; Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 901. Thus, under Hensley we have\nrequired district courts to follow a two-step process where a\nplaintiff’s success is limited: first, the court must determine\nwhether the claims upon which the plaintiff prevailed are\nrelated to the unsuccessful claims. Webb v. Sloan, 330 F.3d\n1158, 1168 (9th Cir. 2003). That inquiry rests on whether the\n“related claims involve a common core of facts or are based\non related legal theories.” Id. Time spent on unsuccessful\nclaims the court deems related are to be included in the\nlodestar, while “[h]ours expended on unrelated,\nunsuccessful claims should not be included” to the extent\nthose hours can be “isolated.” Id. at 1168, 1169. Thus, in\naddition to time reasonably spent on successful claims,\npotentially recoverable under Hensley are those hours\nexpended on related but unsuccessful claims as well as those\nhours pertaining to unrelated, unsuccessful claims that\ncannot be severed cleanly from the whole.\n\n    Second, a court must consider “whether ‘the plaintiff\nachieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably\nexpended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.’”\nSorenson, 239 F.3d at 1147 (internal punctuation omitted)\n(quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434). 14 Here, “a district court\n‘should focus on the significance of the overall relief\n\n 14\n     If the district court finds that a plaintiff was wholly successful, it\nmust still evaluate whether the degree of success obtained justifies an\naward based on the number of hours reasonably expended, whereas a\n“limited success” finding necessitates the intermediary step of\ndetermining which claims were related or unrelated before weighing the\ndegree of success obtained against the total number of hours reasonably\nexpended.\n\f                          IBRAHIM V. USDHS                                 23\n\nobtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably\nexpended on the litigation.’” Id. (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S.\nat 435).\n\n    If the court concludes the prevailing party achieved\n“excellent results,” it may permit a full fee award—that is,\nthe entirety of those hours reasonably expended on both the\nprevailing and unsuccessful but related claims. Hensley,\n461 U.S. at 435; Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 905–06. On the other\nhand, where a plaintiff has not achieved results warranting a\nfully recoverable fee, the district court may apply a\ndownward adjustment to the lodestar by “award[ing] only\nthat amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results\nobtained.” 15 Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440.\n\n    Ibrahim was successful below on her procedural due\nprocess claim. The district court, however, expressly refused\nto reach her remaining claims—which included her\nsubstantive due process, equal protection, First Amendment,\nand Administrative Procedure Act claims because “those\narguments, even if successful, would not lead to any greater\nrelief than already ordered.” It accordingly treated those\nclaims as having been unsuccessful.\n\n    It awarded full fees and expenses for those hours\nIbrahim’s counsel incurred litigating her procedural due\nprocess claim. Because it found that her unsuccessful\nsubstantive due process and Administrative Procedure Act\nclaims were related to her successful claim, it also awarded\nfees and expenses incurred prosecuting those claims. It\ndeclined to make any award for those fees and expenses\n\n  15\n     It is at this step for instance that district courts apply a reduction for\nthe inclusion of hours associated with unrelated, unsuccessful claims that\ncould not be easily segregated. Webb, 330 F.3d at 1169.\n\f24                  IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nassociated with Ibrahim’s First Amendment and equal\nprotection claims because they “were not related to the\nprocedural due process claim (for which [Ibrahim] received\nrelief) because they involve different evidence, different\ntheories, and arose from a different alleged course of\nconduct.”\n\n    Ibrahim attacks the district court’s Hensley reductions on\ntwo grounds: first, she contends it was error to conclude her\nFirst Amendment and equal protection claims were\nunrelated to her successful procedural due process claim.\nSecond, she argues the “excellent results” she obtained in\nthis litigation support a fully compensable fee. We reject\nboth assertions.\n\n    We review a district court’s award of fees under Hensley\nfor abuse of discretion, including its ruling that a party\nachieved only limited success, Thomas v. City of Tacoma,\n410 F.3d 644, 649 (9th Cir. 2005), as well as its finding that\nunsuccessful claims are unrelated to the claims upon which\na plaintiff prevailed, Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 902. Unrelated\nclaims are those that are both factually and legally distinct.\nWebb, 330 F.3d at 1168. In Schwarz, we observed “the test\n[for the factual relatedness of claims] is whether relief\nsought on the unsuccessful claim is intended to remedy a\ncourse of conduct entirely distinct and separate from the\ncourse of conduct that gave rise to the injury on which the\nrelief [is] granted.” 73 F.3d at 903 (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (quoting Thorne v. City of El Segundo, 802 F.2d\n1131, 1141 (9th Cir. 1986)). Thus, “the focus is to be on\nwhether the unsuccessful and successful claims arose out of\nthe same course of conduct,” or as the Supreme Court put it:\nthe same “common core.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435. “If they didn’t, they are\nunrelated.” Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 903.\n\f                    IBRAHIM V. USDHS                      25\n\n     The test does not require that the facts underlying the\nclaims be identical. The concept of a “common core” or\n“common course of conduct” is permissive of the incidental\nfactual differences underlying distinct legal theories. Were\nthat not the case, rare would be the occasion where legally\ndistinct claims would qualify as related under Hensley. But\nit remains true that the work done on the unsuccessful claims\nmust have contributed to the ultimate result achieved.\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 435; Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 904.\n\n    The court below disallowed fees for Ibrahim’s First\nAmendment and equal protection claims because they were\nbased on different legal theories, evidence, and “alleged”\ncourses of conduct. Ibrahim contends that reasoning was\nerroneous and in support cites Webb, 330 F.3d 1158, where\nwe addressed an EAJA fee award arising out of a suit for\nfalse arrest, malicious prosecution, and false imprisonment.\nThere we found that the “common course of conduct” was\nthe plaintiff’s “arrest, detention, and prosecution.” Id. at\n1169. In light of that formulation, we noted that the\nplaintiff’s unsuccessful false arrest claim was\n“unquestionably” related to his successful false\nimprisonment and malicious prosecution claims because\nthey each sprang from that same underlying conduct. Id. We\ntherefore concluded that work done on the plaintiff’s\nunsuccessful false imprisonment claim “could have\ncontributed to the final result achieved” and accordingly\ntreated such work as being related for Hensley purposes. Id.\n\n    What Ibrahim misses—and what distinguishes this case\nfrom Webb—is the mutually exclusive nature of the claims\npresented here. As a predicate to the Webb plaintiff’s false\nimprisonment claim, the plaintiff had to be arrested. Work\ndone investigating and developing the factual record on the\nfalse arrest claim would therefore necessarily further the\n\f26                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nplaintiff’s successful false imprisonment claim. Likewise,\nthe plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim was inextricably\ntied to the prosecutor’s state of mind in bringing the spurious\ncharges, which in turn was heavily reliant on what the\nprosecutor knew about the circumstances surrounding\nplaintiff’s arrest. Most work attributable to the plaintiff’s\nfalse arrest claim, therefore, likely also contributed to the\nplaintiff’s successful claims.\n\n    The same cannot be said for Ibrahim’s claims. In light of\nthe district court’s findings, Ibrahim’s First Amendment and\nequal protections claims were mutually exclusive with her\nprocedural due process claims. That is, if the government\nnegligently placed Ibrahim on its watchlists because it failed\nto properly fill out a form, then it could not at the same time\nhave intentionally placed Ibrahim on the list based on\nconstitutionally protected attributes Ibrahim possesses, and\nvice versa. 16 These mental states are mutually exclusive.\nTherefore, it was not an abuse of discretion to find that\nIbrahim’s unsuccessful claims were unrelated, because\nalthough the work done on those claims could have\ncontributed to her ultimately successful claim, the facts and\nlegal theories underlying Ibrahim’s claims make that result\nunlikely.\n\n    We note our prior decisions in this sphere are somewhat\nopaque. In Schwarz, we detailed our previous decisions’\nshifting focus on the degree to which the unsuccessful and\nsuccessful claims arose out of the same common course of\nconduct and the degree to which the work done on\nunsuccessful claims contributed to the results achieved.\n\n  16\n      The district court expressly declined to find that the government’s\ninitial interest in Ibrahim was due to her nationality or her religious\nbeliefs. Ibrahim does not challenge that conclusion before this Court.\n\f                     IBRAHIM V. USDHS                        27\n\n73 F.3d at 903 (citing Thorne, 802 F.2d at 1141; Outdoor\nSys., Inc. v. City of Mesa, 997 F.2d 604, 619 (9th Cir. 1993);\nHerrington v. Cty. of Sonoma, 883 F.2d 739, 747 (9th Cir.\n1989); Cabrales v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 935 F.2d 1050, 1052\n(9th Cir. 1991); and O’Neal v. City of Seattle, 66 F.3d 1064,\n1068–69 (9th Cir. 1995)). Ultimately in Schwarz, we\naffirmed the district court’s decision to reduce the lodestar\nfor work done on unsuccessful claims both because the sets\nof claims there were both factually and legally dissimilar and\nbecause the efforts spent on the unsuccessful claims did not\ncontribute to the plaintiff’s success. Id. at 904. Nevertheless\nin Webb, we characterized our decision in Schwarz as\n“reaffirm[ing] that the focus is on whether the claims arose\nout of a common course of conduct.” 330 F.3d at 1169. Here,\nIbrahim’s First Amendment and equal protection claims\nwere based on her allegations that the government\nintentionally put her name on the lists based on\nconstitutionally protected attributes, while her procedural\ndue process claims were based on her allegations that the\ngovernment failed to provide adequate procedures to remove\nher name from its lists. Accordingly, the district court did\nnot err in concluding that these claims were based on both\ndifferent alleged courses of conduct and different legal\ntheories. Further, in light of our decisions on the matter, we\nlikewise believe it cannot be error for a district court to also\nconsider—as the court below did—that efforts on\nunsuccessful claims did not contribute to the success\nobtained.\n\n    In addition, even if it were the case that Ibrahim’s\nunsuccessful claims arose out of the same factual context as\nher successful claim, it is not true that the work expended on\nthose claims necessarily contributed to her ultimate success.\nWe therefore decline to find the district court abused its\n\f28                  IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\ndiscretion by concluding Ibrahim was ineligible to recover\nfees for work on those claims.\n\n    We also reject Ibrahim’s second contention that the\n“excellent results” she obtained should entitle her to a fully\ncompensatory fee. The district court permitted Ibrahim to\nrecover fully for her Administrative Procedure Act and\nsubstantive due process claims because, though\nunsuccessful, they were related to her procedural due\nprocess claim. However, in doing so, it made no explicit\nmention of “excellent results,” though such a recovery by\nnecessity implies an “excellent results” finding. See\nSchwarz, 73 F.3d at 905–06. And in light of our affirmance\nof the district court’s ruling with respect to Ibrahim’s First\nAmendment and equal protection claims, a ruling that\nIbrahim also obtained excellent results on two of her four\nclaims would have no effect on her potentially recoverable\nfee award.\n\n    We find unconvincing, however, the government’s\ncontention that the district court’s overall fee reduction—\nincluding its EAJA reductions—should be affirmed because\nthe district court could have imposed such a reduction under\nHensley’s second step. The government claims that any\nerrors contained in the district court’s EAJA application and\nrelatedness findings is harmless. The government, however,\nforgets that although the district court enjoys substantial\ndiscretion in fixing an appropriate fee under Hensley, we\nhave imposed the modest requirement that it “explain how it\ncame up with the amount.” Moreno v. City of Sacramento,\n534 F.3d 1106, 1111 (9th Cir. 2008). “The explanation need\nnot be elaborate, but it must be comprehensible . . . [T]he\nexplanation must be concise but clear.” Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n437). Where the difference between the fee award requested\n\f                       IBRAHIM V. USDHS                           29\n\nand the fee award granted is negligible, “a somewhat cursory\nexplanation will suffice,” but where the disparity is greater,\n“a more specific articulation of the court’s reasoning is\nexpected.” Id. Whatever the actual basis for the district\ncourt’s reductions here, there is certainly no room for\nargument that it clearly and concisely explained that its\nreductions to Ibrahim’s fee award were justified in light of\nthe success she obtained. Absent such an explanation from\nthe district court, we cannot take a rough justice approach\nand sua sponte decide that the district court’s mistaken fee\nreductions would be equivalent to the fee reductions it would\nhave made at Hensley’s second step.\n\n                                IV.\n\n    Following its fee entitlement determination, the district\ncourt appointed a special master to fix Ibrahim’s fee award. 17\nThe special master went on to recommend a number of\ndiscretionary reductions to Ibrahim’s fee request due to\nblock-billing, vagueness, and lack of billing judgment. The\nspecial master also made reductions for failure to\ndemonstrate that the work claimed was associated with\nrecoverable claims or issues. The district court adopted these\nreductions. It also struck Ibrahim’s objections to the special\nmaster’s report and recommendation on expenses for failure\nto follow page limits.\n\n    Because the reductions recommended by the special\nmaster and adopted by the district court were largely rooted\nin the district court’s EAJA determination, we agree with\nIbrahim that those findings should be revisited if the district\ncourt once more determines Ibrahim is entitled to fees.\n\n  17\n     Though Ibrahim objected to the special master’s appointment, she\ndoes not press that issue on appeal.\n\f30                       IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nIbrahim’s contention that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in striking her objections to the special master’s\nreport and recommendation on expenses, however, is\nunavailing.\n\n    In its order appointing the special master, the district\ncourt also ordered the special master to file a report and\nrecommendation regarding fees and expenses, and imposed\na ten-page limit on the parties’ objections to that report and\nrecommendation. It further required each party to file an\nappendix of all relevant communication with the special\nmaster.\n\n    The special master, however, filed two reports and\nrecommendations, one focusing on fees and the other on\nexpenses. In response, Ibrahim filed a ten-page set of\nobjections to each, along with a one-page “statement.”\n\n   The district court struck Ibrahim’s objections to the\nspecial master’s report and recommendation on expenses for\nhaving filed “two ten-page briefs, a 234-page declaration\nwith exhibits, and a one-page ‘statement,’” without also\nmoving for a page extension. It found her filings were not\ngood faith attempts to abide by its orders.\n\n    On appeal Ibrahim argues it was improper to strike her\nobjections because the special master filed two reports and\nrecommendations, and, therefore, it was reasonable to file a\nten-page set of objections to each. 18 She alternatively argues\n\n 18\n     Ibrahim also argues that the district court’s striking of her expenses\nresulted only in those objections being “overruled.” That assertion is\npatently contradicted by the record. In its order striking Ibrahim’s\nobjections, the district court stated: “No objections to the special\nmaster’s report regarding expenses are preserved because counsel failed\nto abide by the rules.”\n\f                     IBRAHIM V. USDHS                          31\n\nthat the district court’s imposition of a ten-page limit on\nobjections to reports and recommendations totaling\nhundreds of pages was also an abuse of discretion.\n\n    District courts have the inherent power to strike items\nfrom their docket for litigation conduct. Ready Transp., Inc.\nv. AAR Mfg., Inc., 627 F.3d 402, 404 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing\nHernandez v. City of El Monte, 138 F.3d 393, 398 (9th Cir.\n1998)). We review the exercise of that power for abuse of\ndiscretion and the factual determinations underpinning such\nexercise for clear error. Id. at 404; Unigard Sec. Ins. Co. v.\nLakewood Eng’g & Mfg. Corp., 982 F.2d 363, 367 (9th Cir.\n1992).\n\n     Here, it was not clearly erroneous to conclude Ibrahim\nfailed to abide by the district court’s page limits. While it is\ntrue that the special master filed two reports and\nrecommendations and the district court’s order might have\nbeen misinterpreted or misunderstood by plaintiff’s counsel,\nit is also true that the order stated “all objections” should not\nexceed ten pages. Thus, whether the special master filed a\nsingle or several reports and recommendations, the district\ncourt’s order imposed a ten-page limit on objections. Indeed,\nthe government restricted its objections to ten pages. We\ntherefore cannot find that it was clearly erroneous to\nconclude Ibrahim failed to abide by the district court’s page\nrestrictions.\n\n    Nor do we see the striking of Ibrahim’s objections in\nresponse to that failure as being an abuse of discretion. The\norder in question also required Ibrahim to resubmit her fee\nrequest and imposed requirements on that resubmission in\norder to facilitate the district court’s efforts to fix her award.\n\n   Ibrahim obstinately refused to abide by those\nrequirements, and instead, filed multiple motions to\n\f32                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nreconsider the district court’s fee entitlement\ndeterminations. 19 In light of Ibrahim’s repeated failures to\nfollow the very same order, we cannot conclude the district\ncourt abused its discretion by striking her objections to the\nspecial mater’s report on expenses.\n\n     Finally, we refuse to address Ibrahim’s contention that it\nwas an abuse of discretion to limit her objections to ten\npages. Where a party believes a district court has issued an\nimproper order, their remedy is to raise that issue on appeal.\nUnited States v. Galin, 222 F.3d 1123, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).\nIn the meantime, however, they are to either abide by the\norder, file an interlocutory appeal, if available, or move for\nreconsideration. Id. Ibrahim did none of those things. Rather,\nshe simply exceeded the district court’s page limits while\n“objecting” to those selfsame limits in a footnote. A party\nwill not be heard to complain of an order on appeal by which\nit failed to abide. We therefore do not reach the merits of\nIbrahim’s claim here.\n\n                                   V.\n\n     Any fee dispute is tedious, and this one is no exception.\nThough we are reluctant to require the district court to revisit\nits findings in this already protracted satellite litigation, we\n\n  19\n      Ibrahim offered multiple rationales for her refusal to follow the\ndistrict court’s order that she resubmit her fee request. Initially, she\nargued that counsel had previously been awarded fees based on similar\nbilling records. She also argued she would be unable to categorize\nprojects in the manner directed by the district court because “that is not\nthe way the time was recorded or billed.” At oral argument, however, she\nargued she could not comply with the district court’s order because it\nwas predicated on legally erroneous conclusions. We find none of these\nrationales persuasive because Ibrahim, in the end, failed to comport with\nthe order.\n\f                    IBRAHIM V. USDHS                        33\n\nsee no other alternative. We pause to note, however, that we\noffer no view on the appropriateness of the amount already\nawarded by the district court in this case. It may well be\nIbrahim is entitled to substantially more or substantially less\nthan that amount. But until an amount is fixed in accordance\nwith applicable law, we are unable to pass upon that\nquestion.\n\n    The present panel will retain responsibility for any\nappeals that may possibly emanate from an appealable order\nor judgment of the district court resulting from this remand.\nThe fee and expense awards of the district court are\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and\nREMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

As a result, Ibrahim was placed on the No-\nFly List and another terrorist screening watchlist, rather than\nthe lists on which the FBI agent had intended she be placed.\nId. Accordingly, the court below ruled in favor of Ibrahim\n\n    1\n    At the time of trial, the only remaining claims were those against the\nfederal defendants arising from their placement of Ibrahim on the\ngovernment’s terrorism watchlists, as well as their revocation and\nsubsequent denial of Ibrahim’s entry visas.\n\n  2\n     The district court’s factual findings are not challenged on appeal;\nunless otherwise noted, factual assertions contained herein reflect those\nfindings.\n\f                    IBRAHIM V.

Lastly, on additional independent grounds,\nthe district court granted further relief by finding that the\nconsular officer who denied Ibrahim her visa erred in\nindicating she could not apply for a discretionary waiver of\nher ineligibility. The district court ordered the government\nto permit such a waiver application.\n\n    The district court did not reach the remainder of\nIbrahim’s other claims which included her First\nAmendment, substantive due process, equal protection, and\nAdministrative Procedure Act claims because, in its view,\n\f8                      IBRAHIM V.

That formulation implicitly permits the\ngovernment some leeway, so long as its conduct on the\nwhole remained justified. Whether those portions of the case\non which the government was not substantially justified are\nsufficient to warrant fee shifting on the case as a whole is a\nquestion left to the evaluating court’s discretion. But that a\nsituation may arise where a court may deny a prevailing\nparty fees even though the government was not substantially\njustified as to every position it took does not trouble us.

As a result, we shifted focus from\n“considering only [whether the government was\nsubstantially justified as to] the ultimate issue of disability to\nconsidering the justification of the government’s position at\nthe discrete stage in question.” Id. We have never applied\nCorbin outside of the social security context, nor do we see\nany reason to extend it to a case like this one where there was\nno possibility Ibrahim could be considered a prevailing party\nprior to the ultimate resolution of her claims.\n\n   In sum, courts assessing whether the government’s\nposition under the EAJA was substantially justified should\nengage in a single inquiry focused on the government’s\nconduct in the case as a whole. We therefore hold the district\ncourt erred in disallowing fees relating to discrete litigation\npositions taken by the government.\n\n\n 8\n    At issue in Schaefer was the point at which the EAJA’s 30-day clock\nfor a fee application begins to run following a successful social security\nappeal after the district court makes a sentence-four remand under\n42 U.S.C. § 405(g) but fails to enter a final judgment. 509 U.S. at 294–\n95. The Supreme Court held that under such facts, the time for a fee\napplication does not expire while the district court’s order remains\nappealable, and in light of the absence of a final judgment, such orders\nremain appealable even through the remanded proceedings, therefore\nmaking a post-remand EAJA application timely. Id. at 303. The Supreme\nCourt noted, however, that it was error for the district court to fail to\nenter a final judgment upon the sentence-four remand. Id. at 300–01.\nSchaefer’s upshot, therefore, was that sentence-four remands were to be\naccompanied by final judgments, which in turn, would require EAJA fee\napplications to be filed before the proceedings on remand were\nconcluded.\n\f                       IBRAHIM V.

Id. We find that the district\ncourt’s account of the evidence is plausible in the light of the\nrecord, and therefore affirm.\n\n   Respecting Ibrahim’s first argument, it appears she is\nmaking two distinct claims: first, that the government\nwrongly placed her on its watchlists and therefore acted in\nbad faith, and second, that its defense of such placement was\nbad faith because it knew its conduct was wrongful. Both\ncontentions are unavailing.\n\n     The district court found that at the time the government\nplaced Ibrahim on its watchlists, including the No-Fly List,\nthere existed “no uniform standard for [watchlist]\nnominations.” It was not until after this suit was instituted\nthat the government adopted the “reasonable suspicion”\nstandard for placement on its watchlists. And although the\ngovernment admits that Ibrahim did not meet that standard\nat the time of her placement, that fact alone is insufficient to\nreverse the district court here. The district court expressly\ndeclined to find that the government’s initial interest in\nIbrahim was due to her race, religion or ethnicity. 10 Absent\nevidence Ibrahim’s inclusion on the watchlists was\notherwise improper, it was not clearly erroneous for the\ndistrict court to find the government’s underlying placement\nof Ibrahim on its watchlists did not constitute bad faith.\n\n\n 10\n      A finding Ibrahim does not challenge on appeal.\n\f18                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\n    Nor was the government’s defense of its partially\nmistaken placement bad faith. Prior to this suit no court had\nheld a foreign national such as Ibrahim possessed any right\nto challenge their placement—mistaken or not—on the\ngovernment’s terrorism watchlists. It accordingly could not\nhave been bad faith to assert, as the government did, that\nIbrahim possessed no such right. And more importantly, it is\nnot true that the government defended, as Ibrahim claims, its\nplacing her on the No-Fly List. At the time this action was\ninstituted in early 2006, the government had already\nremoved Ibrahim from the No-Fly List more than a year\nprior, and, with one exception, the lists on which she did\nappear at that time were the same lists on which the\nnominating agent had intended she be placed. 11 Therefore,\nto the extent the government defended Ibrahim’s placement\non those lists, no colorable argument can be made such a\ndefense was frivolous or made with improper purpose. 12\n\n\n 11\n     The district court found the nominating agent had intended to place\nIbrahim within the Consular Lookout and Support System (“CLASS”)\nList, the TSA Selectee List, the TUSCAN List, and the TACTICS List,\nbut instead placed Ibrahim on the No-Fly List and the Interagency Border\nInformation System (“IBIS”) database. While the district court found the\ngovernment removed Ibrahim from the No-Fly List in January 2005, it\nalso found she remained on the Selectee List and CLASS Lists at that\ntime. It found that in December 2005, she was removed from the Selectee\nList, but added to the TUSCAN List and TACTICS List. Thus, when this\naction was instituted, she was on the CLASS, TACTICS and TUSCAN\nLists, which were, as the district court found, the same lists on which the\nnominating agent had intended she be placed. The district court made no\nfinding, however, whether Ibrahim was ever removed from the IBIS\ndatabase.\n\n 12\n     That the government would later determine Ibrahim did not meet\nthe reasonable suspicion standard, which was adopted subsequent to\nIbrahim’s nomination to the lists, and remove her from its watchlists is\n\f                        IBRAHIM V. USDHS                             19\n\n    The same can be said with respect to the government’s\nraising of the standing defense after our decision in Ibrahim\nII. Ibrahim fails to point to any evidence indicating the\ngovernment reraised standing as a defense at summary\njudgment and trial with vexatious purpose. What’s more, the\ngovernment correctly points out that there was at minimum\na colorable argument that the different procedural phases of\nthe case rendered their subsequent standing motions\nnonfrivolous.\n\n    Ibrahim’s claim that the government’s privilege\nassertions were made in bad faith is also unconvincing. As\nthe district court noted, the government was successful on\nmany of its privilege assertions, and on that basis it declined\nto find the government’s invocation of privilege was\nfrivolous. Ibrahim likens the government’s conduct in this\ncase with that in Limone v. United States, where a\nMassachusetts district court found the government had acted\nin bad faith by “block[ing] access to the relevant\ndocuments,” and “hiding behind specious procedural\narguments,” which “culminat[ed] in a frivolous interlocutory\nappeal.” 815 F. Supp. 2d at 398. The conduct in Limone\nincluded a refusal to disclose relevant information, even in\ncamera, until ordered by the court to do so. Id. Ibrahim sees\nsimilar conduct in this case through the government’s refusal\nto produce basic information without a court order, its\nobjections to questions at depositions, and its objections to\ndiscussing publicly available information.\n\n\nof no relevance. Ibrahim did not possess—nor did the district court find\nher to possess—a right to challenge the substantive basis for her\nplacement on the government’s watchlists.

In the case of fees sought under the EAJA, the\n“reasonable hourly rate” is capped by the EAJA itself.\n28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(A). Thus, the equation for\ndetermining the reasonable amount of fees awardable in\ncases such as this is the number of hours reasonably\nexpended multiplied by the applicable EAJA rates.

Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n436; Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 901. Thus, under Hensley we have\nrequired district courts to follow a two-step process where a\nplaintiff’s success is limited: first, the court must determine\nwhether the claims upon which the plaintiff prevailed are\nrelated to the unsuccessful claims. Webb v. Sloan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782175\"><a href=\"/opinion/782175/david-q-webb-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-darrin-sloan-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1168 (9th Cir. 2003). That inquiry rests on whether the\n“related claims involve a common core of facts or are based\non related legal theories.” Id. Time spent on unsuccessful\nclaims the court deems related are to be included in the\nlodestar, while “[h]ours expended on unrelated,\nunsuccessful claims should not be included” to the extent\nthose hours can be “isolated.” Id. at 1168, 1169. Thus, in\naddition to time reasonably spent on successful claims,\npotentially recoverable under Hensley are those hours\nexpended on related but unsuccessful claims as well as those\nhours pertaining to unrelated, unsuccessful claims that\ncannot be severed cleanly from the whole.\n\n    Second, a court must consider “whether ‘the plaintiff\nachieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably\nexpended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.’”\nSorenson, 239 F.3d at 1147 (internal punctuation omitted)\n(quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434). 14 Here, “a district court\n‘should focus on the significance of the overall relief\n\n 14\n     If the district court finds that a plaintiff was wholly successful, it\nmust still evaluate whether the degree of success obtained justifies an\naward based on the number of hours reasonably expended, whereas a\n“limited success” finding necessitates the intermediary step of\ndetermining which claims were related or unrelated before weighing the\ndegree of success obtained against the total number of hours reasonably\nexpended.\n\f                          IBRAHIM V.

(quoting Hensley, 461 U.S.\nat 435).\n\n    If the court concludes the prevailing party achieved\n“excellent results,” it may permit a full fee award—that is,\nthe entirety of those hours reasonably expended on both the\nprevailing and unsuccessful but related claims. Hensley,\n461 U.S. at 435; Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 905–06. On the other\nhand, where a plaintiff has not achieved results warranting a\nfully recoverable fee, the district court may apply a\ndownward adjustment to the lodestar by “award[ing] only\nthat amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results\nobtained.” 15 Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440.\n\n    Ibrahim was successful below on her procedural due\nprocess claim. The district court, however, expressly refused\nto reach her remaining claims—which included her\nsubstantive due process, equal protection, First Amendment,\nand Administrative Procedure Act claims because “those\narguments, even if successful, would not lead to any greater\nrelief than already ordered.” It accordingly treated those\nclaims as having been unsuccessful.\n\n    It awarded full fees and expenses for those hours\nIbrahim’s counsel incurred litigating her procedural due\nprocess claim. Because it found that her unsuccessful\nsubstantive due process and Administrative Procedure Act\nclaims were related to her successful claim, it also awarded\nfees and expenses incurred prosecuting those claims. It\ndeclined to make any award for those fees and expenses\n\n  15\n     It is at this step for instance that district courts apply a reduction for\nthe inclusion of hours associated with unrelated, unsuccessful claims that\ncould not be easily segregated.

Unrelated\nclaims are those that are both factually and legally distinct.\nWebb, 330 F.3d at 1168. In Schwarz, we observed “the test\n[for the factual relatedness of claims] is whether relief\nsought on the unsuccessful claim is intended to remedy a\ncourse of conduct entirely distinct and separate from the\ncourse of conduct that gave rise to the injury on which the\nrelief [is] granted.” 73 F.3d at 903 (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (quoting Thorne v.

USDHS                      25\n\n     The test does not require that the facts underlying the\nclaims be identical. The concept of a “common core” or\n“common course of conduct” is permissive of the incidental\nfactual differences underlying distinct legal theories. Were\nthat not the case, rare would be the occasion where legally\ndistinct claims would qualify as related under Hensley. But\nit remains true that the work done on the unsuccessful claims\nmust have contributed to the ultimate result achieved.\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 435; Schwarz, 73 F.3d at 904.\n\n    The court below disallowed fees for Ibrahim’s First\nAmendment and equal protection claims because they were\nbased on different legal theories, evidence, and “alleged”\ncourses of conduct. Ibrahim contends that reasoning was\nerroneous and in support cites Webb, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782175\"><a href=\"/opinion/782175/david-q-webb-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-darrin-sloan-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where\nwe addressed an EAJA fee award arising out of a suit for\nfalse arrest, malicious prosecution, and false imprisonment.\nThere we found that the “common course of conduct” was\nthe plaintiff’s “arrest, detention, and prosecution.” Id. at\n1169. In light of that formulation, we noted that the\nplaintiff’s unsuccessful false arrest claim was\n“unquestionably” related to his successful false\nimprisonment and malicious prosecution claims because\nthey each sprang from that same underlying conduct. Id. We\ntherefore concluded that work done on the plaintiff’s\nunsuccessful false imprisonment claim “could have\ncontributed to the final result achieved” and accordingly\ntreated such work as being related for Hensley purposes. Id.\n\n    What Ibrahim misses—and what distinguishes this case\nfrom Webb—is the mutually exclusive nature of the claims\npresented here. As a predicate to the Webb plaintiff’s false\nimprisonment claim, the plaintiff had to be arrested. Work\ndone investigating and developing the factual record on the\nfalse arrest claim would therefore necessarily further the\n\f26                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nplaintiff’s successful false imprisonment claim. Likewise,\nthe plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim was inextricably\ntied to the prosecutor’s state of mind in bringing the spurious\ncharges, which in turn was heavily reliant on what the\nprosecutor knew about the circumstances surrounding\nplaintiff’s arrest. Most work attributable to the plaintiff’s\nfalse arrest claim, therefore, likely also contributed to the\nplaintiff’s successful claims.\n\n    The same cannot be said for Ibrahim’s claims. In light of\nthe district court’s findings, Ibrahim’s First Amendment and\nequal protections claims were mutually exclusive with her\nprocedural due process claims. That is, if the government\nnegligently placed Ibrahim on its watchlists because it failed\nto properly fill out a form, then it could not at the same time\nhave intentionally placed Ibrahim on the list based on\nconstitutionally protected attributes Ibrahim possesses, and\nvice versa. 16 These mental states are mutually exclusive.\nTherefore, it was not an abuse of discretion to find that\nIbrahim’s unsuccessful claims were unrelated, because\nalthough the work done on those claims could have\ncontributed to her ultimately successful claim, the facts and\nlegal theories underlying Ibrahim’s claims make that result\nunlikely.\n\n    We note our prior decisions in this sphere are somewhat\nopaque. In Schwarz, we detailed our previous decisions’\nshifting focus on the degree to which the unsuccessful and\nsuccessful claims arose out of the same common course of\nconduct and the degree to which the work done on\nunsuccessful claims contributed to the results achieved.\n\n  16\n      The district court expressly declined to find that the government’s\ninitial interest in Ibrahim was due to her nationality or her religious\nbeliefs. Ibrahim does not challenge that conclusion before this Court.\n\f                     IBRAHIM V.

Ultimately in Schwarz, we\naffirmed the district court’s decision to reduce the lodestar\nfor work done on unsuccessful claims both because the sets\nof claims there were both factually and legally dissimilar and\nbecause the efforts spent on the unsuccessful claims did not\ncontribute to the plaintiff’s success. Id. at 904. Nevertheless\nin Webb, we characterized our decision in Schwarz as\n“reaffirm[ing] that the focus is on whether the claims arose\nout of a common course of conduct.” 330 F.3d at 1169. Here,\nIbrahim’s First Amendment and equal protection claims\nwere based on her allegations that the government\nintentionally put her name on the lists based on\nconstitutionally protected attributes, while her procedural\ndue process claims were based on her allegations that the\ngovernment failed to provide adequate procedures to remove\nher name from its lists. Accordingly, the district court did\nnot err in concluding that these claims were based on both\ndifferent alleged courses of conduct and different legal\ntheories. Further, in light of our decisions on the matter, we\nlikewise believe it cannot be error for a district court to also\nconsider—as the court below did—that efforts on\nunsuccessful claims did not contribute to the success\nobtained.\n\n    In addition, even if it were the case that Ibrahim’s\nunsuccessful claims arose out of the same factual context as\nher successful claim, it is not true that the work expended on\nthose claims necessarily contributed to her ultimate success.\nWe therefore decline to find the district court abused its\n\f28                  IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\ndiscretion by concluding Ibrahim was ineligible to recover\nfees for work on those claims.\n\n    We also reject Ibrahim’s second contention that the\n“excellent results” she obtained should entitle her to a fully\ncompensatory fee. The district court permitted Ibrahim to\nrecover fully for her Administrative Procedure Act and\nsubstantive due process claims because, though\nunsuccessful, they were related to her procedural due\nprocess claim. However, in doing so, it made no explicit\nmention of “excellent results,” though such a recovery by\nnecessity implies an “excellent results” finding. See\nSchwarz, 73 F.3d at 905–06. And in light of our affirmance\nof the district court’s ruling with respect to Ibrahim’s First\nAmendment and equal protection claims, a ruling that\nIbrahim also obtained excellent results on two of her four\nclaims would have no effect on her potentially recoverable\nfee award.\n\n    We find unconvincing, however, the government’s\ncontention that the district court’s overall fee reduction—\nincluding its EAJA reductions—should be affirmed because\nthe district court could have imposed such a reduction under\nHensley’s second step. The government claims that any\nerrors contained in the district court’s EAJA application and\nrelatedness findings is harmless. The government, however,\nforgets that although the district court enjoys substantial\ndiscretion in fixing an appropriate fee under Hensley, we\nhave imposed the modest requirement that it “explain how it\ncame up with the amount.” Moreno v.

Whatever the actual basis for the district\ncourt’s reductions here, there is certainly no room for\nargument that it clearly and concisely explained that its\nreductions to Ibrahim’s fee award were justified in light of\nthe success she obtained. Absent such an explanation from\nthe district court, we cannot take a rough justice approach\nand sua sponte decide that the district court’s mistaken fee\nreductions would be equivalent to the fee reductions it would\nhave made at Hensley’s second step.\n\n                                IV.\n\n    Following its fee entitlement determination, the district\ncourt appointed a special master to fix Ibrahim’s fee award. 17\nThe special master went on to recommend a number of\ndiscretionary reductions to Ibrahim’s fee request due to\nblock-billing, vagueness, and lack of billing judgment. The\nspecial master also made reductions for failure to\ndemonstrate that the work claimed was associated with\nrecoverable claims or issues. The district court adopted these\nreductions. It also struck Ibrahim’s objections to the special\nmaster’s report and recommendation on expenses for failure\nto follow page limits.\n\n    Because the reductions recommended by the special\nmaster and adopted by the district court were largely rooted\nin the district court’s EAJA determination, we agree with\nIbrahim that those findings should be revisited if the district\ncourt once more determines Ibrahim is entitled to fees.\n\n  17\n     Though Ibrahim objected to the special master’s appointment, she\ndoes not press that issue on appeal.\n\f30                       IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nIbrahim’s contention that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in striking her objections to the special master’s\nreport and recommendation on expenses, however, is\nunavailing.\n\n    In its order appointing the special master, the district\ncourt also ordered the special master to file a report and\nrecommendation regarding fees and expenses, and imposed\na ten-page limit on the parties’ objections to that report and\nrecommendation. It further required each party to file an\nappendix of all relevant communication with the special\nmaster.\n\n    The special master, however, filed two reports and\nrecommendations, one focusing on fees and the other on\nexpenses. In response, Ibrahim filed a ten-page set of\nobjections to each, along with a one-page “statement.”\n\n   The district court struck Ibrahim’s objections to the\nspecial master’s report and recommendation on expenses for\nhaving filed “two ten-page briefs, a 234-page declaration\nwith exhibits, and a one-page ‘statement,’” without also\nmoving for a page extension. It found her filings were not\ngood faith attempts to abide by its orders.\n\n    On appeal Ibrahim argues it was improper to strike her\nobjections because the special master filed two reports and\nrecommendations, and, therefore, it was reasonable to file a\nten-page set of objections to each. 18 She alternatively argues\n\n 18\n     Ibrahim also argues that the district court’s striking of her expenses\nresulted only in those objections being “overruled.” That assertion is\npatently contradicted by the record.

While it is\ntrue that the special master filed two reports and\nrecommendations and the district court’s order might have\nbeen misinterpreted or misunderstood by plaintiff’s counsel,\nit is also true that the order stated “all objections” should not\nexceed ten pages. Thus, whether the special master filed a\nsingle or several reports and recommendations, the district\ncourt’s order imposed a ten-page limit on objections.

The\norder in question also required Ibrahim to resubmit her fee\nrequest and imposed requirements on that resubmission in\norder to facilitate the district court’s efforts to fix her award.\n\n   Ibrahim obstinately refused to abide by those\nrequirements, and instead, filed multiple motions to\n\f32                      IBRAHIM V. USDHS\n\nreconsider the district court’s fee entitlement\ndeterminations. 19 In light of Ibrahim’s repeated failures to\nfollow the very same order, we cannot conclude the district\ncourt abused its discretion by striking her objections to the\nspecial mater’s report on expenses.\n\n     Finally, we refuse to address Ibrahim’s contention that it\nwas an abuse of discretion to limit her objections to ten\npages. Where a party believes a district court has issued an\nimproper order, their remedy is to raise that issue on appeal.\nUnited States v. Galin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769933\"><a href=\"/opinion/769933/united-states-v-miles-a-galin-robert-e-goldman-contemnor-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).\nIn the meantime, however, they are to either abide by the\norder, file an interlocutory appeal, if available, or move for\nreconsideration. Id. Ibrahim did none of those things. Rather,\nshe simply exceeded the district court’s page limits while\n“objecting” to those selfsame limits in a footnote. A party\nwill not be heard to complain of an order on appeal by which\nit failed to abide. We therefore do not reach the merits of\nIbrahim’s claim here.\n\n                                   V.\n\n     Any fee dispute is tedious, and this one is no exception.\nThough we are reluctant to require the district court to revisit\nits findings in this already protracted satellite litigation, we\n\n  19\n      Ibrahim offered multiple rationales for her refusal to follow the\ndistrict court’s order that she resubmit her fee request. Initially, she\nargued that counsel had previously been awarded fees based on similar\nbilling records. She also argued she would be unable to categorize\nprojects in the manner directed by the district court because “that is not\nthe way the time was recorded or billed.” At oral argument, however, she\nargued she could not comply with the district court’s order because it\nwas predicated on legally erroneous conclusions. We find none of these\nrationales persuasive because Ibrahim, in the end, failed to comport with\nthe order.\n\f                    IBRAHIM V. USDHS                        33\n\nsee no other alternative. We pause to note, however, that we\noffer no view on the appropriateness of the amount already\nawarded by the district court in this case. It may well be\nIbrahim is entitled to substantially more or substantially less\nthan that amount. But until an amount is fixed in accordance\nwith applicable law, we are unable to pass upon that\nquestion.\n\n    The present panel will retain responsibility for any\nappeals that may possibly emanate from an appealable order\nor judgment of the district court resulting from this remand.\nThe fee and expense awards of the district court are\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and\nREMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
