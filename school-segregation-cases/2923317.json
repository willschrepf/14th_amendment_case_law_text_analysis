On that day, the People of California\nadopted Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution\nto eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. We con-\nsider whether that amendment violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. We conclude\nthat it does.\n\n   Although the Constitution permits communities to enact\nmost laws they believe to be desirable, it requires that there\nbe at least a legitimate reason for the passage of a law that\ntreats different classes of people differently. There was no\nsuch reason that Proposition 8 could have been enacted.\nBecause under California statutory law, same-sex couples had\nall the rights of opposite-sex couples, regardless of their mari-\ntal status, all parties agree that Proposition 8 had one effect\nonly. It stripped same-sex couples of the ability they previ-\nously possessed to obtain from the State, or any other autho-\nrized party, an important right—the right to obtain and use the\ndesignation of ‘marriage’ to describe their relationships.\nNothing more, nothing less. Proposition 8 therefore could not\nhave been enacted to advance California’s interests in child-\nrearing or responsible procreation, for it had no effect on the\n\f1588                    PERRY v. BROWN\nrights of same-sex couples to raise children or on the procre-\native practices of other couples. Nor did Proposition 8 have\nany effect on religious freedom or on parents’ rights to control\ntheir children’s education; it could not have been enacted to\nsafeguard these liberties.\n\n   All that Proposition 8 accomplished was to take away from\nsame-sex couples the right to be granted marriage licenses\nand thus legally to use the designation of ‘marriage,’ which\nsymbolizes state legitimization and societal recognition of\ntheir committed relationships. Proposition 8 serves no pur-\npose, and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and\nhuman dignity of gays and lesbians in California, and to offi-\ncially reclassify their relationships and families as inferior to\nthose of opposite-sex couples. The Constitution simply does\nnot allow for “laws of this sort.” Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S.\n620, 633 (1996).\n\n   “Broader issues have been urged for our consideration, but\nwe adhere to the principle of deciding constitutional questions\nonly in the context of the particular case before the Court.”\nSweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 631 (1950). Whether under\nthe Constitution same-sex couples may ever be denied the\nright to marry, a right that has long been enjoyed by opposite-\nsex couples, is an important and highly controversial question.\nIt is currently a matter of great debate in our nation, and an\nissue over which people of good will may disagree, some-\ntimes strongly. Of course, when questions of constitutional\nlaw are necessary to the resolution of a case, courts may not\nand should not abstain from deciding them simply because\nthey are controversial. We need not and do not answer the\nbroader question in this case, however, because California had\nalready extended to committed same-sex couples both the\nincidents of marriage and the official designation of ‘mar-\nriage,’ and Proposition 8’s only effect was to take away that\nimportant and legally significant designation, while leaving in\nplace all of its incidents. This unique and strictly limited\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1589\neffect of Proposition 8 allows us to address the amendment’s\nconstitutionality on narrow grounds.\n\n   Thus, as a result of our “traditional reluctance to extend\nconstitutional interpretations to situations or facts which are\nnot before the Court, much of the excellent research and\ndetailed argument presented in th[is] case[ ] is unnecessary to\n[its] disposition.” Id. Were we unable, however, to resolve the\nmatter on the basis we do, we would not hesitate to proceed\nto the broader question—the constitutionality of denying\nsame-sex couples the right to marry.\n\n   Before considering the constitutional question of the valid-\nity of Proposition 8’s elimination of the rights of same-sex\ncouples to marry, we first decide that the official sponsors of\nProposition 8 are entitled to appeal the decision below, which\ndeclared the measure unconstitutional and enjoined its\nenforcement. The California Constitution and Elections Code\nendow the official sponsors of an initiative measure with the\nauthority to represent the State’s interest in establishing the\nvalidity of a measure enacted by the voters, when the State’s\nelected leaders refuse to do so. See Perry v. Brown, 134 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 499 (2011). It is for the State of California to decide\nwho may assert its interests in litigation, and we respect its\ndecision by holding that Proposition 8’s proponents have\nstanding to bring this appeal on behalf of the State. We there-\nfore conclude that, through the proponents of ballot measures,\nthe People of California must be allowed to defend in federal\ncourts, including on appeal, the validity of their use of the ini-\ntiative power. Here, however, their defense fails on the merits.\nThe People may not employ the initiative power to single out\na disfavored group for unequal treatment and strip them, with-\nout a legitimate justification, of a right as important as the\nright to marry. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n   We also affirm—for substantially the reasons set forth in\nthe district court’s opinion—the denial of the motion by the\n\f1590                    PERRY v. BROWN\nofficial sponsors of Proposition 8 to vacate the judgment\nentered by former Chief Judge Walker, on the basis of his\npurported interest in being allowed to marry his same-sex\npartner.\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Upon its founding, the State of California recognized the\nlegal institution of civil marriage for its residents. See, e.g.,\nCal. Const. of 1849, art. XI, §§ 12, 14 (discussing marriage\ncontracts and marital property); Cal. Stats. 1850, ch. 140 (“An\nAct regulating Marriages”). Marriage in California was under-\nstood, at the time and well into the twentieth century, to be\nlimited to relationships between a man and a woman. See In\nre Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 407-09 (Cal. 2008). In\n1977, that much was made explicit by the California Legisla-\nture, which amended the marriage statute to read, “Marriage\nis a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between\na man and a woman, to which the consent of the parties capa-\nble of making that contract is necessary.” Cal. Stats. 1977, ch.\n339, § 1. The 1977 provision remains codified in California\nstatute. See Cal. Fam. Code § 300(a).\n\n   Following the enactment of the Defense of Marriage Act of\n1996, Pub. L. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419 (codified in relevant\npart at 1 U.S.C. § 7), which expressly limited the federal defi-\nnition of marriage to relationships between one man and one\nwoman, dozens of states enacted similar provisions into state\nlaw. See Andrew Koppelman, The Difference the Mini-\nDOMAs Make, 38 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. 265, 265-66 (2007). Cali-\nfornia did so in 2000 by adopting Proposition 22, an initiative\nstatute, which provided, “Only marriage between a man and\na woman is valid or recognized in California.” Cal. Fam.\nCode § 308.5. The proposition ensured that same-sex mar-\nriages performed in any state that might permit such mar-\nriages in the future would not be recognized in California, and\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                        1591\nit guaranteed that any legislative repeal of the 1977 statute\nwould not allow same-sex couples to marry within the State,\nbecause the Legislature may not amend or repeal an initiative\nstatute enacted by the People. See Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d\nat 409-10.\n\n   Meanwhile, however, California had created the designa-\ntion “domestic partnership” for “two adults who have chosen\nto share one another’s lives in an intimate and committed rela-\ntionship of mutual caring.” Cal. Stats. 1999, ch. 588, § 2 (cod-\nified at Cal. Fam. Code § 297(a)). At first, California gave\nregistered domestic partners only limited rights, such as hos-\npital visitation privileges, id. § 4, and health benefits for the\ndomestic partners of certain state employees, id. § 3. Over the\nnext several years, however, the State substantially expanded\nthe rights of domestic partners. By 2008, “California statutory\nprovisions generally afford[ed] same-sex couples the opportu-\nnity to . . . obtain virtually all of the benefits and responsibili-\nties afforded by California law to married opposite-sex\ncouples.” Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 417-18. The 2003\nDomestic Partner Act provided broadly: “Registered domestic\npartners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits,\nand shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations,\nand duties under law, whether they derive from statutes,\nadministrative regulations, court rules, government policies,\ncommon law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are\ngranted to and imposed upon spouses.” Cal. Stats. 2003, ch.\n421, § 4 (codified at Cal. Fam. Code § 297.5(a)). It withheld\nonly the official designation of marriage and thus the offi-\ncially conferred and societally recognized status that accom-\npanies that designation.\n\n                                 B\n\n   In 2004, same-sex couples and the City and County of San\nFrancisco filed actions in California state courts alleging that\nthe State’s marriage statutes violated the California Constitu-\ntion. Proposition 22 was among the statutes challenged,\n\f1592                         PERRY v. BROWN\nbecause as an initiative statutory enactment, it was equal in\ndignity to an enactment by the Legislature and thus subject to\nthe restrictions of the state constitution.1 The consolidated\ncases were eventually decided by the California Supreme\nCourt, which held the statutes to be unconstitutional, for two\nindependent reasons.\n\n   First, the court held that the fundamental right to marry\nprovided by the California Constitution could not be denied\nto same-sex couples, who are guaranteed “the same substan-\ntive constitutional rights as opposite-sex couples to choose\none’s life partner and enter with that person into a committed,\nofficially recognized, and protected family relationship that\nenjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage.”\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 433-34. The court began by reaf-\nfirming that “the right to marry is an integral component of\nan individual’s interest in personal autonomy protected by the\nprivacy provision of article I, section 1 [of the California Con-\nstitution], and of the liberty interest protected by the due pro-\ncess clause of article I, section 7.” Id. at 426 (emphasis\nomitted). It then held “that an individual’s homosexual orien-\ntation is not a constitutionally legitimate basis for withholding\nor restricting the individual’s legal rights.” Id. at 429. The\ncourt acknowledged that although such an inclusive under-\nstanding of the right to marry was one that had developed\nonly “in recent decades,” as the State extended greater recog-\nnition to same-sex couples and households, it was “apparent\nthat history alone does not provide a justification for interpret-\n  1\n    The California Constitution differentiates between initiative statutes,\nwhich require petitions signed by five percent of electors, and initiative\nconstitutional amendments, which require petitions signed by eight per-\ncent of electors. Cal. Const. art. 2, § 8(b). An initiative statutory enactment\nhas somewhat greater status than a statute adopted by the Legislature, in\nthat the Legislature may not amend or repeal the initiative statute without\nsubmitting the change to approval by the electors (unless the initiative\nstatute provides otherwise). Id. § 10(c). Yet, like a statutory enactment by\nthe Legislature, and unlike an initiative constitutional amendment, it is\nsubject to the terms of the state constitution.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1593\ning the constitutional right to marry as protecting only one’s\nability to enter into an officially recognized family relation-\nship with a person of the opposite sex,” because\n“ ‘[f]undamental rights, once recognized, cannot be denied to\nparticular groups on the ground that these groups have histori-\ncally been denied those rights.’ ” Id. at 428-30 (quoting Her-\nnandez v. Robles, 7 N.Y.3d 338, 381 (2006) (Kaye, C.J.,\ndissenting)).\n\n   The court concluded its due process analysis by rejecting\nthe argument that the availability of domestic partnerships sat-\nisfied “all of the personal and dignity interests that have tradi-\ntionally informed the right to marry,” because “[t]he current\nstatutes—by drawing a distinction between the name assigned\nto the family relationship available to opposite-sex couples\nand the name assigned to the family relationship available to\nsame-sex couples, and by reserving the historic and highly\nrespected designation of ‘marriage’ exclusively to opposite-\nsex couples while offering same-sex couples only the new and\nunfamiliar designation of domestic partnership—pose a seri-\nous risk of denying the official family relationship of same-\nsex couples the equal dignity and respect that is a core ele-\nment of the constitutional right to marry.” Id. at 434-35.\n\n   Second, the court held that “[t]he current statutory assign-\nment of different names for the official family relationships of\nopposite-sex couples on the one hand, and of same-sex cou-\nples on the other” violated the equal protection clause in arti-\ncle I, section 7 of the California Constitution. Id. at 435, 452-\n53. The court determined that the State had no interest in\nreserving the name ‘marriage’ for opposite-sex couples; “the\nhistoric and well-established nature of this limitation” could\nnot itself justify the differential treatment, and the court found\nno reason that restricting the designation of ‘marriage’ to\nopposite-sex couples was necessary to preserve the benefits of\nmarriage enjoyed by opposite-sex couples or their children.\nId. at 450-52. The court noted specifically that “the distinction\nin nomenclature between marriage and domestic partnership\n\f1594                    PERRY v. BROWN\ncannot be defended on the basis of an asserted difference in\nthe effect on children of being raised by an opposite-sex cou-\nple instead of by a same-sex couple,” because “the governing\nCalifornia statutes permit same-sex couples to adopt and raise\nchildren and additionally draw no distinction between married\ncouples and domestic partners with regard to the legal rights\nand responsibilities relating to children raised within each of\nthese family relationships.” Id. at 452 n.72. Restricting access\nto the designation of ‘marriage’ did, however, “work[ ] a real\nand appreciable harm upon same-sex couples and their chil-\ndren,” because “providing only a novel, alternative institution\nfor same-sex couples” constituted “an official statement that\nthe family relationship of same-sex couples is not of compara-\nble stature or equal dignity to the family relationship of\nopposite-sex couples.” Id. at 452. Consequently, the court\ndetermined that withholding only the name ‘marriage’ from\nsame-sex couples violated the California Constitution’s guar-\nantee of equal protection.\n\n   The court remedied these constitutional violations by strik-\ning the language from the marriage statutes “limiting the des-\nignation of marriage to a union ‘between a man and a\nwoman,’ ” invalidating Proposition 22, and ordering that the\ndesignation of ‘marriage’ be made available to both opposite-\nsex and same-sex couples. Id. at 453. Following the court’s\ndecision, California counties issued more than 18,000 mar-\nriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n                               C\n\n   Five      California      residents—defendants-intervenors-\nappellants Dennis Hollingsworth, Gail J. Knight, Martin F.\nGutierrez, Hak-Shing William Tam, and Mark A. Jansson\n(collectively, “Proponents”)—collected voter signatures and\nfiled petitions with the state government to place an initiative\non the November 4, 2008, ballot. Unlike Proposition 22, this\nwas an initiative constitutional amendment, which would be\nequal in effect to any other provision of the California Consti-\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1595\ntution, rather than subordinate to it. The Proponents’ measure,\ndesignated Proposition 8, proposed to add a new provision to\nthe California Constitution’s Declaration of Rights, immedi-\nately following the Constitution’s due process and equal pro-\ntection clauses. The provision states, “Only marriage between\na man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.”\nAccording to the official voter information guide, Proposition\n8 “[c]hanges the California Constitution to eliminate the right\nof same-sex couples to marry in California.” Official Voter\nInformation Guide, California General Election (Nov. 4,\n2008), at 54. Following a contentious campaign, a slim major-\nity of California voters (52.3 percent) approved Proposition 8.\nPursuant to the state constitution, Proposition 8 took effect the\nnext day, as article I, section 7.5 of the California Constitu-\ntion.\n\n   Opponents of Proposition 8 then brought an original action\nfor a writ of mandate in the California Supreme Court. They\ncontended that Proposition 8 exceeded the scope of the Peo-\nple’s initiative power because it revised, rather than amended,\nthe California Constitution. The opponents did not raise any\nfederal constitutional challenge to Proposition 8 in the state\ncourt. The state officials named as respondents refused to\ndefend the measure’s validity, but Proponents were permitted\nto intervene and do so. Following argument, the court upheld\nProposition 8 as a valid initiative but construed the measure\nas not nullifying the 18,000-plus marriages of same-sex cou-\nples that had already been performed in the State. Strauss v.\nHorton, 207 P.3d 48, 98-110, 119-22 (Cal. 2009).\n\n   The court also explained Proposition 8’s precise effect on\nCalifornia law: “[T]he measure carves out a narrow and lim-\nited exception to the[ ] state constitutional rights [articulated\nin the Marriage Cases], reserving the official designation of\nthe term ‘marriage’ for the union of opposite-sex couples as\na matter of state constitutional law, but leaving undisturbed all\nof the other extremely significant substantive aspects of a\nsame-sex couple’s state constitutional right to establish an\n\f1596                       PERRY v. BROWN\nofficially recognized and protected family relationship and the\nguarantee of equal protection of the laws.” Id. at 61; see also\nid. at 75. In other words, after Proposition 8, “[s]ame-sex cou-\nples retain all of the fundamental substantive components\nencompassed within the constitutional rights of privacy and\ndue process, with the sole (albeit significant) exception of the\nright to equal access to the designation ‘marriage.’ ” Id. at\n116. Proposition 8 accomplished this result not by “declar-\n[ing] the state of the law as it existed when the Marriage\nCases decision was rendered, but instead [by] establish[ing]\na new substantive state constitutional rule that became effec-\ntive once Proposition 8 was approved by the voters.” Id. at\n115; see also id. at 63.\n\n                                   II\n\n                                   A\n\n   Two same-sex couples—plaintiffs Kristin Perry and Sandra\nStier, and Paul Katami and Jeffrey Zarrillo—filed this action\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in May 2009, after being denied mar-\nriage licenses by the County Clerks of Alameda County and\nLos Angeles County, respectively. Alleging that Proposition\n8 violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, they sought a declaration of its unconstitutional-\nity and an injunction barring its enforcement. The City and\nCounty of San Francisco (“San Francisco”) was later permit-\nted to intervene as a plaintiff to present evidence of the\namendment’s effects on its governmental interests. The\ndefendants—the two county clerks and four state officers,\nincluding the Governor and Attorney General—filed answers\nto the complaint but once again refused to argue in favor of\nProposition 8’s constitutionality. As a result, the district court\ngranted Proponents’ motion to intervene as of right under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) to defend the validity\nof the proposition they had sponsored.2\n  2\n   The district court subsequently denied the motion to intervene brought\nby the Campaign for California Families, a public interest organization\n\f                             PERRY v. BROWN                             1597\n   The district court held a twelve-day bench trial, during\nwhich it heard testimony from nineteen witnesses and, after\ngiving the parties a full and fair opportunity to present evi-\ndence and argument, built an extensive evidentiary record.3 In\na thorough opinion in August 2010, the court made eighty\nfindings of fact and adopted the relevant conclusions of law.\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger (Perry IV), 704 F. Supp. 2d 921\n(N.D. Cal. 2010).4 The court held Proposition 8 unconstitu-\n\nthat supported Proposition 8 but was not the measure’s official sponsor.\nWe affirmed that decision in Perry v. Proposition 8 Official Proponents\n(Perry I), 587 F.3d 947 (9th Cir. 2009). The district court also denied\nleave to intervene to a coalition of civil rights advocacy organizations. Id.\nat 950 n.1.\n   3\n     A number of ancillary matters, none of which we need revisit here,\nwere presented to this court immediately prior to and during the trial. First,\nwe granted Proponents’ petition for a writ of mandamus to protect their\nFirst Amendment interests in campaign communications against intrusion\nby Plaintiffs’ discovery requests. Perry v. Schwarzenegger (Perry II), 591\nF.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2010), amending and denying reh’g en banc of 591\nF.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2009). Second, we denied a similar mandamus petition\nbrought by three non-party organizations that had campaigned against\nProposition 8. Perry v. Schwarzenegger (Perry III), 602 F.3d 976 (9th Cir.\n2010). Finally, a motions panel of this court denied Proponents’ emer-\ngency petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on the eve of trial, to prohibit\nthe district court from broadcasting the trial via streaming video and audio\nto a few federal courthouses around the country. The Supreme Court then\ngranted Proponents’ application for a temporary and eventually permanent\nstay of the broadcast. Hollingsworth v. Perry, 130 S. Ct. 1132 (2010)\n(mem.); Hollingsworth v. Perry, 130 S. Ct. 705 (2010).\n   4\n     The court found, among other things, that (1) marriage benefits society\nby organizing individuals into cohesive family units, developing a realm\nof liberty for intimacy and free decision making, creating stable house-\nholds, legitimating children, assigning individuals to care for one another,\nand facilitating property ownership, id. at 961; (2) marriage benefits\nspouses and their children physically, psychologically, and economically,\nid. at 962-63, whether the spouses are of the same or opposite sexes, id.\nat 969-70; (3) domestic partnerships lack the social meaning associated\nwith marriage, id. at 970, 973-75; (4) permitting same-sex couples to\nmarry would not affect the number or stability of opposite-sex marriages,\nid. at 972-73; (5) the children of same-sex couples benefit when their par-\n\f1598                         PERRY v. BROWN\ntional under the Due Process Clause because no compelling\nstate interest justifies denying same-sex couples the funda-\nmental right to marry. Id. at 991-95. The court also deter-\nmined that Proposition 8 violated the Equal Protection Clause,\nbecause there is no rational basis for limiting the designation\nof ‘marriage’ to opposite-sex couples. Id. at 997-1003. The\ncourt therefore entered the following injunction: “Defendants\nin their official capacities, and all persons under the control\nor supervision of defendants, are permanently enjoined from\napplying or enforcing Article I, § 7.5 of the California Constitu-\ntion.”5 Doc. 728 (Permanent Injunction), Perry v. Schwar-\nzenegger, No. 09-cv-02292 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2010).6\n\n                                      B\n\n   Proponents appealed immediately, and a motions panel of\nthis court stayed the district court’s injunction pending appeal.\n\nents marry, and they fare just as well as children raised by opposite-sex\nparents, id. at 973, 980-81; (6) Proposition 8 stigmatizes same-sex couples\nas having relationships inferior to those of opposite-sex couples, id. at\n973-74, 979-80; (7) Proposition 8 eliminated same-sex couples’ right to\nmarry but did not affect any other substantive right they enjoyed, id. at\n977; and (8) the campaign in favor of Proposition 8 relied upon stereo-\ntypes and unfounded fears about gays and lesbians, id. at 988-91.\n   5\n     Without explanation, the district court failed to enter a separate declar-\natory judgment as Plaintiffs had requested. The court’s opinion made clear\nits holding “that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional.” 704 F. Supp. 2d at\n1003. But the clerk apparently never issued this declaratory judgment as\na separate document, as Fed. R. Civ. P. 58 requires.\n   6\n     Concurrently with its decision on the merits of Plaintiffs’ claim, the\ndistrict court denied a motion to intervene as a defendant brought by Impe-\nrial County, its board of supervisors, and one of its Deputy County Clerks.\nWe affirmed the district court’s denial of the motion, on alternative\ngrounds, in Perry v. Schwarzenegger (Perry VI), 630 F.3d 898 (9th Cir.\n2011). The newly elected County Clerk of Imperial County subsequently\nmoved to intervene in this court in the companion appeal, No. 10-16751.\nIn light of the fact that Proponents have standing to appeal, we deny the\nmotion as untimely but have considered the Clerk’s filings as briefs amici\ncuriae.\n\f                           PERRY v. BROWN                          1599\nThe motions panel asked the parties to discuss in their briefs,\nas a preliminary matter, whether the Proponents had standing\nto seek review of the district court order. After considering\nthe parties’ arguments, we concluded that Proponents’ stand-\ning to appeal depended on the precise rights and interests\ngiven to official sponsors of an initiative under California law,\nwhich had never been clearly defined by the State’s highest\ncourt. We therefore certified the following question to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court:\n\n      Whether under Article II, Section 8 of the California\n      Constitution, or otherwise under California law, the\n      official proponents of an initiative measure possess\n      either a particularized interest in the initiative’s\n      validity or the authority to assert the State’s interest\n      in the initiative’s validity, which would enable them\n      to defend the constitutionality of the initiative upon\n      its adoption or appeal a judgment invalidating the\n      initiative, when the public officials charged with that\n      duty refuse to do so.\n\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger (Perry V), 628 F.3d 1191, 1193 (9th\nCir. 2011). The state court granted our request for certifica-\ntion in February 2011, and in November 2011 rendered its\ndecision. See Perry v. Brown (Perry VII), 134 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n499( 2011). We now resume consideration of this appeal.7\n\n                                  III\n\n  We begin, as we must, with the issue that has prolonged\nour consideration of this case: whether we have jurisdiction\nover an appeal brought by the defendant-intervenor Propo-\nnents, rather than the defendant state and local officers who\nwere directly enjoined by the district court order.8 In view of\n  7\n    We vacated submission of this case upon ordering that our question be\ncertified to the California Supreme Court. Perry V, 628 F.3d at 1200. The\ncase is now ordered resubmitted.\n  8\n    Although we regret the delay that our need to resolve this issue has\ncaused, we note that this delay was not of our own making. See Perry V,\n\f1600                       PERRY v. BROWN\nProponents’ authority under California law, we conclude that\nthey do have standing to appeal.\n\n   For purposes of Article III standing, we start with the prem-\nise that “a State has standing to defend the constitutionality of\nits [laws].” Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 62 (1986).\nWhen a state law is ruled unconstitutional, either the state or\na state officer charged with the law’s enforcement may appeal\nthat determination. Typically, the named defendant in an\naction challenging the constitutionality of a state law is a state\nofficer, because sovereign immunity protects the state from\nbeing sued directly. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 157-\n58 (1908); L.A. County Bar Ass’n v. Eu, 979 F.2d 697, 704\n(9th Cir. 1992). In such cases, if a court invalidates the state\nlaw and enjoins its enforcement, there is no question that the\nstate officer is entitled to appeal that determination. See, e.g.,\nYsursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass’n, 555 U.S. 353 (2009) (Idaho\nSecretary of State and Attorney General appealed decision\nstriking down an Idaho law on First Amendment grounds);\nStenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000) (Nebraska Attorney\nGeneral appealed decision holding unconstitutional a\nNebraska abortion law). Moreover, there is no reason that a\nstate itself may not also choose to intervene as a defendant,\nand indeed a state must be permitted to intervene if a state\nofficer is not already party to an action in which the constitu-\ntionality of a state law is challenged. See 28 U.S.C. § 2403(b);\nFed. R. Civ. P. 5.1; cf. Fed. R. App. P. 44(b). When a state\ndoes elect to become a defendant itself, the state may appeal\nan adverse decision about the constitutionality of one of its\nlaws, just as a state officer may. See, e.g., Caruso v. Yamhill\nCounty ex rel. County Comm’r, 422 F.3d 848, 852-53 & n.2\n(9th Cir. 2005) (sole appellant was the State of Oregon, which\nhad intervened as a defendant in the district court). In other\n\n628 F.3d at 1200-02 (Reinhardt, J., concurring). We are grateful to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court for the thoughtful and full consideration it gave\nour question.\n\f                           PERRY v. BROWN                          1601\nwords, in a suit for an injunction against enforcement of an\nallegedly unconstitutional state law, it makes no practical dif-\nference whether the formal party before the court is the state\nitself or a state officer in his official capacity. Cf. Pennhurst\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 114 n.25\n(1984) (discussing the “fiction” of Ex parte Young); see also\nIdaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 269-70\n(1997) (same).\n\n   Whether the defendant is the state or a state officer, the\ndecision to assert the state’s own interest in the constitutional-\nity of its laws is most commonly made by the state’s execu-\ntive branch—the part of state government that is usually\ncharged with enforcing and defending state law. See, e.g.,\nYsursa, 555 U.S. at 354 (Idaho state officers represented by\nstate Attorney General); Caruso, 422 F.3d at 851 (State of\nOregon represented by Oregon Department of Justice). Some\nsovereigns vest the authority to assert their interest in litiga-\ntion exclusively in certain executive officers. See, e.g., 28\nU.S.C. §§ 516-19; 28 C.F.R. § 0.20.\n\n   The states need not follow that approach, however. It is\ntheir prerogative, as independent sovereigns, to decide for\nthemselves who may assert their interests and under what cir-\ncumstances, and to bestow that authority accordingly. In Kar-\ncher v. May, 484 U.S. 72 (1987), for example, the Supreme\nCourt held that the State of New Jersey was properly repre-\nsented in litigation by the Speaker of the General Assembly\nand the President of the Senate, appearing on behalf of the\nLegislature, because “the New Jersey Legislature had author-\nity under state law to represent the State’s interests.” Id. at 82\n(citing In re Forsythe, 450 A.2d 499, 500 (N.J. 1982)).9 Prin-\n  9\n    See also Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974), in which a county\nclerk was not barred from appealing a judgment invalidating California’s\nfelon disenfranchisement law, even though the only state officer who had\nbeen sued, then-California Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown, Jr.,\nrefused to pursue the appeal. Id. at 26 n.1, 36-38.\n\f1602                     PERRY v. BROWN\nciples of federalism require that federal courts respect such\ndecisions by the states as to who may speak for them: “there\nare limits on the Federal Government’s power to affect the\ninternal operations of a State.” Va. Office for Protection &\nAdvocacy v. Stewart, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 1641 (2011). It is not\nfor a federal court to tell a state who may appear on its behalf\nany more than it is for Congress to direct state law-\nenforcement officers to administer a federal regulatory\nscheme, see Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), to\ncommand a state to take ownership of waste generated within\nits borders, see New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144\n(1992), or to dictate where a state shall locate its capital, see\nCoyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559 (1911). Who may speak for the\nstate is, necessarily, a question of state law. All a federal court\nneed determine is that the state has suffered a harm sufficient\nto confer standing and that the party seeking to invoke the\njurisdiction of the court is authorized by the state to represent\nits interest in remedying that harm.\n\n   Proponents claim to assert the interest of the People of Cal-\nifornia in the constitutionality of Proposition 8, which the\nPeople themselves enacted. When faced with a case arising in\na similar posture, in which an Arizona initiative constitutional\namendment was defended only by its sponsors, the Supreme\nCourt expressed “grave doubts” about the sponsors’ standing\ngiven that the Court was “aware of no Arizona law appointing\ninitiative sponsors as agents of the people of Arizona to\ndefend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of ini-\ntiatives made law of the State.” Arizonans for Official English\nv. Arizona (Arizonans), 520 U.S. 43, 65-66 (1997). Absent\nsome conferral of authority by state law, akin to the authority\nthat the New Jersey legislators in Karcher had as “elected rep-\nresentatives,” the Court suggested that proponents of a ballot\nmeasure would not be able to appeal a decision striking down\nthe initiative they sponsored. Id. at 65.\n\n  [1] Here, unlike in Arizonans, we do know that California\nlaw confers on “initiative sponsors” the authority “to defend,\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                        1603\nin lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initiatives\nmade law of the State.” The California Supreme Court has\ntold us, in a published opinion containing an exhaustive\nreview of the California Constitution and statutes, that it does.\nIn answering our certified question, the court held\n\n    that when the public officials who ordinarily defend\n    a challenged state law or appeal a judgment invali-\n    dating the law decline to do so, under article II, sec-\n    tion 8 of the California Constitution and the relevant\n    provisions of the Elections Code, the official propo-\n    nents of a voter-approved initiative measure are\n    authorized to assert the state’s interest in the initia-\n    tive’s validity, enabling the proponents to defend the\n    constitutionality of the initiative and to appeal a\n    judgment invalidating the initiative.\n\nPerry VII, 134 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 536-37. “[T]he role played by\nthe proponents in such litigation,” the court explained, “is\ncomparable to the role ordinarily played by the Attorney Gen-\neral or other public officials in vigorously defending a duly\nenacted state law and raising all arguable legal theories upon\nwhich a challenged provision may be sustained.” Id. at 525.\nThe State’s highest court thus held that California law pro-\nvides precisely what the Arizonans Court found lacking in\nArizona law: it confers on the official proponents of an initia-\ntive the authority to assert the State’s interests in defending\nthe constitutionality of that initiative, where the state officials\nwho would ordinarily assume that responsibility choose not to\ndo so.\n\n   We are bound to accept the California court’s determina-\ntion. Although other states may act differently, California’s\nconferral upon proponents of the authority to represent the\nPeople’s interest in the initiative measure they sponsored is\nconsistent with that state’s unparalleled commitment to the\nauthority of the electorate: “No other state in the nation car-\nries the concept of initiatives as ‘written in stone’ to such\n\f1604                    PERRY v. BROWN\nlengths as” does California. People v. Kelly, 222 P.3d 186,\n200 (Cal. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed,\nCalifornia defines the initiative power as “one of the most\nprecious rights of our democratic process,” and considers “the\nsovereign people’s initiative power” to be a “fundamental\nright” under the state constitution. Assoc. Home Builders v.\nCity of Livermore, 557 P.2d 473, 477 (Cal. 1976); Brosnahan\nv. Brown, 651 P.2d 274, 277 (Cal. 1982); Costa v. Super. Ct.,\n128 P.3d 675, 686 (Cal. 2006). As the California Supreme\nCourt explained in answering our certified question, “[t]he\ninitiative power would be significantly impaired if there were\nno one to assert the state’s interest in the validity of the mea-\nsure when elected officials decline to defend it in court or to\nappeal a judgment invalidating the measure.” Perry VII, 134\nCal. Rptr. 3d at 523. The authority of official proponents to\n“assert[ ] the state’s interest in the validity of an initiative\nmeasure” thus “serves to safeguard the unique elements and\nintegrity of the initiative process.” Id. at 533.\n\n   It matters not whether federal courts think it wise or desir-\nable for California to afford proponents this authority to speak\nfor the State, just as it makes no difference whether federal\ncourts think it a good idea that California allows its constitu-\ntion to be amended by a majority vote through a ballot mea-\nsure in the first place. Cf. Pac. States Tel. & Tel. Co. v.\nOregon, 223 U.S. 118 (1912) (holding nonjusticiable a Guar-\nanty Clause challenge to Oregon’s initiative system). The\nPeople of California are largely free to structure their system\nof governance as they choose, and we respect their choice. All\nthat matters, for federal standing purposes, is that the People\nhave an interest in the validity of Proposition 8 and that, under\nCalifornia law, Proponents are authorized to represent the\nPeople’s interest. That is the case here.\n\n   In their supplemental brief on the issue of standing, Plain-\ntiffs argue for the first time that Proponents must satisfy the\nrequirements of third-party standing in order to assert the\ninterests of the State of California in this litigation. Litigants\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                        1605\nwho wish “to bring actions on behalf of third parties” must\nsatisfy three requirements. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400,\n410-11 (1991). First, they “must have suffered an ‘injury in\nfact,’ thus giving [them] a ‘sufficiently concrete interest’ in\nthe outcome of the issue in dispute.” Id. at 411. Second, they\n“must have a close relation to the third party.” Id. Third,\n“there must exist some hindrance to the third party’s ability\nto protect his or her own interests.” Id. Plaintiffs contend that\nProponents cannot satisfy these requirements with respect to\nthe State of California as a third party.\n\n    The requirements of third-party standing, however, are\nbeside the point: the State of California is no more a “third\nparty” relative to Proponents than it is to the executive offi-\ncers of the State who ordinarily assert the State’s interest in\nlitigation. As the California Supreme Court has explained,\n“the role played by the proponents” in litigation “regarding\nthe validity or proper interpretation of a voter-approved initia-\ntive measure . . . is comparable to the role ordinarily played\nby the Attorney General or other public officials in vigorously\ndefending a duly enacted state law.” Perry VII, 134 Cal. Rptr.\n3d at 525. When the Attorney General of California appears\nin federal court to defend the validity of a state statute, she\nobviously need not satisfy the requirements of third-party\nstanding; she stands in the shoes of the State to assert its inter-\nests in litigation. For the purposes of the litigation, she speaks\nto the court as the State, not as a third party. The same is true\nof Proponents here, just as it was true of the presiding legisla-\ntive officers in Karcher, 484 U.S. at 82. The requirements of\nthird-party standing are therefore not relevant.\n\n   [2] Nor is it relevant whether Proponents have suffered a\npersonal injury, in their capacities as private individuals.\nAlthough we asked the California Supreme Court whether\n“the official proponents of an initiative measure possess either\na particularized interest in the initiative’s validity or the\nauthority to assert the State’s interest in the initiative’s validi-\nty,” Perry V, 628 F.3d at 1193 (emphasis added), the Court\n\f1606                         PERRY v. BROWN\nchose to address only the latter type of interest. Perry VII, 134\nCal. Rptr. 3d at 515 (“Because [our] conclusion [that propo-\nnents are authorized to assert the State’s interest] is sufficient\nto support an affirmative response to the question posed by\nthe Ninth Circuit, we need not decide whether, under Califor-\nnia law, the official proponents also possess a particularized\ninterest in a voter-approved initiative’s validity.”). The exclu-\nsive basis of our holding that Proponents possess Article III\nstanding is their authority to assert the interests of the State\nof California, rather than any authority that they might have\nto assert particularized interests of their own. Just as the\nAttorney General of California need not satisfy the require-\nments of third-party standing when she appears in federal\ncourt to defend the validity of a state statute, she obviously\nneed not show that she would suffer any personal injury as a\nresult of the statute’s invalidity. The injury of which she com-\nplains is the State’s, not her own. The same is true here.\nBecause “a State has standing to defend the constitutionality\nof its [laws],” Diamond, 476 U.S. at 62, Proponents need not\nshow that they would suffer any personal injury from the\ninvalidation of Proposition 8. That the State would suffer an\ninjury, id., is enough for Proponents to have Article III stand-\ning when state law authorizes them to assert the State’s inter-\nests.\n\n   To be clear, we do not suggest that state law has any\n“power directly to enlarge or contract federal jurisdiction.”\nDuchek v. Jacobi, 646 F.2d 415, 419 (9th Cir. 1981). “Stand-\ning to sue in any Article III court is, of course, a federal ques-\ntion which does not depend on the party’s . . . standing in state\ncourt.” Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 804\n(1985). State courts may afford litigants standing to appear\nwhere federal courts would not,10 but whether they do so has\nno bearing on the parties’ Article III standing in federal court.\n  10\n      Cf. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 113 (1983) (“[T]he\nstate courts need not impose the same standing or remedial requirements\nthat govern federal-court proceedings. The individual States may permit\ntheir courts to use injunctions to oversee the conduct of law enforcement\nauthorities on a continuing basis. But this is not the role of a federal court\n. . . .”).\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                        1607\n   [3] State law does have the power, however, to answer\nquestions antecedent to determining federal standing, such as\nthe one here: who is authorized to assert the People’s interest\nin the constitutionality of an initiative measure? Because the\nState of California has Article III standing to defend the con-\nstitutionality of Proposition 8, and because both the California\nConstitution and California law authorize “the official propo-\nnents of [an] initiative . . . to appear and assert the state’s\ninterest in the initiative’s validity and to appeal a judgment\ninvalidating the measure when the public officials who ordi-\nnarily defend the measure or appeal such a judgment decline\nto do so,” Perry VII, 134 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 505, we conclude\nthat Proponents are proper appellants here. They possess Arti-\ncle III standing to prosecute this appeal from the district\ncourt’s judgment invalidating Proposition 8.\n\n                                IV\n\n   We review the district court’s decision to grant a permanent\ninjunction for abuse of discretion, but we review the determi-\nnations underlying that decision by the standard that applies\nto each determination. Accordingly, we review the court’s\nconclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear\nerror. See Ting v. AT&T, 319 F.3d 1126, 1134-35 (9th Cir.\n2003); Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n\n   Plaintiffs and Proponents dispute whether the district\ncourt’s findings of fact concern the types of “facts”—so-\ncalled “adjudicative facts”—that are capable of being “found”\nby a court through the clash of proofs presented in adjudica-\ntion, as opposed to “legislative facts,” which are generally not\ncapable of being found in that fashion. “Adjudicative facts are\nfacts about the parties and their activities . . . , usually answer-\ning the questions of who did what, where, when, how, why,\nwith what motive or intent”—the types of “facts that go to a\njury in a jury case,” or to the factfinder in a bench trial. Mar-\nshall v. Sawyer, 365 F.2d 105, 111 (9th Cir. 1966) (quoting\nKenneth Culp Davis, The Requirement of a Trial-Type Hear-\n\f1608                    PERRY v. BROWN\ning, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 199 (1956)) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “Legislative facts,” by contrast, “do not usu-\nally concern [only] the immediate parties but are general facts\nwhich help the tribunal decide questions of law, policy, and\ndiscretion.” Id.\n\n   It is debatable whether some of the district court’s findings\nof fact concerning matters of history or social science are\nmore appropriately characterized as “legislative facts” or as\n“adjudicative facts.” We need not resolve what standard of\nreview should apply to any such findings, however, because\nthe only findings to which we give any deferential weight—\nthose concerning the messages in support of Proposition 8\nthat Proponents communicated to the voters to encourage\ntheir approval of the measure, Perry IV, 704 F. Supp. 2d at\n990-91—are clearly “adjudicative facts” concerning the par-\nties and “ ‘who did what, where, when, how, why, with what\nmotive or intent.’ ” Marshall, 365 F.2d at 111. Aside from\nthese findings, the only fact found by the district court that\nmatters to our analysis is that “[d]omestic partnerships lack\nthe social meaning associated with marriage”—that the differ-\nence between the designation of ‘marriage’ and the designa-\ntion of ‘domestic partnership’ is meaningful. Perry IV, 704 F.\nSupp. 2d at 970. This fact was conceded by Proponents during\ndiscovery. Defendant-Intervenors’ Response to Plaintiffs’\nFirst Set of Requests for Admission, Exhibit No. PX 0707, at\n2 (“Proponents admit that the word ‘marriage’ has a unique\nmeaning.”); id. at 11 (Proponents “[a]dmit that there is a sig-\nnificant symbolic disparity between domestic partnership and\nmarriage”). Our analysis therefore does not hinge on what\nstandard we use to review the district court’s findings of fact.\nCf. Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 168 n.3 (1986)\n(“Because we do not ultimately base our decision today on the\n[validity or] invalidity of the lower courts’ ‘factual’ findings,\nwe need not decide the ‘standard of review’ issue”—whether\n“the ‘clearly erroneous’ standard of Rule 52(a) applies to the\nkind of ‘legislative’ facts at issue here.”).\n\f                       PERRY v. BROWN                     1609\n                              V\n\n   We now turn to the merits of Proposition 8’s constitutional-\nity.\n\n                              A\n\n   The district court held Proposition 8 unconstitutional for\ntwo reasons: first, it deprives same-sex couples of the funda-\nmental right to marry, which is guaranteed by the Due Process\nClause, see Perry IV, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 991-95; and second,\nit excludes same-sex couples from state-sponsored marriage\nwhile allowing opposite-sex couples access to that honored\nstatus, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, see id. at\n997-1003. Plaintiffs elaborate upon those arguments on\nappeal.\n\n   Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor San Francisco also offer\na third argument: Proposition 8 singles out same-sex couples\nfor unequal treatment by taking away from them alone the\nright to marry, and this action amounts to a distinct constitu-\ntional violation because the Equal Protection Clause protects\nminority groups from being targeted for the deprivation of an\nexisting right without a legitimate reason. Romer, 517 U.S. at\n634-35. Because this third argument applies to the specific\nhistory of same-sex marriage in California, it is the narrowest\nground for adjudicating the constitutional questions before us,\nwhile the first two theories, if correct, would apply on a\nbroader basis. Because courts generally decide constitutional\nquestions on the narrowest ground available, we consider the\nthird argument first. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514\nU.S. 211, 217 (1995) (citing Ashwander v. Tenn. Valley Auth.,\n297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)).\n\n                              B\n\n   [4] Proposition 8 worked a singular and limited change to\nthe California Constitution: it stripped same-sex couples of\n\f1610                        PERRY v. BROWN\nthe right to have their committed relationships recognized by\nthe State with the designation of ‘marriage,’ which the state\nconstitution had previously guaranteed them, while leaving in\nplace all of their other rights and responsibilities as partners—\nrights and responsibilities that are identical to those of mar-\nried spouses and form an integral part of the marriage rela-\ntionship. In determining that the law had this effect, “[w]e\nrely not upon our own interpretation of the amendment but\nupon the authoritative construction of [California’s] Supreme\nCourt.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 626. The state high court held in\nStrauss that “Proposition 8 reasonably must be interpreted in\na limited fashion as eliminating only the right of same-sex\ncouples to equal access to the designation of marriage, and as\nnot otherwise affecting the constitutional right of those cou-\nples to establish an officially recognized family relationship,”\nwhich California calls a ‘domestic partnership.’ 207 P.3d at\n76. Proposition 8 “leaves intact all of the other very signifi-\ncant constitutional protections afforded same-sex couples,”\nincluding “the constitutional right to enter into an officially\nrecognized and protected family relationship with the person\nof one’s choice and to raise children in that family if the cou-\nple so chooses.” Id. at 102. Thus, the extent of the amend-\nment’s effect was to “establish[ ] a new substantive state\nconstitutional rule,” id. at 63, which “carves out a narrow and\nlimited exception to these state constitutional rights,” by “re-\nserving the official designation of the term ‘marriage’ for the\nunion of opposite-sex couples as a matter of state constitu-\ntional law,” id. at 61.11\n  11\n     In rejecting the argument that Proposition 8 had impermissibly\nrevised, rather than amended, the state constitution, Strauss explained that\nit “drastically overstates the effect of Proposition 8 on the fundamental\nstate constitutional rights of same-sex couples” to suggest that the proposi-\ntion “ ‘eliminat[ed]’ or ‘stripp[ed]’ same-sex couples of a fundamental\nconstitutional right,” because the substantive protections of the state equal\nprotection clause and due process and privacy provisions remained intact\n—with the “sole, albeit significant, exception” of the right to use the des-\nignation of ‘marriage,’ which was eliminated for same-sex couples. 207\nP.3d at 102.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                        1611\n   Both before and after Proposition 8, same-sex partners\ncould enter into an official, state-recognized relationship that\naffords them “the same rights, protections, and benefits” as an\nopposite-sex union and subjects them “to the same responsi-\nbilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether they derive\nfrom statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, govern-\nment policies, common law, or any other provisions or\nsources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.”\nCal. Fam. Code § 297.5(a).

Proc. Code § 377.60—among many other\n        things.\n\nProposition 8 did not affect these rights or any of the other\n“ ‘constitutionally based incidents of marriage’ ” guaranteed\nto same-sex couples and their families. Strauss, 207 P.3d at\n61 (quoting Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 434). In adopting\nthe amendment, the People simply took the designation of\n‘marriage’ away from lifelong same-sex partnerships, and\nwith it the State’s authorization of that official status and the\nsocietal approval that comes with it.\n\n   By emphasizing Proposition 8’s limited effect, we do not\nmean to minimize the harm that this change in the law caused\nto same-sex couples and their families. To the contrary, we\nemphasize the extraordinary significance of the official desig-\nnation of ‘marriage.’ That designation is important because\n‘marriage’ is the name that society gives to the relationship\nthat matters most between two adults. A rose by any other\nname may smell as sweet, but to the couple desiring to enter\ninto a committed lifelong relationship, a marriage by the name\nof ‘registered domestic partnership’ does not. The word ‘mar-\nriage’ is singular in connoting “a harmony in living,” “a bilat-\neral loyalty,” and “a coming together for better or for worse,\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                     1613\nhopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being\nsacred.” Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965).\nAs Proponents have admitted, “the word ‘marriage’ has a\nunique meaning,” and “there is a significant symbolic dispar-\nity between domestic partnership and marriage.” It is the des-\nignation of ‘marriage’ itself that expresses validation, by the\nstate and the community, and that serves as a symbol, like a\nwedding ceremony or a wedding ring, of something pro-\nfoundly important. See id. at 971.\n\n   We need consider only the many ways in which we\nencounter the word ‘marriage’ in our daily lives and under-\nstand it, consciously or not, to convey a sense of significance.\nWe are regularly given forms to complete that ask us whether\nwe are “single” or “married.” Newspapers run announcements\nof births, deaths, and marriages. We are excited to see some-\none ask, “Will you marry me?”, whether on bended knee in\na restaurant or in text splashed across a stadium Jumbotron.\nCertainly it would not have the same effect to see “Will you\nenter into a registered domestic partnership with me?”.\nGroucho Marx’s one-liner, “Marriage is a wonderful institu-\ntion . . . but who wants to live in an institution?” would lack\nits punch if the word ‘marriage’ were replaced with the alter-\nnative phrase. So too with Shakespeare’s “A young man mar-\nried is a man that’s marr’d,” Lincoln’s “Marriage is neither\nheaven nor hell, it is simply purgatory,” and Sinatra’s “A man\ndoesn’t know what happiness is until he’s married. By then\nit’s too late.” We see tropes like “marrying for love” versus\n“marrying for money” played out again and again in our films\nand literature because of the recognized importance and per-\nmanence of the marriage relationship. Had Marilyn Monroe’s\nfilm been called How to Register a Domestic Partnership with\na Millionaire, it would not have conveyed the same meaning\nas did her famous movie, even though the underlying drama\nfor same-sex couples is no different. The name ‘marriage’ sig-\nnifies the unique recognition that society gives to harmonious,\nloyal, enduring, and intimate relationships. See Knight v.\nSuper. Ct., 128 Cal. App. 4th 14, 31 (2005) (“[M]arriage is\n\f1614                       PERRY v. BROWN\nconsidered a more substantial relationship and is accorded a\ngreater stature than a domestic partnership.”); cf. Griswold,\n381 U.S. at 486.\n\n   The official, cherished status of ‘marriage’ is distinct from\nthe incidents of marriage, such as those listed in the California\nFamily Code. The incidents are both elements of the institu-\ntion and manifestations of the recognition that the State\naffords to those who are in stable and committed lifelong rela-\ntionships. We allow spouses but not siblings or roommates to\nfile taxes jointly, for example, because we acknowledge the\nfinancial interdependence of those who have entered into an\n“enduring” relationship. The incidents of marriage, standing\nalone, do not, however, convey the same governmental and\nsocietal recognition as does the designation of ‘marriage’\nitself. We do not celebrate when two people merge their bank\naccounts; we celebrate when a couple marries. The designa-\ntion of ‘marriage’ is the status that we recognize. It is the\nprincipal manner in which the State attaches respect and dig-\nnity to the highest form of a committed relationship and to the\nindividuals who have entered into it.12\n\n   [5] We set this forth because we must evaluate Proposition\n8’s constitutionality in light of its actual and specific effects\non committed same-sex couples desiring to enter into an offi-\ncially recognized lifelong relationship. Before Proposition 8,\nCalifornia guaranteed gays and lesbians both the incidents and\nthe status and dignity of marriage. Proposition 8 left the inci-\ndents but took away the status and the dignity. It did so by\n  12\n     Cf. Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 434-35 (“[D]rawing a distinction\nbetween the name assigned to the family relationship available to\nopposite-sex couples and the name assigned to the family relationship\navailable to same-sex couples, and . . . reserving the historic and highly\nrespected designation of marriage exclusively to opposite-sex couples\nwhile offering same-sex couples only the new and unfamiliar designation\nof domestic partnership[,] pose[s] a serious risk of denying the official\nfamily relationship of same-sex couples the equal dignity and respect that\nis a core element of the constitutional right to marry.”).\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1615\nsuperseding the Marriage Cases and thus endorsing the “offi-\ncial statement that the family relationship of same-sex couples\nis not of comparable stature or equal dignity to the family\nrelationship of opposite-sex couples.” Marriage Cases, 183\nP.3d at 452. The question we therefore consider is this: did\nthe People of California have legitimate reasons for enacting\na constitutional amendment that serves only to take away\nfrom same-sex couples the right to have their lifelong rela-\ntionships dignified by the official status of ‘marriage,’ and to\ncompel the State and its officials and all others authorized to\nperform marriage ceremonies to substitute the label of\n‘domestic partnership’ for their relationships?\n\n   Proponents resist this framing of the question. They deem\nit irrelevant to our inquiry that the California Constitution, as\ninterpreted by the Marriage Cases, had previously guaranteed\nsame-sex couples the right to use the designation of ‘mar-\nriage,’ because In re Marriage Cases was a “short-lived deci-\nsion,” and same-sex couples were allowed to marry only\nduring a “143-day hiatus” between the effective date of the\nMarriage Cases decision and the enactment of Proposition 8.\nProponents’ Reply Br. 75, 79-80. According to Proponents, a\ndecision to “restore” the “traditional definition of marriage”\nis indistinguishable from a decision to “adhere” to that defini-\ntion in the first place. Id. at 79-80. We are bound, however,\nby the California Supreme Court’s authoritative interpretation\nof Proposition 8’s effect on California law, see Romer, 517\nU.S. at 626: Proposition 8 “eliminat[ed] . . . the right of same-\nsex couples to equal access to the designation of marriage” by\n“carv[ing] out a narrow and limited exception to these state\nconstitutional rights” that had previously guaranteed the des-\nignation of ‘marriage’ to all couples, opposite-sex and same-\nsex alike. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61, 76.\n\n   Even were we not bound by the state court’s explanation,\nwe would be obligated to consider Proposition 8 in light of its\nactual effect, which was, as the voters were told, to “eliminate\nthe right of same-sex couples to marry in California.” Voter\n\f1616                    PERRY v. BROWN\nInformation Guide at 54. The context matters. Withdrawing\nfrom a disfavored group the right to obtain a designation with\nsignificant societal consequences is different from declining\nto extend that designation in the first place, regardless of\nwhether the right was withdrawn after a week, a year, or a\ndecade. The action of changing something suggests a more\ndeliberate purpose than does the inaction of leaving it as it is.\nAs the California Supreme Court held, “Proposition 8 [did]\nnot ‘readjudicate’ the issue that was litigated and resolved in\nthe Marriage Cases.” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 63. Rather than\n“declar[ing] the state of the law as it existed under the Cali-\nfornia Constitution at the time of the Marriage Cases,” Propo-\nsition 8 “establishe[d] a new substantive state constitutional\nrule that took effect upon” its adoption by the electorate. Id.\n(emphasis added). Whether or not it is a historical accident,\nas Proponents argue, that Proposition 8 postdated the Mar-\nriage Cases rather than predating and thus preempting that\ndecision, the relative timing of the two events is a fact, and\nwe must decide this case on its facts.\n\n                               C\n\n                               1\n\n   This is not the first time the voters of a state have enacted\nan initiative constitutional amendment that reduces the rights\nof gays and lesbians under state law. In 1992, Colorado\nadopted Amendment 2 to its state constitution, which prohib-\nited the state and its political subdivisions from providing any\nprotection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orien-\ntation. See Colo. Const. art. II, § 30b. Amendment 2 was pro-\nposed in response to a number of local ordinances that had\nbanned sexual-orientation discrimination in such areas as\nhousing, employment, education, public accommodations,\nand health and welfare services. The effect of Amendment 2\nwas “to repeal” those local laws and “to prohibit any govern-\nmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective stat-\nutes, regulations, ordinances, or policies in the future.” Evans\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                            1617\nv. Romer, 854 P.2d 1270, 1284-85 (Colo. 1993). The law thus\n“withdr[ew] from homosexuals, but no others, specific legal\nprotection . . . , and it forb[ade] reinstatement of these laws\nand policies.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 627.\n\n   [6] The Supreme Court held that Amendment 2 violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause because “[i]t is not within our\nconstitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort”—laws that\n“singl[e] out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal\nstatus,” which “raise the inevitable inference that the disad-\nvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of per-\nsons affected.” Id. at 633-34. The Court considered possible\njustifications for Amendment 2 that might have overcome the\n“inference” of animus, but it found them all lacking. It there-\nfore concluded that the law “classifie[d] homosexuals not to\nfurther a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to\neveryone else.” Id. at 635.13\n\n   [7] Proposition 8 is remarkably similar to Amendment 2.\nLike Amendment 2, Proposition 8 “single[s] out a certain\nclass of citizens for disfavored legal status . . . .” Id. at 633.\nLike Amendment 2, Proposition 8 has the “peculiar property,”\nid. at 632, of “withdraw[ing] from homosexuals, but no oth-\ners,” an existing legal right—here, access to the official desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’—that had been broadly available,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the Constitution did not compel\nthe state to confer it in the first place. Id. at 627. Like Amend-\n   13\n      Romer did not apply heightened scrutiny to Amendment 2, even\nthough the amendment targeted gays and lesbians. Instead, Romer found\nthat Amendment 2 “fail[ed], indeed defie[d], even [the] conventional\ninquiry” for non-suspect classes, concerning whether a “legislative classi-\nfication . . . bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.” Romer, 517\nU.S. at 631-32. Amendment 2 amounted to “a classification of persons\nundertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does\nnot permit.” Id. at 635. We follow this approach and reach the same con-\nclusion as to Proposition 8. See also High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus.\nSec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 574 (9th Cir. 1990) (declining to\napply heightened scrutiny).\n\f1618                    PERRY v. BROWN\nment 2, Proposition 8 denies “equal protection of the laws in\nthe most literal sense,” id. at 633, because it “carves out” an\n“exception” to California’s equal protection clause, by remov-\ning equal access to marriage, which gays and lesbians had\npreviously enjoyed, from the scope of that constitutional guar-\nantee. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61. Like Amendment 2, Proposi-\ntion 8 “by state decree . . . put[s] [homosexuals] in a solitary\nclass with respect to” an important aspect of human relations,\nand accordingly “imposes a special disability upon [homosex-\nuals] alone.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 627, 631. And like Amend-\nment 2, Proposition 8 constitutionalizes that disability,\nmeaning that gays and lesbians may overcome it “only by\nenlisting the citizenry of [the state] to amend the State Consti-\ntution” for a second time. Id. at 631. As we explain below,\nRomer compels that we affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n   To be sure, there are some differences between Amend-\nment 2 and Proposition 8. Amendment 2 “impos[ed] a broad\nand undifferentiated disability on a single named group” by\n“identif[ying] persons by a single trait and then den[ying]\nthem protection across the board.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632-33.\nProposition 8, by contrast, excises with surgical precision one\nspecific right: the right to use the designation of ‘marriage’ to\ndescribe a couple’s officially recognized relationship. Propo-\nnents argue that Proposition 8 thus merely “restor[es] the tra-\nditional definition of marriage while otherwise leaving\nundisturbed the manifold rights and protections California law\nprovides gays and lesbians,” making it unlike Amendment 2,\nwhich eliminated various substantive rights. Proponents’\nReply Br. 77.\n\n  These differences, however, do not render Romer less\napplicable. It is no doubt true that the “special disability” that\nProposition 8 “imposes upon” gays and lesbians has a less\nsweeping effect on their public and private transactions than\ndid Amendment 2. Nevertheless, Proposition 8 works a mean-\ningful harm to gays and lesbians, by denying to their commit-\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                           1619\nted lifelong relationships the societal status conveyed by the\ndesignation of ‘marriage,’ and this harm must be justified by\nsome legitimate state interest. Romer, 517 U.S. at 631. Propo-\nsition 8 is no less problematic than Amendment 2 merely\nbecause its effect is narrower; to the contrary, the surgical\nprecision with which it excises a right belonging to gay and\nlesbian couples makes it even more suspect. A law that has no\npractical effect except to strip one group of the right to use a\nstate-authorized and socially meaningful designation is all the\nmore “unprecedented” and “unusual” than a law that imposes\nbroader changes, and raises an even stronger “inference that\nthe disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the\nclass of persons affected,” id. at 633-34. In short, Romer gov-\nerns our analysis notwithstanding the differences between\nAmendment 2 and Proposition 8.\n\n   [8] There is one further important similarity between this\ncase and Romer. Neither case requires that the voters have\nstripped the state’s gay and lesbian citizens of any federal\nconstitutional right. In Romer, Amendment 2 deprived gays\nand lesbians of statutory protections against discrimination;\nhere, Proposition 8 deprived same-sex partners of the right to\nuse the designation of ‘marriage.’ There is no necessity in\neither case that the privilege, benefit, or protection at issue be\na constitutional right. We therefore need not and do not con-\nsider whether same-sex couples have a fundamental right to\nmarry, or whether states that fail to afford the right to marry\nto gays and lesbians must do so. Further, we express no view\non those questions.14\n   14\n      Because we do not address the question of the constitutionality of a\nstate’s ban on same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court’s summary dismissal\nof Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972) (mem.), is not pertinent here.\n   In Baker, the Court “dismissed for want of a substantial federal ques-\ntion” an appeal from the Minnesota Supreme Court’s decision to uphold\na state statute that did not permit marriage between two people of the same\nsex. Id. Such dismissals “prevent lower courts from coming to opposite\nconclusions on the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by”\n\f1620                        PERRY v. BROWN\n   Ordinarily, “if a law neither burdens a fundamental right\nnor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative clas-\nsification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legiti-\nmate end.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 631. Such was the case in\nRomer, and it is the case here as well. The end must be one\nthat is legitimate for the government to pursue, not just one\nthat would be legitimate for a private actor. See id. at 632,\n635. The question here, then, is whether California had any\nmore legitimate justification for withdrawing from gays and\nlesbians its constitutional protection with respect to the offi-\ncial designation of ‘marriage’ than Colorado did for with-\ndrawing from that group all protection against discrimination\ngenerally.\n\n   Proposition 8, like Amendment 2, enacts a\n“ ‘[d]iscrimination[ ] of an unusual character,’ ” which\nrequires “ ‘careful consideration to determine whether [it] [is]\nobnoxious to the’ ” Constitution. Id. at 633 (quoting Louis-\nville Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U.S. 32, 37-38 (1928)).\nAs in Romer, therefore, we must consider whether any legiti-\n\nthem, Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173, 176 (1977) (per curiam), “ ‘except\nwhen doctrinal developments indicate otherwise,’ ” Hicks v. Miranda, 422\nU.S. 332, 344 (1975) (quoting Port Authority Bondholders Protective\nCommittee v. Port of New York Authority, 387 F.2d 259, 263 n.3 (2d Cir.\n1967)). “[N]o more may be read into” them, however, “than was essential\nto sustain th[e] judgment. Questions which ‘merely lurk in the record’ are\nnot resolved, and no resolution of them may be inferred.” Ill. State Bd. of\nElections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 183 (1979) (citations\nomitted).\n   Whether or not the constitutionality of any ban on same-sex marriage\nwas “presented and necessarily decided” in Baker, and whether or not\nBaker would govern that question in light of subsequent “doctrinal devel-\nopments,” we address no such question here. We address a wholly differ-\nent question: whether the people of a state may by plebiscite strip a group\nof a right or benefit, constitutional or otherwise, that they had previously\nenjoyed on terms of equality with all others in the state. That question was\nnot present in Baker and is squarely controlled by Romer, which postdates\nBaker by more than two decades.\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                           1621\nmate state interest constitutes a rational basis for Proposition\n8; otherwise, we must infer that it was enacted with only the\nconstitutionally illegitimate basis of “animus toward the class\nit affects.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632.\n\n                                    2\n\n   Before doing so, we briefly consider one other objection\nthat Proponents raise to this analysis: the argument that\nbecause the Constitution “is not simply a one-way ratchet that\nforever binds a State to laws and policies that go beyond what\nthe Fourteenth Amendment would otherwise require,” the\nState of California—“ ‘having gone beyond the requirements\nof the Federal Constitution’ ” in extending the right to marry\nto same-sex couples—“ ‘was free to return . . . to the standard\nprevailing generally throughout the United States.’ ” Propo-\nnents’ Reply Br. 76 (quoting Crawford v. Bd. of Educ., 458\nU.S. 527, 542 (1982)). Proponents appear to suggest that\nunless the Fourteenth Amendment actually requires that the\ndesignation of ‘marriage’ be given to same-sex couples in the\nfirst place, there can be no constitutional infirmity in taking\nthe designation away from that group of citizens, whatever the\nPeople’s reason for doing so.\n\n   [9] Romer forecloses this argument. The rights that were\nrepealed by Amendment 2 included protections against dis-\ncrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the private\nsphere. Those protections, like any protections against private\ndiscrimination, were not compelled by the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.15 Rather, “[s]tates ha[d] chosen to counter discrimina-\n  15\n     Indeed, as the Court observed, not only does the Fourteenth Amend-\nment not prohibit private discrimination; it does not even “give Congress\na general power to prohibit discrimination in public accommodations” by\nstatute. Romer, 517 U.S. at 628 (emphasis added) (citing Civil Rights\nCases, 109 U.S. 3, 25 (1883)). Congress has passed antidiscrimination\nlaws regulating private conduct only under its Article I powers. See, e.g.,\nHeart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964)\n(upholding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 under the Commerce Clause).\n\f1622                       PERRY v. BROWN\ntion by enacting detailed statutory schemes” prohibiting\ndiscrimination in employment and public accommodations,\namong other contexts, and certain Colorado jurisdictions had\nchosen to extend those protections to gays and lesbians.\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 628 (emphasis added). It was these elec-\ntive protections that Amendment 2 withdrew and forbade.16\nThe relevant inquiry in Romer was not whether the state of\nthe law after Amendment 2 was constitutional; there was no\ndoubt that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require\nantidiscrimination protections to be afforded to gays and les-\nbians. The question, instead, was whether the change in the\nlaw that Amendment 2 effected could be justified by some\nlegitimate purpose.\n\n   The Supreme Court’s answer was “no”—there was no\nlegitimate reason to take away broad legal protections from\ngays and lesbians alone, and to inscribe that deprivation of\nequality into the state constitution, once those protections had\nalready been provided. We therefore need not decide whether\na state may decline to provide the right to marry to same-sex\ncouples. To determine the validity of Proposition 8, we must\nconsider only whether the change in the law that it effected—\neliminating by constitutional amendment the right of same-\nsex couples to have the official designation and status of\n‘marriage’ bestowed upon their relationships, while maintain-\ning that right for opposite-sex couples—was justified by a\nlegitimate reason.\n\n   [10] This does not mean that the Constitution is a “one-\nway ratchet,” as Proponents suggest. It means only that the\nEqual Protection Clause requires the state to have a legitimate\nreason for withdrawing a right or benefit from one group but\n  16\n     The protections at issue in Romer were not of substantially more dis-\ntant provenance than the protection at issue here. While Aspen and Boul-\nder had enacted their ordinances somewhat earlier, Denver’s ordinance—\nwhich covered a far greater population—had taken effect only the year\nbefore Colorado voters adopted Amendment 2. Evans, 854 P.2d at 1284.\n\f                           PERRY v. BROWN                          1623\nnot others, whether or not it was required to confer that right\nor benefit in the first place. Thus, when Congress, having cho-\nsen to provide food stamps to the poor in the Food Stamp Act\nof 1964, amended the Act to exclude households of unrelated\nindividuals, such as “hippies” living in “hippie communes,”\nthe Supreme Court held the amendment unconstitutional\nbecause “a bare congressional desire to harm a politically\nunpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental\ninterest.” U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534\n(1973). In both Romer and Moreno, the constitutional viola-\ntion that the Supreme Court identified was not the failure to\nconfer a right or benefit in the first place; Congress was no\nmore obligated to provide food stamps than Colorado was to\nenact antidiscrimination laws. Rather, what the Supreme\nCourt forbade in each case was the targeted exclusion of a\ngroup of citizens from a right or benefit that they had enjoyed\non equal terms with all other citizens. The constitutional\ninjury that Romer and Moreno identified—and that serves as\na basis of our decision to strike down Proposition 8—has little\nto do with the substance of the right or benefit from which a\ngroup is excluded, and much to do with the act of exclusion\nitself. Proponents’ reliance on Crawford v. Board of Educa-\ntion, 458 U.S. 527 (1982), is therefore misplaced. In Craw-\nford, the Court affirmed Proposition 1, a California initiative\nconstitutional amendment that barred state courts from order-\ning school busing or pupil-assignment plans except when nec-\nessary to remedy a federal constitutional violation. Id. at 531-\n32. Like Proposition 8, Proposition 1 was adopted in response\nto a decision of the California Supreme Court under the state\nconstitution, which had held that state schools were obligated\nto take “reasonably feasible steps,” including busing and\npupil-assignment plans, “to alleviate school segregation.”\nCrawford v. Bd. of Educ., 551 P.2d 28, 45 (Cal. 1976). The\nSupreme Court “reject[ed] the contention that once a State\nchooses to do ‘more’ than the Fourteenth Amendment\nrequires, it may never recede.”17 Crawford, 458 U.S. at 535.\n  17\n    Additionally, the Court stated that it “would not interpret the Four-\nteenth Amendment to require the people of a State to adhere to a judicial\n\f1624                        PERRY v. BROWN\nThat conclusion was consistent with the principle that states\nshould be free “to experiment” with social policy, without\nfear of being locked in to “legislation that has proved unwork-\nable or harmful when the State was under no obligation to\nadopt the legislation in the first place.” Id. at 535, 539-40.\n\n   Critically, however, the Court noted that Proposition 1 did\nnot itself draw any classification; “[i]t simply forb[ade] state\ncourts” from ordering specific remedies under state law “in\nthe absence of a Fourteenth Amendment violation,” while\nmaintaining the state constitution’s more robust “right to\ndesegregation than exists under the Federal Constitution.” Id.\nat 537, 542 (emphasis added); see also id. at 544 (noting that\nother remedies remained available). Most important, the prop-\nosition’s purported benefit, “neighborhood schooling,” was\n“made available regardless of race.” Id. There was no evi-\ndence that the “purpose of [the] repealing legislation [was] to\n\nconstruction of their State Constitution when that Constitution itself vests\nfinal authority in the people.” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 540. In enacting\nProposition 8, the People did not “declare the state of the law as it existed\nwhen the Marriage Cases decision was rendered, but instead establishe[d]\na new substantive state constitutional rule” that amended the charter’s text\nto supersede the previous California Declaration of Rights. Strauss, 207\nP.3d at 115. The People thus acted as Congress does when it disapproves\nof a statutory interpretation by a federal court and enacts a new statute to\nproduce its preferred result. See, e.g., Religious Freedom Restoration Act\nof 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-141 (enacted in response to the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990)). Of\ncourse, Crawford did not suggest that it ends the inquiry to note that the\nFourteenth Amendment generally allows the People to exercise their state\nconstitutional right to supersede a decision of the state supreme court by\nan initiative constitutional amendment. A federal court must still deter-\nmine whether the constitutional amendment enacted by the People is oth-\nerwise valid under the Federal Constitution; sometimes laws passed\nbecause of disagreement with judicial decisions are not. Cf. City of Boerne\nv. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997) (holding the Religious Freedom Restora-\ntion Act unconstitutional in part). Proposition 1 was valid because, in\nsuperseding a decision of the California Supreme Court, it did not draw\nan improper classification among groups. Proposition 8 is invalid because\nit does.\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                            1625\ndisadvantage a racial minority,” which would have made the\nproposition unconstitutional. Id. at 539 n.21, 543-45 (citing\nReitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369 (1967)). Because Proposi-\ntion 1 did not establish any classification, and because it was\nsupported by permissible policy preferences against specific\ncourt remedies, the Supreme Court held that it was valid. On\nthe same day, by contrast, the Court struck down a similar\nWashington initiative, because it had been “drawn for racial\npurposes” in a manner that “impose[d] substantial and unique\nburdens on racial minorities” and accordingly violated the\nFourteenth Amendment. Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No.\n1, 458 U.S. 457, 470-71 (1982).\n\n   Romer, not Crawford, controls where a privilege or protec-\ntion is withdrawn without a legitimate reason from a class of\ndisfavored individuals, even if that right may not have been\nrequired by the Constitution in the first place. Although Colo-\nrado presented before the Supreme Court an argument regard-\ning Crawford identical to the one that Proponents present\nhere, that argument did not persuade the Court.18 Neither\nProposition 8 nor Amendment 2 was a law of general applica-\nbility that merely curtailed state courts’ remedial powers, as\nopposed to a single group’s rights. Rather, both Proposition 8\nand Amendment 2 “carve[d] out” rights from gays and lesbi-\nans alone. Unlike the measure in Crawford, Proposition 8 is\na “discrimination of an unusual character” that requires “care-\nful consideration” of its purposes and effects, whether or not\nthe Fourteenth Amendment required the right to be provided\n  18\n     See Petitioners’ Br. 32-33, 48, Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996)\n(No. 94-1039) (“Crawford controls this case. Through Amendment 2, Col-\norado has simply defined the package of civil rights available to homosex-\nuals and bisexuals under the Colorado Constitution as no larger than that\nprovided by the Constitution and laws of the United States. . . . While a\nstate or local government can grant more protection than that required by\nthe United States Constitution, a state or local government can also rescind\nthat additional protection—and prohibit its subsequent reextension—\nwithout committing a federal constitutional violation. [Crawford, 458 U.S.\nat 538-39.] Amendment 2 does nothing more.”).\n\f1626                       PERRY v. BROWN\nab initio. Following Romer, we must therefore decide whether\na legitimate interest exists that justifies the People of Califor-\nnia’s action in taking away from same-sex couples the right\nto use the official designation and enjoy the status of\n‘marriage’—a legitimate interest that suffices to overcome the\n“inevitable inference” of animus to which Proposition 8’s dis-\ncriminatory effects otherwise give rise.\n\n                                   D\n\n   We first consider four possible reasons offered by Propo-\nnents or amici to explain why Proposition 8 might have been\nenacted: (1) furthering California’s interest in childrearing\nand responsible procreation, (2) proceeding with caution\nbefore making significant changes to marriage, (3) protecting\nreligious freedom, and (4) preventing children from being\ntaught about same-sex marriage in schools. To be credited,\nthese rationales “must find some footing in the realities of the\nsubject addressed by the legislation.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S.\n312, 321 (1993). They are, conversely, not to be credited if\nthey “could not reasonably be conceived to be true by the\ngovernmental decisionmaker.” Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93,\n111 (1979).19 Because Proposition 8 did not further any of\nthese interests, we conclude that they cannot have been ratio-\nnal bases for this measure, whether or not they are legitimate\nstate interests.\n\n                                   1\n\n   The primary rationale Proponents offer for Proposition 8 is\nthat it advances California’s interest in responsible procre-\nation and childrearing. Proponents’ Br. 77-93. This rationale\nappears to comprise two distinct elements. The first is that\nchildren are better off when raised by two biological parents\n  19\n    As we have noted, we need not consider whether any form of height-\nened scrutiny is necessary or appropriate in order to reach the result we\ndo. See supra note 13.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1627\nand that society can increase the likelihood of that family\nstructure by allowing only potential biological parents—one\nman and one woman—to marry. The second is that marriage\nreduces the threat of “irresponsible procreation”—that is,\nunintended pregnancies out of wedlock—by providing an\nincentive for couples engaged in potentially procreative sex-\nual activity to form stable family units. Because same-sex\ncouples are not at risk of “irresponsible procreation” as a mat-\nter of biology, Proponents argue, there is simply no need to\noffer such couples the same incentives. Proposition 8 is not\nrationally related, however, to either of these purported inter-\nests, whether or not the interests would be legitimate under\nother circumstances.\n\n   [11] We need not decide whether there is any merit to the\nsociological premise of Proponents’ first argument—that fam-\nilies headed by two biological parents are the best environ-\nments in which to raise children—because even if Proponents\nare correct, Proposition 8 had absolutely no effect on the abil-\nity of same-sex couples to become parents or the manner in\nwhich children are raised in California. As we have explained,\nProposition 8 in no way modified the state’s laws governing\nparentage, which are distinct from its laws governing mar-\nriage. See Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61. Both before and after Prop-\nosition 8, committed opposite-sex couples (“spouses”) and\nsame-sex couples (“domestic partners”) had identical rights\nwith regard to forming families and raising children. See Cal.\nFam. Code § 297.5(d) (“The rights and obligations of regis-\ntered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of\nthem shall be the same as those of spouses.”). Similarly, Prop-\nosition 8 did not alter the California adoption or presumed-\nparentage laws, which continue to apply equally to same-sex\ncouples. Cf. Elisa B., 117 P.3d at 667-71 (applying the pre-\nsumed parentage statutes to a lesbian couple); Sharon S. v.\nSuper. Ct., 73 P.3d 554, 570 (Cal. 2003) (applying the adop-\ntion laws to a lesbian couple). In order to be rationally related\nto the purpose of funneling more childrearing into families led\n\f1628                         PERRY v. BROWN\nby two biological parents, Proposition 8 would have had to\nmodify these laws in some way. It did not do so.20\n\n   Moreover, California’s “current policies and conduct . . .\nrecognize that gay individuals are fully capable of . . . respon-\nsibly caring for and raising children.” Marriage Cases, 183\nP.3d at 428. And California law actually prefers a non-\nbiological parent who has a parental relationship with a child\nto a biological parent who does not; in California, the parent-\nage statutes place a premium on the “social relationship,” not\nthe “biological relationship,” between a parent and a child.\nSee, e.g., Susan H. v. Jack S., 30 Cal. App. 4th 1435, 1442-43\n(1994). California thus has demonstrated through its laws that\nProponents’ first rationale cannot “reasonably be conceived to\nbe true by the governmental decisionmaker,” Vance, 440 U.S.\nat 111. We will not credit a justification for Proposition 8 that\nis totally inconsistent with the measure’s actual effect and\nwith the operation of California’s family laws both before and\nafter its enactment.\n\n   Proponents’ second argument is that there is no need to\nhold out the designation of ‘marriage’ as an encouragement\nfor same-sex couples to engage in responsible procreation,\n  20\n     For the reasons explained above, Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bru-\nning, 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006), is not applicable here. As our dissent-\ning colleague states, the fact that Proposition 8 left intact California’s laws\nconcerning family formation and childrearing by same-sex couples distin-\nguishes this case from Citizens. See Dissent at 1669 (“Unlike the Nebraska\nconstitutional amendment, which prohibited the recognition of both mar-\nriages by same-sex couples and other same-sex relationships, Proposition\n8 left California’s existing domestic partnership laws intact. . . . Thus, it\ncannot be said that Proposition 8 ‘confer[s] the inducements of marital . . .\nbenefits on opposite-sex couples . . . , but not on same-sex couples . . . .\n’ ” (all but first alteration in original)).\n  We also note that the Nebraska constitutional amendment at issue in\nCitizens did not withdraw an existing right from same-sex couples as did\nProposition 8. Cf. Dissent at 1660 n.2. (“[W]hile the withdrawal of a right\nmay not be analytically significant for rational basis review, it may still\nbe factually significant.”).\n\f                           PERRY v. BROWN                          1629\nbecause unlike opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples pose\nno risk of procreating accidentally. Proponents contend that\nCalifornia need not extend marriage to same-sex couples\nwhen the State’s interest in responsible procreation would not\nbe advanced by doing so, even if the interest would not be\nharmed, either. See Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 383\n(1974) (“When . . . the inclusion of one group promotes a\nlegitimate governmental purpose, and the addition of other\ngroups would not, we cannot say that the statute’s classifica-\ntion of beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries is invidiously dis-\ncriminatory.”). But Plaintiffs do not ask that marriage be\nextended to anyone. As we have by now made clear, the ques-\ntion is whether there is a legitimate governmental interest in\nwithdrawing access to marriage from same-sex couples. We\ntherefore need not decide whether, under Johnson, California\nwould be justified in not extending the designation of ‘mar-\nriage’ to same-sex couples; that is not what Proposition 8 did.\nJohnson concerns decisions not to add to a legislative scheme\na group that is unnecessary to the purposes of that scheme, but\nProposition 8 subtracted a disfavored group from a scheme of\nwhich it already was a part.21\n\n   Under Romer, it is no justification for taking something\naway to say that there was no need to provide it in the first\nplace; instead, there must be some legitimate reason for the\nact of taking it away, a reason that overcomes the “inevitable\ninference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity\ntoward the class of persons affected.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 634.\nIn order to explain how rescinding access to the designation\nof ‘marriage’ is rationally related to the State’s interest in\nresponsible procreation, Proponents would have had to argue\nthat opposite-sex couples were more likely to procreate acci-\ndentally or irresponsibly when same-sex couples were\n  21\n    Moreover, Johnson did not involve a dignitary benefit that was with-\ndrawn from one group, such as an official and meaningful state designa-\ntion that established the societal status of the members of the group; it\nconcerned only a specific form of government assistance.\n\f1630                    PERRY v. BROWN\nallowed access to the designation of ‘marriage.’ We are aware\nof no basis on which this argument would be even conceiv-\nably plausible. There is no rational reason to think that taking\naway the designation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples\nwould advance the goal of encouraging California’s opposite-\nsex couples to procreate more responsibly. The Johnson argu-\nment, to put it mildly, does not help Proponents’ cause.\n\n   Given the realities of California law, and of human nature,\nboth parts of Proponents’ primary rationale simply “find [no]\nfooting in the realities of the subject addressed by the legisla-\ntion,” and thus cannot be credited as rational. Heller, 509 U.S.\nat 321. Whatever sense there may be in preferring biological\nparents over other couples—and we need not decide whether\nthere is any—California law clearly does not recognize such\na preference, and Proposition 8 did nothing to change that cir-\ncumstance. The same is true for Proponents’ argument that it\nis unnecessary to extend the right to use the designation of\n‘marriage’ to couples who cannot procreate, because the pur-\npose of the designation is to reward couples who procreate\nresponsibly or to encourage couples who wish to procreate to\nmarry first. Whatever merit this argument may have—and\nagain, we need not decide whether it has any—the argument\nis addressed to a failure to afford the use of the designation\nof ‘marriage’ to same-sex couples in the first place; it is irrel-\nevant to a measure withdrawing from them, and only them,\nuse of that designation.\n\n   The same analysis applies to the arguments of some amici\ncuriae that Proposition 8 not only promotes responsible pro-\ncreation and childrearing as a general matter but promotes the\nsingle best family structure for such activities. See, e.g., Br.\nAmicus Curiae of High Impact Leadership Coalition, et al. 14\n(“Society has a compelling interest in preserving the institu-\ntion that best advances the social interests in responsible pro-\ncreation, and that connects procreation to responsible child-\nrearing.”); Br. Amicus Curiae of Am. Coll. of Pediatricians 15\n(“[T]he State has a legitimate interest in promoting the family\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                             1631\nstructure that has proven most likely to foster an optimal envi-\nronment for the rearing of children.”). As discussed above,\nProposition 8 in no way alters the state laws that govern child-\nrearing and procreation. It makes no change with respect to\nthe laws regarding family structure. As before Proposition 8,\nthose laws apply in the same way to same-sex couples in\ndomestic partnerships and to married couples. Only the desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’ is withdrawn and only from one group of\nindividuals.\n\n   [12] We in no way mean to suggest that Proposition 8\nwould be constitutional if only it had gone further—for exam-\nple, by also repealing same-sex couples’ equal parental rights\nor their rights to share community property or enjoy hospital\nvisitation privileges. Only if Proposition 8 had actually had\nany effect on childrearing or “responsible procreation” would\nit be necessary or appropriate for us to consider the legitimacy\nof Proponents’ primary rationale for the measure.22 Here,\ngiven all other pertinent aspects of California law, Proposition\n8 simply could not have the effect on procreation or child-\n  22\n     The difference between what Proposition 8 did take away—only the\nname ‘marriage’—and what it might also have taken away—any of the\nsubstantive “incidents of marriage” that same-sex couples still enjoy—\ninfluenced the underlying politics of Proposition 8 and shapes the basic\nissues in this case. The official argument in favor of Proposition 8, pub-\nlished in the Voter Information Guide, emphasized this distinction: “Prop-\nosition 8 doesn’t take away any rights or benefits of gay or lesbian\ndomestic partnerships. Under California law, ‘domestic partners shall have\nthe same rights, protections, and benefits’ as married spouses. (Family\nCode § 297.5.) There are NO exceptions. Proposition 8 WILL NOT\nchange this.” Voter Information Guide at 56. Moreover, Strauss observed\n“that an alternative, much more sweeping initiative measure—proposing\nthe addition of a new constitutional section that would have provided not\nonly that ‘[o]nly marriage between one man and one woman is valid or\nrecognized in California,’ but also that ‘[n]either the Legislature nor any\ncourt, government institution, government agency, initiative statute, local\ngovernment, or government official shall . . . bestow statutory rights, inci-\ndents, or employee benefits of marriage on unmarried individuals’—was\ncirculated for signature at the same time as Proposition 8, but did not\nobtain sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.” 207 P.3d at 76 n.8.\n\f1632                        PERRY v. BROWN\nbearing that Proponents claim it might have been intended to\nhave. Accordingly, an interest in responsible procreation and\nchildbearing cannot provide a rational basis for the measure.\n\n   We add one final note. To the extent that it has been argued\nthat withdrawing from same-sex couples access to the desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’—without in any way altering the sub-\nstantive laws concerning their rights regarding childrearing or\nfamily formation—will encourage heterosexual couples to\nenter into matrimony, or will strengthen their matrimonial\nbonds, we believe that the People of California “could not\nreasonably” have “conceived” such an argument “to be true.”\nVance, 440 U.S. at 111. It is implausible to think that denying\ntwo men or two women the right to call themselves married\ncould somehow bolster the stability of families headed by one\nman and one woman. While deferential, the rational-basis\nstandard “is not a toothless one.” Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S.\n495, 510 (1976). “[E]ven the standard of rationality . . . must\nfind some footing in the realities of the subject addressed by\nthe legislation.” Heller, 509 U.S. at 321. Here, the argument\nthat withdrawing the designation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex\ncouples could on its own promote the strength or stability of\nopposite-sex marital relationships lacks any such footing in\nreality.\n\n                                    2\n\n   [13] Proponents offer an alternative justification for Propo-\nsition 8: that it advances California’s interest in “proceed[ing]\nwith caution” when considering changes to the definition of\nmarriage. Proponents’ Br. 93. But this rationale, too, bears no\nconnection to the reality of Proposition 8. The amendment\nwas enacted after the State had provided same-sex couples the\nright to marry and after more than 18,000 couples had mar-\nried (and remain married even after Proposition 8, Strauss,\n207 P.3d at 122).23\n  23\n     The over 18,000 couples that did marry represented more than one-\nthird of all couples that had entered into registered domestic partnerships\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                            1633\n   Perhaps what Proponents mean is that California had an\ninterest in pausing at 18,000 married same-sex couples to\nevaluate whether same-sex couples should continue to be\nallowed to marry, or whether the same-sex marriages that had\nalready occurred were having any adverse impact on society.\nEven if that were so, there could be no rational connection\nbetween the asserted purpose of “proceeding with caution”\nand the enactment of an absolute ban, unlimited in time, on\nsame-sex marriage in the state constitution.24 To enact a con-\nstitutional prohibition is to adopt a fundamental barrier: it\nmeans that the legislative process, by which incremental poli-\ncymaking would normally proceed, is completely foreclosed.\nCf. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U.S. 483,\n489 (1955) (observing that legislatures may rationally reform\npolicy “one step at a time”). Once Proposition 8 was enacted,\nany future steps forward, however cautious, would require\n“enlisting the citizenry of [California] to amend the State\nConstitution” once again. Romer, 517 U.S. at 631.\n\n   Had Proposition 8 imposed not a total ban but a time-\nspecific moratorium on same-sex marriages, during which the\nLegislature would have been authorized to consider the ques-\ntion in detail or at the end of which the People would have\nhad to vote again to renew the ban, the amendment might\nplausibly have been designed to “proceed with caution.” In\nthat case, we would have had to consider whether the objec-\ntive of “proceed[ing] with caution” was a legitimate one. But\nthat is not what Proposition 8 did. The amendment superseded\nthe Marriage Cases and then went further, by prohibiting the\n\nin California at the time. See Gary J. Gates et al., The Williams Institute,\nMarriage, Registration and Dissolution by Same-Sex Couples in the U.S.\n5 (July 2008) (noting that there were 48,157 registered domestic partner-\nships in California as of Spring 2008).\n   24\n      When the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified, the Nation was simi-\nlarly not interested in “proceeding with caution” in reallocating grain from\nwartime rations to alcohol production. It meant, instead, to effect a perma-\nnent ban on alcohol.\n\f1634                       PERRY v. BROWN\nLegislature or even the People (except by constitutional\namendment) from choosing to make the designation of ‘mar-\nriage’ available to same-sex couples in the future. Such a per-\nmanent ban cannot be rationally related to an interest in\nproceeding with caution.\n\n   [14] In any event, in light of the express purpose of Propo-\nsition 8 and the campaign to enact it, it is not credible to sug-\ngest that “proceed[ing] with caution” was the reason the\nvoters adopted the measure. The purpose and effect of Propo-\nsition 8 was “to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to\nmarry in California”—not to “suspend” or “study” that right.\nVoter Information Guide at 54 (Proposition 8, Official Title\nand Summary) (emphasis added).25 The voters were told that\nProposition 8 would “overturn[ ]” the Marriage Cases “to\nRESTORE the meaning of marriage.” Id. at 56 (Argument in\nFavor of Proposition 8). The avowed purpose of Proposition\n8 was to return with haste to a time when same-sex couples\nwere barred from using the official designation of ‘marriage,’\nnot to study the matter further before deciding whether to\nmake the designation more equally available.\n\n                                   3\n\n   [15] We briefly consider two other potential rationales for\nProposition 8, not raised by Proponents but offered by amici\ncuriae. First is the argument that Proposition 8 advanced the\nState’s interest in protecting religious liberty. See, e.g., Br.\nAmicus Curiae of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty\n(Becket Br.) 2. There is no dispute that even before Proposi-\ntion 8, “no religion [was] required to change its religious poli-\ncies or practices with regard to same-sex couples, and no\nreligious officiant [was] required to solemnize a marriage in\n  25\n     In California, “[b]allot summaries . . . in the ‘Voter Information\nGuide’ are recognized sources for determining the voters’ intent.” People\nv. Garrett, 92 Cal. App. 4th 1417, 1426 (2001) (citing Hodges v. Super.\nCt., 980 P.2d 433, 438-39 (Cal. 1999)).\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1635\ncontravention of his or her religious beliefs.” Marriage Cases,\n183 P.3d at 451-52; see Becket Br. 4-5 (acknowledging this\npoint). Rather, the religious-liberty interest that Proposition 8\nsupposedly promoted was to decrease the likelihood that reli-\ngious organizations would be penalized, under California’s\nantidiscrimination laws and other government policies con-\ncerning sexual orientation, for refusing to provide services to\nfamilies headed by same-sex spouses. But Proposition 8 did\nnothing to affect those laws. To the extent that California’s\nantidiscrimination laws apply to various activities of religious\norganizations, their protections apply in the same way as\nbefore. Amicus’s argument is thus more properly read as an\nappeal to the Legislature, seeking reform of the State’s\nantidiscrimination laws to include greater accommodations\nfor religious organizations. See, e.g., Becket Br. 8 n.6\n(“Unlike many other states, California has no religious\nexemptions to its statutory bans on gender, marital status, and\nsexual orientation discrimination in public accommoda-\ntions.”). This argument is in no way addressed by Proposition\n8 and could not have been the reason for Proposition 8.\n\n   [16] Second is the argument, prominent during the cam-\npaign to pass Proposition 8, that it would “protect[ ] our chil-\ndren from being taught in public schools that ‘same-sex\nmarriage’ is the same as traditional marriage.” Perry IV, 704\nF. Supp. 2d at 930, 989-90 (quoting the Voter Information\nGuide at 56) (emphasis omitted); see Br. Amicus Curiae for\nthe Hausvater Project 13-15. Yet again, California law belies\nthe premise of this justification. Both before and after Propo-\nsition 8, schools have not been required to teach anything\nabout same-sex marriage. They “may . . . elect[ ] to offer\ncomprehensive sexual health education”; only then might they\nbe required to “teach respect for marriage and committed rela-\ntionships.” Cal. Educ. Code § 51933(a)-(b), (b)(7). Both\nbefore and after Proposition 8, schools have retained control\nover the content of such lessons. And both before and after\nProposition 8, schools and individual teachers have been pro-\nhibited from giving any instruction that discriminates on the\n\f1636                     PERRY v. BROWN\nbasis of sexual orientation; now as before, students could not\nbe taught the superiority or inferiority of either same- or\nopposite-sex marriage or other “committed relationships.”\nCal. Educ. Code §§ 51500, 51933(b)(4). The Marriage Cases\ntherefore did not weaken, and Proposition 8 did not\nstrengthen, the rights of schools to control their curricula and\nof parents to control their children’s education.\n\n   There is a limited sense in which the extension of the desig-\nnation ‘marriage’ to same-sex partnerships might alter the\ncontent of the lessons that schools choose to teach. Schools\nteach about the world as it is; when the world changes, les-\nsons change. A shift in the State’s marriage law may therefore\naffect the content of classroom instruction just as would the\nelection of a new governor, the discovery of a new chemical\nelement, or the adoption of a new law permitting no-fault\ndivorce: students learn about these as empirical facts of the\nworld around them. But to protest the teaching of these facts\nis little different from protesting their very existence; it is like\nopposing the election of a particular governor on the ground\nthat students would learn about his holding office, or oppos-\ning the legitimation of no-fault divorce because a teacher\nmight allude to that fact if a course in societal structure were\ntaught to graduating seniors. The prospect of children learning\nabout the laws of the State and society’s assessment of the\nlegal rights of its members does not provide an independent\nreason for stripping members of a disfavored group of those\nrights they presently enjoy.\n\n                                 4\n\n   Proposition 8’s only effect, we have explained, was to\nwithdraw from gays and lesbians the right to employ the des-\nignation of ‘marriage’ to describe their committed relation-\nships and thus to deprive them of a societal status that affords\ndignity to those relationships. Proposition 8 could not have\nreasonably been enacted to promote childrearing by biological\nparents, to encourage responsible procreation, to proceed with\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1637\ncaution in social change, to protect religious liberty, or to con-\ntrol the education of schoolchildren. Simply taking away the\ndesignation of ‘marriage,’ while leaving in place all the sub-\nstantive rights and responsibilities of same-sex partners, did\nnot do any of the things its Proponents now suggest were its\npurposes. Proposition 8 “is so far removed from these particu-\nlar justifications that we find it impossible to credit them.”\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 635. We therefore need not, and do not,\ndecide whether any of these purported rationales for the law\nwould be “legitimate,” id. at 632, or would suffice to justify\nProposition 8 if the amendment actually served to further\nthem.\n\n                                E\n\n                                1\n\n   We are left to consider why else the People of California\nmight have enacted a constitutional amendment that takes\naway from gays and lesbians the right to use the designation\nof ‘marriage.’ One explanation is the desire to revert to the\nway things were prior to the Marriage Cases, when ‘mar-\nriage’ was available only to opposite-sex couples, as had been\nthe case since the founding of the State and in other jurisdic-\ntions long before that. This purpose is one that Proposition 8\nactually did accomplish: it “restore[d] the traditional defini-\ntion of marriage as referring to a union between a man and a\nwoman.” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 76. But tradition alone is not a\njustification for taking away a right that had already been\ngranted, even though that grant was in derogation of tradition.\nIn Romer, it did not matter that at common law, gays and les-\nbians were afforded no protection from discrimination in the\nprivate sphere; Amendment 2 could not be justified on the\nbasis that it simply repealed positive law and restored the “tra-\nditional” state of affairs. 517 U.S. at 627-29. Precisely the\nsame is true here.\n\n  Laws may be repealed and new rights taken away if they\nhave had unintended consequences or if there is some con-\n\f1638                     PERRY v. BROWN\nceivable affirmative good that revocation would produce, cf.\nCrawford, 458 U.S. at 539-40, but new rights may not be\nstripped away solely because they are new. Tradition is a\nlegitimate consideration in policymaking, of course, but it\ncannot be an end unto itself. Cf. Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S.\n235, 239-40 (1970). “[T]he fact that the governing majority in\na State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as\nimmoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohib-\niting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a\nlaw prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.”\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 577-78 (2003); see Loving\nv. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967) (noting the historical pedigree\nof bans on interracial marriage but not even considering tradi-\ntion as a possible justification for Virginia’s law). If tradition\nalone is insufficient to justify maintaining a prohibition with\na discriminatory effect, then it is necessarily insufficient to\njustify changing the law to revert to a previous state. A prefer-\nence for the way things were before same-sex couples were\nallowed to marry, without any identifiable good that a return\nto the past would produce, amounts to an impermissible pref-\nerence against same-sex couples themselves, as well as their\nfamilies.\n\n   [17] Absent any legitimate purpose for Proposition 8, we\nare left with “the inevitable inference that the disadvantage\nimposed is born of animosity toward,” or, as is more likely\nwith respect to Californians who voted for the Proposition,\nmere disapproval of, “the class of persons affected.” Romer,\n517 U.S. at 634. We do not mean to suggest that Proposition\n8 is the result of ill will on the part of the voters of California.\n“Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from\nmalice or hostile animus alone.” Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of\nAla. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 (2001) (Kennedy, J., con-\ncurring). Disapproval may also be the product of longstand-\ning, sincerely held private beliefs. Still, while “[p]rivate\nbiases may be outside the reach of the law, . . . the law cannot,\ndirectly or indirectly, give them effect.” Palmore v. Sidoti,\n466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984). Ultimately, the “inevitable infer-\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                       1639\nence” we must draw in this circumstance is not one of ill will,\nbut rather one of disapproval of gays and lesbians as a class.\n“[L]aws singling out a certain class of citizens for disfavored\nlegal status or general hardships are rare.” Romer, 517 U.S. at\n633. Under Romer, we must infer from Proposition 8’s effect\non California law that the People took away from gays and\nlesbians the right to use the official designation of ‘marriage’\n—and the societal status that accompanies it—because they\ndisapproved of these individuals as a class and did not wish\nthem to receive the same official recognition and societal\napproval of their committed relationships that the State makes\navailable to opposite-sex couples.\n\n   [18] It will not do to say that Proposition 8 was intended\nonly to disapprove of same-sex marriage, rather than to pass\njudgment on same-sex couples as people. Just as the criminal-\nization of “homosexual conduct . . . is an invitation to subject\nhomosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and\nin the private spheres,” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 575, so too\ndoes the elimination of the right to use the official designation\nof ‘marriage’ for the relationships of committed same-sex\ncouples send a message that gays and lesbians are of lesser\nworth as a class—that they enjoy a lesser societal status.\nIndeed, because laws affecting gays and lesbians’ rights often\nregulate individual conduct—what sexual activity people may\nundertake in the privacy of their own homes, or who is per-\nmitted to marry whom—as much as they regulate status, the\nSupreme Court has “declined to distinguish between status\nand conduct in [the] context” of sexual orientation. Christian\nLegal Soc’y v. Martinez, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 2990 (2010). By\nwithdrawing the availability of the recognized designation of\n‘marriage,’ Proposition 8 enacts nothing more or less than a\njudgment about the worth and dignity of gays and lesbians as\na class.\n\n   [19] Just as a “desire to harm . . . cannot constitute a legiti-\nmate governmental interest,” Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534, nei-\nther can a more basic disapproval of a class of people. Romer,\n\f1640                        PERRY v. BROWN\n517 U.S. at 633-35. “The issue is whether the majority may\nuse the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole\nsociety” through a law that abridges minority individuals’\nrights. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 571. It may not. Without more,\n“[m]oral disapproval of [a] group, like a bare desire to harm\nthe group, is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational\nbasis review under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 582\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). Society does sometimes draw\nclassifications that likely are rooted partially in disapproval,\nsuch as a law that grants educational benefits to veterans but\ndenies them to conscientious objectors who engaged in alter-\nnative civilian service. See Johnson, 415 U.S. at 362-64.\nThose classifications will not be invalidated so long as they\ncan be justified by reference to some independent purpose\nthey serve; in Johnson, they could provide an incentive for\nmilitary service and direct assistance to those who needed the\nmost help in readjusting to post-war life, see id. at 376-83.\nEnacting a rule into law based solely on the disapproval of a\ngroup, however, “is a classification of persons undertaken for\nits own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not\npermit.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 635. Like Amendment 2, Propo-\nsition 8 is a classification of gays and lesbians undertaken for\nits own sake.\n\n                                    2\n\n   The “inference” that Proposition 8 was born of disapproval\nof gays and lesbians is heightened by evidence of the context\nin which the measure was passed.26 The district court found\nthat “[t]he campaign to pass Proposition 8 relied on stereo-\n  26\n     A contextual evaluation is both useful and appropriate as part of the\n“careful consideration” in which courts must engage when faced with\n“[d]iscriminations of an unusual character.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted); see Moreno, 413 U.S. at 533-38. When a\nlaw is enacted by ballot initiative, we look to objective indicators of the\nvoters’ motivations, such as campaign materials, to shed light on the “his-\ntorical context.” S. Alameda Spanish Speaking Org. v. Union City, 424\nF.2d 291, 295 (9th Cir. 1970); see, e.g., Washington, 458 U.S. at 463.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1641\ntypes to show that same-sex relationships are inferior to\nopposite-sex relationships.” Perry IV, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 990.\nTelevision and print advertisements “focused on . . . the con-\ncern that people of faith and religious groups would somehow\nbe harmed by the recognition of gay marriage” and “conveyed\na message that gay people and relationships are inferior, that\nhomosexuality is undesirable and that children need to be pro-\ntected from exposure to gay people and their relationships.”\nId. These messages were not crafted accidentally. The strate-\ngists responsible for the campaign in favor of Proposition 8\nlater explained their approach: “ ‘[T]here were limits to the\ndegree of tolerance Californians would afford the gay com-\nmunity. They would entertain allowing gay marriage, but not\nif doing so had significant implications for the rest of soci-\nety,’ ” such as what children would be taught in school. Id. at\n988 (quoting Frank Schubert & Jeff Flint, Passing Prop 8,\nPolitics, Feb. 2009, at 45-47). Nor were these messages new;\nfor decades, ballot measures regarding homosexuality have\nbeen presented to voters in terms designed to appeal to stereo-\ntypes of gays and lesbians as predators, threats to children,\nand practitioners of a deviant “lifestyle.” See Br. Amicus\nCuriae of Constitutional Law Professors at 2-8. The messages\npresented here mimic those presented to Colorado voters in\nsupport of Amendment 2, such as, “Homosexual indoctrina-\ntion in the schools? IT’S HAPPENING IN COLORADO!”\nColorado for Family Values, Equal Rights—Not Special\nRights, at 2 (1992), reprinted in Robert Nagel, Playing\nDefense, 6 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 167, 193 (1997).\n\n   [20] When directly enacted legislation “singl[es] out a cer-\ntain class of citizens for disfavored legal status,” we must “in-\nsist on knowing the relation between the classification\nadopted and the object to be attained,” so that we may ensure\nthat the law exists “to further a proper legislative end” rather\nthan “to make the[ ] [class] unequal to everyone else.” Romer,\n517 U.S. at 632-33, 635. Proposition 8 fails this test. Its sole\npurpose and effect is “to eliminate the right of same-sex cou-\nples to marry in California”—to dishonor a disfavored group\n\f1642                    PERRY v. BROWN\nby taking away the official designation of approval of their\ncommitted relationships and the accompanying societal status,\nand nothing more. Voter Information Guide at 54. “It is at\nonce too narrow and too broad,” for it changes the law far too\nlittle to have any of the effects it purportedly was intended to\nyield, yet it dramatically reduces the societal standing of gays\nand lesbians and diminishes their dignity. Romer, 517 U.S. at\n633. Proposition 8 did not result from a legitimate “Kultur-\nkampf” concerning the structure of families in California,\nbecause it had no effect on family structure, but in order to\nstrike it down, we need not go so far as to find that it was\nenacted in “a fit of spite.” Id. at 636 (Scalia, J., dissenting).\nIt is enough to say that Proposition 8 operates with no appar-\nent purpose but to impose on gays and lesbians, through the\npublic law, a majority’s private disapproval of them and their\nrelationships, by taking away from them the official designa-\ntion of ‘marriage,’ with its societally recognized status. Prop-\nosition 8 therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                               VI\n\n   Finally, we address Proponents’ motion to vacate the dis-\ntrict court’s judgment. On April 6, 2011, after resigning from\nthe bench, former Chief Judge Walker disclosed that he was\ngay and that he had for the past ten years been in a relation-\nship with another man. Proponents moved shortly thereafter\nto vacate the judgment on the basis that 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(4)\nobligated Chief Judge Walker to recuse himself, because he\nhad an “interest that could be substantially affected by the\noutcome of the proceeding,” and that 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) obli-\ngated him either to recuse himself or to disclose his potential\nconflict, because “his impartiality might reasonably be ques-\ntioned.” Chief Judge Ware, to whom this case was assigned\nafter Chief Judge Walker’s retirement, denied the motion after\nreceiving briefs and hearing argument.\n\n  The district court properly held that it had jurisdiction to\nhear and deny the motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1(a), that\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1643\nthe motion was timely, and that Chief Judge Walker had no\nobligation to recuse himself under either § 455(b)(4) or\n§ 455(a) or to disclose any potential conflict. As Chief Judge\nWare explained, the fact that a judge “could be affected by the\noutcome of a proceeding[,] in the same way that other mem-\nbers of the general public would be affected, is not a basis for\neither recusal or disqualification under Section 455(b)(4).”\nPerry v. Schwarzenegger, 790 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1122 (N.D.\nCal. 2011); see In re City of Houston, 745 F.2d 925, 929-30\n(5th Cir. 1984) (“We recognize that ‘an interest which a judge\nhas in common with many others in a public matter is not suf-\nficient to disqualify him.’ ”). Nor could it possibly be “reason-\nable to presume,” for the purposes of § 455(a), “that a judge\nis incapable of making an impartial decision about the consti-\ntutionality of a law, solely because, as a citizen, the judge\ncould be affected by the proceeding.” 790 F. Supp. 2d at\n1122; see United States v. Alabama, 828 F.2d 1532, 1541-42\n(11th Cir. 1987). To hold otherwise would demonstrate a lack\nof respect for the integrity of our federal courts.\n\n   [21] The denial of the motion to vacate was premised on\nChief Judge Ware’s finding that Chief Judge Walker was not\nobligated to recuse himself. “We review the district court’s\ndenial of a motion to vacate the judgment for an abuse of dis-\ncretion.” Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, 365 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.\n2004). Our standard for abuse of discretion requires us to (1)\n“look to whether the trial court identified and applied the cor-\nrect legal rule to the relief requested”; and, if the trial court\napplied the correct legal rule, to (2) “look to whether the trial\ncourt’s resolution . . . resulted from a factual finding that was\nillogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that\nmay be drawn from the facts in the record.” United States v.\nHinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1263 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc).\nHere, Chief Judge Ware did not incorrectly apply the law. He\nidentified and applied § 455(b)(4) and § 455(a), the correct\nlegal rules, as well as the relevant precedents. His application\nof the law, determining whether Chief Judge Walker was obli-\ngated to recuse himself, was discretionary. See United States\n\f1644                    PERRY v. BROWN\nv. Johnson, 610 F.3d 1138, 1147-48 (9th Cir. 2010). His reso-\nlution of the issue on the basis of the facts was not illogical,\nimplausible, or without support in inferences that may be\ndrawn from the facts in the record. Thus, we affirm Chief\nJudge Ware’s decision not to grant the motion to vacate.\n\n                               VII\n\n   By using their initiative power to target a minority group\nand withdraw a right that it possessed, without a legitimate\nreason for doing so, the People of California violated the\nEqual Protection Clause. We hold Proposition 8 to be uncon-\nstitutional on this ground. We do not doubt the importance of\nthe more general questions presented to us concerning the\nrights of same-sex couples to marry, nor do we doubt that\nthese questions will likely be resolved in other states, and for\nthe nation as a whole, by other courts. For now, it suffices to\nconclude that the People of California may not, consistent\nwith the Federal Constitution, add to their state constitution a\nprovision that has no more practical effect than to strip gays\nand lesbians of their right to use the official designation that\nthe State and society give to committed relationships, thereby\nadversely affecting the status and dignity of the members of\na disfavored class. The judgment of the district court is\n\n  AFFIRMED.27\n\n\n\n\n  27\n   The stay pending appeal issued by this court on August 16, 2010\nremains in effect pending issuance of the mandate.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                     1645\nN.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part:\n\n   I agree with the majority’s analysis and decisions in parts\nIII and VI of its opinion, determining that (1) the Proponents\nhave standing to bring this appeal; and (2) the Motion to\nVacate the Judgment should be denied. Because I do not\nagree with the majority’s analysis of other topics regarding\nthe constitutionality of Proposition 8, I have chosen to write\nseparately. Ultimately, I am not convinced that Proposition 8\nis not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nI must therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n   Before addressing the issues now presented before our\npanel, I want to emphasize a distinguishing point in my analy-\nsis from what may be anticipated by the reader. Similar to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court in its prior opinion concerning\nProposition 8, our panel was not tasked with determining\nwhether this constitutional amendment “is wise or sound as a\nmatter of policy or whether we, as individuals, believe it\nshould be a part of the California Constitution.” Strauss v.\nHorton, 207 P.3d 48, 59 (Cal. 2009). Our personal views\nregarding the political and sociological debate on marriage\nequality are irrelevant to our task. Instead, we are only asked\nto consider the constitutional validity of Proposition 8 under\nthe federal Constitution. The California Supreme Court has\nalready interpreted and applied “the principles and rules\nembodied in the California Constitution” to Proposition 8 and\nfound it valid. Strauss, 207 P.3d 48.\n\n                               I.\n\n   Proponents and their supporting amici (hereinafter Propo-\nnents) argue that the United States Supreme Court’s summary\ndismissal in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972) (mem.),\n“mandates reversal of the district court’s ruling.” According\nto Proponents, the claims raised here are the same as those\nrejected in Baker, and the claims are therefore foreclosed by\n\f1646                     PERRY v. BROWN\nthat decision. The majority dispenses with Baker in a foot-\nnote. However, other federal courts have indicated that Baker,\nif it is not controlling, at least stands for exercising “restraint”\nwhen it comes to addressing due process and equal protection\nchallenges against laws prohibiting marriage by same-sex\ncouples. Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 455 F.3d\n859, 870 (8th Cir. 2006); see also Wilson v. Ake, 354 F. Supp.\n2d 1298, 1305 (M.D. Fla. 2005) (“Baker v. Nelson is binding\nprecedent upon this Court . . . .”). But see In re Kandu, 315\nB.R. 123, 138 (Bankr. W.D. Wash. 2004) (concluding that\n“Baker is not binding precedent on the issues presented”\nbecause the case centered on federal Defense of Marriage Act\nand because “doctrinal developments” indicated Baker was no\nlonger binding). Because Baker is binding United States\nSupreme Court precedent and may foreclose Plaintiffs’\nclaims, one must follow it or distinguish it.\n\n                                A.\n\n   In Baker v. Nelson, two men were denied a marriage\nlicense by a Minnesota county clerk. 191 N.W.2d 185, 185\n(Minn. 1971). Because they were denied the license, the two\nmen filed suit asking that the court force the clerk to grant the\nlicense. Id. In Minnesota Statutes c. 517, the Minnesota state\nlegislature had codified that the state “d[id] not authorize mar-\nriage between persons of the same sex. . . .” Id. at 186. On\nappeal, the Minnesota Supreme Court addressed several\nissues, including whether the Minnesota statutes prohibiting\nmarriage by same-sex couples denied the petitioners “the\nequal protection of the laws” as guaranteed by the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Id. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that\n“[t]he equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n. . . is not offended by the state’s classification of persons\nauthorized to marry.” Id. at 187. On appeal to the United\nStates Supreme Court, the Court summarily dismissed the\nappeal “for want of a substantial federal question.” Baker v.\nNelson, 409 U.S. 810.\n\f                       PERRY v. BROWN                        1647\n   Though not stated in the summary dismissal in Baker, the\nSupreme Court decision has long standing precedent support-\ning it. Throughout our nation’s history, the States have had\n“the absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the\nmarriage relation between its own citizens shall be credited\n. . . .” Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 734-35 (1878), reaf-\nfirmed in Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404 (1975).\n\n    Marriage, as creating the most important relation in\n    life, as having more to do with the morals and civili-\n    zation of a people than any other institution, has\n    always been subject to the control of the legislature.\n    That body prescribes the age at which parties may\n    contract to marry, the procedure or form essential to\n    constitute marriage, the duties and obligations it\n    creates, its effects upon the property rights of both,\n    present and prospective, and the acts which may\n    constitute grounds for its dissolution.\n\nMaynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 205 (1888).\n\n  As Justice Stewart opined in his concurrence in Zablocki v.\nRedhail, a State\n\n    may in many circumstances absolutely prohibit\n    [marriage]. Surely, for example, a State may legiti-\n    mately say that no one can marry his or her sibling,\n    that no one can marry who is not at least 14 years\n    old, that no one can marry without first passing an\n    examination for venereal disease, or that no one can\n    marry who has a living husband or wife.\n\n434 U.S. 374, 392 (1978) (Stewart, J., concurring).\n\n   The summary dismissal of an appeal for want of a substan-\ntial federal question is a decision on the merits. Hicks v.\nMiranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344 (1975). “[U]nless and until the\nSupreme Court should instruct otherwise, inferior federal\n\f1648                    PERRY v. BROWN\ncourts had best adhere to the view that if the Court has\nbranded a question as unsubstantial, it remains so except\nwhen doctrinal developments indicate otherwise . . . .” Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “[L]ower courts are bound\nby summary decisions by [the Supreme] Court until such time\nas the Court informs (them) that (they) are not.” Id. at 344-45\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “Summary . . . dismissals\nfor want of a substantial federal question . . . reject the spe-\ncific challenges presented in the statement of jurisdiction and\ndo leave undisturbed the judgment appealed from. They do\nprevent lower courts from coming to opposite conclusions on\nthe precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those\nactions.” Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173, 176 (1977) (per\ncuriam). Thus, “[a] summary disposition affirms only the\njudgment of the court below, and no more may be read into\n[the] action than was essential to sustain that judgment.” Ill.\nState Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S.\n173, 182-83 (1979) (citation omitted). “Questions which\n‘merely lurk in the record’ are not resolved, and no resolution\nof them may be inferred.” Id. at 183 (citation omitted).\n\n  The jurisdictional statements presented to the United States\nSupreme Court in Baker v. Nelson were as follows:\n\n    1. Whether appellee’s refusal to sanctify appel-\n    lants’ marriage deprives appellants of their liberty to\n    marry and of their property without due process of\n    law under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n    2.

BROWN                      1649\n    privacy under the Ninth and Fourteenth Amend-\n    ments.\n\nSee In re Kandu, 315 B.R. at 137.\n\n                              B.\n\n   Here, we must address whether the question before us\ninvolves “the precise issues presented and necessarily decided\nby” Baker v. Nelson, such that the Supreme Court’s summary\ndismissal would have precedential effect here. Alternatively,\nthe question before us could be one that “merely lurk[ed] in\nthe record” of Baker, and the present case would not be\nresolved by the Supreme Court’s summary dismissal.\n\n  In this case, the following issues were presented for review:\n\n    1. Whether [Proponents] have standing to appeal\n    the district court’s judgment.\n\n    2. Whether Proposition 8 violates the Due Process\n    Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n    States Constitution.\n\n    3. Whether Proposition 8 violates the Equal Pro-\n    tection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n    United States Constitution.\n\nPlaintiff-Intervenor City and County of San Francisco (here-\ninafter San Francisco) presented the following additional\nissue for review:\n\n    1. Whether Proposition 8, a constitutional amend-\n    ment adopted after a plebiscite campaign that played\n    on fears and prejudices about lesbians and gay men,\n    violates the Equal Protection Clause of the federal\n    Constitution where its effect is to remove the hon-\n    ored title “marriage” but not the incidents of mar-\n\f1650                        PERRY v. BROWN\n      riage from same-sex couples, and its purpose is to\n      remove the taint that its supporters believed the\n      inclusion of lesbian and gay couples worked on the\n      institution of marriage.\n\n   The equal protection question raised in this case seems to\nbe distinguishable from the precise issues presented and nec-\nessarily decided in Baker, especially when the equal protec-\ntion issue is framed as San Francisco advocates.1 The equal\nprotection issue decided in Baker rested on whether Minneso-\nta’s “refusal, pursuant to Minnesota marriage statutes, to sanc-\ntify appellants’ marriage . . . violates their rights under the\nequal protection clause . . . .” In re Kandu, 315 B.R. at 137.\nHere, San Francisco presents the issue of whether Proposition\n8’s effect of “remov[ing] the honored title ‘marriage’ but not\nthe incident of marriage from same-sex couples” violates\nequal protection. This Proposition 8 issue may have “merely\nlurk[ed] in the record” of Baker. Unlike Minnesota, California\ngranted same-sex couples rights to both the designation and\nthe incidents of marriage, before withdrawing the right of\naccess to the designation through Proposition 8. Therefore,\n  1\n    Whether prohibiting marriage by same-sex couples violates due pro-\ncess was an issue presented and decided in Baker v. Nelson. In this case,\nthe district court determined that “plaintiffs seek to exercise their funda-\nmental right to marry under the Due Process Clause,” Perry v. Schwar-\nzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 993 (N.D. Cal. 2010), and that Proposition\n8 violated the Due Process Clause, because it denied Plaintiffs this funda-\nmental right and did not withstand strict scrutiny. Id. at 994-95. But in\nBaker, the Minnesota Supreme Court determined that prohibiting marriage\nby same-sex couples did not offend the Due Process Clause. 191 N.W.3d\nat 186-87. Because the United States Supreme Court “branded [that] ques-\ntion as unsubstantial” in its summary dismissal, the due process issue “re-\nmains so except when doctrinal developments indicate otherwise.” Hicks\nv. Miranda, 422 U.S. at 344 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nUnited States Supreme Court cases following Baker do not suggest any\nsuch doctrinal developments have occurred. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas,\n539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003) (“[This case] does not involve whether the gov-\nernment must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual\npersons seek to enter.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1651\nthe constitutionality of withdrawing from same-sex couples\nthe right of access to the designation of marriage does not\nseem to be among the “specific challenges” raised in Baker.\nIf so, though the precedential effect of Baker v. Nelson is not\nchallenged by this decision, such precedent is distinguishable\nfrom the decision of the district court here.\n\n                               II.\n\n   In deciding this case, one should be mindful that generally\nstate governance over marriage is not challenged easily. How-\never, while “marriage is a social relation subject to the State’s\npolice power,” this does not mean that the State’s “powers to\nregulate marriage are unlimited notwithstanding the com-\nmands of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Loving v. Virginia,\n388 U.S. 1, 7 (1967). A marriage regulation “containing racial\nclassifications,” such as the one at issue in Loving, is subject\nto “the very heavy burden of justification which the Four-\nteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes\ndrawn according to race.” Id. at 9. However, not “every state\nregulation which relates in any way to the incidents of or pre-\nrequisites for marriage must be subjected to rigorous scruti-\nny.” Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 386 (majority opinion). Proposition\n8 does not involve such a suspect classification and therefore\nshould not be analyzed under any heightened scrutiny, but we\nmust still ask “whether there is any rational foundation for the\ndiscrimination[ ] . . . .” See Loving, 388 U.S. at 9.\n\n                               A.\n\n   The Plaintiffs, San Francisco, and their supporting amici\n(hereinafter Plaintiffs) challenge Proposition 8 under the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. How-\never, because Proposition 8 is “a classification neither involv-\ning fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines,”\nHeller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993), I do not address the\napplication of strict scrutiny review to Proposition 8. Under\nstrict scrutiny review, the government would need to establish\n\f1652                    PERRY v. BROWN\nthat the classification is necessary to achieve a compelling\ngovernmental interest, and there must not be a less onerous\navailable alternative. The United States Supreme Court has\nnot recognized that the fundamental right to marry includes a\nfundamental right to gay marriage. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n578. Gays and lesbians are not a suspect or quasi-suspect\nclass. High Tech Gays v. Def. Indus. Sec. Clearance Office,\n895 F.2d 563, 573 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n   I also do not address intermediate scrutiny because\nSupreme Court precedent thus far has never held that sexual\norientation is a “quasi-suspect classification.” See City of Cle-\nburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 441-42 (1985).\nUnder that standard of review, generally applied in illegiti-\nmacy and gender cases, the government would need to estab-\nlish that the classification is substantially related to an\nimportant governmental interest. See id. at 441.\n\n   Thus, Proposition 8 is subject to rational basis review rather\nthan to any heightened scrutiny. See id. at 440-42.\n\n                               B.\n\n   “The Fourteenth Amendment’s promise that no person\nshall be denied the equal protection of the laws must coexist\nwith the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for\none purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various\ngroups or persons.” Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631\n(1996). Thus, when assessing the constitutionality of most\ngovernment measures, we use rational basis review in an\nattempt “to reconcile the principle with the reality.” Id. Under\nrational basis review, “we will uphold the legislative classifi-\ncation so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate\nend.” Id.\n\n   In equal protection analysis, rational basis review “is not a\nlicense for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of\nlegislative choices.” Heller, 509 U.S. at 319 (internal quota-\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1653\ntion marks omitted). A classification “neither involving fun-\ndamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines is\naccorded a strong presumption of validity.” Id. “Such a classi-\nfication cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if\nthere is a rational relationship between the disparity of treat-\nment and some legitimate governmental purpose.” Id. at 320.\nThe government is not required to “actually articulate at any\ntime the purpose or rationale supporting its classification”;\nrather, a classification “must be upheld against equal protec-\ntion challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of\nfacts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.”\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   Additionally, the government “has no obligation to provide\nevidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classifica-\ntion.” Id. The measure at issue “is not subject to courtroom\nfactfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsup-\nported by evidence or empirical data.” Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “[T]he burden is on the one attacking the leg-\nislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis\nwhich might support it . . . .” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Further, a legislature’s generalizations may pass\nrational basis review “even when there is an imperfect fit\nbetween means and ends.” Id. at 321. In sum, the measure\nneed only have “arguable” assumptions underlying its “plau-\nsible rationales” to survive constitutional challenge. Id. at\n333.\n\n   However, “even the standard of rationality . . . must find\nsome footing in the realities of the subject addressed by the\nlegislation.” Id. at 321. Also, some interests are not legitimate\ngovernmental interests. E.g., Romer, 517 U.S. at 634 (stating\nthat “animosity toward the class of persons affected” is not a\nlegitimate governmental interest); Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448\n(stating that “mere negative attitudes, or fear” are not legiti-\nmate governmental interests); U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno,\n413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973) (stating that a “bare . . . desire to\n\f1654                    PERRY v. BROWN\nharm a politically unpopular group” is not a legitimate gov-\nernmental interest).\n\n   As a general rule, states may use their police power to regu-\nlate the “morals” of their population. See, e.g., Berman v. Par-\nker, 348 U.S. 26, 32 (1954). In his dissent in Lawrence, 539\nU.S. at 589-91 (Scalia, J., dissenting), Justice Scalia argued\nthat “[c]ountless judicial decisions and legislative enactments\nhave relied on the ancient proposition that a governing major-\nity’s belief that certain sexual behavior is ‘immoral and unac-\nceptable’ constitutes a rational basis for regulation.” Id. at\n589. He then suggested that the Supreme Court has relied on\nmorality as the basis for its decision making and states,\n“[s]tate laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest,\nprostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality,\nand obscenity are likewise sustainable only in light of valida-\ntion of laws based on moral choices.” Id. at 590.\n\n   However, Justice O’Connor articulated a different perspec-\ntive in determining whether moral disapproval may serve as\na rational basis for equal protection. She outlined that moral\ndisapproval is not a legitimate state interest to justify, by\nitself, a statute that bans homosexual conduct. She stated that\n“[m]oral disapproval of this group, like a bare desire to harm\nthe group, is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational\nbasis review under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 582\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). She continued: “Indeed, we have\nnever held that moral disapproval, without any other asserted\nstate interest, is a sufficient rationale under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause to justify a law that discriminates among groups\nof persons.” Id. The Lawrence majority opinion seems to have\nimplicitly agreed with Justice O’Connor, when it stated that\na court’s “obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to man-\ndate its own moral code.” Id. at 559 (majority opinion) (inter-\nnal quotation mark omitted).\n\n   Therefore, such interests (e.g., animus, negative attitudes,\nfear, a bare desire to harm, and moral disapproval) alone will\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1655\nnot support the constitutionality of a measure, because the\nEqual Protection Clause does not permit a “status-based\nenactment divorced from any factual context from which [the\ncourts] could discern a relationship to legitimate state inter-\nests,” or a “classification of persons undertaken for its own\nsake . . . .” Romer, 517 U.S. at 635.\n\n                              III.\n\n   The majority concludes that “Romer governs our analysis\nnotwithstanding the differences between Amendment 2 and\nProposition 8,” because of the similarities between the mea-\nsures at issue in Romer and in the present case. However, the\ndifferences between Amendment 2 and Proposition 8 indicate\nthat Romer does not directly control our analysis of the consti-\ntutionality of Proposition 8.\n\n   Before comparing Amendment 2 to Proposition 8, I want\nto attempt to clarify the extent of the Plaintiffs’ interest\nasserted here. One must understand the unique manner in\nwhich California defines this interest. Because the California\nSupreme Court defined and clarified that interest in its Strauss\nv. Horton opinion, I quote liberally from it.\n\n   Proposition 8 “properly must be understood as having a\nconsiderably narrower scope and more limited effect” than\nwhat might be the case in other states. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61.\n“Proposition 8 does not entirely repeal or abrogate the aspect\nof a same-sex couple’s state constitutional right to . . . choose\none’s life partner and enter with that person into a committed,\nofficially recognized, and protected family relationship that\nenjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage.”\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Nor does Proposition 8 fundamentally alter the\n    meaning and substance of state constitutional equal\n    protection principles . . . . Instead, the measure\n    carves out a narrow and limited exception to these\n\f1656                     PERRY v. BROWN\n      state constitutional rights, reserving the official des-\n      ignation of the term “marriage” for the union of\n      opposite-sex couples as a matter of state constitu-\n      tional law, but leaving undisturbed all of the other\n      extremely significant substantive aspects of a same-\n      sex couple’s state constitutional right to establish an\n      officially recognized and protected family relation-\n      ship and the guarantee of equal protection of the\n      laws.\n\nId.\n\n  Further, the California Supreme Court continued, “as a\nqualitative matter, the act of limiting access to the designation\nof marriage to opposite-sex couples [through Proposition 8]\ndoes not have a substantial or, indeed, even a minimal effect\non the governmental plan or framework of California that\nexisted prior to the amendment.” Id. at 62.\n\n   However, the California Supreme Court was also quick to\npoint out that this differentiation did not diminish or minimize\n“the significance of the official designation of ‘marriage,’ ”\nwhich they characterized as “a vital factor” in their prior deci-\nsion holding that failing to provide access to this designation\nto same-sex couples “impinged upon the privacy and due pro-\ncess rights of same-sex couples and violated those couples’\nright to the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the\nCalifornia Constitution.” Id. at 59, 61.\n\n   Therefore, “Proposition 8 reasonably must be interpreted in\na limited fashion as eliminating only the right of same-sex\ncouples to equal access to the designation of marriage, and as\nnot otherwise affecting the constitutional right of those cou-\nples to establish an officially recognized family relationship.”\nId. at 76.\n\n      Accordingly, although Proposition 8 eliminates the\n      ability of same-sex couples to enter into an official\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                       1657\n    relationship designated “marriage,” in all other\n    respects those couples continue to possess, under the\n    state constitutional privacy and due process clauses,\n    “the core set of basic substantive legal rights and\n    attributes traditionally associated with marriage,”\n    including, “most fundamentally, the opportunity of\n    an individual to establish—with the person with\n    whom the individual has chose to share his or her\n    life—an officially recognized and protected family\n    possessing mutual rights and responsibilities and\n    entitled to the same respect and dignity accorded a\n    union traditionally designated as marriage.” Like\n    opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples enjoy this\n    protection not as a matter of legislative grace, but of\n    constitutional right.\n\nId. at 77 (citation omitted).\n\n                                A.\n\n   In Romer, Colorado voters adopted Amendment 2 to the\nState Constitution, which “prohibits all legislative, executive,\nor judicial action at any level of state or local government\ndesigned to protect . . . gays and lesbians.’ ” 517 U.S. at 624.\nAmendment 2 was passed in response to municipal ordi-\nnances enacted in various Colorado cities that protected “per-\nsons discriminated against by reason of their sexual\norientation.” Id. The Supreme Court examined Amendment 2\nunder rational basis review, where “if a law neither burdens\na fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold\nthe legislative classification so long as it bears a rational rela-\ntion to some legitimate end.” Id. at 631. The Supreme Court\nheld that Amendment 2 failed rational basis review for two\nreasons. Id. at 632. “First, the amendment has the peculiar\nproperty of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability\non a single named group, an exceptional and . . . invalid form\nof legislation.” Id. “Second, its sheer breadth is so discontinu-\nous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems\n\f1658                     PERRY v. BROWN\ninexplicable by anything but animus toward the class if\naffects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state inter-\nests.” Id.\n\n                                B.\n\n   There are several ways to distinguish Romer from the pres-\nent case. First, in Romer, the Supreme Court stated that “[t]he\nchange Amendment 2 works in the legal status of gays and\nlesbians in the private sphere is far reaching, both on its own\nterms and when considered in light of the structure and opera-\ntion of modern anti-discrimination laws.” Id. at 627. Here,\n“Proposition 8 reasonably must be interpreted in a limited\nfashion as eliminating only the right of same-sex couples to\nequal access to the designation of marriage, and as not other-\nwise affecting the constitutional right of those couples to\nestablish an officially recognized family relationship.”\nStrauss, 207 P.3d at 76. Thus, Romer is inapposite, because\nProposition 8 eliminates the right of access to the designation\nof marriage from same-sex couples, rather than working a far\nreaching change in their legal status.\n\n   Second, Amendment 2’s “sheer breadth is so discontinuous\nwith the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inex-\nplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects.”\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 632. Again, Proposition 8 “carves out a\nnarrow and limited exception to [the] state constitutional\nrights” of privacy and due process. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61.\nProposition 8 therefore lacks the “sheer breadth” that\nprompted the Supreme Court to raise the inference of animus\nin Romer.\n\n   The effect of animus is also unclear. In Romer, the\nSupreme Court stated that “laws of the kind now before us\nraise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is\nborn of animosity towards the class of persons affected.” 517\nU.S. at 634. The Supreme Court indicated that Amendment 2\nwas constitutionally invalid, because its only purpose was ani-\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                     1659\nmus; Amendment 2 was not “directed to any identifiable\nlegitimate purpose or discrete objective.” Id. at 635. In short,\nRomer was a case where the only basis for the measure at\nissue was animus. However, in a case where the measure at\nissue was prompted both by animus and by some independent\nlegitimate purpose, the measure may still be constitutionally\nvalid. The Supreme Court has stated that while “negative atti-\ntudes,” “fear” or other biases “may often accompany irratio-\nnal (and therefore unconstitutional) discrimination, their\npresence alone does not a constitutional violation make.” Bd.\nof Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 367\n(2001) (discussing Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448). If “animus” is\none such bias, its presence alone may not make Proposition\n8 invalid if the measure also rationally relates to a legitimate\ngovernmental interest.\n\n   Finally, gays and lesbians were burdened by Amendment 2,\nbecause it “operate[d] to repeal and forbid all laws or policies\nproviding specific protection for gays or lesbians from dis-\ncrimination by every level of Colorado government.” Romer,\n517 U.S. at 629. In contrast, “although Proposition 8 elimi-\nnates the ability of same-sex couples to enter into an official\nrelationship designated ‘marriage,’ in all other respects those\ncouples continue to possess, under the state constitutional pri-\nvacy and due process clauses, the core set of basic substantive\nlegal rights and attributes traditionally associated with mar-\nriage . . . .” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 77 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Put otherwise, Proposition 8 does not burden gays\nand lesbians to the same extent Amendment 2 burdened gays\nand lesbians in Colorado.\n\n                              C.\n\n   Proponents argue that the fact that Proposition 8 withdrew\nfrom same-sex couples the existing right of access to the des-\nignation of marriage should be significant in our constitu-\ntional analysis. However, Supreme Court equal protection\ncases involving challenges to measures withdrawing an exist-\n\f1660                         PERRY v. BROWN\ning right do not indicate that the withdrawal should affect our\nanalysis. Instead, it seems that the court has upheld legislation\nthat withdraws, rather than reserves, some legal right. E.g.,\nU.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 176-77 (1980)\n(applying “traditional” principles of rational basis review to\nCongress’s determination “that some of those who in the past\nreceived full windfall benefits would not continue to do so”);\nCity of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303-05 (1976)\n(per curiam) (concluding that city’s elimination of rights of\nsome pushcart food vendors, but not others, was “not consti-\ntutionally impermissible”). In fact, in its decision in Romer,\nthe Supreme Court does not base its decision on this conten-\ntion. Rather, it mentioned withdrawing specific legal protec-\ntions from gays and lesbians only in the context of referring\nto the irrational targeting of that group when compared to the\nsweeping change Amendment 2 created in the law.2 Romer,\n517 U.S. at 627.\n\n                                     D.\n\n   The above differences between Amendment 2 and Proposi-\ntion 8 indicate that Romer does not directly control here. In\nRomer, the Supreme Court found that animus alone was the\npurpose behind Amendment 2. Here, the majority backs into\nits inference of animus, first determining that all other bases\n   2\n     However, while the withdrawal of a right may not be analytically sig-\nnificant for rational basis review, it may still be factually significant. For\nexample, the fact that Proposition 8 involves the withdrawal of an existing\nright and not the extension of a previously reserved right suggests that\nJohnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361 (1974), is inapposite to the present case.\nIn Johnson, the Supreme Court declared that “[w]hen . . . the inclusion of\none group promotes a legitimate governmental purpose, and the addition\nof other groups would not, we cannot say that the statute’s classification\nof beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries is invidiously discriminatory.” Id. at\n383. As the majority argues, the rule from Johnson appears to be inappli-\ncable here, because Proposition 8 involves the withdrawal from same-sex\ncouples of the existing right to access the designation of marriage, and not\nthe addition of same-sex couples to the group previously reserved the\nright.\n\f                       PERRY v. BROWN                     1661\nfor Proposition 8 are constitutionally invalid. Assuming ani-\nmus or moral disapproval were one of the purposes of Propo-\nsition 8, the measure would still survive rational basis review\nif there were also a valid rational basis behind Proposition 8.\nOnly if there were no other basis would Proposition 8 fail\nrational basis review. Thus, our task is to determine whether\nProposition 8 rationally relates to any independent legitimate\ngovernmental interest.\n\n                             IV.\n\n   In our case, Proponents argue that Proposition 8, defining\nmarriage as the union of one man and one woman, is ratio-\nnally related to a legitimate governmental interest for several\nreasons. Some of those reasons have already been discussed\nin the majority opinion and need no further discussion here.\nHowever, two of those reasons deserve more discussion,\nbecause they have been credited by other courts: (1) a respon-\nsible procreation theory, justifying the inducement of marital\nrecognition only for opposite-sex couples, because it “steers\nprocreation into marriage” because opposite-sex couples are\nthe only couples who can procreate children accidentally or\nirresponsibly; and (2) an optimal parenting theory, justifying\nthe inducement of marital recognition only for opposite-sex\ncouples, because the family structure of two committed bio-\nlogical parents—one man and one woman—is the optimal\npartnership for raising children. See, e.g., Citizens for Equal\nProtection, 455 F.3d at 867-68.\n\n                              A.\n\n   Proponents argue that Proposition 8, defining marriage as\nthe union of one man and one woman, preserves the funda-\nmental and historical purposes of marriage. They argue that,\nif the definition of marriage between a man and a woman is\nchanged, it would fundamentally redefine the term from its\noriginal and historical procreative purpose. This shift in pur-\npose would weaken society’s perception of the importance of\n\f1662                        PERRY v. BROWN\nentering into marriage to have children, which would increase\nthe likelihood that couples would choose to cohabitate rather\nthan to get married. They also argue that irresponsible procre-\nation, by accident or willfully in a cohabitation relationship,\nwill result in less stable circumstances for children and that\nsame-sex couples do not present this threat of irresponsible\nprocreation. They argue that, in the case of unintended preg-\nnancies, the question is not whether the child will be raised by\ntwo opposite-sex parents, but rather whether it will be raised,\non the one hand by two parents, or on the other hand by its\nmother alone (often with the assistance of the state). “Proposi-\ntion 8 seeks to channel potentially procreative conduct into\nrelationships where that conduct is likely to further, rather\nthan harm, society’s interest in responsible procreation and\nchildrearing.”\n\n   Proponents also argue the “optimal parenting” rationale\nserves as a rational basis for Proposition 8. The optimal par-\nenting rationale posits that Proposition 8 promotes the optimal\nsetting for the responsible raising and care of children—by\ntheir biological parents in a stable marriage relationship. Pro-\nponents offer many judicial decisions and secondary authori-\nties supporting both rationales.\n\n   In sum, Proponents argue that Proposition 8 is rationally\nrelated to legitimate governmental interests.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   The first requirement of rational basis review is that there\nmust be some conceivable legitimate governmental interest\nfor the measure at issue.3\n  3\n   This requirement is easily met, because “[v]irtually any goal that is not\nforbidden by the Constitution will be deemed sufficient to meet the ratio-\nnal basis test.” Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and\nPolicies 698 (4th ed. 2011).\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                          1663\n                               1.\n\n  The California Supreme Court indicated that responsible\nprocreation is a legitimate governmental interest:\n\n    Whether or not the state’s interest in encouraging\n    responsible procreation properly can be viewed as a\n    reasonably conceivable justification for the statutory\n    limitation of marriage to a man and a woman for\n    purposes of the rational basis equal protection stan-\n    dard, this interest clearly does not provide an appro-\n    priate basis for defining or limiting the scope of the\n    constitutional right to marry. . . . [A]lthough the state\n    undeniably has a legitimate interest in promoting\n    “responsible procreation,” that interest cannot be\n    viewed as a valid basis for defining or limiting the\n    class of persons who may claim the protection of the\n    fundamental constitutional right to marry.\n\nIn re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 432 (Cal. 2008) (empha-\nsis added), superseded by constitutional amendment as stated\nin Strauss, 207 P.3d 48.\n\n                               2.\n\n   With regard to the optimal parenting rationale, the Califor-\nnia Supreme Court stated the following about “the state’s\ninterest in fostering a favorable environment for the procre-\nation and raising of children”:\n\n    [A]lthough promoting and facilitating a stable envi-\n    ronment for the procreation and raising of children\n    is unquestionably one of the vitally important pur-\n    poses underlying the institution of marriage and the\n    constitutional right to marry, past cases make clear\n    that this right is not confined to, or restrictively\n    defined by, that purpose alone. As noted above, our\n    past cases have recognized that the right to marry is\n\f1664                         PERRY v. BROWN\n     the right to enter into a relationship that is the center\n     of the personal affections that ennoble and enrich\n     human life—a relationship that is at once the most\n     socially productive and individually fulfilling rela-\n     tionship that one can enjoy in the course of a life-\n     time. The personal enrichment afforded by the right\n     to marry may be obtained by a couple whether or not\n     they choose to have children, and the right to marry\n     never has been limited to those who plan or desire to\n     have children. . . . [T]he state constitutional right to\n     marry . . . cannot properly be defined by or limited\n     to the state’s interest in fostering a favorable envi-\n     ronment for the procreation and raising of children.\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 432 (citations and internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). Thus, the California Supreme Court\ndiscussed “the state’s interest in fostering a favorable environ-\nment for the protection and raising of children” without using\nthe “legitimate interest” and “for the purposes of the rational\nbasis equal protection standard” language used to discuss “re-\nsponsible procreation.” See id.\n\n                                     a.\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that the optimal parenting rationale cannot\nbe a legitimate governmental interest because same-sex cou-\nples in domestic partnerships have all the substantive parent-\ning rights opposite-sex couples in marriages enjoy.\nAdditionally, California family law does not give any official\npreferences to opposite-sex parents.4 Proposition 8 did not\n   4\n     For example, “[t]he rights and obligations of registered domestic part-\nners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those\nof spouses.” Cal. Fam. Code § 297.5(d). Also, “[i]t is the policy of this\nstate that all persons engaged in providing care and services to foster chil-\ndren . . . shall not be subjected to discrimination or harassment on the\nbasis of their clients’ or their own actual or perceived . . . sexual orienta-\ntion . . . .” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16013(a). Further, “[t]he parent and\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                             1665\nchange this factual situation, because it “leav[es] undisturbed\n. . . a same-sex couple’s state constitutional right to establish\nan officially recognized and protected family relationship and\nthe guarantee of equal protection of the laws.” Strauss, 207\nP.3d at 61. “This state’s current policies and conduct regard-\ning homosexuality . . . recognize that gay individuals are fully\ncapable of entering into the kind of loving and enduring com-\nmitted relationships that may serve as the foundation of a\nfamily and of responsibly caring for and raising children.”\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 428.\n\n   The parties argue about whether this analysis subjects Prop-\nosition 8 to heightened scrutiny rather than rational basis\nreview. In my view, while Plaintiffs may give a correct\naccounting of California law, it does not necessarily follow\nthat the optimal parenting rationale is an illegitimate govern-\nmental interest, because it contradicts existing laws on parent-\ning and the family. For example, a posited reason offered by\none lawmaking body after being rejected by another lawmak-\ning body can “provide[ ] a conceivable basis” for a measure.\nFCC v. Beach Comm’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 318 (1993). In\nBeach Communications, the Supreme Court accepted a pos-\nited reason for a federal agency regulation, even though Con-\ngress had previously rejected that purpose and the regulation\npresented a conflict in the statutory scheme.5 Id. Thus, even\n\nchild relationship extends equally to every child and to every parent,\nregardless of the marital status of the parents.” Cal. Fam. Code § 7602.\nThis legal structure is reinforced by the equal status of gays and lesbians\nin other areas of California’s laws, such as in antidiscrimination protec-\ntions regarding business establishments. E.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b) (“All\npersons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no mat-\nter what their . . . sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal\naccommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all busi-\nness establishments of every kind whatsoever.”).\n   5\n     See also City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 26-28 (1989) (stating\nthat a city could rationally impose an age and time restriction on dance\nhalls, even if it had not imposed similar restrictions on other premises\nwhere teenagers and adults congregated together; arguments focusing on\nthe inconsistency between the classification and the “interests and objec-\ntives” of the city “misapprehend[ed] the nature of rational-basis scrutiny”).\n\f1666                    PERRY v. BROWN\nif California’s legislature previously rejected the optimal par-\nenting rationale in its parenting laws (and Proposition 8 is\ninconsistent with its statutory scheme), that does not prevent\nthe people of California from adopting Proposition 8 under\nthat rationale.\n\n                               b.\n\n   In Heller, the Supreme Court stated that “legislative choice\nis not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on\nrational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical\ndata.” 509 U.S. at 320 (citations omitted). However, the\nSupreme Court went on to state that “even the standard of\nrationality as we so often have defined it must find some foot-\ning in the realities of the subject addressed by the legislation.”\nId. at 321.\n\n   Under rational basis review, the challenger has the burden\nto “negative every conceivable basis which might support”\nthe measure. Id. at 320. In light of this burden, Plaintiffs have\noffered many secondary authorities to support their argument\nthat the optimal parenting rationale cannot be a legitimate\ngovernmental interest. “Against [a] background of more than\n100 peer-reviewed studies, the State of California could not\nreasonably accept as a true—or even debatable—statement of\nfact Proponents’ view that only opposite-sex couples can\ncreate an ‘ideal’ childrearing environment.” Thus, “[i]t is not\nan end that the State rationally could adopt as its own and\ntherefore cannot sustain Proposition 8.”\n\n   Although Proponents were not required to put on any evi-\ndence under rational basis review, they also produced evi-\ndence. They argue that their evidence shows that married\nbiological parents are the optimal parenting structure. Further,\nthey argue “Plaintiffs fail to cite to a single study comparing\noutcomes for the children of married biological parents and\nthose of same-sex parents. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to\nundermine, let alone remove ‘from debate,’ the studies show-\n\f                              PERRY v. BROWN                            1667\ning that married biological parents provide the best structure\nfor raising children.”\n\n   After review, both sides offer evidence in support of their\nviews on whether the optimal parenting rationale is a legiti-\nmate governmental interest. Both sides also offer evidence to\nundermine the evidence presented by their opponents. How-\never, the standard only requires that the optimal parenting\nrationale be based on “rational speculation” about married\nbiological parents being the best for children. Heller, 509 U.S.\nat 320. Considering “the question is at least debatable,” id. at\n326 (internal quotation marks omitted), the optimal parenting\nrationale could conceivably be a legitimate governmental inter-\nest.6\n\n                                      C.\n\n   Having a conceivable legitimate governmental interest is,\nalone, not sufficient for rational basis review. To survive\nrational basis review, a measure must also have a rational\nrelationship to the posited legitimate governmental interest. In\ndetermining whether there is a rational relationship, one\nshould bear in mind “the nature of rational-basis scrutiny,\nwhich is the most relaxed and tolerant form of judicial scru-\n  6\n   In Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, Justice O’Connor relied on the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause to invalidate a state law\ncriminalizing homosexual sodomy. In her concurring opinion, she stated:\n      That this law as applied to private, consensual conduct is uncon-\n      stitutional under the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that\n      other laws distinguishing between heterosexuals and homosexu-\n      als would similarly fail under rational basis review. Texas cannot\n      assert any legitimate state interest here, such as national security\n      or preserving the traditional institution of marriage. Unlike the\n      moral disapproval of same-sex relations—the asserted state inter-\n      est in this case—other reasons exist to promote the institution of\n      marriage beyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group.\nId. at 585 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\f1668                         PERRY v. BROWN\ntiny under the Equal Protection Clause.”7 Dallas, 490 U.S. at\n26.\n\n                                     1.\n\n  The Eighth Circuit credited the responsible procreation and\noptimal parenting rationales in Citizens for Equal Protection,\nwhere Nebraska had enacted a constitutional amendment pro-\nhibiting recognition of marriages by same-sex couples and\nother official same-sex relationships:\n\n     The State argues that the many laws defining mar-\n     riage as the union of one man and one woman and\n     extending a variety of benefits to married couples are\n     rationally related to the government interest in\n     “steering procreation into marriage.” By affording\n     legal recognition and a basket of rights and benefits\n     to married heterosexual couples, such laws “encour-\n     age procreation to take place within the socially rec-\n     ognized unit that is best situated for raising\n     children.” . . . The argument is based in part on the\n     traditional notion that two committed heterosexuals\n     are the optimal partnership for raising children,\n     which modern-day homosexual parents understand-\n     ably decry. But it is also based on a “responsible\n     procreation” theory that justifies conferring the\n     inducements of marital recognition and benefits on\n     opposite-sex couples, who can otherwise produce\n     children by accident, but not on same-sex couples,\n     who cannot. Whatever our personal views regarding\n     this political and sociological debate, we cannot con-\n     clude that the State’s justification “lacks a rational\n     relationship to legitimate state interests.”\n   7\n     As explained above, this requirement is not a high bar. Indeed, “the\nclassification at issue need not be correlated in fact, even in relation to an\nassumed purpose for which there need not be any evidence.” Robert C.\nFarrell, The Two Versions of Rational-Basis Review and Same-Sex Rela-\ntionships, 86 Wash. L. Rev. 281, 290 (2011).\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1669\n455 F.3d at 867-68 (citations omitted).\n\n    The factual context in California is distinguishable from the\none the Eighth Circuit faced in Nebraska. Unlike the\nNebraska constitutional amendment, which prohibited the rec-\nognition of both marriages by same-sex couples and other\nsame-sex relationships, Proposition 8 left California’s existing\ndomestic partnership laws intact. In California, same-sex cou-\nples in domestic partnerships still enjoy the same substantive\nrights and benefits as opposite-sex couples in marriages.\nThus, it cannot be said that Proposition 8 “confer[s] the\ninducements of marital . . . benefits on opposite-sex couples\n. . . , but not on same-sex couples . . . .” See id. at 867. How-\never, this distinction may not be dispositive, because the\nEighth Circuit was considering both the substantive legal ben-\nefits as well as the designation of marriage.\n\n                               2.\n\n   That leaves the question of whether withdrawing from\nsame-sex couples the right to access the designation of mar-\nriage, alone, rationally relates to the responsible procreation\nand optimal parenting rationales.\n\n                               a.\n\n   Regarding the responsible procreation rationale, Plaintiffs\nargue that Proponents suggest no reason to believe prohibiting\nsame-sex couples from entering relationships designated\n“marriage” will make it more likely that opposite-sex couples\nin California will marry. Put differently, Plaintiffs argue that,\nbecause Proposition 8 does not bestow an honor on opposite-\nsex couples but instead withdraws an honor from same-sex\ncouples, the responsible procreation rationale could be cred-\nited only if it is rational to believe that opposite-sex couples\nwill be less likely to raise children in a marital family if the\nstature of marriage is also available to same-sex couples. Fur-\nther, Plaintiffs argue that Proponents’ failure to describe how\n\f1670                    PERRY v. BROWN\nProposition 8 rationally relates to the responsible procreation\nrationale indicates that the rationale lacks the required “foot-\ning in the realities of the subject addressed by the legislation.”\nHeller, 509 U.S. at 321.\n\n   In response, Proponents argue that, “[b]ecause only sexual\nrelationships between men and woman can produce children,\nsuch relationships have the potential to further—or harm—\nthis interest in a way that other types of relationships do not.”\nThus, “it follows that the commonsense distinction that our\nlaw has always drawn between opposite-sex couples, on the\none hand, and all other types of relationships—including\nsame-sex couples—on the other hand, plainly bears a rational\nrelationship to the government interest in steering procreation\ninto marriage.”\n\n   However, Proposition 8 is not a “distinction that [Califor-\nnia] law has always drawn,” because it “establishes a new\nsubstantive state constitutional rule that became effective\nonce Proposition 8 was approved by the voters.” Strauss, 207\nP.3d at 115. Also,\n\n    [n]one of the past cases discussing the right to marry\n    —and identifying this right as one of the fundamen-\n    tal elements of personal autonomy and liberty pro-\n    tected by our Constitution—contains any suggestion\n    that the constitutional right to marry is possessed\n    only by individuals who are at risk of producing\n    children accidentally, or implies that this constitu-\n    tional right is not equally important for and guaran-\n    teed to responsible individuals who can be counted\n    upon to take appropriate precautions in planning for\n    parenthood.\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 432. In this particular context,\nthe fact that Proposition 8 established a new rule, instead of\ncontinuing a “distinction that [California] law has always\ndrawn,” weakens Proponents’ argument that Proposition 8\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                     1671\n“plainly bears a rational relationship” to the responsible pro-\ncreation rationale.\n\n                              b.\n\n   Regarding the optimal parenting rationale, Plaintiffs argue\nthat, because Proposition 8 does not change California’s sub-\nstantive laws governing childraising, procreation, or the fam-\nily structure, Proposition 8 cannot be rationally related to the\noptimal parenting rationale. To channel more childrearing into\nfamilies led by married biological parents, they argue that\nProposition 8 would have had to change those laws somehow.\nRather, Proposition 8 only singles out gays and lesbians, as a\ngroup, as inferior.\n\n   Proponents contend that this argument subjects Proposition\n8 to heightened scrutiny review, and that the standard for\nrational basis review does not require the classification be\nsubstantially related to an important governmental interest.\nInstead, for rational basis review, the classification must only\n(1) serve some conceivable governmental interest; (2) have a\nplausible reason for the enactment; (3) remain debatable; and\n(4) not be totally arbitrary. Their argument continues that, in\nCalifornia’s unique context, Proposition 8 only deals with the\ndesignation of the term “marriage” but leaves undisturbed all\nof the other significant substantive aspects of recognized and\nprotected family relationships. Proponents’ theory only\nincreases the likelihood that children are born and raised in a\nfamily structure of biological parents by encouraging such\nparents to marry; the designation of marriage for only that\nunion would make it more likely that opposite-sex couples\nwill want to enter into marriage and then subsequently raise\ntheir own biological offspring, rather than implying that any\nother union could not be good parents. Proponents claim this\ninterest does not depend on any judgment about the relative\nparenting capabilities of opposite-sex and same-sex couples;\nit only confirms the instinctive, commonsense belief that mar-\nried biological parents provide the optimal environment for\n\f1672                         PERRY v. BROWN\nraising children. Lastly, they argue there can be no require-\nment of narrow tailoring where there would be a perfect fit\nwith the governmental interest and the law. If the state denied\nsame-sex couples significant benefits under the law, the law\nwould be more likely to fail equal protection by denying\nimportant government rights, thus increasing the burden of\nthe test.\n\n                                     3.\n\n   “[C]ourts are compelled under rational-basis review to\naccept a legislature’s generalizations even when there is an\nimperfect fit between means and ends.” Heller, 509 U.S. at\n321. Here, the people of California might have believed that\nwithdrawing from same-sex couples the right to access the\ndesignation of marriage would, arguably, further the interests\nin promoting responsible procreation and optimal parenting.\n“The assumptions underlying these rationales may be errone-\nous, but the very fact that they are ‘arguable’ is sufficient, on\nrational-basis review, to ‘immuniz[e]’ the congressional\nchoice from constitutional challenge.” Beach Commc’ns, 508\nU.S. at 320 (alteration in original).\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that Proposition 8 could only advance the\noffered rationales through encouraging opposite-sex couples\nto marry, who otherwise would not marry because they disap-\nprove of same-sex couples having the right of access to the\ndesignation of marriage and the stature that comes with the\ndesignation. Therefore, Proposition 8 impermissibly gives\neffect to those “private biases.” See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466\nU.S. 429, 433 (1984). However, Supreme Court precedent\ndoes not suggest that a measure is invalid under rational basis\nreview simply because the means by which its purpose is\naccomplished rest on such biases.8 Rather, precedent indicates\n  8\n   In Palmore, the Supreme Court stated that “[p]rivate biases may be\noutside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give\nthem effect.” 466 U.S. at 433. Even if Palmore indicates that giving effect\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                           1673\nthat such biases invalidate a measure if they are the only con-\nceivable ends for the measure. See, e.g., Romer, 517 U.S. at\n535. Again, in determining whether there is a rational rela-\ntionship, one must bear in mind that rational basis review “is\nthe most relaxed and tolerant form of judicial scrutiny under\nthe Equal Protection Clause.” Dallas, 490 U.S. at 26. Thus, I\ncannot conclude that Proposition 8 is “wholly irrelevant” to\nany legitimate governmental interests. Heller, 509 U.S. at 324\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                    V.\n\n   Given the presumption of validity accorded Proposition 8\nfor rational basis review, I am not convinced that Proposition\n8 lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests. Pre-\ncedent evidences extreme judicial restraint in applying ratio-\nnal basis review to equal protection cases.\n\n     Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle\n     of judicial review of legislation is it possible to pre-\n     serve to the legislative branch its rightful indepen-\n     dence and its ability to function. . . . [R]estraints on\n     judicial review have added force where the legisla-\n     ture must necessarily engage in a process of line-\n     drawing. Defining the class of persons subject . . .\n     inevitably requires that some persons who have an\n\nto private biases through means is illegitimate, it is a case where “ac-\nknowledged racial prejudice [was] invoked to justify [a] racial classifica-\ntion[ ].” Id. Thus, the classification came under strict scrutiny. Id. at\n432-33; see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 520\n(1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (“The benign purpose of\ncompensating for social disadvantages . . . can no more be pursued by the\nillegitimate means of racial discrimination than can other assertedly\nbenign purposes we have repeatedly rejected.”).\n   While the Supreme Court quoted Palmore in Cleburne, it did so in the\ncontext of rejecting “mere negative attitudes” or “fear” as ends. 473 U.S.\nat 448.\n\f1674                    PERRY v. BROWN\n    almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be\n    placed on different sides of the line, and the fact that\n    the line might have been drawn differently at some\n    points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial,\n    consideration.\n\nBeach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 315-16 (alteration, citations,\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the judiciary\nfaces a conspicuous limit on our judicial role in applying\nequal protection to legislative enactments, because\n\n    [t]he Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment\n    permits States a wide scope of discretion in enacting\n    laws which affect some groups of citizens differently\n    than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended\n    only if classification rests on grounds wholly irrele-\n    vant to the achievement of the State’s objective.\n    State legislatures are presumed to have acted within\n    their constitutional power despite the fact that, in\n    practice, their laws result in some inequality. A stat-\n    utory discrimination will not be set aside if any state\n    of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\n\nMcGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425-26 (1961). A law\nmust be upheld unless the government’s judgment “is ‘clearly\nwrong, a display of arbitrary power, [or] not an exercise of\njudgment.’ ” Mathews v. DeCastro, 429 U.S. 181, 185 (1976).\n\n   Applying rational basis review in these circumstances also\nrequires such restraint. As the Eighth Circuit said, in Citizens\nfor Equal Protection, 455 F.3d at 870:\n\n    In the nearly one hundred and fifty years since the\n    Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, to our knowl-\n    edge no Justice of the Supreme Court has suggested\n    that a state statute or constitutional provision codify-\n    ing the traditional definition of marriage violates the\n    Equal Protection Clause or any other provision of the\n\f                   PERRY v. BROWN                        1675\nUnited States Constitution. Indeed, in Baker v. Nel-\nson, . . . when faced with a Fourteenth Amendment\nchallenge to a decision by the Supreme Court of\nMinnesota denying a marriage license to a same-sex\ncouple, the United States Supreme Court dismissed\n“for want of a substantial federal question.” There is\ngood reason for this restraint.\n\f",

On that day, the People of California\nadopted Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution\nto eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. We con-\nsider whether that amendment violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. We conclude\nthat it does.\n\n   Although the Constitution permits communities to enact\nmost laws they believe to be desirable, it requires that there\nbe at least a legitimate reason for the passage of a law that\ntreats different classes of people differently. There was no\nsuch reason that Proposition 8 could have been enacted.\nBecause under California statutory law, same-sex couples had\nall the rights of opposite-sex couples, regardless of their mari-\ntal status, all parties agree that Proposition 8 had one effect\nonly. It stripped same-sex couples of the ability they previ-\nously possessed to obtain from the State, or any other autho-\nrized party, an important right—the right to obtain and use the\ndesignation of ‘marriage’ to describe their relationships.\nNothing more, nothing less. Proposition 8 therefore could not\nhave been enacted to advance California’s interests in child-\nrearing or responsible procreation, for it had no effect on the\n\f1588                    PERRY v. BROWN\nrights of same-sex couples to raise children or on the procre-\native practices of other couples. Nor did Proposition 8 have\nany effect on religious freedom or on parents’ rights to control\ntheir children’s education; it could not have been enacted to\nsafeguard these liberties.\n\n   All that Proposition 8 accomplished was to take away from\nsame-sex couples the right to be granted marriage licenses\nand thus legally to use the designation of ‘marriage,’ which\nsymbolizes state legitimization and societal recognition of\ntheir committed relationships. Proposition 8 serves no pur-\npose, and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and\nhuman dignity of gays and lesbians in California, and to offi-\ncially reclassify their relationships and families as inferior to\nthose of opposite-sex couples. The Constitution simply does\nnot allow for “laws of this sort.” Romer v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633 (1996).\n\n   “Broader issues have been urged for our consideration, but\nwe adhere to the principle of deciding constitutional questions\nonly in the context of the particular case before the Court.”\nSweatt v.

Whether under\nthe Constitution same-sex couples may ever be denied the\nright to marry, a right that has long been enjoyed by opposite-\nsex couples, is an important and highly controversial question.\nIt is currently a matter of great debate in our nation, and an\nissue over which people of good will may disagree, some-\ntimes strongly. Of course, when questions of constitutional\nlaw are necessary to the resolution of a case, courts may not\nand should not abstain from deciding them simply because\nthey are controversial. We need not and do not answer the\nbroader question in this case, however, because California had\nalready extended to committed same-sex couples both the\nincidents of marriage and the official designation of ‘mar-\nriage,’ and Proposition 8’s only effect was to take away that\nimportant and legally significant designation, while leaving in\nplace all of its incidents. This unique and strictly limited\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1589\neffect of Proposition 8 allows us to address the amendment’s\nconstitutionality on narrow grounds.\n\n   Thus, as a result of our “traditional reluctance to extend\nconstitutional interpretations to situations or facts which are\nnot before the Court, much of the excellent research and\ndetailed argument presented in th[is] case[ ] is unnecessary to\n[its] disposition.” Id. Were we unable, however, to resolve the\nmatter on the basis we do, we would not hesitate to proceed\nto the broader question—the constitutionality of denying\nsame-sex couples the right to marry.\n\n   Before considering the constitutional question of the valid-\nity of Proposition 8’s elimination of the rights of same-sex\ncouples to marry, we first decide that the official sponsors of\nProposition 8 are entitled to appeal the decision below, which\ndeclared the measure unconstitutional and enjoined its\nenforcement. The California Constitution and Elections Code\nendow the official sponsors of an initiative measure with the\nauthority to represent the State’s interest in establishing the\nvalidity of a measure enacted by the voters, when the State’s\nelected leaders refuse to do so. See Perry v. Brown, 134 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 499 (2011). It is for the State of California to decide\nwho may assert its interests in litigation, and we respect its\ndecision by holding that Proposition 8’s proponents have\nstanding to bring this appeal on behalf of the State. We there-\nfore conclude that, through the proponents of ballot measures,\nthe People of California must be allowed to defend in federal\ncourts, including on appeal, the validity of their use of the ini-\ntiative power. Here, however, their defense fails on the merits.\nThe People may not employ the initiative power to single out\na disfavored group for unequal treatment and strip them, with-\nout a legitimate justification, of a right as important as the\nright to marry. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n   We also affirm—for substantially the reasons set forth in\nthe district court’s opinion—the denial of the motion by the\n\f1590                    PERRY v. BROWN\nofficial sponsors of Proposition 8 to vacate the judgment\nentered by former Chief Judge Walker, on the basis of his\npurported interest in being allowed to marry his same-sex\npartner.\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Upon its founding, the State of California recognized the\nlegal institution of civil marriage for its residents. See, e.g.,\nCal. Const. of 1849, art. XI, §§ 12, 14 (discussing marriage\ncontracts and marital property); Cal. Stats. 1850, ch. 140 (“An\nAct regulating Marriages”). Marriage in California was under-\nstood, at the time and well into the twentieth century, to be\nlimited to relationships between a man and a woman. See In\nre Marriage Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 407-09 (Cal. 2008). In\n1977, that much was made explicit by the California Legisla-\nture, which amended the marriage statute to read, “Marriage\nis a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between\na man and a woman, to which the consent of the parties capa-\nble of making that contract is necessary.” Cal. Stats. 1977, ch.\n339, § 1. The 1977 provision remains codified in California\nstatute. See Cal. Fam. Code § 300(a).\n\n   Following the enactment of the Defense of Marriage Act of\n1996, Pub. L. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419 (codified in relevant\npart at 1 U.S.C. § 7), which expressly limited the federal defi-\nnition of marriage to relationships between one man and one\nwoman, dozens of states enacted similar provisions into state\nlaw. See Andrew Koppelman, The Difference the Mini-\nDOMAs Make, 38 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. 265, 265-66 (2007). Cali-\nfornia did so in 2000 by adopting Proposition 22, an initiative\nstatute, which provided, “Only marriage between a man and\na woman is valid or recognized in California.” Cal. Fam.\nCode § 308.5. The proposition ensured that same-sex mar-\nriages performed in any state that might permit such mar-\nriages in the future would not be recognized in California, and\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                        1591\nit guaranteed that any legislative repeal of the 1977 statute\nwould not allow same-sex couples to marry within the State,\nbecause the Legislature may not amend or repeal an initiative\nstatute enacted by the People. See Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d\nat 409-10.\n\n   Meanwhile, however, California had created the designa-\ntion “domestic partnership” for “two adults who have chosen\nto share one another’s lives in an intimate and committed rela-\ntionship of mutual caring.” Cal. Stats. 1999, ch. 588, § 2 (cod-\nified at Cal. Fam. Code § 297(a)). At first, California gave\nregistered domestic partners only limited rights, such as hos-\npital visitation privileges, id. § 4, and health benefits for the\ndomestic partners of certain state employees, id. § 3. Over the\nnext several years, however, the State substantially expanded\nthe rights of domestic partners. By 2008, “California statutory\nprovisions generally afford[ed] same-sex couples the opportu-\nnity to . . . obtain virtually all of the benefits and responsibili-\nties afforded by California law to married opposite-sex\ncouples.” Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 417-18. The 2003\nDomestic Partner Act provided broadly: “Registered domestic\npartners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits,\nand shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations,\nand duties under law, whether they derive from statutes,\nadministrative regulations, court rules, government policies,\ncommon law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are\ngranted to and imposed upon spouses.” Cal. Stats. 2003, ch.\n421, § 4 (codified at Cal. Fam. Code § 297.5(a)). It withheld\nonly the official designation of marriage and thus the offi-\ncially conferred and societally recognized status that accom-\npanies that designation.\n\n                                 B\n\n   In 2004, same-sex couples and the City and County of San\nFrancisco filed actions in California state courts alleging that\nthe State’s marriage statutes violated the California Constitu-\ntion. Proposition 22 was among the statutes challenged,\n\f1592                         PERRY v. BROWN\nbecause as an initiative statutory enactment, it was equal in\ndignity to an enactment by the Legislature and thus subject to\nthe restrictions of the state constitution.1 The consolidated\ncases were eventually decided by the California Supreme\nCourt, which held the statutes to be unconstitutional, for two\nindependent reasons.\n\n   First, the court held that the fundamental right to marry\nprovided by the California Constitution could not be denied\nto same-sex couples, who are guaranteed “the same substan-\ntive constitutional rights as opposite-sex couples to choose\none’s life partner and enter with that person into a committed,\nofficially recognized, and protected family relationship that\nenjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage.”\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 433-34. The court began by reaf-\nfirming that “the right to marry is an integral component of\nan individual’s interest in personal autonomy protected by the\nprivacy provision of article I, section 1 [of the California Con-\nstitution], and of the liberty interest protected by the due pro-\ncess clause of article I, section 7.” Id. at 426 (emphasis\nomitted). It then held “that an individual’s homosexual orien-\ntation is not a constitutionally legitimate basis for withholding\nor restricting the individual’s legal rights.” Id. at 429. The\ncourt acknowledged that although such an inclusive under-\nstanding of the right to marry was one that had developed\nonly “in recent decades,” as the State extended greater recog-\nnition to same-sex couples and households, it was “apparent\nthat history alone does not provide a justification for interpret-\n  1\n    The California Constitution differentiates between initiative statutes,\nwhich require petitions signed by five percent of electors, and initiative\nconstitutional amendments, which require petitions signed by eight per-\ncent of electors. Cal. Const. art. 2, § 8(b). An initiative statutory enactment\nhas somewhat greater status than a statute adopted by the Legislature, in\nthat the Legislature may not amend or repeal the initiative statute without\nsubmitting the change to approval by the electors (unless the initiative\nstatute provides otherwise). Id. § 10(c). Yet, like a statutory enactment by\nthe Legislature, and unlike an initiative constitutional amendment, it is\nsubject to the terms of the state constitution.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1593\ning the constitutional right to marry as protecting only one’s\nability to enter into an officially recognized family relation-\nship with a person of the opposite sex,” because\n“ ‘[f]undamental rights, once recognized, cannot be denied to\nparticular groups on the ground that these groups have histori-\ncally been denied those rights.’ ” Id. at 428-30 (quoting Her-\nnandez v. Robles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1995297\"><a href=\"/opinion/1995297/hernandez-v-robles/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 381 (2006) (Kaye, C.J.,\ndissenting)).\n\n   The court concluded its due process analysis by rejecting\nthe argument that the availability of domestic partnerships sat-\nisfied “all of the personal and dignity interests that have tradi-\ntionally informed the right to marry,” because “[t]he current\nstatutes—by drawing a distinction between the name assigned\nto the family relationship available to opposite-sex couples\nand the name assigned to the family relationship available to\nsame-sex couples, and by reserving the historic and highly\nrespected designation of ‘marriage’ exclusively to opposite-\nsex couples while offering same-sex couples only the new and\nunfamiliar designation of domestic partnership—pose a seri-\nous risk of denying the official family relationship of same-\nsex couples the equal dignity and respect that is a core ele-\nment of the constitutional right to marry.” Id. at 434-35.\n\n   Second, the court held that “[t]he current statutory assign-\nment of different names for the official family relationships of\nopposite-sex couples on the one hand, and of same-sex cou-\nples on the other” violated the equal protection clause in arti-\ncle I, section 7 of the California Constitution. Id. at 435, 452-\n53. The court determined that the State had no interest in\nreserving the name ‘marriage’ for opposite-sex couples; “the\nhistoric and well-established nature of this limitation” could\nnot itself justify the differential treatment, and the court found\nno reason that restricting the designation of ‘marriage’ to\nopposite-sex couples was necessary to preserve the benefits of\nmarriage enjoyed by opposite-sex couples or their children.\nId. at 450-52. The court noted specifically that “the distinction\nin nomenclature between marriage and domestic partnership\n\f1594                    PERRY v. BROWN\ncannot be defended on the basis of an asserted difference in\nthe effect on children of being raised by an opposite-sex cou-\nple instead of by a same-sex couple,” because “the governing\nCalifornia statutes permit same-sex couples to adopt and raise\nchildren and additionally draw no distinction between married\ncouples and domestic partners with regard to the legal rights\nand responsibilities relating to children raised within each of\nthese family relationships.” Id. at 452 n.72. Restricting access\nto the designation of ‘marriage’ did, however, “work[ ] a real\nand appreciable harm upon same-sex couples and their chil-\ndren,” because “providing only a novel, alternative institution\nfor same-sex couples” constituted “an official statement that\nthe family relationship of same-sex couples is not of compara-\nble stature or equal dignity to the family relationship of\nopposite-sex couples.” Id. at 452. Consequently, the court\ndetermined that withholding only the name ‘marriage’ from\nsame-sex couples violated the California Constitution’s guar-\nantee of equal protection.\n\n   The court remedied these constitutional violations by strik-\ning the language from the marriage statutes “limiting the des-\nignation of marriage to a union ‘between a man and a\nwoman,’ ” invalidating Proposition 22, and ordering that the\ndesignation of ‘marriage’ be made available to both opposite-\nsex and same-sex couples. Id. at 453. Following the court’s\ndecision, California counties issued more than 18,000 mar-\nriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n                               C\n\n   Five      California      residents—defendants-intervenors-\nappellants Dennis Hollingsworth, Gail J. Knight, Martin F.\nGutierrez, Hak-Shing William Tam, and Mark A. Jansson\n(collectively, “Proponents”)—collected voter signatures and\nfiled petitions with the state government to place an initiative\non the November 4, 2008, ballot. Unlike Proposition 22, this\nwas an initiative constitutional amendment, which would be\nequal in effect to any other provision of the California Consti-\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1595\ntution, rather than subordinate to it. The Proponents’ measure,\ndesignated Proposition 8, proposed to add a new provision to\nthe California Constitution’s Declaration of Rights, immedi-\nately following the Constitution’s due process and equal pro-\ntection clauses. The provision states, “Only marriage between\na man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.”\nAccording to the official voter information guide, Proposition\n8 “[c]hanges the California Constitution to eliminate the right\nof same-sex couples to marry in California.” Official Voter\nInformation Guide, California General Election (Nov. 4,\n2008), at 54. Following a contentious campaign, a slim major-\nity of California voters (52.3 percent) approved Proposition 8.\nPursuant to the state constitution, Proposition 8 took effect the\nnext day, as article I, section 7.5 of the California Constitu-\ntion.\n\n   Opponents of Proposition 8 then brought an original action\nfor a writ of mandate in the California Supreme Court. They\ncontended that Proposition 8 exceeded the scope of the Peo-\nple’s initiative power because it revised, rather than amended,\nthe California Constitution. The opponents did not raise any\nfederal constitutional challenge to Proposition 8 in the state\ncourt. The state officials named as respondents refused to\ndefend the measure’s validity, but Proponents were permitted\nto intervene and do so. Following argument, the court upheld\nProposition 8 as a valid initiative but construed the measure\nas not nullifying the 18,000-plus marriages of same-sex cou-\nples that had already been performed in the State. Strauss v.\nHorton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98-110, 119-22 (Cal. 2009).\n\n   The court also explained Proposition 8’s precise effect on\nCalifornia law: “[T]he measure carves out a narrow and lim-\nited exception to the[ ] state constitutional rights [articulated\nin the Marriage Cases], reserving the official designation of\nthe term ‘marriage’ for the union of opposite-sex couples as\na matter of state constitutional law, but leaving undisturbed all\nof the other extremely significant substantive aspects of a\nsame-sex couple’s state constitutional right to establish an\n\f1596                       PERRY v. BROWN\nofficially recognized and protected family relationship and the\nguarantee of equal protection of the laws.” Id. at 61; see also\nid. at 75. In other words, after Proposition 8, “[s]ame-sex cou-\nples retain all of the fundamental substantive components\nencompassed within the constitutional rights of privacy and\ndue process, with the sole (albeit significant) exception of the\nright to equal access to the designation ‘marriage.’ ” Id. at\n116. Proposition 8 accomplished this result not by “declar-\n[ing] the state of the law as it existed when the Marriage\nCases decision was rendered, but instead [by] establish[ing]\na new substantive state constitutional rule that became effec-\ntive once Proposition 8 was approved by the voters.” Id. at\n115; see also id. at 63.\n\n                                   II\n\n                                   A\n\n   Two same-sex couples—plaintiffs Kristin Perry and Sandra\nStier, and Paul Katami and Jeffrey Zarrillo—filed this action\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in May 2009, after being denied mar-\nriage licenses by the County Clerks of Alameda County and\nLos Angeles County, respectively. Alleging that Proposition\n8 violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, they sought a declaration of its unconstitutional-\nity and an injunction barring its enforcement. The City and\nCounty of San Francisco (“San Francisco”) was later permit-\nted to intervene as a plaintiff to present evidence of the\namendment’s effects on its governmental interests. The\ndefendants—the two county clerks and four state officers,\nincluding the Governor and Attorney General—filed answers\nto the complaint but once again refused to argue in favor of\nProposition 8’s constitutionality. As a result, the district court\ngranted Proponents’ motion to intervene as of right under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) to defend the validity\nof the proposition they had sponsored.2\n  2\n   The district court subsequently denied the motion to intervene brought\nby the Campaign for California Families, a public interest organization\n\f                             PERRY v.

Although other states may act differently, California’s\nconferral upon proponents of the authority to represent the\nPeople’s interest in the initiative measure they sponsored is\nconsistent with that state’s unparalleled commitment to the\nauthority of the electorate: “No other state in the nation car-\nries the concept of initiatives as ‘written in stone’ to such\n\f1604                    PERRY v.

The\nPeople of California are largely free to structure their system\nof governance as they choose, and we respect their choice. All\nthat matters, for federal standing purposes, is that the People\nhave an interest in the validity of Proposition 8 and that, under\nCalifornia law, Proponents are authorized to represent the\nPeople’s interest. That is the case here.\n\n   In their supplemental brief on the issue of standing, Plain-\ntiffs argue for the first time that Proponents must satisfy the\nrequirements of third-party standing in order to assert the\ninterests of the State of California in this litigation. Litigants\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                        1605\nwho wish “to bring actions on behalf of third parties” must\nsatisfy three requirements. Powers v.

First, they “must have suffered an ‘injury in\nfact,’ thus giving [them] a ‘sufficiently concrete interest’ in\nthe outcome of the issue in dispute.” Id. at 411. Second, they\n“must have a close relation to the third party.” Id. Third,\n“there must exist some hindrance to the third party’s ability\nto protect his or her own interests.” Id. Plaintiffs contend that\nProponents cannot satisfy these requirements with respect to\nthe State of California as a third party.\n\n    The requirements of third-party standing, however, are\nbeside the point: the State of California is no more a “third\nparty” relative to Proponents than it is to the executive offi-\ncers of the State who ordinarily assert the State’s interest in\nlitigation. As the California Supreme Court has explained,\n“the role played by the proponents” in litigation “regarding\nthe validity or proper interpretation of a voter-approved initia-\ntive measure . . . is comparable to the role ordinarily played\nby the Attorney General or other public officials in vigorously\ndefending a duly enacted state law.” Perry VII, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 525. When the Attorney General of California appears\nin federal court to defend the validity of a state statute, she\nobviously need not satisfy the requirements of third-party\nstanding; she stands in the shoes of the State to assert its inter-\nests in litigation. For the purposes of the litigation, she speaks\nto the court as the State, not as a third party. The same is true\nof Proponents here, just as it was true of the presiding legisla-\ntive officers in Karcher, 484 U.S. at 82. The requirements of\nthird-party standing are therefore not relevant.\n\n   [2] Nor is it relevant whether Proponents have suffered a\npersonal injury, in their capacities as private individuals.\nAlthough we asked the California Supreme Court whether\n“the official proponents of an initiative measure possess either\na particularized interest in the initiative’s validity or the\nauthority to assert the State’s interest in the initiative’s validi-\nty,” Perry V, 628 F.3d at 1193 (emphasis added), the Court\n\f1606                         PERRY v. BROWN\nchose to address only the latter type of interest. Perry VII, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The exclu-\nsive basis of our holding that Proponents possess Article III\nstanding is their authority to assert the interests of the State\nof California, rather than any authority that they might have\nto assert particularized interests of their own. Just as the\nAttorney General of California need not satisfy the require-\nments of third-party standing when she appears in federal\ncourt to defend the validity of a state statute, she obviously\nneed not show that she would suffer any personal injury as a\nresult of the statute’s invalidity. The injury of which she com-\nplains is the State’s, not her own. The same is true here.\nBecause “a State has standing to defend the constitutionality\nof its [laws],” Diamond, 476 U.S. at 62, Proponents need not\nshow that they would suffer any personal injury from the\ninvalidation of Proposition 8. That the State would suffer an\ninjury, id., is enough for Proponents to have Article III stand-\ning when state law authorizes them to assert the State’s inter-\nests.\n\n   To be clear, we do not suggest that state law has any\n“power directly to enlarge or contract federal jurisdiction.”\nDuchek v.

Aside from\nthese findings, the only fact found by the district court that\nmatters to our analysis is that “[d]omestic partnerships lack\nthe social meaning associated with marriage”—that the differ-\nence between the designation of ‘marriage’ and the designa-\ntion of ‘domestic partnership’ is meaningful.

Supp. 2d at 991-95; and second,\nit excludes same-sex couples from state-sponsored marriage\nwhile allowing opposite-sex couples access to that honored\nstatus, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, see id. at\n997-1003. Plaintiffs elaborate upon those arguments on\nappeal.\n\n   Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervenor San Francisco also offer\na third argument: Proposition 8 singles out same-sex couples\nfor unequal treatment by taking away from them alone the\nright to marry, and this action amounts to a distinct constitu-\ntional violation because the Equal Protection Clause protects\nminority groups from being targeted for the deprivation of an\nexisting right without a legitimate reason. Romer, 517 U.S. at\n634-35. Because this third argument applies to the specific\nhistory of same-sex marriage in California, it is the narrowest\nground for adjudicating the constitutional questions before us,\nwhile the first two theories, if correct, would apply on a\nbroader basis. Because courts generally decide constitutional\nquestions on the narrowest ground available, we consider the\nthird argument first. See Plaut v.

BROWN\nthe right to have their committed relationships recognized by\nthe State with the designation of ‘marriage,’ which the state\nconstitution had previously guaranteed them, while leaving in\nplace all of their other rights and responsibilities as partners—\nrights and responsibilities that are identical to those of mar-\nried spouses and form an integral part of the marriage rela-\ntionship. In determining that the law had this effect, “[w]e\nrely not upon our own interpretation of the amendment but\nupon the authoritative construction of [California’s] Supreme\nCourt.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 626. The state high court held in\nStrauss that “Proposition 8 reasonably must be interpreted in\na limited fashion as eliminating only the right of same-sex\ncouples to equal access to the designation of marriage, and as\nnot otherwise affecting the constitutional right of those cou-\nples to establish an officially recognized family relationship,”\nwhich California calls a ‘domestic partnership.’ 207 P.3d at\n76. Proposition 8 “leaves intact all of the other very signifi-\ncant constitutional protections afforded same-sex couples,”\nincluding “the constitutional right to enter into an officially\nrecognized and protected family relationship with the person\nof one’s choice and to raise children in that family if the cou-\nple so chooses.” Id. at 102. Thus, the extent of the amend-\nment’s effect was to “establish[ ] a new substantive state\nconstitutional rule,” id. at 63, which “carves out a narrow and\nlimited exception to these state constitutional rights,” by “re-\nserving the official designation of the term ‘marriage’ for the\nunion of opposite-sex couples as a matter of state constitu-\ntional law,” id. at 61.11\n  11\n     In rejecting the argument that Proposition 8 had impermissibly\nrevised, rather than amended, the state constitution, Strauss explained that\nit “drastically overstates the effect of Proposition 8 on the fundamental\nstate constitutional rights of same-sex couples” to suggest that the proposi-\ntion “ ‘eliminat[ed]’ or ‘stripp[ed]’ same-sex couples of a fundamental\nconstitutional right,” because the substantive protections of the state equal\nprotection clause and due process and privacy provisions remained intact\n—with the “sole, albeit significant, exception” of the right to use the des-\nignation of ‘marriage,’ which was eliminated for same-sex couples. 207\nP.3d at 102.\n\f                        PERRY v.

Strauss, 207 P.3d at\n61 (quoting Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 434). In adopting\nthe amendment, the People simply took the designation of\n‘marriage’ away from lifelong same-sex partnerships, and\nwith it the State’s authorization of that official status and the\nsocietal approval that comes with it.\n\n   By emphasizing Proposition 8’s limited effect, we do not\nmean to minimize the harm that this change in the law caused\nto same-sex couples and their families. To the contrary, we\nemphasize the extraordinary significance of the official desig-\nnation of ‘marriage.’ That designation is important because\n‘marriage’ is the name that society gives to the relationship\nthat matters most between two adults. A rose by any other\nname may smell as sweet, but to the couple desiring to enter\ninto a committed lifelong relationship, a marriage by the name\nof ‘registered domestic partnership’ does not.

See id. at 971.\n\n   We need consider only the many ways in which we\nencounter the word ‘marriage’ in our daily lives and under-\nstand it, consciously or not, to convey a sense of significance.\nWe are regularly given forms to complete that ask us whether\nwe are “single” or “married.” Newspapers run announcements\nof births, deaths, and marriages. We are excited to see some-\none ask, “Will you marry me?”, whether on bended knee in\na restaurant or in text splashed across a stadium Jumbotron.\nCertainly it would not have the same effect to see “Will you\nenter into a registered domestic partnership with me?”.\nGroucho Marx’s one-liner, “Marriage is a wonderful institu-\ntion . . . but who wants to live in an institution?” would lack\nits punch if the word ‘marriage’ were replaced with the alter-\nnative phrase. So too with Shakespeare’s “A young man mar-\nried is a man that’s marr’d,” Lincoln’s “Marriage is neither\nheaven nor hell, it is simply purgatory,” and Sinatra’s “A man\ndoesn’t know what happiness is until he’s married. By then\nit’s too late.” We see tropes like “marrying for love” versus\n“marrying for money” played out again and again in our films\nand literature because of the recognized importance and per-\nmanence of the marriage relationship. Had Marilyn Monroe’s\nfilm been called How to Register a Domestic Partnership with\na Millionaire, it would not have conveyed the same meaning\nas did her famous movie, even though the underlying drama\nfor same-sex couples is no different. The name ‘marriage’ sig-\nnifies the unique recognition that society gives to harmonious,\nloyal, enduring, and intimate relationships. See Knight v.\nSuper.

BROWN\nconsidered a more substantial relationship and is accorded a\ngreater stature than a domestic partnership.”); cf. Griswold,\n381 U.S. at 486.\n\n   The official, cherished status of ‘marriage’ is distinct from\nthe incidents of marriage, such as those listed in the California\nFamily Code. The incidents are both elements of the institu-\ntion and manifestations of the recognition that the State\naffords to those who are in stable and committed lifelong rela-\ntionships. We allow spouses but not siblings or roommates to\nfile taxes jointly, for example, because we acknowledge the\nfinancial interdependence of those who have entered into an\n“enduring” relationship. The incidents of marriage, standing\nalone, do not, however, convey the same governmental and\nsocietal recognition as does the designation of ‘marriage’\nitself. We do not celebrate when two people merge their bank\naccounts; we celebrate when a couple marries. The designa-\ntion of ‘marriage’ is the status that we recognize. It is the\nprincipal manner in which the State attaches respect and dig-\nnity to the highest form of a committed relationship and to the\nindividuals who have entered into it.12\n\n   [5] We set this forth because we must evaluate Proposition\n8’s constitutionality in light of its actual and specific effects\non committed same-sex couples desiring to enter into an offi-\ncially recognized lifelong relationship. Before Proposition 8,\nCalifornia guaranteed gays and lesbians both the incidents and\nthe status and dignity of marriage. Proposition 8 left the inci-\ndents but took away the status and the dignity. It did so by\n  12\n     Cf. Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 434-35 (“[D]rawing a distinction\nbetween the name assigned to the family relationship available to\nopposite-sex couples and the name assigned to the family relationship\navailable to same-sex couples, and . . . reserving the historic and highly\nrespected designation of marriage exclusively to opposite-sex couples\nwhile offering same-sex couples only the new and unfamiliar designation\nof domestic partnership[,] pose[s] a serious risk of denying the official\nfamily relationship of same-sex couples the equal dignity and respect that\nis a core element of the constitutional right to marry.”).\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1615\nsuperseding the Marriage Cases and thus endorsing the “offi-\ncial statement that the family relationship of same-sex couples\nis not of comparable stature or equal dignity to the family\nrelationship of opposite-sex couples.” Marriage Cases, 183\nP.3d at 452. The question we therefore consider is this: did\nthe People of California have legitimate reasons for enacting\na constitutional amendment that serves only to take away\nfrom same-sex couples the right to have their lifelong rela-\ntionships dignified by the official status of ‘marriage,’ and to\ncompel the State and its officials and all others authorized to\nperform marriage ceremonies to substitute the label of\n‘domestic partnership’ for their relationships?\n\n   Proponents resist this framing of the question. They deem\nit irrelevant to our inquiry that the California Constitution, as\ninterpreted by the Marriage Cases, had previously guaranteed\nsame-sex couples the right to use the designation of ‘mar-\nriage,’ because In re Marriage Cases was a “short-lived deci-\nsion,” and same-sex couples were allowed to marry only\nduring a “143-day hiatus” between the effective date of the\nMarriage Cases decision and the enactment of Proposition 8.\nProponents’ Reply Br. 75, 79-80. According to Proponents, a\ndecision to “restore” the “traditional definition of marriage”\nis indistinguishable from a decision to “adhere” to that defini-\ntion in the first place. Id. at 79-80. We are bound, however,\nby the California Supreme Court’s authoritative interpretation\nof Proposition 8’s effect on California law, see Romer, 517\nU.S. at 626: Proposition 8 “eliminat[ed] . . . the right of same-\nsex couples to equal access to the designation of marriage” by\n“carv[ing] out a narrow and limited exception to these state\nconstitutional rights” that had previously guaranteed the des-\nignation of ‘marriage’ to all couples, opposite-sex and same-\nsex alike. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61, 76.\n\n   Even were we not bound by the state court’s explanation,\nwe would be obligated to consider Proposition 8 in light of its\nactual effect, which was, as the voters were told, to “eliminate\nthe right of same-sex couples to marry in California.” Voter\n\f1616                    PERRY v. BROWN\nInformation Guide at 54. The context matters. Withdrawing\nfrom a disfavored group the right to obtain a designation with\nsignificant societal consequences is different from declining\nto extend that designation in the first place, regardless of\nwhether the right was withdrawn after a week, a year, or a\ndecade. The action of changing something suggests a more\ndeliberate purpose than does the inaction of leaving it as it is.\nAs the California Supreme Court held, “Proposition 8 [did]\nnot ‘readjudicate’ the issue that was litigated and resolved in\nthe Marriage Cases.” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 63. Rather than\n“declar[ing] the state of the law as it existed under the Cali-\nfornia Constitution at the time of the Marriage Cases,” Propo-\nsition 8 “establishe[d] a new substantive state constitutional\nrule that took effect upon” its adoption by the electorate. Id.\n(emphasis added). Whether or not it is a historical accident,\nas Proponents argue, that Proposition 8 postdated the Mar-\nriage Cases rather than predating and thus preempting that\ndecision, the relative timing of the two events is a fact, and\nwe must decide this case on its facts.\n\n                               C\n\n                               1\n\n   This is not the first time the voters of a state have enacted\nan initiative constitutional amendment that reduces the rights\nof gays and lesbians under state law. In 1992, Colorado\nadopted Amendment 2 to its state constitution, which prohib-\nited the state and its political subdivisions from providing any\nprotection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orien-\ntation. See Colo. Const. art. II, § 30b. Amendment 2 was pro-\nposed in response to a number of local ordinances that had\nbanned sexual-orientation discrimination in such areas as\nhousing, employment, education, public accommodations,\nand health and welfare services. The effect of Amendment 2\nwas “to repeal” those local laws and “to prohibit any govern-\nmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective stat-\nutes, regulations, ordinances, or policies in the future.” Evans\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                            1617\nv.

The law thus\n“withdr[ew] from homosexuals, but no others, specific legal\nprotection . . . , and it forb[ade] reinstatement of these laws\nand policies.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 627.\n\n   [6] The Supreme Court held that Amendment 2 violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause because “[i]t is not within our\nconstitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort”—laws that\n“singl[e] out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal\nstatus,” which “raise the inevitable inference that the disad-\nvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of per-\nsons affected.” Id. at 633-34. The Court considered possible\njustifications for Amendment 2 that might have overcome the\n“inference” of animus, but it found them all lacking. It there-\nfore concluded that the law “classifie[d] homosexuals not to\nfurther a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to\neveryone else.” Id. at 635.13\n\n   [7] Proposition 8 is remarkably similar to Amendment 2.\nLike Amendment 2, Proposition 8 “single[s] out a certain\nclass of citizens for disfavored legal status . . . .” Id. at 633.\nLike Amendment 2, Proposition 8 has the “peculiar property,”\nid. at 632, of “withdraw[ing] from homosexuals, but no oth-\ners,” an existing legal right—here, access to the official desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’—that had been broadly available,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the Constitution did not compel\nthe state to confer it in the first place. Id. at 627. Like Amend-\n   13\n      Romer did not apply heightened scrutiny to Amendment 2, even\nthough the amendment targeted gays and lesbians. Instead, Romer found\nthat Amendment 2 “fail[ed], indeed defie[d], even [the] conventional\ninquiry” for non-suspect classes, concerning whether a “legislative classi-\nfication . . . bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.” Romer, 517\nU.S. at 631-32. Amendment 2 amounted to “a classification of persons\nundertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does\nnot permit.” Id. at 635.

BROWN\nment 2, Proposition 8 denies “equal protection of the laws in\nthe most literal sense,” id. at 633, because it “carves out” an\n“exception” to California’s equal protection clause, by remov-\ning equal access to marriage, which gays and lesbians had\npreviously enjoyed, from the scope of that constitutional guar-\nantee. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61. Like Amendment 2, Proposi-\ntion 8 “by state decree . . . put[s] [homosexuals] in a solitary\nclass with respect to” an important aspect of human relations,\nand accordingly “imposes a special disability upon [homosex-\nuals] alone.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 627, 631. And like Amend-\nment 2, Proposition 8 constitutionalizes that disability,\nmeaning that gays and lesbians may overcome it “only by\nenlisting the citizenry of [the state] to amend the State Consti-\ntution” for a second time. Id. at 631. As we explain below,\nRomer compels that we affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n   To be sure, there are some differences between Amend-\nment 2 and Proposition 8. Amendment 2 “impos[ed] a broad\nand undifferentiated disability on a single named group” by\n“identif[ying] persons by a single trait and then den[ying]\nthem protection across the board.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632-33.\nProposition 8, by contrast, excises with surgical precision one\nspecific right: the right to use the designation of ‘marriage’ to\ndescribe a couple’s officially recognized relationship. Propo-\nnents argue that Proposition 8 thus merely “restor[es] the tra-\nditional definition of marriage while otherwise leaving\nundisturbed the manifold rights and protections California law\nprovides gays and lesbians,” making it unlike Amendment 2,\nwhich eliminated various substantive rights. Proponents’\nReply Br. 77.\n\n  These differences, however, do not render Romer less\napplicable. It is no doubt true that the “special disability” that\nProposition 8 “imposes upon” gays and lesbians has a less\nsweeping effect on their public and private transactions than\ndid Amendment 2. Nevertheless, Proposition 8 works a mean-\ningful harm to gays and lesbians, by denying to their commit-\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                           1619\nted lifelong relationships the societal status conveyed by the\ndesignation of ‘marriage,’ and this harm must be justified by\nsome legitimate state interest. Romer, 517 U.S. at 631. Propo-\nsition 8 is no less problematic than Amendment 2 merely\nbecause its effect is narrower; to the contrary, the surgical\nprecision with which it excises a right belonging to gay and\nlesbian couples makes it even more suspect. A law that has no\npractical effect except to strip one group of the right to use a\nstate-authorized and socially meaningful designation is all the\nmore “unprecedented” and “unusual” than a law that imposes\nbroader changes, and raises an even stronger “inference that\nthe disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the\nclass of persons affected,” id. at 633-34. In short, Romer gov-\nerns our analysis notwithstanding the differences between\nAmendment 2 and Proposition 8.\n\n   [8] There is one further important similarity between this\ncase and Romer. Neither case requires that the voters have\nstripped the state’s gay and lesbian citizens of any federal\nconstitutional right. In Romer, Amendment 2 deprived gays\nand lesbians of statutory protections against discrimination;\nhere, Proposition 8 deprived same-sex partners of the right to\nuse the designation of ‘marriage.’ There is no necessity in\neither case that the privilege, benefit, or protection at issue be\na constitutional right. We therefore need not and do not con-\nsider whether same-sex couples have a fundamental right to\nmarry, or whether states that fail to afford the right to marry\nto gays and lesbians must do so. Further, we express no view\non those questions.14\n   14\n      Because we do not address the question of the constitutionality of a\nstate’s ban on same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court’s summary dismissal\nof Baker v. Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972) (mem.), is not pertinent here.\n   In Baker, the Court “dismissed for want of a substantial federal ques-\ntion” an appeal from the Minnesota Supreme Court’s decision to uphold\na state statute that did not permit marriage between two people of the same\nsex. Id. Such dismissals “prevent lower courts from coming to opposite\nconclusions on the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by”\n\f1620                        PERRY v. BROWN\n   Ordinarily, “if a law neither burdens a fundamental right\nnor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative clas-\nsification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legiti-\nmate end.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 631. Such was the case in\nRomer, and it is the case here as well. The end must be one\nthat is legitimate for the government to pursue, not just one\nthat would be legitimate for a private actor. See id. at 632,\n635. The question here, then, is whether California had any\nmore legitimate justification for withdrawing from gays and\nlesbians its constitutional protection with respect to the offi-\ncial designation of ‘marriage’ than Colorado did for with-\ndrawing from that group all protection against discrimination\ngenerally.\n\n   Proposition 8, like Amendment 2, enacts a\n“ ‘[d]iscrimination[ ] of an unusual character,’ ” which\nrequires “ ‘careful consideration to determine whether [it] [is]\nobnoxious to the’ ” Constitution.

Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110786\"><a href=\"/opinion/110786/crawford-v-board-of-ed-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542 (1982)). Proponents appear to suggest that\nunless the Fourteenth Amendment actually requires that the\ndesignation of ‘marriage’ be given to same-sex couples in the\nfirst place, there can be no constitutional infirmity in taking\nthe designation away from that group of citizens, whatever the\nPeople’s reason for doing so.\n\n   [9] Romer forecloses this argument. The rights that were\nrepealed by Amendment 2 included protections against dis-\ncrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the private\nsphere. Those protections, like any protections against private\ndiscrimination, were not compelled by the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.15 Rather, “[s]tates ha[d] chosen to counter discrimina-\n  15\n     Indeed, as the Court observed, not only does the Fourteenth Amend-\nment not prohibit private discrimination; it does not even “give Congress\na general power to prohibit discrimination in public accommodations” by\nstatute. Romer, 517 U.S. at 628 (emphasis added) (citing Civil Rights\nCases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90897\"><a href=\"/opinion/90897/civil-rights-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1883)). Congress has passed antidiscrimination\nlaws regulating private conduct only under its Article I powers. See, e.g.,\nHeart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.

It was these elec-\ntive protections that Amendment 2 withdrew and forbade.16\nThe relevant inquiry in Romer was not whether the state of\nthe law after Amendment 2 was constitutional; there was no\ndoubt that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require\nantidiscrimination protections to be afforded to gays and les-\nbians. The question, instead, was whether the change in the\nlaw that Amendment 2 effected could be justified by some\nlegitimate purpose.\n\n   The Supreme Court’s answer was “no”—there was no\nlegitimate reason to take away broad legal protections from\ngays and lesbians alone, and to inscribe that deprivation of\nequality into the state constitution, once those protections had\nalready been provided. We therefore need not decide whether\na state may decline to provide the right to marry to same-sex\ncouples. To determine the validity of Proposition 8, we must\nconsider only whether the change in the law that it effected—\neliminating by constitutional amendment the right of same-\nsex couples to have the official designation and status of\n‘marriage’ bestowed upon their relationships, while maintain-\ning that right for opposite-sex couples—was justified by a\nlegitimate reason.\n\n   [10] This does not mean that the Constitution is a “one-\nway ratchet,” as Proponents suggest. It means only that the\nEqual Protection Clause requires the state to have a legitimate\nreason for withdrawing a right or benefit from one group but\n  16\n     The protections at issue in Romer were not of substantially more dis-\ntant provenance than the protection at issue here. While Aspen and Boul-\nder had enacted their ordinances somewhat earlier, Denver’s ordinance—\nwhich covered a far greater population—had taken effect only the year\nbefore Colorado voters adopted Amendment 2. Evans, 854 P.2d at 1284.\n\f                           PERRY v. BROWN                          1623\nnot others, whether or not it was required to confer that right\nor benefit in the first place. Thus, when Congress, having cho-\nsen to provide food stamps to the poor in the Food Stamp Act\nof 1964, amended the Act to exclude households of unrelated\nindividuals, such as “hippies” living in “hippie communes,”\nthe Supreme Court held the amendment unconstitutional\nbecause “a bare congressional desire to harm a politically\nunpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental\ninterest.” U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v.

In both Romer and Moreno, the constitutional viola-\ntion that the Supreme Court identified was not the failure to\nconfer a right or benefit in the first place; Congress was no\nmore obligated to provide food stamps than Colorado was to\nenact antidiscrimination laws. Rather, what the Supreme\nCourt forbade in each case was the targeted exclusion of a\ngroup of citizens from a right or benefit that they had enjoyed\non equal terms with all other citizens. The constitutional\ninjury that Romer and Moreno identified—and that serves as\na basis of our decision to strike down Proposition 8—has little\nto do with the substance of the right or benefit from which a\ngroup is excluded, and much to do with the act of exclusion\nitself.

In Craw-\nford, the Court affirmed Proposition 1, a California initiative\nconstitutional amendment that barred state courts from order-\ning school busing or pupil-assignment plans except when nec-\nessary to remedy a federal constitutional violation. Id. at 531-\n32. Like Proposition 8, Proposition 1 was adopted in response\nto a decision of the California Supreme Court under the state\nconstitution, which had held that state schools were obligated\nto take “reasonably feasible steps,” including busing and\npupil-assignment plans, “to alleviate school segregation.”\nCrawford v. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1175930\"><a href=\"/opinion/1175930/crawford-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (Cal. 1976). The\nSupreme Court “reject[ed] the contention that once a State\nchooses to do ‘more’ than the Fourteenth Amendment\nrequires, it may never recede.”17 Crawford, 458 U.S. at 535.\n  17\n    Additionally, the Court stated that it “would not interpret the Four-\nteenth Amendment to require the people of a State to adhere to a judicial\n\f1624                        PERRY v. BROWN\nThat conclusion was consistent with the principle that states\nshould be free “to experiment” with social policy, without\nfear of being locked in to “legislation that has proved unwork-\nable or harmful when the State was under no obligation to\nadopt the legislation in the first place.” Id. at 535, 539-40.\n\n   Critically, however, the Court noted that Proposition 1 did\nnot itself draw any classification; “[i]t simply forb[ade] state\ncourts” from ordering specific remedies under state law “in\nthe absence of a Fourteenth Amendment violation,” while\nmaintaining the state constitution’s more robust “right to\ndesegregation than exists under the Federal Constitution.” Id.\nat 537, 542 (emphasis added); see also id. at 544 (noting that\nother remedies remained available). Most important, the prop-\nosition’s purported benefit, “neighborhood schooling,” was\n“made available regardless of race.” Id. There was no evi-\ndence that the “purpose of [the] repealing legislation [was] to\n\nconstruction of their State Constitution when that Constitution itself vests\nfinal authority in the people.” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 540. In enacting\nProposition 8, the People did not “declare the state of the law as it existed\nwhen the Marriage Cases decision was rendered, but instead establishe[d]\na new substantive state constitutional rule” that amended the charter’s text\nto supersede the previous California Declaration of Rights. Strauss, 207\nP.3d at 115. The People thus acted as Congress does when it disapproves\nof a statutory interpretation by a federal court and enacts a new statute to\nproduce its preferred result. See, e.g., Religious Freedom Restoration Act\nof 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-141 (enacted in response to the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Employment Division v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990)). Of\ncourse, Crawford did not suggest that it ends the inquiry to note that the\nFourteenth Amendment generally allows the People to exercise their state\nconstitutional right to supersede a decision of the state supreme court by\nan initiative constitutional amendment. A federal court must still deter-\nmine whether the constitutional amendment enacted by the People is oth-\nerwise valid under the Federal Constitution; sometimes laws passed\nbecause of disagreement with judicial decisions are not.

Following Romer, we must therefore decide whether\na legitimate interest exists that justifies the People of Califor-\nnia’s action in taking away from same-sex couples the right\nto use the official designation and enjoy the status of\n‘marriage’—a legitimate interest that suffices to overcome the\n“inevitable inference” of animus to which Proposition 8’s dis-\ncriminatory effects otherwise give rise.\n\n                                   D\n\n   We first consider four possible reasons offered by Propo-\nnents or amici to explain why Proposition 8 might have been\nenacted: (1) furthering California’s interest in childrearing\nand responsible procreation, (2) proceeding with caution\nbefore making significant changes to marriage, (3) protecting\nreligious freedom, and (4) preventing children from being\ntaught about same-sex marriage in schools. To be credited,\nthese rationales “must find some footing in the realities of the\nsubject addressed by the legislation.” Heller v.

Proponents’ Br. 77-93. This rationale\nappears to comprise two distinct elements. The first is that\nchildren are better off when raised by two biological parents\n  19\n    As we have noted, we need not consider whether any form of height-\nened scrutiny is necessary or appropriate in order to reach the result we\ndo. See supra note 13.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1627\nand that society can increase the likelihood of that family\nstructure by allowing only potential biological parents—one\nman and one woman—to marry. The second is that marriage\nreduces the threat of “irresponsible procreation”—that is,\nunintended pregnancies out of wedlock—by providing an\nincentive for couples engaged in potentially procreative sex-\nual activity to form stable family units. Because same-sex\ncouples are not at risk of “irresponsible procreation” as a mat-\nter of biology, Proponents argue, there is simply no need to\noffer such couples the same incentives. Proposition 8 is not\nrationally related, however, to either of these purported inter-\nests, whether or not the interests would be legitimate under\nother circumstances.\n\n   [11] We need not decide whether there is any merit to the\nsociological premise of Proponents’ first argument—that fam-\nilies headed by two biological parents are the best environ-\nments in which to raise children—because even if Proponents\nare correct, Proposition 8 had absolutely no effect on the abil-\nity of same-sex couples to become parents or the manner in\nwhich children are raised in California. As we have explained,\nProposition 8 in no way modified the state’s laws governing\nparentage, which are distinct from its laws governing mar-\nriage. See Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61. Both before and after Prop-\nosition 8, committed opposite-sex couples (“spouses”) and\nsame-sex couples (“domestic partners”) had identical rights\nwith regard to forming families and raising children. See Cal.\nFam. Code § 297.5(d) (“The rights and obligations of regis-\ntered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of\nthem shall be the same as those of spouses.”). Similarly, Prop-\nosition 8 did not alter the California adoption or presumed-\nparentage laws, which continue to apply equally to same-sex\ncouples. Cf. Elisa B., 117 P.3d at 667-71 (applying the pre-\nsumed parentage statutes to a lesbian couple); Sharon S. v.\nSuper. Ct., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585478\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585478/sharon-s-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570 (Cal. 2003) (applying the adop-\ntion laws to a lesbian couple).

BROWN\nby two biological parents, Proposition 8 would have had to\nmodify these laws in some way. It did not do so.20\n\n   Moreover, California’s “current policies and conduct . . .\nrecognize that gay individuals are fully capable of . . . respon-\nsibly caring for and raising children.” Marriage Cases, 183\nP.3d at 428. And California law actually prefers a non-\nbiological parent who has a parental relationship with a child\nto a biological parent who does not; in California, the parent-\nage statutes place a premium on the “social relationship,” not\nthe “biological relationship,” between a parent and a child.\nSee, e.g., Susan H. v.

As our dissent-\ning colleague states, the fact that Proposition 8 left intact California’s laws\nconcerning family formation and childrearing by same-sex couples distin-\nguishes this case from Citizens. See Dissent at 1669 (“Unlike the Nebraska\nconstitutional amendment, which prohibited the recognition of both mar-\nriages by same-sex couples and other same-sex relationships, Proposition\n8 left California’s existing domestic partnership laws intact. . . . Thus, it\ncannot be said that Proposition 8 ‘confer[s] the inducements of marital . . .\nbenefits on opposite-sex couples . . . , but not on same-sex couples . . . .\n’ ” (all but first alteration in original)).\n  We also note that the Nebraska constitutional amendment at issue in\nCitizens did not withdraw an existing right from same-sex couples as did\nProposition 8. Cf. Dissent at 1660 n.2.

BROWN                          1629\nbecause unlike opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples pose\nno risk of procreating accidentally. Proponents contend that\nCalifornia need not extend marriage to same-sex couples\nwhen the State’s interest in responsible procreation would not\nbe advanced by doing so, even if the interest would not be\nharmed, either. See Johnson v. Robison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383\n(1974) (“When . . . the inclusion of one group promotes a\nlegitimate governmental purpose, and the addition of other\ngroups would not, we cannot say that the statute’s classifica-\ntion of beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries is invidiously dis-\ncriminatory.”). But Plaintiffs do not ask that marriage be\nextended to anyone. As we have by now made clear, the ques-\ntion is whether there is a legitimate governmental interest in\nwithdrawing access to marriage from same-sex couples. We\ntherefore need not decide whether, under Johnson, California\nwould be justified in not extending the designation of ‘mar-\nriage’ to same-sex couples; that is not what Proposition 8 did.\nJohnson concerns decisions not to add to a legislative scheme\na group that is unnecessary to the purposes of that scheme, but\nProposition 8 subtracted a disfavored group from a scheme of\nwhich it already was a part.21\n\n   Under Romer, it is no justification for taking something\naway to say that there was no need to provide it in the first\nplace; instead, there must be some legitimate reason for the\nact of taking it away, a reason that overcomes the “inevitable\ninference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity\ntoward the class of persons affected.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 634.\nIn order to explain how rescinding access to the designation\nof ‘marriage’ is rationally related to the State’s interest in\nresponsible procreation, Proponents would have had to argue\nthat opposite-sex couples were more likely to procreate acci-\ndentally or irresponsibly when same-sex couples were\n  21\n    Moreover, Johnson did not involve a dignitary benefit that was with-\ndrawn from one group, such as an official and meaningful state designa-\ntion that established the societal status of the members of the group; it\nconcerned only a specific form of government assistance.\n\f1630                    PERRY v. BROWN\nallowed access to the designation of ‘marriage.’ We are aware\nof no basis on which this argument would be even conceiv-\nably plausible. There is no rational reason to think that taking\naway the designation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex couples\nwould advance the goal of encouraging California’s opposite-\nsex couples to procreate more responsibly. The Johnson argu-\nment, to put it mildly, does not help Proponents’ cause.\n\n   Given the realities of California law, and of human nature,\nboth parts of Proponents’ primary rationale simply “find [no]\nfooting in the realities of the subject addressed by the legisla-\ntion,” and thus cannot be credited as rational. Heller, 509 U.S.\nat 321. Whatever sense there may be in preferring biological\nparents over other couples—and we need not decide whether\nthere is any—California law clearly does not recognize such\na preference, and Proposition 8 did nothing to change that cir-\ncumstance. The same is true for Proponents’ argument that it\nis unnecessary to extend the right to use the designation of\n‘marriage’ to couples who cannot procreate, because the pur-\npose of the designation is to reward couples who procreate\nresponsibly or to encourage couples who wish to procreate to\nmarry first. Whatever merit this argument may have—and\nagain, we need not decide whether it has any—the argument\nis addressed to a failure to afford the use of the designation\nof ‘marriage’ to same-sex couples in the first place; it is irrel-\nevant to a measure withdrawing from them, and only them,\nuse of that designation.\n\n   The same analysis applies to the arguments of some amici\ncuriae that Proposition 8 not only promotes responsible pro-\ncreation and childrearing as a general matter but promotes the\nsingle best family structure for such activities. See, e.g., Br.\nAmicus Curiae of High Impact Leadership Coalition, et al. 14\n(“Society has a compelling interest in preserving the institu-\ntion that best advances the social interests in responsible pro-\ncreation, and that connects procreation to responsible child-\nrearing.”); Br. Amicus Curiae of Am. Coll. of Pediatricians 15\n(“[T]he State has a legitimate interest in promoting the family\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                             1631\nstructure that has proven most likely to foster an optimal envi-\nronment for the rearing of children.”). As discussed above,\nProposition 8 in no way alters the state laws that govern child-\nrearing and procreation. It makes no change with respect to\nthe laws regarding family structure. As before Proposition 8,\nthose laws apply in the same way to same-sex couples in\ndomestic partnerships and to married couples. Only the desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’ is withdrawn and only from one group of\nindividuals.\n\n   [12] We in no way mean to suggest that Proposition 8\nwould be constitutional if only it had gone further—for exam-\nple, by also repealing same-sex couples’ equal parental rights\nor their rights to share community property or enjoy hospital\nvisitation privileges. Only if Proposition 8 had actually had\nany effect on childrearing or “responsible procreation” would\nit be necessary or appropriate for us to consider the legitimacy\nof Proponents’ primary rationale for the measure.22 Here,\ngiven all other pertinent aspects of California law, Proposition\n8 simply could not have the effect on procreation or child-\n  22\n     The difference between what Proposition 8 did take away—only the\nname ‘marriage’—and what it might also have taken away—any of the\nsubstantive “incidents of marriage” that same-sex couples still enjoy—\ninfluenced the underlying politics of Proposition 8 and shapes the basic\nissues in this case. The official argument in favor of Proposition 8, pub-\nlished in the Voter Information Guide, emphasized this distinction: “Prop-\nosition 8 doesn’t take away any rights or benefits of gay or lesbian\ndomestic partnerships. Under California law, ‘domestic partners shall have\nthe same rights, protections, and benefits’ as married spouses. (Family\nCode § 297.5.) There are NO exceptions. Proposition 8 WILL NOT\nchange this.” Voter Information Guide at 56. Moreover, Strauss observed\n“that an alternative, much more sweeping initiative measure—proposing\nthe addition of a new constitutional section that would have provided not\nonly that ‘[o]nly marriage between one man and one woman is valid or\nrecognized in California,’ but also that ‘[n]either the Legislature nor any\ncourt, government institution, government agency, initiative statute, local\ngovernment, or government official shall . . . bestow statutory rights, inci-\ndents, or employee benefits of marriage on unmarried individuals’—was\ncirculated for signature at the same time as Proposition 8, but did not\nobtain sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.” 207 P.3d at 76 n.8.\n\f1632                        PERRY v. BROWN\nbearing that Proponents claim it might have been intended to\nhave. Accordingly, an interest in responsible procreation and\nchildbearing cannot provide a rational basis for the measure.\n\n   We add one final note. To the extent that it has been argued\nthat withdrawing from same-sex couples access to the desig-\nnation of ‘marriage’—without in any way altering the sub-\nstantive laws concerning their rights regarding childrearing or\nfamily formation—will encourage heterosexual couples to\nenter into matrimony, or will strengthen their matrimonial\nbonds, we believe that the People of California “could not\nreasonably” have “conceived” such an argument “to be true.”\nVance, 440 U.S. at 111. It is implausible to think that denying\ntwo men or two women the right to call themselves married\ncould somehow bolster the stability of families headed by one\nman and one woman. While deferential, the rational-basis\nstandard “is not a toothless one.” Mathews v. Lucas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109523\"><a href=\"/opinion/109523/mathews-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510 (1976). “[E]ven the standard of rationality . . . must\nfind some footing in the realities of the subject addressed by\nthe legislation.” Heller, 509 U.S. at 321. Here, the argument\nthat withdrawing the designation of ‘marriage’ from same-sex\ncouples could on its own promote the strength or stability of\nopposite-sex marital relationships lacks any such footing in\nreality.\n\n                                    2\n\n   [13] Proponents offer an alternative justification for Propo-\nsition 8: that it advances California’s interest in “proceed[ing]\nwith caution” when considering changes to the definition of\nmarriage. Proponents’ Br. 93. But this rationale, too, bears no\nconnection to the reality of Proposition 8. The amendment\nwas enacted after the State had provided same-sex couples the\nright to marry and after more than 18,000 couples had mar-\nried (and remain married even after Proposition 8, Strauss,\n207 P.3d at 122).23\n  23\n     The over 18,000 couples that did marry represented more than one-\nthird of all couples that had entered into registered domestic partnerships\n\f                            PERRY v. BROWN                            1633\n   Perhaps what Proponents mean is that California had an\ninterest in pausing at 18,000 married same-sex couples to\nevaluate whether same-sex couples should continue to be\nallowed to marry, or whether the same-sex marriages that had\nalready occurred were having any adverse impact on society.\nEven if that were so, there could be no rational connection\nbetween the asserted purpose of “proceeding with caution”\nand the enactment of an absolute ban, unlimited in time, on\nsame-sex marriage in the state constitution.24 To enact a con-\nstitutional prohibition is to adopt a fundamental barrier: it\nmeans that the legislative process, by which incremental poli-\ncymaking would normally proceed, is completely foreclosed.\nCf. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105285\"><a href=\"/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-okla-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n489 (1955) (observing that legislatures may rationally reform\npolicy “one step at a time”). Once Proposition 8 was enacted,\nany future steps forward, however cautious, would require\n“enlisting the citizenry of [California] to amend the State\nConstitution” once again. Romer, 517 U.S. at 631.\n\n   Had Proposition 8 imposed not a total ban but a time-\nspecific moratorium on same-sex marriages, during which the\nLegislature would have been authorized to consider the ques-\ntion in detail or at the end of which the People would have\nhad to vote again to renew the ban, the amendment might\nplausibly have been designed to “proceed with caution.” In\nthat case, we would have had to consider whether the objec-\ntive of “proceed[ing] with caution” was a legitimate one. But\nthat is not what Proposition 8 did. The amendment superseded\nthe Marriage Cases and then went further, by prohibiting the\n\nin California at the time. See Gary J. Gates et al., The Williams Institute,\nMarriage, Registration and Dissolution by Same-Sex Couples in the U.S.\n5 (July 2008) (noting that there were 48,157 registered domestic partner-\nships in California as of Spring 2008).\n   24\n      When the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified, the Nation was simi-\nlarly not interested in “proceeding with caution” in reallocating grain from\nwartime rations to alcohol production.

BROWN\nLegislature or even the People (except by constitutional\namendment) from choosing to make the designation of ‘mar-\nriage’ available to same-sex couples in the future. Such a per-\nmanent ban cannot be rationally related to an interest in\nproceeding with caution.\n\n   [14] In any event, in light of the express purpose of Propo-\nsition 8 and the campaign to enact it, it is not credible to sug-\ngest that “proceed[ing] with caution” was the reason the\nvoters adopted the measure. The purpose and effect of Propo-\nsition 8 was “to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to\nmarry in California”—not to “suspend” or “study” that right.\nVoter Information Guide at 54 (Proposition 8, Official Title\nand Summary) (emphasis added).25 The voters were told that\nProposition 8 would “overturn[ ]” the Marriage Cases “to\nRESTORE the meaning of marriage.” Id. at 56 (Argument in\nFavor of Proposition 8). The avowed purpose of Proposition\n8 was to return with haste to a time when same-sex couples\nwere barred from using the official designation of ‘marriage,’\nnot to study the matter further before deciding whether to\nmake the designation more equally available.\n\n                                   3\n\n   [15] We briefly consider two other potential rationales for\nProposition 8, not raised by Proponents but offered by amici\ncuriae. First is the argument that Proposition 8 advanced the\nState’s interest in protecting religious liberty. See, e.g., Br.\nAmicus Curiae of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty\n(Becket Br.) 2. There is no dispute that even before Proposi-\ntion 8, “no religion [was] required to change its religious poli-\ncies or practices with regard to same-sex couples, and no\nreligious officiant [was] required to solemnize a marriage in\n  25\n     In California, “[b]allot summaries . . . in the ‘Voter Information\nGuide’ are recognized sources for determining the voters’ intent.” People\nv.

Rather, the religious-liberty interest that Proposition 8\nsupposedly promoted was to decrease the likelihood that reli-\ngious organizations would be penalized, under California’s\nantidiscrimination laws and other government policies con-\ncerning sexual orientation, for refusing to provide services to\nfamilies headed by same-sex spouses. But Proposition 8 did\nnothing to affect those laws. To the extent that California’s\nantidiscrimination laws apply to various activities of religious\norganizations, their protections apply in the same way as\nbefore. Amicus’s argument is thus more properly read as an\nappeal to the Legislature, seeking reform of the State’s\nantidiscrimination laws to include greater accommodations\nfor religious organizations. See, e.g., Becket Br. 8 n.6\n(“Unlike many other states, California has no religious\nexemptions to its statutory bans on gender, marital status, and\nsexual orientation discrimination in public accommoda-\ntions.”). This argument is in no way addressed by Proposition\n8 and could not have been the reason for Proposition 8.\n\n   [16] Second is the argument, prominent during the cam-\npaign to pass Proposition 8, that it would “protect[ ] our chil-\ndren from being taught in public schools that ‘same-sex\nmarriage’ is the same as traditional marriage.” Perry IV, 704\nF. Supp. 2d at 930, 989-90 (quoting the Voter Information\nGuide at 56) (emphasis omitted); see Br. Amicus Curiae for\nthe Hausvater Project 13-15. Yet again, California law belies\nthe premise of this justification. Both before and after Propo-\nsition 8, schools have not been required to teach anything\nabout same-sex marriage. They “may . . . elect[ ] to offer\ncomprehensive sexual health education”; only then might they\nbe required to “teach respect for marriage and committed rela-\ntionships.” Cal. Educ. Code § 51933(a)-(b), (b)(7). Both\nbefore and after Proposition 8, schools have retained control\nover the content of such lessons. And both before and after\nProposition 8, schools and individual teachers have been pro-\nhibited from giving any instruction that discriminates on the\n\f1636                     PERRY v. BROWN\nbasis of sexual orientation; now as before, students could not\nbe taught the superiority or inferiority of either same- or\nopposite-sex marriage or other “committed relationships.”\nCal. Educ. Code §§ 51500, 51933(b)(4). The Marriage Cases\ntherefore did not weaken, and Proposition 8 did not\nstrengthen, the rights of schools to control their curricula and\nof parents to control their children’s education.\n\n   There is a limited sense in which the extension of the desig-\nnation ‘marriage’ to same-sex partnerships might alter the\ncontent of the lessons that schools choose to teach. Schools\nteach about the world as it is; when the world changes, les-\nsons change. A shift in the State’s marriage law may therefore\naffect the content of classroom instruction just as would the\nelection of a new governor, the discovery of a new chemical\nelement, or the adoption of a new law permitting no-fault\ndivorce: students learn about these as empirical facts of the\nworld around them. But to protest the teaching of these facts\nis little different from protesting their very existence; it is like\nopposing the election of a particular governor on the ground\nthat students would learn about his holding office, or oppos-\ning the legitimation of no-fault divorce because a teacher\nmight allude to that fact if a course in societal structure were\ntaught to graduating seniors. The prospect of children learning\nabout the laws of the State and society’s assessment of the\nlegal rights of its members does not provide an independent\nreason for stripping members of a disfavored group of those\nrights they presently enjoy.\n\n                                 4\n\n   Proposition 8’s only effect, we have explained, was to\nwithdraw from gays and lesbians the right to employ the des-\nignation of ‘marriage’ to describe their committed relation-\nships and thus to deprive them of a societal status that affords\ndignity to those relationships. Proposition 8 could not have\nreasonably been enacted to promote childrearing by biological\nparents, to encourage responsible procreation, to proceed with\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1637\ncaution in social change, to protect religious liberty, or to con-\ntrol the education of schoolchildren. Simply taking away the\ndesignation of ‘marriage,’ while leaving in place all the sub-\nstantive rights and responsibilities of same-sex partners, did\nnot do any of the things its Proponents now suggest were its\npurposes. Proposition 8 “is so far removed from these particu-\nlar justifications that we find it impossible to credit them.”\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 635. We therefore need not, and do not,\ndecide whether any of these purported rationales for the law\nwould be “legitimate,” id. at 632, or would suffice to justify\nProposition 8 if the amendment actually served to further\nthem.\n\n                                E\n\n                                1\n\n   We are left to consider why else the People of California\nmight have enacted a constitutional amendment that takes\naway from gays and lesbians the right to use the designation\nof ‘marriage.’ One explanation is the desire to revert to the\nway things were prior to the Marriage Cases, when ‘mar-\nriage’ was available only to opposite-sex couples, as had been\nthe case since the founding of the State and in other jurisdic-\ntions long before that. This purpose is one that Proposition 8\nactually did accomplish: it “restore[d] the traditional defini-\ntion of marriage as referring to a union between a man and a\nwoman.” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 76. But tradition alone is not a\njustification for taking away a right that had already been\ngranted, even though that grant was in derogation of tradition.\nIn Romer, it did not matter that at common law, gays and les-\nbians were afforded no protection from discrimination in the\nprivate sphere; Amendment 2 could not be justified on the\nbasis that it simply repealed positive law and restored the “tra-\nditional” state of affairs. 517 U.S. at 627-29. Precisely the\nsame is true here.\n\n  Laws may be repealed and new rights taken away if they\nhave had unintended consequences or if there is some con-\n\f1638                     PERRY v. BROWN\nceivable affirmative good that revocation would produce, cf.\nCrawford, 458 U.S. at 539-40, but new rights may not be\nstripped away solely because they are new. Tradition is a\nlegitimate consideration in policymaking, of course, but it\ncannot be an end unto itself. Cf. Williams v.

Under Romer, we must infer from Proposition 8’s effect\non California law that the People took away from gays and\nlesbians the right to use the official designation of ‘marriage’\n—and the societal status that accompanies it—because they\ndisapproved of these individuals as a class and did not wish\nthem to receive the same official recognition and societal\napproval of their committed relationships that the State makes\navailable to opposite-sex couples.\n\n   [18] It will not do to say that Proposition 8 was intended\nonly to disapprove of same-sex marriage, rather than to pass\njudgment on same-sex couples as people. Just as the criminal-\nization of “homosexual conduct . . . is an invitation to subject\nhomosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and\nin the private spheres,” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 575, so too\ndoes the elimination of the right to use the official designation\nof ‘marriage’ for the relationships of committed same-sex\ncouples send a message that gays and lesbians are of lesser\nworth as a class—that they enjoy a lesser societal status.\nIndeed, because laws affecting gays and lesbians’ rights often\nregulate individual conduct—what sexual activity people may\nundertake in the privacy of their own homes, or who is per-\nmitted to marry whom—as much as they regulate status, the\nSupreme Court has “declined to distinguish between status\nand conduct in [the] context” of sexual orientation.

By\nwithdrawing the availability of the recognized designation of\n‘marriage,’ Proposition 8 enacts nothing more or less than a\njudgment about the worth and dignity of gays and lesbians as\na class.\n\n   [19] Just as a “desire to harm . . . cannot constitute a legiti-\nmate governmental interest,” Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534, nei-\nther can a more basic disapproval of a class of people. Romer,\n\f1640                        PERRY v. BROWN\n517 U.S. at 633-35. “The issue is whether the majority may\nuse the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole\nsociety” through a law that abridges minority individuals’\nrights. Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 571. It may not. Without more,\n“[m]oral disapproval of [a] group, like a bare desire to harm\nthe group, is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational\nbasis review under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 582\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). Society does sometimes draw\nclassifications that likely are rooted partially in disapproval,\nsuch as a law that grants educational benefits to veterans but\ndenies them to conscientious objectors who engaged in alter-\nnative civilian service. See Johnson, 415 U.S. at 362-64.\nThose classifications will not be invalidated so long as they\ncan be justified by reference to some independent purpose\nthey serve; in Johnson, they could provide an incentive for\nmilitary service and direct assistance to those who needed the\nmost help in readjusting to post-war life, see id. at 376-83.\nEnacting a rule into law based solely on the disapproval of a\ngroup, however, “is a classification of persons undertaken for\nits own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not\npermit.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 635. Like Amendment 2, Propo-\nsition 8 is a classification of gays and lesbians undertaken for\nits own sake.\n\n                                    2\n\n   The “inference” that Proposition 8 was born of disapproval\nof gays and lesbians is heightened by evidence of the context\nin which the measure was passed.26 The district court found\nthat “[t]he campaign to pass Proposition 8 relied on stereo-\n  26\n     A contextual evaluation is both useful and appropriate as part of the\n“careful consideration” in which courts must engage when faced with\n“[d]iscriminations of an unusual character.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted); see Moreno, 413 U.S. at 533-38. When a\nlaw is enacted by ballot initiative, we look to objective indicators of the\nvoters’ motivations, such as campaign materials, to shed light on the “his-\ntorical context.” S.

Supp. 2d at 990.\nTelevision and print advertisements “focused on . . . the con-\ncern that people of faith and religious groups would somehow\nbe harmed by the recognition of gay marriage” and “conveyed\na message that gay people and relationships are inferior, that\nhomosexuality is undesirable and that children need to be pro-\ntected from exposure to gay people and their relationships.”\nId. These messages were not crafted accidentally. The strate-\ngists responsible for the campaign in favor of Proposition 8\nlater explained their approach: “ ‘[T]here were limits to the\ndegree of tolerance Californians would afford the gay com-\nmunity. They would entertain allowing gay marriage, but not\nif doing so had significant implications for the rest of soci-\nety,’ ” such as what children would be taught in school. Id. at\n988 (quoting Frank Schubert & Jeff Flint, Passing Prop 8,\nPolitics, Feb. 2009, at 45-47). Nor were these messages new;\nfor decades, ballot measures regarding homosexuality have\nbeen presented to voters in terms designed to appeal to stereo-\ntypes of gays and lesbians as predators, threats to children,\nand practitioners of a deviant “lifestyle.” See Br. Amicus\nCuriae of Constitutional Law Professors at 2-8. The messages\npresented here mimic those presented to Colorado voters in\nsupport of Amendment 2, such as, “Homosexual indoctrina-\ntion in the schools? IT’S HAPPENING IN COLORADO!”\nColorado for Family Values, Equal Rights—Not Special\nRights, at 2 (1992), reprinted in Robert Nagel, Playing\nDefense, 6 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 167, 193 (1997).\n\n   [20] When directly enacted legislation “singl[es] out a cer-\ntain class of citizens for disfavored legal status,” we must “in-\nsist on knowing the relation between the classification\nadopted and the object to be attained,” so that we may ensure\nthat the law exists “to further a proper legislative end” rather\nthan “to make the[ ] [class] unequal to everyone else.” Romer,\n517 U.S. at 632-33, 635. Proposition 8 fails this test. Its sole\npurpose and effect is “to eliminate the right of same-sex cou-\nples to marry in California”—to dishonor a disfavored group\n\f1642                    PERRY v. BROWN\nby taking away the official designation of approval of their\ncommitted relationships and the accompanying societal status,\nand nothing more. Voter Information Guide at 54. “It is at\nonce too narrow and too broad,” for it changes the law far too\nlittle to have any of the effects it purportedly was intended to\nyield, yet it dramatically reduces the societal standing of gays\nand lesbians and diminishes their dignity. Romer, 517 U.S. at\n633. Proposition 8 did not result from a legitimate “Kultur-\nkampf” concerning the structure of families in California,\nbecause it had no effect on family structure, but in order to\nstrike it down, we need not go so far as to find that it was\nenacted in “a fit of spite.” Id. at 636 (Scalia, J., dissenting).\nIt is enough to say that Proposition 8 operates with no appar-\nent purpose but to impose on gays and lesbians, through the\npublic law, a majority’s private disapproval of them and their\nrelationships, by taking away from them the official designa-\ntion of ‘marriage,’ with its societally recognized status. Prop-\nosition 8 therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                               VI\n\n   Finally, we address Proponents’ motion to vacate the dis-\ntrict court’s judgment. On April 6, 2011, after resigning from\nthe bench, former Chief Judge Walker disclosed that he was\ngay and that he had for the past ten years been in a relation-\nship with another man. Proponents moved shortly thereafter\nto vacate the judgment on the basis that 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(4)\nobligated Chief Judge Walker to recuse himself, because he\nhad an “interest that could be substantially affected by the\noutcome of the proceeding,” and that 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) obli-\ngated him either to recuse himself or to disclose his potential\nconflict, because “his impartiality might reasonably be ques-\ntioned.” Chief Judge Ware, to whom this case was assigned\nafter Chief Judge Walker’s retirement, denied the motion after\nreceiving briefs and hearing argument.\n\n  The district court properly held that it had jurisdiction to\nhear and deny the motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1(a), that\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1643\nthe motion was timely, and that Chief Judge Walker had no\nobligation to recuse himself under either § 455(b)(4) or\n§ 455(a) or to disclose any potential conflict. As Chief Judge\nWare explained, the fact that a judge “could be affected by the\noutcome of a proceeding[,] in the same way that other mem-\nbers of the general public would be affected, is not a basis for\neither recusal or disqualification under Section 455(b)(4).”\nPerry v.

Nor could it possibly be “reason-\nable to presume,” for the purposes of § 455(a), “that a judge\nis incapable of making an impartial decision about the consti-\ntutionality of a law, solely because, as a citizen, the judge\ncould be affected by the proceeding.” 790 F.

To hold otherwise would demonstrate a lack\nof respect for the integrity of our federal courts.\n\n   [21] The denial of the motion to vacate was premised on\nChief Judge Ware’s finding that Chief Judge Walker was not\nobligated to recuse himself. “We review the district court’s\ndenial of a motion to vacate the judgment for an abuse of dis-\ncretion.” Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785920\"><a href=\"/opinion/785920/jeff-d-john-m-paula-e-dusty-r-minors-individually-and-on-behalf-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 850 (9th Cir.\n2004). Our standard for abuse of discretion requires us to (1)\n“look to whether the trial court identified and applied the cor-\nrect legal rule to the relief requested”; and, if the trial court\napplied the correct legal rule, to (2) “look to whether the trial\ncourt’s resolution . . . resulted from a factual finding that was\nillogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that\nmay be drawn from the facts in the record.” United States v.\nHinkson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1191667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1191667/united-states-v-hinkson/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1263 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc).\nHere, Chief Judge Ware did not incorrectly apply the law. He\nidentified and applied § 455(b)(4) and § 455(a), the correct\nlegal rules, as well as the relevant precedents. His application\nof the law, determining whether Chief Judge Walker was obli-\ngated to recuse himself, was discretionary. See United States\n\f1644                    PERRY v. BROWN\nv. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150077\"><a href=\"/opinion/150077/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1147-48 (9th Cir. 2010). His reso-\nlution of the issue on the basis of the facts was not illogical,\nimplausible, or without support in inferences that may be\ndrawn from the facts in the record. Thus, we affirm Chief\nJudge Ware’s decision not to grant the motion to vacate.\n\n                               VII\n\n   By using their initiative power to target a minority group\nand withdraw a right that it possessed, without a legitimate\nreason for doing so, the People of California violated the\nEqual Protection Clause. We hold Proposition 8 to be uncon-\nstitutional on this ground. We do not doubt the importance of\nthe more general questions presented to us concerning the\nrights of same-sex couples to marry, nor do we doubt that\nthese questions will likely be resolved in other states, and for\nthe nation as a whole, by other courts. For now, it suffices to\nconclude that the People of California may not, consistent\nwith the Federal Constitution, add to their state constitution a\nprovision that has no more practical effect than to strip gays\nand lesbians of their right to use the official designation that\nthe State and society give to committed relationships, thereby\nadversely affecting the status and dignity of the members of\na disfavored class. The judgment of the district court is\n\n  AFFIRMED.27\n\n\n\n\n  27\n   The stay pending appeal issued by this court on August 16, 2010\nremains in effect pending issuance of the mandate.\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                     1645\nN.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part:\n\n   I agree with the majority’s analysis and decisions in parts\nIII and VI of its opinion, determining that (1) the Proponents\nhave standing to bring this appeal; and (2) the Motion to\nVacate the Judgment should be denied. Because I do not\nagree with the majority’s analysis of other topics regarding\nthe constitutionality of Proposition 8, I have chosen to write\nseparately. Ultimately, I am not convinced that Proposition 8\nis not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nI must therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n   Before addressing the issues now presented before our\npanel, I want to emphasize a distinguishing point in my analy-\nsis from what may be anticipated by the reader. Similar to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court in its prior opinion concerning\nProposition 8, our panel was not tasked with determining\nwhether this constitutional amendment “is wise or sound as a\nmatter of policy or whether we, as individuals, believe it\nshould be a part of the California Constitution.” Strauss v.\nHorton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (Cal. 2009). Our personal views\nregarding the political and sociological debate on marriage\nequality are irrelevant to our task. Instead, we are only asked\nto consider the constitutional validity of Proposition 8 under\nthe federal Constitution. The California Supreme Court has\nalready interpreted and applied “the principles and rules\nembodied in the California Constitution” to Proposition 8 and\nfound it valid. Strauss, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                               I.\n\n   Proponents and their supporting amici (hereinafter Propo-\nnents) argue that the United States Supreme Court’s summary\ndismissal in Baker v. Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972) (mem.),\n“mandates reversal of the district court’s ruling.” According\nto Proponents, the claims raised here are the same as those\nrejected in Baker, and the claims are therefore foreclosed by\n\f1646                     PERRY v. BROWN\nthat decision. The majority dispenses with Baker in a foot-\nnote. However, other federal courts have indicated that Baker,\nif it is not controlling, at least stands for exercising “restraint”\nwhen it comes to addressing due process and equal protection\nchallenges against laws prohibiting marriage by same-sex\ncouples.

BROWN\n      riage from same-sex couples, and its purpose is to\n      remove the taint that its supporters believed the\n      inclusion of lesbian and gay couples worked on the\n      institution of marriage.\n\n   The equal protection question raised in this case seems to\nbe distinguishable from the precise issues presented and nec-\nessarily decided in Baker, especially when the equal protec-\ntion issue is framed as San Francisco advocates.1 The equal\nprotection issue decided in Baker rested on whether Minneso-\nta’s “refusal, pursuant to Minnesota marriage statutes, to sanc-\ntify appellants’ marriage . . . violates their rights under the\nequal protection clause . . . .” In re Kandu, 315 B.R. at 137.\nHere, San Francisco presents the issue of whether Proposition\n8’s effect of “remov[ing] the honored title ‘marriage’ but not\nthe incident of marriage from same-sex couples” violates\nequal protection. This Proposition 8 issue may have “merely\nlurk[ed] in the record” of Baker. Unlike Minnesota, California\ngranted same-sex couples rights to both the designation and\nthe incidents of marriage, before withdrawing the right of\naccess to the designation through Proposition 8. Therefore,\n  1\n    Whether prohibiting marriage by same-sex couples violates due pro-\ncess was an issue presented and decided in Baker v. Nelson. In this case,\nthe district court determined that “plaintiffs seek to exercise their funda-\nmental right to marry under the Due Process Clause,” Perry v. Schwar-\nzenegger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440578\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440578/perry-v-schwarzenegger/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Cal. 2010), and that Proposition\n8 violated the Due Process Clause, because it denied Plaintiffs this funda-\nmental right and did not withstand strict scrutiny. Id. at 994-95. But in\nBaker, the Minnesota Supreme Court determined that prohibiting marriage\nby same-sex couples did not offend the Due Process Clause. 191 N.W.3d\nat 186-87. Because the United States Supreme Court “branded [that] ques-\ntion as unsubstantial” in its summary dismissal, the due process issue “re-\nmains so except when doctrinal developments indicate otherwise.” Hicks\nv. Miranda, 422 U.S. at 344 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nUnited States Supreme Court cases following Baker do not suggest any\nsuch doctrinal developments have occurred.

BROWN                      1651\nthe constitutionality of withdrawing from same-sex couples\nthe right of access to the designation of marriage does not\nseem to be among the “specific challenges” raised in Baker.\nIf so, though the precedential effect of Baker v. Nelson is not\nchallenged by this decision, such precedent is distinguishable\nfrom the decision of the district court here.\n\n                               II.\n\n   In deciding this case, one should be mindful that generally\nstate governance over marriage is not challenged easily. How-\never, while “marriage is a social relation subject to the State’s\npolice power,” this does not mean that the State’s “powers to\nregulate marriage are unlimited notwithstanding the com-\nmands of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Loving v. Virginia,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1967). A marriage regulation “containing racial\nclassifications,” such as the one at issue in Loving, is subject\nto “the very heavy burden of justification which the Four-\nteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes\ndrawn according to race.” Id. at 9. However, not “every state\nregulation which relates in any way to the incidents of or pre-\nrequisites for marriage must be subjected to rigorous scruti-\nny.” Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 386 (majority opinion). Proposition\n8 does not involve such a suspect classification and therefore\nshould not be analyzed under any heightened scrutiny, but we\nmust still ask “whether there is any rational foundation for the\ndiscrimination[ ] . . . .” See Loving, 388 U.S. at 9.\n\n                               A.\n\n   The Plaintiffs, San Francisco, and their supporting amici\n(hereinafter Plaintiffs) challenge Proposition 8 under the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. How-\never, because Proposition 8 is “a classification neither involv-\ning fundamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines,”\nHeller v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1993), I do not address the\napplication of strict scrutiny review to Proposition 8. Under\nstrict scrutiny review, the government would need to establish\n\f1652                    PERRY v. BROWN\nthat the classification is necessary to achieve a compelling\ngovernmental interest, and there must not be a less onerous\navailable alternative. The United States Supreme Court has\nnot recognized that the fundamental right to marry includes a\nfundamental right to gay marriage. See Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n578. Gays and lesbians are not a suspect or quasi-suspect\nclass. High Tech Gays v. Def. Indus. Sec.

See id. at 441.\n\n   Thus, Proposition 8 is subject to rational basis review rather\nthan to any heightened scrutiny. See id. at 440-42.\n\n                               B.\n\n   “The Fourteenth Amendment’s promise that no person\nshall be denied the equal protection of the laws must coexist\nwith the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for\none purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various\ngroups or persons.” Romer v.

Thus, when assessing the constitutionality of most\ngovernment measures, we use rational basis review in an\nattempt “to reconcile the principle with the reality.” Id. Under\nrational basis review, “we will uphold the legislative classifi-\ncation so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate\nend.” Id.\n\n   In equal protection analysis, rational basis review “is not a\nlicense for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of\nlegislative choices.” Heller, 509 U.S. at 319 (internal quota-\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                       1653\ntion marks omitted). A classification “neither involving fun-\ndamental rights nor proceeding along suspect lines is\naccorded a strong presumption of validity.” Id. “Such a classi-\nfication cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if\nthere is a rational relationship between the disparity of treat-\nment and some legitimate governmental purpose.” Id. at 320.\nThe government is not required to “actually articulate at any\ntime the purpose or rationale supporting its classification”;\nrather, a classification “must be upheld against equal protec-\ntion challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of\nfacts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.”\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   Additionally, the government “has no obligation to provide\nevidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classifica-\ntion.” Id. The measure at issue “is not subject to courtroom\nfactfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsup-\nported by evidence or empirical data.” Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “[T]he burden is on the one attacking the leg-\nislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis\nwhich might support it . . . .” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Further, a legislature’s generalizations may pass\nrational basis review “even when there is an imperfect fit\nbetween means and ends.” Id. at 321. In sum, the measure\nneed only have “arguable” assumptions underlying its “plau-\nsible rationales” to survive constitutional challenge. Id. at\n333.\n\n   However, “even the standard of rationality . . . must find\nsome footing in the realities of the subject addressed by the\nlegislation.” Id. at 321. Also, some interests are not legitimate\ngovernmental interests. E.g., Romer, 517 U.S. at 634 (stating\nthat “animosity toward the class of persons affected” is not a\nlegitimate governmental interest); Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448\n(stating that “mere negative attitudes, or fear” are not legiti-\nmate governmental interests); U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v.

BROWN\nharm a politically unpopular group” is not a legitimate gov-\nernmental interest).\n\n   As a general rule, states may use their police power to regu-\nlate the “morals” of their population. See, e.g., Berman v. Par-\nker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105244\"><a href=\"/opinion/105244/berman-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (1954). In his dissent in Lawrence, 539\nU.S. at 589-91 (Scalia, J., dissenting), Justice Scalia argued\nthat “[c]ountless judicial decisions and legislative enactments\nhave relied on the ancient proposition that a governing major-\nity’s belief that certain sexual behavior is ‘immoral and unac-\nceptable’ constitutes a rational basis for regulation.” Id. at\n589. He then suggested that the Supreme Court has relied on\nmorality as the basis for its decision making and states,\n“[s]tate laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest,\nprostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality,\nand obscenity are likewise sustainable only in light of valida-\ntion of laws based on moral choices.” Id. at 590.\n\n   However, Justice O’Connor articulated a different perspec-\ntive in determining whether moral disapproval may serve as\na rational basis for equal protection. She outlined that moral\ndisapproval is not a legitimate state interest to justify, by\nitself, a statute that bans homosexual conduct. She stated that\n“[m]oral disapproval of this group, like a bare desire to harm\nthe group, is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational\nbasis review under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 582\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). She continued: “Indeed, we have\nnever held that moral disapproval, without any other asserted\nstate interest, is a sufficient rationale under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause to justify a law that discriminates among groups\nof persons.” Id. The Lawrence majority opinion seems to have\nimplicitly agreed with Justice O’Connor, when it stated that\na court’s “obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to man-\ndate its own moral code.” Id. at 559 (majority opinion) (inter-\nnal quotation mark omitted).\n\n   Therefore, such interests (e.g., animus, negative attitudes,\nfear, a bare desire to harm, and moral disapproval) alone will\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                      1655\nnot support the constitutionality of a measure, because the\nEqual Protection Clause does not permit a “status-based\nenactment divorced from any factual context from which [the\ncourts] could discern a relationship to legitimate state inter-\nests,” or a “classification of persons undertaken for its own\nsake . . . .” Romer, 517 U.S. at 635.\n\n                              III.\n\n   The majority concludes that “Romer governs our analysis\nnotwithstanding the differences between Amendment 2 and\nProposition 8,” because of the similarities between the mea-\nsures at issue in Romer and in the present case. However, the\ndifferences between Amendment 2 and Proposition 8 indicate\nthat Romer does not directly control our analysis of the consti-\ntutionality of Proposition 8.\n\n   Before comparing Amendment 2 to Proposition 8, I want\nto attempt to clarify the extent of the Plaintiffs’ interest\nasserted here. One must understand the unique manner in\nwhich California defines this interest. Because the California\nSupreme Court defined and clarified that interest in its Strauss\nv. Horton opinion, I quote liberally from it.\n\n   Proposition 8 “properly must be understood as having a\nconsiderably narrower scope and more limited effect” than\nwhat might be the case in other states. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61.\n“Proposition 8 does not entirely repeal or abrogate the aspect\nof a same-sex couple’s state constitutional right to . . . choose\none’s life partner and enter with that person into a committed,\nofficially recognized, and protected family relationship that\nenjoys all of the constitutionally based incidents of marriage.”\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Nor does Proposition 8 fundamentally alter the\n    meaning and substance of state constitutional equal\n    protection principles . . . . Instead, the measure\n    carves out a narrow and limited exception to these\n\f1656                     PERRY v. BROWN\n      state constitutional rights, reserving the official des-\n      ignation of the term “marriage” for the union of\n      opposite-sex couples as a matter of state constitu-\n      tional law, but leaving undisturbed all of the other\n      extremely significant substantive aspects of a same-\n      sex couple’s state constitutional right to establish an\n      officially recognized and protected family relation-\n      ship and the guarantee of equal protection of the\n      laws.\n\nId.\n\n  Further, the California Supreme Court continued, “as a\nqualitative matter, the act of limiting access to the designation\nof marriage to opposite-sex couples [through Proposition 8]\ndoes not have a substantial or, indeed, even a minimal effect\non the governmental plan or framework of California that\nexisted prior to the amendment.” Id. at 62.\n\n   However, the California Supreme Court was also quick to\npoint out that this differentiation did not diminish or minimize\n“the significance of the official designation of ‘marriage,’ ”\nwhich they characterized as “a vital factor” in their prior deci-\nsion holding that failing to provide access to this designation\nto same-sex couples “impinged upon the privacy and due pro-\ncess rights of same-sex couples and violated those couples’\nright to the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the\nCalifornia Constitution.” Id. at 59, 61.\n\n   Therefore, “Proposition 8 reasonably must be interpreted in\na limited fashion as eliminating only the right of same-sex\ncouples to equal access to the designation of marriage, and as\nnot otherwise affecting the constitutional right of those cou-\nples to establish an officially recognized family relationship.”\nId. at 76.\n\n      Accordingly, although Proposition 8 eliminates the\n      ability of same-sex couples to enter into an official\n\f                         PERRY v. BROWN                       1657\n    relationship designated “marriage,” in all other\n    respects those couples continue to possess, under the\n    state constitutional privacy and due process clauses,\n    “the core set of basic substantive legal rights and\n    attributes traditionally associated with marriage,”\n    including, “most fundamentally, the opportunity of\n    an individual to establish—with the person with\n    whom the individual has chose to share his or her\n    life—an officially recognized and protected family\n    possessing mutual rights and responsibilities and\n    entitled to the same respect and dignity accorded a\n    union traditionally designated as marriage.” Like\n    opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples enjoy this\n    protection not as a matter of legislative grace, but of\n    constitutional right.\n\nId. at 77 (citation omitted).\n\n                                A.\n\n   In Romer, Colorado voters adopted Amendment 2 to the\nState Constitution, which “prohibits all legislative, executive,\nor judicial action at any level of state or local government\ndesigned to protect . . . gays and lesbians.’ ” 517 U.S. at 624.\nAmendment 2 was passed in response to municipal ordi-\nnances enacted in various Colorado cities that protected “per-\nsons discriminated against by reason of their sexual\norientation.” Id. The Supreme Court examined Amendment 2\nunder rational basis review, where “if a law neither burdens\na fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold\nthe legislative classification so long as it bears a rational rela-\ntion to some legitimate end.” Id. at 631. The Supreme Court\nheld that Amendment 2 failed rational basis review for two\nreasons. Id. at 632. “First, the amendment has the peculiar\nproperty of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability\non a single named group, an exceptional and . . . invalid form\nof legislation.” Id. “Second, its sheer breadth is so discontinu-\nous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems\n\f1658                     PERRY v. BROWN\ninexplicable by anything but animus toward the class if\naffects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state inter-\nests.” Id.\n\n                                B.\n\n   There are several ways to distinguish Romer from the pres-\nent case. First, in Romer, the Supreme Court stated that “[t]he\nchange Amendment 2 works in the legal status of gays and\nlesbians in the private sphere is far reaching, both on its own\nterms and when considered in light of the structure and opera-\ntion of modern anti-discrimination laws.” Id. at 627. Here,\n“Proposition 8 reasonably must be interpreted in a limited\nfashion as eliminating only the right of same-sex couples to\nequal access to the designation of marriage, and as not other-\nwise affecting the constitutional right of those couples to\nestablish an officially recognized family relationship.”\nStrauss, 207 P.3d at 76. Thus, Romer is inapposite, because\nProposition 8 eliminates the right of access to the designation\nof marriage from same-sex couples, rather than working a far\nreaching change in their legal status.\n\n   Second, Amendment 2’s “sheer breadth is so discontinuous\nwith the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inex-\nplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects.”\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 632. Again, Proposition 8 “carves out a\nnarrow and limited exception to [the] state constitutional\nrights” of privacy and due process. Strauss, 207 P.3d at 61.\nProposition 8 therefore lacks the “sheer breadth” that\nprompted the Supreme Court to raise the inference of animus\nin Romer.\n\n   The effect of animus is also unclear. In Romer, the\nSupreme Court stated that “laws of the kind now before us\nraise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is\nborn of animosity towards the class of persons affected.” 517\nU.S. at 634. The Supreme Court indicated that Amendment 2\nwas constitutionally invalid, because its only purpose was ani-\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                     1659\nmus; Amendment 2 was not “directed to any identifiable\nlegitimate purpose or discrete objective.” Id. at 635. In short,\nRomer was a case where the only basis for the measure at\nissue was animus. However, in a case where the measure at\nissue was prompted both by animus and by some independent\nlegitimate purpose, the measure may still be constitutionally\nvalid. The Supreme Court has stated that while “negative atti-\ntudes,” “fear” or other biases “may often accompany irratio-\nnal (and therefore unconstitutional) discrimination, their\npresence alone does not a constitutional violation make.” Bd.\nof Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367\n(2001) (discussing Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448). If “animus” is\none such bias, its presence alone may not make Proposition\n8 invalid if the measure also rationally relates to a legitimate\ngovernmental interest.\n\n   Finally, gays and lesbians were burdened by Amendment 2,\nbecause it “operate[d] to repeal and forbid all laws or policies\nproviding specific protection for gays or lesbians from dis-\ncrimination by every level of Colorado government.” Romer,\n517 U.S. at 629. In contrast, “although Proposition 8 elimi-\nnates the ability of same-sex couples to enter into an official\nrelationship designated ‘marriage,’ in all other respects those\ncouples continue to possess, under the state constitutional pri-\nvacy and due process clauses, the core set of basic substantive\nlegal rights and attributes traditionally associated with mar-\nriage . . . .” Strauss, 207 P.3d at 77 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Put otherwise, Proposition 8 does not burden gays\nand lesbians to the same extent Amendment 2 burdened gays\nand lesbians in Colorado.\n\n                              C.\n\n   Proponents argue that the fact that Proposition 8 withdrew\nfrom same-sex couples the existing right of access to the des-\nignation of marriage should be significant in our constitu-\ntional analysis. However, Supreme Court equal protection\ncases involving challenges to measures withdrawing an exist-\n\f1660                         PERRY v. BROWN\ning right do not indicate that the withdrawal should affect our\nanalysis. Instead, it seems that the court has upheld legislation\nthat withdraws, rather than reserves, some legal right. E.g.,\nU.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176-77 (1980)\n(applying “traditional” principles of rational basis review to\nCongress’s determination “that some of those who in the past\nreceived full windfall benefits would not continue to do so”);\nCity of New Orleans v.

In fact, in its decision in Romer,\nthe Supreme Court does not base its decision on this conten-\ntion. Rather, it mentioned withdrawing specific legal protec-\ntions from gays and lesbians only in the context of referring\nto the irrational targeting of that group when compared to the\nsweeping change Amendment 2 created in the law.2 Romer,\n517 U.S. at 627.\n\n                                     D.\n\n   The above differences between Amendment 2 and Proposi-\ntion 8 indicate that Romer does not directly control here. In\nRomer, the Supreme Court found that animus alone was the\npurpose behind Amendment 2. Here, the majority backs into\nits inference of animus, first determining that all other bases\n   2\n     However, while the withdrawal of a right may not be analytically sig-\nnificant for rational basis review, it may still be factually significant. For\nexample, the fact that Proposition 8 involves the withdrawal of an existing\nright and not the extension of a previously reserved right suggests that\nJohnson v. Robison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), is inapposite to the present case.\nIn Johnson, the Supreme Court declared that “[w]hen . . . the inclusion of\none group promotes a legitimate governmental purpose, and the addition\nof other groups would not, we cannot say that the statute’s classification\nof beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries is invidiously discriminatory.” Id. at\n383. As the majority argues, the rule from Johnson appears to be inappli-\ncable here, because Proposition 8 involves the withdrawal from same-sex\ncouples of the existing right to access the designation of marriage, and not\nthe addition of same-sex couples to the group previously reserved the\nright.\n\f                       PERRY v. BROWN                     1661\nfor Proposition 8 are constitutionally invalid. Assuming ani-\nmus or moral disapproval were one of the purposes of Propo-\nsition 8, the measure would still survive rational basis review\nif there were also a valid rational basis behind Proposition 8.\nOnly if there were no other basis would Proposition 8 fail\nrational basis review. Thus, our task is to determine whether\nProposition 8 rationally relates to any independent legitimate\ngovernmental interest.\n\n                             IV.\n\n   In our case, Proponents argue that Proposition 8, defining\nmarriage as the union of one man and one woman, is ratio-\nnally related to a legitimate governmental interest for several\nreasons. Some of those reasons have already been discussed\nin the majority opinion and need no further discussion here.\nHowever, two of those reasons deserve more discussion,\nbecause they have been credited by other courts: (1) a respon-\nsible procreation theory, justifying the inducement of marital\nrecognition only for opposite-sex couples, because it “steers\nprocreation into marriage” because opposite-sex couples are\nthe only couples who can procreate children accidentally or\nirresponsibly; and (2) an optimal parenting theory, justifying\nthe inducement of marital recognition only for opposite-sex\ncouples, because the family structure of two committed bio-\nlogical parents—one man and one woman—is the optimal\npartnership for raising children. See, e.g., Citizens for Equal\nProtection, 455 F.3d at 867-68.\n\n                              A.\n\n   Proponents argue that Proposition 8, defining marriage as\nthe union of one man and one woman, preserves the funda-\nmental and historical purposes of marriage. They argue that,\nif the definition of marriage between a man and a woman is\nchanged, it would fundamentally redefine the term from its\noriginal and historical procreative purpose. This shift in pur-\npose would weaken society’s perception of the importance of\n\f1662                        PERRY v. BROWN\nentering into marriage to have children, which would increase\nthe likelihood that couples would choose to cohabitate rather\nthan to get married. They also argue that irresponsible procre-\nation, by accident or willfully in a cohabitation relationship,\nwill result in less stable circumstances for children and that\nsame-sex couples do not present this threat of irresponsible\nprocreation. They argue that, in the case of unintended preg-\nnancies, the question is not whether the child will be raised by\ntwo opposite-sex parents, but rather whether it will be raised,\non the one hand by two parents, or on the other hand by its\nmother alone (often with the assistance of the state). “Proposi-\ntion 8 seeks to channel potentially procreative conduct into\nrelationships where that conduct is likely to further, rather\nthan harm, society’s interest in responsible procreation and\nchildrearing.”\n\n   Proponents also argue the “optimal parenting” rationale\nserves as a rational basis for Proposition 8. The optimal par-\nenting rationale posits that Proposition 8 promotes the optimal\nsetting for the responsible raising and care of children—by\ntheir biological parents in a stable marriage relationship. Pro-\nponents offer many judicial decisions and secondary authori-\nties supporting both rationales.\n\n   In sum, Proponents argue that Proposition 8 is rationally\nrelated to legitimate governmental interests.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   The first requirement of rational basis review is that there\nmust be some conceivable legitimate governmental interest\nfor the measure at issue.3\n  3\n   This requirement is easily met, because “[v]irtually any goal that is not\nforbidden by the Constitution will be deemed sufficient to meet the ratio-\nnal basis test.” Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and\nPolicies 698 (4th ed. 2011).\n\f                        PERRY v.

[A]lthough the state\n    undeniably has a legitimate interest in promoting\n    “responsible procreation,” that interest cannot be\n    viewed as a valid basis for defining or limiting the\n    class of persons who may claim the protection of the\n    fundamental constitutional right to marry.\n\nIn re Marriage Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432 (Cal. 2008) (empha-\nsis added), superseded by constitutional amendment as stated\nin Strauss, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                               2.\n\n   With regard to the optimal parenting rationale, the Califor-\nnia Supreme Court stated the following about “the state’s\ninterest in fostering a favorable environment for the procre-\nation and raising of children”:\n\n    [A]lthough promoting and facilitating a stable envi-\n    ronment for the procreation and raising of children\n    is unquestionably one of the vitally important pur-\n    poses underlying the institution of marriage and the\n    constitutional right to marry, past cases make clear\n    that this right is not confined to, or restrictively\n    defined by, that purpose alone. As noted above, our\n    past cases have recognized that the right to marry is\n\f1664                         PERRY v. BROWN\n     the right to enter into a relationship that is the center\n     of the personal affections that ennoble and enrich\n     human life—a relationship that is at once the most\n     socially productive and individually fulfilling rela-\n     tionship that one can enjoy in the course of a life-\n     time. The personal enrichment afforded by the right\n     to marry may be obtained by a couple whether or not\n     they choose to have children, and the right to marry\n     never has been limited to those who plan or desire to\n     have children. . . . [T]he state constitutional right to\n     marry . . . cannot properly be defined by or limited\n     to the state’s interest in fostering a favorable envi-\n     ronment for the procreation and raising of children.\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 432 (citations and internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). Thus, the California Supreme Court\ndiscussed “the state’s interest in fostering a favorable environ-\nment for the protection and raising of children” without using\nthe “legitimate interest” and “for the purposes of the rational\nbasis equal protection standard” language used to discuss “re-\nsponsible procreation.” See id.\n\n                                     a.\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that the optimal parenting rationale cannot\nbe a legitimate governmental interest because same-sex cou-\nples in domestic partnerships have all the substantive parent-\ning rights opposite-sex couples in marriages enjoy.\nAdditionally, California family law does not give any official\npreferences to opposite-sex parents.4 Proposition 8 did not\n   4\n     For example, “[t]he rights and obligations of registered domestic part-\nners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those\nof spouses.” Cal.

In my view, while Plaintiffs may give a correct\naccounting of California law, it does not necessarily follow\nthat the optimal parenting rationale is an illegitimate govern-\nmental interest, because it contradicts existing laws on parent-\ning and the family. For example, a posited reason offered by\none lawmaking body after being rejected by another lawmak-\ning body can “provide[ ] a conceivable basis” for a measure.\nFCC v.

They argue that their evidence shows that married\nbiological parents are the optimal parenting structure.

Both sides also offer evidence to\nundermine the evidence presented by their opponents. How-\never, the standard only requires that the optimal parenting\nrationale be based on “rational speculation” about married\nbiological parents being the best for children.

BROWN                      1669\n455 F.3d at 867-68 (citations omitted).\n\n    The factual context in California is distinguishable from the\none the Eighth Circuit faced in Nebraska. Unlike the\nNebraska constitutional amendment, which prohibited the rec-\nognition of both marriages by same-sex couples and other\nsame-sex relationships, Proposition 8 left California’s existing\ndomestic partnership laws intact. In California, same-sex cou-\nples in domestic partnerships still enjoy the same substantive\nrights and benefits as opposite-sex couples in marriages.\nThus, it cannot be said that Proposition 8 “confer[s] the\ninducements of marital . . . benefits on opposite-sex couples\n. . . , but not on same-sex couples . . . .” See id. at 867. How-\never, this distinction may not be dispositive, because the\nEighth Circuit was considering both the substantive legal ben-\nefits as well as the designation of marriage.\n\n                               2.\n\n   That leaves the question of whether withdrawing from\nsame-sex couples the right to access the designation of mar-\nriage, alone, rationally relates to the responsible procreation\nand optimal parenting rationales.\n\n                               a.\n\n   Regarding the responsible procreation rationale, Plaintiffs\nargue that Proponents suggest no reason to believe prohibiting\nsame-sex couples from entering relationships designated\n“marriage” will make it more likely that opposite-sex couples\nin California will marry. Put differently, Plaintiffs argue that,\nbecause Proposition 8 does not bestow an honor on opposite-\nsex couples but instead withdraws an honor from same-sex\ncouples, the responsible procreation rationale could be cred-\nited only if it is rational to believe that opposite-sex couples\nwill be less likely to raise children in a marital family if the\nstature of marriage is also available to same-sex couples. Fur-\nther, Plaintiffs argue that Proponents’ failure to describe how\n\f1670                    PERRY v. BROWN\nProposition 8 rationally relates to the responsible procreation\nrationale indicates that the rationale lacks the required “foot-\ning in the realities of the subject addressed by the legislation.”\nHeller, 509 U.S. at 321.\n\n   In response, Proponents argue that, “[b]ecause only sexual\nrelationships between men and woman can produce children,\nsuch relationships have the potential to further—or harm—\nthis interest in a way that other types of relationships do not.”\nThus, “it follows that the commonsense distinction that our\nlaw has always drawn between opposite-sex couples, on the\none hand, and all other types of relationships—including\nsame-sex couples—on the other hand, plainly bears a rational\nrelationship to the government interest in steering procreation\ninto marriage.”\n\n   However, Proposition 8 is not a “distinction that [Califor-\nnia] law has always drawn,” because it “establishes a new\nsubstantive state constitutional rule that became effective\nonce Proposition 8 was approved by the voters.” Strauss, 207\nP.3d at 115. Also,\n\n    [n]one of the past cases discussing the right to marry\n    —and identifying this right as one of the fundamen-\n    tal elements of personal autonomy and liberty pro-\n    tected by our Constitution—contains any suggestion\n    that the constitutional right to marry is possessed\n    only by individuals who are at risk of producing\n    children accidentally, or implies that this constitu-\n    tional right is not equally important for and guaran-\n    teed to responsible individuals who can be counted\n    upon to take appropriate precautions in planning for\n    parenthood.\n\nMarriage Cases, 183 P.3d at 432. In this particular context,\nthe fact that Proposition 8 established a new rule, instead of\ncontinuing a “distinction that [California] law has always\ndrawn,” weakens Proponents’ argument that Proposition 8\n\f                        PERRY v. BROWN                     1671\n“plainly bears a rational relationship” to the responsible pro-\ncreation rationale.\n\n                              b.\n\n   Regarding the optimal parenting rationale, Plaintiffs argue\nthat, because Proposition 8 does not change California’s sub-\nstantive laws governing childraising, procreation, or the fam-\nily structure, Proposition 8 cannot be rationally related to the\noptimal parenting rationale. To channel more childrearing into\nfamilies led by married biological parents, they argue that\nProposition 8 would have had to change those laws somehow.\nRather, Proposition 8 only singles out gays and lesbians, as a\ngroup, as inferior.\n\n   Proponents contend that this argument subjects Proposition\n8 to heightened scrutiny review, and that the standard for\nrational basis review does not require the classification be\nsubstantially related to an important governmental interest.\nInstead, for rational basis review, the classification must only\n(1) serve some conceivable governmental interest; (2) have a\nplausible reason for the enactment; (3) remain debatable; and\n(4) not be totally arbitrary. Their argument continues that, in\nCalifornia’s unique context, Proposition 8 only deals with the\ndesignation of the term “marriage” but leaves undisturbed all\nof the other significant substantive aspects of recognized and\nprotected family relationships. Proponents’ theory only\nincreases the likelihood that children are born and raised in a\nfamily structure of biological parents by encouraging such\nparents to marry; the designation of marriage for only that\nunion would make it more likely that opposite-sex couples\nwill want to enter into marriage and then subsequently raise\ntheir own biological offspring, rather than implying that any\nother union could not be good parents. Proponents claim this\ninterest does not depend on any judgment about the relative\nparenting capabilities of opposite-sex and same-sex couples;\nit only confirms the instinctive, commonsense belief that mar-\nried biological parents provide the optimal environment for\n\f1672                         PERRY v. BROWN\nraising children. Lastly, they argue there can be no require-\nment of narrow tailoring where there would be a perfect fit\nwith the governmental interest and the law. If the state denied\nsame-sex couples significant benefits under the law, the law\nwould be more likely to fail equal protection by denying\nimportant government rights, thus increasing the burden of\nthe test.\n\n                                     3.\n\n   “[C]ourts are compelled under rational-basis review to\naccept a legislature’s generalizations even when there is an\nimperfect fit between means and ends.” Heller, 509 U.S. at\n321. Here, the people of California might have believed that\nwithdrawing from same-sex couples the right to access the\ndesignation of marriage would, arguably, further the interests\nin promoting responsible procreation and optimal parenting.\n“The assumptions underlying these rationales may be errone-\nous, but the very fact that they are ‘arguable’ is sufficient, on\nrational-basis review, to ‘immuniz[e]’ the congressional\nchoice from constitutional challenge.” Beach Commc’ns, 508\nU.S. at 320 (alteration in original).\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that Proposition 8 could only advance the\noffered rationales through encouraging opposite-sex couples\nto marry, who otherwise would not marry because they disap-\nprove of same-sex couples having the right of access to the\ndesignation of marriage and the stature that comes with the\ndesignation. Therefore, Proposition 8 impermissibly gives\neffect to those “private biases.” See Palmore v.

Again, in determining whether there is a rational rela-\ntionship, one must bear in mind that rational basis review “is\nthe most relaxed and tolerant form of judicial scrutiny under\nthe Equal Protection Clause.” Dallas, 490 U.S. at 26.

BROWN\n    almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be\n    placed on different sides of the line, and the fact that\n    the line might have been drawn differently at some\n    points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial,\n    consideration.\n\nBeach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 315-16 (alteration, citations,\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the judiciary\nfaces a conspicuous limit on our judicial role in applying\nequal protection to legislative enactments, because\n\n    [t]he Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment\n    permits States a wide scope of discretion in enacting\n    laws which affect some groups of citizens differently\n    than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended\n    only if classification rests on grounds wholly irrele-\n    vant to the achievement of the State’s objective.\n    State legislatures are presumed to have acted within\n    their constitutional power despite the fact that, in\n    practice, their laws result in some inequality. A stat-\n    utory discrimination will not be set aside if any state\n    of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\n\nMcGowan v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106249\"><a href=\"/opinion/106249/mcgowan-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425-26 (1961). A law\nmust be upheld unless the government’s judgment “is ‘clearly\nwrong, a display of arbitrary power, [or] not an exercise of\njudgment.’ ” Mathews v. DeCastro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109569\"><a href=\"/opinion/109569/mathews-v-de-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185 (1976).\n\n   Applying rational basis review in these circumstances also\nrequires such restraint. As the Eighth Circuit said, in Citizens\nfor Equal Protection, 455 F.3d at 870:\n\n    In the nearly one hundred and fifty years since the\n    Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, to our knowl-\n    edge no Justice of the Supreme Court has suggested\n    that a state statute or constitutional provision codify-\n    ing the traditional definition of marriage violates the\n    Equal Protection Clause or any other provision of the\n\f                   PERRY v. BROWN                        1675\nUnited States Constitution. Indeed, in Baker v. Nel-\nson, . . . when faced with a Fourteenth Amendment\nchallenge to a decision by the Supreme Court of\nMinnesota denying a marriage license to a same-sex\ncouple, the United States Supreme Court dismissed\n“for want of a substantial federal question.” There is\ngood reason for this restraint.\n\f</pre>",
