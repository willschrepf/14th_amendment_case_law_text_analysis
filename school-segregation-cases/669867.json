Leslie (argued), Senior Deputy Attorney General,\nand Catherine Cortez Masto, Attorney General, Carson City,\nNevada, for Defendants-Appellees.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge:\n\n    While incarcerated in Ely State Prison in Ely, Nevada,\nChristopher Jones wrote a letter to his fellow inmates, calling\non them to work together in support of his class action\nlawsuit against prison administrators. Later, prison officials\ndiscovered the letter in Jones’ cell and disciplined him for\nviolating a prison regulation that prohibited encouraging\ndisruption.\n\n    Jones filed suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nWarden E.K. McDaniel, Corrections Officer Mark Drain, and\nNevada Department of Corrections (“NDOC”) Director\nJackie Crawford (collectively, “defendants”), alleging\nviolations of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The\ndistrict court granted Jones summary judgment on the due\nprocess claim, but granted defendants summary judgment as\nto the First Amendment claims. Following a jury trial on\ndamages in which Jones was awarded both nominal and\npunitive damages, the parties entered into a settlement\nagreement, according to which Jones received $11,000 plus\ncosts and attorney’s fees, as well as expungement of the\nrecord of the violation, “in full satisfaction of the judgment\nentered herein.” Jones then filed this appeal seeking review\nof the district court’s adverse partial summary judgment order\nregarding his First Amendment claims.\n\f4                    JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\n    The question in this case is whether Jones’ appeal may go\nforward or whether it was rendered moot by the parties’\nsettlement agreement. We hold the latter and dismiss the\nappeal.\n\n                        I. Background\n\nA. The Letter\n\n    In September 1999, Jones drafted a letter to his fellow\ninmates, calling on them to “work togather [sic] and try and\ntie this system in knots, by using the legal system and the\nadministrative grievence [sic] process to open the door for [a]\nclass action I am working on.” By “working together for our\ncommon good,” Jones wrote, the inmates “[would] have a\nloud voice” to “direct [their] distrust, dissatisfaction, rage and\nintelligence in one direction (at the system) instead of at each\nother.” Jones concluded by telling inmates to “read this[,]\nand if you agree[,] just write your cell [number] on the back\nand pass it to the next cell and I’ll get back to you with the\nnext step.” Jones did not circulate the letter broadly; he may,\nhowever, have shown it to a few other inmates.\n\n    In September 2000, NDOC Corrections Officer Michael\nNustad searched Jones’ cell as part of an unrelated prison-\nwide search. According to Jones, Officer Nustad was aware\nthat Jones previously had filed § 1983 actions against several\nother corrections officers. Jones states that during the search\nof his cell, he heard Officer Nustad tell another corrections\nofficer, “this is the case I was telling you about against the\nSarg, Rob and Grant. This is that assh–e.” At some point\nduring the search, Officer Nustad discovered the letter.\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                         5\n\nB. Disciplinary Proceedings\n\n    The following day, Officer Nustad wrote up charges\nagainst Jones for violating Code of Penal Discipline Section\nMJ-28, which prohibits prisoners from “[o]rganizing,\nencouraging or participating in a work stoppage or other\ndisruptive demonstration or practice.”            The charging\ndocument characterizes the letter as an “attempt to organize\nand disrupt,” citing language from the letter calling on\ninmates to “[tie] the system in knots” and “direct . . . distrust,\ndissatisfaction, rage and intelligence . . . at the system.”\n\n    Corrections Officer Mark Drain served as the Hearing\nOfficer at Jones’ subsequent disciplinary hearing on the MJ-\n28 charge. At the hearing, Officer Drain refused Jones’\nrequest for a copy of the letter to review prior to or during the\nproceedings. When Jones repeatedly asked for the letter to be\nproduced, Officer Drain removed him for “disrupting the\nhearing.” Officer Drain then determined that Jones had\nviolated MJ-28, and issued sanctions of 180 days in\ndisciplinary segregation, 90 days loss of phone privileges, and\nforfeiture of the letter.\n\n    Jones appealed Officer Drain’s determination to Warden\nMcDaniel, contending that the letter should have been\npresented at the hearing, and that it was protected under the\nFirst Amendment. Warden McDaniel upheld the finding and\nsanctions. Having exhausted his appeals within the prison\nsystem, Jones served the entirety of his disciplinary sanctions.\n\f6                    JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\nC. Jones’ § 1983 Suit\n\n    1. Partial Summary Judgment Orders\n\n    Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Jones filed an amended\ncomplaint against Officer Drain, Warden McDaniel, and\nNDOC Director Crawford. Jones asserted three causes of\naction: (1) violation of his procedural due process rights\nstemming from Officer Drain’s refusal to produce the letter\nat the disciplinary hearing; (2) violation of his First\nAmendment rights and retaliation based on the exercise of his\nright to free speech; and (3) violations of the First, Fifth, and\nFourteenth Amendments by Warden McDaniel and Crawford\nbased on their failure to supervise their subordinates. Jones\nrequested declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as\ncompensatory and punitive damages in excess of $10,000.\n\n    Magistrate Judge Robert McQuaid, Jr. issued a Report\nand Recommendation (“R&R”) on the parties’ cross-motions\nfor summary judgment recommending that the court: (1)\ngrant Jones’ request for summary judgment as to the due\nprocess claim; (2) grant defendants’ request for summary\njudgment as to the First Amendment and retaliation claims;\nand (3) grant Jones’ request for summary judgment on his\nfailure to supervise claim against Warden McDaniel, but deny\nJones’ request for the same claim as to Crawford. The district\ncourt later issued an order accepting the R&R.\n\n    2. The Trial\n\n    Upon the district court’s finding that Officer Drain and\nWarden McDaniel violated Jones’ due process rights, the\nparties “proceed[ed] to trial solely on the issue of Mr. Jones’\n\f                         JONES V . MCDANIEL                         7\n\ndamages.”1 Magistrate Judge McQuaid, the same judge who\nissued the R&R, presided over the trial. As in his amended\ncomplaint, Jones sought nominal and punitive damages,2 as\nwell as injunctive and declaratory relief. At trial, Jones\nargued that his disciplinary sanctions, particularly his\nplacement in disciplinary segregation, constituted an\nexaggerated response to the uncirculated letter, thereby\nentitling him to punitive damages.\n\n    The jury agreed and awarded Jones $2 in nominal\ndamages ($1 each for Officer Drain’s violation and Warden\nMcDaniel’s violation) and $11,000 in punitive damages.\nThat same day, the district court issued its “Judgement in a\nCivil Case,” which ordered that Jones recover $11,002 from\ndefendants.\n\n         3. The Settlement\n\n    Following the district court’s entry of judgment in this\ncase, the parties filed various post-judgment motions.\nMagistrate Judge McQuaid then held a “Status Conference”\nto resolve the post-judgment motions.3 At the conference,\ndefendants agreed to pay Jones a total of $34,825.16, which\nincluded Jones’ damages award of $11,0004 plus attorney’s\nfees and costs. Defendants also agreed to expunge the\n\n 1\n     The parties “agreed to waive Jackie Crawford’s liability.”\n\n 2\n     A pretrial ruling precluded compensatory damages.\n\n     3\n    Jones attended the meeting by telephone; his attorney attended in\nperson along with defendants’ counsel.\n\n  4\n    Jones agreed at the conference to forego the $2 in nominal damages\nawarded.\n\f8                    JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\nofficial records of Jones’ MJ-28 violation and subsequent\ndiscipline. Judge McQuaid then stated to Jones, “[i]n\nexchange for that . . . you will execute a release of all claims,\nreleasing the defendants from all claims arising out of this\nlawsuit.” Jones’ attorney responded that “since the case was\ndecided on the merits,” the term “release[]” may not be\nappropriate. Judge McQuaid agreed, and indicated that the\nagreement instead would be designated a “satisfaction of\njudgment,” meaning that “the defendants paid the judgment\nand it’s satisfied.” At that point, Judge McQuaid asked\nJones, “[n]ow, you agree to that settlement, Mr. Jones?” to\nwhich Jones responded, “[y]es, I do, Your Honor.” The\nparties then stipulated to withdraw all post-trial motions, and\nJudge McQuaid concluded: “[t]hen it’s done. It’s all\ndone. . . . Just a Satisfaction of Judgment, that’s the last\ndocument in the file and then the file will be closed.”\n\n     The parties thereupon executed an “Accord and\nSatisfaction,” providing that the defendants agreed to pay\nJones a total of $11,800 plus $23,025.16 in attorney’s fees,\nand to remove all record of the disciplinary charge. The\ndocument then states that “Jones, by and through his attorney\n. . . hereby acknowledge[s] receipt of payment . . . in full\nsatisfaction of the judgment entered herein and the accord\nregarding post judgment disputes raised by the parties.”\n\n    4. The Appeal\n\n    Two days after executing the Accord and Satisfaction,\nJones filed a pro se Notice of Appeal of the district court’s\norder adopting the R&R. Defendants moved to dismiss the\nappeal on the grounds that the Accord and Satisfaction\nresolved all of Jones’ claims against them. Alternatively,\ndefendants’ motion sought an indicative ruling from the\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                       9\n\ndistrict court pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n12.1 as to the scope of the Accord and Satisfaction. A\nmotions panel of this court denied the motion “without\nprejudice to refiling if the district court issues an indicative\nruling.”\n\n    Defendants thereupon filed a “Motion for Indicative\nRuling” in the district court, seeking the court’s views as to\nthe scope of the Accord and Satisfaction. The district court\ndenied the motion because “there [were] not any outstanding\nmotions pending before [that] court on which to rule,” but\nstated that, insofar as\n\n       the Court of Appeals was seeking this court’s\n       opinion as to the scope of the settlement\n       reached on June 29, 2010, it was [this court’s]\n       opinion that the case was fully and finally\n       settled on that date with no issues remaining\n       and that the case would be closed following\n       the filing of the Satisfaction of Judgment.\n\n    Based on the district court’s order, defendants renewed\ntheir motion to dismiss the appeal. We denied the renewed\nmotion, and subsequently ordered the appointment of pro\nbono counsel to represent Jones on appeal.\n\n                       II. Discussion\n\nA. Settlement & Mootness\n\n    We begin with some general observations regarding the\neffect of a prior settlement on a case pending on appeal.\n“Generally, when a party settles all of his personal claims\nbefore appeal, an appeals court must dismiss the appeal as\n\f10                   JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\nmoot.” Smith v. T-Mobile USA Inc., 570 F.3d 1119, 1122\n(9th Cir. 2009). That is because there is no “live case or\ncontroversy” where “the parties’ settlement agreement has\nresolved all facets of their dispute.” Gator.com Corp. v. L.L.\nBean, Inc., 398 F.3d 1125, 1131–32 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc).\nThus, we have held, where a plaintiff “enter[s] into a\nsettlement agreement in which she agree[s] to relinquish ‘any\nclaims,’” against a defendant, a subsequent appeal of such a\nclaim is moot. Sanford v. MemberWorks, Inc., 625 F.3d 550,\n556–57 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\n    The question in this case, then, is whether the parties’\nAccord and Satisfaction “resolved all facets of their dispute,”\nincluding Jones’ First Amendment claims, thereby rendering\nthis appeal moot. Gator.com Corp., 398 F.3d at 1132; see\nalso 13B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3533.2, at 785 (3d\ned. 2008) (noting that a settlement moots only the issues the\nparties intended to settle). According to Jones, the Accord\nand Satisfaction is limited to the judgment entered on his due\nprocess claim, and “has nothing to do with the First\nAmendment claim[s].” Defendants disagree, urging that the\nparties intended “to settle the entire litigation” at the June 29,\n2010 Status Conference.\n\n     As a general matter, “‘[t]he construction and enforcement\nof settlement agreements are governed by principles of local\nlaw.’” O’Neil v. Bunge Corp., 365 F.3d 820, 822 (9th Cir.\n2004) (quoting United Commercial Ins. Serv., Inc. v.\nPaymaster Corp., 962 F.2d 853, 856 (9th Cir. 1992)). That\nis true “even where a federal cause of action is settled or\nreleased.” Botefur v. City of Eagle Point, 7 F.3d 152, 156\n(9th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\n\f                    JONES V . MCDANIEL                      11\n\n    Under Nevada law, “a settlement agreement[’s]\nconstruction and enforcement are governed by principles of\ncontract law.” May v. Anderson, 119 P.3d 1254, 1257 (Nev.\n2005). The “ultimate goal is to effectuate the contracting\nparties’ intent.” In re Amerco Derivative Litig., 252 P.3d\n681, 693 (Nev. 2011). Although any analysis of a\nsettlement’s terms starts with the language of the agreement,\n“when that intent is not clearly expressed in the contractual\nlanguage, [courts] may also consider the circumstances\nsurrounding the agreement.” Id.\n\nB. The Accord & Satisfaction\n\n    We turn now to the settlement agreement at issue in this\ncase. Pursuant to the Accord and Satisfaction, the parties\nagreed to withdraw all post-trial motions. Defendants also\nagreed to pay Jones $11,000 in punitive damages, plus costs\nand attorney’s fees, and to expunge all records of the\ndisciplinary charge. For his part, Jones gave up the nominal\ndamages and acknowledged receipt of the agreed-upon\npayment “in full satisfaction of the judgment entered herein.”\n\n    There is only one judgment to which the statement “the\njudgment entered herein” could possibly refer: the “Judgment\nin a Civil Action” entered by the district court on March 31,\n2010. On its face, that judgment makes no mention of Jones’\nindividual causes of action. It simply states that “[t]he court\nhas ordered that . . . Jones[] recover from [Officer Drain]\n$1.00 in nominal damages, and $4,000.00 in punitive\ndamages, and that [Jones] recover from [Warden McDaniel]\n$1.00 in nominal damages, and $7,000.00 in punitive\ndamages.”\n\f12                   JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\n    Jones maintains that because the “Judgement in a Civil\nAction” does not mention his First Amendment claims, it\ndoes not encompass the district court’s earlier partial\nsummary judgment order as to those claims. Thus, he argues,\nthe Accord and Satisfaction also does not cover those claims.\n\n   Not so. Orders granting partial summary judgment “are\nnot final appealable orders.” Dannenberg v. Software\nToolworks Inc., 16 F.3d 1073, 1074 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “As a result, parties ordinarily\nmust obtain Rule 54(b) certification in order to appeal partial\nsummary judgments.” Id.; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Absent\nsuch certification, “[a] ruling on a motion for partial summary\njudgment merges with the final judgment.” Adkins v.\nMireles, 526 F.3d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 2008); see also 15B\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3914.28 (2d ed. 1991 &\n2008 Supp.).\n\n    Jones did not seek Rule 54(b) certification of the district\ncourt’s order granting defendants summary judgment on the\nFirst Amendment claims. Accordingly, that order merged\nwith the district court’s final judgment, i.e., the “Judgment in\na Civil Case.” Ordinarily, a partial summary judgment order\nthat has merged with the final judgment “is reviewable on\nappeal from the final judgment.” Adkins, 526 F.3d at 538.\nHere, however, the parties executed an agreement “in full\nsatisfaction” of the final judgment. By its plain terms, then,\nthe Accord and Satisfaction encompasses the district court’s\nprior summary judgment ruling on Jones’ First Amendment\nclaims.\n\n    Moreover, at no point did Jones attempt to reserve his\nright to appeal or otherwise exclude his First Amendment\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                       13\n\nclaims from the agreement. We can find no authority (and\nJones cites none) supporting Jones’ claim that his right to\nappeal the First Amendment claims was automatically\npreserved. To the contrary, we have held in related contexts\nthat “[i]n general, a party cannot appeal a judgment entered\nwith its consent” unless it “specifically preserves its right to\nappeal.” Slaven v. Am. Trading Transp. Co., 146 F.3d 1066,\n1070 (9th Cir. 1998). In executing the Accord and\nSatisfaction, Jones essentially consented to the “full\nsatisfaction of the judgment entered herein,” which, as noted,\nincluded the court’s prior ruling on Jones’ First Amendment\nclaims.\n\n     The circumstances surrounding the execution of the\nAccord and Satisfaction confirm the parties’ intent to settle\nall of Jones’ claims. At the June 29, 2010 Settlement\nConference, Judge McQuaid explained to Jones that, under\nthe terms of the agreement, Jones “will execute a release of\nall claims, releasing defendants from all claims arising out of\nthis lawsuit.” At the parties’ request, Judge McQuaid\nindicated that the agreement would be designated a\n“satisfaction of judgment” instead of a “release,” meaning\nthat “the defendants paid the judgment and it’s satisfied.”\nJudge McQuaid then asked Jones, “[n]ow, you agree to that\nsettlement, Mr. Jones?” to which Jones responded, “[y]es, I\ndo, Your Honor.”\n\n    Although Judge McQuaid’s statement that Jones would\nrelease “all [of the] claims arising out of this lawsuit” was not\nmemorialized in the Accord and Satisfaction, that does not\nmean Jones may escape the legal consequences of his assent.\nUnder Nevada law, a contract may be formed “when the\nparties have agreed to the material terms, even though the\ncontract’s exact language is not finalized until later.” May,\n\f14                   JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\n121 Nev. at 672. What matters, therefore, is that parties\nintended to resolve the entire dispute at the settlement\nconference, and so indicated orally. Nothing in the written\ndocument is inconsistent with that intent.\n\n    In light of that intent, Jones’ reliance on the “usual rule in\nthe federal courts . . . that payment of a judgment does not\nforeclose an appeal,” Milicevic v. Fletcher Jones Imports,\nLtd., 402 F.3d 912 (9th Cir. 2005), is misplaced. See also\nStanton Rd. Assocs. v. Lohrey Enters., 984 F.2d 1015, 1020\n(9th Cir. 1993) (“The fact that payments have been made in\nsatisfaction of a money judgment does not foreclose an\nappeal.”). As we noted in Milicevic, that general rule does\nnot apply where, as here, “there is some contemporaneous\nagreement not to appeal, implicit in a compromise of the\nclaim after judgment.” Milicevic, 402 F.3d at 915. The\nNevada Supreme Court similarly recognizes that satisfaction\nof a judgment “waives the right to appeal or renders the\nmatter moot when the payment is intended to compromise or\nsettle the matter.” Wheeler Springs Plaza, LLC v. Beemon,\n119 Nev. 260, 265 (2003). That plainly is the case here.\n\n     Finally, it makes sense that Jones would have agreed to\nresolve the entire dispute with defendants, so as to preclude\nan appeal by the defendants. Jones initially sought in his\namended complaint “damages in excess of $10,000.” Under\nthe terms of the Accord and Satisfaction, that is precisely\nwhat he received. That $11,000 punitive damages award,\nmoreover, represented a penalty against defendants for taking\ndisciplinary action against Jones following discovery of the\nletter—namely, placing him in disciplinary segregation.\nAlthough that damages award would not, by itself, preclude\nJones from seeking nominal damages for the alleged First\nAmendment violations, it is unlikely that Jones would be\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                       15\n\nentitled to additional damages for the disciplinary sanctions.\nSee, e.g., Elyousef v. O’Reilly & Ferrario, LLC, 245 P.3d\n547, 549 (Nev. 2010) (holding that “[a] plaintiff may not\nrecover damages twice for the same injury simply because he\nor she has two legal theories” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n     Further, defendants had already returned the letter to\nJones, and they agreed in the Accord and Satisfaction to\nremove all records pertaining to the MJ-28 disciplinary\ncharges. In fact, much of the discussion at the June 2010\nStatus Conference centered on whether and how defendants\nwould expunge Jones’ disciplinary record. The expungement\nwas not part of the jury award; rather, it was relief bargained\nfor at the Status Conference. By agreeing to relinquish his\nremaining claims against defendants in exchange for that\nbenefit, Jones obtained a remedy responsive to his First\nAmendment concerns and not obtained in the course of\nlitigating the due process issue. Having received that relief,\nit is difficult to see what further injunctive relief Jones could\nhave obtained were he permitted to proceed with his First\nAmendment claims.\n\n    In short, given that Jones had obtained $11,000 in\ndamages, return of the letter, and expungement of the\nviolation and disciplinary sanctions, it is unsurprising that he\nagreed to release his remaining claims against defendants and\ndid not seek to exclude his First Amendment claims from the\nagreement.\n\n    Finally, we note that there is little reason to remand\nJones’ case to the district court for a determination as to the\nscope of the settlement agreement. The district court has\nalready weighed in on the matter, stating its “opinion that the\n\f16                  JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\ncase was fully and finally settled on [June 29, 2010] with no\nissues remaining.” We agree and, accordingly, dismiss\nJones’ appeal as moot.

Leslie (argued), Senior Deputy Attorney General,\nand Catherine Cortez Masto, Attorney General, Carson City,\nNevada, for Defendants-Appellees.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge:\n\n    While incarcerated in Ely State Prison in Ely, Nevada,\nChristopher Jones wrote a letter to his fellow inmates, calling\non them to work together in support of his class action\nlawsuit against prison administrators. Later, prison officials\ndiscovered the letter in Jones’ cell and disciplined him for\nviolating a prison regulation that prohibited encouraging\ndisruption.\n\n    Jones filed suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nWarden E.K. McDaniel, Corrections Officer Mark Drain, and\nNevada Department of Corrections (“NDOC”) Director\nJackie Crawford (collectively, “defendants”), alleging\nviolations of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The\ndistrict court granted Jones summary judgment on the due\nprocess claim, but granted defendants summary judgment as\nto the First Amendment claims. Following a jury trial on\ndamages in which Jones was awarded both nominal and\npunitive damages, the parties entered into a settlement\nagreement, according to which Jones received $11,000 plus\ncosts and attorney’s fees, as well as expungement of the\nrecord of the violation, “in full satisfaction of the judgment\nentered herein.” Jones then filed this appeal seeking review\nof the district court’s adverse partial summary judgment order\nregarding his First Amendment claims.\n\f4                    JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\n    The question in this case is whether Jones’ appeal may go\nforward or whether it was rendered moot by the parties’\nsettlement agreement. We hold the latter and dismiss the\nappeal.\n\n                        I. Background\n\nA. The Letter\n\n    In September 1999, Jones drafted a letter to his fellow\ninmates, calling on them to “work togather [sic] and try and\ntie this system in knots, by using the legal system and the\nadministrative grievence [sic] process to open the door for [a]\nclass action I am working on.” By “working together for our\ncommon good,” Jones wrote, the inmates “[would] have a\nloud voice” to “direct [their] distrust, dissatisfaction, rage and\nintelligence in one direction (at the system) instead of at each\nother.” Jones concluded by telling inmates to “read this[,]\nand if you agree[,] just write your cell [number] on the back\nand pass it to the next cell and I’ll get back to you with the\nnext step.” Jones did not circulate the letter broadly; he may,\nhowever, have shown it to a few other inmates.\n\n    In September 2000, NDOC Corrections Officer Michael\nNustad searched Jones’ cell as part of an unrelated prison-\nwide search. According to Jones, Officer Nustad was aware\nthat Jones previously had filed § 1983 actions against several\nother corrections officers. Jones states that during the search\nof his cell, he heard Officer Nustad tell another corrections\nofficer, “this is the case I was telling you about against the\nSarg, Rob and Grant. This is that assh–e.” At some point\nduring the search, Officer Nustad discovered the letter.\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                         5\n\nB. Disciplinary Proceedings\n\n    The following day, Officer Nustad wrote up charges\nagainst Jones for violating Code of Penal Discipline Section\nMJ-28, which prohibits prisoners from “[o]rganizing,\nencouraging or participating in a work stoppage or other\ndisruptive demonstration or practice.”            The charging\ndocument characterizes the letter as an “attempt to organize\nand disrupt,” citing language from the letter calling on\ninmates to “[tie] the system in knots” and “direct . . . distrust,\ndissatisfaction, rage and intelligence . . . at the system.”\n\n    Corrections Officer Mark Drain served as the Hearing\nOfficer at Jones’ subsequent disciplinary hearing on the MJ-\n28 charge. At the hearing, Officer Drain refused Jones’\nrequest for a copy of the letter to review prior to or during the\nproceedings. When Jones repeatedly asked for the letter to be\nproduced, Officer Drain removed him for “disrupting the\nhearing.” Officer Drain then determined that Jones had\nviolated MJ-28, and issued sanctions of 180 days in\ndisciplinary segregation, 90 days loss of phone privileges, and\nforfeiture of the letter.\n\n    Jones appealed Officer Drain’s determination to Warden\nMcDaniel, contending that the letter should have been\npresented at the hearing, and that it was protected under the\nFirst Amendment. Warden McDaniel upheld the finding and\nsanctions. Having exhausted his appeals within the prison\nsystem, Jones served the entirety of his disciplinary sanctions.\n\f6                    JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\nC. Jones’ § 1983 Suit\n\n    1. Partial Summary Judgment Orders\n\n    Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Jones filed an amended\ncomplaint against Officer Drain, Warden McDaniel, and\nNDOC Director Crawford. Jones asserted three causes of\naction: (1) violation of his procedural due process rights\nstemming from Officer Drain’s refusal to produce the letter\nat the disciplinary hearing; (2) violation of his First\nAmendment rights and retaliation based on the exercise of his\nright to free speech; and (3) violations of the First, Fifth, and\nFourteenth Amendments by Warden McDaniel and Crawford\nbased on their failure to supervise their subordinates. Jones\nrequested declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as\ncompensatory and punitive damages in excess of $10,000.\n\n    Magistrate Judge Robert McQuaid, Jr. issued a Report\nand Recommendation (“R&R”) on the parties’ cross-motions\nfor summary judgment recommending that the court: (1)\ngrant Jones’ request for summary judgment as to the due\nprocess claim; (2) grant defendants’ request for summary\njudgment as to the First Amendment and retaliation claims;\nand (3) grant Jones’ request for summary judgment on his\nfailure to supervise claim against Warden McDaniel, but deny\nJones’ request for the same claim as to Crawford. The district\ncourt later issued an order accepting the R&R.\n\n    2. The Trial\n\n    Upon the district court’s finding that Officer Drain and\nWarden McDaniel violated Jones’ due process rights, the\nparties “proceed[ed] to trial solely on the issue of Mr. Jones’\n\f                         JONES V . MCDANIEL                         7\n\ndamages.”1 Magistrate Judge McQuaid, the same judge who\nissued the R&R, presided over the trial. As in his amended\ncomplaint, Jones sought nominal and punitive damages,2 as\nwell as injunctive and declaratory relief. At trial, Jones\nargued that his disciplinary sanctions, particularly his\nplacement in disciplinary segregation, constituted an\nexaggerated response to the uncirculated letter, thereby\nentitling him to punitive damages.\n\n    The jury agreed and awarded Jones $2 in nominal\ndamages ($1 each for Officer Drain’s violation and Warden\nMcDaniel’s violation) and $11,000 in punitive damages.\nThat same day, the district court issued its “Judgement in a\nCivil Case,” which ordered that Jones recover $11,002 from\ndefendants.\n\n         3. The Settlement\n\n    Following the district court’s entry of judgment in this\ncase, the parties filed various post-judgment motions.\nMagistrate Judge McQuaid then held a “Status Conference”\nto resolve the post-judgment motions.3 At the conference,\ndefendants agreed to pay Jones a total of $34,825.16, which\nincluded Jones’ damages award of $11,0004 plus attorney’s\nfees and costs. Defendants also agreed to expunge the\n\n 1\n     The parties “agreed to waive Jackie Crawford’s liability.”\n\n 2\n     A pretrial ruling precluded compensatory damages.\n\n     3\n    Jones attended the meeting by telephone; his attorney attended in\nperson along with defendants’ counsel.\n\n  4\n    Jones agreed at the conference to forego the $2 in nominal damages\nawarded.\n\f8                    JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\nofficial records of Jones’ MJ-28 violation and subsequent\ndiscipline. Judge McQuaid then stated to Jones, “[i]n\nexchange for that . . . you will execute a release of all claims,\nreleasing the defendants from all claims arising out of this\nlawsuit.” Jones’ attorney responded that “since the case was\ndecided on the merits,” the term “release[]” may not be\nappropriate. Judge McQuaid agreed, and indicated that the\nagreement instead would be designated a “satisfaction of\njudgment,” meaning that “the defendants paid the judgment\nand it’s satisfied.” At that point, Judge McQuaid asked\nJones, “[n]ow, you agree to that settlement, Mr. Jones?” to\nwhich Jones responded, “[y]es, I do, Your Honor.” The\nparties then stipulated to withdraw all post-trial motions, and\nJudge McQuaid concluded: “[t]hen it’s done. It’s all\ndone. . . . Just a Satisfaction of Judgment, that’s the last\ndocument in the file and then the file will be closed.”\n\n     The parties thereupon executed an “Accord and\nSatisfaction,” providing that the defendants agreed to pay\nJones a total of $11,800 plus $23,025.16 in attorney’s fees,\nand to remove all record of the disciplinary charge. The\ndocument then states that “Jones, by and through his attorney\n. . . hereby acknowledge[s] receipt of payment . . . in full\nsatisfaction of the judgment entered herein and the accord\nregarding post judgment disputes raised by the parties.”\n\n    4. The Appeal\n\n    Two days after executing the Accord and Satisfaction,\nJones filed a pro se Notice of Appeal of the district court’s\norder adopting the R&R. Defendants moved to dismiss the\nappeal on the grounds that the Accord and Satisfaction\nresolved all of Jones’ claims against them. Alternatively,\ndefendants’ motion sought an indicative ruling from the\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                       9\n\ndistrict court pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n12.1 as to the scope of the Accord and Satisfaction. A\nmotions panel of this court denied the motion “without\nprejudice to refiling if the district court issues an indicative\nruling.”\n\n    Defendants thereupon filed a “Motion for Indicative\nRuling” in the district court, seeking the court’s views as to\nthe scope of the Accord and Satisfaction. The district court\ndenied the motion because “there [were] not any outstanding\nmotions pending before [that] court on which to rule,” but\nstated that, insofar as\n\n       the Court of Appeals was seeking this court’s\n       opinion as to the scope of the settlement\n       reached on June 29, 2010, it was [this court’s]\n       opinion that the case was fully and finally\n       settled on that date with no issues remaining\n       and that the case would be closed following\n       the filing of the Satisfaction of Judgment.\n\n    Based on the district court’s order, defendants renewed\ntheir motion to dismiss the appeal. We denied the renewed\nmotion, and subsequently ordered the appointment of pro\nbono counsel to represent Jones on appeal.\n\n                       II. Discussion\n\nA. Settlement & Mootness\n\n    We begin with some general observations regarding the\neffect of a prior settlement on a case pending on appeal.\n“Generally, when a party settles all of his personal claims\nbefore appeal, an appeals court must dismiss the appeal as\n\f10                   JONES V .

Gator.com Corp., 398 F.3d at 1132; see\nalso 13B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3533.2, at 785 (3d\ned. 2008) (noting that a settlement moots only the issues the\nparties intended to settle). According to Jones, the Accord\nand Satisfaction is limited to the judgment entered on his due\nprocess claim, and “has nothing to do with the First\nAmendment claim[s].” Defendants disagree, urging that the\nparties intended “to settle the entire litigation” at the June 29,\n2010 Status Conference.\n\n     As a general matter, “‘[t]he construction and enforcement\nof settlement agreements are governed by principles of local\nlaw.’” O’Neil v.

Although any analysis of a\nsettlement’s terms starts with the language of the agreement,\n“when that intent is not clearly expressed in the contractual\nlanguage, [courts] may also consider the circumstances\nsurrounding the agreement.” Id.\n\nB. The Accord & Satisfaction\n\n    We turn now to the settlement agreement at issue in this\ncase. Pursuant to the Accord and Satisfaction, the parties\nagreed to withdraw all post-trial motions. Defendants also\nagreed to pay Jones $11,000 in punitive damages, plus costs\nand attorney’s fees, and to expunge all records of the\ndisciplinary charge. For his part, Jones gave up the nominal\ndamages and acknowledged receipt of the agreed-upon\npayment “in full satisfaction of the judgment entered herein.”\n\n    There is only one judgment to which the statement “the\njudgment entered herein” could possibly refer: the “Judgment\nin a Civil Action” entered by the district court on March 31,\n2010. On its face, that judgment makes no mention of Jones’\nindividual causes of action. It simply states that “[t]he court\nhas ordered that . . . Jones[] recover from [Officer Drain]\n$1.00 in nominal damages, and $4,000.00 in punitive\ndamages, and that [Jones] recover from [Warden McDaniel]\n$1.00 in nominal damages, and $7,000.00 in punitive\ndamages.”\n\f12                   JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\n    Jones maintains that because the “Judgement in a Civil\nAction” does not mention his First Amendment claims, it\ndoes not encompass the district court’s earlier partial\nsummary judgment order as to those claims. Thus, he argues,\nthe Accord and Satisfaction also does not cover those claims.\n\n   Not so. Orders granting partial summary judgment “are\nnot final appealable orders.” Dannenberg v. Software\nToolworks Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663162\"><a href=\"/opinion/663162/richard-b-dannenberg-mindy-blitz-kenneth-homer-fleisher-steven-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1074 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “As a result, parties ordinarily\nmust obtain Rule 54(b) certification in order to appeal partial\nsummary judgments.” Id.; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Absent\nsuch certification, “[a] ruling on a motion for partial summary\njudgment merges with the final judgment.” Adkins v.\nMireles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1190214\"><a href=\"/opinion/1190214/adkins-v-mireles/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (9th Cir. 2008); see also 15B\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3914.28 (2d ed. 1991 &\n2008 Supp.).\n\n    Jones did not seek Rule 54(b) certification of the district\ncourt’s order granting defendants summary judgment on the\nFirst Amendment claims. Accordingly, that order merged\nwith the district court’s final judgment, i.e., the “Judgment in\na Civil Case.” Ordinarily, a partial summary judgment order\nthat has merged with the final judgment “is reviewable on\nappeal from the final judgment.” Adkins, 526 F.3d at 538.\nHere, however, the parties executed an agreement “in full\nsatisfaction” of the final judgment. By its plain terms, then,\nthe Accord and Satisfaction encompasses the district court’s\nprior summary judgment ruling on Jones’ First Amendment\nclaims.\n\n    Moreover, at no point did Jones attempt to reserve his\nright to appeal or otherwise exclude his First Amendment\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                       13\n\nclaims from the agreement. We can find no authority (and\nJones cites none) supporting Jones’ claim that his right to\nappeal the First Amendment claims was automatically\npreserved. To the contrary, we have held in related contexts\nthat “[i]n general, a party cannot appeal a judgment entered\nwith its consent” unless it “specifically preserves its right to\nappeal.” Slaven v.

In executing the Accord and\nSatisfaction, Jones essentially consented to the “full\nsatisfaction of the judgment entered herein,” which, as noted,\nincluded the court’s prior ruling on Jones’ First Amendment\nclaims.\n\n     The circumstances surrounding the execution of the\nAccord and Satisfaction confirm the parties’ intent to settle\nall of Jones’ claims. At the June 29, 2010 Settlement\nConference, Judge McQuaid explained to Jones that, under\nthe terms of the agreement, Jones “will execute a release of\nall claims, releasing defendants from all claims arising out of\nthis lawsuit.” At the parties’ request, Judge McQuaid\nindicated that the agreement would be designated a\n“satisfaction of judgment” instead of a “release,” meaning\nthat “the defendants paid the judgment and it’s satisfied.”\nJudge McQuaid then asked Jones, “[n]ow, you agree to that\nsettlement, Mr. Jones?” to which Jones responded, “[y]es, I\ndo, Your Honor.”\n\n    Although Judge McQuaid’s statement that Jones would\nrelease “all [of the] claims arising out of this lawsuit” was not\nmemorialized in the Accord and Satisfaction, that does not\nmean Jones may escape the legal consequences of his assent.\nUnder Nevada law, a contract may be formed “when the\nparties have agreed to the material terms, even though the\ncontract’s exact language is not finalized until later.” May,\n\f14                   JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\n121 Nev. at 672. What matters, therefore, is that parties\nintended to resolve the entire dispute at the settlement\nconference, and so indicated orally. Nothing in the written\ndocument is inconsistent with that intent.\n\n    In light of that intent, Jones’ reliance on the “usual rule in\nthe federal courts . . . that payment of a judgment does not\nforeclose an appeal,” Milicevic v. Fletcher Jones Imports,\nLtd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789735\"><a href=\"/opinion/789735/marina-milicevic-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-fletcher-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2005), is misplaced. See also\nStanton Rd. Assocs. v.

As we noted in Milicevic, that general rule does\nnot apply where, as here, “there is some contemporaneous\nagreement not to appeal, implicit in a compromise of the\nclaim after judgment.” Milicevic, 402 F.3d at 915. The\nNevada Supreme Court similarly recognizes that satisfaction\nof a judgment “waives the right to appeal or renders the\nmatter moot when the payment is intended to compromise or\nsettle the matter.” Wheeler Springs Plaza, LLC v. Beemon,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Nev.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265 (2003). That plainly is the case here.\n\n     Finally, it makes sense that Jones would have agreed to\nresolve the entire dispute with defendants, so as to preclude\nan appeal by the defendants. Jones initially sought in his\namended complaint “damages in excess of $10,000.” Under\nthe terms of the Accord and Satisfaction, that is precisely\nwhat he received. That $11,000 punitive damages award,\nmoreover, represented a penalty against defendants for taking\ndisciplinary action against Jones following discovery of the\nletter—namely, placing him in disciplinary segregation.\nAlthough that damages award would not, by itself, preclude\nJones from seeking nominal damages for the alleged First\nAmendment violations, it is unlikely that Jones would be\n\f                     JONES V . MCDANIEL                       15\n\nentitled to additional damages for the disciplinary sanctions.\nSee, e.g., Elyousef v. O’Reilly & Ferrario, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369327\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369327/elyousef-v-oreilly-ferrario-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (Nev. 2010) (holding that “[a] plaintiff may not\nrecover damages twice for the same injury simply because he\nor she has two legal theories” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n     Further, defendants had already returned the letter to\nJones, and they agreed in the Accord and Satisfaction to\nremove all records pertaining to the MJ-28 disciplinary\ncharges. In fact, much of the discussion at the June 2010\nStatus Conference centered on whether and how defendants\nwould expunge Jones’ disciplinary record. The expungement\nwas not part of the jury award; rather, it was relief bargained\nfor at the Status Conference. By agreeing to relinquish his\nremaining claims against defendants in exchange for that\nbenefit, Jones obtained a remedy responsive to his First\nAmendment concerns and not obtained in the course of\nlitigating the due process issue. Having received that relief,\nit is difficult to see what further injunctive relief Jones could\nhave obtained were he permitted to proceed with his First\nAmendment claims.\n\n    In short, given that Jones had obtained $11,000 in\ndamages, return of the letter, and expungement of the\nviolation and disciplinary sanctions, it is unsurprising that he\nagreed to release his remaining claims against defendants and\ndid not seek to exclude his First Amendment claims from the\nagreement.\n\n    Finally, we note that there is little reason to remand\nJones’ case to the district court for a determination as to the\nscope of the settlement agreement. The district court has\nalready weighed in on the matter, stating its “opinion that the\n\f16                  JONES V . MCDANIEL\n\ncase was fully and finally settled on [June 29, 2010] with no\nissues remaining.” We agree and, accordingly, dismiss\nJones’ appeal as moot.
