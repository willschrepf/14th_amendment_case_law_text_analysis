No. 13-5084\n                                            (D.C. No. 4:12-CR-00050-JHP-1)\nVERNON JAMES HILL, a/k/a V,                           (N.D. Okla.)\n\n         Defendant – Appellant.\n\n\n                           ORDER AND JUDGMENT \n\n\nBefore HARTZ, PHILLIPS, and McHUGH, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Vernon Hill 1 was indicted, tried, and convicted of conspiring to rob and\n\nrobbing banks, credit unions, and pharmacies in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Vernon\n\nappeals and argues that the district court erred by: (1) not concluding that his\n\nindictment was constitutionally defective; (2) not severing his charges; (3) not\n\n\n\n     \n     This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines\nof law of the case, claim preclusion, and issue preclusion. It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.\n     1\n     Throughout this opinion, we will refer to Vernon Hill, Dejuan Hill, Stanley\nHill, Deandre Hopkins, and Kenneth Hopkins by their first names because there\nwere other coconspirators indicted with the same last names.\n\fsevering his trial from his codefendants’ trials; 2 (4) not concluding there was a\n\nfatal variance between the charged conspiracy and the individual conspiracies\n\nunderlying separate robberies; (5) admitting evidence of the robberies charged\n\nagainst his codefendants as well as evidence of the uncharged CVS Pharmacy\n\nrobbery; (6) admitting gang-affiliation evidence; (7) admitting gang-certification\n\nrecords; (8) admitting the underlying hearsay statements contained within the\n\ngang-certification records; (9) admitting cell phone tower records; (10) admitting\n\nlay testimony from police officers about cell phone records; and (11) admitting an\n\neyewitness identification in violation of due process. Vernon also argues that\n\ncumulative error requires that we vacate his conviction.\n\n   Exercising jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(1) and 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we\n\naffirm Vernon’s convictions for the reasons set forth below.\n\n\n                  I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n   While investigating a series of robberies in Tulsa, the local police began to\n\nsuspect that the robberies were connected. The police developed a list of\n\nsuspects, which included Vernon. Other suspects included Dontayne Tiger,\n\n\n\n\n   2\n    Of the eight men charged with the conspiracy, just three—Vernon, Dejuan,\nand Deandre—were tried together, the remaining five having pleaded guilty\nbefore trial.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fDeandre Hopkins, 3 James Miller, Christopher Lewis, Marquis Devers, Duncan\n\nHerron, and Kenneth Hopkins. Initially, police did not suspect Dejuan Hill, but a\n\ngrand jury ultimately indicted him as a coconspirator. 4 Officer Maxwell Ryden\n\ninterviewed Herron, who believed that police would eventually charge him and\n\nagreed to cooperate in the investigation.\n\n   This appeal involves seven robberies that took place between August 2009 to\n\nNovember 2011: (1) IBC Bank; (2) Dooley’s Pharmacy; (3) Barnes Pharmacy;\n\n(4) Metro Pharmacy and Medical Supplies (“Metro Pharmacy”); (5) CVS\n\nPharmacy; (6) Tulsa Municipal Employees Federal Credit Union (“Tulsa Credit\n\nUnion”); and (7) Arvest Bank. The indictment charged that Vernon had\n\nparticipated directly in the robberies of IBC Bank, Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest\n\nBank.\n\n   A federal grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against eight men,\n\ncharging that they had conspired to commit six of the seven robberies, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). 5 The indictment listed 26 overt acts committed\n\n\n   3\n    Deandre appeals his conviction in a related appeal. United States v. Hopkins,\nNo. 13-5072 (10th Cir. May 22, 2015) (unpublished).\n   4\n    Dejuan appeals his conviction in a related appeal. United States v. Hill, No.\n13-5074 (10th Cir. May 22, 2015).\n   5\n     The indictment named eight defendants: Vernon, Lewis, Deandre, Devers,\nTiger, Miller, Kenneth, and Dejuan.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fin furtherance of the conspiracy, as well as describing the manner and means of\n\nthe conspiracy. Vernon filed multiple pretrial motions. Everyone charged in the\n\nindictment pleaded guilty except for Vernon, Dejuan, and Deandre. At their joint\n\ntrial, the government introduced evidence as set forth below.\n\n\n                                  A. IBC Bank\n\n   In August 2009, a man wearing sunglasses but no mask robbed IBC Bank in\n\nTulsa. 6 At the counter, he spoke with the teller for a few minutes and then\n\ndemanded money. He told her that he had a gun. The robber left alone on foot.\n\n   Tulsa Police Officer John Brown investigated this robbery. Officer Brown\n\nshowed Officer Amilee Floyd a bank photograph of the robber standing at the\n\nteller window. Officer Floyd thought that the person in the photograph was\n\nVernon (Officer Floyd and Vernon had attended high school together). Officer\n\nBrown obtained a picture of Vernon, and he showed it to a few witnesses present\n\nat the robbery, but no one could identify him as the robber. Officer Brown then\n\n\n\n   6\n     Before the trial in this case, a state court jury acquitted Vernon of robbing\nIBC Bank. The federal jury in this case, however, returned a guilty verdict on\nCount Two, which charged Vernon with robbing IBC Bank. Count One listed\nVernon’s robbery of IBC Bank as an overt act done in furtherance of the\nconspiracy. But we conclude that the government introduced insufficient\nevidence to tie the IBC Bank robbery to any conspiracy. This conclusion does not\naffect Vernon’s conviction on Count Two for the actual robbery of IBC Bank.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fshowed the photograph from the robbery to the teller Vernon robbed, Ms.\n\nDeLeon, and she identified the man in the photograph as the bank robber. He then\n\nshowed her a photo array of six similar looking men, and she positively identified\n\nVernon as the bank robber.\n\n   At trial, Ms. DeLeon again identified Vernon as the robber. Two other\n\nwitnesses from the bank robbery also testified that Vernon was the bank robber.\n\nNeither of these two witnesses had been able to identify Vernon from the\n\nphotograph before the trial.\n\n\n                               B. Metro Pharmacy\n\n   This robbery occurred in August 2011. Herron testified at trial that he\n\nparticipated in the Metro Pharmacy robbery and described the involvement of\n\nVernon, Lewis, Devers, Tiger, and Deandre. Herron admitted to meeting with\n\nthese men to plan the Metro Pharmacy robbery. Later that day, they executed\n\ntheir plan. Herron walked into the pharmacy to buy some medicine, texted Devers\n\nas he was leaving, and held the door open for Vernon, Lewis, and Devers\n\n(because customers had to be buzzed into the pharmacy). Once inside, those three\n\nmen robbed the pharmacy, and two of the robbers brandished guns, with the third\n\nrobber (Vernon) carrying a bag. Herron testified that both Tiger and Deandre\n\nacted as lookouts during the robbery. After the robbery, the men, except Herron,\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fgot into a van parked outside of the pharmacy and drove away. As Tiger\n\ninstructed, Herron called 911 to report the robbery after they had left, attempting\n\nto divert the police’s attention from his involvement.\n\n   At trial, the government admitted cell phone records establishing that Devers’s\n\nphone had called the Metro Pharmacy twice before the robbery, that Devers’s\n\nphone and Herron’s phone had communicated by text message during the\n\nrobbery, and that Lewis’s phone and Vernon’s phone had contacted each other by\n\ncell phone during the robbery.\n\n\n                                  C. Arvest Bank\n\n   This robbery occurred in November 2011, and before the trial in this case, a\n\nfederal jury had already convicted Vernon of committing it. 7 We affirmed his\n\nconviction on appeal. United States v. Hill, 737 F.3d 683, 689 (10th Cir. 2013). In\n\nthe present case, the government charged Vernon with having also conspired to\n\ncommit this offense. 8\n\n\n\n   7\n     This robbery is discussed in depth in United States v. Hill, ___ F.3d ___\n(10th Cir. 2015), our decision affirming the conviction of Dejuan, who robbed\nArvest Bank with Vernon.\n   8\n    To clarify, the Supreme Court has held that a substantive crime and a\nconspiracy to commit that crime are not the same offense for double jeopardy\npurposes. United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 391–92 (1992).\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f   Two armed, masked men robbed Arvest Bank. Amidst the money the tellers\n\ngave the bank robbers were previously concealed marked $50 bait bills and a\n\nstrap of $20 bills containing a GPS tracker. When bank employees pull the bait\n\nmoney containing the GPS tracker, this alerts the security company, and the\n\nsecurity company calls the bank to check on the situation. Upon the GPS tracker’s\n\nremoval from its magnetic plate, it sent a signal to the police, alerting them of the\n\nrobbery. After the phones began to ring, Juantonio Baldwin, a bank teller, told the\n\nrobbers that the security company was calling and that they should leave. The\n\nrobbers then left the bank.\n\n   Officers immediately began receiving location updates from the tracker. The\n\ndevice was moving “pretty fast,” so they assumed that it was traveling in an\n\nautomobile. The tracker stopped moving near 1109 East Pine Street, which was\n\nnear Vernon’s known residence at 1107 East Pine Street. The officers obtained a\n\nhand-held tracker, which allowed them to pinpoint exactly where the tracking\n\ndevice was located. They confirmed that it was inside 1107 East Pine. The\n\nofficers obtained a search warrant for the house. Before they executed the search\n\nwarrant, Vernon and Stanley Hill (Vernon’s brother) emerged from the house, and\n\nthe officers arrested them. Upon executing the search warrant, the officers found\n\nmoney stolen from the bank, the GPS tracker, a Glock pistol, a hooded black\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsweatshirt, a ski mask, gloves, and dark-colored pants, all of which they believed\n\nhad been used in the robbery.\n\n\n                            D. The Larger Conspiracy\n\n   The government’s theory of the case at trial was that all eight individuals\n\nindicted had conspired, generally, to commit bank, credit union, and pharmacy\n\nrobberies in Tulsa. To prove this larger conspiracy, the government relied heavily\n\non each coconspirator’s relationship with the Hoover Crips street gang. The\n\ngovernment also highlighted the perceived similarities between the robberies. At\n\ntrial, the government introduced evidence of three robberies for which Vernon\n\nwas not charged—Dooley’s Pharmacy, Barnes Pharmacy, and Tulsa Credit Union.\n\nNo direct evidence linked Vernon to any of those robberies. The government also\n\nintroduced evidence of a robbery at CVS Pharmacy, a robbery not charged in the\n\nindictment. The court admitted evidence tying Vernon to that robbery.\n\n\n                                E. Procedural History\n\n   At the conclusion of the government’s case, Vernon moved under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29 for a judgment of acquittal on Count One, the global conspiracy\n\ncharge, arguing that the government had failed to prove interdependence. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion. The jury convicted Vernon on all four charges\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fagainst him: one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, two counts of robbery,\n\nand one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.\n\n   Two weeks after the verdict, Vernon filed another motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal on Count One, this time alleging a fatal variance between his indictment\n\nand what the government ultimately proved at trial. Viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government, the district court denied the motion,\n\nconcluding that the government had presented sufficient evidence to establish the\n\nglobal conspiracy.\n\n   On appeal, Vernon raises many issues, all of which we discuss in turn below.\n\n\n                             II. THE INDICTMENT\n\n   “To pass constitutional muster, an indictment must contain all the essential\n\nelements of the charged offense.” United States v. Kovach, 208 F.3d 1215, 1218\n\n(10th Cir. 2000); see also United States v. Hathaway, 318 F.3d 1001, 1009 (10th\n\nCir. 2003). Appellate courts review de novo the sufficiency of an indictment.\n\nKovach, 208 F.3d at 1218. “An indictment is sufficient if it sets forth the\n\nelements of the offense charged, puts the defendant on fair notice of the charges\n\nagainst which he must defend, and enables the defendant to assert a double\n\njeopardy defense.” United States v. Bedford, 536 F.3d 1148, 1156 (10th Cir.\n\n2008) (reviewing for plain error) (quoting Hathaway, 318 F.3d at 1009).\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f   On appeal, Vernon argues that his indictment was constitutionally defective\n\nbecause, while the indictment alleged that all of the coconspirators were members\n\nor affiliates 9 of the Hoover Crips street gang, “there is no allegation that the\n\nHoover Crips street gang was involved in the conspiracy, or that any Defendant\n\nplanned any robberies in the capacity of a Hoover Crips leader, member, or\n\nassociate.” Appellant’s Br. at 30.\n\n   The government argues that the indictment was constitutionally sufficient\n\nbecause it alleged interdependent conduct, even if it did not use the word\n\n“interdependent.” “Specifically, the indictment alleged that the conspirators were\n\nmembers or affiliates of the Hoover Crips street gang, and described the different\n\nroles the conspirators played in the ongoing conspiracy, including meeting to plan\n\nthe robberies, stealing the vehicles that would be used, acting as lookouts, using\n\ncell phones to communicate about the robberies, brandishing and discharging\n\nfirearms, and demanding money and controlled substances.” Appellee’s Br. at 36.\n\n   Interdependence “exists where coconspirators ‘inten[d] to act together for\n\ntheir shared mutual benefit within the scope of the conspiracy charged.’” United\n\nStates v. Caldwell, 589 F.3d 1323, 1329 (10th Cir. 2009) (alteration in original)\n\n\n   9\n      The actual gang-certification records use the word “associate,” but the\nparties use the word “affiliate” to describe someone who has a relationship with\nthe Hoover Crips but is not a member. We will use the word “affiliate”\nthroughout this opinion for consistency with the parties’ usage.\n\n                                      - 10 -\n\f(quoting United States v. Evans, 970 F.2d 663, 671 (10th Cir. 1992)). In Bedford,\n\nwe evaluated whether the indictment in that case sufficiently alleged\n\ninterdependence. 536 F.3d at 1156–57. We held that “while not using the label\n\ninterdependent, the indictment described the interdependent behavior of the\n\ncoconspirators in the sections entitled ‘Manner and Means of the Conspiracy’ and\n\n‘Overt Acts.’ Thus, the indictment sufficiently charged [the] Defendant with the\n\nelements of conspiracy.” Id. at 1157 (citation omitted).\n\n   Here, the indictment alleged that “[i]t was part of the conspiracy that the\n\nconspirators were and are members or affiliates with the Hoover Crips street\n\ngang.” It went on to list the specific actions each defendant completed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy. For example, the indictment alleged that the\n\nmembers met to plan the robberies, stole vehicles to commit the robberies, and\n\nmet to divide the stolen goods from the robberies. While it did not use the word\n\n“interdependent,” the indictment alleged specific interdependent behavior\n\nthroughout the “Overt Acts” section.\n\n   We think that Vernon’s indictment was constitutionally sufficient. Our\n\nconclusion here is best demonstrated by comparing United States v. Prentiss, 273\n\nF.3d 1277, 1283–84 (10th Cir. 2001), where we vacated the defendant’s\n\nconviction for arson, with Bedford, 536 F.3d at 1156–57 (affirming the\n\nsufficiency of the defendant’s conspiracy indictment). In Prentiss, the uncharged\n\n\n                                       - 11 -\n\felement was that either the victim or the defendant was a Native American, which\n\nwas not mentioned in the indictment, 273 F.3d at 1278; in Bedford, by contrast,\n\nthe indictment listed specific behavior establishing interdependence for the\n\nconspiracy but did not mention the element expressly, 536 F.3d at 1156–57. We\n\nnonetheless concluded that the indictment in Bedford was constitutionally\n\nsufficient. 536 F.3d at 1157. The indictment in Prentiss, conversely, was\n\nconstitutionally defective. 273 F.3d at 1283–84.\n\n   We think that Vernon’s indictment is akin to Bedford, not Prentiss. The\n\nindictment described the coconspirators’ alleged interdependent actions. 10 It put\n\nVernon on notice of the charges against which he had to defend and enabled him\n\nto assert a double-jeopardy defense. Vernon’s indictment was constitutionally\n\nsufficient. We affirm the district court.\n\n\n                            III. MOTIONS TO SEVER\n\n   We next consider Vernon’s argument regarding his unsuccessful motion to\n\nsever. We review the denial of a motion to sever for an abuse of discretion.\n\nEvans, 970 F.2d at 675. We will not reverse absent a strong showing of prejudice.\n   10\n      Whether the indictment sufficiently alleged interdependence is a distinct\nquestion from whether there was sufficient evidence to prove it. For instance, the\nindictment alleged that the coconspirators had operated together as members of\nthe Hoover Crips street gang. At the indictment stage, this adequately alleged\ninterdependence. But as we conclude below, the gang evidence introduced at trial\nwas insufficient to establish interdependence for the global conspiracy.\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fId. “Neither a mere allegation that [the] defendant would have a better chance of\n\nacquittal in a separate trial, nor a complaint of the ‘spillover effect’ [of damaging\n\nevidence] is sufficient to warrant severance.” United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d\n\n419, 434 (10th Cir. 1995) (second alteration in original) (quoting United States v.\n\nLevine, 983 F.2d 165, 167 (10th Cir. 1992)). In a conspiracy trial, we presume\n\nthat persons charged together should be tried together. United States v. Stiger,\n\n413 F.3d 1185, 1197 (10th Cir. 2005); Edwards, 69 F.3d at 434. Further, joinder\n\nof a conspiracy count in the same indictment and trial as the underlying\n\nsubstantive offenses is proper under Fed R. Crim. P. 8(a). United States v.\n\nThompson, 286 F.3d 950, 968 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\n   Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 14, Vernon filed a pretrial motion to sever his charged\n\noffenses into two trials and to sever his trial from the other defendants. 11 Vernon\n\nattempted to show the necessary prejudice under Rule 14 by identifying certain\n\ncoconspirator statements that, if introduced at trial, would prejudice him. Taking\n\nits cue from Rule 14(b), 12 the district court required the government to deliver to\n\n\n\n   11\n      Specifically, Vernon asked the district court to sever and try separately\nCount Two, which related to the IBC robbery. Vernon also requested the district\ncourt to sever Counts Five and Six, which involved the robbery committed by\nVernon, Lewis, Deandre, Devers, and Tiger.\n   12\n     This rule requires that “[b]efore ruling on a defendant’s motion to sever, the\ncourt may order a government attorney to deliver to the court for in camera\n\n                                       - 13 -\n\fthe court for in camera inspection any coconspirator statements it intended to use\n\nat trial. After reviewing that evidence, the district court excluded one of Vernon’s\n\ncoconspirator’s statements, concluding it was inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E) because it was not uttered during and in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy. The district court denied the severance motions. 13\n\n\n\ninspection any defendant’s statement that the government intends to use as\nevidence.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(b).\n   13\n        The court explained:\n\n        Based upon the evidence presented by the government, this court\n        finds that the government did not present independent admissible\n        evidence of a conspiracy. During said hearing numerous statements\n        were identified as having been made by one or more of the\n        defendants. According to the government’s summation of the\n        evidence, however, the only statements which the government will\n        seek to admit as co-conspirators statements were made by Defendant\n        Devers to Duncan Herron. Since the government’s evidence failed to\n        prove a conspiracy, this court finds said statements are not\n        admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).\n\nR. vol. 1, at 448. Vernon points to this statement in support of his argument that\nthe trials and charges should have been severed because the government failed to\nproperly indict or prove a conspiracy. In equating a preliminary finding of\nconspiracy enabling the government to introduce coconspirator statements under\nRule 801(d)(2)(E) with the sufficiency of a conspiracy charge in an indictment,\nVernon errs. See generally United States v. Urena, 27 F.3d 1487, 1490 (10th Cir.\n1994) (noting that the defendant’s contention that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion for judgment of acquittal “amount[ed] to a simple hearsay\nobjection”) (“The strongly preferred order of proof in determining the\nadmissibility of an alleged coconspirator statement is first to hold a [hearing] . . .\noutside the presence of the jury to determine by a preponderance of the evidence\nthe existence of a predicate conspiracy.”).\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\f   To this court, Vernon makes a slightly different argument under Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 8(b), asserting that the claims against Vernon had to be severed from unrelated\n\ncharges against codefendants. He confuses the issues: Rule 8 is a permissive rule\n\nthat allows courts to join defendants and charges under certain circumstances;\n\nRule 14 provides relief from prejudicial joinder. Vernon admits that if the\n\nindictment had properly alleged a global conspiracy, then the district court could\n\nproperly join the counts under Rule 8.\n\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a) governs the joinder of offenses: the indictment may\n\ncharge a defendant “with [two] or more offenses if the offenses charged . . . are\n\nof the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\n\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 8(b) governs the joinder of defendants: the indictment “may charge\n\n[two] or more defendants if they are alleged to have participated in the same act\n\nor transaction, or in the same series of acts or transactions, constituting an\n\noffense or offenses.” We construe Rule 8 broadly to “allow liberal joinder to\n\nenhance the efficiency of the judicial system.” United States v. Jones, 530 F.3d\n\n1292, 1298 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Johnson, 130 F.3d 1420,\n\n1427 (10th Cir. 1997)).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\f   We do not think that the trial court erred in denying either severance motion.\n\nFirst, joinder of offenses was proper under Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a) because the\n\nindividual robberies were alleged as the overt acts establishing the conspiracy.\n\nSecond, the district court properly joined the defendants’ trials under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 8(b) because the defendants were charged together as coconspirators. 14\n\n   Finally, Vernon makes no argument regarding any resulting prejudice. At\n\nmost, he argues that he “was forced to defend himself in a trial that involved\n\npresentation of gang evidence and evidence regarding three robberies the\n\ngovernment concedes he did not commit.” Appellant’s Br. at 32. Under Edwards,\n\nthis is insufficient to establish prejudice. See 69 F.3d at 434. While Vernon\n\nbroadly alleges prejudice, he does not point to any specific instances in his trial\n\nwhere prejudice occurred. This broad contention is insufficient. 15 See United\n\nStates v. Pursley, 474 F.3d 757, 766 (10th Cir. 2007) (“To establish prejudice, a\n\ndefendant must point to a ‘specific trial right’ that was compromised or show the\n\njury was ‘prevent[ed] . . . from making a reliable judgment about guilt or\n\n\n\n   14\n      We note that our conclusion here does not change because we later conclude\nthat the government failed to prove the global conspiracy. At the time of the\ndistrict court’s order, the district court had properly joined the charges and trials.\n   15\n      For example, if two defendants intend to present antagonistic defenses, a\ndistrict court can conclude that the joinder of their trials would prejudice the\ndefendants. See, e.g., United States v. Pursley, 474 F.3d 757, 765–66 (10th Cir.\n2007).\n\n                                        - 16 -\n\finnocence.’”) (alterations in original) (quoting Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S.\n\n534, 539 (1993)).\n\n   We affirm the district court’s denial of the severance motions.\n\n\n                                IV. VARIANCE\n\n   Next, Vernon argues that the government failed to prove the global conspiracy\n\ncharged in Count One. To prove a conspiracy, the government must prove four\n\nelements: (1) that two or more people agreed to violate the law; (2) that the\n\ndefendant knew at least the conspiracy’s essential objectives; (3) that the\n\ndefendant knowingly became a part of the conspiracy; and (4) that the\n\ncoconspirators were interdependent. United States v. Sells, 477 F.3d 1226, 1235\n\n(10th Cir. 2007). Vernon disputes only whether the government introduced\n\nenough evidence to establish the fourth element, interdependence—and if it did\n\nnot, whether its failure to introduce sufficient evidence constitutes a fatal\n\nvariance.\n\n   “We treat a conspiracy variance claim as an attack on the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s finding that each defendant was a member of the\n\nsame conspiracy.” United States v. Carnagie, 533 F.3d 1231, 1237 (10th Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting United States v. Griffin, 493 F.3d 856, 862 (7th Cir. 2007)). We\n\nreview de novo challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. United States v.\n\n\n\n                                      - 17 -\n\fWells, 739 F.3d 511, 525 (10th Cir. 2014). We must take the evidence and draw\n\nall reasonable inferences in favor of the government. Id. “Distinguishing between\n\na single, large conspiracy and several smaller conspiracies is often difficult; we\n\nwill generally defer to the jury’s determination of the matter.” Caldwell, 589 F.3d\n\nat 1329. The existence of a variance that would support acquittal is a legal\n\nquestion also reviewed de novo. Id. at 1328, 1333.\n\n   Interdependence is the focal point for determining whether a single conspiracy\n\nexisted, and it “exists where coconspirators ‘inten[d] to act together for their\n\nshared mutual benefit within the scope of the conspiracy charged.’” Id. at 1329\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Evans, 970 F.2d at 671). “[I]nterdependence\n\nexists where each [coconspirator’s] activities constituted essential and integral\n\nsteps toward the realization of a common, illicit goal.” Edwards, 69 F.3d at 431\n\n(quoting United States v. Fox, 902 F.2d 1508, 1514 (10th Cir. 1990)) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). It requires that all coconspirators have a single criminal\n\nobjective, not just similar or parallel objectives between similarly situated people.\n\nEvans, 970 F.2d at 670. We must evaluate “what kind of agreement or\n\nunderstanding existed as to each defendant.” United States v. Record, 873 F.2d\n\n1363, 1368 (10th Cir. 1989) (quoting United States v. Borelli, 336 F.2d 376, 384\n\n(2d Cir. 1964)). Circumstantial evidence can often prove this. United States v.\n\nHutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011, 1035 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n\n                                       - 18 -\n\f   A “variance arises when an indictment charges a single conspiracy but the\n\nevidence presented at trial proves only the existence of multiple conspiracies.”\n\nCarnagie, 533 F.3d at 1237 (citing United States v. Ailsworth, 138 F.3d 843, 848\n\n(10th Cir. 1998)). The prohibition against variances is intended to protect the\n\nfairness of the defendant’s trial. See generally Wayne R. LaFave et al., 5 Crim.\n\nProc. § 19.6(b) (3d ed. 2014) (discussing the origin of the prohibition against\n\nvariances from Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78 (1935), and the policy\n\njustifications for the rule). A variance constitutes reversible error only if it affects\n\nthe substantial rights of the defendant. Edwards, 69 F.3d at 433; see also\n\nCaldwell, 589 F.3d at 1333.\n\n   We explained in United States v. Harrison that “[a] defendant’s substantial\n\nrights are not prejudiced merely because the ‘defendant is convicted upon\n\nevidence which tends to show a narrower scheme than that contained in the\n\nindictment, provided that the narrower scheme is fully included within the\n\nindictment.’” 942 F.2d 751, 758 (10th Cir. 1991) (quoting United States v. Mobile\n\nMaterials, 881 F.2d 866, 874 (10th Cir. 1989)); see also Carnagie, 533 F.3d at\n\n1241 (“When a narrower scheme than the one alleged is fully included within the\n\nindictment and proved, we have repeatedly held that a defendant’s substantial\n\nrights are not prejudiced.”). A variance can be prejudicial by either failing to put\n\nthe defendant on sufficient notice of the charges against him, United States v.\n\n\n                                         - 19 -\n\fWindrix, 405 F.3d 1146, 1154 (10th Cir. 2005), or by causing the jury to\n\ndetermine the defendant’s guilt by relying on evidence presented against other\n\ndefendants who were involved in separate conspiracies (the so-called “spillover\n\neffect”), Edwards, 69 F.3d at 433. When deciding whether a prejudicial guilt-\n\nspillover occurred, we consider (1) whether the separate conspiracies affected the\n\njury’s ability to evaluate each defendant’s individual actions, (2) whether the\n\nvariance caused the jury to misuse evidence, and (3) the strength of the evidence\n\nunderlying the conviction. Carnagie, 533 F.3d at 1241.\n\n   In this case, in Count One, the government charged the defendants, including\n\nVernon, with conspiring to rob banks, credit unions, and pharmacies throughout\n\nTulsa as members or affiliates of the Hoover Crips. The government listed the\n\nfollowing manner and means of the conspiracy: (1) “[T]he conspirators were and\n\nare members or affiliates with the Hoover Crips street gang”; (2) “[T]he\n\nconspirators   would   and   did   commit      robberies of   businesses,   including\n\npharmacies, banks and a credit union”; (3) “[T]he conspirators would and did use\n\nfirearms during the robberies”; (4) “[T]he conspirators would and did use cellular\n\nphones to communicate before, during and after robberies”; and (5) “[T]he\n\nconspirators would and did threaten persons who were potential witnesses to\n\nrobberies.” Count One listed 26 overt acts that various conspirators allegedly\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\ftook in furtherance of the conspiracy. These overt acts included six robberies\n\ncharged directly against various combinations of the charged conspirators.\n\n   In Vernon’s pretrial motion to dismiss Count One of the indictment, he argued\n\nthat there was a fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence proved at\n\ntrial. He argued that the indictment alleged a global conspiracy, but that the\n\nevidence would show only multiple, smaller conspiracies. The district court\n\ndenied this motion, but it advised Vernon that he could “reurge this motion after\n\nall of the evidence has been presented at trial.” The government’s theory at trial\n\nwas that Vernon and his coconspirators were members of the Hoover Crips, and\n\nthrough this association, they had conspired to commit multiple robberies.\n\nVernon argues that this evidence was insufficient to prove interdependence for\n\nthe global conspiracy.\n\n   We agree with Vernon that the record shows insufficient evidence that the\n\ncharged coconspirators shared a single, shared unlawful goal or purpose of\n\nrobbing banks, credit unions, and pharmacies as the indictment charged. 16 See\n\nUnited States v. Daily, 921 F.2d 994, 1007 (10th Cir. 1990) (“[T]he focal point of\n\nthe [interdependence] analysis is whether the alleged co-conspirators were united\n\n   16\n     We think that the indictment properly alleged a single, shared unlawful goal\nor purpose for the global conspiracy, but the evidence at trial instead only\nestablished multiple, separate conspiracies. Accordingly, we do not need to\naddress Vernon’s argument that if the indictment alleged multiple conspiracies, it\nwas duplicitous.\n\n                                      - 21 -\n\fin a common unlawful goal or purpose.”), overruled on other grounds by United\n\nStates v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506 (1995). As we explained in Carnagie, “[a]\n\ncommon goal, however, is not by itself enough to establish interdependence:\n\n[w]hat is required is a shared, single criminal objective, not just similar or\n\nparallel objectives between similarly situated people.” 533 F.3d at 1239\n\n(emphasis in original) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Evans, 970 F.2d at\n\n671). Conspiring to commit one of the individual robberies, without more, does\n\nnot amount to conspiring to commit all of the robberies. Even though the general\n\nobjective between the individual robberies was the same—the robbery of banks,\n\ncredit unions, or pharmacies for drugs or money—that does not necessarily mean\n\nthat the separate groups were interdependent. See id. at 1238–40.\n\n   For the global conspiracy, the jury had to infer that because all of the\n\nconspirators were members or affiliates of the Hoover Crips, they must have had\n\na shared, criminal objective sufficient to establish interdependence. We do not\n\nthink that is enough. In United States v. Robinson, 978 F.2d 1554, 1563 (10th Cir.\n\n1992),   we   explained   that,   while    gang-affiliation   evidence   is   probative\n\ncircumstantial evidence tending to show agreement, purpose, and knowledge for a\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 22 -\n\fconspiracy, gang-affiliation evidence “alone could not support a conviction.” 17\n\nThe defendants in Robinson stood trial for conspiring to distribute, possess, and\n\nmanufacture cocaine base. Id. at 1558. In that case, unlike here, the government\n\nadmitted evidence beyond gang membership to prove the drug conspiracy. Id. at\n\n1563. For instance, there was “uncontroverted testimony that the main purpose of\n\nthe [gang] was to sell cocaine” and “ample evidence of drug trafficking in\n\naddition   to   the   gang    related    items   discovered    at   the   apartment\n\n. . . .” Id. at 1561–63. For the conspirators in this case, we see no evidence, other\n\nthan gang membership, that shows or provides a sufficient inference of a shared\n\ncriminal goal to rob banks and pharmacies.\n\n   For instance, there was no evidence showing that the individual robbers\n\n“benefitted from or depended upon the success of the” other robbers or robberies.\n\nSee Carnagie, 533 F.3d at 1240 (citing United States v. Yehling, 456 F.3d 1236,\n\n1241 (10th Cir. 2006) (“[E]ach coconspirator’s actions must facilitate the\n\nendeavors of other alleged coconspirators or facilitate the venture as a whole.”)).\n\nThere must be at least some evidence of “mutual dependence.” Id.; see also\n\nKotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 754–55 (1946). The conspirators’\n\naffiliations with the Hoover Crips, by itself, are not enough to establish\n\n   17\n     We note that the gang-certification evidence introduced at trial only showed\nthat Vernon was a known affiliate of the Hoover Crips, not necessarily a full-\nfledged member.\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\finterdependence. Lacking from the government’s proof was any showing that for\n\nany particular robbery, anyone but the robbers committing it benefitted in any\n\nway—that is, we see no evidence that nonparticipating gang members or affiliates\n\nshared in any stolen drugs or money. In one very real sense, each individual bank,\n\ncredit union, or pharmacy robbery harmed—not benefitted—the nonparticipating\n\nbank robbers. After each robbery, police became more alert to future related\n\nrobberies and began to see that Hoover Crips members or affiliates were\n\ninvolved.\n\n   The government argues that the commonalities between the robberies and the\n\ngang evidence should be enough. We disagree. While commonalities might be\n\nenough if the means and method were unique in some way, that simply was not\n\nthe case here. Cf., e.g., United States v. Carroll, 207 F.3d 465, 469–70 (8th Cir.\n\n2000) (finding the means and methods used in two bank robberies too generic to\n\npermit an inference of identity under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)). The government tried\n\nto rely on the gang-affiliation evidence to link all of these facts together and paint\n\na picture of a gang-based robbery conspiracy. It also cited the discharge of\n\nfirearms and the demand of money and controlled substances during the robberies\n\nin an attempt to prove interdependence. The use of cell phones, facemasks, guns,\n\nbags, threats, and a stolen getaway car does not elevate this string of robberies\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\finto one where we can infer that the same group committed all of them. We do\n\nnot see any uniqueness in method that would support interdependence.\n\n   Therefore, we conclude that the government introduced insufficient evidence\n\nof interdependence to prove the global conspiracy as Count One charged. But this\n\ndoes not end our inquiry. In this situation, if the government showed that Vernon\n\nconspired to commit one or more of the individual robberies, we can still affirm\n\nhis conspiracy conviction under our circuit’s variance doctrine. See, e.g.,\n\nCaldwell, 589 F.3d at 1332–33. This requires us to analyze (1) whether the\n\ngovernment proved that Vernon had conspired to commit one or more of the\n\nindividual robberies, and (2) whether this discrepancy constitutes a prejudicial\n\nvariance.\n\n   In fact, Vernon concedes the first inquiry by admitting that multiple, smaller\n\nconspiracies were established: 18\n\n        At most, a juror could have inferred Vernon robbed a bank by\n        himself, agreed to participate in a conspiracy to rob the Metro (with\n        one group of people), and then engaged in a second conspiracy to rob\n        the Arvest Bank (with his brother or brothers, who were not involved\n        in the other robberies). However, no evidence links those robberies\n        to each other or to some common endeavor.\n\n   18\n      Even had Vernon not conceded this argument, we think sufficient evidence\nestablishes two individual conspiracies. We agree with Vernon that there was\ninsufficient evidence introduced at trial to establish that he conspired to rob IBC\nBank. But even excluding the IBC Bank robbery, the evidence at trial still\nshowed two narrower conspiracies—a conspiracy to rob the Metro Pharmacy and\na conspiracy to rob the Arvest Bank.\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\fAppellant’s Br. at 36. In his Reply Brief, he goes even further: “Vernon does not\n\ndispute that each robbery (excluding the IBC robbery) had more than one\n\nparticipant and was planned by its robbers, whoever they were.” Appellant’s\n\nReply Br. at 7, 9 (“At most, the evidence shows that different people on different\n\ndates and locations got together to plan unrelated robberies.”). Vernon rests his\n\nappeal on the alleged prejudice that resulted from this variance. To determine if\n\nVernon suffered prejudice, we look at whether he received adequate notice of the\n\nsmaller conspiracies and whether there was prejudicial guilt spillover.\n\n\n\n\n                 A. Did Vernon Receive Adequate Notice of the\n                     Smaller Conspiracies Actually Proven?\n\n   We conclude that the indictment adequately notified Vernon of the smaller\n\nconspiracies ultimately presented at trial. See, e.g., Caldwell, 589 F.3d at 1333\n\n(“When an indictment charges a conspiracy among multiple individuals, it\n\ngenerally provides sufficient notice to a defendant that she must defend against\n\nthe smaller conspiracies.”). The indictment fully contemplated the smaller\n\nconspiracies. Based on the indictment, Vernon knew that the government had\n\ncharged him with committing two robberies (not including his earlier conviction\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 26 -\n\ffor the Arvest Bank robbery). By reading the indictment, Vernon could fully\n\nanticipate evidence about the Hoover Crips and his conduct in committing the\n\nIBC Bank, Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest Bank robberies. This adequately notified\n\nhim of his need to defend against the smaller conspiracies ultimately proved.\n\n\n                    B. Was There Prejudicial Guilt Spillover?\n\n   Second, “[a] defendant’s substantial rights are affected in the context of a\n\nvariance when the jury determines a defendant’s guilt by relying on evidence\n\nadduced against coconspirators who were involved in separate conspiracies.”\n\nEdwards, 69 F.3d at 433. To evaluate whether a prejudicial spillover occurred,\n\nreviewing courts look to three factors: (1) whether the separate conspiracies\n\naffected the jury’s ability to evaluate each defendant’s individual actions;\n\n(2) whether the variance caused the jury to misuse evidence; and (3) the strength\n\nof the evidence underlying the conviction. Carnagie, 533 F.3d at 1241. Applying\n\nthese factors, we conclude that there was no spillover-guilt effect in this case.\n\n\n         i. Did the Separate Conspiracies Affect the Jury’s Ability to\n                Evaluate Each Defendant’s Individual Actions?\n\n   Evaluating the first Carnagie factor, we conclude that the evidence of separate\n\nconspiracies did not impair the jury’s ability to segregate each conspirator’s\n\nactions. As the Supreme Court explained in Kotteakos, the greater number of\n\n\n\n                                        - 27 -\n\fdefendants tried and conspiracies established, the more likely it is that prejudice\n\nwill result. 328 U.S. at 772–73. In that case, more than thirty people were\n\nindicted, with nineteen tried together, and at least eight separate conspiracies\n\nestablished. See id at 766.\n\n   The Court created no fixed rule based on the numbers for determining when\n\nprejudice occurs. Id. at 773–74 (expressing no opinion on what “marks the limit,”\n\nbut making clear that it exists somewhere between Berger and Kotteakos).\n\nReviewing courts must look to the facts of each case to determine whether a\n\ndefendant has suffered substantial prejudice. See generally Carnagie, 533 F.3d at\n\n1242 (holding that trying three defendants together for three separate\n\nconspiracies, given other factors, did not constitute prejudice). In this case, there\n\nwere only three defendants tried together (Vernon, Dejuan, and Deandre) and five\n\nconspiracies proven (Dooley Pharmacy, Barnes Pharmacy, Metro Pharmacy,\n\nTulsa Credit Union, and Arvest Bank). As in Carnagie, “the number of\n\ndefendants tried and conspiracies proven do not reach the magnitude of\n\nKotteakos, and thus the risk of prejudice is not as great.” Id. (citing Kotteakos,\n\n328 U.S. at 774).\n\n   In support of his argument that he suffered prejudice from evidentiary\n\nspillover, Vernon makes three arguments: (1) “the government admitted and\n\nhighlighted a great deal of evidence about crimes Vernon clearly did not\n\n\n                                       - 28 -\n\fcommit”; (2) “[t]he government also used the Global Conspiracy theory as a\n\njustification to present gang evidence at trial”; and (3) “the jury’s special\n\ninterrogatory answers in connection with the verdict against Vernon contained\n\nadverse findings about the Dooley Pharmacy, the T. Roy Barnes [Pharmacy], and\n\nTulsa Municipal Employees Credit Union robberies, absent any evidence linking\n\nVernon to those crimes.” Appellant’s Reply Br. at 16.\n\n   Vernon’s first argument is unpersuasive. There were very clear distinctions\n\nbetween the evidence that was relevant to each defendant. As in Carnagie, the\n\nevidence here was not so intricate as to render the jury unable to separate the\n\nevidence associated with each defendant’s individual actions. See 533 F.3d at\n\n1242. Moreover, the evidence from the other robberies was “of the exact same\n\ncharacter” as the evidence from the three robberies involving Vernon. See id.\n\n“We have held that such a similarity between different transactions cuts against a\n\nfinding of substantial prejudice.” Id.; cf. United States v. Bertolotti, 529 F.2d 149,\n\n157 (2d Cir. 1975) (finding a prejudicial variance based in part on the fact that\n\n“the crimes of the various appellants . . . scarcely resembled one another”).\n\n   Nor does Vernon’s second argument persuade us. As we explain below, we\n\nconclude that the district court properly admitted gang-affiliation evidence\n\nagainst Vernon under Fed. R. Evid. 403. Its probative value, even in light of the\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice, would have existed even if Vernon had stood trial for\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fconspiring to commit the three smaller robberies. The evidence still would have\n\ntended to show purpose, knowledge, and intent to commit the three robberies,\n\nespecially for the Metro Pharmacy robbery, which involved a wider, more diverse\n\ngroup of coconspirators (than the Arvest Bank robbery), who shared ties with\n\neach other through the Hoover Crips. Because we conclude that this evidence was\n\nadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 403, we also conclude that its admission does not\n\nconstitute substantial prejudice for the purpose of the variance analysis. Vernon\n\nmakes no particularized argument regarding why the gang evidence caused him\n\nsubstantial prejudice; he simply asserts that it did.\n\n   Evaluating his final argument, we fail to see what “adverse findings” the\n\njury’s special interrogatory answers contain. In our view, the special\n\ninterrogatories show that the jury understood that it could hold each defendant\n\naccountable only for the evidence introduced against him.\n\n\n           ii. Did the Variance Cause the Jury to Misuse Evidence?\n\n   Under Carnagie’s second prong, we must examine whether a variance caused\n\njuror confusion about the legal limitations on the use of certain evidence. 533\n\nF.3d at 1243. Vernon does not allege this type of prejudice. In fact, the district\n\ncourt excluded all coconspirator statements that the government had sought to\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 30 -\n\fintroduce under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). After reviewing the record, we\n\nconclude that there was no prejudice from jury confusion.\n\n\n                  iii. Was there Sufficiently Strong Evidence\n                        Underlying the Jury’s Decision?\n\n   Under Carnagie’s final prong, we must consider the strength of the evidence\n\nunderlying the jury’s conviction on Count One, the global conspiracy. To do so,\n\nwe examine the evidence supporting the “smaller, separate conspiracies.”\n\nCarnagie, 533 F.3d at 1243. As first noted earlier, we conclude that the\n\ngovernment presented sufficient evidence to prove that Vernon conspired with\n\nothers to rob Metro Pharmacy and Arvest Bank.\n\n   For the Metro Pharmacy robbery, Herron testified that Vernon had planned\n\nand participated in the robbery. Herron walked into the pharmacy to buy some\n\nmedicine, texted Devers as he was leaving, and held open the door for Vernon,\n\nLewis, and Devers because customers had to be buzzed into the pharmacy. Once\n\ninside, those three men robbed the pharmacy, and two of the robbers displayed\n\nguns, with the third robber (Vernon) carrying a bag. After the robbery, the men,\n\nexcept Herron, got into a van parked outside of the pharmacy and drove away.\n\n   For Arvest Bank, the government presented evidence that two armed, masked\n\nmen robbed it. The tellers gave the robbers previously concealed and marked $50\n\nbait bills and a strap of $20 bills containing a GPS tracker. Officers immediately\n\n                                      - 31 -\n\fbegan receiving location updates from the tracker. The device stopped moving\n\nnear 1109 East Pine Street, which was near Vernon’s known residence at 1107\n\nEast Pine Street. The officers obtained a search warrant for Vernon’s house.\n\nBefore they executed the search warrant, the officers arrested Vernon and Stanley\n\nafter they emerged from the house. Upon executing the search warrant, the\n\nofficers found money stolen from the bank, the GPS tracker, a Glock pistol, a\n\nhooded black sweatshirt, a ski mask, gloves, and dark-colored pants, all of which\n\nthey believed had been used in the robbery. This is enough evidence to prove that\n\nVernon was involved in the conspiracy to rob Arvest Bank. That being so, we\n\nconclude that Vernon did not suffer prejudice from any guilt transference.\n\n   In sum, we conclude that Vernon did not suffer substantial prejudice from the\n\nvariance. We affirm his conviction on Count One.\n\n\n                          V. INTRINSIC EVIDENCE\n\n   Vernon argues next that some evidence the district court admitted as intrinsic\n\nto the charged crimes was instead extrinsic. At trial, the government introduced\n\nevidence establishing all six charged robberies, including the three involving\n\nVernon (IBC, Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest Bank), and one robbery not charged to\n\nanyone (CVS Pharmacy). Under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), Vernon objected to the\n\ncourt’s admitting evidence of any robbery not charged to Vernon as improper\n\n\n\n                                      - 32 -\n\fbecause there was no global conspiracy. The trial court admitted all of the\n\nevidence, finding that it was intrinsic evidence, outside the scope of Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b), because it was “closely related to the conspiracy charged and [fell] within\n\nthe relevant time frame.”\n\n   Vernon argues on appeal that the government presented three extra trials\n\nrelating to robberies Vernon certainly did not commit. The government responds\n\nthat the challenged evidence was intrinsic evidence, not subject to Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b), because it all was either charged to one of the coconspirators or it took\n\nplace during the same timeframe as the conspiracy.\n\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) applies only to evidence of acts extrinsic to the charged\n\ncrime. Record, 873 F.2d at 1372 n.5. An uncharged act may not be considered\n\nextrinsic if it was part of the scheme for which a defendant is being prosecuted,\n\nid., or inextricably intertwined with the charged crime such that a witness’s\n\ntestimony would have been confusing and incomplete without mention of the\n\nprior act, United States v. Johnson, 42 F.3d 1312, 1316 (10th Cir. 1994). To be\n\nconsidered intrinsic evidence, rather than extrinsic, “the government’s use of\n\nevidence of wrongful, uncharged acts [must be] necessary to contextualize” the\n\nevidence introduced at trial. United States v. Hood, 774 F.3d. 638, 644 (10th Cir.\n\n2014) (concluding that evidence establishing why the police officers were at a\n\nparticular location qualified as intrinsic evidence, not subject to Fed. R. Evid.\n\n\n                                       - 33 -\n\f404(b)). We review the trial court’s decision to admit evidence for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Neal, 718 F.2d 1505, 1509–10 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\n\n                         A. Evidence of the Traffic Stop\n\n   First, Vernon appeals the district court’s decision to admit evidence of a\n\ntraffic stop involving Lewis, Eddie Brown, and Patrick Crisp. In an attempt to\n\nprove a substantive charge against Deandre for the Credit Union robbery, the\n\ngovernment introduced evidence of the traffic stop, which occurred almost a\n\nmonth after that robbery. The evidence showed that during a search of the car, the\n\nofficers found marijuana, two bottles of codeine cough syrup, and a large amount\n\nof cash. The government argued, and the district court agreed, that this evidence\n\nhelped prove the Credit Union robbery.\n\n   We decline to decide whether the district court properly admitted this evidence\n\nas intrinsic evidence for the Credit Union robbery because any error was\n\nharmless. The admission of this evidence constitutes a nonconstitutional error, so\n\nwe only decide whether the evidence, in light of the entire record,\n\n(1) substantially influenced the outcome of the trial or (2) leaves us in grave\n\ndoubt as to whether it had such an effect. Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 764–65\n\n(establishing the harmless error rule); United States v. Tome, 61 F.3d 1446, 1455\n\n(10th Cir. 1995). The traffic stop did not even involve Vernon, and he makes no\n\n\n\n                                      - 34 -\n\fparticularized argument as to how this evidence substantially influenced the\n\noutcome of his trial. Accordingly, error here, if any, was harmless.\n\n\n                   B. Evidence of the CVS Pharmacy Robbery\n\n   Vernon complains that the district court allowed evidence of the uncharged\n\nCVS Pharmacy robbery just because it occurred within the timeframe of the\n\nconspiracy and was similar to the charged robberies. Separate from his concern\n\nover whether this evidence was intrinsic, Vernon argues that the district court\n\nerred in admitting this evidence because there was no proof that Vernon was\n\ninvolved in the CVS robbery.\n\n   In response, the government contends that this evidence helped establish\n\ninterdependence by demonstrating the individual robbers’ specific roles over the\n\ncourse of multiple robberies. Accordingly, the government argues, the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the CVS robbery as\n\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracy.\n\n   We disagree with the government. Herron told Officer Ryden that Vernon\n\nparticipated in the Metro Pharmacy robbery. Based on this information from\n\nHerron, Officer Ryden compared the video from the Metro Pharmacy robbery to\n\nthe CVS Pharmacy robbery, attempting to ascertain whether any one person\n\nparticipated in both robberies. Based on the video footage, Officer Ryden thought\n\n\n\n                                       - 35 -\n\fthat Lewis participated in both because of his physical appearance, his left-\n\nhandedness, and his use of a firearm in both robberies. He also concluded that\n\nDevers participated in both because of his physical appearance and clothing worn\n\nin both robberies. Finally, Officer Ryden thought that the third person in both\n\nrobberies was Vernon because he looked similar in the videos and he carried a\n\nbag, not a gun.\n\n   During its closing argument, the government discussed the CVS Pharmacy\n\nrobbery, saying, “Following [the Metro Pharmacy robbery], the CVS store was\n\nrobbed. And exactly what happens then? They have now learned, thanks to the\n\nMetro robbery, you steal a vehicle, you don’t leave anything in it.” The\n\ngovernment then went on to compare the CVS robbery to the other robberies,\n\narguing that Vernon was one of the men in the tape from the CVS robbery.\n\n   To admit evidence as intrinsic—and to avoid having to comply with Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 404(b)’s requirements—the evidence must provide context for other\n\nadmissible evidence or witness testimony. The district court explained that “such\n\nevidence can be considered intrinsic evidence falling outside of Rule 404(b)\n\nusually—and this is where I’m hanging my hat on this—usually when that\n\nevidence is closely related to the conspiracy charged and falls within the relevant\n\ntime frame.” The court went on, “I think that describes the evidence that I\n\nanticipate the government intends to introduce. . . . I [find] that it is intrinsically\n\n\n                                        - 36 -\n\fconnected to the evidence that’s been put on of the other robberies so it comes\n\ninto evidence under that theory.” As such, the court concluded that this evidence\n\nfell outside Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)’s scope.\n\n   This is not enough. The CVS Pharmacy robbery evidence needed to provide\n\ncontext to other admissible evidence, or more relevant here, it needed to\n\ncontextualize a witness’s testimony. In Hood, for example, the only way the\n\nofficer could explain being at the apartment complex where he encountered\n\nHood was by referring to the burglary investigation. 774 F.3d at 644. If the\n\nofficer had not mentioned that investigation and background, his testimony about\n\nbeing at the apartment complex would have confused the jury. Id. So had Officer\n\nRyden’s investigation of the CVS Pharmacy robbery led him to suspect Vernon’s\n\ninvolvement in the Metro Pharmacy robbery, or something similar, the CVS\n\nPharmacy robbery evidence would provide context for evidence of the charged\n\ncrime. But that was not the case here. The CVS Pharmacy robbery was merely\n\nevidence of a robbery occurring around the same time, nothing more. Minimizing\n\njury confusion is the most important consideration in determining whether\n\nsomething is intrinsic evidence, not simply when the alleged bad act took place.\n\n   We therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting\n\nthe evidence of the CVS Pharmacy robbery. However, we also conclude that this\n\nerror was harmless. Because the admission of the CVS Pharmacy evidence\n\n\n                                       - 37 -\n\fconstitutes a nonconstitutional error, we review only for whether the evidence, in\n\nlight of the entire record, (1) substantially influenced the outcome of the trial, or\n\n(2) leaves us in grave doubt as to whether it had such an effect. Kotteakos, 328\n\nU.S. at 764–65; Tome, 61 F.3d at 1455.\n\n   In this case, given the breadth and depth of admissible evidence establishing\n\nthe charged robberies, we cannot say that the admission of the CVS Pharmacy\n\nrobbery evidence substantially influenced the outcome of the trial. Certainly, the\n\ngovernment used the evidence to attempt to establish Vernon’s guilt for the\n\nglobal conspiracy count by showing the commonalities between the CVS\n\nPharmacy robbery and the other robberies. But as we have already held above, the\n\ngovernment failed to prove the global conspiracy. As such, the CVS Pharmacy\n\nevidence had little bearing on the trial’s outcome. Further, the admission of the\n\nevidence does not leave us in grave doubt as to whether it had such an effect. We\n\nare therefore confident that the error was harmless, and we affirm the district\n\ncourt.\n\n\n                    VI. GANG-AFFILIATION EVIDENCE\n\n   Vernon also appeals the district court’s decision to admit the gang-affiliation\n\nevidence, arguing it was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. Evidence is relevant\n\nif it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. Fed.\n\n\n\n                                       - 38 -\n\fR. Evid. 401. Under Rule 403, a trial court may exclude otherwise “relevant\n\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of . . .\n\nunfair prejudice . . . .” We “afford[] the district court considerable discretion in\n\nperforming the Rule 403 balancing test because district court judges have\n\nfront-row seats during trial and extensive experience ruling on evidentiary\n\nissues.” United States v. Archuleta, 737 F.3d 1287, 1292 (10th Cir. 2013)\n\n(quoting United States v. MacKay, 715 F.3d 807, 839 (10th Cir. 2013)). We\n\nreview a district court’s evidentiary determinations for an abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Flanagan, 34 F.3d 949, 952–53 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n   Vernon filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence of his alleged\n\ngang-affiliation and any mention that the crimes were gang-related. He argued\n\nthat the evidence was irrelevant and alternatively that Rule 403 precluded\n\nadmission of the evidence. The district court denied the motion, concluding that\n\nthe gang evidence was relevant and that the probative value of the evidence\n\noutweighed the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\n   At trial, the government introduced evidence that Vernon and some of his\n\nother alleged coconspirators were members or affiliates of the Hoover Crips\n\nstreet gang. For instance, Anthony Campbell testified regarding his experience as\n\na member of the Hoover Crips from 1993 to 2003. As discussed already, this was\n\nthe government’s theory of interdependence for the global conspiracy. The Tulsa\n\n\n                                       - 39 -\n\fPolice Department has a system for “certifying” individuals as gang members or\n\naffiliates based on a point system. Officer Steven Sanders testified that Vernon\n\nhad some points, but he did not have enough to be a certified gang member; the\n\nTulsa Police Department considered him only an affiliate of the Hoover Crips.\n\nEven so, Herron testified that Vernon was an actual member of the Hoover Crips,\n\nspecifically the 27 sect. The government used the gang evidence as circumstantial\n\nevidence of interdependence between the coconspirators for all of the charged\n\nrobberies.\n\n   On appeal, Vernon makes only the bare assertion that “the government\n\npresented irrelevant, prejudicial evidence regarding the Hoover Crips street gang\n\n. . . .” Appellant’s Br. at 38. The government responds that the gang affiliation\n\nevidence was probative to establish an agreement among the defendants, the\n\npurpose of the conspiracy, and knowledge by the defendants.\n\n   We first conclude that the evidence was relevant. To prove guilt under Count\n\nOne—that Vernon had conspired with others to rob banks, credit unions, and\n\npharmacies—the government had to show that he agreed with at least one other\n\nperson to do so. See Caldwell, 589 F.3d at 1329. We have previously held that\n\n“where conspiracy is charged[,] gang-affiliation testimony may be relevant.”\n\nArchuleta, 737 F.3d at 1293–94 (citing multiple cases where this court has\n\nallowed gang-related evidence to prove conspiracy); see also, e.g., United States\n\n\n                                      - 40 -\n\fv. Brown, 200 F.3d 700, 708 (10th Cir. 1999) (same). Gang evidence is often\n\nrelevant to the formation of the conspiracy, the agreement of the coconspirators,\n\nthe purpose of the conspiracy, and the knowledge attributable to the conspirators.\n\nRobinson, 978 F.2d at 1562–63. But gang evidence alone cannot support a\n\nconviction. Id. at 1563. Here, we conclude that the gang evidence was properly\n\nadmitted because it provided circumstantial evidence that Vernon was involved in\n\nforming and agreeing to participate in the global conspiracy and knew its\n\npurpose. See id. at 1562–63.\n\n   Certainly, we concluded above that the evidence at trial established\n\ninterdependence only for the smaller conspiracies to rob the individual banks or\n\npharmacies. But we must remember that at the time of the district court’s ruling,\n\nthe district court had properly joined the alleged coconspirators’ trials, and we\n\nreview the district court’s decision based on the facts then available to it. The\n\nprobative value of the gang evidence was considerable, given that Vernon\n\ndisputed interdependence by arguing that the codefendants did not know each\n\nother and did not have a joint motive. Therefore, it was probative circumstantial\n\nevidence to disprove Vernon’s claim. See, e.g., id. at 1562 (“Circumstantial\n\nevidence is often the strongest evidence of conspiracy.”). Even for the individual\n\nconspiracies that the government actually proved at trial, this evidence had\n\nprobative value, just on a smaller scale.\n\n\n                                        - 41 -\n\f   Finally, the danger of unfair prejudice was limited, given that the\n\ngang-affiliation evidence was only a small part of the evidence against Vernon.\n\nOther direct and circumstantial evidence proved that Vernon helped commit the\n\nrobberies. For instance, Herron testified that Vernon met with others to plan the\n\nMetro Pharmacy robbery, including going into the pharmacy with two others and\n\ndemanding money and drugs. For the Arvest Bank robbery, the police discovered\n\nVernon emerging from his house shortly after the robbery. The police later found\n\nthe marked bait bills and the GPS tracker from Arvest Bank inside his house. The\n\nevidence showed that Vernon robbed Arvest Bank with two of his brothers,\n\nmeaning that the jury did not need to rely on the gang-affiliation evidence to find\n\nknowledge, purpose, or agreement among the coconspirators. In sum, Vernon’s\n\ncommon gang membership with his coconspirators was a small part of the\n\nevidence.\n\n   We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\nevidence.\n\n\n                  VII. GANG-CERTIFICATION RECORDS\n\n   Vernon further argues that the district court’s decision to admit his\n\ngang-certification record and its underlying hearsay violated the Confrontation\n\nClause. In Crawford v. Washington, the Supreme Court held that testimonial\n\n\n\n                                       - 42 -\n\fhearsay is barred from admission in a criminal trial unless the witness is\n\nunavailable and the opposing party has had an opportunity for cross-examination.\n\n541 U.S. 36, 68 (2004). This court reviews de novo the legal question of whether\n\nevidence at trial violates the Confrontation Clause. United States v. Summers, 414\n\nF.3d 1287, 1298 (10th Cir. 2005). We review a decision to admit evidence that\n\ndoes not implicate the Constitution for abuse of discretion. United States v.\n\nDowlin, 408 F.3d 647, 659 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\n   In Crawford, the Court left the definition of testimonial “for another day.” 541\n\nU.S. at 68. The court did explain:\n\n      Various formulations of this core class of “testimonial” statements\n      exist: “ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent—that\n      is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior\n      testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar\n      pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be\n      used prosecutorially,” . . . “extrajudicial statements . . . contained in\n      formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions,\n      prior testimony, or confessions” . . . “statements that were made\n      under circumstances which would lead an objective witness\n      reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at\n      a later trial,” . . . These formulations all share a common nucleus and\n      then define the Clause’s coverage at various levels of abstraction\n      around it. Regardless of the precise articulation, some statements\n      qualify under any definition—for example, ex parte testimony at a\n      preliminary hearing.\n\nId. at 51–52 (citations omitted).\n\n   Since Crawford, the Court has still not articulated a clear definition of\n\ntestimonial statements. Instead, courts have adopted an ad hoc approach for\n\n\n                                       - 43 -\n\fdetermining whether evidence is testimonial, and the Supreme Court has\n\nspecifically carved out numerous exceptions and limitations. See, e.g., Michigan\n\nv. Bryant, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 1150 (2011) (holding that statements made to police\n\nconcerning an ongoing emergency are not testimonial); Davis v. Washington, 547\n\nU.S. 813, 822 (2006) (“Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of\n\npolice interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary\n\npurpose of interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing\n\nemergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that\n\nthere is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the\n\ninterrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later\n\ncriminal prosecution.”). We have previously explained that testimonial hearsay\n\n“at a minimum, [includes] prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a\n\ngrand jury, at a former trial, and statements made during police interrogations.”\n\nUnited States v. Mendez, 514 F.3d 1035, 1043 (10th Cir. 2008) (citing Crawford,\n\n541 U.S. at 68).\n\n   Before trial, the district court found that Officer Sanders was not an expert in\n\ngang membership, but it allowed him to testify as a fact witness regarding “the\n\ngang culture within the Tulsa area, including the operation, structure and\n\nterminology of the gang, based upon his working knowledge of the same. His\n\ntestimony will, however, be governed by Fed. R. Evid. 701.” By the district\n\n\n                                      - 44 -\n\fcourt’s direction, Officer Sanders could not “give his own personal opinion as to\n\nthe gang affiliation of any particular person especially where that opinion differs\n\nfrom the official business records maintained by the Gang Task Force.” The court\n\nalso found that Officer Sanders’s personal opinions would be substantially more\n\nprejudicial than probative under Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n   At trial, Officer Sanders testified about the Tulsa Police Department’s gang-\n\ncertification system and records. He testified that the police department has a\n\ngroup called the “Tulsa Area Response Gang Enforcement Team,” also known as\n\n“TARGET.” The Tulsa Police Department keeps records to track the membership\n\nof various gangs. The gang-certification records indicate whether someone is an\n\naffiliate or a member, depending on the number of points allocated based on a\n\npredetermined scale. The records also reference other criminal investigations by\n\nthe police department. Officer Sanders, as a member of TARGET, testified that\n\nVernon’s record showed Vernon as an affiliate, not a member, of the Hoover\n\nCrips.\n\n   The district court admitted Vernon’s gang-certification record from the Tulsa\n\nPolice Department under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). On appeal, Vernon first argues\n\nthat the record did not qualify as a business record under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 45 -\n\fand that it is testimonial hearsay in violation of the Confrontation Clause. 19 He\n\nargues second that the admission of the underlying hearsay (i.e., the “points”\n\nallocated to a suspected gang member based on the Tulsa Police Department’s\n\nclassification system and the other references in the record) contained within the\n\nrecords violated the Confrontation Clause. Stated differently, Vernon argues for\n\ntwo separate Confrontation Clause violations: (1) the gang-certification record\n\nitself; and (2) the references within the record to other police reports discussing\n\nthe gang activity of Vernon. We discuss each basis for appeal separately below.\n\n\n                         A. Business Records Exception\n\n   Vernon waived his argument that the gang-certification record was not\n\nadmissible as an ordinary business record. At trial, Vernon conceded that the\n\nrecord was an ordinary business record that the police kept, and he did not object\n\nto its admission on grounds that it did not qualify for admission under the\n\nbusiness records exception. At trial, Vernon’s attorney conceded that “[t]he\n   19\n      Vernon also argues to us that the actual gang-certification records were\n“irrelevant pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 401–404, given that there was no proof the\nsupposed global conspiracy involved the Hoover Crips gang.” Appellant’s Br. at\n42. Earlier in Section VI, we concluded that the gang-affiliation evidence was\nrelevant and probative under Rules 401 and 403. For the same reasons we\naffirmed the district court in Section VI, we affirm the district court here under\nRules 401 and 403. As such, at this juncture, we are considering only whether the\ngang-certification records that the Tulsa Police Department maintained were\nincorrectly admitted into evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) and the\nConfrontation Clause.\n\n                                       - 46 -\n\fdocument itself is an ordinary business record that’s kept by the gang task force.”\n\nR. vol. 3, at 1827. Accordingly, to the extent that Vernon now argues that these\n\ndid not qualify under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), we deem that argument waived.\n\n   Vernon responds that his admissions to the district court “did not invite any\n\nerror or waive the hearsay objection” because “[s]trictly speaking, the Gang\n\nCertification records are a type of business record.” Appellant’s Reply Br. at 23.\n\nThis argument is unpersuasive. This case differs from those in which a defendant\n\ngenerally objects on hearsay grounds and later appeals. At the district court,\n\nVernon agreed with the government that the gang-certification record was a\n\nbusiness record. The closest Vernon came to objecting to admission of the gang-\n\ncertification record was when he objected that the gang points allocated to\n\nVernon violated the Confrontation Clause. See R. vol. 3, at 1828 (“The points\n\nthat are attributed by those field interviews are also hearsay and violate[] the\n\nconfrontation clause.”).\n\n   Further, Vernon did not ask for plain error review. We have held that an\n\nappellant waives an argument if he or she fails to raise it in the district court and\n\nlater on appeal fails to argue for plain error. See, e.g., United States v. Burke, 633\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 47 -\n\fF.3d 984, 987–91 (10th Cir. 2011). We therefore do not consider the merits of\n\nVernon’s Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) argument. 20\n\n\n                           B. The Confrontation Clause\n\n   Because Vernon objected generally on Confrontation Clause grounds, we will\n\nconsider whether the admission of the gang-certification record and its underlying\n\nhearsay violated Vernon’s Confrontation Clause rights. 21 Two levels of hearsay\n\nare at play: (1) the gang-certification record itself; and (2) the hearsay statements\n\nwithin the gang-certification record. Vernon argues only that “[t]he records go to\n\na key element of the government’s proof. Admitting the records was harmful and\n\nprejudicial as a matter of law.”\n\n\n   20\n      But even if we did consider the merits, any error would be harmless because\nthis evidence was cumulative in light of Herron’s testimony that Vernon was a\nmember of the Hoover Crips. We explain this more in depth below.\n   21\n      Vernon did object to the admission of the gang-certification records on the\nground that they contained a second level of inadmissible hearsay in violation of\nthe Confrontation Clause, specifically the gang-points allocated and the\nreferences to other police reports. R. vol. 3, at 1827–28 (“And under the\nconfrontation clause, those officers that have produced those documents aren’t\nhere to be cross-examined, it’s completely subjective as to what they saw, what\nthey experienced. That goes into a report that is then referenced by this gang\nsheet and that’s how the points are attributed. The document itself is a business\nrecord; however, the field interviews and the reports that are referenced within\nthere are hearsay. The points that are attributed by those filed interviews are also\nhearsay and violates the confrontation clause.”). The government admits that the\ninformation underlying the gang-certification records was inadmissible and that\nthe admission of that evidence violated the Confrontation Clause.\n\n                                       - 48 -\n\f   The admission of evidence in violation of the Confrontation Clause does not\n\nautomatically cause prejudice that requires reversal. See, e.g., Summers, 414 F.3d\n\nat 1303 (concluding that substantial evidence of guilt renders a Crawford\n\nviolation harmless beyond a reasonable doubt). Instead, we must consider\n\n(1) whether the challenged evidence is hearsay, (2) whether it is testimonial, and\n\nif so, (3) whether its introduction was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited States v. Chavez, 481 F.3d 1274, 1277 (10th Cir. 2007) (“Violations of the\n\nConfrontation Clause are subject to harmless error analysis . . . under which ‘the\n\nbeneficiary of a constitutional error must prove beyond a reasonable doubt [that]\n\nthe error complained of did not contribute to the guilty verdict.’”) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Burson, 952 F.2d 1196, 1201 (10th Cir. 1991)); Mendez, 514\n\nF.3d at 1043.\n\n      In assessing harmless error, we look to “the context in which the\n      statement was admitted, how it was used at trial, and how it\n      compares to the properly admitted evidence.” Several factors are\n      helpful in determining whether a Confrontation Clause violation\n      amounts to harmless error, among them (1) the importance of the\n      witness's testimony in the prosecution's case, (2) the cumulative\n      nature of the testimony, (3) the presence or absence of corroborating\n      or contradictory testimony, (4) the extent of cross-examination\n      otherwise permitted, and (5) the overall strength of the prosecution's\n      case.\n\nChavez, 481 F.3d at 1277 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 49 -\n\f   First, we assume, without deciding, that the gang-certification record itself\n\nwas testimonial hearsay. Second, we also assume, without deciding, that the\n\nunderlying hearsay statements in the gang-certification record were testimonial.\n\nThe government conceded as much for the underlying hearsay statements.\n\nAppellee Br. at 66 (“Vernon’s gang certification record contained three\n\nreferences to field interview reports, all of which appear to have been offered for\n\ntheir truth, and were likely to fall into this Court’s definition of testimonial\n\nhearsay. . . . [T]he information underlying those records was arguably\n\ninadmissible hearsay and violated the Confrontation Clause. However, any error\n\nin admitting the information underlying Vernon’s gang certification was harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.”). This leaves us to decide whether introduction of\n\nthe gang-certification record and the hearsay within it was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. See Chavez, 481 F.3d at 1277; see also United States v. Torrez-\n\nOrtega, 184 F.3d 1128, 1135 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n   First, the gang-certification record itself was cumulative. See Chavez, 481\n\nF.3d at 1277 (reasoning that the cumulative nature and presence of corroborating\n\ntestimony both weigh in favor of concluding that the error did not affect the\n\nguilty verdict). Even if the district court erred in admitting the gang-certification\n\nrecord itself, other admissible evidence in the record established Vernon’s gang\n\naffiliation for the jury. See id. at 1278. As a fellow member of the gang, Herron\n\n\n                                       - 50 -\n\ftestified that Vernon was a member of a particular sect of the Hoover Crips in\n\nTulsa. Thus, any error in admitting the gang-certification record was harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n   Second, the hearsay contained within the gang-certification records was a\n\nsmall part of the government’s evidence. The certification record contained three\n\nhearsay statements from field interview reports where the police noted that\n\nofficers had seen Vernon with other members of the Hoover Crips. This record\n\nalso allocated points to Vernon based on the police’s determination of Vernon’s\n\npurported gang activity. Finally, the report recommended that Vernon be\n\nconsidered a gang affiliate. Given the breadth and depth of the admissible\n\nevidence introduced against Vernon, we do not believe that the underlying\n\nhearsay contained within the gang-certification record affected the jury’s verdict.\n\nInstead, considering the totality of evidence against Vernon, we conclude that it\n\nwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n   We accordingly affirm the district court in part and conclude that any error\n\nhere was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n                        VIII. CELL PHONE RECORDS\n\n   Vernon next appeals the district court’s decision to admit cell phone records\n\nand police testimony interpreting those records. We review evidentiary\n\n\n\n                                       - 51 -\n\fdeterminations for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Blechman, 657 F.3d\n\n1052, 1063 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n   At trial, the government introduced cell phone tower evidence under the\n\nbusiness records exception to the hearsay rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). Matthew\n\nKase, who provides legal compliance services to Cricket Communication,\n\ntestified at trial and authenticated various phone records. He authenticated\n\nrecords for cell phones belonging to Whitney Landrum, Stanley’s girlfriend, for\n\nNovember 4 through November 6, 2011. He also testified about cell phone\n\nrecords for a number subscribed in Vernon’s name. He testified about Vernon’s\n\nphone’s activity from August 12 through August 14, 2011; September 3 through\n\nSeptember 5, 2011; September 8 through September 17, 2011; and November 4\n\nthrough November 6, 2011. 22 Kase also testified about records for Duncan\n\nHerron’s cell phone number for those same periods. Kase further testified about a\n\ncell phone number belonging to Lewis, which included activity for July 26\n\nthrough 27, 2011; August 12 through August 14, 2011; September 3 through\n\nSeptember 5, 2011; September 8 through September 17, 2011; November 4\n\n\n\n\n   22\n     These periods generally corresponded with the Metro Pharmacy robbery and\nthe Arvest Bank robbery.\n\n\n\n                                      - 52 -\n\fthrough November 6, 2011; and December 7 through December 11, 2011.23 In\n\nresponse to a police subpoena, Kase produced all of these records to the police as\n\npart of their investigation. Vernon objected at trial that the records were\n\ntestimonial hearsay, but the district court disagreed and admitted the cell phone\n\nrecords. 24\n\n   For each relevant phone number, Special Agent Andy Kerstetter obtained the\n\n“historical call detail records” for that number. 25 According to Agent Kerstetter,\n\nthose cell phone records identify the number of the calling phone (i.e., incoming\n\nor outgoing), the date and time of the call, and the cell tower and cell tower\n\n   23\n       These periods generally corresponded with the Metro Pharmacy robbery, the\nTulsa Credit Union robbery, and the Arvest Bank robbery.\n    24\n       Vernon argues that the cell phone tower records (which included the phone\nnumbers called, the time of the call, and the cell tower used to place the call)\nwere testimonial, but he admits that he only makes the argument to preserve this\nissue for further appeal. This court has previously held that cell phone tower data\nis admissible under the business records exception and that it is nontestimonial.\nUnited States v. Yeley-Davis, 632 F.3d 673, 678–81 (10th Cir. 2011). Because\nVernon has only raised this argument to preserve the issue and makes no effort to\nargue the merits, we do not reconsider the issues that we already addressed in\nYeley-Davis.\n\n    25 Vernon claims that Agent Kerstetter could not testify regarding these\nmatters as a fact witness because he lacked personal knowledge. Vernon does not\ncite to any point in the record where he raised this argument to the district court,\nand we will not do an exhaustive search of the record to identify whether Vernon\nproperly preserved this argument. He merely points us to the point in the record\nwhere the district court allowed Agent Kerstetter to testify as a fact witness. Even\nif Vernon properly preserved this argument, it would be unavailing because\nAgent Kerstetter properly relied on these cell phone records during the course of\nhis investigation.\n\n                                       - 53 -\n\fsector used. For each of the phone numbers, including Vernon’s, Agent Kerstetter\n\nexamined the relevant data. He turned this data into a map that depicted the\n\ninformation collected from the cell phone company.\n\n   During a Daubert hearing, the district court concluded that Agent Kerstetter\n\ncould not testify as an expert regarding the cell phone data, but that he could\n\ntestify as a fact witness about certain findings of his investigation. For instance,\n\nthe court allowed Agent Kerstetter to present diagrams he had created, depicting\n\nthe locations of the cell towers and sectors listed in the cell phone records and the\n\nlocations of the charged robberies. In those diagrams, he chose a relevant\n\ntimeframe (such as during a robbery), listed a particular phone number, and\n\nshowed aerial views of each individual location based on the sectors and towers\n\nin use. The district court disallowed Agent Kerstetter from providing any opinion\n\nabout the range of cell towers, the exact location of any particular phone, and\n\nwho was using the phones at the dates and times listed.\n\n   Vernon argues that the district court impermissibly allowed Agent Kerstetter\n\nto testify about where certain of the Defendants’ phones were located when\n\ncertain calls were placed. 26 Based on our reading of the record, the district court\n\n\n\n   26\n      Vernon also argues that the court did not allow complete cross-examination\nof Agent Kerstetter, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. He points to no place\nin the record where he preserved this argument and does not ask for plain error on\n\n                                       - 54 -\n\fallowed Agent Kerstetter to testify only about what tower was in use for a\n\nparticular call, and he was prohibited from opining about the exact location of a\n\nparticular phone.\n\n   Because Agent Kerstetter testified only about the facts contained within these\n\nrecords, we conclude that his testimony did not run afoul of Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\nWe also conclude that his use of diagrams and maps was appropriate under Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 1006. Under Rule 1006, witnesses “may use a summary, chart, or\n\ncalculation to prove the content of voluminous writings, recordings, or\n\nphotographs . . . .” See also, e.g., United States v. Samaniego, 187 F.3d 1222,\n\n1223–24 (10th Cir. 1999) (requiring admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) of\n\ntelephone records before admitting summary charts of the records under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 1006). 27\n\n   Unlike with Agent Kerstetter, the district court allowed Special Agent Charlie\n\nJones to testify about the location of phones at given times based on the same cell\n\n\nappeal. As such, we do not consider the merits of this argument. See Burke, 633\nF.3d at 987–91.\n   27\n      Vernon argues that only an expert could create these maps and diagrams.\nVernon submits that the “arcs and angles” represented a judgment call and an\nexpert opinion regarding the coverage of each tower. We disagree. After\nreviewing the maps, we conclude that they were proper summary diagrams from\nthe cell phone records available to Agent Kerstetter. The government cites to\nmultiple places in the record where Agent Kerstetter explained that the coverage\nareas were “angled at whatever angle is depicted by [the cell phone company] as\nthe cellular provider’s tower location and angle of that sector.”\n\n                                       - 55 -\n\fphone records. Agent Jones provided his opinion as to where a particular cell\n\nphone was located, sometimes even down to the particular street. Vernon argues\n\nthat Agent Jones’s testimony regarding the street location of particular cell\n\nphones was expert testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 702 and that because Agent\n\nJones was not qualified as an expert, it was improper opinion testimony. The\n\ngovernment responds that Vernon failed to object properly to Agent Jones’s\n\ntestimony at trial, and it argues for plain error review. We conclude that Vernon\n\nobjected when Agent Jones offered an opinion regarding the cell phone locations,\n\nand as such, he properly preserved this issue.\n\n   Because the government makes no effort to argue that Agent Jones’s testimony\n\nwas not improper expert testimony, we will assume, without deciding, that the\n\ndistrict court should not have permitted him to testify as he did. The government\n\nargues only that any error was harmless. “A non-constitutional error is harmless\n\nunless it had a ‘substantial influence’ on the outcome or leaves one in ‘grave\n\ndoubt’ as to whether it had such effect.” United States v. Rivera, 900 F.2d 1462,\n\n1469 (10th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (quoting Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 765). We do not\n\nthink that Agent Jones’s testimony regarding the location of the cell phones had a\n\nsubstantial influence on the outcome of the jury’s verdicts against Vernon.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 56 -\n\f   The trial record reveals abundant evidence establishing Vernon’s guilt on each\n\ncharge. 28 Vernon even admits that “[t]he government used the phone records to\n\ncorroborate Duncan Herron’s account of the Metro Pharmacy robbery,”\n\nAppellant’s Reply Br. at 21, which makes any inadmissible evidence cumulative\n\nbecause the jury had already heard similar evidence. Further, the district court\n\nproperly admitted some of the cell phone data, including Agent Kerstetter’s\n\ntestimony regarding the numbers called and the cell phone towers used to place\n\nthose calls, making some of Agent Jones’s testimony cumulative.\n\n   The jury heard admissible evidence establishing that Devers’s phone had\n\ncalled the Metro Pharmacy twice before the robbery, that Devers’s phone and\n\nHerron’s phone had communicated by text message during the robbery, and that\n\nLewis’s phone and Vernon’s phone had contacted each other by cell phone during\n\nthe robbery. All of this evidence was relevant and admissible. Herron also\n\ntestified extensively about Vernon’s involvement in planning and executing the\n\nMetro Pharmacy robbery. Also, based on the dates and times from the cell phone\n\nrecords during the Arvest Bank robbery (not the location of the phones), the jury\n\ncould infer that Vernon and Stanley were communicating before the Arvest Bank\n\nrobbery. The jury also heard the police testify that they followed the GPS tracker,\n\n   28\n     The government did not rely on cell phone evidence to prove the IBC Bank\nrobbery. The government did use cell phone evidence for the Metro Pharmacy\nrobbery and the Arvest Bank robbery.\n\n                                       - 57 -\n\fwhich led them to Vernon, who had in his home the stolen money from the\n\nrobbery, the GPS tracker, and one set of the clothes used in the robbery. In light\n\nof all of this evidence, the cell phone evidence’s importance is minimal for\n\nVernon’s convictions.\n\n   We affirm the district court in part and conclude that any error from Agent\n\nJones’s testimony was harmless.\n\n\n                      IX. EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATIONS\n\n   Vernon appeals the district court’s decision to allow the government to\n\nintroduce eyewitness-identification testimony from the IBC Bank robbery. On the\n\nday of the IBC Bank robbery, Ms. DeLeon was working as a teller. A person\n\nentered the bank and engaged her with two minutes of face-to-face small talk. He\n\nthen told her that he had a gun and demanded money. She gave him money from\n\nher teller drawer. The robber saw another teller counting money and demanded\n\nthat money as well.\n\n   Two years later, a police officer showed Ms. DeLeon a bank security\n\nphotograph, which showed the robber standing at her teller window. Not\n\nsurprisingly, she confirmed that the picture showed the suspect as she\n\nremembered him from the day of the robbery. After putting the photograph from\n\nthe robbery away, the officer then showed Ms. DeLeon a six-person photo-lineup.\n\n\n\n                                      - 58 -\n\fEven after he told her that the suspect was not necessarily included in the lineup,\n\nshe identified Vernon by circling his picture. At trial, Ms. DeLeon identified\n\nVernon in-person as the robber she had encountered at IBC Bank. During the\n\ntrial, two other witnesses from IBC Bank also identified Vernon in-person as the\n\nrobber.\n\n   Before trial, Vernon filed a motion in limine to exclude all eyewitness-\n\nidentifications of Vernon from the IBC Bank robbery. Over Vernon’s objections,\n\nthe court admitted the results of the photo lineup and Ms. DeLeon’s eyewitness\n\nidentifications. He argues to us that the identification procedure was\n\nunnecessarily suggestive and that the district court should have excluded the\n\nphoto-identification.\n\n   Vernon also argues that the photo-lineup identification “violated F.R.E. 401–\n\n03.” He asserts that “[i]t is of very limited relevance that Ms. DeLeon thinks that\n\nout of six photographed persons selected by the government, Vernon Hill looks\n\nthe most like the person who is shown in the photo from the robbery itself. Ms.\n\nDeLeon’s testimony also served to invade the province of the jury, [telling] the\n\njury what factual finding to make.” Appellant’s Br. at 52.\n\n   We identify three distinct arguments from Vernon’s appeal on this issue:\n\n(1) the photo-lineup identification was irrelevant because Ms. DeLeon was only\n\nidentifying the person from the photo lineup who best matched the photo from the\n\n\n                                       - 59 -\n\fday of the robbery; (2) the photo-lineup identification invaded the province of the\n\njury; and (3) the procedure used to obtain the photo-lineup identification was\n\nunnecessarily suggestive. We find each unpersuasive.\n\n   First, the photo-lineup identification was relevant. We review questions under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 401 for an abuse of discretion. Flanagan, 34 F.3d at 952–53. Under\n\nRule 401, something is relevant “if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more\n\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of\n\nconsequence in determining the action.” Ms. DeLeon’s identification makes it\n\nmore probable that Vernon robbed the IBC Bank than it would be without her\n\nidentification. Ms. DeLeon was working the day of the robbery, and she\n\ninteracted with Vernon before and during the robbery. Her identification of\n\nVernon is relevant because that evidence makes it more likely that Vernon was\n\nindeed the bank robber. Whether Ms. DeLeon’s identification from the photo\n\narray is a good identification goes to weight rather than admissibility. Ms.\n\nDeLeon’s eyewitness identification in the photo array satisfies Rule 401.\n\n   Also, the probative value of this identification was not substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403. We review a\n\ndistrict court’s admission of evidence under Rule 403 for an abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Cerno, 529 F.3d 926, 935 (10th Cir. 2008). “In engaging in the\n\nrequisite balancing, we ‘give the evidence its maximum reasonable probative\n\n\n                                       - 60 -\n\fforce and its minimum reasonable prejudicial value.’” Id. (quoting Deters v.\n\nEquifax Credit Info. Servs., Inc., 202 F.3d 1262, 1274 (10th Cir. 2000)). To tip\n\nagainst admitting the evidence, the risk of unfair prejudice must substantially\n\noutweigh the evidence’s probative value. Id. (citing United States v. Tan, 254\n\nF.3d 1204, 1212 (10th Cir. 2001), and SEC v. Peters, 978 F.2d 1162, 1171 (10th\n\nCir. 1992)).\n\n   We start with the probative value. Police showed Ms. DeLeon a photo taken in\n\nthe IBC Bank on the day of the robbery and asked whether the person in the\n\npicture at her teller window was the person she remembered robbing the bank. 29\n\nThis identification occurred nearly two years after the robbery. After looking at\n\nthe picture, she confirmed that the man in the photograph was the robber. Almost\n\nimmediately after this, she identified Vernon as the robber from a six-person\n\nphoto array. 30 Vernon’s only argument for unfair prejudice is that “[i]t is of very\n\nlimited relevance” whether Ms. DeLeon thinks the person from the photograph of\n\nthe robbery is in the photo array. Yet this is not unfair prejudice: whether Ms.\n\nDeLeon’s identification from the photo array is a good identification goes to\n\nweight rather than admissibility, and the weight of her identification is not at\n\n\n\n   29\n        This photo was given to the jury.\n   30\n        The photo-array was provided to the jury.\n\n                                            - 61 -\n\fissue here. We conclude that the district court properly admitted her identification\n\nof Vernon under Rule 403.\n\n   Second, the identification does not invade the province of the jury. Ms.\n\nDeLeon made her identification, and the jury was free to look at the photo array\n\nand discredit her testimony. Again, this goes to weight rather than admissibility.\n\nWe conclude that this did not invade the province of the jury.\n\n   Third, Vernon argues that the district court violated his due process rights\n\nwhen it admitted the photo-array identification from Ms. DeLeon. The\n\ngovernment argues that the process was not unnecessarily suggestive, that the\n\nidentification was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, and\n\nalternatively, that any error was harmless.\n\n   “[D]ue process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an\n\nidentification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary. . . . Even when\n\nthe police use such a procedure, . . . suppression of the resulting identification is\n\nnot the inevitable consequence.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 132 S. Ct. 716, 718\n\n(2012) (internal citations omitted); see also Grubbs v. Hannigan, 982 F.2d 1483,\n\n1489–90 (10th Cir. 1993). “[W]e then examine whether under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances the identification was reliable even though the confrontation\n\nprocedure was suggestive.” United States v. Bredy, 209 F.3d 1193, 1195 (10th\n\nCir. 2000) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188,\n\n\n                                       - 62 -\n\f199 (1972)). If a reviewing court concludes that the identification procedure was\n\nunnecessarily suggestive and that the identification was not reliable under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, it evaluates the erroneous admission under harmless\n\nerror. See, e.g., Biggers v. Tennessee, 390 U.S. 404, 408–09 (1968). This is a\n\nmixed question of law and fact that we review de novo. Archuleta v. Kerby, 864\n\nF.2d 709, 710–11 (10th Cir. 1989).\n\n   We conclude that the photo array shown to Ms. DeLeon was not unnecessarily\n\nsuggestive. First, contrary to Vernon’s argument that the individuals depicted do\n\nnot look alike, we conclude that the suspects in the photo array are sufficiently\n\nsimilar. Second, the officer did not show Ms. DeLeon a picture of the suspect and\n\ntell her to match it to the photo array, although the two identifications occurred\n\nwithin minutes of each other. Instead, he asked her if the man in the photograph\n\nfrom the robbery was the one she remembered coming into the bank. She said he\n\nwas. She then selected Vernon from the photo array. Even further, the\n\nidentification has other indicia of reliability. During the robbery, Ms. DeLeon\n\ninteracted with the robber for two minutes, in a friendly manner, before he\n\nattempted to rob the bank.\n\n   Finally, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Ms. DeLeon\n\nidentified Vernon in court, based off her interactions with him during the\n\nrobbery. Any problem with the photo-array lineup is not so severe as to taint this\n\n\n                                      - 63 -\n\fin-court identification. And importantly, two other eyewitnesses from the IBC\n\nBank robbery identified Vernon at trial as the robber. Vernon does not challenge\n\nthese identifications on appeal. The in-court identifications are enough to ensure\n\nthat any error with Ms. DeLeon’s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n   We affirm the district court.\n\n\n                           X. CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n   Lastly, Vernon argues that he is entitled to a new trial because of cumulative\n\nerror. Cumulative-error analysis aggregates all actual errors and analyzes whether\n\nthe cumulative effect on the outcome of the trial was such that the defendant’s\n\nsubstantial rights were affected. Rivera, 900 F.2d at 1470; see also United States\n\nv. Toles, 297 F.3d 959, 972 (10th Cir. 2002). Only actual errors are considered.\n\nRivera, 900 F.2d at 1470. Errors are only those violations “of an established legal\n\nstandard defining a particular error,” not just incidents a reviewing court\n\nconsiders troubling. Id. at 1471. There must be at least two errors. Id. at 1469. If\n\nany of the errors aggregated are constitutional in nature, the cumulative error\n\nmust be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in order to affirm. Toles, 297 F.3d at\n\n972.\n\n   This is a difficult inquiry, and we have explained:\n\n\n\n                                       - 64 -\n\f        [T]he constitutional guarantee of a fundamentally fair trial cannot be\n        defined with reference to particularized legal elements, which would\n        limit the discretion of courts to determine whether a trial was\n        fundamentally unfair. Precisely because a fundamental-fairness\n        analysis is not subject to clearly definable legal elements, however,\n        we must approach such analysis with considerable self-restraint.\n        “Courts should tread gingerly when faced with arguments”\n        concerning “the ‘fundamental fairness’ component of the Fifth\n        Amendment’s Due Process Clause,” which should be reserved for\n        “the most serious cases, which truly shock the conscience as well as\n        the mind.”\n\nRivera, 900 F.2d at 1477 (quoting United States v. Penn, 647 F.2d 876, 880 (9th\n\nCir. 1980) (en banc)).\n\n   There are multiple errors in this case. Because the two assumed Confrontation\n\nClause errors are constitutional in nature, the cumulative error must be harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. 31 Toles, 297 F.3d at 972. Given the extremely high\n\nbar set for cumulative error, we conclude that the errors in this case do not rise to\n\nthe level such that they “truly shock the conscience as well as the mind.” Rivera,\n\n900 F.2d at 1477 (quoting Penn, 647 F.2d at 880) (internal quotation mark\n\nomitted). Even absent the errors, there was overwhelming evidence establishing\n\nVernon’s guilt in the commission of the three robberies and in the conspiracy to\n\nrob the Metro Pharmacy and the conspiracy to rob Arvest Bank. Vernon does not\n\nsufficiently argue that his is a “most serious case[]” that “truly shock[s] the\n\n\n   31\n     We assumed, without deciding, that there was error under the Confrontation\nClause as to the gang-certification records and the underlying hearsay.\n\n                                        - 65 -\n\fconscience as well as the mind.” See id. In a long and complex trial, the district\n\ncourt erred in making some evidentiary determinations and in determining that\n\nthe evidence at trial did support the government’s allegation that there was a\n\nglobal conspiracy to rob banks, credit unions, and pharmacies throughout Tulsa.\n\nYet these errors together do not rise to the level of a due process violation. We\n\nconclude that there is not cumulative error.\n\n\n                               XI. CONCLUSION\n\n   We affirm Vernon’s convictions as to all counts.\n\n\n                                      ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                      Gregory A. Phillips\n                                      Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 66 -\n\fNo. 13-5084, United States v Veronon Hill\n\nMcHUGH, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I am pleased to join in the majority’s well-reasoned Order and Judgment affirming\n\nVernon’s convictions. I write separately to explain why I conclude the variance in this\n\ncase did not prejudice Vernon’s right to a fair trial. As I described in my concurring and\n\ndissenting opinion in United States v. [Dejuan] Hill, __ F.3d __, No. 13-5074 (10th Cir.\n\nMay 22, 2015) (McHugh, J. concurring and dissenting), the government’s decision to\n\ncharge and try the defendants for participating in a global conspiracy for which there was\n\ninsufficient evidence carried with it the risk of prejudicial spillover. But in Vernon’s case,\n\nthe variance did not cause substantial prejudice. The government alleged Vernon\n\nparticipated in four of the seven robberies (specifically, the IBC Bank, CVS Pharmacy\n\n(uncharged), Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest Bank). As the majority explains, much of the\n\ngang evidence admitted was directly relevant to Vernon’s involvement in the conspiracy\n\nto rob the Metro Pharmacy. And even if the global conspiracy theory allowed the\n\ngovernment to offer some irrelevant and potentially inflammatory evidence related to the\n\nHoover Crips gang or other robberies in which Vernon played no role, the compelling\n\nevidence of Vernon’s guilt with respect to the Metro Pharmacy and Arvest Bank\n\nrobberies makes it unlikely the admission of this evidence improperly influenced the\n\njury’s verdict. Therefore, I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the variance did not\n\ninterfere with Vernon’s right to a fair trial.\n\n       I join all other parts of the majority’s Order and Judgment in full.\n\f",

It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.\n     1\n     Throughout this opinion, we will refer to Vernon Hill, Dejuan Hill, Stanley\nHill, Deandre Hopkins, and Kenneth Hopkins by their first names because there\nwere other coconspirators indicted with the same last names.\n\fsevering his trial from his codefendants’ trials; 2 (4) not concluding there was a\n\nfatal variance between the charged conspiracy and the individual conspiracies\n\nunderlying separate robberies; (5) admitting evidence of the robberies charged\n\nagainst his codefendants as well as evidence of the uncharged CVS Pharmacy\n\nrobbery; (6) admitting gang-affiliation evidence; (7) admitting gang-certification\n\nrecords; (8) admitting the underlying hearsay statements contained within the\n\ngang-certification records; (9) admitting cell phone tower records; (10) admitting\n\nlay testimony from police officers about cell phone records; and (11) admitting an\n\neyewitness identification in violation of due process. Vernon also argues that\n\ncumulative error requires that we vacate his conviction.\n\n   Exercising jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(1) and 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we\n\naffirm Vernon’s convictions for the reasons set forth below.\n\n\n                  I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n   While investigating a series of robberies in Tulsa, the local police began to\n\nsuspect that the robberies were connected. The police developed a list of\n\nsuspects, which included Vernon. Other suspects included Dontayne Tiger,\n\n\n\n\n   2\n    Of the eight men charged with the conspiracy, just three—Vernon, Dejuan,\nand Deandre—were tried together, the remaining five having pleaded guilty\nbefore trial.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fDeandre Hopkins, 3 James Miller, Christopher Lewis, Marquis Devers, Duncan\n\nHerron, and Kenneth Hopkins. Initially, police did not suspect Dejuan Hill, but a\n\ngrand jury ultimately indicted him as a coconspirator. 4 Officer Maxwell Ryden\n\ninterviewed Herron, who believed that police would eventually charge him and\n\nagreed to cooperate in the investigation.\n\n   This appeal involves seven robberies that took place between August 2009 to\n\nNovember 2011: (1) IBC Bank; (2) Dooley’s Pharmacy; (3) Barnes Pharmacy;\n\n(4) Metro Pharmacy and Medical Supplies (“Metro Pharmacy”); (5) CVS\n\nPharmacy; (6) Tulsa Municipal Employees Federal Credit Union (“Tulsa Credit\n\nUnion”); and (7) Arvest Bank. The indictment charged that Vernon had\n\nparticipated directly in the robberies of IBC Bank, Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest\n\nBank.\n\n   A federal grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against eight men,\n\ncharging that they had conspired to commit six of the seven robberies, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). 5 The indictment listed 26 overt acts committed\n\n\n   3\n    Deandre appeals his conviction in a related appeal. United States v. Hopkins,\nNo. 13-5072 (10th Cir. May 22, 2015) (unpublished).\n   4\n    Dejuan appeals his conviction in a related appeal. United States v. Hill, No.\n13-5074 (10th Cir. May 22, 2015).\n   5\n     The indictment named eight defendants: Vernon, Lewis, Deandre, Devers,\nTiger, Miller, Kenneth, and Dejuan.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fin furtherance of the conspiracy, as well as describing the manner and means of\n\nthe conspiracy. Vernon filed multiple pretrial motions. Everyone charged in the\n\nindictment pleaded guilty except for Vernon, Dejuan, and Deandre. At their joint\n\ntrial, the government introduced evidence as set forth below.\n\n\n                                  A. IBC Bank\n\n   In August 2009, a man wearing sunglasses but no mask robbed IBC Bank in\n\nTulsa. 6 At the counter, he spoke with the teller for a few minutes and then\n\ndemanded money. He told her that he had a gun. The robber left alone on foot.\n\n   Tulsa Police Officer John Brown investigated this robbery. Officer Brown\n\nshowed Officer Amilee Floyd a bank photograph of the robber standing at the\n\nteller window. Officer Floyd thought that the person in the photograph was\n\nVernon (Officer Floyd and Vernon had attended high school together). Officer\n\nBrown obtained a picture of Vernon, and he showed it to a few witnesses present\n\nat the robbery, but no one could identify him as the robber. Officer Brown then\n\n\n\n   6\n     Before the trial in this case, a state court jury acquitted Vernon of robbing\nIBC Bank. The federal jury in this case, however, returned a guilty verdict on\nCount Two, which charged Vernon with robbing IBC Bank. Count One listed\nVernon’s robbery of IBC Bank as an overt act done in furtherance of the\nconspiracy. But we conclude that the government introduced insufficient\nevidence to tie the IBC Bank robbery to any conspiracy. This conclusion does not\naffect Vernon’s conviction on Count Two for the actual robbery of IBC Bank.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fshowed the photograph from the robbery to the teller Vernon robbed, Ms.\n\nDeLeon, and she identified the man in the photograph as the bank robber. He then\n\nshowed her a photo array of six similar looking men, and she positively identified\n\nVernon as the bank robber.\n\n   At trial, Ms. DeLeon again identified Vernon as the robber. Two other\n\nwitnesses from the bank robbery also testified that Vernon was the bank robber.\n\nNeither of these two witnesses had been able to identify Vernon from the\n\nphotograph before the trial.\n\n\n                               B. Metro Pharmacy\n\n   This robbery occurred in August 2011. Herron testified at trial that he\n\nparticipated in the Metro Pharmacy robbery and described the involvement of\n\nVernon, Lewis, Devers, Tiger, and Deandre. Herron admitted to meeting with\n\nthese men to plan the Metro Pharmacy robbery. Later that day, they executed\n\ntheir plan. Herron walked into the pharmacy to buy some medicine, texted Devers\n\nas he was leaving, and held the door open for Vernon, Lewis, and Devers\n\n(because customers had to be buzzed into the pharmacy). Once inside, those three\n\nmen robbed the pharmacy, and two of the robbers brandished guns, with the third\n\nrobber (Vernon) carrying a bag. Herron testified that both Tiger and Deandre\n\nacted as lookouts during the robbery. After the robbery, the men, except Herron,\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fgot into a van parked outside of the pharmacy and drove away. As Tiger\n\ninstructed, Herron called 911 to report the robbery after they had left, attempting\n\nto divert the police’s attention from his involvement.\n\n   At trial, the government admitted cell phone records establishing that Devers’s\n\nphone had called the Metro Pharmacy twice before the robbery, that Devers’s\n\nphone and Herron’s phone had communicated by text message during the\n\nrobbery, and that Lewis’s phone and Vernon’s phone had contacted each other by\n\ncell phone during the robbery.\n\n\n                                  C. Arvest Bank\n\n   This robbery occurred in November 2011, and before the trial in this case, a\n\nfederal jury had already convicted Vernon of committing it. 7 We affirmed his\n\nconviction on appeal. United States v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689 (10th Cir. 2013). In\n\nthe present case, the government charged Vernon with having also conspired to\n\ncommit this offense. 8\n\n\n\n   7\n     This robbery is discussed in depth in United States v. Hill, ___ F.3d ___\n(10th Cir. 2015), our decision affirming the conviction of Dejuan, who robbed\nArvest Bank with Vernon.\n   8\n    To clarify, the Supreme Court has held that a substantive crime and a\nconspiracy to commit that crime are not the same offense for double jeopardy\npurposes. United States v. Felix, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112713\"><a href=\"/opinion/112713/united-states-v-felix/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391–92 (1992).\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f   Two armed, masked men robbed Arvest Bank. Amidst the money the tellers\n\ngave the bank robbers were previously concealed marked $50 bait bills and a\n\nstrap of $20 bills containing a GPS tracker. When bank employees pull the bait\n\nmoney containing the GPS tracker, this alerts the security company, and the\n\nsecurity company calls the bank to check on the situation. Upon the GPS tracker’s\n\nremoval from its magnetic plate, it sent a signal to the police, alerting them of the\n\nrobbery. After the phones began to ring, Juantonio Baldwin, a bank teller, told the\n\nrobbers that the security company was calling and that they should leave. The\n\nrobbers then left the bank.\n\n   Officers immediately began receiving location updates from the tracker. The\n\ndevice was moving “pretty fast,” so they assumed that it was traveling in an\n\nautomobile. The tracker stopped moving near 1109 East Pine Street, which was\n\nnear Vernon’s known residence at 1107 East Pine Street. The officers obtained a\n\nhand-held tracker, which allowed them to pinpoint exactly where the tracking\n\ndevice was located. They confirmed that it was inside 1107 East Pine. The\n\nofficers obtained a search warrant for the house. Before they executed the search\n\nwarrant, Vernon and Stanley Hill (Vernon’s brother) emerged from the house, and\n\nthe officers arrested them. Upon executing the search warrant, the officers found\n\nmoney stolen from the bank, the GPS tracker, a Glock pistol, a hooded black\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsweatshirt, a ski mask, gloves, and dark-colored pants, all of which they believed\n\nhad been used in the robbery.\n\n\n                            D. The Larger Conspiracy\n\n   The government’s theory of the case at trial was that all eight individuals\n\nindicted had conspired, generally, to commit bank, credit union, and pharmacy\n\nrobberies in Tulsa. To prove this larger conspiracy, the government relied heavily\n\non each coconspirator’s relationship with the Hoover Crips street gang. The\n\ngovernment also highlighted the perceived similarities between the robberies. At\n\ntrial, the government introduced evidence of three robberies for which Vernon\n\nwas not charged—Dooley’s Pharmacy, Barnes Pharmacy, and Tulsa Credit Union.\n\nNo direct evidence linked Vernon to any of those robberies. The government also\n\nintroduced evidence of a robbery at CVS Pharmacy, a robbery not charged in the\n\nindictment. The court admitted evidence tying Vernon to that robbery.\n\n\n                                E. Procedural History\n\n   At the conclusion of the government’s case, Vernon moved under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29 for a judgment of acquittal on Count One, the global conspiracy\n\ncharge, arguing that the government had failed to prove interdependence. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion. The jury convicted Vernon on all four charges\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fagainst him: one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, two counts of robbery,\n\nand one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.\n\n   Two weeks after the verdict, Vernon filed another motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal on Count One, this time alleging a fatal variance between his indictment\n\nand what the government ultimately proved at trial. Viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government, the district court denied the motion,\n\nconcluding that the government had presented sufficient evidence to establish the\n\nglobal conspiracy.\n\n   On appeal, Vernon raises many issues, all of which we discuss in turn below.\n\n\n                             II. THE INDICTMENT\n\n   “To pass constitutional muster, an indictment must contain all the essential\n\nelements of the charged offense.” United States v.

R. Crim. P. 14, Vernon filed a pretrial motion to sever his charged\n\noffenses into two trials and to sever his trial from the other defendants. 11 Vernon\n\nattempted to show the necessary prejudice under Rule 14 by identifying certain\n\ncoconspirator statements that, if introduced at trial, would prejudice him. Taking\n\nits cue from Rule 14(b), 12 the district court required the government to deliver to\n\n\n\n   11\n      Specifically, Vernon asked the district court to sever and try separately\nCount Two, which related to the IBC robbery. Vernon also requested the district\ncourt to sever Counts Five and Six, which involved the robbery committed by\nVernon, Lewis, Deandre, Devers, and Tiger.\n   12\n     This rule requires that “[b]efore ruling on a defendant’s motion to sever, the\ncourt may order a government attorney to deliver to the court for in camera\n\n                                       - 13 -\n\fthe court for in camera inspection any coconspirator statements it intended to use\n\nat trial. After reviewing that evidence, the district court excluded one of Vernon’s\n\ncoconspirator’s statements, concluding it was inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E) because it was not uttered during and in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy. The district court denied the severance motions. 13\n\n\n\ninspection any defendant’s statement that the government intends to use as\nevidence.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(b).\n   13\n        The court explained:\n\n        Based upon the evidence presented by the government, this court\n        finds that the government did not present independent admissible\n        evidence of a conspiracy. During said hearing numerous statements\n        were identified as having been made by one or more of the\n        defendants. According to the government’s summation of the\n        evidence, however, the only statements which the government will\n        seek to admit as co-conspirators statements were made by Defendant\n        Devers to Duncan Herron. Since the government’s evidence failed to\n        prove a conspiracy, this court finds said statements are not\n        admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).\n\nR. vol. 1, at 448. Vernon points to this statement in support of his argument that\nthe trials and charges should have been severed because the government failed to\nproperly indict or prove a conspiracy. In equating a preliminary finding of\nconspiracy enabling the government to introduce coconspirator statements under\nRule 801(d)(2)(E) with the sufficiency of a conspiracy charge in an indictment,\nVernon errs.

R. Crim.\n\nP. 8(b), asserting that the claims against Vernon had to be severed from unrelated\n\ncharges against codefendants. He confuses the issues: Rule 8 is a permissive rule\n\nthat allows courts to join defendants and charges under certain circumstances;\n\nRule 14 provides relief from prejudicial joinder. Vernon admits that if the\n\nindictment had properly alleged a global conspiracy, then the district court could\n\nproperly join the counts under Rule 8.\n\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a) governs the joinder of offenses: the indictment may\n\ncharge a defendant “with [two] or more offenses if the offenses charged . . . are\n\nof the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\n\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed.

Under Edwards,\n\nthis is insufficient to establish prejudice. See 69 F.3d at 434. While Vernon\n\nbroadly alleges prejudice, he does not point to any specific instances in his trial\n\nwhere prejudice occurred. This broad contention is insufficient. 15 See United\n\nStates v.

VARIANCE\n\n   Next, Vernon argues that the government failed to prove the global conspiracy\n\ncharged in Count One. To prove a conspiracy, the government must prove four\n\nelements: (1) that two or more people agreed to violate the law; (2) that the\n\ndefendant knew at least the conspiracy’s essential objectives; (3) that the\n\ndefendant knowingly became a part of the conspiracy; and (4) that the\n\ncoconspirators were interdependent.

When deciding whether a prejudicial guilt-\n\nspillover occurred, we consider (1) whether the separate conspiracies affected the\n\njury’s ability to evaluate each defendant’s individual actions, (2) whether the\n\nvariance caused the jury to misuse evidence, and (3) the strength of the evidence\n\nunderlying the conviction. Carnagie, 533 F.3d at 1241.\n\n   In this case, in Count One, the government charged the defendants, including\n\nVernon, with conspiring to rob banks, credit unions, and pharmacies throughout\n\nTulsa as members or affiliates of the Hoover Crips. The government listed the\n\nfollowing manner and means of the conspiracy: (1) “[T]he conspirators were and\n\nare members or affiliates with the Hoover Crips street gang”; (2) “[T]he\n\nconspirators   would   and   did   commit      robberies of   businesses,   including\n\npharmacies, banks and a credit union”; (3) “[T]he conspirators would and did use\n\nfirearms during the robberies”; (4) “[T]he conspirators would and did use cellular\n\nphones to communicate before, during and after robberies”; and (5) “[T]he\n\nconspirators would and did threaten persons who were potential witnesses to\n\nrobberies.” Count One listed 26 overt acts that various conspirators allegedly\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\ftook in furtherance of the conspiracy.

He argued that the indictment alleged a global conspiracy, but that the\n\nevidence would show only multiple, smaller conspiracies. The district court\n\ndenied this motion, but it advised Vernon that he could “reurge this motion after\n\nall of the evidence has been presented at trial.” The government’s theory at trial\n\nwas that Vernon and his coconspirators were members of the Hoover Crips, and\n\nthrough this association, they had conspired to commit multiple robberies.\n\nVernon argues that this evidence was insufficient to prove interdependence for\n\nthe global conspiracy.\n\n   We agree with Vernon that the record shows insufficient evidence that the\n\ncharged coconspirators shared a single, shared unlawful goal or purpose of\n\nrobbing banks, credit unions, and pharmacies as the indictment charged. 16 See\n\nUnited States v.

As we explained in Carnagie, “[a]\n\ncommon goal, however, is not by itself enough to establish interdependence:\n\n[w]hat is required is a shared, single criminal objective, not just similar or\n\nparallel objectives between similarly situated people.” 533 F.3d at 1239\n\n(emphasis in original) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Evans, 970 F.2d at\n\n671). Conspiring to commit one of the individual robberies, without more, does\n\nnot amount to conspiring to commit all of the robberies. Even though the general\n\nobjective between the individual robberies was the same—the robbery of banks,\n\ncredit unions, or pharmacies for drugs or money—that does not necessarily mean\n\nthat the separate groups were interdependent. See id. at 1238–40.\n\n   For the global conspiracy, the jury had to infer that because all of the\n\nconspirators were members or affiliates of the Hoover Crips, they must have had\n\na shared, criminal objective sufficient to establish interdependence. We do not\n\nthink that is enough. In United States v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594416\"><a href=\"/opinion/594416/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-deshawn-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1563 (10th Cir.\n\n1992),   we   explained   that,   while    gang-affiliation   evidence   is   probative\n\ncircumstantial evidence tending to show agreement, purpose, and knowledge for a\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 22 -\n\fconspiracy, gang-affiliation evidence “alone could not support a conviction.” 17\n\nThe defendants in Robinson stood trial for conspiring to distribute, possess, and\n\nmanufacture cocaine base. Id. at 1558. In that case, unlike here, the government\n\nadmitted evidence beyond gang membership to prove the drug conspiracy. Id. at\n\n1563. For instance, there was “uncontroverted testimony that the main purpose of\n\nthe [gang] was to sell cocaine” and “ample evidence of drug trafficking in\n\naddition   to   the   gang    related    items   discovered    at   the   apartment\n\n. . . .” Id. at 1561–63. For the conspirators in this case, we see no evidence, other\n\nthan gang membership, that shows or provides a sufficient inference of a shared\n\ncriminal goal to rob banks and pharmacies.\n\n   For instance, there was no evidence showing that the individual robbers\n\n“benefitted from or depended upon the success of the” other robbers or robberies.\n\nSee Carnagie, 533 F.3d at 1240 (citing United States v.

The conspirators’\n\naffiliations with the Hoover Crips, by itself, are not enough to establish\n\n   17\n     We note that the gang-certification evidence introduced at trial only showed\nthat Vernon was a known affiliate of the Hoover Crips, not necessarily a full-\nfledged member.\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\finterdependence. Lacking from the government’s proof was any showing that for\n\nany particular robbery, anyone but the robbers committing it benefitted in any\n\nway—that is, we see no evidence that nonparticipating gang members or affiliates\n\nshared in any stolen drugs or money. In one very real sense, each individual bank,\n\ncredit union, or pharmacy robbery harmed—not benefitted—the nonparticipating\n\nbank robbers. After each robbery, police became more alert to future related\n\nrobberies and began to see that Hoover Crips members or affiliates were\n\ninvolved.\n\n   The government argues that the commonalities between the robberies and the\n\ngang evidence should be enough. We disagree. While commonalities might be\n\nenough if the means and method were unique in some way, that simply was not\n\nthe case here. Cf., e.g., United States v. Carroll, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768098\"><a href=\"/opinion/768098/united-states-v-gerald-r-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469–70 (8th Cir.\n\n2000) (finding the means and methods used in two bank robberies too generic to\n\npermit an inference of identity under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)). The government tried\n\nto rely on the gang-affiliation evidence to link all of these facts together and paint\n\na picture of a gang-based robbery conspiracy. It also cited the discharge of\n\nfirearms and the demand of money and controlled substances during the robberies\n\nin an attempt to prove interdependence. The use of cell phones, facemasks, guns,\n\nbags, threats, and a stolen getaway car does not elevate this string of robberies\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\finto one where we can infer that the same group committed all of them. We do\n\nnot see any uniqueness in method that would support interdependence.\n\n   Therefore, we conclude that the government introduced insufficient evidence\n\nof interdependence to prove the global conspiracy as Count One charged. But this\n\ndoes not end our inquiry. In this situation, if the government showed that Vernon\n\nconspired to commit one or more of the individual robberies, we can still affirm\n\nhis conspiracy conviction under our circuit’s variance doctrine. See, e.g.,\n\nCaldwell, 589 F.3d at 1332–33. This requires us to analyze (1) whether the\n\ngovernment proved that Vernon had conspired to commit one or more of the\n\nindividual robberies, and (2) whether this discrepancy constitutes a prejudicial\n\nvariance.\n\n   In fact, Vernon concedes the first inquiry by admitting that multiple, smaller\n\nconspiracies were established: 18\n\n        At most, a juror could have inferred Vernon robbed a bank by\n        himself, agreed to participate in a conspiracy to rob the Metro (with\n        one group of people), and then engaged in a second conspiracy to rob\n        the Arvest Bank (with his brother or brothers, who were not involved\n        in the other robberies). However, no evidence links those robberies\n        to each other or to some common endeavor.\n\n   18\n      Even had Vernon not conceded this argument, we think sufficient evidence\nestablishes two individual conspiracies. We agree with Vernon that there was\ninsufficient evidence introduced at trial to establish that he conspired to rob IBC\nBank. But even excluding the IBC Bank robbery, the evidence at trial still\nshowed two narrower conspiracies—a conspiracy to rob the Metro Pharmacy and\na conspiracy to rob the Arvest Bank.\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\fAppellant’s Br. at 36. In his Reply Brief, he goes even further: “Vernon does not\n\ndispute that each robbery (excluding the IBC robbery) had more than one\n\nparticipant and was planned by its robbers, whoever they were.” Appellant’s\n\nReply Br. at 7, 9 (“At most, the evidence shows that different people on different\n\ndates and locations got together to plan unrelated robberies.”). Vernon rests his\n\nappeal on the alleged prejudice that resulted from this variance. To determine if\n\nVernon suffered prejudice, we look at whether he received adequate notice of the\n\nsmaller conspiracies and whether there was prejudicial guilt spillover.\n\n\n\n\n                 A. Did Vernon Receive Adequate Notice of the\n                     Smaller Conspiracies Actually Proven?\n\n   We conclude that the indictment adequately notified Vernon of the smaller\n\nconspiracies ultimately presented at trial. See, e.g., Caldwell, 589 F.3d at 1333\n\n(“When an indictment charges a conspiracy among multiple individuals, it\n\ngenerally provides sufficient notice to a defendant that she must defend against\n\nthe smaller conspiracies.”). The indictment fully contemplated the smaller\n\nconspiracies. Based on the indictment, Vernon knew that the government had\n\ncharged him with committing two robberies (not including his earlier conviction\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 26 -\n\ffor the Arvest Bank robbery). By reading the indictment, Vernon could fully\n\nanticipate evidence about the Hoover Crips and his conduct in committing the\n\nIBC Bank, Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest Bank robberies. This adequately notified\n\nhim of his need to defend against the smaller conspiracies ultimately proved.\n\n\n                    B. Was There Prejudicial Guilt Spillover?\n\n   Second, “[a] defendant’s substantial rights are affected in the context of a\n\nvariance when the jury determines a defendant’s guilt by relying on evidence\n\nadduced against coconspirators who were involved in separate conspiracies.”\n\nEdwards, 69 F.3d at 433. To evaluate whether a prejudicial spillover occurred,\n\nreviewing courts look to three factors: (1) whether the separate conspiracies\n\naffected the jury’s ability to evaluate each defendant’s individual actions;\n\n(2) whether the variance caused the jury to misuse evidence; and (3) the strength\n\nof the evidence underlying the conviction. Carnagie, 533 F.3d at 1241. Applying\n\nthese factors, we conclude that there was no spillover-guilt effect in this case.\n\n\n         i. Did the Separate Conspiracies Affect the Jury’s Ability to\n                Evaluate Each Defendant’s Individual Actions?\n\n   Evaluating the first Carnagie factor, we conclude that the evidence of separate\n\nconspiracies did not impair the jury’s ability to segregate each conspirator’s\n\nactions. As the Supreme Court explained in Kotteakos, the greater number of\n\n\n\n                                        - 27 -\n\fdefendants tried and conspiracies established, the more likely it is that prejudice\n\nwill result. 328 U.S. at 772–73. In that case, more than thirty people were\n\nindicted, with nineteen tried together, and at least eight separate conspiracies\n\nestablished. See id at 766.\n\n   The Court created no fixed rule based on the numbers for determining when\n\nprejudice occurs. Id. at 773–74 (expressing no opinion on what “marks the limit,”\n\nbut making clear that it exists somewhere between Berger and Kotteakos).\n\nReviewing courts must look to the facts of each case to determine whether a\n\ndefendant has suffered substantial prejudice. See generally Carnagie, 533 F.3d at\n\n1242 (holding that trying three defendants together for three separate\n\nconspiracies, given other factors, did not constitute prejudice). In this case, there\n\nwere only three defendants tried together (Vernon, Dejuan, and Deandre) and five\n\nconspiracies proven (Dooley Pharmacy, Barnes Pharmacy, Metro Pharmacy,\n\nTulsa Credit Union, and Arvest Bank). As in Carnagie, “the number of\n\ndefendants tried and conspiracies proven do not reach the magnitude of\n\nKotteakos, and thus the risk of prejudice is not as great.” Id. (citing Kotteakos,\n\n328 U.S. at 774).\n\n   In support of his argument that he suffered prejudice from evidentiary\n\nspillover, Vernon makes three arguments: (1) “the government admitted and\n\nhighlighted a great deal of evidence about crimes Vernon clearly did not\n\n\n                                       - 28 -\n\fcommit”; (2) “[t]he government also used the Global Conspiracy theory as a\n\njustification to present gang evidence at trial”; and (3) “the jury’s special\n\ninterrogatory answers in connection with the verdict against Vernon contained\n\nadverse findings about the Dooley Pharmacy, the T. Roy Barnes [Pharmacy], and\n\nTulsa Municipal Employees Credit Union robberies, absent any evidence linking\n\nVernon to those crimes.” Appellant’s Reply Br. at 16.\n\n   Vernon’s first argument is unpersuasive. There were very clear distinctions\n\nbetween the evidence that was relevant to each defendant. As in Carnagie, the\n\nevidence here was not so intricate as to render the jury unable to separate the\n\nevidence associated with each defendant’s individual actions. See 533 F.3d at\n\n1242. Moreover, the evidence from the other robberies was “of the exact same\n\ncharacter” as the evidence from the three robberies involving Vernon. See id.\n\n“We have held that such a similarity between different transactions cuts against a\n\nfinding of substantial prejudice.” Id.; cf. United States v. Bertolotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"332419\"><a href=\"/opinion/332419/united-states-v-angelo-bertolotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n157 (2d Cir. 1975) (finding a prejudicial variance based in part on the fact that\n\n“the crimes of the various appellants . . . scarcely resembled one another”).\n\n   Nor does Vernon’s second argument persuade us. As we explain below, we\n\nconclude that the district court properly admitted gang-affiliation evidence\n\nagainst Vernon under Fed. R. Evid. 403. Its probative value, even in light of the\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice, would have existed even if Vernon had stood trial for\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fconspiring to commit the three smaller robberies. The evidence still would have\n\ntended to show purpose, knowledge, and intent to commit the three robberies,\n\nespecially for the Metro Pharmacy robbery, which involved a wider, more diverse\n\ngroup of coconspirators (than the Arvest Bank robbery), who shared ties with\n\neach other through the Hoover Crips. Because we conclude that this evidence was\n\nadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 403, we also conclude that its admission does not\n\nconstitute substantial prejudice for the purpose of the variance analysis. Vernon\n\nmakes no particularized argument regarding why the gang evidence caused him\n\nsubstantial prejudice; he simply asserts that it did.\n\n   Evaluating his final argument, we fail to see what “adverse findings” the\n\njury’s special interrogatory answers contain. In our view, the special\n\ninterrogatories show that the jury understood that it could hold each defendant\n\naccountable only for the evidence introduced against him.\n\n\n           ii. Did the Variance Cause the Jury to Misuse Evidence?\n\n   Under Carnagie’s second prong, we must examine whether a variance caused\n\njuror confusion about the legal limitations on the use of certain evidence. 533\n\nF.3d at 1243. Vernon does not allege this type of prejudice. In fact, the district\n\ncourt excluded all coconspirator statements that the government had sought to\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 30 -\n\fintroduce under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). After reviewing the record, we\n\nconclude that there was no prejudice from jury confusion.\n\n\n                  iii. Was there Sufficiently Strong Evidence\n                        Underlying the Jury’s Decision?\n\n   Under Carnagie’s final prong, we must consider the strength of the evidence\n\nunderlying the jury’s conviction on Count One, the global conspiracy. To do so,\n\nwe examine the evidence supporting the “smaller, separate conspiracies.”\n\nCarnagie, 533 F.3d at 1243. As first noted earlier, we conclude that the\n\ngovernment presented sufficient evidence to prove that Vernon conspired with\n\nothers to rob Metro Pharmacy and Arvest Bank.\n\n   For the Metro Pharmacy robbery, Herron testified that Vernon had planned\n\nand participated in the robbery. Herron walked into the pharmacy to buy some\n\nmedicine, texted Devers as he was leaving, and held open the door for Vernon,\n\nLewis, and Devers because customers had to be buzzed into the pharmacy. Once\n\ninside, those three men robbed the pharmacy, and two of the robbers displayed\n\nguns, with the third robber (Vernon) carrying a bag. After the robbery, the men,\n\nexcept Herron, got into a van parked outside of the pharmacy and drove away.\n\n   For Arvest Bank, the government presented evidence that two armed, masked\n\nmen robbed it. The tellers gave the robbers previously concealed and marked $50\n\nbait bills and a strap of $20 bills containing a GPS tracker. Officers immediately\n\n                                      - 31 -\n\fbegan receiving location updates from the tracker. The device stopped moving\n\nnear 1109 East Pine Street, which was near Vernon’s known residence at 1107\n\nEast Pine Street. The officers obtained a search warrant for Vernon’s house.\n\nBefore they executed the search warrant, the officers arrested Vernon and Stanley\n\nafter they emerged from the house. Upon executing the search warrant, the\n\nofficers found money stolen from the bank, the GPS tracker, a Glock pistol, a\n\nhooded black sweatshirt, a ski mask, gloves, and dark-colored pants, all of which\n\nthey believed had been used in the robbery. This is enough evidence to prove that\n\nVernon was involved in the conspiracy to rob Arvest Bank. That being so, we\n\nconclude that Vernon did not suffer prejudice from any guilt transference.\n\n   In sum, we conclude that Vernon did not suffer substantial prejudice from the\n\nvariance. We affirm his conviction on Count One.\n\n\n                          V. INTRINSIC EVIDENCE\n\n   Vernon argues next that some evidence the district court admitted as intrinsic\n\nto the charged crimes was instead extrinsic. At trial, the government introduced\n\nevidence establishing all six charged robberies, including the three involving\n\nVernon (IBC, Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest Bank), and one robbery not charged to\n\nanyone (CVS Pharmacy). Under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), Vernon objected to the\n\ncourt’s admitting evidence of any robbery not charged to Vernon as improper\n\n\n\n                                      - 32 -\n\fbecause there was no global conspiracy. The trial court admitted all of the\n\nevidence, finding that it was intrinsic evidence, outside the scope of Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b), because it was “closely related to the conspiracy charged and [fell] within\n\nthe relevant time frame.”\n\n   Vernon argues on appeal that the government presented three extra trials\n\nrelating to robberies Vernon certainly did not commit. The government responds\n\nthat the challenged evidence was intrinsic evidence, not subject to Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b), because it all was either charged to one of the coconspirators or it took\n\nplace during the same timeframe as the conspiracy.\n\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) applies only to evidence of acts extrinsic to the charged\n\ncrime. Record, 873 F.2d at 1372 n.5. An uncharged act may not be considered\n\nextrinsic if it was part of the scheme for which a defendant is being prosecuted,\n\nid., or inextricably intertwined with the charged crime such that a witness’s\n\ntestimony would have been confusing and incomplete without mention of the\n\nprior act, United States v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684423\"><a href=\"/opinion/684423/united-states-v-anthony-dean-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1316 (10th Cir. 1994). To be\n\nconsidered intrinsic evidence, rather than extrinsic, “the government’s use of\n\nevidence of wrongful, uncharged acts [must be] necessary to contextualize” the\n\nevidence introduced at trial. United States v. Hood, 774 F.3d. 638, 644 (10th Cir.\n\n2014) (concluding that evidence establishing why the police officers were at a\n\nparticular location qualified as intrinsic evidence, not subject to Fed. R. Evid.\n\n\n                                       - 33 -\n\f404(b)). We review the trial court’s decision to admit evidence for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Neal, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1505</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1509–10 (10th Cir. 1983).\n\n\n                         A. Evidence of the Traffic Stop\n\n   First, Vernon appeals the district court’s decision to admit evidence of a\n\ntraffic stop involving Lewis, Eddie Brown, and Patrick Crisp. In an attempt to\n\nprove a substantive charge against Deandre for the Credit Union robbery, the\n\ngovernment introduced evidence of the traffic stop, which occurred almost a\n\nmonth after that robbery. The evidence showed that during a search of the car, the\n\nofficers found marijuana, two bottles of codeine cough syrup, and a large amount\n\nof cash. The government argued, and the district court agreed, that this evidence\n\nhelped prove the Credit Union robbery.\n\n   We decline to decide whether the district court properly admitted this evidence\n\nas intrinsic evidence for the Credit Union robbery because any error was\n\nharmless. The admission of this evidence constitutes a nonconstitutional error, so\n\nwe only decide whether the evidence, in light of the entire record,\n\n(1) substantially influenced the outcome of the trial or (2) leaves us in grave\n\ndoubt as to whether it had such an effect. Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 764–65\n\n(establishing the harmless error rule); United States v. Tome, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701295\"><a href=\"/opinion/701295/united-states-v-matthew-wayne-tome/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1455\n\n(10th Cir. 1995). The traffic stop did not even involve Vernon, and he makes no\n\n\n\n                                      - 34 -\n\fparticularized argument as to how this evidence substantially influenced the\n\noutcome of his trial. Accordingly, error here, if any, was harmless.\n\n\n                   B. Evidence of the CVS Pharmacy Robbery\n\n   Vernon complains that the district court allowed evidence of the uncharged\n\nCVS Pharmacy robbery just because it occurred within the timeframe of the\n\nconspiracy and was similar to the charged robberies. Separate from his concern\n\nover whether this evidence was intrinsic, Vernon argues that the district court\n\nerred in admitting this evidence because there was no proof that Vernon was\n\ninvolved in the CVS robbery.\n\n   In response, the government contends that this evidence helped establish\n\ninterdependence by demonstrating the individual robbers’ specific roles over the\n\ncourse of multiple robberies. Accordingly, the government argues, the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the CVS robbery as\n\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracy.\n\n   We disagree with the government. Herron told Officer Ryden that Vernon\n\nparticipated in the Metro Pharmacy robbery. Based on this information from\n\nHerron, Officer Ryden compared the video from the Metro Pharmacy robbery to\n\nthe CVS Pharmacy robbery, attempting to ascertain whether any one person\n\nparticipated in both robberies. Based on the video footage, Officer Ryden thought\n\n\n\n                                       - 35 -\n\fthat Lewis participated in both because of his physical appearance, his left-\n\nhandedness, and his use of a firearm in both robberies. He also concluded that\n\nDevers participated in both because of his physical appearance and clothing worn\n\nin both robberies. Finally, Officer Ryden thought that the third person in both\n\nrobberies was Vernon because he looked similar in the videos and he carried a\n\nbag, not a gun.\n\n   During its closing argument, the government discussed the CVS Pharmacy\n\nrobbery, saying, “Following [the Metro Pharmacy robbery], the CVS store was\n\nrobbed. And exactly what happens then? They have now learned, thanks to the\n\nMetro robbery, you steal a vehicle, you don’t leave anything in it.” The\n\ngovernment then went on to compare the CVS robbery to the other robberies,\n\narguing that Vernon was one of the men in the tape from the CVS robbery.\n\n   To admit evidence as intrinsic—and to avoid having to comply with Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 404(b)’s requirements—the evidence must provide context for other\n\nadmissible evidence or witness testimony. The district court explained that “such\n\nevidence can be considered intrinsic evidence falling outside of Rule 404(b)\n\nusually—and this is where I’m hanging my hat on this—usually when that\n\nevidence is closely related to the conspiracy charged and falls within the relevant\n\ntime frame.” The court went on, “I think that describes the evidence that I\n\nanticipate the government intends to introduce. . . . I [find] that it is intrinsically\n\n\n                                        - 36 -\n\fconnected to the evidence that’s been put on of the other robberies so it comes\n\ninto evidence under that theory.” As such, the court concluded that this evidence\n\nfell outside Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)’s scope.\n\n   This is not enough. The CVS Pharmacy robbery evidence needed to provide\n\ncontext to other admissible evidence, or more relevant here, it needed to\n\ncontextualize a witness’s testimony. In Hood, for example, the only way the\n\nofficer could explain being at the apartment complex where he encountered\n\nHood was by referring to the burglary investigation. 774 F.3d at 644. If the\n\nofficer had not mentioned that investigation and background, his testimony about\n\nbeing at the apartment complex would have confused the jury. Id. So had Officer\n\nRyden’s investigation of the CVS Pharmacy robbery led him to suspect Vernon’s\n\ninvolvement in the Metro Pharmacy robbery, or something similar, the CVS\n\nPharmacy robbery evidence would provide context for evidence of the charged\n\ncrime. But that was not the case here. The CVS Pharmacy robbery was merely\n\nevidence of a robbery occurring around the same time, nothing more. Minimizing\n\njury confusion is the most important consideration in determining whether\n\nsomething is intrinsic evidence, not simply when the alleged bad act took place.\n\n   We therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting\n\nthe evidence of the CVS Pharmacy robbery. However, we also conclude that this\n\nerror was harmless. Because the admission of the CVS Pharmacy evidence\n\n\n                                       - 37 -\n\fconstitutes a nonconstitutional error, we review only for whether the evidence, in\n\nlight of the entire record, (1) substantially influenced the outcome of the trial, or\n\n(2) leaves us in grave doubt as to whether it had such an effect. Kotteakos, 328\n\nU.S. at 764–65; Tome, 61 F.3d at 1455.\n\n   In this case, given the breadth and depth of admissible evidence establishing\n\nthe charged robberies, we cannot say that the admission of the CVS Pharmacy\n\nrobbery evidence substantially influenced the outcome of the trial. Certainly, the\n\ngovernment used the evidence to attempt to establish Vernon’s guilt for the\n\nglobal conspiracy count by showing the commonalities between the CVS\n\nPharmacy robbery and the other robberies. But as we have already held above, the\n\ngovernment failed to prove the global conspiracy. As such, the CVS Pharmacy\n\nevidence had little bearing on the trial’s outcome. Further, the admission of the\n\nevidence does not leave us in grave doubt as to whether it had such an effect. We\n\nare therefore confident that the error was harmless, and we affirm the district\n\ncourt.\n\n\n                    VI. GANG-AFFILIATION EVIDENCE\n\n   Vernon also appeals the district court’s decision to admit the gang-affiliation\n\nevidence, arguing it was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. Evidence is relevant\n\nif it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. Fed.\n\n\n\n                                       - 38 -\n\fR. Evid. 401. Under Rule 403, a trial court may exclude otherwise “relevant\n\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of . . .\n\nunfair prejudice . . . .” We “afford[] the district court considerable discretion in\n\nperforming the Rule 403 balancing test because district court judges have\n\nfront-row seats during trial and extensive experience ruling on evidentiary\n\nissues.” United States v.

He argued\n\nthat the evidence was irrelevant and alternatively that Rule 403 precluded\n\nadmission of the evidence. The district court denied the motion, concluding that\n\nthe gang evidence was relevant and that the probative value of the evidence\n\noutweighed the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\n   At trial, the government introduced evidence that Vernon and some of his\n\nother alleged coconspirators were members or affiliates of the Hoover Crips\n\nstreet gang. For instance, Anthony Campbell testified regarding his experience as\n\na member of the Hoover Crips from 1993 to 2003. As discussed already, this was\n\nthe government’s theory of interdependence for the global conspiracy. The Tulsa\n\n\n                                       - 39 -\n\fPolice Department has a system for “certifying” individuals as gang members or\n\naffiliates based on a point system. Officer Steven Sanders testified that Vernon\n\nhad some points, but he did not have enough to be a certified gang member; the\n\nTulsa Police Department considered him only an affiliate of the Hoover Crips.\n\nEven so, Herron testified that Vernon was an actual member of the Hoover Crips,\n\nspecifically the 27 sect. The government used the gang evidence as circumstantial\n\nevidence of interdependence between the coconspirators for all of the charged\n\nrobberies.\n\n   On appeal, Vernon makes only the bare assertion that “the government\n\npresented irrelevant, prejudicial evidence regarding the Hoover Crips street gang\n\n. . . .” Appellant’s Br. at 38. The government responds that the gang affiliation\n\nevidence was probative to establish an agreement among the defendants, the\n\npurpose of the conspiracy, and knowledge by the defendants.\n\n   We first conclude that the evidence was relevant. To prove guilt under Count\n\nOne—that Vernon had conspired with others to rob banks, credit unions, and\n\npharmacies—the government had to show that he agreed with at least one other\n\nperson to do so. See Caldwell, 589 F.3d at 1329. We have previously held that\n\n“where conspiracy is charged[,] gang-affiliation testimony may be relevant.”\n\nArchuleta, 737 F.3d at 1293–94 (citing multiple cases where this court has\n\nallowed gang-related evidence to prove conspiracy); see also, e.g., United States\n\n\n                                      - 40 -\n\fv. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159017\"><a href=\"/opinion/159017/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (10th Cir. 1999) (same). Gang evidence is often\n\nrelevant to the formation of the conspiracy, the agreement of the coconspirators,\n\nthe purpose of the conspiracy, and the knowledge attributable to the conspirators.\n\nRobinson, 978 F.2d at 1562–63. But gang evidence alone cannot support a\n\nconviction. Id. at 1563. Here, we conclude that the gang evidence was properly\n\nadmitted because it provided circumstantial evidence that Vernon was involved in\n\nforming and agreeing to participate in the global conspiracy and knew its\n\npurpose. See id. at 1562–63.\n\n   Certainly, we concluded above that the evidence at trial established\n\ninterdependence only for the smaller conspiracies to rob the individual banks or\n\npharmacies. But we must remember that at the time of the district court’s ruling,\n\nthe district court had properly joined the alleged coconspirators’ trials, and we\n\nreview the district court’s decision based on the facts then available to it. The\n\nprobative value of the gang evidence was considerable, given that Vernon\n\ndisputed interdependence by arguing that the codefendants did not know each\n\nother and did not have a joint motive. Therefore, it was probative circumstantial\n\nevidence to disprove Vernon’s claim. See, e.g., id. at 1562 (“Circumstantial\n\nevidence is often the strongest evidence of conspiracy.”). Even for the individual\n\nconspiracies that the government actually proved at trial, this evidence had\n\nprobative value, just on a smaller scale.\n\n\n                                        - 41 -\n\f   Finally, the danger of unfair prejudice was limited, given that the\n\ngang-affiliation evidence was only a small part of the evidence against Vernon.\n\nOther direct and circumstantial evidence proved that Vernon helped commit the\n\nrobberies. For instance, Herron testified that Vernon met with others to plan the\n\nMetro Pharmacy robbery, including going into the pharmacy with two others and\n\ndemanding money and drugs. For the Arvest Bank robbery, the police discovered\n\nVernon emerging from his house shortly after the robbery. The police later found\n\nthe marked bait bills and the GPS tracker from Arvest Bank inside his house. The\n\nevidence showed that Vernon robbed Arvest Bank with two of his brothers,\n\nmeaning that the jury did not need to rely on the gang-affiliation evidence to find\n\nknowledge, purpose, or agreement among the coconspirators. In sum, Vernon’s\n\ncommon gang membership with his coconspirators was a small part of the\n\nevidence.\n\n   We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\nevidence.\n\n\n                  VII. GANG-CERTIFICATION RECORDS\n\n   Vernon further argues that the district court’s decision to admit his\n\ngang-certification record and its underlying hearsay violated the Confrontation\n\nClause. In Crawford v. Washington, the Supreme Court held that testimonial\n\n\n\n                                       - 42 -\n\fhearsay is barred from admission in a criminal trial unless the witness is\n\nunavailable and the opposing party has had an opportunity for cross-examination.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (2004).

The court did explain:\n\n      Various formulations of this core class of “testimonial” statements\n      exist: “ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent—that\n      is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior\n      testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar\n      pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be\n      used prosecutorially,” . . . “extrajudicial statements . . . contained in\n      formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions,\n      prior testimony, or confessions” . . . “statements that were made\n      under circumstances which would lead an objective witness\n      reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at\n      a later trial,” . . . These formulations all share a common nucleus and\n      then define the Clause’s coverage at various levels of abstraction\n      around it. Regardless of the precise articulation, some statements\n      qualify under any definition—for example, ex parte testimony at a\n      preliminary hearing.\n\nId. at 51–52 (citations omitted).\n\n   Since Crawford, the Court has still not articulated a clear definition of\n\ntestimonial statements. Instead, courts have adopted an ad hoc approach for\n\n\n                                       - 43 -\n\fdetermining whether evidence is testimonial, and the Supreme Court has\n\nspecifically carved out numerous exceptions and limitations.

We have previously explained that testimonial hearsay\n\n“at a minimum, [includes] prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a\n\ngrand jury, at a former trial, and statements made during police interrogations.”\n\nUnited States v. Mendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170226\"><a href=\"/opinion/170226/united-states-v-mendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1043 (10th Cir. 2008) (citing Crawford,\n\n541 U.S. at 68).\n\n   Before trial, the district court found that Officer Sanders was not an expert in\n\ngang membership, but it allowed him to testify as a fact witness regarding “the\n\ngang culture within the Tulsa area, including the operation, structure and\n\nterminology of the gang, based upon his working knowledge of the same. His\n\ntestimony will, however, be governed by Fed. R. Evid. 701.” By the district\n\n\n                                      - 44 -\n\fcourt’s direction, Officer Sanders could not “give his own personal opinion as to\n\nthe gang affiliation of any particular person especially where that opinion differs\n\nfrom the official business records maintained by the Gang Task Force.” The court\n\nalso found that Officer Sanders’s personal opinions would be substantially more\n\nprejudicial than probative under Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n   At trial, Officer Sanders testified about the Tulsa Police Department’s gang-\n\ncertification system and records. He testified that the police department has a\n\ngroup called the “Tulsa Area Response Gang Enforcement Team,” also known as\n\n“TARGET.” The Tulsa Police Department keeps records to track the membership\n\nof various gangs. The gang-certification records indicate whether someone is an\n\naffiliate or a member, depending on the number of points allocated based on a\n\npredetermined scale. The records also reference other criminal investigations by\n\nthe police department. Officer Sanders, as a member of TARGET, testified that\n\nVernon’s record showed Vernon as an affiliate, not a member, of the Hoover\n\nCrips.\n\n   The district court admitted Vernon’s gang-certification record from the Tulsa\n\nPolice Department under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). On appeal, Vernon first argues\n\nthat the record did not qualify as a business record under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 45 -\n\fand that it is testimonial hearsay in violation of the Confrontation Clause. 19 He\n\nargues second that the admission of the underlying hearsay (i.e., the “points”\n\nallocated to a suspected gang member based on the Tulsa Police Department’s\n\nclassification system and the other references in the record) contained within the\n\nrecords violated the Confrontation Clause. Stated differently, Vernon argues for\n\ntwo separate Confrontation Clause violations: (1) the gang-certification record\n\nitself; and (2) the references within the record to other police reports discussing\n\nthe gang activity of Vernon. We discuss each basis for appeal separately below.\n\n\n                         A. Business Records Exception\n\n   Vernon waived his argument that the gang-certification record was not\n\nadmissible as an ordinary business record. At trial, Vernon conceded that the\n\nrecord was an ordinary business record that the police kept, and he did not object\n\nto its admission on grounds that it did not qualify for admission under the\n\nbusiness records exception. At trial, Vernon’s attorney conceded that “[t]he\n   19\n      Vernon also argues to us that the actual gang-certification records were\n“irrelevant pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 401–404, given that there was no proof the\nsupposed global conspiracy involved the Hoover Crips gang.” Appellant’s Br. at\n42. Earlier in Section VI, we concluded that the gang-affiliation evidence was\nrelevant and probative under Rules 401 and 403. For the same reasons we\naffirmed the district court in Section VI, we affirm the district court here under\nRules 401 and 403. As such, at this juncture, we are considering only whether the\ngang-certification records that the Tulsa Police Department maintained were\nincorrectly admitted into evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) and the\nConfrontation Clause.\n\n                                       - 46 -\n\fdocument itself is an ordinary business record that’s kept by the gang task force.”\n\nR. vol. 3, at 1827. Accordingly, to the extent that Vernon now argues that these\n\ndid not qualify under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), we deem that argument waived.\n\n   Vernon responds that his admissions to the district court “did not invite any\n\nerror or waive the hearsay objection” because “[s]trictly speaking, the Gang\n\nCertification records are a type of business record.” Appellant’s Reply Br. at 23.\n\nThis argument is unpersuasive. This case differs from those in which a defendant\n\ngenerally objects on hearsay grounds and later appeals. At the district court,\n\nVernon agreed with the government that the gang-certification record was a\n\nbusiness record. The closest Vernon came to objecting to admission of the gang-\n\ncertification record was when he objected that the gang points allocated to\n\nVernon violated the Confrontation Clause. See R. vol. 3, at 1828 (“The points\n\nthat are attributed by those field interviews are also hearsay and violate[] the\n\nconfrontation clause.”).\n\n   Further, Vernon did not ask for plain error review. We have held that an\n\nappellant waives an argument if he or she fails to raise it in the district court and\n\nlater on appeal fails to argue for plain error. See, e.g., United States v. Burke, 633\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 47 -\n\fF.3d 984, 987–91 (10th Cir. 2011). We therefore do not consider the merits of\n\nVernon’s Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) argument. 20\n\n\n                           B. The Confrontation Clause\n\n   Because Vernon objected generally on Confrontation Clause grounds, we will\n\nconsider whether the admission of the gang-certification record and its underlying\n\nhearsay violated Vernon’s Confrontation Clause rights. 21 Two levels of hearsay\n\nare at play: (1) the gang-certification record itself; and (2) the hearsay statements\n\nwithin the gang-certification record. Vernon argues only that “[t]he records go to\n\na key element of the government’s proof. Admitting the records was harmful and\n\nprejudicial as a matter of law.”\n\n\n   20\n      But even if we did consider the merits, any error would be harmless because\nthis evidence was cumulative in light of Herron’s testimony that Vernon was a\nmember of the Hoover Crips. We explain this more in depth below.\n   21\n      Vernon did object to the admission of the gang-certification records on the\nground that they contained a second level of inadmissible hearsay in violation of\nthe Confrontation Clause, specifically the gang-points allocated and the\nreferences to other police reports. R. vol. 3, at 1827–28 (“And under the\nconfrontation clause, those officers that have produced those documents aren’t\nhere to be cross-examined, it’s completely subjective as to what they saw, what\nthey experienced. That goes into a report that is then referenced by this gang\nsheet and that’s how the points are attributed. The document itself is a business\nrecord; however, the field interviews and the reports that are referenced within\nthere are hearsay. The points that are attributed by those filed interviews are also\nhearsay and violates the confrontation clause.”). The government admits that the\ninformation underlying the gang-certification records was inadmissible and that\nthe admission of that evidence violated the Confrontation Clause.\n\n                                       - 48 -\n\f   The admission of evidence in violation of the Confrontation Clause does not\n\nautomatically cause prejudice that requires reversal. See, e.g., Summers, 414 F.3d\n\nat 1303 (concluding that substantial evidence of guilt renders a Crawford\n\nviolation harmless beyond a reasonable doubt). Instead, we must consider\n\n(1) whether the challenged evidence is hearsay, (2) whether it is testimonial, and\n\nif so, (3) whether its introduction was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited States v. Chavez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169027\"><a href=\"/opinion/169027/united-states-v-chavez/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1277 (10th Cir. 2007) (“Violations of the\n\nConfrontation Clause are subject to harmless error analysis . . . under which ‘the\n\nbeneficiary of a constitutional error must prove beyond a reasonable doubt [that]\n\nthe error complained of did not contribute to the guilty verdict.’”) (quoting\n\nUnited States v.

Second, we also assume, without deciding, that the\n\nunderlying hearsay statements in the gang-certification record were testimonial.\n\nThe government conceded as much for the underlying hearsay statements.\n\nAppellee Br. at 66 (“Vernon’s gang certification record contained three\n\nreferences to field interview reports, all of which appear to have been offered for\n\ntheir truth, and were likely to fall into this Court’s definition of testimonial\n\nhearsay. . . . [T]he information underlying those records was arguably\n\ninadmissible hearsay and violated the Confrontation Clause. However, any error\n\nin admitting the information underlying Vernon’s gang certification was harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.”). This leaves us to decide whether introduction of\n\nthe gang-certification record and the hearsay within it was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.

See Chavez, 481\n\nF.3d at 1277 (reasoning that the cumulative nature and presence of corroborating\n\ntestimony both weigh in favor of concluding that the error did not affect the\n\nguilty verdict). Even if the district court erred in admitting the gang-certification\n\nrecord itself, other admissible evidence in the record established Vernon’s gang\n\naffiliation for the jury. See id. at 1278. As a fellow member of the gang, Herron\n\n\n                                       - 50 -\n\ftestified that Vernon was a member of a particular sect of the Hoover Crips in\n\nTulsa. Thus, any error in admitting the gang-certification record was harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n   Second, the hearsay contained within the gang-certification records was a\n\nsmall part of the government’s evidence. The certification record contained three\n\nhearsay statements from field interview reports where the police noted that\n\nofficers had seen Vernon with other members of the Hoover Crips. This record\n\nalso allocated points to Vernon based on the police’s determination of Vernon’s\n\npurported gang activity. Finally, the report recommended that Vernon be\n\nconsidered a gang affiliate. Given the breadth and depth of the admissible\n\nevidence introduced against Vernon, we do not believe that the underlying\n\nhearsay contained within the gang-certification record affected the jury’s verdict.\n\nInstead, considering the totality of evidence against Vernon, we conclude that it\n\nwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n   We accordingly affirm the district court in part and conclude that any error\n\nhere was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n                        VIII. CELL PHONE RECORDS\n\n   Vernon next appeals the district court’s decision to admit cell phone records\n\nand police testimony interpreting those records. We review evidentiary\n\n\n\n                                       - 51 -\n\fdeterminations for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Blechman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613624\"><a href=\"/opinion/613624/united-states-v-blechman/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1052</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1063 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n   At trial, the government introduced cell phone tower evidence under the\n\nbusiness records exception to the hearsay rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). Matthew\n\nKase, who provides legal compliance services to Cricket Communication,\n\ntestified at trial and authenticated various phone records. He authenticated\n\nrecords for cell phones belonging to Whitney Landrum, Stanley’s girlfriend, for\n\nNovember 4 through November 6, 2011. He also testified about cell phone\n\nrecords for a number subscribed in Vernon’s name. He testified about Vernon’s\n\nphone’s activity from August 12 through August 14, 2011; September 3 through\n\nSeptember 5, 2011; September 8 through September 17, 2011; and November 4\n\nthrough November 6, 2011. 22 Kase also testified about records for Duncan\n\nHerron’s cell phone number for those same periods. Kase further testified about a\n\ncell phone number belonging to Lewis, which included activity for July 26\n\nthrough 27, 2011; August 12 through August 14, 2011; September 3 through\n\nSeptember 5, 2011; September 8 through September 17, 2011; November 4\n\n\n\n\n   22\n     These periods generally corresponded with the Metro Pharmacy robbery and\nthe Arvest Bank robbery.\n\n\n\n                                      - 52 -\n\fthrough November 6, 2011; and December 7 through December 11, 2011.23 In\n\nresponse to a police subpoena, Kase produced all of these records to the police as\n\npart of their investigation. Vernon objected at trial that the records were\n\ntestimonial hearsay, but the district court disagreed and admitted the cell phone\n\nrecords. 24\n\n   For each relevant phone number, Special Agent Andy Kerstetter obtained the\n\n“historical call detail records” for that number. 25 According to Agent Kerstetter,\n\nthose cell phone records identify the number of the calling phone (i.e., incoming\n\nor outgoing), the date and time of the call, and the cell tower and cell tower\n\n   23\n       These periods generally corresponded with the Metro Pharmacy robbery, the\nTulsa Credit Union robbery, and the Arvest Bank robbery.\n    24\n       Vernon argues that the cell phone tower records (which included the phone\nnumbers called, the time of the call, and the cell tower used to place the call)\nwere testimonial, but he admits that he only makes the argument to preserve this\nissue for further appeal. This court has previously held that cell phone tower data\nis admissible under the business records exception and that it is nontestimonial.\nUnited States v. Yeley-Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183069\"><a href=\"/opinion/183069/united-states-v-yeley-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678–81 (10th Cir. 2011). Because\nVernon has only raised this argument to preserve the issue and makes no effort to\nargue the merits, we do not reconsider the issues that we already addressed in\nYeley-Davis.\n\n    25 Vernon claims that Agent Kerstetter could not testify regarding these\nmatters as a fact witness because he lacked personal knowledge. Vernon does not\ncite to any point in the record where he raised this argument to the district court,\nand we will not do an exhaustive search of the record to identify whether Vernon\nproperly preserved this argument. He merely points us to the point in the record\nwhere the district court allowed Agent Kerstetter to testify as a fact witness. Even\nif Vernon properly preserved this argument, it would be unavailing because\nAgent Kerstetter properly relied on these cell phone records during the course of\nhis investigation.\n\n                                       - 53 -\n\fsector used. For each of the phone numbers, including Vernon’s, Agent Kerstetter\n\nexamined the relevant data. He turned this data into a map that depicted the\n\ninformation collected from the cell phone company.\n\n   During a Daubert hearing, the district court concluded that Agent Kerstetter\n\ncould not testify as an expert regarding the cell phone data, but that he could\n\ntestify as a fact witness about certain findings of his investigation. For instance,\n\nthe court allowed Agent Kerstetter to present diagrams he had created, depicting\n\nthe locations of the cell towers and sectors listed in the cell phone records and the\n\nlocations of the charged robberies. In those diagrams, he chose a relevant\n\ntimeframe (such as during a robbery), listed a particular phone number, and\n\nshowed aerial views of each individual location based on the sectors and towers\n\nin use. The district court disallowed Agent Kerstetter from providing any opinion\n\nabout the range of cell towers, the exact location of any particular phone, and\n\nwho was using the phones at the dates and times listed.\n\n   Vernon argues that the district court impermissibly allowed Agent Kerstetter\n\nto testify about where certain of the Defendants’ phones were located when\n\ncertain calls were placed. 26 Based on our reading of the record, the district court\n\n\n\n   26\n      Vernon also argues that the court did not allow complete cross-examination\nof Agent Kerstetter, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. He points to no place\nin the record where he preserved this argument and does not ask for plain error on\n\n                                       - 54 -\n\fallowed Agent Kerstetter to testify only about what tower was in use for a\n\nparticular call, and he was prohibited from opining about the exact location of a\n\nparticular phone.\n\n   Because Agent Kerstetter testified only about the facts contained within these\n\nrecords, we conclude that his testimony did not run afoul of Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\nWe also conclude that his use of diagrams and maps was appropriate under Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 1006. Under Rule 1006, witnesses “may use a summary, chart, or\n\ncalculation to prove the content of voluminous writings, recordings, or\n\nphotographs . . . .” See also, e.g., United States v. Samaniego, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158482\"><a href=\"/opinion/158482/united-states-v-samaniego/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1223–24 (10th Cir. 1999) (requiring admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) of\n\ntelephone records before admitting summary charts of the records under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 1006). 27\n\n   Unlike with Agent Kerstetter, the district court allowed Special Agent Charlie\n\nJones to testify about the location of phones at given times based on the same cell\n\n\nappeal. As such, we do not consider the merits of this argument. See Burke, 633\nF.3d at 987–91.\n   27\n      Vernon argues that only an expert could create these maps and diagrams.\nVernon submits that the “arcs and angles” represented a judgment call and an\nexpert opinion regarding the coverage of each tower. We disagree. After\nreviewing the maps, we conclude that they were proper summary diagrams from\nthe cell phone records available to Agent Kerstetter. The government cites to\nmultiple places in the record where Agent Kerstetter explained that the coverage\nareas were “angled at whatever angle is depicted by [the cell phone company] as\nthe cellular provider’s tower location and angle of that sector.”\n\n                                       - 55 -\n\fphone records. Agent Jones provided his opinion as to where a particular cell\n\nphone was located, sometimes even down to the particular street. Vernon argues\n\nthat Agent Jones’s testimony regarding the street location of particular cell\n\nphones was expert testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 702 and that because Agent\n\nJones was not qualified as an expert, it was improper opinion testimony. The\n\ngovernment responds that Vernon failed to object properly to Agent Jones’s\n\ntestimony at trial, and it argues for plain error review. We conclude that Vernon\n\nobjected when Agent Jones offered an opinion regarding the cell phone locations,\n\nand as such, he properly preserved this issue.\n\n   Because the government makes no effort to argue that Agent Jones’s testimony\n\nwas not improper expert testimony, we will assume, without deciding, that the\n\ndistrict court should not have permitted him to testify as he did. The government\n\nargues only that any error was harmless. “A non-constitutional error is harmless\n\nunless it had a ‘substantial influence’ on the outcome or leaves one in ‘grave\n\ndoubt’ as to whether it had such effect.” United States v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539940\"><a href=\"/opinion/539940/united-states-v-luis-anthony-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1469 (10th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (quoting Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 765). We do not\n\nthink that Agent Jones’s testimony regarding the location of the cell phones had a\n\nsubstantial influence on the outcome of the jury’s verdicts against Vernon.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 56 -\n\f   The trial record reveals abundant evidence establishing Vernon’s guilt on each\n\ncharge. 28 Vernon even admits that “[t]he government used the phone records to\n\ncorroborate Duncan Herron’s account of the Metro Pharmacy robbery,”\n\nAppellant’s Reply Br. at 21, which makes any inadmissible evidence cumulative\n\nbecause the jury had already heard similar evidence. Further, the district court\n\nproperly admitted some of the cell phone data, including Agent Kerstetter’s\n\ntestimony regarding the numbers called and the cell phone towers used to place\n\nthose calls, making some of Agent Jones’s testimony cumulative.\n\n   The jury heard admissible evidence establishing that Devers’s phone had\n\ncalled the Metro Pharmacy twice before the robbery, that Devers’s phone and\n\nHerron’s phone had communicated by text message during the robbery, and that\n\nLewis’s phone and Vernon’s phone had contacted each other by cell phone during\n\nthe robbery. All of this evidence was relevant and admissible. Herron also\n\ntestified extensively about Vernon’s involvement in planning and executing the\n\nMetro Pharmacy robbery. Also, based on the dates and times from the cell phone\n\nrecords during the Arvest Bank robbery (not the location of the phones), the jury\n\ncould infer that Vernon and Stanley were communicating before the Arvest Bank\n\nrobbery. The jury also heard the police testify that they followed the GPS tracker,\n\n   28\n     The government did not rely on cell phone evidence to prove the IBC Bank\nrobbery. The government did use cell phone evidence for the Metro Pharmacy\nrobbery and the Arvest Bank robbery.\n\n                                       - 57 -\n\fwhich led them to Vernon, who had in his home the stolen money from the\n\nrobbery, the GPS tracker, and one set of the clothes used in the robbery. In light\n\nof all of this evidence, the cell phone evidence’s importance is minimal for\n\nVernon’s convictions.\n\n   We affirm the district court in part and conclude that any error from Agent\n\nJones’s testimony was harmless.\n\n\n                      IX. EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATIONS\n\n   Vernon appeals the district court’s decision to allow the government to\n\nintroduce eyewitness-identification testimony from the IBC Bank robbery. On the\n\nday of the IBC Bank robbery, Ms. DeLeon was working as a teller. A person\n\nentered the bank and engaged her with two minutes of face-to-face small talk. He\n\nthen told her that he had a gun and demanded money. She gave him money from\n\nher teller drawer. The robber saw another teller counting money and demanded\n\nthat money as well.\n\n   Two years later, a police officer showed Ms. DeLeon a bank security\n\nphotograph, which showed the robber standing at her teller window. Not\n\nsurprisingly, she confirmed that the picture showed the suspect as she\n\nremembered him from the day of the robbery. After putting the photograph from\n\nthe robbery away, the officer then showed Ms. DeLeon a six-person photo-lineup.\n\n\n\n                                      - 58 -\n\fEven after he told her that the suspect was not necessarily included in the lineup,\n\nshe identified Vernon by circling his picture. At trial, Ms. DeLeon identified\n\nVernon in-person as the robber she had encountered at IBC Bank. During the\n\ntrial, two other witnesses from IBC Bank also identified Vernon in-person as the\n\nrobber.\n\n   Before trial, Vernon filed a motion in limine to exclude all eyewitness-\n\nidentifications of Vernon from the IBC Bank robbery. Over Vernon’s objections,\n\nthe court admitted the results of the photo lineup and Ms. DeLeon’s eyewitness\n\nidentifications. He argues to us that the identification procedure was\n\nunnecessarily suggestive and that the district court should have excluded the\n\nphoto-identification.\n\n   Vernon also argues that the photo-lineup identification “violated F.R.E. 401–\n\n03.” He asserts that “[i]t is of very limited relevance that Ms. DeLeon thinks that\n\nout of six photographed persons selected by the government, Vernon Hill looks\n\nthe most like the person who is shown in the photo from the robbery itself. Ms.\n\nDeLeon’s testimony also served to invade the province of the jury, [telling] the\n\njury what factual finding to make.” Appellant’s Br. at 52.\n\n   We identify three distinct arguments from Vernon’s appeal on this issue:\n\n(1) the photo-lineup identification was irrelevant because Ms. DeLeon was only\n\nidentifying the person from the photo lineup who best matched the photo from the\n\n\n                                       - 59 -\n\fday of the robbery; (2) the photo-lineup identification invaded the province of the\n\njury; and (3) the procedure used to obtain the photo-lineup identification was\n\nunnecessarily suggestive. We find each unpersuasive.\n\n   First, the photo-lineup identification was relevant. We review questions under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 401 for an abuse of discretion. Flanagan, 34 F.3d at 952–53. Under\n\nRule 401, something is relevant “if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more\n\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of\n\nconsequence in determining the action.” Ms. DeLeon’s identification makes it\n\nmore probable that Vernon robbed the IBC Bank than it would be without her\n\nidentification. Ms. DeLeon was working the day of the robbery, and she\n\ninteracted with Vernon before and during the robbery. Her identification of\n\nVernon is relevant because that evidence makes it more likely that Vernon was\n\nindeed the bank robber. Whether Ms. DeLeon’s identification from the photo\n\narray is a good identification goes to weight rather than admissibility. Ms.\n\nDeLeon’s eyewitness identification in the photo array satisfies Rule 401.\n\n   Also, the probative value of this identification was not substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403. We review a\n\ndistrict court’s admission of evidence under Rule 403 for an abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Cerno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170879\"><a href=\"/opinion/170879/united-states-v-cerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 (10th Cir. 2008). “In engaging in the\n\nrequisite balancing, we ‘give the evidence its maximum reasonable probative\n\n\n                                       - 60 -\n\fforce and its minimum reasonable prejudicial value.’” Id.

Police showed Ms. DeLeon a photo taken in\n\nthe IBC Bank on the day of the robbery and asked whether the person in the\n\npicture at her teller window was the person she remembered robbing the bank. 29\n\nThis identification occurred nearly two years after the robbery. After looking at\n\nthe picture, she confirmed that the man in the photograph was the robber. Almost\n\nimmediately after this, she identified Vernon as the robber from a six-person\n\nphoto array. 30 Vernon’s only argument for unfair prejudice is that “[i]t is of very\n\nlimited relevance” whether Ms. DeLeon thinks the person from the photograph of\n\nthe robbery is in the photo array. Yet this is not unfair prejudice: whether Ms.\n\nDeLeon’s identification from the photo array is a good identification goes to\n\nweight rather than admissibility, and the weight of her identification is not at\n\n\n\n   29\n        This photo was given to the jury.\n   30\n        The photo-array was provided to the jury.\n\n                                            - 61 -\n\fissue here. We conclude that the district court properly admitted her identification\n\nof Vernon under Rule 403.\n\n   Second, the identification does not invade the province of the jury. Ms.\n\nDeLeon made her identification, and the jury was free to look at the photo array\n\nand discredit her testimony. Again, this goes to weight rather than admissibility.\n\nWe conclude that this did not invade the province of the jury.\n\n   Third, Vernon argues that the district court violated his due process rights\n\nwhen it admitted the photo-array identification from Ms. DeLeon. The\n\ngovernment argues that the process was not unnecessarily suggestive, that the\n\nidentification was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, and\n\nalternatively, that any error was harmless.\n\n   “[D]ue process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an\n\nidentification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary. . . . Even when\n\nthe police use such a procedure, . . . suppression of the resulting identification is\n\nnot the inevitable consequence.” Perry v.

If a reviewing court concludes that the identification procedure was\n\nunnecessarily suggestive and that the identification was not reliable under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, it evaluates the erroneous admission under harmless\n\nerror.

First, contrary to Vernon’s argument that the individuals depicted do\n\nnot look alike, we conclude that the suspects in the photo array are sufficiently\n\nsimilar. Second, the officer did not show Ms. DeLeon a picture of the suspect and\n\ntell her to match it to the photo array, although the two identifications occurred\n\nwithin minutes of each other. Instead, he asked her if the man in the photograph\n\nfrom the robbery was the one she remembered coming into the bank. She said he\n\nwas. She then selected Vernon from the photo array. Even further, the\n\nidentification has other indicia of reliability. During the robbery, Ms. DeLeon\n\ninteracted with the robber for two minutes, in a friendly manner, before he\n\nattempted to rob the bank.\n\n   Finally, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Ms. DeLeon\n\nidentified Vernon in court, based off her interactions with him during the\n\nrobbery. Any problem with the photo-array lineup is not so severe as to taint this\n\n\n                                      - 63 -\n\fin-court identification. And importantly, two other eyewitnesses from the IBC\n\nBank robbery identified Vernon at trial as the robber. Vernon does not challenge\n\nthese identifications on appeal. The in-court identifications are enough to ensure\n\nthat any error with Ms. DeLeon’s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n   We affirm the district court.\n\n\n                           X. CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n   Lastly, Vernon argues that he is entitled to a new trial because of cumulative\n\nerror.

Precisely because a fundamental-fairness\n        analysis is not subject to clearly definable legal elements, however,\n        we must approach such analysis with considerable self-restraint.\n        “Courts should tread gingerly when faced with arguments”\n        concerning “the ‘fundamental fairness’ component of the Fifth\n        Amendment’s Due Process Clause,” which should be reserved for\n        “the most serious cases, which truly shock the conscience as well as\n        the mind.”\n\nRivera, 900 F.2d at 1477 (quoting United States v. Penn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390032\"><a href=\"/opinion/390032/united-states-v-clara-b-penn-aka-clara-b-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 880 (9th\n\nCir. 1980) (en banc)).\n\n   There are multiple errors in this case. Because the two assumed Confrontation\n\nClause errors are constitutional in nature, the cumulative error must be harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. 31 Toles, 297 F.3d at 972. Given the extremely high\n\nbar set for cumulative error, we conclude that the errors in this case do not rise to\n\nthe level such that they “truly shock the conscience as well as the mind.” Rivera,\n\n900 F.2d at 1477 (quoting Penn, 647 F.2d at 880) (internal quotation mark\n\nomitted). Even absent the errors, there was overwhelming evidence establishing\n\nVernon’s guilt in the commission of the three robberies and in the conspiracy to\n\nrob the Metro Pharmacy and the conspiracy to rob Arvest Bank. Vernon does not\n\nsufficiently argue that his is a “most serious case[]” that “truly shock[s] the\n\n\n   31\n     We assumed, without deciding, that there was error under the Confrontation\nClause as to the gang-certification records and the underlying hearsay.\n\n                                        - 65 -\n\fconscience as well as the mind.” See id. In a long and complex trial, the district\n\ncourt erred in making some evidentiary determinations and in determining that\n\nthe evidence at trial did support the government’s allegation that there was a\n\nglobal conspiracy to rob banks, credit unions, and pharmacies throughout Tulsa.\n\nYet these errors together do not rise to the level of a due process violation. We\n\nconclude that there is not cumulative error.\n\n\n                               XI. CONCLUSION\n\n   We affirm Vernon’s convictions as to all counts.\n\n\n                                      ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                      Gregory A. Phillips\n                                      Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 66 -\n\fNo. 13-5084, United States v Veronon Hill\n\nMcHUGH, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I am pleased to join in the majority’s well-reasoned Order and Judgment affirming\n\nVernon’s convictions. I write separately to explain why I conclude the variance in this\n\ncase did not prejudice Vernon’s right to a fair trial. As I described in my concurring and\n\ndissenting opinion in United States v. [Dejuan] Hill, __ F.3d __, No. 13-5074 (10th Cir.\n\nMay 22, 2015) (McHugh, J. concurring and dissenting), the government’s decision to\n\ncharge and try the defendants for participating in a global conspiracy for which there was\n\ninsufficient evidence carried with it the risk of prejudicial spillover. But in Vernon’s case,\n\nthe variance did not cause substantial prejudice. The government alleged Vernon\n\nparticipated in four of the seven robberies (specifically, the IBC Bank, CVS Pharmacy\n\n(uncharged), Metro Pharmacy, and Arvest Bank). As the majority explains, much of the\n\ngang evidence admitted was directly relevant to Vernon’s involvement in the conspiracy\n\nto rob the Metro Pharmacy. And even if the global conspiracy theory allowed the\n\ngovernment to offer some irrelevant and potentially inflammatory evidence related to the\n\nHoover Crips gang or other robberies in which Vernon played no role, the compelling\n\nevidence of Vernon’s guilt with respect to the Metro Pharmacy and Arvest Bank\n\nrobberies makes it unlikely the admission of this evidence improperly influenced the\n\njury’s verdict. Therefore, I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the variance did not\n\ninterfere with Vernon’s right to a fair trial.\n\n       I join all other parts of the majority’s Order and Judgment in full.\n\f</pre>",
