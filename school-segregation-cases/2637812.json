(“Hallmark”),      for      copyright\ninfringement for building hundreds of buildings from its designs without\nlicensing them.

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH\nCIR.

Mid-Continent claimed the policies did not cover copyright\ninfringement directly, only advertising injury arising out of copyright\ninfringement, and that the prior judgment did not establish advertising injury.\nThe parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The judge granted\nKFA’s motion and denied Mid-Continent’s, rendering judgment against the\nMid-Continent in the amount of the prior judgment plus attorney’s fees. Mid-\nContinent appealed, arguing that it has no duty to indemnify but, in the event\nit does, the attorney’s fees award is not supported under Texas law. 1 For the\nreasons set out below, we affirm.\nI.     BACKGROUND 2\n       KFA is an architecture firm that designs homes and then licenses those\ndesigns to other companies to build. Hallmark, a homebuilder in the Houston,\nTexas area, entered into several architectural services and license agreements\nwith KFA. Under these agreements, KFA agreed to supply Hallmark with 11\ndifferent house designs, each of which Hallmark was authorized to build once.\nIf Hallmark wished to build any copy after that first licensed copy, it was\nrequired to pay KFA in advance for a license. Under the agreements,\nHallmark’s failure to pay for a license for reuse of a plan rendered null and\nvoid KFA’s grant of the right to reuse it.\n       After building the first licensed copy of each of the 11 house plans,\nHallmark built several hundred more copies without paying KFA. When KFA\ndiscovered Hallmark’s actions, it sued Hallmark for copyright infringement,\nseeking actual damages or, in the alternative, statutory damages for the\n\n\n       1  Because the district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, this\ncourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n        2 Unless otherwise noted, the undisputed facts in this section come from the district\n\ncourt’s opinion, see Mid-Continent Cas. Co. v. Kipp Flores Architects, LLC, No. 1:13-CV-60-\nJRN, 2014 WL 3417544 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 3, 2014), as well as the pleadings in the prior suit,\nthe agreements between KFA and Hallmark, and the policies Mid-Continent issued to\nHallmark.\n                                             2\n\f     Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594         Page: 3    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n               No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\ninfringement under 17 U.S.C. § 504. In its Second Amended Complaint, KFA\nspecifically asserted:\n              Defendants have created, published and used non-\n              pictorial depictions of structures based on KFA’s\n              Copyrighted Works in promotional and advertising\n              materials. Defendants have published and used these\n              infringing materials in the course of advertising their\n              infringing structures. Furthermore, defendants have\n              used the structures themselves to advertise their\n              infringing structures. These infringing advertising\n              activities have resulted in the sales of infringing\n              structures described above. Furthermore, these\n              infringing advertising activities, and the resulting\n              infringing sales, are and have been a substantial\n              factor in the value of any infringing structures that\n              defendants have not yet sold, and the prices that\n              buyers would be willing to pay for such structures.\n       Hallmark filed for bankruptcy before trial, but the trial went forward\nbecause Hallmark was potentially covered by the Mid-Continent policies at\nissue in this action. The jury returned a verdict in favor of KFA on September\n12, 2012, finding that Hallmark had infringed all 11 of KFA’s designs and\nfinding the amount of profit attributable to the infringement. The district court\nentered a final judgment on October 4, 2012, establishing that Hallmark had\ninfringed KFA’s copyrights and allowing KFA an unsecured claim in\nHallmark’s bankruptcy in the amount of $3,231,084 plus taxable costs of\n$8,604.40. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 3\n       On January 23, 2012, Mid-Continent filed this action seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it had no duty to indemnify under the policies it\nissued to Hallmark. The policies, discussed in detail below, generally exclude\ncoverage for copyright infringement, but they exempt from that exclusion—i.e.,\n\n\n\n       3 Kipp Flores Architects, L.L.C. v. Hallmark Design Homes, L.P., 544 F. App’x 553, 554\n(5th Cir. 2013).\n                                             3\n\f      Case: 14-50649         Document: 00512950594         Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n              No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\ncover—an “advertising injury” arising out of infringement in Hallmark’s\n“advertisement,” as defined in the policies. The policies also provide that the\nholder of a judgment against Hallmark may recover under the policies.\n       Mid-Continent filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a\njudgment that the policies do not provide coverage for the judgment of\ncopyright infringement for a number of reasons. Most notably, Mid-Continent\nargued that the prior judgment was not for a covered “advertising injury”\nbecause the infringement did not take place in an “advertisement” as defined\nin the policies. KFA filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment\nclaiming the policies do cover the prior judgment. The district court granted\nKFA’s motion and denied Mid-Continent’s, and it awarded attorney’s fees to\nKFA under Texas law based on KFA’s contingency fee arrangement with its\nattorneys.\n       Mid-Continent appealed both the coverage and attorney’s fees issues on\na number of grounds. For the reasons set out below, we affirm.\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.       Applicable Law And Policy Language\n       This court “review[s] a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\nnovo,” applying the usual standards under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. 4 The parties\nagree that Texas law governs this insurance dispute, so we must look to state\nlaw for the rules of policy interpretation and the burden of proof.\n                1.      Interpretation of Insurance Contracts\n\n       Texas’s rules for interpreting insurance contracts are straightforward:\n                Texas courts “construe insurance policies according to\n                the same rules of construction that apply to contracts\n                generally.” When interpreting insurance contracts,\n                courts seek “to ascertain the true intentions of the\n                parties as expressed in the instrument.” To this end,\n\n\n       4   RSR Corp. v. Int’l Ins. Co., 612 F.3d 851, 857 (5th Cir. 2010).\n                                                 4\n\f     Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594         Page: 5    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n              Texas courts “examine and consider the entire writing\n              in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the\n              provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered\n              meaningless,” give policy terms “their ordinary and\n              commonly understood meaning unless the policy itself\n              shows the parties intended a different, technical\n              meaning,” and “strive to honor the parties’ agreement\n              and not remake their contract by reading additional\n              provisions into it[.]”\n              Moreover, courts must decide if a contract contains\n              ambiguous provisions. If the contract “can be given a\n              definite or certain meaning as a matter of law,” courts\n              will not consider the contract to be ambiguous. A\n              provision is not ambiguous “simply because the parties\n              interpret a policy differently.” Rather, a court will find\n              a term ambiguous if “the language of a policy or\n              contract is subject to two or more reasonable\n              interpretations.” If a contract is ambiguous, such\n              ambiguity will be construed against the insurer. 5\n              2.     Burden of Proof on Coverage and Exclusions\n\n       Texas law recognizes that “the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify\n‘are distinct and separate duties.’” 6 Because Mid-Continent already paid for\nHallmark’s defense in the first suit, this suit does not concern the duty to\ndefend but the duty to indemnify.\n              While analysis of the duty to defend has been strictly\n              circumscribed by the eight-corners doctrine, it is well\n              settled that the “facts actually established in the\n              underlying suit control the duty to indemnify.” As with\n              any other contract, breach or compliance with the\n              terms of an insurance policy is determined not by\n              pleadings, but by proof. . . .\n\n\n\n\n       5 United Nat. Ins. Co. v. Mundell Terminal Servs., Inc., 740 F.3d 1022, 1027 (5th Cir.\n2014) (citations omitted).\n       6 D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd. v. Markel Int’l Ins. Co., 300 S.W.3d 740, 743 (Tex. 2009)\n\n(hereinafter Horton) (quoting Utica Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Am. Indem. Co., 141 S.W.3d 198, 203\n(Tex. 2004)).\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 14-50649          Document: 00512950594   Page: 6   Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                     No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n                The insurer’s duty to indemnify depends on the facts\n                proven and whether the damages caused by the\n                actions or omissions proven are covered by the terms\n                of the policy. Evidence is usually necessary in the\n                coverage litigation to establish or refute an insurer’s\n                duty to indemnify. 7\n      The major issue in this case is whether the underlying judgment, which\nestablished that Hallmark infringed the copyrights of KFA by constructing\nhomes from KFA’s designs without a license to do so, triggered coverage for an\n“advertising injury” under the policy terms.\n                3.     Policy Language\n\n      Five successive one-year policies were in effect from May 28, 2004 to May\n28, 2009, but the relevant language is the same in each. Under COVERAGE B\nPERSONAL AND ADVERTISING INJURY LIABILITY, the policies provide:\n                a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes\n                legally obligated to pay as damages because of\n                “personal and advertising injury” to which this\n                insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to\n                defend the insured against any “suit” seeking those\n                damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the\n                insured against any “suit” seeking damages for\n                “personal and advertising injury” to which this\n                insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion,\n                investigate any offense and settle any claim or “suit”\n                that may result. . . .\n      The policies define “personal and advertising injury” as “injury . . .\narising out of one or more of the following offenses: . . . infringing upon\nanother’s copyright, trade dress or slogan in your ‘advertisement.’” Section V.1\nof the policies defines “advertisement” as follows:\n                1. “Advertisement” means a notice that is broadcast or\n                published to the general public or specific market\n                segments about your goods, products or services for\n\n\n      7   Id. at 744 (citations omitted).\n                                            6\n\f       Case: 14-50649   Document: 00512950594     Page: 7   Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n              the purpose of attracting customers or supporters. For\n              the purposes of this definition:\n                    a. Notices that are published include material\n                    placed on the Internet or on similar electronic\n                    means of communication; and\n                    b. Regarding web-sites, only that part of a web-\n                    site that is about your goods, products or\n                    services for the purpose of attracting customers\n                    or supporters is considered an advertisement.\n        Finally, the policies provide an exclusion for most copyright infringement\nexcept for infringement in advertisements:\n              2. Exclusions\n              This insurance does not apply to:\n                    i. Infringement Of Copyright,            Patent,\n                    Trademark Or Trade Secret\n                    “Personal and advertising injury” arising out of\n                    the     infringement of copyright, patent,\n                    trademark, trade secret or other intellectual\n                    property rights.\n              However, this exclusion does not apply to\n              infringement, in your “advertisement”, of copyright,\n              trade dress or slogan.\nIII.    MID-CONTINENT OWES A DUTY TO INDEMNIFY.\n        Mid-Continent argues: (a) there is no coverage because the prior\njudgment did not concern an “advertising injury” on its face; (b) KFA relied\nprimarily on the use of the houses as “advertisements,” but a house cannot be\nan advertisement under the policies; (c) KFA has not shown sufficient\ncausation under the policies; and (d) assuming it can recover at all, KFA failed\nto segregate covered damages from non-covered damages. We find no merit in\nany of these arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f     Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594         Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n       A.     The Hallmark Judgment Adjudicated The Facts Necessary\n              To Establish An “Advertising Injury” If A Model Home Can\n              Be An “Advertisement” Under The Policy.\n       Mid-Continent argues that the policy language cited above does not cover\nthe copyright infringement judgment in this case because the previous\njudgment said nothing of “advertising injury,” and the jury never had to decide\nwhether there was an advertising injury. Mid-Continent’s interpretation of the\nprior judgment is also too narrow.\n       In its order on cross motions for summary judgment, the district court\nset out the following test for determining whether a policy covers “advertising\ninjury”: “(1) the allegations in the underlying complaint must raise a ‘potential’\nfor liability under one of the covered offenses stated in the policy; (2) the\ninsured must have engaged in ‘advertising activity’ during the policy period\nwhen the alleged ‘advertising injury’ occurred; and (3) there must be a causal\nconnection between the alleged injury and the ‘advertising activity.’” 8 The\ndistrict court concluded that the Hallmark judgment directly established an\n“advertising injury” under that test because, even though the prior verdict did\nnot “identically mirror” the policy language, the prior judgment:\n              conclusively establishes Hallmark’s liability to KFA\n              for copyright infringement, including copyright\n              infringement    committed     in    connection     with\n              Hallmark’s ‘advertising.’ That is a covered offense\n              explicitly stated in Mid–Continent’s policies.\n              Additionally, the record conclusively establishes that\n              Hallmark engaged in “advertising activities” (in both\n              website and print advertising and the use of infringing\n              houses in its marketing activities) during the policy\n              periods. 9\n\n\n\n       8 2014 WL 3417544 at *3 (citing Bay Elec.

The test the district court used was based on duty to defend cases, which,\nas noted above, rely on the eight-corners doctrine (i.e., the language of the\ncomplaint and the language of the policy) to determine whether the plaintiff\nhas stated a potentially coverable claim. 10 Instead, the district court should\nhave applied the duty to indemnify test set out in Horton: “The insurer’s duty\nto indemnify depends on the facts proven and whether the damages caused by\nthe actions or omissions proven are covered by the terms of the policy. Evidence\nis usually necessary in the coverage litigation to establish or refute an insurer’s\nduty to indemnify.” 11\n      That does not change the result here under de novo review, however.\nMid-Continent’s emphasis on the prior judgment’s failure to specifically refer\nto an “advertising injury” is an unduly narrow view of the “facts proven” rule.\nAs the Texas Supreme Court noted in Horton, a coverage suit often requires\nthe parties to submit evidence of facts which were not specifically covered at\nthe earlier trial. In footnote 3 of Horton, the court cited with approval a Fifth\nCircuit case applying Texas law in which this court reasoned:\n             Finally, we find that the district court properly\n             concluded that Appellees may present evidence at trial\n             regarding facts necessary to determine coverage that\n             were not adjudicated in the underlying case. The\n             underlying case often does not resolve all the factual\n             issues necessary to determine coverage because issues\n             relevant to the question of coverage can be irrelevant\n             to the question of the insured’s liability. See Utica\n             Nat’l Ins. Co. of Tex. v. Am. Indem. Co., 141 S.W.3d\n             198, 204 (Tex. 2004) (“It may sometimes be necessary\n             to defer resolution of indemnity issues until the\n             liability litigation is resolved.”). . . . Therefore, courts\n\n\n      10 Bay Electric Supply and Sentry addressed the duty to defend, not the duty to\nindemnify, with respect to the pleadings test.\n      11 300 S.W.3d at 744.\n\n                                          9\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594        Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                   No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n              are not precluded from making factual findings in\n              coverage actions. Otherwise, insureds . . . can never\n              establish coverage whenever there is an underlying\n              trial and an issue irrelevant to liability but essential\n              to coverage. 12\n       In this case, the issue of “advertising injury” was irrelevant to copyright\ninfringement liability but is essential to coverage under the policy. For the\ncopyright infringement claim, the jury was only required to find that Hallmark\ninfringed KFA’s copyright with respect to the 11 home designs, not to make a\nspecial finding concerning whether or not that infringement took place in an\n“advertisement” within the terms of the policy.\n       Because the jury determined that the houses themselves infringed KFA’s\ncopyright, the determinative question for coverage under the policies is\nwhether the houses themselves were “advertisements” such that the jury\nverdict potentially gives rise to coverage as an “injury . . . arising out of . . .\ninfringing upon another’s copyright, trade dress or slogan in your\n‘advertisement.’” The outcome here is determined both by the policy language\nand by the fact that KFA has presented ample evidence that Hallmark used\nthe infringing houses for marketing purposes, and Mid-Continent has never\noffered any evidence to the contrary.\n       B.     Under The Policy Terms And The Uncontroverted Facts,\n              The Infringing Houses Were “Advertisements.”\n       Even though the prior suit did not require KFA to present evidence\nconcerning advertising, KFA presented a great deal of evidence on the subject.\nKFA has always contended that Hallmark infringed KFA’s copyright in its\nadvertisements       and     that     the     structures     themselves       constituted\nadvertisements. Beyond these contentions, KFA presented evidence that the\n\n\n\n       12Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Puget Plastics Corp., 532 F.3d 398,\n404 (5th Cir. 2008) (footnote omitted).\n                                            10\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594        Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n               No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\nhouses themselves were used to attract customers, in addition to evidence of\nwebsite and print promotional materials. Indeed, on appeal in this case, Mid-\nContinent concedes that KFA presented evidence that the houses themselves\nwere Hallmark’s primary form of marketing. 13\n       One of Hallmark’s representatives testified in deposition in this suit that\nhomebuyers never bought houses sight unseen, but rather would look at the\nmodel homes Hallmark built as well as elevations and floor plans in the sales\noffice or on the website. In addition, Hallmark put up yard signs with its\ncontact information on the sites of homes it built to attract customers.\n       Mid-Continent does not dispute the fact that Hallmark used the\ninfringing homes themselves to market to customers, so we must accept that\nfact as true under Rule 56. Rather than attack the facts, Mid-Continent argues\nthat an infringing house can never be an “advertisement” under the policies as\na matter of law. Again, the policies define “advertisement” as “a notice that is\nbroadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about\nyour goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or\nsupporters.” Mid-Continent argues that, under the policy terms and common\nsense, a house cannot be a “notice,” and it cannot be “broadcast or published.”\nMid-Continent cites no controlling authority that might require the narrow\nreading proposed.\n       It is important to note that the policies never specify that “notice” must\ntake any particular form (e.g., a writing or a website) and never exclude from\nthe definition a physical object, nor do they define “broadcast” or “published.”\nAmong other things, the Oxford English Dictionary defines “notice” sweepingly\nas the “act of imparting information” or “something which imparts\n\n\n\n       13Mid-Continent also concedes that Hallmark infringed KFA’s copyright in at least\none non-house advertisement, but the bulk of its appeal focuses on whether or not the houses\nwere “advertisements” under the policies.\n                                            11\n\f    Case: 14-50649        Document: 00512950594           Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\ninformation.” 14 The few cases interpreting the policy language at issue here (“a\nnotice that is broadcast or published”) have construed “notice” very broadly. 15\nUnder the policy language, such notice need only be broadcast or published to\nqualify as an advertisement. While “broadcast” generally implies radio or\ntelevision advertisement, 16 “publish” is much more comprehensively defined as\n“to make public or generally known” or “to make generally accessible or\navailable for acceptance or use (a work of art, information, etc.); to present to\nor before the public.” 17 Thus, the policy language does not support the\nrestrictions Mid-Continent proposes.\n       Texas law also does little to limit the policies’ expansive definition of\n“advertisement.” In Sport Supply Grp., Inc. v. Columbia Cas. Co., 335 F.3d 453\n(5th Cir. 2003), we summarized Texas law on the subject:\n               The Texas Supreme Court, in another context, adopted\n               the following definition of “advertise”:\n                      To    advise,   announce,    apprise,\n                      command, give notice of, inform,\n                      make known, publish.

App.—Austin\n               1993, writ denied). The Texas Supreme Court\n               further indicated that “advertising” is a\n               “marketing device[] designed to induce the\n               public to patronize” a particular establishment.\n               Smith, 611 S.W.2d at 615; see id. (suggesting that\n               “advertising” is “a public notice drawing\n               attention to” the attributes of a business).The\n               Texas Supreme Court’s definition of “advertising”\n               would seem to accord with our common understanding\n               of the term as referring to a device for the solicitation\n               of business. See Frog, Switch & Mfg. Co. v. Travelers\n               Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 748 (3d Cir. 1999). . . . 18\n      In this case, it is undisputed that Hallmark’s primary means of\nmarketing its construction business was through the use of the homes\nthemselves, both through model homes and yard signs on the property of\ninfringing homes it had built, all of which were marketed to the general public.\nMid-Continent even contends there is no evidence that Hallmark’s customers\nsaw any marketing materials other than the houses themselves. Under the\nundisputed facts, Hallmark’s use of the infringing houses satisfies not only the\npolicies’ expansive definition of “advertisement” and Texas law’s similarly\n\n\n\n      18   335 F.3d at 462-63 (emphasis added).\n                                             13\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594          Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\nbroad construction of the term but also common sense. 19 We therefore conclude\nthat the infringing houses in this case, as used by Hallmark, all qualify as\n“advertisements” under the policies. 20\n       C.     Hallmark’s Liability In The Prior Judgment Was “Because\n              Of” A Covered Advertising Injury.\n       The policies provide that Mid-Continent “will pay those sums that the\ninsured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘personal and\nadvertising injury,’” which the policy defines as “injury . . . arising out of one\nor more of the following offenses: . . . infringing upon another’s copyright, trade\ndress or slogan in your ‘advertisement.’” Because we conclude that Hallmark\ninfringed KFA’s copyright in its advertisement, the policies define the resulting\ninjury as an “advertising injury,” i.e., an injury arising out of the infringement\nin the advertisement. KFA’s judgment against Hallmark therefore is because\nof that advertising injury. Under the plain language of the policy, Mid-\nContinent owes a duty to indemnify.\n\n\n\n\n       19  We have found one other case that addressed the use of homes in the “advertising\ninjury” context, and it, too, found that such marketing triggered coverage. See King v. Cont’l\nW. Ins. Co., 123 S.W.3d 259, 265 (Mo. Ct. App. 2003) (noting that “one of the best ways to\nadvertise the goods and services of a building constructor is to put signs outside of\nconstruction sites so that potential customers can tie the quality of workmanship to the\nbuilder” and that “[a] contractor putting its sign up next to the home it is building, without\nstating so, is placing it there to attract the attention of potential homebuyers.”).\n        20 We are not swayed by Mid-Continent’s argument that the policy excludes coverage\n\nfor Hallmark’s marketing activities because advertising necessarily is an activity or item\ndistinct from the product being advertised. See Ekco Group, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co. of\nIll., 273 F.3d 409 413 (1st Cir. 2001) (“Although the term ‘advertising’ has a range of\nmeanings, the one that leaps to mind in reading this policy is what is surely the most common\nuse: as a reference to advertising in newspaper, radio, television, or other familiar media\nwhere the advertisement is an activity or item distinct from the product being advertised.”);\nand Krueger Int’l, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 647 F. Supp. 2d 1024, 1035 (E.D. Wis. 2009)) (citing\ncases for that proposition). These cases do not take into account the facts peculiar to\nHallmark’s business and the broad policy language at issue here. Here, the use of the homes\nunquestionably was Hallmark’s primary—indeed, nearly only—means of marketing its\nservices.\n                                             14\n\f   Case: 14-50649        Document: 00512950594      Page: 15   Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n               No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n      Mid-Continent argues that the district court applied the wrong causation\nstandard to draw a link between the prior judgment and coverage under the\npolicies, but Mid-Continent has not offered any reasonable construction of the\npolicy language that would preclude coverage. Mid-Continent also argues that\nto prove an “advertising injury,” a plaintiff must prove that the infringing\nadvertisement swayed a particular buyer’s decision, but the policies do not\ncontain such a requirement, and we find no case law to support that\nproposition.\n      D.       KFA Is Not Barred From Recovery Under The Concurrent\n               Causation Doctrine.\n      Mid-Continent argues that even if the houses are treated as\n“advertisements,” the damages award in the prior judgment included both\ncovered “advertising injury” damages (for the infringement in Hallmark’s\nadvertisements, including the use of model homes) and non-covered damages\nfor infringement in the construction and sale of the houses themselves. Thus,\nMid-Continent argues, all of the damages are barred under the concurrent\ncausation doctrine, citing Utica, supra. The argument is without merit because\neven assuming arguendo that we were to find two distinct kinds of\ninfringement in the prior judgment, the damages would not be subject to the\nconcurrent causation doctrine.\n      In Utica, the Texas Supreme Court explained:\n               Texas courts and the Fifth Circuit applying Texas law\n               have recognized a distinction between cases involving\n               “separate     and    independent”     causation       and\n               “concurrent” causation when both covered and covered\n               [sic] and excluded events cause a plaintiff’s injuries. In\n               cases involving separate and independent causation,\n               the covered event and the excluded event each\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f    Case: 14-50649      Document: 00512950594    Page: 16    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                 No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n             independently cause the plaintiff’s injury, and the\n             insurer must provide coverage despite the exclusion. 21\nAmong other examples of the separate and independent causation doctrine, the\ncourt cited Guaranty Nat’l Ins. Co. v. North River Ins. Co., 909 F.2d 133, 137\n(5th Cir. 1990), in which we held that a patient’s suicide was proximately\ncaused by both a hospital’s failure to secure its windows and its failure to\nsupervise the patient, such that an exclusion under the policy for liability “due\nto . . . the rendering of or failure to render . . . any service or treatment\nconducive to health or of a professional nature. . .” did not apply. 22\n      The Texas Supreme Court explained, on the other hand, that\n             [i]n cases involving concurrent causation, the excluded\n             and covered events combine to cause the plaintiff’s\n             injuries. Because the two causes cannot be separated,\n             the exclusion is triggered. See Travelers Indem. Co. v.\n             Citgo Petroleum Corp., 166 F.3d 761, 771–72 (5th Cir.\n             1999) (holding that, under Texas law, liability for\n             failing to follow separate corporate safety standards\n             was necessarily derivative of excluded negligent\n             driving claim); Burlington Ins.

Even\nif, as Mid-Continent urges, we could distinguish between copyright\ninfringement in the construction and sale of the houses and infringement in\nHallmark’s use of the houses as advertisements, copyright law does not\ndistinguish between those infringements for purposes of damages. Under 17\nU.S.C. § 504, KFA was entitled to choose between either actual damages and\nprofits (subsection (b)) or statutory damages (subsection (c)) for each\ninfringement. KFA ultimately was awarded actual damages in the prior\njudgment under § 504(b):\n                 (b) Actual Damages and Profits.--The copyright\n                 owner is entitled to recover the actual damages\n                 suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement,\n                 and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to\n                 the infringement and are not taken into account in\n                 computing the actual damages. In establishing the\n                 infringer’s profits, the copyright owner is required to\n                 present proof only of the infringer’s gross revenue, and\n                 the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible\n                 expenses and the elements of profit attributable to\n                 factors other than the copyrighted work. 24\n        In essence, copyright law would have granted KFA the full recovery for\nany type of infringement. There is no correlation between one type of\ninfringement and any other. Because infringement in an advertisement would\ngive rise to precisely the same damages as infringement by construction and\nsale, the two causes are separate and independent, and the full recovery\ntherefore is covered as an advertising injury.\nIV.     MID-CONTINENT HAS NOT ASSERTED A VIABLE DEFENSE.\n        Because we conclude that KFA has satisfied its burden of proving\ncoverage under the terms of the policies, the burden shifts to Mid-Continent to\n\n\n        24   17 U.S.C. § 504(b) (West 2012).\n                                               17\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594         Page: 18     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\nprove that an exclusion applies. 25 If Mid-Continent succeeds in doing so, the\nburden shifts back to KFA to prove some exception to the exclusion. 26 In this\ncoverage, suit, however, Mid-Continent may be barred from re-litigating an\nissue if: “(1) the issue raised in the coverage suit was raised and determined in\nthe liability suit; (2) the issue determined in the liability suit was essential to\nthe judgment in the liability suit; and (3) the necessary requirement of privity\nexists between the insurer and the insured.” 27 It is clear that Mid-Continent\nwas in privity with Hallmark for the liability issues (i.e., whether or not\nHallmark committed copyright infringement) but was not in privity with\nrespect to coverage issues.\n       A.     Mid-Continent Has Failed To Prove That The Breach Of\n              Contract Exclusion Applies.\n       Mid-Continent relies on the rule that if an exclusion is even incidentally\nrelated to conduct that would otherwise be covered, the exclusion trumps. 28\nMid-Continent first points to the policies’ breach of contract exclusion, which\nprovides:\n              f. Breach of Contract\n              “Personal and advertising injury” arising out of a\n              breach of contract, except an implied contract to use\n              another’s advertising idea in your “advertisement”.\n       Mid-Continent relies on the fact that KFA and Hallmark had entered\ninto at least three architectural services agreements. It argues that Hallmark’s\nfailure to prepay for the reuse licenses of KFA’s designs constituted a breach\nof contract. Mid-Continent relies on the testimony of KFA’s representative at\n\n\n\n       25 Gilbert Texas Const., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, 327 S.W.3d 118, 124\n(Tex. 2010).\n       26 Id.\n       27 Mid-Continent Cas. Co. v. Bay Rock Operating Co., 614 F.3d 105, 110 (5th Cir. 2010)\n\n(Bay Rock).\n       28 Mid-Continent cites Sport Supply, supra; and Gemini Ins. Co. v. The Andy Boyd Co.\n\nLLC, 243 F. App’x 814, 815 (5th Cir. 2007).\n                                             18\n\f   Case: 14-50649    Document: 00512950594      Page: 19   Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\ntrial that Hallmark failed to follow the contract’s requirement to notify KFA of\nits intent to reuse KFA’s designs.\n      In the prior suit, KFA stated a claim only for copyright infringement, not\nbreach of contract, and neither KFA nor Hallmark argued in the prior trial\nthat Hallmark breached the agreements. KFA contended that the\nconsequences of Hallmark’s failure to secure a reuse license were already\naddressed in the agreements themselves by stipulating that Hallmark’s\nlicenses would lapse. Notwithstanding the agreements’ provisions terminating\nits licenses, Hallmark argued unsuccessfully that KFA never terminated the\nagreements, so it had granted Hallmark an implied license to continue using\nKFA’s designs. The agreements provided, in relevant part:\n            Client’s failure to pay all charges for services\n            requested by Client, including fees for purchase of\n            license for reuse of plan(s), shall make this granting of\n            the right to reuse plan(s) null and void. Client’s right\n            to reuse plans lapses if Client fails to report\n            construction and remit payment for license for a period\n            of one year, or fails to report construction for\n            application of prepaid license fees for a period of one\n            year.\n      The entire prior suit was based on copyright infringement, which could\nonly have arisen after the clause stripped Hallmark of its license. All of the\ndamages in the prior judgment arose under copyright law, not breach of\ncontract law. These facts, coupled with the fact that neither KFA nor Hallmark\never argued there was a breach of contract, suggest that the prior judgment\nwas not related to breach of contract. We conclude that Mid-Continent has\nfailed to carry its burden of proving that the breach of contract exclusion\napplies.\n      B.    Mid-Continent Has Failed To Prove That The “Prior\n            Publication” Exclusion Applies.\n      Mid-Continent also argues that the “prior publication” exclusion applies:\n\n                                       19\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594        Page: 20     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n              c. Material Published Prior To Policy Period\n              “Personal and advertising injury” arising out of oral or\n              written publication of material whose first publication\n              took place before the beginning of the policy period.\n       Mid-Continent claims that the purpose of the exclusion is to preclude\ncoverage where the risk had already materialized prior to the beginning of\ncoverage. There is some question as to whether the exclusion would apply to a\nstring of distinct acts of copyright infringement, as opposed to the situation\nwhere an advertisement was published prior to the policy period but continued\nto give rise to harm afterward. 29 We need not address that issue here, however,\nbecause under the broadest interpretation, Mid-Continent has failed to carry\nits burden of proving the exclusion applies.\n       The first policy period began on May 28, 2004. Mid-Continent has not\npointed to any infringement or other advertising injury prior to that date. Mid-\nContinent asserts, for example, that KFA provided artwork for a certain house\nplan, the Versailles model, in 2003, and that Hallmark began using it in\nbrochures that were available in model homes within a month. It also points\nto the fact that Hallmark put the Versailles plan on its website prior to May\n28, 2004. The record also shows that the Versailles model was first built or sold\non January 13, 2004. The record reveals was no other home built prior to May\n28, 2004. Because Hallmark retained its license until it built the second copy\nof the home without a reuse license, none of the pre-policy conduct infringed\nKFA’s copyright. Even under a broad construction of the “prior publication”\nexclusion, Mid-Continent has not carried its burden of proving that any\n“advertising injury” occurred prior to the first policy period.\n\n\n\n\n       See, e.g., Ryland Grp., Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co. of IL, No. CIV. A-00-CA-233 JRN,\n       29\n\n2000 WL 33544086, at *8 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 25, 2000) (footnotes omitted) (discussing cases).\n                                            20\n\f    Case: 14-50649        Document: 00512950594   Page: 21    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n               No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n      Next, Mid-Continent argues that the prior publication exclusion applies\nto each infringing advertisement within the policy periods, so Mid-Continent\nis not liable to pay under later policy periods for advertisements that were first\npublished under earlier policy periods. Because the five insurance agreements\nare virtually identical and Mid-Continent remained the insurer throughout,\nMid-Continent still would be liable for the consequences of the advertising\ninjuries, all of which began during a covered period. Mid-Continent has shown\nno reason why the distinction would make a difference. In sum, the “prior\npublication” exclusion does not apply to these facts.\n      C.       Mid-Continent Is Not Entitled To Assert A Defense To The\n               Copyright Infringement Because The Issue Of Copyright\n               Infringement Was Adjudicated In The Prior Suit.\n      Next, Mid-Continent argues that, under § 120(a) of the Architectural\nWorks Copyright Protection Act, 17 U.S.C. § 120(a), Hallmark’s use of KFA’s\ndesigns did not actually constitute copyright infringement. Even though the\nprior case involved copyright infringement, Mid-Continent claims it is not\nbarred from litigating this issue now because it is a “coverage defense.”\n      In connection with coverage, Mid-Continent cannot ignore or relitigate\nfacts actually established in the prior liability case. 30 The jury in the prior suit\nspecifically determined that Hallmark infringed KFA’s copyright. Because\nMid-Continent’s § 120(a) defense would require the court to overturn that\nfinding, Mid-Continent may not assert it.\n      D.       KFA Sufficiently Established The Amount Of Its Damages.\n      Mid-Continent argues that the policies cover when offenses occur and\nnot when sales occur, so KFA cannot recover unless it ties each particular\noffense to one of the five policy periods rather than treating them as one five-\nyear policy. As established above, Mid-Continent has not pointed to any offense\n\n\n\n      30   Bay Rock, 614 F.3d at 110.\n                                         21\n\f     Case: 14-50649     Document: 00512950594        Page: 22    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\nthat took place prior to the first policy period. Mid-Continent also has not\nshown that KFA was awarded damages for any offense or sale that took place\nafter the policy periods. Thus, all offenses or sales for which the district court\nawarded KFA damages must have taken place within one of the five policy\nperiods. Mid-Continent was the insurer during all five policy periods. At best,\nthis argument presents a distinction without a difference.\nV.     KFA IS ENTITLED TO THE FULL AWARD OF ATTORNEY’S\n       FEES.\n       Finally, Mid-Continent argues that, even if KFA wins on the coverage\nissue and is therefore entitled to attorney’s fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode § 38.001 for breach of the insurance contract, the district court erred in\nawarding fees based on the contingency fee agreement between KFA and its\nattorneys minus a reduction for time spent outside of the breach of insurance\ncontract claim, which represents a total recovery outside of costs of 33.8%. 31\nMid-Continent argues that Texas requires lodestar evidence for attorney’s fees.\nThat is not accurate. Texas courts permit otherwise reasonable contingency fee\nawards under § 38.001.\n       Interpreting Texas law, the Fifth Circuit permitted the imposition of a\ncontingency fee in Mathis v. Exxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2002):\n             First, there is a rebuttable presumption of\n             reasonableness for fees that are “usual” or\n             “customary.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.003\n             (Vernon 2002). Second, where the fees are tried to the\n             court, as they were in this case, the statute authorizes\n             the judge to take judicial notice of the “usual and\n             customary fees” and the contents of the case file. Id. at\n             § 38.004. Texas courts have upheld fee awards using\n             these presumptions where the attorneys had a\n             contingent fee arrangement. Laredo Indep. Sch. Dist.\n             v. Trevino, 25 S.W.3d 263 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n\n        The district court awarded a net fee of $1,091,362.72, compared to the underlying\n       31\n\njudgment of $3,231,084.00, or approximately 33.8% of the judgment.\n                                           22\n\f   Case: 14-50649         Document: 00512950594         Page: 23    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                    No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n               2000, review denied) (40% contingency fee); European\n               Crossroads’ Shopping Ctr., Ltd. v. Criswell, 910\n               S.W.2d 45, 58–59 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, writ\n               denied) (upholding jury award of 35% based only on\n               attorney’s own testimony). Plaintiffs’ attorneys\n               supported their fees by submitting an affidavit drafted\n               by lead counsel and an affidavit of an attorneys’ fees\n               expert. Exxon countered by challenging the\n               reasonableness of the total award. Under Texas law,\n               the two affidavits, combined with the presumption of\n               reasonableness and the court’s ability to use judicial\n               notice to guide the reasonableness finding is enough\n               for us to conclude that the district court did not abuse\n               its discretion in awarding fees as contemplated by\n               plaintiffs’ contingency fee contract. 32\n      The Texas Supreme Court recently noted that lodestar evidence is not\nrequired for contingency fee awards but is required if a claimant wants to go\nabove the contingency fee calculation:\n               In addition to the lodestar method, the attorney’s fee\n               affidavit also indicates the Griffins and their attorneys\n               agreed to a 35% contingency fee arrangement, which\n               the affidavit claims is reasonable and customary for\n               such a suit. Even if supporting evidence is not required\n               for the contingency fee method of proof (as it is for the\n               lodestar method), the contingency fee method cannot\n               support the trial court’s fee award here because the\n               final judgment awarded no monetary relief except for\n               attorney’s fees. Because the contingency fee method\n               cannot support the trial court’s fee award, and no\n               legally sufficient evidence supports the award under\n               the lodestar method, we remand to redetermine\n               attorney’s fees. 33\n      Mid-Continent’s argument rests entirely on the proposition that KFA\nfailed to submit lodestar evidence. Because Texas law does not require lodestar\nevidence for contingency fee arrangements and because Mid-Continent has not\n\n\n      32   Id. at 462 (footnote omitted).\n      33   Long v.

BACKGROUND 2\n       KFA is an architecture firm that designs homes and then licenses those\ndesigns to other companies to build. Hallmark, a homebuilder in the Houston,\nTexas area, entered into several architectural services and license agreements\nwith KFA. Under these agreements, KFA agreed to supply Hallmark with 11\ndifferent house designs, each of which Hallmark was authorized to build once.\nIf Hallmark wished to build any copy after that first licensed copy, it was\nrequired to pay KFA in advance for a license. Under the agreements,\nHallmark’s failure to pay for a license for reuse of a plan rendered null and\nvoid KFA’s grant of the right to reuse it.\n       After building the first licensed copy of each of the 11 house plans,\nHallmark built several hundred more copies without paying KFA. When KFA\ndiscovered Hallmark’s actions, it sued Hallmark for copyright infringement,\nseeking actual damages or, in the alternative, statutory damages for the\n\n\n       1  Because the district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, this\ncourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n        2 Unless otherwise noted, the undisputed facts in this section come from the district\n\ncourt’s opinion, see Mid-Continent Cas.

In its Second Amended Complaint, KFA\nspecifically asserted:\n              Defendants have created, published and used non-\n              pictorial depictions of structures based on KFA’s\n              Copyrighted Works in promotional and advertising\n              materials. Defendants have published and used these\n              infringing materials in the course of advertising their\n              infringing structures. Furthermore, defendants have\n              used the structures themselves to advertise their\n              infringing structures. These infringing advertising\n              activities have resulted in the sales of infringing\n              structures described above. Furthermore, these\n              infringing advertising activities, and the resulting\n              infringing sales, are and have been a substantial\n              factor in the value of any infringing structures that\n              defendants have not yet sold, and the prices that\n              buyers would be willing to pay for such structures.\n       Hallmark filed for bankruptcy before trial, but the trial went forward\nbecause Hallmark was potentially covered by the Mid-Continent policies at\nissue in this action. The jury returned a verdict in favor of KFA on September\n12, 2012, finding that Hallmark had infringed all 11 of KFA’s designs and\nfinding the amount of profit attributable to the infringement. The district court\nentered a final judgment on October 4, 2012, establishing that Hallmark had\ninfringed KFA’s copyrights and allowing KFA an unsecured claim in\nHallmark’s bankruptcy in the amount of $3,231,084 plus taxable costs of\n$8,604.40. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 3\n       On January 23, 2012, Mid-Continent filed this action seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it had no duty to indemnify under the policies it\nissued to Hallmark. The policies, discussed in detail below, generally exclude\ncoverage for copyright infringement, but they exempt from that exclusion—i.e.,\n\n\n\n       3 Kipp Flores Architects, L.L.C. v.

The policies also provide that the\nholder of a judgment against Hallmark may recover under the policies.\n       Mid-Continent filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking a\njudgment that the policies do not provide coverage for the judgment of\ncopyright infringement for a number of reasons. Most notably, Mid-Continent\nargued that the prior judgment was not for a covered “advertising injury”\nbecause the infringement did not take place in an “advertisement” as defined\nin the policies. KFA filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment\nclaiming the policies do cover the prior judgment. The district court granted\nKFA’s motion and denied Mid-Continent’s, and it awarded attorney’s fees to\nKFA under Texas law based on KFA’s contingency fee arrangement with its\nattorneys.\n       Mid-Continent appealed both the coverage and attorney’s fees issues on\na number of grounds. For the reasons set out below, we affirm.\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.       Applicable Law And Policy Language\n       This court “review[s] a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\nnovo,” applying the usual standards under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. 4 The parties\nagree that Texas law governs this insurance dispute, so we must look to state\nlaw for the rules of policy interpretation and the burden of proof.\n                1.      Interpretation of Insurance Contracts\n\n       Texas’s rules for interpreting insurance contracts are straightforward:\n                Texas courts “construe insurance policies according to\n                the same rules of construction that apply to contracts\n                generally.” When interpreting insurance contracts,\n                courts seek “to ascertain the true intentions of the\n                parties as expressed in the instrument.” To this end,\n\n\n       4   RSR Corp. v.

If the contract “can be given a\n              definite or certain meaning as a matter of law,” courts\n              will not consider the contract to be ambiguous. A\n              provision is not ambiguous “simply because the parties\n              interpret a policy differently.” Rather, a court will find\n              a term ambiguous if “the language of a policy or\n              contract is subject to two or more reasonable\n              interpretations.” If a contract is ambiguous, such\n              ambiguity will be construed against the insurer. 5\n              2.     Burden of Proof on Coverage and Exclusions\n\n       Texas law recognizes that “the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify\n‘are distinct and separate duties.’” 6 Because Mid-Continent already paid for\nHallmark’s defense in the first suit, this suit does not concern the duty to\ndefend but the duty to indemnify.\n              While analysis of the duty to defend has been strictly\n              circumscribed by the eight-corners doctrine, it is well\n              settled that the “facts actually established in the\n              underlying suit control the duty to indemnify.” As with\n              any other contract, breach or compliance with the\n              terms of an insurance policy is determined not by\n              pleadings, but by proof. . . .\n\n\n\n\n       5 United Nat.

Evidence is usually necessary in the\n                coverage litigation to establish or refute an insurer’s\n                duty to indemnify. 7\n      The major issue in this case is whether the underlying judgment, which\nestablished that Hallmark infringed the copyrights of KFA by constructing\nhomes from KFA’s designs without a license to do so, triggered coverage for an\n“advertising injury” under the policy terms.\n                3.     Policy Language\n\n      Five successive one-year policies were in effect from May 28, 2004 to May\n28, 2009, but the relevant language is the same in each. Under COVERAGE B\nPERSONAL AND ADVERTISING INJURY LIABILITY, the policies provide:\n                a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes\n                legally obligated to pay as damages because of\n                “personal and advertising injury” to which this\n                insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to\n                defend the insured against any “suit” seeking those\n                damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the\n                insured against any “suit” seeking damages for\n                “personal and advertising injury” to which this\n                insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion,\n                investigate any offense and settle any claim or “suit”\n                that may result. . . .\n      The policies define “personal and advertising injury” as “injury . . .\narising out of one or more of the following offenses: . . . infringing upon\nanother’s copyright, trade dress or slogan in your ‘advertisement.’” Section V.1\nof the policies defines “advertisement” as follows:\n                1. “Advertisement” means a notice that is broadcast or\n                published to the general public or specific market\n                segments about your goods, products or services for\n\n\n      7   Id. at 744 (citations omitted).\n                                            6\n\f       Case: 14-50649   Document: 00512950594     Page: 7   Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n              the purpose of attracting customers or supporters. For\n              the purposes of this definition:\n                    a. Notices that are published include material\n                    placed on the Internet or on similar electronic\n                    means of communication; and\n                    b. Regarding web-sites, only that part of a web-\n                    site that is about your goods, products or\n                    services for the purpose of attracting customers\n                    or supporters is considered an advertisement.\n        Finally, the policies provide an exclusion for most copyright infringement\nexcept for infringement in advertisements:\n              2. Exclusions\n              This insurance does not apply to:\n                    i. Infringement Of Copyright,            Patent,\n                    Trademark Or Trade Secret\n                    “Personal and advertising injury” arising out of\n                    the     infringement of copyright, patent,\n                    trademark, trade secret or other intellectual\n                    property rights.\n              However, this exclusion does not apply to\n              infringement, in your “advertisement”, of copyright,\n              trade dress or slogan.\nIII.    MID-CONTINENT OWES A DUTY TO INDEMNIFY.\n        Mid-Continent argues: (a) there is no coverage because the prior\njudgment did not concern an “advertising injury” on its face; (b) KFA relied\nprimarily on the use of the houses as “advertisements,” but a house cannot be\nan advertisement under the policies; (c) KFA has not shown sufficient\ncausation under the policies; and (d) assuming it can recover at all, KFA failed\nto segregate covered damages from non-covered damages. We find no merit in\nany of these arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f     Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594         Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n       A.     The Hallmark Judgment Adjudicated The Facts Necessary\n              To Establish An “Advertising Injury” If A Model Home Can\n              Be An “Advertisement” Under The Policy.\n       Mid-Continent argues that the policy language cited above does not cover\nthe copyright infringement judgment in this case because the previous\njudgment said nothing of “advertising injury,” and the jury never had to decide\nwhether there was an advertising injury. Mid-Continent’s interpretation of the\nprior judgment is also too narrow.\n       In its order on cross motions for summary judgment, the district court\nset out the following test for determining whether a policy covers “advertising\ninjury”: “(1) the allegations in the underlying complaint must raise a ‘potential’\nfor liability under one of the covered offenses stated in the policy; (2) the\ninsured must have engaged in ‘advertising activity’ during the policy period\nwhen the alleged ‘advertising injury’ occurred; and (3) there must be a causal\nconnection between the alleged injury and the ‘advertising activity.’” 8 The\ndistrict court concluded that the Hallmark judgment directly established an\n“advertising injury” under that test because, even though the prior verdict did\nnot “identically mirror” the policy language, the prior judgment:\n              conclusively establishes Hallmark’s liability to KFA\n              for copyright infringement, including copyright\n              infringement    committed     in    connection     with\n              Hallmark’s ‘advertising.’ That is a covered offense\n              explicitly stated in Mid–Continent’s policies.\n              Additionally, the record conclusively establishes that\n              Hallmark engaged in “advertising activities” (in both\n              website and print advertising and the use of infringing\n              houses in its marketing activities) during the policy\n              periods. 9\n\n\n\n       8 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3417544</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *3 (citing Bay Elec.

The test the district court used was based on duty to defend cases, which,\nas noted above, rely on the eight-corners doctrine (i.e., the language of the\ncomplaint and the language of the policy) to determine whether the plaintiff\nhas stated a potentially coverable claim. 10 Instead, the district court should\nhave applied the duty to indemnify test set out in Horton: “The insurer’s duty\nto indemnify depends on the facts proven and whether the damages caused by\nthe actions or omissions proven are covered by the terms of the policy. Evidence\nis usually necessary in the coverage litigation to establish or refute an insurer’s\nduty to indemnify.” 11\n      That does not change the result here under de novo review, however.\nMid-Continent’s emphasis on the prior judgment’s failure to specifically refer\nto an “advertising injury” is an unduly narrow view of the “facts proven” rule.\nAs the Texas Supreme Court noted in Horton, a coverage suit often requires\nthe parties to submit evidence of facts which were not specifically covered at\nthe earlier trial. In footnote 3 of Horton, the court cited with approval a Fifth\nCircuit case applying Texas law in which this court reasoned:\n             Finally, we find that the district court properly\n             concluded that Appellees may present evidence at trial\n             regarding facts necessary to determine coverage that\n             were not adjudicated in the underlying case. The\n             underlying case often does not resolve all the factual\n             issues necessary to determine coverage because issues\n             relevant to the question of coverage can be irrelevant\n             to the question of the insured’s liability.

Otherwise, insureds . . . can never\n              establish coverage whenever there is an underlying\n              trial and an issue irrelevant to liability but essential\n              to coverage. 12\n       In this case, the issue of “advertising injury” was irrelevant to copyright\ninfringement liability but is essential to coverage under the policy. For the\ncopyright infringement claim, the jury was only required to find that Hallmark\ninfringed KFA’s copyright with respect to the 11 home designs, not to make a\nspecial finding concerning whether or not that infringement took place in an\n“advertisement” within the terms of the policy.\n       Because the jury determined that the houses themselves infringed KFA’s\ncopyright, the determinative question for coverage under the policies is\nwhether the houses themselves were “advertisements” such that the jury\nverdict potentially gives rise to coverage as an “injury . . . arising out of . . .\ninfringing upon another’s copyright, trade dress or slogan in your\n‘advertisement.’” The outcome here is determined both by the policy language\nand by the fact that KFA has presented ample evidence that Hallmark used\nthe infringing houses for marketing purposes, and Mid-Continent has never\noffered any evidence to the contrary.\n       B.     Under The Policy Terms And The Uncontroverted Facts,\n              The Infringing Houses Were “Advertisements.”\n       Even though the prior suit did not require KFA to present evidence\nconcerning advertising, KFA presented a great deal of evidence on the subject.\nKFA has always contended that Hallmark infringed KFA’s copyright in its\nadvertisements       and     that     the     structures     themselves       constituted\nadvertisements.

Indeed, on appeal in this case, Mid-\nContinent concedes that KFA presented evidence that the houses themselves\nwere Hallmark’s primary form of marketing. 13\n       One of Hallmark’s representatives testified in deposition in this suit that\nhomebuyers never bought houses sight unseen, but rather would look at the\nmodel homes Hallmark built as well as elevations and floor plans in the sales\noffice or on the website. In addition, Hallmark put up yard signs with its\ncontact information on the sites of homes it built to attract customers.\n       Mid-Continent does not dispute the fact that Hallmark used the\ninfringing homes themselves to market to customers, so we must accept that\nfact as true under Rule 56. Rather than attack the facts, Mid-Continent argues\nthat an infringing house can never be an “advertisement” under the policies as\na matter of law. Again, the policies define “advertisement” as “a notice that is\nbroadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about\nyour goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or\nsupporters.” Mid-Continent argues that, under the policy terms and common\nsense, a house cannot be a “notice,” and it cannot be “broadcast or published.”\nMid-Continent cites no controlling authority that might require the narrow\nreading proposed.\n       It is important to note that the policies never specify that “notice” must\ntake any particular form (e.g., a writing or a website) and never exclude from\nthe definition a physical object, nor do they define “broadcast” or “published.”\nAmong other things, the Oxford English Dictionary defines “notice” sweepingly\nas the “act of imparting information” or “something which imparts\n\n\n\n       13Mid-Continent also concedes that Hallmark infringed KFA’s copyright in at least\none non-house advertisement, but the bulk of its appeal focuses on whether or not the houses\nwere “advertisements” under the policies.\n                                            11\n\f    Case: 14-50649        Document: 00512950594           Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\ninformation.” 14 The few cases interpreting the policy language at issue here (“a\nnotice that is broadcast or published”) have construed “notice” very broadly. 15\nUnder the policy language, such notice need only be broadcast or published to\nqualify as an advertisement. While “broadcast” generally implies radio or\ntelevision advertisement, 16 “publish” is much more comprehensively defined as\n“to make public or generally known” or “to make generally accessible or\navailable for acceptance or use (a work of art, information, etc.); to present to\nor before the public.” 17 Thus, the policy language does not support the\nrestrictions Mid-Continent proposes.\n       Texas law also does little to limit the policies’ expansive definition of\n“advertisement.” In Sport Supply Grp., Inc. v.

Under the\nundisputed facts, Hallmark’s use of the infringing houses satisfies not only the\npolicies’ expansive definition of “advertisement” and Texas law’s similarly\n\n\n\n      18   335 F.3d at 462-63 (emphasis added).\n                                             13\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594          Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\nbroad construction of the term but also common sense. 19 We therefore conclude\nthat the infringing houses in this case, as used by Hallmark, all qualify as\n“advertisements” under the policies. 20\n       C.     Hallmark’s Liability In The Prior Judgment Was “Because\n              Of” A Covered Advertising Injury.\n       The policies provide that Mid-Continent “will pay those sums that the\ninsured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘personal and\nadvertising injury,’” which the policy defines as “injury . . . arising out of one\nor more of the following offenses: . . . infringing upon another’s copyright, trade\ndress or slogan in your ‘advertisement.’” Because we conclude that Hallmark\ninfringed KFA’s copyright in its advertisement, the policies define the resulting\ninjury as an “advertising injury,” i.e., an injury arising out of the infringement\nin the advertisement. KFA’s judgment against Hallmark therefore is because\nof that advertising injury. Under the plain language of the policy, Mid-\nContinent owes a duty to indemnify.\n\n\n\n\n       19  We have found one other case that addressed the use of homes in the “advertising\ninjury” context, and it, too, found that such marketing triggered coverage.

Mid-Continent also argues that\nto prove an “advertising injury,” a plaintiff must prove that the infringing\nadvertisement swayed a particular buyer’s decision, but the policies do not\ncontain such a requirement, and we find no case law to support that\nproposition.\n      D.       KFA Is Not Barred From Recovery Under The Concurrent\n               Causation Doctrine.\n      Mid-Continent argues that even if the houses are treated as\n“advertisements,” the damages award in the prior judgment included both\ncovered “advertising injury” damages (for the infringement in Hallmark’s\nadvertisements, including the use of model homes) and non-covered damages\nfor infringement in the construction and sale of the houses themselves. Thus,\nMid-Continent argues, all of the damages are barred under the concurrent\ncausation doctrine, citing Utica, supra. The argument is without merit because\neven assuming arguendo that we were to find two distinct kinds of\ninfringement in the prior judgment, the damages would not be subject to the\nconcurrent causation doctrine.\n      In Utica, the Texas Supreme Court explained:\n               Texas courts and the Fifth Circuit applying Texas law\n               have recognized a distinction between cases involving\n               “separate     and    independent”     causation       and\n               “concurrent” causation when both covered and covered\n               [sic] and excluded events cause a plaintiff’s injuries.

Even\nif, as Mid-Continent urges, we could distinguish between copyright\ninfringement in the construction and sale of the houses and infringement in\nHallmark’s use of the houses as advertisements, copyright law does not\ndistinguish between those infringements for purposes of damages. Under 17\nU.S.C. § 504, KFA was entitled to choose between either actual damages and\nprofits (subsection (b)) or statutory damages (subsection (c)) for each\ninfringement. KFA ultimately was awarded actual damages in the prior\njudgment under § 504(b):\n                 (b) Actual Damages and Profits.--The copyright\n                 owner is entitled to recover the actual damages\n                 suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement,\n                 and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to\n                 the infringement and are not taken into account in\n                 computing the actual damages. In establishing the\n                 infringer’s profits, the copyright owner is required to\n                 present proof only of the infringer’s gross revenue, and\n                 the infringer is required to prove his or her deductible\n                 expenses and the elements of profit attributable to\n                 factors other than the copyrighted work. 24\n        In essence, copyright law would have granted KFA the full recovery for\nany type of infringement. There is no correlation between one type of\ninfringement and any other. Because infringement in an advertisement would\ngive rise to precisely the same damages as infringement by construction and\nsale, the two causes are separate and independent, and the full recovery\ntherefore is covered as an advertising injury.\nIV.     MID-CONTINENT HAS NOT ASSERTED A VIABLE DEFENSE.\n        Because we conclude that KFA has satisfied its burden of proving\ncoverage under the terms of the policies, the burden shifts to Mid-Continent to\n\n\n        24   17 U.S.C. § 504(b) (West 2012).\n                                               17\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594         Page: 18     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\nprove that an exclusion applies. 25 If Mid-Continent succeeds in doing so, the\nburden shifts back to KFA to prove some exception to the exclusion. 26 In this\ncoverage, suit, however, Mid-Continent may be barred from re-litigating an\nissue if: “(1) the issue raised in the coverage suit was raised and determined in\nthe liability suit; (2) the issue determined in the liability suit was essential to\nthe judgment in the liability suit; and (3) the necessary requirement of privity\nexists between the insurer and the insured.” 27 It is clear that Mid-Continent\nwas in privity with Hallmark for the liability issues (i.e., whether or not\nHallmark committed copyright infringement) but was not in privity with\nrespect to coverage issues.\n       A.     Mid-Continent Has Failed To Prove That The Breach Of\n              Contract Exclusion Applies.\n       Mid-Continent relies on the rule that if an exclusion is even incidentally\nrelated to conduct that would otherwise be covered, the exclusion trumps. 28\nMid-Continent first points to the policies’ breach of contract exclusion, which\nprovides:\n              f. Breach of Contract\n              “Personal and advertising injury” arising out of a\n              breach of contract, except an implied contract to use\n              another’s advertising idea in your “advertisement”.\n       Mid-Continent relies on the fact that KFA and Hallmark had entered\ninto at least three architectural services agreements.

Co. v. The Andy Boyd Co.\n\nLLC, 243 F. App’x 814, 815 (5th Cir. 2007).\n                                             18\n\f   Case: 14-50649    Document: 00512950594      Page: 19   Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\ntrial that Hallmark failed to follow the contract’s requirement to notify KFA of\nits intent to reuse KFA’s designs.\n      In the prior suit, KFA stated a claim only for copyright infringement, not\nbreach of contract, and neither KFA nor Hallmark argued in the prior trial\nthat Hallmark breached the agreements. KFA contended that the\nconsequences of Hallmark’s failure to secure a reuse license were already\naddressed in the agreements themselves by stipulating that Hallmark’s\nlicenses would lapse. Notwithstanding the agreements’ provisions terminating\nits licenses, Hallmark argued unsuccessfully that KFA never terminated the\nagreements, so it had granted Hallmark an implied license to continue using\nKFA’s designs. The agreements provided, in relevant part:\n            Client’s failure to pay all charges for services\n            requested by Client, including fees for purchase of\n            license for reuse of plan(s), shall make this granting of\n            the right to reuse plan(s) null and void. Client’s right\n            to reuse plans lapses if Client fails to report\n            construction and remit payment for license for a period\n            of one year, or fails to report construction for\n            application of prepaid license fees for a period of one\n            year.\n      The entire prior suit was based on copyright infringement, which could\nonly have arisen after the clause stripped Hallmark of its license. All of the\ndamages in the prior judgment arose under copyright law, not breach of\ncontract law. These facts, coupled with the fact that neither KFA nor Hallmark\never argued there was a breach of contract, suggest that the prior judgment\nwas not related to breach of contract. We conclude that Mid-Continent has\nfailed to carry its burden of proving that the breach of contract exclusion\napplies.\n      B.    Mid-Continent Has Failed To Prove That The “Prior\n            Publication” Exclusion Applies.\n      Mid-Continent also argues that the “prior publication” exclusion applies:\n\n                                       19\n\f    Case: 14-50649       Document: 00512950594        Page: 20     Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                  No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n              c. Material Published Prior To Policy Period\n              “Personal and advertising injury” arising out of oral or\n              written publication of material whose first publication\n              took place before the beginning of the policy period.\n       Mid-Continent claims that the purpose of the exclusion is to preclude\ncoverage where the risk had already materialized prior to the beginning of\ncoverage. There is some question as to whether the exclusion would apply to a\nstring of distinct acts of copyright infringement, as opposed to the situation\nwhere an advertisement was published prior to the policy period but continued\nto give rise to harm afterward. 29 We need not address that issue here, however,\nbecause under the broadest interpretation, Mid-Continent has failed to carry\nits burden of proving the exclusion applies.\n       The first policy period began on May 28, 2004. Mid-Continent has not\npointed to any infringement or other advertising injury prior to that date. Mid-\nContinent asserts, for example, that KFA provided artwork for a certain house\nplan, the Versailles model, in 2003, and that Hallmark began using it in\nbrochures that were available in model homes within a month. It also points\nto the fact that Hallmark put the Versailles plan on its website prior to May\n28, 2004. The record also shows that the Versailles model was first built or sold\non January 13, 2004. The record reveals was no other home built prior to May\n28, 2004. Because Hallmark retained its license until it built the second copy\nof the home without a reuse license, none of the pre-policy conduct infringed\nKFA’s copyright. Even under a broad construction of the “prior publication”\nexclusion, Mid-Continent has not carried its burden of proving that any\n“advertising injury” occurred prior to the first policy period.\n\n\n\n\n       See, e.g., Ryland Grp., Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co. of IL, No. CIV. A-00-CA-233 JRN,\n       29\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33544086</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 25, 2000) (footnotes omitted) (discussing cases).\n                                            20\n\f    Case: 14-50649        Document: 00512950594   Page: 21    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n               No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\n      Next, Mid-Continent argues that the prior publication exclusion applies\nto each infringing advertisement within the policy periods, so Mid-Continent\nis not liable to pay under later policy periods for advertisements that were first\npublished under earlier policy periods. Because the five insurance agreements\nare virtually identical and Mid-Continent remained the insurer throughout,\nMid-Continent still would be liable for the consequences of the advertising\ninjuries, all of which began during a covered period. Mid-Continent has shown\nno reason why the distinction would make a difference. In sum, the “prior\npublication” exclusion does not apply to these facts.\n      C.       Mid-Continent Is Not Entitled To Assert A Defense To The\n               Copyright Infringement Because The Issue Of Copyright\n               Infringement Was Adjudicated In The Prior Suit.\n      Next, Mid-Continent argues that, under § 120(a) of the Architectural\nWorks Copyright Protection Act, 17 U.S.C. § 120(a), Hallmark’s use of KFA’s\ndesigns did not actually constitute copyright infringement. Even though the\nprior case involved copyright infringement, Mid-Continent claims it is not\nbarred from litigating this issue now because it is a “coverage defense.”\n      In connection with coverage, Mid-Continent cannot ignore or relitigate\nfacts actually established in the prior liability case. 30 The jury in the prior suit\nspecifically determined that Hallmark infringed KFA’s copyright. Because\nMid-Continent’s § 120(a) defense would require the court to overturn that\nfinding, Mid-Continent may not assert it.\n      D.       KFA Sufficiently Established The Amount Of Its Damages.\n      Mid-Continent argues that the policies cover when offenses occur and\nnot when sales occur, so KFA cannot recover unless it ties each particular\noffense to one of the five policy periods rather than treating them as one five-\nyear policy. As established above, Mid-Continent has not pointed to any offense\n\n\n\n      30   Bay Rock, 614 F.3d at 110.\n                                         21\n\f     Case: 14-50649     Document: 00512950594        Page: 22    Date Filed: 02/26/2015\n\n\n\n                No. 14-50649 consolidated with No. 14-50673\nthat took place prior to the first policy period. Mid-Continent also has not\nshown that KFA was awarded damages for any offense or sale that took place\nafter the policy periods. Thus, all offenses or sales for which the district court\nawarded KFA damages must have taken place within one of the five policy\nperiods. Mid-Continent was the insurer during all five policy periods. At best,\nthis argument presents a distinction without a difference.\nV.     KFA IS ENTITLED TO THE FULL AWARD OF ATTORNEY’S\n       FEES.\n       Finally, Mid-Continent argues that, even if KFA wins on the coverage\nissue and is therefore entitled to attorney’s fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode § 38.001 for breach of the insurance contract, the district court erred in\nawarding fees based on the contingency fee agreement between KFA and its\nattorneys minus a reduction for time spent outside of the breach of insurance\ncontract claim, which represents a total recovery outside of costs of 33.8%. 31\nMid-Continent argues that Texas requires lodestar evidence for attorney’s fees.\nThat is not accurate. Texas courts permit otherwise reasonable contingency fee\nawards under § 38.001.\n       Interpreting Texas law, the Fifth Circuit permitted the imposition of a\ncontingency fee in Mathis v. Exxon Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"28435\"><a href=\"/opinion/28435/mathis-v-exxon-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2002):\n             First, there is a rebuttable presumption of\n             reasonableness for fees that are “usual” or\n             “customary.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.003\n             (Vernon 2002). Second, where the fees are tried to the\n             court, as they were in this case, the statute authorizes\n             the judge to take judicial notice of the “usual and\n             customary fees” and the contents of the case file. Id. at\n             § 38.004. Texas courts have upheld fee awards using\n             these presumptions where the attorneys had a\n             contingent fee arrangement. Laredo Indep. Sch.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys\n               supported their fees by submitting an affidavit drafted\n               by lead counsel and an affidavit of an attorneys’ fees\n               expert. Exxon countered by challenging the\n               reasonableness of the total award. Under Texas law,\n               the two affidavits, combined with the presumption of\n               reasonableness and the court’s ability to use judicial\n               notice to guide the reasonableness finding is enough\n               for us to conclude that the district court did not abuse\n               its discretion in awarding fees as contemplated by\n               plaintiffs’ contingency fee contract. 32\n      The Texas Supreme Court recently noted that lodestar evidence is not\nrequired for contingency fee awards but is required if a claimant wants to go\nabove the contingency fee calculation:\n               In addition to the lodestar method, the attorney’s fee\n               affidavit also indicates the Griffins and their attorneys\n               agreed to a 35% contingency fee arrangement, which\n               the affidavit claims is reasonable and customary for\n               such a suit. Even if supporting evidence is not required\n               for the contingency fee method of proof (as it is for the\n               lodestar method), the contingency fee method cannot\n               support the trial court’s fee award here because the\n               final judgment awarded no monetary relief except for\n               attorney’s fees. Because the contingency fee method\n               cannot support the trial court’s fee award, and no\n               legally sufficient evidence supports the award under\n               the lodestar method, we remand to redetermine\n               attorney’s fees. 33\n      Mid-Continent’s argument rests entirely on the proposition that KFA\nfailed to submit lodestar evidence.
