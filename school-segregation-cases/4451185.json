Master\n        agreed not to take or disclose any confidential information to\n        which she had access during her employment, but she did so\n        anyway, and received $12 million as a result. Was Master’s\n        conduct protected under the federal statute? ................................... xiii \n        Second Issue: The trial court erred granting summary\n        judgment on causation based on an incompetent affidavit not\n        made on personal knowledge that only addressed one category\n        of damages, and because the allegation in the affidavit—that\n        LHC terminated its contract with MJS due to MJS’s poor\n        performance—is contradicted by evidence that LHC did so\n        because Master used its privileged and confidential information\n        to initiate a qui tam action, thus raising a genuine issue of\n        material fact. ...................................................................................... xiii \n        Third Issue:

Master had used documents\n                               surreptitiously taken from MJS against\n                               MJS’s client in a federal qui tam action.\nCourse of Proceedings          After MJS filed this suit, Master removed\n                               it to federal district court in the Eastern\n                               District of Texas and joined MJS as a\n                               defendant in the pending qui tam action in\n                               the Western District of Louisiana. The\n                               federal court in Texas remanded this case\n                               based on the lack of any federal question. 1\n                               CR 128-37. The state trial court then\n                               stayed the case in favor of the pending qui\n                               tam action. 2 CR 197. The federal court in\n                               Louisiana dismissed Master’s claims\n                               against MJS with prejudice, 2 CR 255, and\n                               the trial court lifted its stay. The parties\n                               completed discovery and filed cross-\n                               motions for summary judgment.\nTrial Court’s Disposition      The trial court granted Master’s motion for\n                               summary judgment and entered final\n                               judgment in Master’s favor. 5 CR 773.\n\n\n\n\nBrief of Appellant MJS                                             Page xi\n\f                Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n      This is a case of first impression in the nation. Master claims, and the\n\ntrial court agreed, that the federal False Claims Act insulates her from civil\n\nliability for taking and disclosing her employer’s confidential information,\n\nsolely because that information was used to file a qui tam action. But the\n\nqui tam defendant was MJS’s client, not MJS. No court in the nation has\n\napplied the Act to protect qui tam relators from liability to third parties\n\nsuch as MJS that were not accused of committing fraud against the U.S.\n\n      By granting Master’s motion for summary judgment, the trial court\n\nhas, in effect, ruled that confidentiality agreements are ineffective against\n\nthose who wish to take confidential information from one party and initiate\n\na qui tam action against another party in the hopes of receiving large\n\nmonetary rewards. In light of the important and novel questions presented\n\nby this appeal, the Court may wish to hear oral argument.\n\n\n\n\nBrief of Appellant MJS                                                Page xii\n\f                             Issues Presented\n      First Issue: No court has ever held that the False Claims Act permits\n\na qui tam relator to steal information belonging to a party not accused of\n\nany illegal conduct and disclose it. Master agreed not to take or disclose any\n\nconfidential information to which she had access during her employment,\n\nbut she did so anyway, and received $12 million as a result. Was Master’s\n\nconduct protected under the federal statute?\n\n      Second Issue: The trial court erred granting summary judgment on\n\ncausation based on an incompetent affidavit not made on personal\n\nknowledge that only addressed one category of damages, and because the\n\nallegation in the affidavit—that LHC terminated its contract with MJS due\n\nto MJS’s poor performance—is contradicted by evidence that LHC did so\n\nbecause Master used its privileged and confidential information to initiate a\n\nqui tam action, thus raising a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n      Third Issue: The trial court erred in granting no-evidence summary\n\njudgment against MJS after MJS submitted more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence to establish each disputed element of its claims.\n\n\n\n\nBrief of Appellant MJS                                               Page xiii\n\f                               Introduction\n      This appeal raises a question of first impression in the nation.\n\n      In the three months that Master worked for MJS, she purloined\n\nMJS’s confidential, trade secret, and privileged information so that she\n\ncould file a complaint under the False Claims Act against MJS’s largest\n\nclient. As a result, MJS lost its largest client and was disparaged in the\n\nmedia, leading to further business losses. But MJS, which is in the business\n\nof auditing health care providers to ensure that they comply with\n\ngovernment regulations, did nothing wrong. Meanwhile, Master’s breaches\n\nof her confidentiality obligations allowed her to reap a reward in excess of\n\n$12 million.\n\n      When MJS sued Master under Texas law for breaching her\n\nobligations, she insisted that her conduct was protected under the Act and\n\nthat MJS was without recourse. The only court in the nation to address that\n\nquestion—the federal court that remanded this suit after Master tried to\n\nremove it—concluded that the Act has no bearing on MJS’s purely state-law\n\nclaims. Nevertheless, the trial court accepted Master’s overtures that the\n\nAct insulated her from liability and granted summary judgment. That\n\ndecision, if permitted to stand, would have a crippling effect on confidential\n\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                  Page 1\n\frelationships traditionally subject to state regulation, and this Court should\n\nreverse.\n\n                                 Statement of Facts\n\nI.    The False Claims Act Litigation Against MJS’s Client, LHC\n      A.       Attorneys for LHC Hired MJS to Perform Health Care\n               Compliance Audits\n      MJS is a healthcare consulting firm owned and operated by Jan and\n\nCharlie Spears.1 It provides a wide array of services to health care providers,\n\nincluding auditing services to ensure compliance with government\n\nMedicare and Medicaid regulations.2\n\n      LHC Group, LLC is one of the largest providers of home health and\n\nhospice services in the nation.3 In early 2005, attorneys from the Gachassin\n\nLaw Firm hired MJS to provide external compliance audits for their client,\n\nLHC Group, LLC, “to assist their legal representation and advice [to their]\n\nclient.”4 LHC provided documentation to MJS that MJS reviewed using\n\nspecially-developed, proprietary software called The Auditor.5 MJS\n\nassessed LHC’s compliance with federal and state regulations, accreditation\n\n\n\n      1   4 CR 509.\n      2   4 CR 509, ¶¶ 2-3.\n      3   4 CR 618.\n      4   4 CR 509, ¶ 4; 4 CR 517-18.\n      5   4 CR 523.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                 Page 2\n\fstandards, and agency policies and procedures. It then provided reports to\n\nthe attorneys on a secure, password-protected website.6\n\n        The contract between MJS, the attorneys, and LHC stated that all\n\ninformation provided to MJS would be confidential and subject to the\n\nattorney-client and work product privileges.7 It included a detailed\n\nconfidentiality provision. Under the terms of that provision, MJS agreed\n\nthat (1) MJS’s services were confidential and performed under the direction\n\nand control of the attorneys, (2) MJS’s reports would remain confidential,\n\n(3) MJS would provide all reports directly to the attorneys, not LHC, and\n\n(4) MJS would notify the attorneys of any third-party request concerning\n\nLHC and follow the attorneys’ directions in responding.8\n\n        With respect to the information it received from LHC, MJS agreed\n\nthat:\n\n                MJS would use the material solely for the purpose of\n                 performing services for the attorneys and LHC;\n\n                MJS and its employees would keep the material “strictly\n                 confidential”;\n\n                MJS would inform its employees of the information’s\n                 confidential nature; and\n\n\n\n        6   4 CR 523, 525.\n        7   4 CR 517.\n        8   4 CR 518, ¶ 3(a).\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                             Page 3\n\f                MJS and its employees would not disclose to any person,\n                 including any governmental entity, the fact that an investigation\n                 was taking place.9\nFinally, MJS was required to immediately inform the attorneys of any\n\nrequest for information provided by LHC, and MJS agreed not to release\n\nany information until the latest reasonable date possible.10\n\n      As a home health care provider, LHC is subject to the Health\n\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 45 C.F.R. § 160 et\n\nseq. (2013), which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health\n\ninformation and imposes penalties for violations. Because MJS received\n\npersonal health information as part of its services for LHC, it, too, was\n\nsubject to HIPAA regulations. An addendum to the contract memorialized\n\nHIPPA’s disclosure restrictions and required MJS to ensure that its agents\n\nabided by the restrictions.11\n\n      In July 2007, MJS entered a new consultancy agreement with the\n\nGachassin Law Firm that expanded the scope of MJS’s services for LHC to\n\ninclude auditing hospice records and increased MJS’s compensation.12 The\n\nnew agreement contained confidentiality provisions identical to the\n\n\n\n      9    Id. at ¶ 3(b).\n      10   Id. at ¶ 3(c).\n      11   4 CR 532-35.\n      12   4 CR 510, ¶ 6; 4 CR 543-44.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                    Page 4\n\foriginal.13\n\n      LHC’s business grew, and by 2009, LHC served five times the number\n\nof home health locations as it had when MJS began consulting for it. As\n\nLHC grew, so too did MJS.14 In April 2008, MJS again negotiated higher\n\nrates for its consulting services for LHC.15\n\n      B.        MJS Hired Master, Who Agreed Not to Take MJS’s\n                Property or Disclose Its Confidential Information\n      In March 2007, MJS hired Master, a registered nurse, to work on\n\ncompliance audits, including those for LHC.16 As a condition of her\n\nemployment, Master signed an employment agreement and a statement of\n\nconfidentiality.17\n\n      Under the employment agreement, Master agreed that all “files,\n\nrecords, documents, specifications, equipment, and similar items” relating\n\nto MJS’s business were MJS’s “exclusive property” and that she would not\n\nremove them from MJS’s premises under any circumstances without MJS’s\n\nprior written consent.18 She also agreed that upon the end of her\n\n\n      134 CR 537-38. The 2007 Agreement incorporated a HIPAA addendum, although\nno addendum appears in the record. 4 CR 542, ¶ 13.\n      14   4 CR 510, ¶ 6.\n      15   Id. at ¶ 8.\n      16   Id. at ¶ 10.\n      17   4 CR 551-54.\n      18   4 CR 551, ¶ 1.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                 Page 5\n\femployment, she would return any MJS property.19\n\n     In the statement of confidentiality, Master further agreed that:\n\n               She understood “the importance of observing strict ethical,\n                moral, and professional standards with confidentiality policies”;\n\n               She would not discuss or release any information regarding any\n                of MJS’s clients with anyone not directly associated with MJS;\n\n               She would obtain MJS’s authorization prior to releasing any\n                information obtained at MJS;\n\n               She would not disclose or discuss treatment, financial, medical,\n                or social information relating to any patients of MJS’s clients\n                without written authorization from MJS management;\n\n               She would not conduct any research to seek out information not\n                required for her assigned duties; and\n\n               These confidentiality obligations would continue after her\n                employment with MJS ended.20\n     Master quit after less than three months on the job.21 She did not\n\nprovide any notice, but simply sent an email to her supervisor stating that\n\nshe was resigning “due to personal reasons” and that she had enjoyed\n\nworking with her supervisor and the MJS team.22\n\n\n\n\n     19   4 CR 551, ¶ 2.\n     20   4 CR 554.\n     21   4 CR 556.\n     22   Id.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                   Page 6\n\f      C.    Master Secretly Copied, Took, and Disclosed MJS’s\n            Confidential Information to Start a Qui Tam Suit\n            against LHC\n      Within a month of leaving MJS, Master filed a qui tam complaint\n\nagainst LHC in federal court in the Western District of Louisiana. The qui\n\ntam action was based exclusively on confidential documents and\n\ninformation she obtained during her brief employment with MJS.23 MJS\n\nknew nothing about Master’s qui tam action.\n\n      The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3730 (West 2010), permits an\n\nindividual to bring a qui tam action—a suit on her own behalf and in the\n\nname of the federal government—against an entity the individual believes\n\nhas presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government,\n\nincluding Medicare and Medicaid health care claims.

If the suit is successful, the defendant is liable\n\nto the government for treble damages, plus a penalty between $5,000 and\n\n$10,000 for each false claim. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a).

The purloined\n\ndocuments included patient records and Auditor reports.29 She also made\n\nhandwritten notes about MJS records and conversations she allegedly\n\noverheard between MJS employees.30 She conducted internet research\n\nabout qui tam suits and contacted an attorney specializing in\n\n“whistleblower” cases.31 She took home the documents and other\n\ninformation she obtained from MJS and turned them over to the attorney\n\nand later to the government.32\n\n\n\n\n      27   1 CR 86-88, ¶¶ 48-50.\n      281 CR 88-89, ¶ 53. The complaint also accused MJS of changing answers in the\nAuditor questionnaire to reduce LHC’s non-compliance rate. 1 CR 88-89, ¶¶ 52-55.\nMaster later testified that she did not know for sure that MJS changed any of her\nanswers, but had heard that they had. She did not know how the answers were\nsupposedly changed or who had changed them. 3 CR 443, 447.\n      29   3 CR 458-59; 4 CR 577-78.\n      30   3 CR 451; 4 CR 577-78.\n      31   4 CR 576.\n      32   3 CR 441-42, 464.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                    Page 9\n\f      Master never told MJS that she suspected fraud or that she intended\n\nto file a qui tam action against LHC. She did not obtain permission to take\n\nor disclose any of MJS’s information and did not tell anyone at MJS that\n\nshe was doing so.33 But Master attached to her qui tam complaint 128 pages\n\nof confidential materials that she took from MJS to support her allegations\n\nagainst LHC.34\n\n      Master knew she was not allowed to remove any documents from\n\nMJS’s premises or to disclose any of MJS’s or LHC’s information of any\n\nkind to anyone outside MJS.35 But she argued “that went out the door when\n\n[she] suspected fraud.”36 Whether Master’s obligations to MJS did indeed\n\ngo out the door when she formed suspicions about MJS’s client is the\n\ncentral issue in this appeal.\n\n      D.         LHC Canceled Its Contract with MJS\n      Because the complaint was initially filed under seal, MJS did not\n\nknow that Master took documents before she quit or that she had used that\n\ninformation to start a qui tam suit against MJS’s largest client.37\n\n\n\n      33   3 CR 458-59; 4 CR 511, 580.\n      34  4 CR 575, 579-81; 4 CR 514-15, ¶ 32.

The government eventually narrowed the subpoena to encompass\n\ndocuments related to LHC’s services to Medicare beneficiaries.39\n\n     During that time, LHC began assessing its compliance program.40 In\n\nApril 2009, it hired a new Chief Compliance Officer, Josh Proffitt.41 In June\n\n2009, Proffitt held a meeting in Atlanta to evaluate MJS’s audits, determine\n\nhow to respond to the government investigation and subpoena, and\n\ndetermine how to calculate how much LHC would have to reimburse the\n\ngovernment.42 MJS learned for the first time during that meeting that LHC\n\nhad not taken corrective action in response to MJS’s findings of non-\n\ncompliance in its auditing reports by reimbursing the government for non-\n\ncovered services.43\n\n\n\n\n     38   1 CR 115-17.\n     39   4 CR 511-12, ¶¶ 14, 20.\n     40   3 CR 433.\n     41   Id. at ¶ 2.\n     42   4 CR 511-12, ¶¶ 15-18.\n     43   4 CR 512, ¶ 16.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 11\n\f     Shortly after the meeting, on June 22, 2009, MJS responded to the\n\nsubpoena by producing the requested documents, as narrowed, to the\n\ngovernment.44 Three days later, Proffitt cancelled LHC’s contract with MJS\n\nwithout explanation and instructed MJS to terminate all services being\n\nperformed for LHC.45\n\n     According to Proffitt, LHC terminated its contract with MJS because\n\nit determined that MJS’s reports were too long, detailed, and inconsistent.46\n\nHe also claimed that “LHC would have terminated MJS regardless of\n\nwhether Judy Master filed the Complaint or whether the government\n\ninvestigated the same.”47 MJS’s owner, Jan Spears, on the other hand,\n\ntestified that LHC had never complained about the services MJS provided,\n\nnever mentioned that MJS’s reports were unduly burdensome or\n\nchallenging, and never told MJS that it was reevaluating its auditing\n\nfunctions.48\n\n\n\n\n     44   Id. at ¶ 19.\n     45   Id. at ¶ 20.\n     46   3 CR 434-35, ¶¶ 8-11.\n     47   3 CR 436.\n     48   4 CR 512-13, ¶¶ 20, 22-23.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 12\n\f       E.       Master Got Millions While MJS Nearly Went Broke\n       More than two years later, in September 2011, the government\n\nsettled its claims against LHC for $65 million plus interest.49 The\n\nagreement provided that Master would receive 19% of the settlement\n\namount, or $12.35 million plus interest, as well as over $1 million in\n\nattorney’s fees.50 But, Master did not tell the Louisiana federal court about\n\nthe settlement, so her qui tam action remained pending.51\n\n       Also in September 2011, the court unsealed the record in the qui tam\n\naction.52 Ten days later, an article about the suit and its settlement\n\nappeared in Home Health Line, a nationally-distributed health care\n\nindustry periodical.53 The article disclosed that Master initiated the suit\n\nagainst LHC and quoted extensively from her complaint.54 It also\n\ninsinuated, based on Master’s complaint, that MJS was complicit in LHC’s\n\nalleged fraud against the government, describing MJS’s purported\n\n\n\n       49   4 CR 619.\n       50   4 CR 620.\n       51   2 CR 223.\n       522 CR 214-15.

The Federal Court Rejected Master’s Argument that\n               Her Conduct Was Protected Under the Act\n      Master removed the suit to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Texas.61 The same day, she also joined MJS as a defendant in the\n\nstill ongoing qui tam action in the Western District of Louisiana, asserting\n\nclaims for retaliation under the Act62 and seeking a declaratory judgment\n\nthat the Act pre-empted MJS’s claims in Texas and protected her conduct\n\nin taking and disclosing MJS’s confidential materials.63\n\n      After removal, Master moved to dismiss MJS’s suit, or alternatively,\n\nto transfer it to the qui tam action in Louisiana. MJS moved to remand.64\n\nMaster argued that federal jurisdiction existed because MJS’s state-law\n\nclaims necessarily depended on a substantial question of federal law:\n\nwhether Master’s conduct was protected under the Act.65 She claimed, as\n\n\n\n      60   1 CR 8-24.\n      61   1 CR 122-23, 126.\n      62 Master alleged that MJS retaliated against her by instructing her to alter bills\nand harassing and discriminating against her when she complained and refused to\nparticipate in the alleged fraud involving LHC. She claimed post-termination retaliation\nbased on MJS suing her in this case. 2 CR 208.\n      63   2 CR 205, 211.\n      64   1 CR 128.\n      65   1 CR 133.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                         Page 15\n\fshe does now, that she cannot be liable for state-law claims related to her\n\nuse of documents in qui tam actions.66\n\n      The federal court rejected Master’s argument and granted MJS’s\n\nmotion to remand on April 2, 2012.67 The order explains several reasons\n\nwhy MJS’s claims do not implicate the Act:\n\n              The Act “would appear to have little bearing on whether or not\n               she—who quit her job only three months after being hired—\n               breached a confidentiality agreement”;\n\n              The Act’s purpose of preventing “harassment or retaliation\n               against would-be relators for lawful acts [] has little bearing on\n               whether Ms. Master can be civilly liable” for MJS’s claims;\n\n              This was especially true given that MJS was not the target of her\n               qui tam action;\n\n              Master did not cite any appellate decisions to support her\n               argument;\n\n              The four district court cases she cited involved preventing fraud\n               by the relator’s employer68 (not a client of the relator’s\n               employer, as here), and one of those cases seemed to contradict,\n               rather than support, Master’s argument; and\n\n              Even assuming that MJS’s claims require some reference to the\n               Act, the court was “far from convinced that the federal issue in\n               this case is substantial, rather than simply tangential.”69\n\n\n      66   1 CR 133.\n      67   1 CR 128-37.\n      68 The cases mentioned in the remand order are: U.S. ex rel.

The Louisiana court held that Master’s pre-termination\nretaliation claims were time-barred, the FCA does not recognize post-termination\nretaliation claims, and the declaratory judgment claim could not proceed in federal\ncourt on its own. 2 CR 215-21.\n      73   2 CR 223.\n      74   2 CR 255.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                    Page 17\n\f      B.       The Trial Court Accepted Master’s Argument Under\n               the Act and Granted Summary Judgment Against MJS\n      Back in Texas, the trial court lifted its stay and set the case for trial in\n\nJune 2015.75 The parties conducted discovery and filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment in May 2015. MJS moved for no-evidence summary\n\njudgment on ten of Master’s affirmative defenses, including her claims that\n\nher conduct was “protected by the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3730(h)” and that “[i]t is against public policy for [MJS] to attempt to use\n\na contractual confidentiality agreement to try to thwart the purpose and\n\neffect of the federal False Claims Act.”76\n\n      Master filed a traditional and no-evidence motion, arguing primarily\n\nthat her conduct was protected by the language of the Act and policy behind\n\nit.77 The only summary judgment evidence she presented consisted of\n\nexcerpts from her own deposition testimony and Proffitt’s affidavit claiming\n\nthat LHC did not fire MJS because of Master’s actions.78 MJS responded\n\nwith evidence consisting of other excerpts from Master’s deposition\n\ntestimony,       Spears’s      affidavit,   the   confidentiality   agreement,   the\n\nemployment agreement, the 2005 and 2007 contracts between LHC and\n\n\n      75   2 CR 256-57, 262.\n      76   3 CR 406-18; see also 3 CR 397-98, ¶¶ 3-4.\n      77   3 CR 420-31.\n      78   3 CR 433-64.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                     Page 18\n\fMJS, Master’s email resignation, the qui tam settlement agreement, the\n\ndisparaging article, an LHC corporate disclosure, and an expert report on\n\ndamages. Master did not reply.79\n\n      On June 3 and 8, the trial court held a hearing on both parties’\n\nmotions.80 It granted Master’s motions for traditional and no-evidence\n\nsummary judgment in their entirety and entered an order to that effect on\n\nJune 8.81 The trial court later denied MJS’s motion to modify the judgment,\n\nand MJS timely appealed.82\n\n                           Summary of the Argument\n      Master is attempting to escape liability for stealing her employer’s\n\nconfidential, trade secret, and privileged information and using it to her\n\nown benefit. To do so, she convinced the trial court that the Act insulates\n\nher from MJS’s state-law claims because it required her to take the\n\ninformation and give it to the government.\n\n      For the Act to preempt MJS’s state-law claims, however, Master had\n\nto overcome a presumption against preemption and meet the high\n\nthreshold of establishing that the Act made compliance with her\n\n      79   4 CR 509-644.\n      80   2 RR; 3 RR.\n      81 5 CR 773; 3 RR 45. The trial court also granted MJS’s no-evidence motion on\nMaster’s defenses of unclean hands, ratification, and failure to mitigate, but denied the\nmotion as to Master’s other affirmative defenses. 5 CR 768.\n      82   5 CR 780-83.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                         Page 19\n\fconfidentiality obligations impossible. She did neither. The Act did not, in\n\nfact, require her to do anything. And it certainly did not require her to steal\n\nprotected information from a company that was not accused of fraud, but\n\nrather in the business of preventing noncompliance. Similarly, the policies\n\nbehind the Act do not invalidate her confidentiality obligations. Courts have\n\nenforced obligations concerning confidential, trade secret, and privileged\n\ninformation, even when those obligations are owed to an alleged\n\nfraudfeasor. But no court has ever held that a qui tam relator may breach\n\nits obligations to parties not accused of fraud.\n\n      The trial court further erred in accepting Master’s argument that MJS\n\ncannot establish causation because the only evidence Master relied upon\n\n(1) was not competent summary judgment evidence, (2) did not address\n\nevery category of damages MJS seeks, and (3) is controverted by MJS’s\n\nevidence, which raises a fact issue.\n\n      Finally, the trial court erred in granting Master’s no-evidence points\n\nbecause MJS presented more than a scintilla of evidence on each of the\n\nchallenged elements. The trial court’s summary judgment should be\n\nreversed and this case remanded for trial on the merits.\n\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 20\n\f                         Argument and Authorities\nI.    First Issue: The Act Does Not Protect Master from Liability\n      for MJS’s State-Law Claims\n      Several courts have recognized that “while the FCA permits any\n\nperson to bring a qui tam suit, it does not authorize that person to violate\n\nstate laws in the process.” U.S. v. Quest Diagnostics Inc., 734 F.3d 154, 163\n\n(2d Cir. 2013) (emphasis in original); U.S. ex rel. Doe v. X Corp., 862 F.\n\nSupp. 1502, 1507 (E.D. Va. 1994); U.S. ex rel. Holmes v.

Nothing in the language of the Act creates an\n\naffirmative defense against state-law claims, especially those brought\n\nagainst the qui tam relator by a third party that has not been accused of\n\nfraud against the government.83 See 31 U.S.C. § 3730.\n\n      A federal district court in this case—apparently the only court in the\n\nnation to address this specific issue—has already rejected the notion that\n\nthe Act determines the outcome of this case. When the Texas federal court\n\nremanded this case, it stated: “Ms. Master worked for an entity that is not\n\nbeing accused of fraud, and, under Ms. Master’s theory, would essentially\n\n      83  The Act creates a private right of action, not a defense, against an entity\nbelieved to have defrauded the government or an employer who retaliates against its\nemployee for “lawful acts” the employee takes pursuant to the FCA. 31 U.S.C. §§\n3730(b)(1), 3730(h)(1). Master never accused MJS of committing fraud against the\ngovernment, and the Louisiana federal court dismissed the retaliation claim she brought\nagainst MJS after MJS sued her in this case. 1 CR 75; 2 CR 203-22.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                       Page 21\n\ffind itself without [] recourse for Ms. Master’s use of confidential\n\ninformation to prove a fraud perpetrated by another entity.”84\n\n     Nevertheless, after remand, Master continued to argue that the Act is\n\nan affirmative defense to all of MJS’s claims against her.85 The trial court\n\nerred by accepting her argument and granting summary judgment,86 and\n\nthis Court should reverse.\n\n     A.       Standard of Review\n\n     The party moving for traditional summary judgment has the burden\n\nof showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). To\n\ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, a court must\n\ntake as true all evidence favorable to the non-movant, indulge every\n\nreasonable inference in its favor, and resolve any doubts in its favor. Nixon\n\nv. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., Inc., 690 S.W.2d 546, 549 (Tex. 1985).\n\n     Whether summary judgment is warranted is a question of law, so is\n\nreviewed de novo. Cook v. Nacogdoches Anesthesia Group, L.L.P., 167\n\nS.W.3d 476, 481 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2005, no pet.). Where, as here, the trial\n\ncourt does not specify the ground on which it granted summary judgment,\n\n\n     84   1 CR 135.\n     85   3 CR 422-26.\n     86   3 RR 45.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 22\n\fthe appellant “must defeat each summary judgment ground argued by the\n\nmovant.” Id.\n\n      B.       The Act Does Not Preempt MJS’s Claims\n\n      Master argued that she cannot be held liable for MJS’s state-law\n\nclaims because the Act required her to take the documents at issue and give\n\nthem to the government, and because holding her liable would frustrate the\n\nAct’s purpose to encourage those with knowledge of fraud to come\n\nforward.87 This is really an argument that, as a matter of federal law, the Act\n\npreempts MJS’s state-law claims.88 That argument should be rejected.\n\n      The preemption doctrine bars state-law claims under certain limited\n\ncircumstances because “a court may not hold a civil defendant liable under\n\nstate law for conduct federal law requires.” Mut. Pharm. Co., Inc. v.\n\nBartlett, ___ U.S. ___, 133 S. Ct. 2466, 2476-77 (2013). Courts must begin\n\nwith a presumption that Congress did not intend to preempt claims arising\n\nunder state law. MCI Sales & Serv., Inc. v. Hinton, 329 S.W.3d 475, 489\n\n(Tex. 2010); Graber v. Fuqua, 279 S.W.3d 608, 611 (Tex. 2009).\n\n      A party arguing for preemption must therefore meet “a high\n\nthreshold,” particularly when state and federal law have co-existed in a\n\n      87   3 CR 423-25.\n      88  In the Louisiana federal court, Master also sought a judicial declaration that\nMJS’s claims were preempted by federal law, but that claim was dismissed along with\nher retaliation claims. 2 CR 205.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                        Page 23\n\fgiven field for a long period of time. Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v.\n\nWhiting, 563 U.S. 582, 131 S. Ct. 1968, 1985 (2011). In such circumstances,\n\nCongress has had the opportunity to expressly preempt state law, but\n\nchosen not to, and the Supreme Court will give little to no deference even to\n\na federal agency’s opinion that state laws interfere with its objectives.\n\nWyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 580-81 (2009).\n\n      Preemption is implied when compliance with both state and federal\n\nlaw is impossible, or where “state law obstructs accomplishing and\n\nexecuting Congress’ full purposes and objectives.”89 BIC Pen Corp. v.\n\nCarter, 251 S.W.3d 500, 504 (Tex. 2008) (quoting Great Dane Trailers,\n\nInc. v. Estate of Wells, 52 S.W.3d 737, 743 (Tex. 2001)). “Courts must\n\ncautiously approach this interpretive task lest it become a ‘free wheeling\n\njudicial inquiry into whether a state law is in tension with federal\n\nobjectives,’ which ‘undercuts the principle that it is Congress rather than\n\nthe courts that pre-empts state law.’” MCI, 329 S.W.3d at 483 (quoting\n\nGade v. Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 111 (1992) (Kennedy,\n\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)).\n\n\n\n      89  Preemption may be express, Arizona v. U.S., ___ U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 2492,\n2500-01 (2012), but the Act does not explicitly preempt state-law claims. It may also be\nimplied where Congress evidences an intent to foreclose state regulation in an entire\nfield, such as bankruptcy, Graber v. Fuqua, 279 S.W.3d 608, 623 (Tex. 2009), but the\nAct does not purport to regulate the field of confidential relationships.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                        Page 24\n\f      For example, federal drug regulations require that the label on a\n\ngeneric drug be identical to the label on the previously-approved brand-\n\nname drug. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(v)\n\n(West 2013). But some state products liability laws would require the\n\nmanufacturer to change its label. Bartlett, 133 S. Ct. at 2476-77. It is\n\nimpossible for the manufacturer to comply with its duty under state law\n\nwithout violating federal law; therefore, the federal law prevails. Id.\n\n      On the other hand, the Supreme Court held in Wyeth v. Levine, 555\n\nU.S. 555, 568-81 (2009) that state product liability laws, which required the\n\nmanufacturer of a the drug Phenergan to warn of the risks associated with\n\ndirectly injecting the drug into a patient’s vein, are not preempted by\n\nfederal drug regulations. The Court rejected Wyeth’s impossibility\n\nargument because the FDA permits a manufacturer to supplement its\n\nlabeling application and unilaterally strengthen its warnings before\n\nreceiving official approval. Id. at 568-73; see also 21 C.F.R. §§ 314.70\n\n(c)(6)(iii)(A), (C) (2015).\n\n      Requiring Master to abide by her contractual, fiduciary, and related\n\nobligations under state law does not make compliance with the False\n\nClaims Act impossible. The case law is clear that “[c]onflict preemption\n\nrequires complete impossibility—not mere inconvenience or hardship.”\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                   Page 25\n\fPatriotic Veterans, Inc. v. Indiana, 736 F.3d 1041, 1050 (7th Cir. 2013); see\n\nalso Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 568-73. The Act does not require or even authorize\n\na person to obtain evidence by unlawful means. It does not require or\n\nauthorize a person to disclose her employer’s confidential and proprietary\n\ninformation to third parties90 for use against the employer’s client. In fact,\n\nit does not require someone who suspects fraud against the government to\n\ncome forward in the first place; it merely authorizes one to do so. As one\n\ncourt aptly concluded:\n\n      The Act permits “a person” to file a qui tam suit; it does not\n      require him to do so. Nor does the Act immunize a relator for\n      actions taken in pursuance of a qui tam action that violate state\n      law.\nU.S. ex rel. Doe v. X Corp., 862 F. Supp. 1502, 1507 (E.D. Va. 1994).\n\n      Rather, the Act provides that if a person suspects fraud against the\n\ngovernment, if that person wishes to file a complaint on the government’s\n\nbehalf, and if that person hopes to share in the proceeds of any settlement\n\nor judgment, then that person must provide the government with relevant\n\nevidence and information in that person’s possession. 31 U.S.C. §§\n\n3730(b)(1)-(2), 3730(d). But Master only obtained possession of the\n\n      90  Master repeatedly states that she only gave the documents she took from MJS\nto her attorneys and the government, and that it was not made available to the public.\nE.g., 3 CR 421, 425. That does not show she complied with her confidentiality\nobligations. Her attorneys and the government are third parties to her confidentiality\nagreement with MJS, so disclosure to them without authorization violated her\nobligations.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                      Page 26\n\fdocuments and information she disclosed to her attorneys and the\n\ngovernment by stealing them from MJS, in breach of her agreements with\n\nMJS and her fiduciary duty to MJS.\n\n      The Court should also reject Master’s argument that holding her to\n\nher confidentiality obligations would thwart Congress’s purpose of\n\nincentivizing individuals with knowledge of fraud to come forward. In\n\nGraber v. Fuqua, 279 S.W.3d 608, 616-17 (Tex. 2009), the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt rejected a similar argument that malicious prosecution claims\n\npremised on bankruptcy litigation are preempted because they would\n\n“change the incentives for participation in bankruptcy.” The False Claims\n\nAct includes several incentives for individuals to bring qui tam actions,\n\nincluding monetary rewards and protection from retaliation. But unbridled\n\nauthority to steal information from parties not accused of fraud is not an\n\nincentive Congress chose to include. “To effectuate a change in this result\n\n[], Congress must speak more clearly than it has.” Id. at 617.\n\n      In the 150 years since Congress enacted the Act, it has never expressly\n\npermitted qui tam relators to take and use confidential information in\n\nviolation of state laws. Meanwhile, Congress enacted retaliation provisions\n\nin 1986 that affect state laws concerning at-will employment. See 31 U.S.C.\n\n§3930(h); Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. U.S. ex rel.\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 27\n\fWilson, 559 U.S. 280, 309 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). “The case for\n\nfederal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has indicated its\n\nawareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has\n\nnonetheless decided to stand by both concepts.” Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 575\n\n(quoting Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141,\n\n166–167 (1989)).\n\n      No court has considered it necessary to abrogate the rights of parties\n\nnot accused of wrongdoing in order to incentivize individuals to gather\n\nevidence of fraud. To the extent the trial court’s judgment rests on a finding\n\nof preemption, it should be reversed.\n\n      C.       Federal Policy Does Not Clearly Outweigh the Interests\n               in Enforcing Master’s Agreements with MJS\n      The trial court also erred if it accepted Master’s argument that “any\n\nconfidentiality agreement under state law has to give way to the federal\n\npublic policy [behind the Act] and the federal common law.”91 Because she\n\nhas not identified any federal policy other than the Act itself, Master’s\n\npolicy argument is no different than her preemption argument, and it fails\n\nfor similar reasons.\n\n      Under federal law, a private agreement is unenforceable on public\n\npolicy grounds only if “the interest in its enforcement is clearly outweighed\n\n      91   3 RR 8; see also 3 CR 420-21, 425-26.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 28\n\fby a public policy against such terms.” Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480\n\nU.S. 386, 392 (1987). Courts must therefore analyze not only the effect of\n\nthe agreement at issue on a federal policy, but also interests that are served\n\nby enforcing the agreement. Id. at 397-98. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\ncautioned against invalidating private agreements on policy grounds:\n\n      Public policy . . . is a term of vague and uncertain meaning,\n      which it pertains to the law-making power to define, and courts\n      are apt to encroach upon the domain of that branch of the\n      government if they characterize a transaction as invalid because\n      it is contrary to public policy, unless the transaction\n      contravenes some positive statute or some well-established rule\n      of law.\nLawrence v. CDB Servs., Inc., 44 S.W.3d 544, 553 (Tex. 2001) (quoting\n\nSherrill v. Union Lumber Co., 207 S.W. 149, 153–54 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nBeaumont 1918, no writ)).\n\n            1.    Master’s Confidentiality Obligations             Do    Not\n                  Negate the Policies Behind the Act\n      The federal policies behind the Act are to discourage fraud against the\n\ngovernment and encourage insiders with knowledge of fraud to come\n\nforward. U.S. v. Northrop Corp., 59 F.3d 953, 963 (9th Cir. 1995). Some\n\nfederal district courts in other jurisdictions, but no appellate courts, have\n\nrelied on these policies to invalidate confidentiality agreements, but only\n\nwhen the party seeking to enforce the agreement is the one accused of\n\nfraud.\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 29\n\f      In U.S. ex rel. Head v. Kane Co., 668 F. Supp. 2d 146, (D.D.C. 2009),\n\nfor example, the court dismissed the qui tam defendant’s counterclaim for\n\nbreach of a separation agreement, stating:\n\n      Enforcing a private agreement that requires a qui tam plaintiff\n      to turn over his or her copy of a document, which is likely to be\n      needed as evidence at trial, to the defendant who is under\n      investigation would unduly frustrate the purpose of the [Act].\nId. at 152 (emphasis added). And in X Corp. v. Doe, 805 F. Supp. 1298,\n\n1310 n. 24 (E.D. Va. 1992), aff'd, Under Seal v. Under Seal, 17 F.3d 1435\n\n(4th Cir. 1994), the court preliminarily enjoined a company’s former in-\n\nhouse counsel from disclosing confidential documents, but noted that\n\npublic policy precluded the company from relying on its confidentiality\n\nagreement “to conceal illegal activity.”92\n\n      The Ninth Circuit noted in Cafasso, U.S. ex rel. v. Gen. Dynamics C4\n\nSys., Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1062 (9th Cir. 2011), that a public policy\n\nexception to enforcing confidentiality agreements may have “some merit”\n\nunder the Act. But it declined to adopt an exception under the facts of the\n\ncase, where the defendant had accused the relator of taking thousands of\n\nconfidential documents. Id. It explained that “[t]he need to facilitate valid\n\n\n      92  The general counsel subsequently initiated a qui tam action, which the\ncompany and the government settled, and the court disqualified the general counsel\nfrom serving as relator because his complaint relied on information and documents\nobtained in violation of his confidentiality obligations. Doe, 862 F. Supp. at 1503, 1509-\n10.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                         Page 30\n\fclaims does not justify the wholesale stripping of a company’s confidential\n\ndocuments.” Id. With Cafasso as their only appellate guidance, other courts\n\nhave recognized a possible policy exception but permitted counterclaims for\n\nbreach of contract when some of the confidential documents at issue might\n\nnot be relevant to the qui tam complaint.93 E.g., U.S. ex rel. Rusher v.\n\nOmnicare, Inc., No. 4:08-cv-3396, 2015 WL 4389589, at *5 (S.D. Tex. July\n\n15, 2015); Walsh v. Amerisource Bergen Corp., CIV.A. 11-7584, 2014 WL\n\n2738215, at *7 (E.D. Pa. June 17, 2014); Siebert v. Gene Sec. Network, Inc,\n\n11-CV-01987-JST, 2013 WL 5645309, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 16, 2013).\n\n      Still other courts have permitted counterclaims related to the taking\n\nof confidential information without discussing the agreements’ implications\n\non public policy. In a retaliation suit under the Act, the Fourth Circuit held\n\nthat the former employee breached nondisclosure agreements by taking the\n\ncompany’s confidential information without its consent and disclosing it to\n\nhis attorneys. Zahodnick v. Int'l Bus. Machines Corp., 135 F.3d 911, 915\n\n(4th Cir. 1997). And the district court in U.S. ex rel. Mossey v. Pal-Tech,\n\nInc., 231 F. Supp. 2d 94, 99 (D.D.C. 2002) permitted counterclaims for\n\nviolation of Virginia's Uniform Trade Secrets Act and breach of contract\n\nresulting from the disclosure and retention of confidential information.\n\n      93 It is not known whether Master took more documents and information than\nshe included in her qui tam disclosures.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                 Page 31\n\f     No court has held that an agreement between a qui tam relator and a\n\nthird party to the qui tam suit is void for public policy, and this Court\n\nshould not be the first to do so. As the federal court held in remanding this\n\ncase, any relationship between MJS’s claims and the policies behind the Act\n\nare attenuated at best.94 MJS did not commit fraud against the government,\n\nand is not invoking its agreements with Master in an attempt to conceal its\n\nown wrongdoing. Refusing to enforce those agreements would not,\n\ntherefore, discourage fraud. Nor would it discourage true insiders—\n\nemployees or agents of the purported fraudfeasor—from providing the\n\ngovernment with evidence of fraud they lawfully obtain.\n\n              2.      The Interests in Enforcing Master’s Agreements\n                      Are Compelling\n      The interests in enforcing Master’s agreements with MJS, which\n\nimplicate a number of protected relationships, greatly outweigh the policy\n\nconcerns behind the Act. LHC’s patients’ information was protected under\n\nHIPAA,95 45 C.F.R. § 160 et seq., and the information MJS received from\n\nLHC was protected not only under HIPAA, but by the attorney-client\n\nprivilege. MJS was, in fact, an agent of LHC’s attorneys and contractually\n\nagreed to keep the information it used to audit LHC strictly confidential in\n\n\n     94   1 CR 134.\n     95   4 CR 532-35.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 32\n\faccordance with the attorneys’ confidentiality duties.96 LHC’s attorneys\n\nrequired MJS to extend those confidentiality obligations to MJS employees\n\nwho had access to LHC’s information.\n\n     MJS was not the target of Master’s qui tam action, but she secretly\n\ncopied stacks of MJS’s confidential documents while still employed, took\n\nthem home, and disclosed them in the hopes of financial gain. Master not\n\nonly breached her confidentiality agreement, but jeopardized HIPAA-\n\nprotected patient information and attorney-client confidentiality, as well as\n\nMJS’s confidentiality obligations and Trade Secrets information associated\n\nwith the Auditor software.\n\n     A series of federal cases have squarely held that the Act does not\n\nexcuse disclosure of a client’s confidential information. In U.S. v. Quest\n\nDiagnostics Inc., 734 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2013), the general counsel for a\n\nclinical laboratory, responsible for all compliance matters, expressed\n\nconcerns that that the company was violating the Act and federal anti-\n\nkickback statutes and was subsequently replaced. Id. at 159-61. He then\n\njoined two other former executives and formed a partnership to bring a qui\n\ntam action against the company, using information that was otherwise\n\nprotected by his confidentiality obligations. Id. at 161. The district court\n\n\n     96   4 CR 517.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 33\n\fdismissed the complaint and disqualified the relators and their counsel\n\nfrom bringing another complaint, without prejudice to the government or\n\nother potential relators. Id. at 162-63. The Second Circuit affirmed, stating\n\nthat “[n]othing in the [Act] evinces a clear legislative intent to preempt\n\nstate statutes and rules that regulate an attorney’s disclosure of client\n\nconfidences.” Id. at 163.\n\n      Similarly, the district court in U.S. ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop\n\nGrumman Corp., 1:13CV85-HSO-RHW, 2015 WL 3504525, at *10 (S.D.\n\nMiss. June 3, 2015) held that an attorney who acted as relator “violated his\n\nduty to retain confidential information by allowing his own interest in\n\npursing this qui tam action to override his duties to [his client].” Holmes\n\nrepresented an insurance company, Munich Re, in an arbitration regarding\n\na coverage dispute and entered a confidentiality agreement covering\n\ndocuments produced by the opposing party, Northrop. Id. at *1. Holmes\n\nalso obtained documents from the Navy, purportedly for use in the\n\narbitration. Id. He then filed a qui tam complaint against Northrop based\n\non documents obtained from both Northrop and the Navy. Id. at *1-2.\n\n      Munich Re, like MJS, was not accused of fraud or joined in the qui\n\ntam action. But, Northrop moved to disqualify Holmes and dismiss the\n\ncomplaint “based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding his\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 34\n\fconduct as relator,” including his use of confidential documents. Id. at *1.\n\nThe court granted both motions, holding that Holmes violated his ethical\n\nduties by using documents obtained on his client’s behalf for personal gain,\n\nand that he breached his confidentiality agreement with Northrop. Id. at *8\n\nn. 8. The dismissal was without prejudice to the government pursuing its\n\nown action or to any other potential relators who could file a complaint\n\nwithout using documents obtained by breaching their legal and ethical\n\nobligations. Id. at *10; see also X Corp., 862 F. Supp. at 1509-10 (“Because\n\nthe complaint contains X Corp.'s confidences and secrets, which Doe has\n\nbeen enjoined under state law from disclosing, Doe cannot serve as a\n\nrelator in this action.”).\n\n      Finally, In re JDS Uniphase Corp. Sec. Litig., 238 F. Supp. 2d 1127,\n\n1135 (N.D. Cal. 2002) acknowledges that even employers who are accused\n\nof ongoing fraud may enter valid agreements to protect their confidential\n\ninformation and trade secrets. The State of Connecticut filed a securities\n\nfraud class action against JDS and was conducting investigations into the\n\nallegations, but JDS’s former employees believed they could not provide\n\ninformation to the investigators because of confidentiality agreements they\n\nhad signed during employment. Id. at 1130. Connecticut asked the court to\n\nhold that the agreements were void, at least in part, due to the policy in\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                             Page 35\n\ffavor of allowing employees to assist in securities fraud investigations. Id.\n\nat 1130, 1136.\n\n      In analyzing relevant precedent, the court noted that “[h]ighly\n\npersonal medical information is the sort of information, like trade secrets,\n\nthat a party unquestionably has the right to ask another party to keep\n\nconfidential.” Id. at 1137 (discussing Patton v. Cox, 276 F.3d 493 (9th Cir.\n\n2002)). JDS’s confidentiality agreements, however, were overly broad, so\n\nthe court limited their scope to protect only truly confidential, trade secret,\n\nand privileged information. Id. at 1137-38.\n\n      Master has not argued that her confidentiality agreements were\n\noverly broad. All of the information and documents Master stole from MJS\n\nrelated to its services for LHC’s attorneys was protected by the attorney-\n\nclient privilege.97 Master admitted that everything she took was MJS’s\n\nconfidential property.98 And the documents included MJS’s trade secrets\n\nand LHC patient information protected under HIPAA.99 Thus, both Master\n\nand MJS had heightened confidentiality obligations that did not dissipate\n\nsimply because Master suspected that LHC had engaged in wrongdoing.\n\n\n\n\n      97   4 CR 517.\n      98   3 CR 441.\n      99   3 CR 458-59; 4 CR 577-78.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 36\n\fThe trial court therefore erred to the extent it granted Master’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment based on her policy arguments.\n\nII.   Second Issue: Master Did Not Negate Causation as a Matter\n      of Law\n      In both her traditional and no-evidence motions, Master contended\n\nthat Proffitt’s declaration negated causation as a matter of law because he\n\nstated that LHC did not terminate its contract with MJS because of\n\nMaster’s actions. 3 CR 426, 430. But supporting affidavits must “be made\n\non personal knowledge.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(f). “An affidavit based on\n\ninformation and belief is insufficient as verification by oath and its content\n\nis not factual proof in a summary judgment proceeding.” Wells Fargo\n\nConst. Co. v. Bank of Woodlake, 645 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tex. App.—Tyler\n\n1983, no writ). Proffitt’s declaration is not based on personal knowledge,\n\nand he does not state that he speaks on behalf of LHC or that he personally\n\nmade the decision to terminate LHC’s contract with MJS.100 Instead, his\n\nstatements are based on “information and belief.”101 His declaration is not,\n\ntherefore, competent summary judgment evidence and cannot support\n\nsummary judgment for Master.102\n\n\n      100   3 CR 433-36.\n      101   3 CR 433, ¶ 1.\n      102   MJS objected to the declaration for lack of foundation and on the basis that\nProffitt’s statements were speculation, conclusory, and improper opinions. 4 CR 476-77.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                        Page 37\n\f      Even if Proffitt’s declaration were competent summary judgment\n\nevidence, it does not address all of MJS’s causation and damages\n\narguments. MJS alleged that Master’s actions damaged its business not\n\nonly because of the loss of LHC, but also because its current and potential\n\ncustomers fled after Master’s complaint was made public. And MJS also\n\nrequested disgorgement, which is premised on Master’s improper benefit at\n\nMJS’s expense.103 See ERI Consulting Engineers, Inc. v. Swinnea, 318\n\nS.W.3d 867, 873 (Tex. 2010) (noting that disgorgement of wrongdoer’s ill-\n\ngotten gains is equitable remedy for breach of fiduciary duty); Restatement\n\n(Third) of Restitution § 39 (2011).\n\n      The supreme court has also noted that “[i]f the credibility of the\n\naffiant or deponent is likely to be a dispositive factor in the resolution of the\n\ncase, then summary judgment is inappropriate.” Casso v. Brand, 776\n\nS.W.2d 551, 558 (Tex. 1989). That is especially true when the non-movant\n\nsubmits controverting evidence. Id. “The duty of the court hearing the\n\nmotion for summary judgment is to determine if there are any issues of fact\n\nto be tried, and not to weigh the evidence or determine its credibility, and\n\nthus try the case on the affidavits.” Gulbenkian v. Penn, 252 S.W.2d 929,\n\n931 (Tex. 1952).\n\nThe trial court overruled these objections. 5 CR 767.\n      103   3 CR 279-80, 284; 4 CR 497-98.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                 Page 38\n\f      MJS submitted controverting evidence that could lead a reasonable\n\njuror to conclude that Proffitt’s statements were self-serving and not\n\ncredible, including evidence that:\n\n           LHC terminated its contract with MJS just three days after MJS\n            provided documents to the government in response to the\n            subpoena. 4 CR 512, ¶¶ 19-20.\n\n           Over the course of the four-year business relationship, LHC\n            expanded MJS’s scope of services and twice increased its\n            compensation. 4 CR 510, ¶¶ 6, 8; 4 CR 537-49.\n\n           LHC never told MJS that it was reevaluating its auditing\n            functions. 4 CR 513, ¶ 23.\n\n           LHC never complained about the services MJS provided. 4 CR\n            512, ¶¶ 20, 22.\n\n           LHC never mentioned that MJS’s reports were unduly\n            burdensome, challenging, or contradictory. 4 CR 512, ¶ 22.\nThis evidence, based primarily on Spears’s affidavit, directly contradicts the\n\nProffitt declaration on which Master relies, and raises a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether Master’s actions caused MJS damages.\n\n      The trial court therefore erred to the extent it granted summary\n\njudgment on the basis that Proffitt’s declaration conclusively establishes\n\nthat Master did not cause injury to MJS.\n\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 39\n\fIII. Third Issue: MJS Presented More than a Scintilla of\n     Evidence to Support Each of Its Claims\n      A.    Standard of Review\n      A party may move for summary judgment without presenting\n\nevidence on the ground that there is no evidence of one or more essential\n\nelements of a claim on which the opposing party has the burden of proof at\n\ntrial. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). The burden then shifts to the non-movant to\n\nbring forth evidence that raises a fact issue on the challenged elements. Id.;\n\nThompson v. Weaver, 429 S.W.3d 897, 901-02 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2014, no\n\npet.). To do so, the non-movant need only present more than a scintilla of\n\nprobative evidence, which is evidence that rises to a level that would enable\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions as to a vital\n\nfact. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003);\n\nThompson, 429 S.W.3d at 902.\n\n      B.    Breach of Contract\n      The elements of a breach of contract action are: (1) the existence of a\n\nvalid contract, (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff,\n\n(3) breach of the contract by the defendant, and (4) damages sustained by\n\nthe plaintiff as a result of the breach. Lake v. Premier Transp., 246 S.W.3d\n\n167, 173 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2007, no pet.). Master did not challenge the first\n\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 40\n\felement.104 Though she challenged the remaining elements, she also\n\nrepeatedly admitted that she received confidential information from MJS in\n\nexchange for her employment and agreement to keep that information\n\nconfidential, and that she did not comply with her agreements.105 And MJS\n\npresented uncontroverted expert evidence of the damages it sustained as a\n\nresult of Master’s breaches of her agreements, including drastic declines in\n\nrevenue following the loss of LHC’s business and the release of the article\n\nwhen the qui tam complaint was unsealed.106\n\n      C.       Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n      The elements of a breach of fiduciary duty action are: (1) the existence\n\nof a fiduciary relationship between the parties, (2) the defendant’s breach of\n\nher fiduciary duty, and (3) either injury to the plaintiff or benefit to the\n\ndefendant resulting from the breach. Acad. of Skills & Knowledge, Inc. v.\n\nCharter Sch., USA, Inc., 260 S.W.3d 529, 540 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2008, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has held that an employee may owe\n\nfiduciary duties to her employer when acting in an agency capacity.\n\nJohnson v. Brewer & Pritchard, P.C., 73 S.W.3d 193, 200 (Tex. 2002). In\n\n\n      104   3 CR 427.\n      105   3 CR 441-42.\n      106   4 CR 586-605.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 41\n\fparticular, a fiduciary duty arises in an employment relationship that\n\nprevents an employee from using confidential or proprietary information\n\nacquired during the relationship in a manner adverse to the employer.\n\nCuidado Casero Home Health of El Paso, Inc. v. Ayuda Home Health Care\n\nServices, LLC, 404 S.W.3d 737, 752-53 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2013, no pet.);\n\nMabrey v. SandStream, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 302, 316 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2003, no pet.). The court in Cuidado Casero held that there was more than\n\na scintilla of evidence to support a breach of fiduciary duty claim where the\n\nevidence showed that an employee of a home health care agency had access\n\nto confidential patient and Trade Secrets information that she used for her\n\nown benefit in violation of a confidentiality agreement. 404 S.W.3d at 753.\n\n      Master admits receiving confidential and proprietary information as\n\npart of her employment with MJS, and admits that she took that\n\ninformation in violation of the express language of her confidentiality\n\nagreements and disclosed it to third parties.107 As a result, Master benefited\n\nat MJS’s expense by receiving over $12 million while MJS’s business\n\nsuffered.108 The trial court erred in finding that there was no evidence that\n\nMaster breached a fiduciary duty to MJS.\n\n\n\n      107   3 CR 441-42.\n      108   4 CR 620; 4 CR 586-89.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 42\n\f      D.     Tortious Interference with Contract\n      The elements of tortious interference with contract are: (1) an existing\n\ncontract subject to interference, (2) willful and intentional interference with\n\nthe contract, (3) proximate causation, and (4) actual damage or loss.\n\nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Fin. Review Services, Inc., 29 S.W.3d 74, 77\n\n(Tex. 2000). Master, however, recited the elements of tortious interference\n\nwith prospective business relations, rather than with an existing contract.\n\n3 CR 429-30. For that reason alone, she did not meet Rule 166a(i)’s\n\nrequirement that the motion “state the elements as to which there is no\n\nevidence.”\n\n      But setting that point aside, her only argument—that Proffitt’s\n\ndeclaration stating that LHC’s termination of its contract with MJS had\n\nnothing to do with the qui tam action—does not entitle her to summary\n\njudgment on MJS’s claim for tortious interference for the reasons discussed\n\nabove under issue two.\n\n      E.     Texas Trade Secrets Act\n      A person is liable for misappropriation under the Texas Trade Secrets\n\nAct if she acquires knowledge of another’s trade secret “under\n\ncircumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use”\n\nand subsequently discloses the trade secret without the owner’s consent.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 134A.002(3)(B)(ii)(b) (West Supp.\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 43\n\f2015). A trade secret under the statute is, among other things, information,\n\nincluding formulas, programs, methods, techniques, and processes that:\n\n      (A) derives independent economic value, actual or potential,\n     from not being generally known to, and not being readily\n     ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can\n     obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and\n     (B) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the\n     circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 134A.002(6). Damages for\n\nmisappropriation include unjust enrichment. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\nAnn. § 134A.004 (West Supp. 2015).\n\n     MJS’s Auditor software, the process by which Master used the\n\nsoftware to conduct compliance audits for MJS, and the reports it produced\n\nare all trade secrets within the meaning of the statute.109 The employment\n\nagreement Master signed also included the following provision:\n\n     Trade Secrets During the term of employment, Employer will\n     make available and Employee will have access to, and become\n     familiar with, various trade secrets, consisting of processes and\n     compilations of information, records, customer lists, and\n     specifications, owned by Employer and regularly used in the\n     operation of the business of the Employer. Employee shall not\n     disclose any such trade secrets, directly or indirectly, nor use\n     them in any way. . . .110\nIt is undisputed that Master took information generated by MJS’s software\n\nand disclosed it to her attorneys and the government without MJS’s\n     109   See 4 CR 523-24.\n     110   4 CR 551.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                             Page 44\n\fknowledge or consent. And Master discusses MJS’s trade secrets processes\n\nin the qui tam complaint, which is now unsealed and publicly available.111\n\n      This Court has noted that plaintiffs in trade secret cases “can seldom\n\nestablish a specific injury” to calculate lost profits, so courts use “flexible\n\nand imaginative methods” to measure damages in light of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the misappropriation. Sw. Energy Prod. Co. v.\n\nBerry-Helfand, 411 S.W.3d 581, 609 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2013, pet. granted).\n\nBoth the statute and the common law permit a plaintiff to recover for\n\nunjust enrichment associated with the misappropriation, or for the value of\n\nthe Trade Secrets at the time it was misappropriated. Id. Only by using the\n\nAuditor software was Master able to assess LHC’s compliance, which led\n\nher to form the belief that LHC was violating the Act. She then provided the\n\nAuditor information to the government and ultimately gained $12 million\n\nas a result of her misappropriation. This is sufficient evidence of damages\n\nto which MJS is entitled for Master’s misappropriation to defeat summary\n\njudgment.\n\n      F.        Conversion\n      To establish a claim for conversion, the plaintiff must prove that\n\n(1) the plaintiff owned, possessed, or had the immediate right to possession\n\n\n      111   1 CR 87.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                Page 45\n\fof personal property, (2) the defendant wrongfully exercised dominion or\n\ncontrol over the property, and (3) the plaintiff was injured. Patel v. City of\n\nEverman, 179 S.W.3d 1, 16 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2004, pet. denied). Master\n\nonly challenged the second element. Once again, she argued that the Act\n\npermitted her to take MJS’s personal property, so she did not wrongfully\n\nexercise dominion or control over that property.112 This is not a true no-\n\nevidence point, and reasons why Master’s argument is wrong are discussed\n\nabove under the first issue.\n\n      G.       Conspiracy\n      “Civil conspiracy requires a meeting of the minds between two or\n\nmore persons to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to accomplish a lawful\n\npurpose by unlawful means.” Transp. Ins. Co. v. Faircloth, 898 S.W.2d\n\n269, 278 (Tex. 1995). Master did not challenge the evidence of conspiracy,\n\nbut argued, without citing any authority, that “the sole allegation in this\n\ncause of action relates to the filing of a sealed complaint, which is protected\n\nconduct.” 3 CR 429. As discussed above under the first issue, Master’s\n\nconduct was not protected by the Act. There is also more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence that Master conspired with both her husband and her attorney to\n\nuse MJS’s confidential and proprietary information to pursue a qui tam\n\n\n      112   3 CR 428-29.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 46\n\faction against LHC,113 which was a meeting of the minds to achieve a lawful\n\npurpose by unlawful means.\n\n      H.       Fraud\n\n      Actionable fraud requires a false, material misrepresentation that was\n\neither known to be false when made or was asserted without knowledge of\n\nits truth, intent that the claimant act on the misrepresentation, and reliance\n\non the misrepresentation that caused injury. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.\n\nMeadows, 877 S.W.2d 281, 282 (Tex. 1994). Silence is the equivalent of a\n\nmaterial misrepresentation when the circumstances impose a duty to\n\nspeak, such as when there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship or when\n\nnew information makes the party’s prior representation misleading or\n\nuntrue. Four Bros. Boat Works, Inc. v. Tesoro Petroleum Companies, Inc.,\n\n217 S.W.3d 653, 670-71 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      Master argued that “[h]er conduct is protected by statute” and that\n\nthere is no evidence that she made a material misrepresentation. 3 CR 431.\n\nWe have already addressed the first assertion above under issue one.\n\nNothing in the Act protects a party from liability for its own fraud.\n\n\n\n\n      113   4 CR 576.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                 Page 47\n\f     In exchange for receiving access to MJS’s confidential and proprietary\n\ninformation, Master represented that she would not take or disclose any of\n\nthat information. In reliance on that representation, MJS provided her\n\naccess to the confidential information. Master either never intended to keep\n\nthat information confidential or failed to disclose that she changed her\n\nmind when she began making copies, contacted an attorney, and began\n\nsharing the confidential information. The trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment on MJS’s fraud claim.\n\n                                  Prayer\n     For these reasons, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to each\n\nof MJS’s claims against Master, and the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment. MJS respectfully requests that the Court reverse the\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment and remand for trial on the merits.\n\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 48\n\f                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                /s/ Michelle R.

If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a\ncivil action under this section against the person.\n\n\n(b) Actions by private persons.--(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for\nthe United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only\nif the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.\n\n\n(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses\nshall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 1 The complaint shall be\nfiled in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.\nThe Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and\nthe material evidence and information.\n\n\n(3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains\nunder seal under paragraph (2). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant\nshall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served\nupon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall--\n\n\n  (A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or\n\n\n  (B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right\n  to conduct the action.\n\n\n(5) When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related\naction based on the facts underlying the pending action.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Civil actions for false claims, 31 USCA § 3730\n\n\n\n\n(c) Rights of the parties to qui tam actions.--(1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary\nresponsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall\nhave the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).\n\n\n(2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person\nhas been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for\na hearing on the motion.\n\n\n(B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if\nthe court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances.\nUpon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.\n\n\n(C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating\nthe action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant,\nor for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as--\n\n\n  (i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;\n\n\n  (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;\n\n\n  (iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or\n\n\n  (iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.\n\n\n(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating\nthe action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court\nmay limit the participation by the person in the litigation.\n\n\n(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct\nthe action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied\nwith copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court,\nwithout limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene\nat a later date upon a showing of good cause.\n\n\n(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery\nby the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil\nmatter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing\nshall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government\nhas pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil\naction will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Civil actions for false claims, 31 USCA § 3730\n\n\n\n\n(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to\nthe Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is\npursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person\nwould have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other\nproceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding\nsentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States,\nif all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not\nsubject to judicial review.\n\n\n(d) Award to qui tam plaintiff.--(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such\nperson shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the\nproceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to\nthe prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific\ninformation (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a\ncriminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government 2 Accounting Office report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more\nthan 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the\naction in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall\nbe made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to\nhave been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded\nagainst the defendant.\n\n\n(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim\nshall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall\nbe not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of\nsuch proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily\nincurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.\n\n\n(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who\nplanned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the\ncourt considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under\nparagraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any\nrelevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising\nfrom his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive\nany share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action,\nrepresented by the Department of Justice.\n\n\n(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may\naward to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds\nthat the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of\nharassment.\n\n\n(e) Certain actions barred.--(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the\narmed forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service\nin the armed forces.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                         3\n\fIn re JDS Uniphase Corp. Securities Litigation, 238 F.Supp.2d 1127 (2002)\n\n\n\n\nLAPORTE, United States Magistrate Judge.\n\nIn this securities action, lead plaintiff Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust *1130 Funds (“Connecticut”) moves to limit\nthe scope of confidentiality agreements signed by former employees of defendant JDS Uniphase Corporation (“JDSU”). For\nthe reasons set forth below, the motion is granted, with modifications.\n\n\nI. Background\nAs lead plaintiff in this action, Connecticut has been investigating acts of JDSU and the individual defendants relating to alleged\nartificial inflation of the price of JDSU securities during the putative class period of July 27, 1999 through July 26, 2001.\nInvestigators hired by lead counsel have identified and have spoken with numerous former employees of JDSU. Many of these\nformer employees have informed the investigators that they are willing to talk about relevant activities at JDSU during the class\nperiod, but they believe they are unable to do so because of one or more confidentiality agreements that they entered into with\nJDSU (or with companies later acquired by JDSU) at the time they were hired, at the time they were terminated, or both.\n\nOne such agreement is entitled “Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.” (Gottlieb Decl., Ex. A.) That\nagreement provides, in relevant part:\n\n  (a) Confidential Restrictions. I understand that, in the course of my work as an employee of the Company, I [have had and]\n  may have access to Proprietary Information (as defined below) concerning the Company. I acknowledge that the Company\n  has developed, compiled, and otherwise obtained, often at great expense, this information, which has great value to the\n  Company's business. I agree to hold in strict confidence and in trust for the sole benefit of the Company all Proprietary\n  Information and will not disclose any Proprietary Information, directly or indirectly, to anyone outside of the Company,\n  or use, copy, publish, summarize, or remove from Company premises such information (or remove from the premises any\n  other property of the Company) except (i) during my employment to the extent necessary to carry out my responsibilities\n  as en employee of the Company or (ii) after termination of my employment, as specifically authorized in writing by a duly\n  authorized officer of the Company. I further understand that the publication of any Proprietary Information through literature\n  or speeches must be approved in advance in writing by a duly authorized officer of the Company.\n\n  (b) Proprietary Information Defined. I understand that the term “Proprietary Information” in this Agreement means all\n  information and any idea in whatever form, tangible or intangible, whether disclosed to or learned or developed by me,\n  pertaining in any manner to the business of the Company or to the Company's affiliates, consultants, or business associates,\n  unless (i) the information is or becomes publicly known through lawful means; (ii) the information was rightfully in\n  my possession or part of my general knowledge prior to my employment by the Company; or (iii) the information is\n  disclosed to me without confidential or proprietary restriction by a third party who rightfully possesses the information\n  (without confidential or proprietary restriction) and did not learn of it, directly or indirectly, from the Company. I further\n  understand that the Company considers the following information to be included, without limitation, in the definition of\n  Proprietary Information: (A) notebooks, schematics, techniques, employee suggestions, development tools and processes,\n  computer printouts, computer programs, design drawings and manuals, and improvements; (B) information about costs,\n  profits, markets, and sales; (C) plans for future development and new product concepts; and (D) all documents, books, *1131\n  papers, drawings, models, sketches, and other data of any kind and description, including electronic data recorded or retrieved\n  by any means, that have been or will be given to me by the Company (or any affiliate of it), as well as written or verbal\n  instructions or comments.\n\n(Id. at 1.)\n\nAnother such agreement is entitled “Separation Agreement and General Release.” (Gottlieb Decl., Ex. B.) That agreement\nprovides, in relevant part:\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              4\n\fIn re JDS Uniphase Corp. Securities Litigation, 238 F.Supp.2d 1127 (2002)\n\n\n\n\n  You agree to return all Company property, including, without limitation, all books, manuals, records, reports, notes, contracts,\n  lists, blueprints, and other documents, or materials, or copies thereof, and equipment furnished to or prepared by you in\n  the course of or incident to your employment. You also acknowledge and reaffirm your continuing obligations under the\n  Proprietary Information Agreement you signed with the Company on original date of hire.\n\n  ... You also agree that this Agreement is confidential and that you will not discuss it, or any of its terms, with anyone without\n  the Company's prior consent, except your spouse and to any legal or financial advisors for legitimate business reasons, or as\n  otherwise compelled by law. Further, you agree that you will not make or publish, either orally or in writing, any disparaging\n  statement regarding the Company, its employees, clients, vendors, or customers, or in any way impede or interfere with the\n  Company's customer relationships.\n\n(Id. at 2.)\n\nA third agreement is entitled “E-Tek Dynamics, Inc. Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.” (Macika Decl., Ex.\nA.) That agreement provides, in relevant part:\n\n  a. Definition Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee has obtained or may now or hereafter obtain from the\n  Company certain of the Company's confidential information, which confidential information includes but is not limited to\n  all of the Company's (i) past, present and future research, (ii) business, development and marketing plans, (iii) customer\n  lists and customer relationships, (iv) prices (except where publicly disclosed by the Company) and pricing strategies, (v)\n  secret inventions, processes, methods and specifications, (vi) compilations of information (including without limitation\n  studies, records, reports, drawings, memoranda, drafts and any other related information), (vii) trade secrets, (viii) product\n  development proposals, and (ix) other ideas, concepts, strategies, designs, suggestions and recommendations relating without\n  limitation to any of the foregoing or to any product developed or proposed to be developed by the Company or by the\n  Employee and/or others for the Company (collectively, the “Confidential Information”). Employee further acknowledges\n  and agrees that the Company is the owner of all such Confidential Information, any copies thereof, and of all copyright,\n  trade secret, patent, trademark and other intellectual or industrial property rights therein or associated therewith. Employee\n  understands and agrees that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information and any of the Company's\n  related intellectual and industrial property rights constitutes unfair competition, and promises not to engage in any unfair\n  competition with the Company during Employee's employment or at anytime thereafter.\n\n  b. Term. Employee agrees that for a period of five (5) years following either the disclosure to Employee of any of the\n  Company's Confidential Information or the termination of Employee's employment with the Company, whichever is last to\n  occur, Employee will not disclose *1132 said information or any portion thereof to any person, firm, corporation or other\n  entity, or make use of such information in any way without the Company's prior written consent, or reverse engineer, de-\n  compile, or disassemble any of the Company's products without such consent.\n\n(Id. at 1.)\n\n\nII. Discussion\nConnecticut argues that the Court should limit the scope of these agreements and any other confidentiality agreements between\nJDSU and its former employees so that they would not prohibit former JDS Uniphase employees from responding to questions\nposed by investigators for Lead Plaintiff and/or by Lead Counsel related to the alleged securities fraud. No proposed order has\nbeen submitted. Connecticut contends that to the extent JDSU seeks to use the agreements for purposes other than the protection\nof trade secrets, the agreements are unduly broad and should be deemed void as against public policy. Alternatively, Connecticut\nrequests “that the Court: (a) grant plaintiffs permission to depose a limited number of former JDS Uniphase employees prior\nto the Court's decision on the motion to dismiss, or (b) grant plaintiffs an adverse inference that, despite public disclosures to\nthe contrary, defendants were aware of the Company's sharply declining financial condition and results prior to their selling of\nmore than one billion dollars' worth of Company stock.” (Motion at 12.)\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Reform Act's ban on discovery during the pendency of a motion to dismiss does not bar plaintiffs' motion\nJDSU argues that Connecticut's motion is an impermissible attempt to evade the statutory restrictions on early discovery that\nare imposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“Reform Act”). 1 The purpose of the Reform Act was\n“to restrict abuses in securities class-action litigation, including: (1) the practice of filing lawsuits against issuers of securities\nin response to any significant change in stock price, regardless of defendants' culpability; (2) the targeting of “deep pocket”\ndefendants; (3) the abuse of the discovery process to coerce settlement; and (4) manipulation of clients by class action attorneys.”\nSG Cowen Securities Corporation v. United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 189 F.3d 909, 911\n(9th Cir.1999) (quoting In re Advanta Corp. Secs. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 530-31 (3d Cir.1999)). The Reform Act instituted a\nheightened pleading standard, and “mandated a stay of discovery during the pendency of a summary judgment or dismissal\nmotion.” Id.\n\n1       The Court has also received an opposition brief from defendant The Furukawa Electric Co. Ltd. (“Furukawa”), which correctly notes\n        that they are not a party to the confidentiality agreements at issue, and thus Connecticut's references to “defendants” should not be\n        taken to include Furukawa.\nUnder the Reform Act, “all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss,\nunless the court finds upon the motion of any party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent\nundue prejudice to that party.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(B). This section was “intended to prevent unnecessary imposition of\ndiscovery costs on defendants.” SG Cowen, 189 F.3d at 911 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, 104th Cong. 1st Sess. at 32\n(1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. Sess. 731). The Ninth Circuit has held that the Reform Act's discovery stay provision\n“clearly contemplates that ‘discovery should be permitted in securities class actions only after the court has sustained the legal\nsufficiency of the complaint.’ ” Id. at 912 (quoting *1133 S.Rep. No. 104-98, at 14 (1995), reprinted in U.S.C.C.A.N. 693).\nThus, the Ninth Circuit has construed the Reform Act's discovery stay to apply not only during the pendency of a motion to\ndismiss, but until the Court has sustained the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\n\nHere, there is no motion to dismiss pending, but the time for responding to the consolidated complaint has not yet elapsed.\nOn September 12, Judge Wilken signed a stipulation granting defendants until December 9 to respond to the consolidated\ncomplaint. JDSU's counsel indicated at the hearing that they are likely to file a motion to dismiss. As the Court has not yet\nsustained the legal sufficiency of the consolidated complaint, plaintiffs are not yet entitled to take discovery. Accordingly, under\nthe Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the Reform Act in SG Cowen, plaintiffs are not yet entitled to take discovery. Id.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the Reform Act's discovery stay. Discovery is stayed “unless the courts finds upon the motion of\nany party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice.” With respect to the\nfirst exception, there is not a hint of a suggestion in the plaintiff's papers that there is an urgent need to preserve evidence. As\nfor the second exception, the Ninth Circuit has held that a plaintiff's inability, without discovery, to obtain the facts needed\nto meet the Reform Act's heightened pleading requirements is not the sort of “undue prejudice” contemplated by the Reform\nAct. SG Cowen, 189 F.3d at 913.\n\n             The Act requires the trial court to dismiss the complaint if it fails to satisfy the Act's heightened pleading\n             standards. See § 78u-4(b)(3)(A). Thus, as a matter of law, failure to muster facts sufficient to meet the\n             Act's pleading requirements cannot constitute the requisite “undue prejudice” to the plaintiff justifying a\n             lift of the discovery stay under § 78u-4(b)(3)(B). To so hold would contravene the purpose of the Act's\n             heightened pleading standards.\n\nId. Thus, plaintiffs have not shown any justification for lifting the Reform Act's discovery stay to allow them to take depositions\nbefore the Court rules on the upcoming motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Securities Litigation, 238 F.Supp.2d 1127 (2002)\n\n\nBy filing this motion, however, plaintiffs are not seeking discovery in the ordinary sense of the word. In essence, what the\nplaintiffs are asking for is an order from the Court allowing former JDSU employees to speak voluntarily to plaintiffs' lead\ncounsel about certain topics without fear of breaching JDSU's confidentiality agreements. This is not discovery, because\nplaintiffs are not using court process to require these third parties to provide information about the lawsuit. Instead, plaintiffs\nare merely seeking an order that would allow former employees to speak voluntarily if they wish to do so.\n\nJDSU argues, however, that Connecticut's motion falls within the scope of the Reform Act's stay of “all discovery and other\nproceedings.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(B) (emphasis added). In Medhekar v. United States District Court, 99 F.3d 325 (9th\nCir.1996), the Ninth Circuit was asked to determine whether initial disclosures are stayed under the Reform Act during the\npendency of a motion to dismiss. The court held that initial disclosures are discovery, and therefore are included in the Reform\nAct's stay of discovery until the district court upholds the complaint. Id. The court then went on to hold that even if initial\ndisclosures are not the same as discovery, they are at a minimum included in the Reform Act's stay of “discovery and other\nproceedings.” Id. In defining the term “other proceedings,” the Ninth Circuit held that “[g]iven the context and legislative\nhistory of the Act, it *1134 appears that the term was intended to include litigation relating to discovery, which would certainly\ninclude disclosures and would not, as real party fears, include all litigation activity in general.” Id.\n\nHere, however, Connecticut does not seek discovery, but merely seeks a ruling on the scope of JDSU's confidentiality\nagreements with its former employees, so that it may speak with former employees who wish to voluntarily cooperate with\nConnecticut's investigation. Unlike discovery and initial disclosures, these interviews are not compelled by the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure. Neither the former employees nor the defendants are required to participate in these interviews in any way.\nThe Court agrees with In re Tyco International Ltd. Securities Litigation, 2001 U.S. Dist. Lexis 819 (D.N.H.2001), in which the\ndistrict court declined to prohibit voluntary discussions between plaintiffs and third party witnesses because “[n]either logic,\ntradition, the constitution nor the PSLRA prohibit interviewing prospective witnesses.” Id. at *8. In fact, the Reform Act's\nheightened pleading standard encourages plaintiffs to do more investigation before filing a complaint, not less.\n\nIn re Flir Systems Inc. Securities Litigation, 2000 WL 33201904 (D.Or.2000) is also instructive. In Flir, the court was asked to\npermit a deposition of Palmquist, a former employee of the defendant, during the discovery stay. The court distinguished SG\nCowen by noting that discovery was not being sought against the defendant, but against a third party, and thus the discovery\nwould not impose any significant burden on the defendant. Id. at *2. Because Palmquist had filed a civil complaint in state court\nalleging accounting fraud by the defendant, the court found that the proposed discovery was not a mere fishing expedition.\nId. The court also noted that the only reason Palmquist would not talk to the plaintiffs voluntarily was that defendants were\nasserting a confidentiality provision in Palmquist's employment contract. Id. at *3. The court found that the Reform Act “is a\nshield intended to protect security-fraud defendants from costly discovery requirements, [citation omitted], not to be a sword\nwith which defendants can destroy the plaintiffs' ability to obtain information from third parties who are otherwise willing to\ndisclose it.” Id. It is questionable whether Flir 's holding that plaintiffs could depose Palmquist is consistent with SG Cowen.\nThe Court agrees, however, with the Flir court's conclusion that the Reform Act was not intended to provide defendants with\nthe means to bar all investigation into their conduct. The Reform Act was not intended to provide defendants with immunity\nfrom suit, but, rather, was intended to protect defendants from the burdens of defending against frivolous litigation.\n\nPlaintiffs' proposed interviews with former employees of JDSU do not impose any burden or cost on JDSU. The Court finds\nthat plaintiffs' proposed voluntary interviews with former employees do not fall within the scope of “discovery.” Accordingly,\nthe Reform Act's ban on discovery during the pendency of a motion to dismiss has no application to plaintiffs' motion.\n\n\nB. The merits of plaintiffs' motion\nConnecticut states that it has no interest in any information that could be construed as a trade secret, and is willing to discuss\nreasonable measures to accommodate any legitimate concerns of JDSU with respect to use of the information obtained from\nformer employees in the course of its investigation. In Connecticut's reply brief, it provides examples of the types of questions\nthat it wishes to ask former employees, all of which relate directly to the *1135 allegations of wrongdoing that are at issue\nin this case. None of these questions appears to implicate any trade secrets of JDSU, or any other information that JDSU can\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Securities Litigation, 238 F.Supp.2d 1127 (2002)\n\n\nlegitimately claim is confidential. Thus, contrary to JDSU's attempts at misdirection, the issue is not whether JDSU can lawfully\nenter into contracts with its employees to protect its confidential business information and trade secrets. Connecticut concedes\nthat such agreements are lawful. Instead, the issue is whether JDSU's confidentiality agreements can lawfully be used to prohibit\nits former employees from providing whistleblower-type information about allegedly unlawful acts that occurred during their\nemployment with JDSU.\n\nIn Chambers v. Capital Cities/ABC, 159 F.R.D. 441 (S.D.N.Y.1995), an age discrimination case, plaintiffs' counsel wished to\ninterview former employees of the defendant. Plaintiffs sought an order authorizing them to inform those former employees that\nthey could safely disregard agreements with the defendant not to disclose various types of information. The court recognized\nthe legitimacy of agreements between employers and employees that are designed to protect dissemination of confidential\ninformation. Id. at 444. The court also held, however, that:\n\n            It has been recognized that at least in some circumstances, agreements obtained by employers requiring\n            former employees to remain silent about underlying events leading up to disputes, or concerning\n            potentially illegal practices when approached by others can be harmful to the public's ability to rein in\n            improper behavior, and in some contexts ability of the United States to police violations of its laws.\n            Absent possible extraordinary circumstances not present here, it is against public policy for parties to\n            agree not to reveal, at least in the limited contexts of depositions or pre-deposition interviews concerning\n            litigation arising under federal law, facts relating to alleged or potential violations of such law.\n\nId. (footnote omitted). The Court also noted that “agreements restricting former employee revelation of events in the workplace\nwhich are not privileged but may involve violations of federal law have the effect of ‘hindering’ implementation of the\n‘Congressionally mandated duty to enforce the provisions' of federal statutes.” Id. (quoting EEOC v. United States Steel,\n671 F.Supp. 351, 357 (E.D.Pa.1987)). The court declined to authorize plaintiffs' counsel to tell former employees that they\nneed not be concerned about the confidentiality agreements, however, because such a remedy “would make plaintiff's counsel\nthe decisionmaker concerning what confidentiality requirements were related to genuine trade secrets or other legitimately\nprivileged information, and which dealt with concealment of information relating to potential improprieties on the part of the\nemployee.” Id. at 445. Instead, it ordered the defendant to either (1) notify all former employees whom plaintiff wanted to\ninterview, in writing, that no unfavorable consequences for the employees would flow from providing information to plaintiffs'\ncounsel about specific subjects, or (2) accept an adverse inference that the information, if disclosed, would be contrary to\ndefendant's position. Id.\n\n            If applied to depositions or pre-deposition interviewing with respect to litigation under federal substantive\n            law, agreements calling or appearing to call for silence concerning matters relevant to alleged legal\n            violations, whether or not such agreements are sought to be enforced, inherently chill communication\n            relevant to the litigation. Where conduct of a party tends to preclude availability of information relevant\n            to a litigation and where no genuine basis for keeping that information confidential exists, *1136 a\n            court or factfinder may infer that the information, if disclosed, would be contrary to the position of the\n            party engaging in such conduct.\n\nId.\n\nAnother case from the Southern District of New York also held that “[d]isclosures of wrongdoing do not constitute revelations\nof trade secrets which can be prohibited by agreements binding on former employees.” McGrane v. The Reader's Digest\nAssociation, Inc., 822 F.Supp. 1044, 1052 (S.D.N.Y.1993). That court also noted that “[c]ourts are increasingly reluctant\nto enforce secrecy arrangements where matters of substantial concern to the public-as distinct from trade secrets or other\nlegitimately confidential information-may be involved.” Id. at 1046.\n\nCongress has also indicated a public policy in favor of whistleblowers in securities cases. The recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002 prohibits companies from discriminating against employees because of any lawful act by the employee to assist in\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Securities Litigation, 238 F.Supp.2d 1127 (2002)\n\n\nan investigation of securities fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a)(1). At oral argument, defendants correctly pointed out that this section\nonly applied to investigations conducted by the government, or by the company itself. Nonetheless, the statute demonstrates\nthe public policy in favor of allowing even current employees to assist in securities fraud investigations. It certainly does not\nestablish a public policy in favor of allowing employers to muzzle their employees with overbroad confidentiality agreements.\n\nOther than their argument that plaintiffs are attempting to circumvent the discovery stay provision of the Reform Act, JDSU\nprovides very few specific arguments against plaintiff's motion, relying instead primarily on straw-man arguments about the\nvalidity of confidentiality agreements in general. JDSU argues that it used several types of agreements containing provisions\ndesigned to protect its confidential and competitively sensitive business information, and that the form of those agreements\nevolved over the years. (DeWees Decl. ¶¶ 10, 14.) JDSU does not state, however, that these agreements differed in any material\nway from the sample agreements provided by Connecticut. In any event, the issue is not about the specific language of any\nof these agreements, but whether JDSU can ever enforce these types of agreements against former employees to prevent them\nfrom providing non-tradesecret, unprivileged information about JDSU's allegedly illegal activities.\n\nJDSU does point to Patton v. Cox, 276 F.3d 493 (9th Cir.2002), however, which arguably provides some support to JDSU's\nposition. In that case, a doctor, Cox, conducted a court-ordered psychological examination of the plaintiff, Patton, allegedly\npursuant to an oral agreement with Patton to keep the results of the examination confidential. Id. at 494. Patton and his former\nwife were involved in a bitter child custody dispute, and Patton's teenage sister-in-law had alleged that Patton had engaged in\nimproper sexual conduct with her. Id. at 494, 501. Patton was also a doctor, and as a result of his sister-in-law's allegations,\nthe Arizona Board of Medical Examiners (“BOMEX”) filed a complaint against him for unprofessional conduct and unfitness\nto practice medicine. Id. at 494. Dr. Cox voluntarily testified at the BOMEX hearing, and revealed that as a result of his\nexamination of Patton, he believed that Patton was a pedophile and a danger to children. Id. at 495. Patton then sued Dr. Cox\nfor breach of contract. Id.\n\nThe district court granted Dr. Cox's motion to dismiss on the ground that absolute witness immunity precluded any liability\narising from Dr. Cox's testimony at a quasi-judicial hearing. Id. The Ninth Circuit *1137 reversed, applying Arizona law. The\nCourt recognized that Dr. Cox served the public interest by bringing to light the potential danger facing Patton's young, female\npatients. Id. at 498. Nonetheless, the court concluded that:\n\n  applying our perception of Arizona law, we hold that witness immunity does not bar an action for breach of contract when,\n  as in this case, the witness participated voluntarily in a quasi-judicial proceeding. This ruling will not hinder “the resolution\n  of disputes and the ascertainment of truth,” [citation omitted] because witnesses can be compelled to testify as needed, which\n  would then trigger immunity protection.\n\nId. at 500. The Ninth Circuit noted that because Dr. Cox voluntarily entered into the confidentiality agreement, “[h]e chose to\nlimit his ability to share information he obtained about Dr. Patton, and he was not at liberty to breach his obligation even if he\nfelt it was in the public's best interest to do so.” Id.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit did not discuss whether such agreements would be unenforceable in violation of public policy, and thus Patton\ndoes not directly conflict with Chambers. Nonetheless, by holding that the public interest did not trump Cox's confidentiality\nagreement with Patton, a reasonable argument could be made that the Ninth Circuit would not find the confidentiality agreements\nat issue here to be in violation of public policy, at least under Arizona law. This Court, of course, is applying federal law. Patton\nis also distinguishable because, unlike the instant case, Patton involved disclosure of private medical information, which is\nat the core of an individual's right to privacy. See id. (“we cannot help but consider the reasonable expectation of Dr. Patton\nthat this extremely private information would not be disseminated beyond the scope of the Utah court order.”) Highly personal\nmedical information is the sort of information, like trade secrets, that a party unquestionably has the right to ask another party\nto keep confidential.\n\nHere, however, JDSU's confidentiality agreements are so broad that they cover information that cannot possibly be considered\nconfidential. To the extent that those agreements preclude former employees from assisting in investigations of wrongdoing\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Securities Litigation, 238 F.Supp.2d 1127 (2002)\n\n\nthat have nothing to do with trade secrets or other confidential business information, they conflict with the public policy in\nfavor of allowing even current employees to assist in securities fraud investigations.\n\nIn addition, one of the agreements, entitled “Separation Agreement and General Release,” bars former employees who signed it\nfrom making “any disparaging statement” about the company, its clients, vendors or customers. Unlike the agreement at issue in\nPatton, which the court found was voluntarily entered into, plaintiffs stated at the hearing that this agreement was imposed on a\nformer employee in a mass layoff as a condition of receiving severance benefits. Defense counsel acknowledged that plaintiffs'\ncharacterization may be correct. To the extent that this agreement can be read to prohibit an employee from providing any\ninformation about any wrongdoing by JDSU, it is plainly unenforceable.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that Chambers is more applicable here than Patton. The Court agrees with the Chambers court\nthat JDSU cannot use its confidentiality agreements to chill former employees from voluntarily participating in legitimate\ninvestigations into alleged wrongdoing by JDSU. JDSU unquestionably has a legitimate interest in preventing dissemination of\ntrade secrets and confidential business information, however. In order to properly balance these competing interests between\nConnecticut and JDSU, the Court *1138 also agrees with the Chambers court that the appropriate remedy is not to allow\nplaintiffs to be the sole arbiters of whether their investigation avoids infringing on legitimate confidentiality concerns.\n\nThe Court finds that the procedural restrictions imposed in Chambers are unduly cumbersome and elaborate, however. Rather\nthan requiring the defendants to provide written notice to all former employees that plaintiff wished to interview, or accept an\nadverse inference, as in Chambers, the Court will simply rule that answering the questions set forth in plaintiffs' reply brief\nand the additional question requested at the hearing do not violate JDSU's confidentiality agreements. In addition, the Court\nwill require the parties to enter into a protective order providing that any information plaintiffs learn during the course of these\ninterviews may be used only for purposes of this litigation. This will be far less intimidating to the former employee, and far\nless intrusive to the plaintiffs' investigation, than requiring the plaintiffs to provide JDSU with the name of each person they\nwish to interview and requiring JDSU's counsel to attend each interview. By issuing this order restricting the interviews to\nthe questions that plaintiffs have requested, and to narrow followup questions on those topics, the risk that the interviews will\nexpand into areas of legitimate concern to JDSU is minimized.\n\n\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court grants Connecticut's motion to limit the scope of confidentiality agreements signed\nby former JDSU employees, with the following restrictions:\n\n1. All former employees of JDSU may answer the following questions, and any followup questions on the same topic, without\nfear of breaching any confidentiality agreement with JDSU:\n\n  a. At what time during the Class Period did you become aware of a significant downturn in JDSU sales or sale/revenue\n  projections?\n\n  b. Do you have any reason to believe that JDSU managers, officers or directors became aware of that downtown in sales or\n  projections at any time during the Class Period?\n\n  c. At what time during the Class Period did you become aware of a significant decrease in purchasing (including cancellation\n  or modification or contracts) by JDSU?\n\n  d. Do you have any reason to believe that JDSU managers, officers or directors became aware of that downturn in purchasing\n  (or cancellation or modification of contracts) by JDSU?\n\n  e. At what time during the Class Period did you become aware of a downturn in JDSU's production needs, e.g., eliminating\n  work shifts, reducing overtime, instituting a hiring freeze?\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Do you have any reason to believe that JDSU managers, officers or directors became aware of that inventory increase at\n  any time during the Class Period?\n\n  h. At what time during the Class Period did you become aware of any inventory obsolescence problems at JDSU?\n\n  i. Do you have any reason to believe that JDSU managers, officers or directors became aware of that inventory obsolescence\n  problem at any time during the Class Period?\n\n  j. Are you aware of any reason why any JDSU managers, officers or directors sold their JDSU stock during the Class Period?\n\n *1139 2. In answering these questions, former JDSU employees should not disclose any information protected by the attorney-\nclient privilege, nor should they disclose any confidential business methods used by JDSU.\n\n3. Any information plaintiffs learn during the course of their interviews with former JDSU employees may be used only for\npurposes of this litigation.\n\n4. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are entitled to take any depositions prior to the Court's decision on the upcoming\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n5. Plaintiffs have not shown that they are entitled to an inference that, despite public disclosures to the contrary, defendants\nwere aware of JDSU's sharply declining financial condition and results prior to their selling of more than one billion dollars'\nworth of Company stock.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n238 F.Supp.2d 1127\n\nEnd of Document                                                    © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Also before the Court is the Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [102]\nfiled by Defendants, Relator's Response [117], and Defendants' Reply [103]. 1 Having considered the parties' submissions,\nrelevant legal authorities, and the record, the Court is of the opinion that the Motion to Disqualify Relator and Dismiss First\nAmended Complaint [151] should be granted, Relator Donald Holmes should be disqualified from serving as a relator based on\nthe totality of the circumstances surrounding his conduct as a relator, and this civil case should be dismissed without prejudice\nto any rights of the United States government. The Court further finds that the Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [102]\nshould be denied as moot.\n\n1      This case was transferred from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to this Court by Order [73] dated February\n       28, 2013.

BACKGROUND\n\nHurricane Katrina made landfall on the Mississippi Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005. As a result of the damages caused by the\nhurricane, Northrop Grumman Corporation (“NGC”) made claims on an insurance policy issued to a subsidiary of NGC by\nMunich Re, an insurance company represented by attorney Gerald Fisher (“Fisher”).

Fisher Aff. ¶ 7 [11 (Attach.“A”), 26 of 86]; Confidentiality Agreement [11, 56 of 85].\n\nBy April 2010, NGC and Munich Re had commenced arbitration proceedings in London, England, to resolve coverage disputes\nwhich had arisen related to NGC's claim for insurance benefits (“UK Arbitration”). Fisher, along with attorney Donald Holmes\n(“Holmes”), represented Munich Re in the UK Arbitration. Mem. in Supp. of Relators' Mot. to Allow Them to Provide\nInformation to Assist the [DOJ] in Its Investigation 7 [11, 12 of 86] (“Relators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ”). Fisher and Holmes filed\na complaint on behalf of Munich Re on April 6, 2010, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to\nobtain documents from the United States Navy (“the Navy”) purportedly for use in the UK Arbitration. Compl. 1[1], Case No.\n1:10–cv–00551–JEB (D.D.C.) (the “Touhy Action”). On June 2, 2010, while both the UK Arbitration and the Touhy Action\nremained pending, Fisher and Holmes filed the Complaint [1] in this case under seal in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia against NGC, Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Corporation, and Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc.\n(collectively, “Northrop Grumman”), under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733 (“FCA”). 2\nThe United States has declined to intervene in this case. Notice of Election to Decline Intervention 1[20].\n\n2      “The FCA's qui tam provisions permit a private individual, as a relator, to sue on the United States' behalf to recover for false claims\n       for payment submitted to the Government.” United States ex rel. Nunnally v. W. Calcasieu Cameron Hosp., 519 F. App'x 890, 892\n       (5th Cir.2013).\n *2 On August 18, 2012, prior to the transfer of the case, Fisher apparently decided to withdraw from serving as a relator, and\nHolmes filed the operative First Amended Complaint [43] in this case. Holmes alleges that “[t]his case is a civil false claims\naction brought on behalf of the United States by [Holmes], who has properly gained access to documents and information\nshowing that the U.S. Government has been defrauded in the amount of not less than $835 million by the unlawful actions of”\nNorthrop Grumman. First Am. Compl. 5[43]. Holmes asserts that prior to Hurricane Katrina's landfall, Northrop Grumman was\nbehind “in its budget in the performance” of various shipbuilding contracts with the Navy. Id. at 6. Holmes notes that “[w]ithin\nmonths after Hurricane Katrina ..., Congress appropriated $2.3 billion to the Navy in restricted emergency shipbuilding and\nconversion funding [ ] (hereinafter ‘the Katrina Money’)....” Id. at 7. According to Holmes, the Katrina Money “was to be\nused only for ‘the consequences' of” Hurricane Katrina, but Northrop Grumman filed false claims with the Navy by seeking\nreimbursement for unrelated cost overruns which it experienced before and after Hurricane Katrina, thus allowing Northrop\nGrumman to avoid the consequences of its alleged inefficiency and mistakes. Id. at 7–11.\n\nOn the basis of these allegations, Holmes advances claims for violations of the FCA. Am. Compl. 15–24[1]. Holmes maintains\nthat Northrop Grumman violated the FCA by misusing restricted Congressional funding to cover cost overruns on contracts\nfor which Northrop Grumman was financially responsible and by using “[a]rtifices and [d]evices” to deceive the Navy into\npaying for Northrop Grumman's non-Katrina related cost overruns. Id. at 15–20. Holmes further asserts that Northrop Grumman\nviolated the FCA by providing untruthful information to the Navy and Congress to prevent them from making accurate\nprocurement decisions, to conceal the status of contract performance related to seven shipbuilding contracts, and to prevent\ndiscovery of the fact that Northrop Grumman was not keeping separate accounting records which segregated Hurricane Katrina's\nmonetary consequences from unrelated costs. Id. at 20–23.\n\nNorthrop Grumman now moves to disqualify Holmes from serving as a relator and to dismiss the First Amended Complaint\nbased on alleged ethical violations committed by Holmes. Mem. Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Disqualify Relator and Dismiss First\nAm. Compl. 1[153]. According to Northrop Grumman, Holmes has breached his ethical duties of obedience to court orders,\ncandor and honesty to the courts and to Northrop Grumman, respect for Northrop Grumman's legal rights, and loyalty to his\nformer client, Munich Re. Id. at 12–13. Northrop Grumman maintains that Holmes' conduct was not authorized or required by\neither the FCA or misprision of felony statute, 18 U.S.C. § 4. Id. at 19–24.\n\nHolmes offers excerpts from various prior filings which he asserts address Northrop Grumman's Motion [151]. Resp. in Opp'n\nto Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 2–9[156]. Holmes claims that “[f]ederal courts have repeatedly held that confidentiality\nagreements are not a bar to the disclosure of fraud to the government” and posits that such holdings are “directly applicable”\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Holmes asserts that Munich Re had no objection to his decision to report Northrop Grumman's alleged fraud to\nthe United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Id. at 8–9. Holmes also acknowledges that he violated the terms of a Stipulated\nProtective Order issued by the Court in the Touhy Action and notes that “with 20/20 hindsight, he should have handled the\nsituation differently[,]” but Holmes appears to argue the Order is not entitled to be accorded the weight of a court order. Id.\nat 10–11. Holmes also posits that the ethical nature of his conduct should not be considered because the FCA preempts the\nethical rules governing his conduct. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Legal Standard\n *3 In allowing an attorney to serve as a relator and finding the attorney was nevertheless still required to abide by his ethical\nobligations as an attorney, one court has reasoned that “[w]hile the [FCA] permits any person ... to bring a qui tam suit, it\ndoes not authorize that person to violate state laws in the process.” United States ex rel. Doe v. X Corp. (“X Corp. II”), 862\nF.Supp. 1502, 1507 (E.D.Va.1994). Although attorneys may act as relators pro se, non-attorneys are prohibited from proceeding\nas relators pro se. See, e.g., Timson v. Sampson, 518 F.3d 870, 873–74 (11th Cir.2008) (finding that a non-attorney was “not\n[authorized to] maintain a qui tam suit under the FCA as a pro se relator”). A primary policy reason for this prohibition is that\n“[l]awyers are bound to ethical constraints to which non-lawyers may have no knowledge and no obligation[, and v]iolation\nof these fundamental canons may result in serious consequences to the errant attorney.” United States ex rel. Schwartz v. TRW\nInc., 118 F.Supp.2d 991, 995 (C.D.Cal.2000). Furthermore, “[a]n attorney ‘has an obligation which he owes to the court[ ... ],\nand he owes a public duty to aid in the administration of justice, to uphold the dignity of the court and respect its authority.’ “ Id.\n(quoting United States v. Onan, 190 F.2d 1, 6–7 (8th Cir.1951)). These ethical obligations and the consequences of breaching\nthem remain applicable to attorneys proceeding as relators pro se. See X–Corp. II, 862 F.Supp. at 1507 (“[S]tate statutes and\nrules that regulate an attorney's disclosure of client confidences” apply in the context of a qui tam action, and attorneys serving\nas relators therefore have “significant incentives ... to abide by their” state law obligations in light of this fact and “given the\nexistence of state disciplinary powers over attorneys....”). Because Holmes is permitted to act as a relator pro se in this matter\ndue to his status as an attorney, the Court will evaluate whether he should be disqualified from serving as a relator by reference\nto the rules of professional conduct governing Holmes as an attorney.\n\nAn attorney's breach of his ethical obligations may be raised in a motion to disqualify counsel, which is a “substantive\nmotion[ ] ... determined by applying standards developed under federal law .” In re Am. Airlines, 972 F.2d 605, 610 (5th\nCir.1992) (citations omitted) (emphasis removed). Generally, when considering a motion to disqualify counsel in a civil case,\nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals “consider[s] the motion governed by the ethical rules announced by the national profession\nin the light of the public interest and the litigants' rights.” In re Dresser Industries, Inc., 972 F.2d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1992).\nWhile “the relevant local and national ethical canons provide a useful guide for adjudicating motions to disqualify, they are not\ncontrolling.” F.D.I.C. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 50 F.3d 1304, 1314 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). “A court must take into account\nnot only the various ethical precepts adopted by the profession but also the social interests at stake[,]” including whether the\nlawyer's conduct “has (1) the appearance of impropriety in general, or (2) a possibility that a specific impropriety will occur, and\n(3) the likelihood of public suspicion from the impropriety outweighs any social interests which will be served by the lawyer's\ncontinued participation in the case.” Id. (quoting Dresser, 972 F.2d at 544) (internal marks omitted). Disqualification of counsel\n“is a sanction that must not be imposed cavalierly[,]” and the record must reveal “at least a reasonable possibility that some\nidentifiable impropriety actually occurred [ ]” before disqualification will be justified. Id. at 1316.\n\n\nB. Analysis\n\n1. The Court Will Consider the Ethical Nature of Holmes' Conduct\n *4 Insofar as Holmes takes the position that the ethical nature of his conduct is not relevant because the FCA preempts the\nethical rules governing his conduct, this argument is not persuasive. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss\n10–11[156]. Courts addressing the issue of whether the FCA preempts state ethics rules have declined to find preemption. In\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                 3\n\fU.S. ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\nUnited States v. Quest Diagnostics Inc., the Second Circuit Court of Appeals refused to conclude that the FCA preempts the\nState of New York's ethical rules governing attorneys' conduct. 734 F.3d 154, 163 (2d Cir.2013) (“Nothing in the [FCA] evinces\na clear legislative intent to preempt state statutes and rules that regulate an attorney's disclosure of client confidences.”) (citing\nBates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.S. 431, 449 (2005)). Holmes' position is further refuted by the fact that non-lawyers are\nprohibited from proceeding pro se as qui tam relators while lawyers may proceed pro se as qui tam relators due to the ethical\nobligations to which lawyers remain bound and may be subjected to discipline for violating. See Schwartz, 118 F.Supp.2d at\n995 (quoting Onan, 190 F.2d at 6–7). Accordingly, the Court rejects Holmes' invitation to ignore the ethical implications of\nhis conduct.\n\n\n2. Holmes Has Breached Various Standards of Ethics\nIn assessing the entirety of Holmes' conduct related to this case, the Court must identify the applicable “local and national\nethical” standards. See U.S. Fire, 50 F.3d at 1314 (citation omitted). Much of Holmes' conduct occurred while the case was\npending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. This Court therefore will look to “the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct[, ]as adopted by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals” (“DCRPC”). D.D.C. Loc. R. 83.15(a).\nThe Local Uniform Civil Rules for the Northern and Southern Districts of Mississippi provide that the Mississippi Rules of\nProfessional Conduct (“MRPC”) govern litigants practicing in this Court, and thus the Court will also consider the MRPC\ngiven the transfer of the case to this Court. See L.U. Civ. R. 83.1(c). In addition, the Fifth Circuit recognizes the American Bar\nAssociation's Model Rules of Professional Conduct (“ABA Model Rules”) as “the national standards utilized by this circuit\nin ruling on disqualification motions.” Am. Airlines, 972 F.2d at 610. Because of the unique procedural history of this case,\nthe Court will consider the totality of Holmes' conduct related to this case in light of the ethical standards set forth in both the\nDCRPC and MRPC, as well as those of the ABA Model Rules.\n\n\na. Holmes Violated His Duty of Candor\nThe record reveals that Holmes has violated his ethical duty to act with candor. “A lawyer shall not knowingly: (1) make a\nfalse statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the\ntribunal by the lawyer....” ABA Model Rule 3.3(a)(1); see also DCRPC 3.3(a)(1) (same); MRPC 3.3(a)(1) (“A lawyer shall\nnot knowingly ... make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal....”). Additionally, “[i]n the course of representing\na client a lawyer shall not knowingly[ ] ... make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person....” ABA Model\nRule 4.1(a); see also DCRPC 4.1(a) (same); MRPC 4.1(a) (same). “It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in\nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation....” ABA Model Rule 8.4(c); DCRPC 8.4(c) (same); MRPC\n8.4(c) (same).\n\n\n*5 Holmes and Fisher filed the Touhy Action on April 6, 2010, pursuant, in part, to 28 U.S.C. § 1782, 3 and represented\nto the Court that Munich Re sought documents from the Navy “in aid of” the UK Arbitration. 4 Com pl. 1–4[1], Case No.\n1:10–cv–00551–JEB (D.D.C.). Northrop Grumman and Munich Re, through Holmes and Fisher, subsequently submitted a\nStipulated Protective Order, the terms of which were agreed upon by Munich Re, Northrop Grumman, and the Navy, which\nspecifically recited that Munich Re “has a need for the documents being produced by the U.S. Navy for the purposes of the UK\nArbitration[,] ... [and Munich Re] is agreeable to entering into this protective order and protecting the documents [produced by\nthe Navy] appropriately....” Stipulated Protective Order 3 [19–1], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB (D.D.C.). The parties' Stipulated\nProtective Order was entered on June 24, 2010, as an Order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\nOrder 1, Ex. A[20], Case No. 1:10–cv–00551–JEB (D.D.C.).\n\n3      Section 1782 allows parties to apply for and obtain an order that the Navy be required “to produce a document ... for use in a\n       proceeding in a foreign ... tribunal.” 28 U.S.C. § 1782(a).\n4      Munich Re, through Holmes and Fisher, filed an Amended Complaint [21] on May 3, 2010, but the allegations in the Amended\n       Complaint relevant to this Court's analysis do not differ from those of the Complaint. See Am. Compl. 7, 11[21], Case No. 1:10–cv–\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                   4\n\fU.S. ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\n       551–JEB (D.D.C.). In fact, Holmes and Fisher, on behalf of Munich Re, further alleged that Munich Re's “exercise of rights provided\n       by 28 U.S.C. § 1782 are in aid of private foreign arbitration only....” Am. Compl. 11[21].\nHolmes points out that this qui tam case was not filed until June 2, 2010, nearly two months after he and Fisher filed the Touhy\nAction, and Holmes appears to suggest that there cannot be a connection between documents sought from the Navy in the\npreviously filed Touhy Action and this qui tam case. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 7[156]. Holmes,\nhowever, acknowledges in the First Amended Complaint [43] he filed in this case that he had “gained access to documents\nand information showing that the U.S. Government has been defrauded” and explicitly based his claim on “documentation\nsubmitted by Northrop Grumman to the Navy....” Am. Compl. 5, 6, 10, 11[43]. 5 These allegations reveal Holmes' clear intent\nto support his qui tam claims in this case with the documents he obtained from the Navy through the Touhy Action purportedly\nfor use in the UK Arbitration. This calls into question the veracity of Holmes' statements made not only to the court in the Touhy\nAction as to why he sought the documents but also to this Court insofar as Holmes alleges he has “properly gained access to”\nthe documents upon which the First Amended Complaint is based. See, e .g., Am. Compl. 11[21], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB\n(D.D.C.) (alleging, through Holmes and Fisher, that Munich Re's “exercise of rights provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1782 are in aid of\nprivate foreign arbitration only”); Ex. “A” to Jt. Mot. to Enter Protective Order 3 [19–1], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB (D.D.C.)\n(submitting proposed stipulated protective order in which Munich Re, through Holmes and Fisher, recites that it “is agreeable\nto entering into this protective order and protecting the documents [produced by the Navy] appropriately”); First Am. Compl.\n5[43]. There is no evidence in the record that Holmes ever attempted to correct these statements. As a result, the Court finds\nthat Holmes violated his duty of candor by obtaining documents from the Navy through the Touhy Action without disclosing\nhis intent to use the documents to support his claims in this qui tam case.\n\n5      Holmes and Fisher even predicted in the original Complaint [1] that “[u]pon review of documents submitted by Northrop Grumman\n       to the [Navy], ... those records will show that Northrop Grumman also improperly used Katrina Money for pre-Katrina overruns....”\n       Compl. 8[1]. Though slightly rephrased, this allegation also appears in the First Amended Complaint [43] filed by Holmes. See First\n       Am. Compl. 11[43] (“[Holmes] alleges that the records submitted by Northrop Grumman to the Naval Sea Systems Command in\n       support of its claims for payment show that Northrop Grumman also improperly used Katrina Money for pre-Katrina overruns to\n       its subcontracts and material costs.”).\n\n\nb. Holmes and His Duty of Loyalty to Munich Re\n *6 Unless the client gives informed consent, “a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent\nconflict of interest.” ABA Model Rule 1.7(a). “A concurrent conflict of interest exists if[ ] ... there is a significant risk that\nthe representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to ... a third person or by a\npersonal interest of the lawyer.” Id. at 1.7(a)(2); see also DCRPC 1.7(b)(4) (“[A] lawyer shall not represent a client with respect\nto a matter if [ ] ... [t]he lawyer's professional judgment on behalf of the client will be or reasonably may be adversely affected\nby the lawyer's responsibilities to or interests in a third party or the lawyer's own financial, business, property, or personal\ninterests.”); MRPC 1 .7(b) (“A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited\nby the lawyer's responsibilities ... to a third person[ ] or by the lawyer's own interests unless ... the client has given knowing\nand informed consent after consultation.”).\n\nIn the UK Arbitration, Holmes and Fisher, on Munich Re's behalf, took the position that Munich Re did not owe compensation\nto NGC for certain losses related to Hurricane Katrina because the Navy had previously paid Defendants to compensate for\nthose losses. See United States' Consolidated Resp. to Relators' Ex Parte Motions 6–7[14]. However, at the same time he was\nrepresenting Munich Re in the UK Arbitration Holmes filed the Complaint [1] and First Amended Complaint [43], in which he\nalleged that the Navy should have never paid funds to Defendants and that it was Defendants' fraudulent conduct which duped\nthe Navy into paying the funds. Id. Holmes has not sufficiently disputed this characterization of the conflicting positions he\ntook as counsel for Munich Re, on the one hand, and as a relator in this case seeking over 2.5 billion dollars, 6 on the other.\nThese positions reflect a conflict between Holmes' personal interest as a relator, arguing that the Navy's payments to Northrop\nGrumman were invalid, and Holmes' interest as counsel to Munich Re, advocating the validity of those same payments to\nalleviate Munich Re's responsibilities to Northrop Grumman. Consequently, the record supports a finding that there was at\nleast “a significant risk” that Holmes' representation of Munich Re was “materially limited by” Holmes' “personal interest”\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                     5\n\fU.S. ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\nin pursing this qui tam case, such that Holmes' conduct created a concurrent conflict of interest jeopardizing his obligation of\nloyalty to Munich Re. See ABA Model Rule 1.7(a).\n\n6      Holmes alleges that the United States was defrauded in the amount of “not less than $835 million” and “prays ... for treble that sum\n       or $2.505 billion” dollars. First Am. Compl. 23[43].\nFaced with this conflict, there is no evidence that Holmes obtained any kind of “informed consent” from Munich Re to\nsimultaneously represent Munich Re while prosecuting this qui tam action. See ABA Model Rule 1.7 (prohibiting concurrent\nconflicts of interest but making an exception where the attorney obtains affected clients' informed consent). “ ‘Informed consent’\ndenotes the agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and\nexplanation about the material risks of and reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of conduct.” ABA Model\nRules 1 .0(e); see also DCRPC 1.0(e) (same); MRPC, Terminology (“ ‘Informed consent’ denotes voluntary acceptance and\nagreement by a person of a proposed course of conduct after adequate information has been imparted to the person that allows\nthe person to arrive at a decision.”). The Comment to ABA Model Rule 1.0(e) notes that informed consent is often required\n“before ... pursuing a course of conduct.” Comment [6], ABA Model Rule 1.0 (citing ABA Model Rules 1.2(c), 1.6(a) and\n1.7(b)). The Comment also states\n\n             *7 [t]he lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the client or other person possesses\n            information reasonably adequate to make an informed decision. Ordinarily, this will require\n            communication that includes a disclosure of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the situation, any\n            explanation reasonably necessary to inform the client or other person of the material advantages and\n            disadvantages of the proposed course of conduct and a discussion of the client's or other person's options\n            and alternatives.\n\nComment [6], ABA Model Rule 1.0.\n\nThe record does not reveal facts supporting a finding that Holmes obtained Munich Re's informed consent at any point in time\nto engage in a course of conduct which created a concurrent conflict of interest between Holmes' duties to Munich Re and his\nown personal interests in this case. Holmes suggests that he obtained consent from Munich Re, but the timing of Munich Re's\n“consent” is questionable and there is no evidence the consent was “informed.” Specifically, Holmes contends\n\n            [the DOJ] directly asked the client, Munich Re, orally and in writing, specifically whether it had any\n            concerns about its counsel disclosing the information of the fraud to the DOJ. Munich Re specifically\n            responded in writing that it had no objection and did not participate in that decision, but respected\n            counsel's view of their obligations to disclose to [the] DOJ under U.S. law.\n\nResp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 9[156]. Holmes does not identify when he discussed his perceived\nlegal obligations with Munich Re, the content of those discussions, or whether Munich Re had the benefit of independent\ncounsel.

Holmes thus has not\ndemonstrated facts supporting a finding that Holmes had Munich Re's informed consent to engage in conduct that involved a\nconcurrent conflict of interest, and as such, Holmes breached his duty of loyalty to his client, Munich Re, in order to bolster\nhis position in this case.\n\n\nc.

Relators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ [11, 4 of 86] (“Relators have provided the Government with an extensive Disclosure\nMemorandum pointing out that the evidence of this fraud is based on documents available directly from the Navy, many of\nwhich Relators obtained pursuant to Touhy Regulation Requests in connection with ongoing litigation on an insurance claim.”).\nThese documents were subject to various confidentiality obligations existing between Munich Re, Northrop Grumman, and the\nNavy, and a Stipulated Protective Order imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See Ex. “1” to\nRelators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ [11, 56–66 of 86]; Stipulated Protective Order [20–1], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB (D .D.C.).\nThere is no indication that Holmes would have otherwise come into possession of these documents but for his representation\nof Munich Re. Holmes acknowledged using these documents to pursue this qui tam action in which he seeks over 2.5 billion\ndollars, a portion of which would be available to him by virtue of his serving as relator. See, e.g., First Am. Compl. 9, 10, 23[43].\nAbsent Munich Re's informed consent, Holmes violated the duty to keep information related to his representation of Munich\nRe confidential when he revealed and made use of the documents he obtained during his representation of Munich Re. 8\n\n8       In addition, it is likely that Holmes' conduct violated Rule 4.4(a) of the ABA Model Rules. “In representing a client, a lawyer shall\n        not use ... methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of ... a [third] person.” ABA Model Rule 4.4(a); see also DCRPC\n        4.4(a) (same); MRPC 4.4(a) (same). In obtaining documents from Northrop Grumman and the Navy, Holmes, on behalf of Munich\n        Re, submitted to at least one agreement to keep documents Munich Re received from Northrop Grumman confidential and participated\n        in the creation and submission of the Stipulated Protective Order restricting the use and dissemination of documents received by\n        Munich Re from the Navy. Holmes' use of these documents for his own purposes in this qui tam action can reasonably be construed\n        as violating the legal rights of Northrop Grumman and the Navy.\nHolmes has not shown that he obtained Munich Re's informed consent prior to revealing and making use of confidential\ninformation he obtained as counsel for Munich Re. See ABA Model Rule 1.6 (prohibiting attorneys from revealing clients'\nconfidential information absent the client's informed consent). Holmes appears to acknowledge that Munich Re “did not\nparticipate in” his decision to disclose to the DOJ documents that he obtained on Munich Re's behalf and which fell within the\nscope of the various confidentiality obligations he owed Munich Re. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss\n9[156]; see also ABA Model Rule 1.6(a) (“A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless\nthe client gives informed consent [ ]....”); MRPC 1.6(a) (same); DCRPC 1.6(a) (“[A] lawyer shall not knowingly: ... reveal a\nconfidence or secret of the lawyer's client[,] ... use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client to the disadvantage of the client\n[, or] ... use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client for the advantage of the lawyer or of a third person....”). Similar to\nhis actions surrounding the concurrent conflict of interest which jeopardized his duty of loyalty to Munich Re, Holmes has not\nsufficiently established that he obtained Munich Re's informed consent prior to revealing Munich Re's confidential information.\nConsequently, Holmes breached his duty to protect his client's confidential information.\n\n\nd. Holmes' Duty to Obey Court Orders\n *9 Perhaps the most serious of the ethical violations committed by Holmes is his having knowingly ignored his obligations\nunder the Stipulated Protective Order entered in the Touhy Action by the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia. “A lawyer shall not[ ] ... knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal\nbased on an assertion that no valid obligation exists....” ABA Model Rule 3 .4(c); see also DCRPC 3.4(c) (same); MRPC 3.4(c)\n(same). Holmes notes that the Stipulated Protective Order was first submitted as a proposed order and seems to argue that it\nshould not be treated as a court order. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 10–11[156]. This argument\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                        7\n\fU.S. ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\noverlooks the fact that Holmes jointly submitted the Stipulated Protective Order as a proposed order, and the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia specifically entered the Stipulated Protective Order “as an [O]rder of the Court....”\nOrder 1 [20–1], Case No. 1:10cv551–JEB (D.D.C .). Holmes was undoubtedly required to comply with the obligations imposed\nby the Stipulated Protective Order.\n\nThe Stipulated Protective Order provides that documents produced by the Navy “shall be used or disclosed solely in the UK\nArbitration” and “shall not be used in any other proceeding or for any other purpose without further order of this Court.” Id.\nat 6–7 [20–1, 9–10 of 13]. Holmes openly acknowledges that he violated the terms of the Stipulated Protective Order by his\nadmission that he disclosed documents subject to the Stipulated Protective Order to the DOJ and allowed his “expert team”\nto analyze such documents. 9 Relators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ 2, 10–12 [11, 4, 12–14 of 86]. If he had an objection to the\nNavy's designation of any information as being protected under the Stipulated Protective Order, the Stipulated Protective Order\nrequired Holmes to make an objection to the particular designations, but the record does not reveal that Holmes made any such\nobjections. Stipulated Protective Order 8 [20–1, 11 of 13], Case No. 1:10cv551–JEB (D.D.C.); see also Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.'\nMot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 6[156] (“With perfect 20/20 hindsight [,]” Holmes agrees that he “should have separately sought\n[the Court's] permission to use the documents” obtained in the Touhy Action and that doing so “would have been a good thing\nto do....”). Holmes was well aware of the terms of the Stipulated Protective Order, and requested that the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia enter the Stipulated Protective Order, but knowingly violated the obligations imposed by that Order in\npursuit of his own interests in this qui tam action. Holmes' violation of the Stipulated Protective Order is yet another example\nof his unethical conduct surrounding his actions as a relator in this case.\n\n9      Prior cases indicate that one court generally should decline from evaluating whether a litigant before it has violated the order of\n       another court. See, e.g., In re Wright, No. Civ. A. 06–356, 2006 WL 508050, at *3 (E.D.La. Feb. 22, 2006) (“[I]t would be an\n       unwise policy for one court to determine whether a litigant violated another court's order.”) (citing In re Marriage of Smith, 549\n       F.Supp. 761, 755 (W.D.Tex.1982)). The Court, however, finds that this general principle is not implicated under the specific facts\n       of this case because Holmes has acknowledged repeatedly that he violated the Stipulated Protective Order and thus the Court need\n       not determine whether a violation has occurred. Moreover, the Court expressly limits its consideration of Holmes' violation of the\n       Stipulated Protective Order to being only one of several factors militating in favor of disqualifying Holmes from serving as a relator\n       in this case. Still, the seriousness of Holmes' violation of the Stipulated Protective Order should not be overlooked. See Holden v.\n       Simpson Paper Co., 48 F. App'x 917, 2002 WL 31115137, at *2 (5th Cir. Sept. 18, 2002) (“Deliberately disobeying court orders\n       demonstrates sufficient bad faith to justify a district court's sanction under its inherent powers.”).\n\n\n3. The Totality of Holmes' Ethical Violations Require His Disqualification as Relator\n *10 When viewed in its entirety, Holmes' conduct reveals multiple improprieties. See U.S. Fire, 50 F.3d at 1314 (noting that\ncourts adjudicating a motion to disqualify should consider, in addition to relevant ethical precepts, the impropriety of counsel's\nconduct and the extent to which public suspicion of that conduct outweighs any social interests served by allowing counsel\nto continue participating) (quoting Dresser, 972 F.2d at 544) (internal marks omitted). Holmes' conduct did not merely bear\nthe appearance of impropriety but was in fact improper. Holmes violated his duty of loyalty to Munich Re by simultaneously\nadvocating a position for Munich Re that was completely contrary to the position he continues to advocate as relator in this\ncase. Holmes violated his duty to retain confidential information by allowing his own interest in pursing this qui tam action to\noverride his duties to Munich Re related to the confidentiality of documents he obtained on Munich Re's behalf, which placed\nMunich Re in jeopardy of violating various confidentiality obligations to which Holmes knew his client was bound. In seeking\nto build support for his qui tam case, Holmes also knowingly violated the Stipulated Protective Order issued by the court in the\nTouhy Action. All the while, Holmes violated his duty of candor by failing to apprise the court in the Touhy Action or counsel\nfor NGC in the UK Arbitration of his motives for obtaining the confidential information.\n\nThe accompanying public suspicion arising from Holmes' conduct outweighs any social interest in permitting him to continue\nparticipating as a relator. See U.S. Fire, 50 F.3d at 1314 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting Dresser, 972 F.2d at 544). The potential for\npublic suspicion stemming from this conduct is exemplified by the DOJ's concerns that Holmes' conduct gave rise to “serious\nethical and professional responsibility concerns....” United States' Consolidated Resp. to Relators' Ex Parte Motions 6[14].\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\nFurthermore, in considering Holmes' disqualification, the Court is not faced with the prospect of disqualifying an innocent\nparty's chosen counsel. Rather, disqualifying Holmes only precludes him from receiving the benefits which may otherwise be\navailable to him personally as a relator, such that the social interests in allowing him to continue participating in this case are\nminimal. The Court finds that based on the totality of the ethical violations committed by Holmes surrounding this qui tam\ncase, Holmes should be disqualified from serving as relator in this case.\n\n\n4. Dismissal of the First Amended Complaint\nIn determining whether dismissal of the First Amended Complaint [43] is warranted, the pertinent inquiry is the extent to which\nNorthrop Grumman stands to suffer prejudice if the action were to proceed to trial. See Quest Diagnostics, 734 F.3d at 166–67\n(affirming district court's decision to disqualify relators and dismiss their qui tam complaint due to the fact that allowing the\ncase to proceed “would taint the trial proceedings and prejudice defendants”). Here, the Court finds that merely disqualifying\nHolmes from serving as relator without dismissing the case would greatly prejudice Northrop Grumman because the case would\nbe tried on a record developed primarily through the fruits of Holmes' unethical conduct. In addition, the fact that the United\nStates government rather than Holmes is the real party in interest further supports dismissing Holmes' First Amended Complaint\n[43]. See United States ex rel. Williams v. Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., 417 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir.2005). Namely, as the real\nparty in interest, the government would not be prevented from bringing these or similar claims against Northrop Grumman. See\nQuest Diagnostics, 734 F.3d at 167 (noting that dismissal of the disqualified relators' complaint was further justified by the fact\nthat neither the United States, as the real party in interest, nor any other relator was foreclosed from bringing the claims). The\nCourt thus finds that the First Amended Complaint [43] should be dismissed with prejudice as to Holmes but without prejudice\nas to any rights of the United States. 10\n\n10     The Fifth Circuit has found that dismissal of a relator's complaint should not necessarily operate as a dismissal with prejudice\n       against the United States merely because it opted not to intervene. Williams, 417 F.3d at 454–55 (finding that dismissal of a relator's\n       complaint for failure to comply with Rule 9(b) did not operate as a dismissal with prejudice against the government simply because\n       the government did not intervene). This is because the FCA “does not require the government to proceed if its investigation [of\n       allegations in a qui tam complaint] yields a meritorious claim.” Id. at 455.\n\n\n\n                                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n *11 Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Donald Holmes should be disqualified from serving as a relator in this\nqui tam case, and that this civil action should be dismissed with prejudice as to Holmes, but without prejudice to any rights\npossessed by the United States government.\n\nIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion to Disqualify Relator and Dismiss the First Amended\nComplaint [151] filed by Defendants Northrop Grumman Corporation and Huntington Ingalls Incorporated is GRANTED.\n\nIT IS, FURTHER, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Donald Holmes is DISQUALIFIED from serving as a relator in\nthis qui tam case.\n\nIT IS, FURTHER, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that this case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as to Donald Holmes,\nbut WITHOUT PREJUDICE as to any rights of the United States government.\n\nIT IS, FURTHER, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [102] filed by Defendants\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation and Huntington Ingalls Incorporated is DENIED AS MOOT.\n\nSO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Washington\nSuperior Court, Geoffrey W. Crawford, J., entered judgment on jury's verdict in patient's favor, and manufacturer appealed.\nThe Vermont Supreme Court, Johnson, J., 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179, affirmed. Certiorari was granted.\n\n\n\n[Holding:] The United States Supreme Court, Justice Stevens, held that state law failure-to-warn claims against manufacturer\nof antihistamine that was used to treat nausea, for failing to adequately warn of dangers of administering drug intravenously\nusing an IV-push, rather than IV-drip, methodology, were not preempted by federal law, either on theory that manufacturer\ncould not have modified warning label placed on drug once it had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\nand that it was impossible for manufacturer to comply with both state law duties underlying failure-to-warn claims and its\nfederal labeling duties, or on theory that requiring manufacturer to comply with state law duty to provide stronger warning\nabout IV-push administration, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had previously approved warning label placed\non drug, would obstruct purposes and objectives of federal drug labeling regulation.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\nJustice Breyer concurred and filed opinion.\n\nJustice Thomas concurred in judgment and filed opinion.\n\nJustice Alito dissented and filed opinion, in which Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Scalia joined.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          **1189 *555 Syllabus *\n\n*       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience\n        of the reader.

After a clinician injected respondent Levine with Phenergan by\nthe “IV-push” method, whereby a drug is injected directly into a patient's vein, the drug entered Levine's artery, she developed\ngangrene, and doctors amputated her forearm. Levine brought a state-law damages action, alleging, inter alia, that Wyeth had\nfailed to provide an adequate warning about the significant risks of administering Phenergan by the IV-push method. The\nVermont jury determined that Levine's injury would not have occurred if Phenergan's label included an adequate warning, and it\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(CCH) P 18,176...\n\nawarded damages for her pain and suffering, substantial medical expenses, and loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.\nDeclining to overturn the verdict, the trial court rejected Wyeth's argument that Levine's failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted\nby federal law because Phenergan's labeling had been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The\nVermont Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nHeld: Federal law does not pre-empt Levine's claim that Phenergan's label did not contain an adequate warning about the IV-\npush method of administration. Pp. 1193 – 1204.\n\n(a) The argument that Levine's state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for Wyeth to comply with both the state-\nlaw duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties is rejected. Although a manufacturer generally may change\na drug label only after the FDA approves a supplemental application, the agency's “changes being effected” (CBE) regulation\npermits certain preapproval labeling changes that add or strengthen a warning to improve drug safety. Pursuant to the CBE\nregulation, Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration, and there is no evidence that\nthe FDA would ultimately have rejected such a labeling change. Wyeth's cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad\nassertion that unilaterally changing the Phenergan label would have violated federal law governing unauthorized distribution\nand misbranding of drugs are based on the fundamental misunderstanding that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears\nprimary responsibility for drug labeling. It is a central premise of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the\nFDA's regulations that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times. Pp. 1196 – 1199.\n\n **1190 *556 (b) Wyeth's argument that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning would\ninterfere with Congress' purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions is meritless because it relies on an\nuntenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency's power to pre-empt state law. The history\nof the FDCA shows that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions. In advancing the argument\nthat the FDA must be presumed to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law\njudgments, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress but on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-\nlaw failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDA's statutorily prescribed role. Although an agency regulation with the force of law\ncan pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agency's assertion that state law\nis an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives. Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt\nstate law directly, the weight this Court accords the agency's explanation of state law's impact on the federal scheme depends on\nits thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness. Cf., e.g.,Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124.\nUnder this standard, the FDA's 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDA's failure to\noffer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence\nof Congress' purposes; and it reverses the FDA's own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug\nregulation without providing a reasoned explanation.

A\nVermont **1191 jury found that petitioner Wyeth, the manufacturer of the drug, had failed to provide an adequate warning of\nthat risk and awarded damages to respondent Diana Levine to compensate her for the amputation of her arm. The warnings on\nPhenergan's label had been deemed sufficient by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when it approved Wyeth's\nnew drug application in 1955 and when it later approved changes in the drug's labeling. The question we must decide is whether\nthe FDA's approvals provide *559 Wyeth with a complete defense to Levine's tort claims. We conclude that they do not.\n\n\n\n                                                                     I\n\nPhenergan is Wyeth's brand name for promethazine hydrochloride, an antihistamine used to treat nausea. The injectable form\nof Phenergan can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and it can be administered intravenously through either\nthe “IV-push” method, whereby the drug is injected directly into a patient's vein, or the “IV-drip” method, whereby the drug\nis introduced into a saline solution in a hanging intravenous bag and slowly descends through a catheter inserted in a patient's\nvein. The drug is corrosive and causes irreversible gangrene if it enters a patient's artery.\n\nLevine's injury resulted from an IV-push injection of Phenergan. On April 7, 2000, as on previous visits to her local clinic\nfor treatment of a migraine headache, she received an intramuscular injection of Demerol for her headache and Phenergan for\nher nausea. Because the combination did not provide relief, she returned later that day and received a second injection of both\ndrugs. This time, the physician assistant administered the drugs by the IV-push method, and Phenergan entered Levine's artery,\neither because the needle penetrated an artery directly or because the drug escaped from the vein into surrounding tissue (a\nphenomenon called “perivascular extravasation”) where it came in contact with arterial blood. As a result, Levine developed\ngangrene, and doctors amputated first her right hand and then her entire forearm. In addition to her pain and suffering, Levine\nincurred substantial medical expenses and the loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.\n\nAfter settling claims against the health center and clinician, Levine brought an action for damages against Wyeth, relying on\ncommon-law negligence and strict-liability theories. Although Phenergan's labeling warned of the danger of gangrene and\namputation following inadvertent intra-arterial *560 injection, 1 Levine alleged that **1192 the labeling was defective\nbecause it failed to instruct clinicians to use the IV-drip method of intravenous administration instead of the higher risk IV-push\nmethod. More broadly, she alleged that Phenergan is not reasonably safe for intravenous administration because the foreseeable\nrisks of gangrene and loss of limb are great in relation to the drug's therapeutic benefits. App. 14–15.\n\n1      The warning for “Inadvertent Intra-arterial Injection” stated: “Due to the close proximity of arteries and veins in the areas most\n       commonly used for intravenous injection, extreme care should be exercised to avoid perivascular extravasation or inadvertent intra-\n       arterial injection. Reports compatible with inadvertent intra-arterial injection of Phenergan Injection, usually in conjunction with\n       other drugs intended for intravenous use, suggest that pain, severe chemical irritation, severe spasm of distal vessels, and resultant\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Intravenous injection was intended in all the cases reported but\n        perivascular extravasation or arterial placement of the needle is now suspect. There is no proven successful management of this\n        condition after it occurs.... Aspiration of dark blood does not preclude intra-arterial needle placement, because blood is discolored\n        upon contact with Phenergan Injection. Use of syringes with rigid plungers or of small bore needles might obscure typical arterial\n        backflow if this is relied upon alone. When used intravenously, Phenergan Injection should be given in a concentration no greater\n        than 25 mg per mL and at a rate not to exceed 25 mg per minute. When administering any irritant drug intravenously, it is usually\n        preferable to inject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily. In the event that a\n        patient complains of pain during intended intravenous injection of Phenergan Injection, the injection should be stopped immediately\n        to provide for evaluation of possible arterial placement or perivascular extravasation.” App. 390.\nWyeth filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Levine's failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by federal law. The\ncourt found no merit in either Wyeth's field pre-emption argument, which it has since abandoned, or its conflict pre-emption\nargument. With respect to the contention that there was an “actual conflict between a specific FDA order,”id., at 21, and Levine's\nfailure-to-warn action, the *561 court reviewed the sparse correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA about Phenergan's\nlabeling and found no evidence that Wyeth had “earnestly attempted” to strengthen the intra-arterial injection warning or that\nthe FDA had “specifically disallowed” stronger language, id., at 23. The record, as then developed, “lack[ed] any evidence that\nthe FDA set a ceiling on this matter.” Ibid.\n\nThe evidence presented during the 5–day jury trial showed that the risk of intra-arterial injection or perivascular extravasation\ncan be almost entirely eliminated through the use of IV-drip, rather than IV-push, administration. An IV drip is started with\nsaline, which will not flow properly if the catheter is not in the vein and fluid is entering an artery or surrounding tissue. See\nid., at 50–51, 60, 66–68, 75. By contrast, even a careful and experienced clinician using the IV-push method will occasionally\nexpose an artery to Phenergan. See id., at 73, 75–76. While Phenergan's labeling warned against intra-arterial injection and\nperivascular extravasation and advised that “[w]hen administering any irritant drug intravenously it is usually preferable to\ninject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily,” id., at 390, the labeling\ndid not contain a specific warning about the risks of IV-push administration.\n\nThe trial record also contains correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA discussing Phenergan's label. The FDA first\napproved injectable Phenergan in 1955. In 1973 and 1976, Wyeth submitted supplemental new drug applications, which the\nagency approved after proposing labeling changes. Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application in 1981 in response to a\nnew FDA rule governing drug labels. Over the next 17 years, Wyeth and the FDA intermittently corresponded about Phenergan's\nlabel. The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure,\nand in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the *562 proposed changes. The FDA did not respond.\nInstead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth's 1988 submission, instructed\nit to “[r]etain verbiage in current label” regarding intra-arterial injection. Id., at 359. After a few further changes to the labeling\nnot related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA approved Wyeth's 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan's final\nprinted label “must be identical” to the approved package insert. Id., at 382.\n\nBased on this regulatory history, the trial judge instructed the jury that it could **1193 consider evidence of Wyeth's\ncompliance with FDA requirements but that such compliance did not establish that the warnings were adequate. He also\ninstructed, without objection from Wyeth, that FDA regulations “permit a drug manufacturer to change a product label to add\nor strengthen a warning about its product without prior FDA approval so long as it later submits the revised warning for review\nand approval.” Id., at 228.\n\nAnswering questions on a special verdict form, the jury found that Wyeth was negligent, that Phenergan was a defective product\nas a result of inadequate warnings and instructions, and that no intervening cause had broken the causal connection between\nthe product defects and the plaintiff's injury. Id., at 233–235. It awarded total damages of $7,400,000, which the court reduced\nto account for Levine's earlier settlement with the health center and clinician.Id., at 235–236.\n\nOn August 3, 2004, the trial court filed a comprehensive opinion denying Wyeth's motion for judgment as a matter of law. After\nmaking findings of fact based on the trial record (supplemented by one letter that Wyeth found after the trial), the court rejected\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It determined that there was no direct conflict between FDA regulations and Levine's state-\nlaw claims because those regulations permit strengthened warnings without FDA approval on an interim basis and the record\ncontained evidence *563 of at least 20 reports of amputations similar to Levine's since the 1960's. The court also found that\nstate tort liability in this case would not obstruct the FDA's work because the agency had paid no more than passing attention\nto the question whether to warn against IV-push administration of Phenergan. In addition, the court noted that state law serves\na compensatory function distinct from federal regulation. Id., at 249–252.\n\nThe Vermont Supreme Court affirmed. It held that the jury's verdict “did not conflict with FDA's labeling requirements for\nPhenergan because [Wyeth] could have warned against IV-push administration without prior FDA approval, and because\nfederal labeling requirements create a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation.” 183 Vt. 76, 84, 944 A.2d 179, 184 (2006). In\ndissent, Chief Justice Reiber argued that the jury's verdict conflicted with federal law because it was inconsistent with the FDA's\nconclusion that intravenous administration of Phenergan was safe and effective.\n\nThe importance of the pre-emption issue, coupled with the fact that the FDA has changed its position on state tort law and\nnow endorses the views expressed in Chief Justice Reiber's dissent, persuaded us to grant Wyeth's petition for certiorari. 552\nU.S. 1161, 128 S.Ct. 1118, 169 L.Ed.2d 845 (2008). The question presented by the petition is whether the FDA's drug labeling\njudgments “preempt state law product liability claims premised on the theory that different labeling judgments were necessary\nto make drugs reasonably safe for use.” Pet. for Cert. i.\n\n\n\n                                                                     II\n\nWyeth makes two separate pre-emption arguments: first, that it would have been impossible for it to comply with the state-\nlaw duty to modify Phenergan's labeling without violating federal law, see Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. de la Cuesta,\n458 U.S. 141, 153, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982), and second, that recognition of Levine's state tort action creates\nan unacceptable “obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes *564 and objectives of Congress,”\n **1194 Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941), because it substitutes a lay jury's decision\nabout drug labeling for the expert judgment of the FDA. As a preface to our evaluation of these arguments, we identify two\nfactual propositions decided during the trial court proceedings, emphasize two legal principles that guide our analysis, and\nreview the history of the controlling federal statute.\n\nThe trial court proceedings established that Levine's injury would not have occurred if Phenergan's label had included an\nadequate warning about the risks of the IV-push method of administering the drug. The record contains evidence that the\nphysician assistant administered a greater dose than the label prescribed, that she may have inadvertently injected the drug\ninto an artery rather than a vein, and that she continued to inject the drug after Levine complained of pain. Nevertheless, the\njury rejected Wyeth's argument that the clinician's conduct was an intervening cause that absolved it of liability. See App. 234\n(jury verdict), 252–254. In finding Wyeth negligent as well as strictly liable, the jury also determined that Levine's injury was\nforeseeable. That the inadequate label was both a but-for and proximate cause of Levine's injury is supported by the record\nand no longer challenged by Wyeth. 2\n\n2      The dissent nonetheless suggests that physician malpractice was the exclusive cause of Levine's injury. See, e.g., post, at 1217\n       (opinion of ALITO, J.) (“[I]t is unclear how a ‘stronger’ warning could have helped respondent”); post, at 1225 – 1227 (suggesting\n       that the physician assistant's conduct was the sole cause of the injury). The dissent's frustration with the jury's verdict does not put\n       the merits of Levine's tort claim before us, nor does it change the question we must decide—whether federal law pre-empts Levine's\n       state-law claims.\nThe trial court proceedings further established that the critical defect in Phenergan's label was the lack of an adequate\nwarning about the risks of IV-push administration. Levine also offered evidence that the IV-push method should *565 be\ncontraindicated and that Phenergan should never be administered intravenously, even by the IV-drip method. Perhaps for this\nreason, the dissent incorrectly assumes that the state-law duty at issue is the duty to contraindicate the IV-push method. See, e.g.,\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Levine, 555 U.S. 555 (2009)\n129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51, 77 USLW 4165, Prod.Liab.Rep. (CCH) P 18,176...\n\npost, at 1221, 1230 – 1231. But, as the Vermont Supreme Court explained, the jury verdict established only that Phenergan's\nwarning was insufficient. It did not mandate a particular replacement warning, nor did it require contraindicating IV-push\nadministration: “There may have been any number of ways for [Wyeth] to strengthen the Phenergan warning without completely\neliminating IV-push administration.” 183 Vt., at ––––, n. 2, 944 A.2d, at 189, n. 2. We therefore need not decide whether a\nstate rule proscribing intravenous administration would be pre-empted. The narrower question presented is whether federal\nlaw pre-empts Levine's claim that Phenergan's label did not contain an adequate warning about using the IV-push method of\nadministration.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] Our answer to that question must be guided by two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence. First,\n“the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.” Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485,\n116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96,\n103, 84 S.Ct. 219, 11 L.Ed.2d 179 (1963). Second, “[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has\n‘legislated ... in a field which the States have traditionally occupied,’ ... we ‘start with the assumption that the historic police\n **1195 powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose\nof Congress.’ ” Lohr, 518 U.S., at 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct.\n1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947)). 3\n\n3      Wyeth argues that the presumption against pre-emption should not apply to this case because the Federal Government has regulated\n       drug labeling for more than a century. That argument misunderstands the principle: We rely on the presumption because respect for\n       the States as “independent sovereigns in our federal system” leads us to assume that “Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-\n       law causes of action.” Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). The presumption thus\n       accounts for the historic presence of state law but does not rely on the absence of federal regulation.\n          For its part, the dissent argues that the presumption against pre-emption should not apply to claims of implied conflict pre-emption\n          at all, post, at 1228, but this Court has long held to the contrary. See, e.g.,California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 101–\n          102, 109 S.Ct. 1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86 (1989); Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 716,\n          105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985); see also Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U.S. 355, 387, 122 S.Ct. 2151, 153\n          L.Ed.2d 375 (2002). The dissent's reliance on Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm., 531 U.S. 341, 121 S.Ct. 1012, 148 L.Ed.2d\n          854 (2001), see post, at 1229, and n. 14, is especially curious, as that case involved state-law fraud-on-the-agency claims, and the\n          Court distinguished state regulation of health and safety as matters to which the presumption does apply. See 531 U.S., at 347–\n          348, 121 S.Ct. 1012.\n *566 In order to identify the “purpose of Congress,” it is appropriate to briefly review the history of federal regulation of drugs\nand drug labeling. In 1906, Congress enacted its first significant public health law, the Federal Food and Drugs Act, ch. 3915, 34\nStat. 768. The Act, which prohibited the manufacture or interstate shipment of adulterated or misbranded drugs, supplemented\nthe protection for consumers already provided by state regulation and common-law liability. In the 1930's, Congress became\nincreasingly concerned about unsafe drugs and fraudulent marketing, and it enacted the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n(FDCA), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq. The Act's most substantial innovation was its provision\nfor premarket approval of new drugs. It required every manufacturer to submit a new drug application, including reports of\ninvestigations and specimens of proposed labeling, to the FDA for review. Until its application became effective, a manufacturer\nwas prohibited from distributing a drug. The FDA could reject an application if it determined that the drug was not safe for\nuse as labeled, though if the agency failed to act, an application became effective 60 days after the filing. FDCA, § 505(c),\n52 Stat. 1052.\n\n *567 In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA and shifted the burden of proof from the FDA to the manufacturer. Before 1962,\nthe agency had to prove harm to keep a drug out of the market, but the amendments required the manufacturer to demonstrate\nthat its drug was “safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling” before it\ncould distribute the drug. §§ 102(d), 104(b), 76 Stat. 781, 784. In addition, the amendments required the manufacturer to prove\nthe drug's effectiveness by introducing “substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to\nhave under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.” § 102(d), id., at 781.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                        6\n\fWyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555 (2009)\n129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51, 77 USLW 4165, Prod.Liab.Rep. (CCH) P 18,176...\n\nAs it enlarged the FDA's powers to “protect the public health” and “assure the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of **1196\ndrugs,” id., at 780, Congress took care to preserve state law. The 1962 amendments added a saving clause, indicating that\na provision of state law would only be invalidated upon a “direct and positive conflict” with the FDCA. § 202, id., at 793.\nConsistent with that provision, state common-law suits “continued unabated despite ... FDA regulation.” Riegel v. Medtronic,\nInc., 552 U.S. 312, ––––, 128 S.Ct. 999, 1017, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); see ibid., n. 11 (collecting\nstate cases). And when Congress enacted an express pre-emption provision for medical devices in 1976, see § 521, 90 Stat. 574\n(codified at 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a)), it declined to enact such a provision for prescription drugs.\n\nIn 2007, after Levine's injury and lawsuit, Congress again amended the FDCA. 121 Stat. 823. For the first time, it granted the\nFDA statutory authority to require a manufacturer to change its drug label based on safety information that becomes available\nafter a drug's initial approval. § 901(a), id., at 924–926. In doing so, however, Congress did not enact a provision in the Senate\nbill that would have required the FDA to preapprove all changes to drug labels. See S. 1082, 110th Cong., 1st Sess., § 208,\npp. 107–114 (2007) *568 (as passed) (proposing new § 506D). Instead, it adopted a rule of construction to make it clear that\nmanufacturers remain responsible for updating their labels. See 121 Stat. 925–926.\n\n\n\n                                                               III\n\n [5] Wyeth first argues that Levine's state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for it to comply with both the\nstate-law duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties. See de la Cuesta, 458 U.S., at 153, 102 S.Ct. 3014. The\nFDA's premarket approval of a new drug application includes the approval of the exact text in the proposed label. See 21 U.S.C.\n§ 355; 21 CFR § 314.105(b) (2008). Generally speaking, a manufacturer may only change a drug label after the FDA approves\na supplemental application. There is, however, an FDA regulation that permits a manufacturer to make certain changes to its\nlabel before receiving the agency's approval. Among other things, this “changes being effected” (CBE) regulation provides that\nif a manufacturer is changing a label to “add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction” or to\n“add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,”\nit may make the labeling change upon filing its supplemental application with the FDA; it need not wait for FDA approval.\n§§ 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), (C).\n\nWyeth argues that the CBE regulation is not implicated in this case because a 2008 amendment provides that a manufacturer\nmay only change its label “to reflect newly acquired information.” 73 Fed.Reg. 49609. Resting on this language (which Wyeth\nargues simply reaffirmed the interpretation of the regulation in effect when this case was tried), Wyeth contends that it could\nhave changed Phenergan's label only in response to new information that the FDA had not considered. And it maintains that\nLevine has not pointed to any such information concerning the risks of IV-push administration. Thus, Wyeth insists, it was\nimpossible for it *569 to discharge its state-law obligation to provide a stronger warning about IV-push administration without\nviolating federal law. Wyeth's argument misapprehends both the federal drug regulatory scheme and its burden in establishing\na pre-emption defense.\n\nWe need not decide whether the 2008 CBE regulation is consistent with the FDCA and the previous version of the **1197\nregulation, as Wyeth and the United States urge, because Wyeth could have revised Phenergan's label even in accordance with\nthe amended regulation. As the FDA explained in its notice of the final rule, “ ‘newly acquired information’ ” is not limited\nto new data, but also encompasses “new analyses of previously submitted data.” Id., at 49604. The rule accounts for the fact\nthat risk information accumulates over time and that the same data may take on a different meaning in light of subsequent\ndevelopments: “[I]f the sponsor submits adverse event information to FDA, and then later conducts a new analysis of data\nshowing risks of a different type or of greater severity or frequency than did reports previously submitted to FDA, the sponsor\nmeets the requirement for ‘newly acquired information.’ ” Id., at 49607; see also id., at 49606.\n\nThe record is limited concerning what newly acquired information Wyeth had or should have had about the risks of IV-push\nadministration of Phenergan because Wyeth did not argue before the trial court that such information was required for a CBE\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See App. 74, 252. 4 After the first such incident came to Wyeth's attention in 1967,\nit notified the FDA and worked with the agency to change Phenergan's label. *570 In later years, as amputations continued\nto occur, Wyeth could have analyzed the accumulating data and added a stronger warning about IV-push administration of\nthe drug.\n\n4      Levine also introduced evidence that Pfizer had withdrawn Vistaril, another antinausea drug, from intravenous use several decades\n       earlier because its intravenous injection had resulted in gangrene and amputations. See App. 79.\nWyeth argues that if it had unilaterally added such a warning, it would have violated federal law governing unauthorized\ndistribution and misbranding. Its argument that a change in Phenergan's labeling would have subjected it to liability for\nunauthorized distribution rests on the assumption that this labeling change would have rendered Phenergan a new drug lacking\nan effective application. But strengthening the warning about IV-push administration would not have made Phenergan a new\ndrug. See 21 U.S.C. § 321(p)(1) (defining “new drug”); 21 CFR § 310.3(h). Nor would this warning have rendered Phenergan\nmisbranded. The FDCA does not provide that a drug is misbranded simply because the manufacturer has altered an FDA-\napproved label; instead, the misbranding provision focuses on the substance of the label and, among other things, proscribes\nlabels that fail to include “adequate warnings.” 21 U.S.C. § 352(f). Moreover, because the statute contemplates that federal\njuries will resolve most misbranding claims, the FDA's belief that a drug is misbranded is not conclusive. See §§ 331, 332,\n334(a)-(b). And the very idea that the FDA would bring an enforcement action against a manufacturer for strengthening a\nwarning pursuant to the CBE regulation is difficult to accept—neither Wyeth nor the United States has identified a case in\nwhich the FDA has done so.\n\n [6] Wyeth's cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad reading of the FDCA's misbranding and unauthorized\ndistribution provisions are premised on a more fundamental misunderstanding. Wyeth suggests that the FDA, rather than\nthe manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling. Yet through many amendments to the FDCA and to FDA\nregulations, it has remained a central premise of federal drug regulation that the **1198 manufacturer bears responsibility\n *571 for the content of its label at all times. It is charged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings\nremain adequate as long as the drug is on the market. See, e.g., 21 CFR § 201.80(e) (requiring a manufacturer to revise its label\n“to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug”); § 314.80(b)\n(placing responsibility for postmarketing surveillance on the manufacturer); 73 Fed.Reg. 49605 (“Manufacturers continue to\nhave a responsibility under Federal law ... to maintain their labeling and update the labeling with new safety information”).\n\nIndeed, prior to 2007, the FDA lacked the authority to order manufacturers to revise their labels. See 121 Stat. 924–926. When\nCongress granted the FDA this authority, it reaffirmed the manufacturer's obligations and referred specifically to the CBE\nregulation, which both reflects the manufacturer's ultimate responsibility for its label and provides a mechanism for adding\nsafety information to the label prior to FDA approval. See id., at 925–926 (stating that a manufacturer retains the responsibility\n“to maintain its label in accordance with existing requirements, including subpart B of part 201 and sections 314.70 and 601.12\nof title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations)” (emphasis added)). Thus, when the risk of gangrene\nfrom IV-push injection of Phenergan became apparent, Wyeth had a duty to provide a warning that adequately described that\nrisk, and the CBE regulation permitted it to provide such a warning before receiving the FDA's approval.\n\nOf course, the FDA retains authority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation in its review of the\nmanufacturer's supplemental application, just as it retains such authority in reviewing all supplemental applications. But absent\nclear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to Phenergan's label, we will not conclude that it was impossible\nfor Wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements.\n\n*572 Wyeth has offered no such evidence. It does not argue that it attempted to give the kind of warning required by the\nVermont jury but was prohibited from doing so by the FDA. 5 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12–13; see also Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 25.

In its decision on Wyeth's motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, **1199 the trial court found “no evidence in this record that either the FDA or the manufacturer\ngave more than passing attention to the issue of” IV-push versus IV-drip administration. App. 249. The Vermont Supreme Court\nlikewise concluded that the FDA had not made an affirmative decision to preserve the IV-push method or intended to prohibit\nWyeth from strengthening its warning about IV-push administration. 183 Vt., at ––––, 944 A.2d, at 188–189. Moreover, Wyeth\ndoes not argue that it supplied the FDA with an evaluation *573 or analysis concerning the specific dangers posed by the IV-\npush method. We accordingly cannot credit Wyeth's contention that the FDA would have prevented it from adding a stronger\nwarning about the IV-push method of intravenous administration. 6\n\n5      The record would not, in any event, support such an argument. In 1988, Wyeth did propose different language for Phenergan's\n       warning about intra-arterial injection, adapted from revisions the FDA proposed in 1987. See App. 339–341, 311–312. When the\n       FDA approved Wyeth's application, it instructed Wyeth to retain the wording in its current label. During the trial court proceedings,\n       Levine indicated that the language proposed in 1988 would have more strongly warned against IV-push administration. But the trial\n       court and the Vermont Supreme Court found that the 1988 warning did not differ in any material respect from the FDA-approved\n       warning. See 183 Vt. 76, ––––, 944 A.2d 179, 189 (2006) (“Simply stated, the proposed warning was different, but not stronger.\n       It was also no longer or more prominent than the original warning ...”); App. 248–250. Indeed, the United States concedes that the\n       FDA did not regard the proposed warning as substantively different: “[I]t appears the FDA viewed the change as non-substantive\n       and rejected it for formatting reasons.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25; see also 183 Vt., at ––––, 944 A.2d, at 189.\n6      The dissent's suggestion that the FDA intended to prohibit Wyeth from strengthening its warning does not fairly reflect the record.\n       The dissent creatively paraphrases a few FDA orders—for instance by conflating warnings about IV-push administration and intra-\n       arterial injection, see, e.g., post, at 1222, 1223 – 1224, 1225 – 1226—to suggest greater agency attention to the question, and it\n       undertakes a study of Phenergan's labeling that is more elaborate than any FDA order. But even the dissent's account does not support\n       the conclusion that the FDA would have prohibited Wyeth from adding a stronger warning pursuant to the CBE regulation.\nImpossibility pre-emption is a demanding defense. On the record before us, Wyeth has failed to demonstrate that it was\nimpossible for it to comply with both federal and state requirements. The CBE regulation permitted Wyeth to unilaterally\nstrengthen its warning, and the mere fact that the FDA approved Phenergan's label does not establish that it would have\nprohibited such a change.\n\n\n\n                                                                   IV\n\n [7] Wyeth also argues that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning about IV-push\nadministration would obstruct the purposes and objectives of federal drug labeling regulation. Levine's tort claims, it maintains,\nare pre-empted because they interfere with “Congress's purpose to entrust an expert agency to make drug labeling decisions\nthat strike a balance between competing objectives.” Brief for Petitioner 46. We find no merit in this argument, which relies on\nan untenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency's power to pre-empt state law.\n\nWyeth contends that the FDCA establishes both a floor and a ceiling for drug regulation: Once the FDA has approved *574\na drug's label, a state-law verdict may not deem the label inadequate, regardless of whether there is any evidence that the FDA\nhas considered the stronger warning at issue. The most glaring problem with this argument is that all evidence of Congress'\npurposes is to the contrary. Building on its 1906 Act, Congress enacted the FDCA to bolster consumer protection against harmful\nproducts. See Kordel v. United States, 335 U.S. 345, 349, 69 S.Ct. 106, 93 L.Ed. 52 (1948);United States v. Sullivan, 332 U.S.\n689, 696, 68 S.Ct. 331, 92 L.Ed. 297 (1948). Congress did not provide a federal remedy for consumers harmed by unsafe or\nineffective drugs in the 1938 statute or in any subsequent amendment. Evidently, it determined that widely available state rights\nof action provided appropriate relief for injured consumers. 7 It may also have recognized that **1200 state-law remedies\nfurther consumer protection by motivating manufacturers to produce safe and effective drugs and to give adequate warnings.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(CCH) P 18,176...\n\n7      Although the first version of the bill that became the FDCA would have provided a federal cause of action for damages for injured\n       consumers, see H.R. 6110, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., § 25 (1933) (as introduced), witnesses testified that such a right of action was\n       unnecessary because common-law claims were already available under state law. See Hearings on S.1944 before a Subcommittee of\n       the Senate Committee on Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 400 (1933) (statement of W.A. Hines); see id., at 403 (statement of J.A.\n       Ladds) (“This act should not attempt to modify or restate the common law with respect to personal injuries”).\n [8] If Congress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an express pre-emption\nprovision at some point during the FDCA's 70–year history. But despite its 1976 enactment of an express pre-emption provision\nfor medical devices, see § 521, 90 Stat. 574 (codified at 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a)), Congress has not enacted such a provision for\nprescription drugs. See Riegel, 552 U.S., at ––––, 128 S.Ct., at 1009 (“Congress could have applied the pre-emption clause\nto the entire FDCA. It did not do so, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies only to medical devices *575 ”). 8\nIts silence on the issue, coupled with its certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation, is powerful evidence that\nCongress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness. As Justice O'Connor\nexplained in her opinion for a unanimous Court: “The case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has\nindicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both\nconcepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S.\n141, 166–167, 109 S.Ct. 971, 103 L.Ed.2d 118 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also supra, at 1194 (discussing\nthe presumption against pre-emption).\n\n8      In 1997, Congress pre-empted certain state requirements concerning over-the-counter medications and cosmetics but expressly\n       preserved product liability actions. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 379r(e), 379s(d) (“Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or\n       otherwise affect any action or the liability of any person under the product liability law of any State”).\n [9] Despite this evidence that Congress did not regard state tort litigation as an obstacle to achieving its purposes, Wyeth\nnonetheless maintains that, because the FDCA requires the FDA to determine that a drug is safe and effective under the\nconditions set forth in its labeling, the agency must be presumed to have performed a precise balancing of risks and benefits\nand to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments. In advancing this\nargument, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress, but instead on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation governing the\ncontent and format of prescription drug labels. See Brief for Petitioner 8, 11, 42, 45, and 50 (citing 71 Fed.Reg. 3922 (2006)). In\nthat preamble, the FDA declared that the FDCA establishes “both a ‘floor’ and a ‘ceiling,’ ” so that “FDA approval of labeling ...\npreempts conflicting or contrary State law.” Id., at 3934–3935. It further stated that certain state-law actions, such as those\ninvolving failure-to-warn claims, “threaten FDA's statutorily *576 prescribed role as the expert Federal agency responsible\nfor evaluating and regulating drugs.” Id., at 3935.\n\nThis Court has recognized that an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements. See,\ne.g.,Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000); Hillsborough County v.\nAutomated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 713, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). In such cases, the Court\nhas **1201 performed its own conflict determination, relying on the substance of state and federal law and not on agency\nproclamations of pre-emption. We are faced with no such regulation in this case, but rather with an agency's mere assertion\nthat state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives. Because Congress has not authorized the FDA to pre-empt\nstate law directly, cf. 21 U.S.C. § 360k (authorizing the FDA to determine the scope of the Medical Devices Amendments' pre-\nemption clause), 9 the question is what weight we should accord the FDA's opinion.\n\n9      For similar examples, see 47 U.S.C. §§ 253(a), (d) (2000 ed.) (authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to pre-empt “any\n       [state] statute, regulation, or legal requirement” that “may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide\n       any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service”); 30 U.S.C. § 1254(g) (2006 ed.) (pre-empting any statute that conflicts with\n       “the purposes and the requirements of this chapter” and permitting the Secretary of the Interior to “set forth any State law or regulation\n       which is preempted and superseded”); and 49 U.S.C. § 5125(d) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (authorizing the Secretary of Transportation\n       to decide whether a state or local statute that conflicts with the regulation of hazardous waste transportation is pre-empted).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Even in such cases, however, we have not deferred to an agency's conclusion that state law is pre-empted.\nRather, we have attended to an agency's explanation of how state law affects the regulatory scheme. While *577 agencies\nhave no special authority to pronounce on pre-emption absent delegation by Congress, they do have a unique understanding of\nthe statutes they administer and an attendant ability to make informed determinations about how state requirements may pose\nan “obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines, 312 U.S, at 67, 61\nS.Ct. 399; see Geier, 529 U.S., at 883, 120 S.Ct. 1913;Lohr, 518 U.S., at 495–496, 116 S.Ct. 2240. The weight we accord the\nagency's explanation of state law's impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness.\nCf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 234–235, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001); Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).\n\nUnder this standard, the FDA's 2006 preamble does not merit deference. When the FDA issued its notice of proposed rulemaking\nin December 2000, it explained that the rule would “not contain policies that have federalism implications or that preempt State\nlaw.” 65 Fed.Reg. 81103; see also 71 id., at 3969 (noting that the “proposed rule did not propose to preempt state law”). In\n2006, the agency finalized the rule and, without offering States or other interested parties notice or opportunity for comment,\narticulated a sweeping position on the FDCA's pre-emptive effect in the regulatory preamble. The agency's views on state law\nare inherently suspect in light of this procedural failure.\n\nFurther, the preamble is at odds with what evidence we have of Congress' purposes, and it reverses the FDA's own longstanding\nposition without providing a reasoned explanation, including any discussion of how state law has interfered with the FDA's\nregulation of drug labeling during decades of coexistence. The FDA's 2006 position plainly does not reflect the agency's own\nview at all times relevant to this litigation. Not once prior to Levine's injury **1202 did the FDA suggest that state tort law\nstood as an obstacle to its statutory mission. To the contrary, it cast federal labeling standards as a floor upon which States could\nbuild and repeatedly disclaimed *578 any attempt to pre-empt failure-to-warn claims. For instance, in 1998, the FDA stated\nthat it did “not believe that the evolution of state tort law [would] cause the development of standards that would be at odds\nwith the agency's regulations.” 63 id., at 66384. It further noted that, in establishing “ minimal standards” for drug labels, it did\nnot intend “to preclude the states from imposing additional labeling requirements.” Ibid. 10\n\n10     See also 44 Fed.Reg. 37437 (1979) (“It is not the intent of the FDA to influence the civil tort liability of the manufacturer”);\n       59 Fed.Reg. 3948 (1994) (“[P]roduct liability plays an important role in consumer protection”); Porter, The LohrDecision: FDA\n       Perspective and Position, 52 Food & Drug L.J. 7, 10 (1997) (former chief counsel to the FDA stating that the FDA regarded state\n       law as complementing the agency's mission of consumer protection).\nIn keeping with Congress' decision not to pre-empt common-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA traditionally regarded state\nlaw as a complementary form of drug regulation. The FDA has limited resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market, 11\nand manufacturers have superior access *579 to information about their drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new\nrisks emerge. State tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety\nrisks promptly. They also serve a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured persons to come forward with\ninformation. Failure-to-warn actions, in particular, lend force to the FDCA's premise that manufacturers, not the FDA, bear\nprimary responsibility for their drug labeling at all times. Thus, the FDA long maintained that state law offers an additional, and\nimportant, layer of consumer protection that complements FDA regulation. **1203 12 The agency's 2006 preamble represents\na dramatic change in position.\n\n11     In 1955, the same year that the agency approved Wyeth's Phenergan application, an FDA advisory committee issued a report\n       finding “conclusively” that “the budget and staff of the Food and Drug Administration are inadequate to permit the discharge of\n       its existing responsibilities for the protection of the American public.” Citizens Advisory Committee on the FDA, Report to the\n       Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, H.R.

There, we held that state tort claims premised on Honda's failure to install airbags conflicted with a\nfederal regulation that did not require airbags for all cars. The Department of Transportation *580 (DOT) had promulgated a\nrule that provided car manufacturers with a range of choices among passive restraint devices. Geier, 529 U.S., at 875, 120 S.Ct.\n1913. Rejecting an “ ‘all airbag’ ” standard, the agency had called for a gradual phase-in of a mix of passive restraints in order\nto spur technological development and win consumer acceptance. Id., at 879, 120 S.Ct. 1913. Because the plaintiff's claim was\nthat car manufacturers had a duty to install airbags, it presented an obstacle to achieving “the variety and mix of devices that\nthe federal regulation sought.” Id., at 881, 120 S.Ct. 1913.\n\nWyeth and the dissent contend that the regulatory scheme in this case is nearly identical, but, as we have described, it is quite\ndifferent. In Geier, the DOT conducted a formal rulemaking and then adopted a plan to phase in a mix of passive restraint\ndevices. Examining the rule itself and the DOT's contemporaneous record, which revealed the factors the agency had weighed\nand the balance it had struck, we determined that state tort suits presented an obstacle to the federal scheme. After conducting\nour own pre-emption analysis, we considered the agency's explanation of how state law interfered with its regulation, regarding\nit as further support for our independent conclusion that the plaintiff's tort claim obstructed the federal regime.\n\nBy contrast, we have no occasion in this case to consider the pre-emptive effect of a specific agency regulation bearing the\nforce of law. And the FDA's newfound opinion, expressed in its 2006 preamble, that state law “frustrate[s] the agency's\nimplementation of its statutory mandate,” 71 Fed.Reg. 3934, does not merit deference for the reasons we have explained. 13\nIndeed, the “complex and extensive” regulatory *581 history and background relevant to this case, Geier, 529 U.S., at 883,\n120 S.Ct. 1913, undercut the FDA's recent pronouncements of pre-emption, as they reveal the longstanding coexistence of\nstate and federal law and the FDA's traditional recognition of state-law remedies—a recognition in place each time the agency\nreviewed Wyeth's Phenergan label. 14\n\n13     The United States' amicus brief is similarly undeserving of deference. Unlike the Government's brief in Geier v. American Honda\n       Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000), which explained the effects of state law on the DOT's regulation\n       in a manner consistent with the agency's prior accounts, see id., at 861, 120 S.Ct. 1913, the Government's explanation of federal drug\n       regulation departs markedly from the FDA's understanding at all times relevant to this case.\n14     Wyeth's more specific contention—that this case resembles Geier because the FDA determined that no additional warning on IV-\n       push administration was needed, thereby setting a ceiling on Phenergan's label—is belied by the record. As we have discussed, the\n       FDA did not consider and reject a stronger warning against IV-push injection of Phenergan.

Congress has repeatedly declined to pre-empt state law, and the FDA's recently adopted position that state tort suits\ninterfere with its statutory mandate is entitled to no weight. Although we recognize that some state-law claims might well\nfrustrate the achievement of congressional objectives, this is not such a case.\n\n\n\n                                                                     V\n\nWe conclude that it is not impossible for Wyeth to comply with its state and federal law obligations and that Levine's common-\nlaw claims do not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress' purposes in the FDCA. Accordingly, the judgment\nof the Vermont Supreme Court is affirmed.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\nJustice BREYER, concurring.\nI write separately to emphasize the Court's statement that “we have no occasion in this case to consider the pre-emptive effect\nof a specific agency regulation bearing the force of law.” Ante, at 1203. State tort law will sometimes help the *582 Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) “uncover unknown drug hazards and [encourage] drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks.”\nAnte, at 1202. But it is also possible that state tort law will sometimes interfere with the FDA's desire to create a drug label\ncontaining a specific set of cautions and instructions. I also note that some have argued that state tort law can sometimes raise\nprices to the point where those who are sick are unable to obtain the drugs they need. See Lasagna, The Chilling Effect of Product\nLiability on New Drug Development, in The Liability Maze 334, 335–336 (P. Huber & R. Litan eds.1991). The FDA may seek\nto determine whether and when state tort law acts as a help or a hindrance to achieving the safe drug-related medical care that\nCongress sought. Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 506, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (BREYER, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.S. 431, 454–455, 125 S.Ct. 1788, 161 L.Ed.2d\n687 (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring). It may seek to embody those determinations in lawful specific regulations describing,\nfor example, when labeling requirements serve as a ceiling as well as a floor. And it is possible that such determinations would\nhave pre-emptive effect. See Lohr, supra, at 505, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of BREYER, J.) (citing Hillsborough County v.\nAutomated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985)). I agree with the Court, however,\nthat such a regulation is not at issue in this case.\n\n\nJustice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.\nI agree with the Court that the fact that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the label for petitioner Wyeth's\ndrug Phenergan does not pre-empt the state-law judgment before the Court. That judgment was based on a jury finding that the\nlabel did not adequately warn of the risk involved in administering Phenergan through the IV-push injection method. Under\nfederal law, without prior approval from the FDA, Wyeth could have “add[ed] or strengthen[ed]” information on its label about\n“a contraindication, *583 warning, precaution, or adverse reaction,” **1205 21 CFR § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A) (2008), or “about\ndosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,” § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to\n“reflect newly acquired information,” including “new analyses of previously submitted data,” about the dangers of IV-push\nadministration of Phenergan, 73 Fed.Reg. 49603, 49609 (2008). It thus was possible for Wyeth to label and market Phenergan in\ncompliance with federal law while also providing additional warning information on its label beyond that previously approved\nby the FDA. In addition, federal law does not give drug manufacturers an unconditional right to market their federally approved\ndrug at all times with the precise label initially approved by the FDA. The Vermont court's judgment in this case, therefore,\ndid not directly conflict with federal law and is not pre-empted.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In particular, I have become increasingly skeptical of this Court's “purposes and objectives” pre-emption\njurisprudence. Under this approach, the Court routinely invalidates state laws based on perceived conflicts with broad federal\npolicy objectives, legislative history, or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are not embodied within the text of\nfederal law. Because implied pre-emption doctrines that wander far from the statutory text are inconsistent with the Constitution,\nI concur only in the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                                  I\n\n\n                                                                  A\n\nIn order “to ensure the protection of our fundamental liberties,” Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 242, 105\nS.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted), the “Constitution establishes a system of dual sovereignty\nbetween the States and the Federal Government.” *584 Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 457, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d\n410 (1991). The Framers adopted this “ ‘constitutionally mandated balance of power,’ ” Atascadero State Hospital, supra,\nat 242, 105 S.Ct. 3142, to “reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front,” because a “federalist structure of joint\nsovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages,” such as “a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to\nthe diverse needs of a heterogeneous society” and “increase[d] opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes,”\nGregory, supra, at 458, 111 S.Ct. 2395. Furthermore, as the Framers observed, the “ compound republic of America” provides\n“a double security ... to the rights of the people” because “the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two\ndistinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments.” The Federalist\nNo. 51, p. 266 (M. Beloff ed., 2d ed.1987).\n\nUnder this federalist system, “the States possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the Federal Government, subject only to\nlimitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458, 110 S.Ct. 792, 107 L.Ed.2d 887 (1990). In\nthis way, the Supremacy Clause gives the Federal Government “a decided advantage in [a] delicate balance” between federal\nand state sovereigns. Gregory, 501 U.S., at 460, 111 S.Ct. 2395. “As long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the\nConstitution, Congress may impose its will on the States.” Ibid. That is an “extraordinary power in a federalist system.” Ibid.\n\nNonetheless, the States retain substantial sovereign authority. U.S. Const., Amdt. 10 (“The powers not delegated to **1206\nthe United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people”);\nsee also Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 918–\n922, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997); New York v.

In accordance with the text and\nstructure of the Constitution, “[t]he powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the *585 federal government, are few\nand defined” and “[t]hose which are to remain in the state governments, are numerous and indefinite.” The Federalist No. 45,\nat 237–238. Indeed, in protecting our constitutional government, “the preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their\ngovernments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance\nof the National government.” Texas v.

United States,\nsupra, at 162, 112 S.Ct. 2408.\n\nAs a result, in order to protect the delicate balance of power mandated by the Constitution, the Supremacy Clause must operate\nonly in accordance with its terms. The clause provides:\n\n  “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or\n  which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every\n  State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.”Art.

(CCH) P 18,176...\n\n\nWith respect to federal laws, then, the Supremacy Clause gives “supreme” status only to those that are “made in Pursuance”\nof “[t]his Constitution.” Ibid.; see 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1831, p. 694 (1833)\n(hereinafter Story) (“It will be observed, that the supremacy of the laws is attached to those only, which are made in pursuance\nof the constitution”).\n\nFederal laws “made in Pursuance” of the Constitution must comply with two key structural limitations in the Constitution that\nensure that the Federal Government does not amass too much power at the expense of the States. The first structural limitation,\nwhich the parties have not raised in this case, is “the Constitution's conferral upon Congress of not all governmental powers, but\nonly discrete, enumerated ones.” Printz,supra, at 919, 117 S.Ct. 2365; see also United States v. Morrison, *586 529 U.S. 598,\n618, n. 8, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000); New York v. United States, supra, at 155–157, 112 S.Ct. 2408;McCulloch v.\nMaryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819) (“This government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers”). 1\n\n1      This structural limitation may be implicated in a pre-emption case if the federal law at issue is beyond the scope of Congress'\n       enumerated powers. Expansion of congressional power through an “increasingly generous ... interpretation of the commerce power\n       of Congress,” for example, creates “a real risk that Congress will gradually erase the diffusion of power between State and Nation\n       on which the Framers based their faith in the efficiency and vitality of our Republic.” Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit\n       Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 583–584, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see also Marbury v. Madison,\n       1 Cranch 137, 176, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) (“The powers of the legislature are defined, and limited; and that those limits may not be\n       mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written”).\nThe second structural limitation is the complex set of procedures that Congress **1207 and the President must follow to enact\n“Laws of the United States.” See INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 945–946, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983) (setting forth\nthe Constitution's Bicameral and Presentment Clauses, Art. I, § 7, cls. 2–3, which “prescribe and define the respective functions\nof the Congress and of the Executive in the legislative process”). “[T]he Framers were acutely conscious that the bicameral\nrequirement and the Presentment Clauses would serve essential constitutional functions,” Chadha, 462 U.S., at 951, 103 S.Ct.\n2764, by allowing the passage of legislation only after it has proceeded through “a step-by-step, deliberate and deliberative\nprocess,” id., at 959, 103 S.Ct. 2764, that was “finely wrought and exhaustively considered” by the Framers, id., at 951, 103\nS.Ct. 2764. The Supremacy Clause thus requires that pre-emptive effect be given only those to federal standards and policies that\nare set forth in, or necessarily follow from, the statutory text that was produced through the constitutionally required bicameral\nand presentment procedures. See 3 J. Story § 1831, at 694 (Actions of the Federal Government “which are not pursuant to its\nconstitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies,” are not “the *587 supreme\nlaw of the land. They will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such”).\n\n\n\n                                                                  B\n\nIn light of these constitutional principles, I have become “increasing[ly] reluctan[t] to expand federal statutes beyond their terms\nthrough doctrines of implied pre-emption.” Bates v.

My review of this Court's broad implied\npre-emption precedents, particularly its “purposes and objectives” pre-emption jurisprudence, has increased my concerns that\nimplied pre-emption doctrines have not always been constitutionally applied. Under the vague and “potentially boundless”\ndoctrine of “purposes and objectives” pre-emption, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 907, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146\nL.Ed.2d 914 (2000) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), for example, the Court has pre-empted state law based on its interpretation of\nbroad federal policy objectives, legislative history, or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are not contained within\nthe text of federal law. See, e.g.,Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644, 678, 123 S.Ct. 1855,\n155 L.Ed.2d 889 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (referring to the “concomitant danger of invoking obstacle\npre-emption based on the arbitrary selection of one purpose to the exclusion of others”); Crosby v.

I, § 7 requirements for enactment of federal law and,\ntherefore, do not pre-empt state law under the Supremacy *588 Clause. When analyzing the pre-emptive effect of federal\nstatutes or regulations validly promulgated thereunder, “[e]vidence of pre-emptive purpose [must be] sought in the text and\nstructure of the [provision] at issue” to comply with the Constitution. **1208 CSX Transp., Inc. v.

Pre-\nemption analysis should not be “a freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal objectives,\nbut an inquiry into whether the ordinary meanings of state and federal law conflict.” Bates, supra, at 459, 125 S.Ct. 1788\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also\nGeier, supra, at 911, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“[P]re-emption analysis is, or at least should be, a matter of\nprecise statutory [or regulatory] construction rather than an exercise in free-form judicial policymaking” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Pre-emption must turn on whether state law conflicts with the text of the relevant federal statute or with the\nfederal regulations authorized by that text. See Foster v.

First, the Court has found pre-emption “where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical\nimpossibility for one engaged in interstate commerce.” Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142–143,\n83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963). Second, the Court has determined that federal law pre-empts state law when, “under the\ncircumstances of [a] particular case, [state] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes\nand objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941). 2\n\n2      The majority's pre-emption analysis relies in part on a presumption against pre-emption. Ante, at 1194, and n. 3 (opinion of STEVENS,\n       J.). Because it is evident from the text of the relevant federal statutes and regulations themselves that the state-law judgment below\n       is not pre-empted, it is not necessary to decide whether, or to what extent, the presumption should apply in a case such as this one,\n       where Congress has not enacted an express-pre-emption clause. Cf. Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U.S. 70, ––––, 129 S.Ct. 538,\n       551–552, 172 L.Ed.2d 398 (2008) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (rejecting the use of a presumption against pre-emption in express pre-\n       emption cases).\n\n\n\n                                                                    A\n\nWyeth first contends that “it would have been impossible for it to comply with the state-law duty to modify Phenergan's labeling\nwithout violating federal law.” Ante, at 1193 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.).

See, e.g.,Geier, supra, at 873, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (“a case in which\nstate law penalizes what federal law requires”); American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524\nU.S. 214, 227, 118 S.Ct. 1956, 141 L.Ed.2d 222 (1998)(AT & T) (when state-law claims “directly conflict” with federal law),\ncited in Geier, supra, at 874, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (describing AT & T as a “cas[e] involving impossibility”); Florida *590 Lime &\nAvocado Growers, supra, at 142–143, 83 S.Ct. 1210 (“where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical\nimpossibility”). The Court has generally articulated a very narrow “impossibility standard,” see Crosby, 530 U.S., at 372–373,\n120 S.Ct. 2288 (citing Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, supra, at 142–143, 83 S.Ct. 1210); see also Sprietsma v.

There could be instances where it is not “physically\nimpossible” to comply with both state and federal law, even when the state and federal laws give directly conflicting commands.\nSee Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L.Rev. 225, 260–261 (2000). For example, if federal law gives an individual the right to\nengage in certain behavior that state law prohibits, the laws would give contradictory commands notwithstanding the fact that\nan individual could comply with both by electing to refrain from the covered behavior. Ibid. Therefore, “physical impossibility”\nmay not be the most appropriate standard for determining whether the text of state and federal laws directly conflict. See ibid.\n(concluding that the Supremacy Clause does not limit direct conflicts to cases with “physically impossible” conflicts and arguing\nthat evidence from the Founding supports a standard of “logical-contradiction”); see also AT & T, supra, at 227, 118 S.Ct. 1956\n(requiring that the state-law claims “directly conflict” with federal law); 3 Story § 1836, at 701 (suggesting instead that a state\nlaw is pre-empted by the Supremacy Clause when it is “repugnant to the constitution of the United States” (emphasis added)).\n\n *591 Nonetheless, whatever the precise constitutional contours of implied pre-emption may be, I am satisfied that it does not\noperate against respondent's judgment below. The text of the federal laws at issue do not require that the state-court judgment\nat issue be pre-empted, under either the narrow “physical impossibility” standard, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers,supra, at\n142–143, 83 S.Ct. 1210, or a more general “direc[t] conflict” standard, AT & T,supra, at 227, 118 S.Ct. 1956.\n\nUnder the FDA's “changes being effected” regulation, 21 CFR § 314.70(c)(6)(iii), which was promulgated pursuant to the\nFDA's statutory authority, it is physically possible for Wyeth to market Phenergan in compliance with federal and Vermont law.\nAs the majority explains, Wyeth could have changed the warning on its label regarding IV-push without violating federal law.\nSee ante, at 1196 – 1197. The “changes being effected” regulation allows drug manufacturers to change their labels without the\nFDA's preapproval if the changes “add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse **1210 reaction,” §\n314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), or “add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe\nuse of the drug product,” § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to “reflect newly acquired information,” including “new analyses of\npreviously submitted data,” 73 Fed.Reg. 49603, 49609. Under the terms of these regulations, after learning of new incidences\nof gangrene-induced amputation resulting from the IV-push administration of Phenergan, see ante, at 1196 – 1197, federal law\ngave Wyeth the authority to change Phenergan's label to “strengthen a ... warning,” “strengthen a ... precaution,” § 314.70(c)\n(6)(iii)(A), or to “strengthen an instruction about ... administration [of the IV-push method] ... to increase the safe use of the\ndrug product,” § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C). Thus, it was physically possible for Wyeth to comply with a state-law requirement to\nprovide stronger warnings on Phenergan about the risks of the IV-push administration method *592 while continuing to market\nPhenergan in compliance with federal law.\n\nIn addition, the text of the statutory provisions governing FDA drug labeling, and the regulations promulgated thereunder,\ndo not give drug manufacturers an unconditional right to market their federally approved drug at all times with the precise\nlabel initially approved by the FDA. Thus, there is no “direct conflict” between the federal labeling law and the state-court\njudgment. The statute prohibits the interstate marketing of any drug, except for those that are federally approved. See 21 U.S.C.\n§ 355(a) (“No person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug, unless an approval of\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(CCH) P 18,176...\n\nan application filed pursuant to subsection (b) or (j) of this section is effective with respect to such drug” (emphasis added)).\nTo say, as the statute does, that Wyeth may not market a drug without federal approval (i.e., without an FDA-approved label)\nis not to say that federal approval gives Wyeth the unfettered right, for all time, to market its drug with the specific label that\nwas federally approved. Initial approval of a label amounts to a finding by the FDA that the label is safe for purposes of gaining\nfederal approval to market the drug. It does not represent a finding that the drug, as labeled, can never be deemed unsafe by\nlater federal action, or as in this case, the application of state law.\n\nInstead, FDA regulations require a drug manufacturer—after initial federal approval of a drug's label—to revise the federally\napproved label “to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a\ndrug.”21 CFR § 201.80(e). Drug manufacturers are also required to “establish and maintain records and make reports” to the\nFDA about “[a]ny adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related,” after it\nhas received federal approval. §§ 314.80(a), (c), (j). In addition, the manufacturer must make periodic reports about “adverse\ndrug experience *593 [s]” associated with its drug and include “a history of actions taken since the last report because of\nadverse drug experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated).” §§ 314.80(c)(2)(i)-(ii). When such records and\nreports are not made, the FDA can withdraw its approval of the drug. § 314.80(j); see also 21 U.S.C. § 355(e) (“The Secretary\nmay ... withdraw the approval of an application ... if the Secretary finds ... that the applicant has failed to establish a system for\nmaintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make required reports”).\nThe FDA may also determine that a drug is no longer safe for use based on “clinical or other experience, tests, or other scientific\n **1211 data.” Ibid. (approval may be withdrawn if “the Secretary finds ... that clinical or other experience, tests, or other\nscientific data show that such drug is unsafe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the application was\napproved”).\n\nThe text of the statutory provisions and the accompanying regulatory scheme governing the FDA drug approval process,\ntherefore, establish that the FDA's initial approval of a drug is not a guarantee that the drug's label will never need to be changed.\nAnd nothing in the text of the statutory or regulatory scheme necessarily insulates Wyeth from liability under state law simply\nbecause the FDA has approved a particular label.\n\nIn sum, the relevant federal law did not give Wyeth a right that the state-law judgment took away, and it was possible for\nWyeth to comply with both federal law and the Vermont-law judgment at issue here. The federal statute and regulations neither\nprohibited the stronger warning label required by the state judgment, nor insulated Wyeth from the risk of state-law liability.\nWith no “direct conflict” between the federal and state law, then, the state-law judgment is not pre-empted. Cf. AT & T, 524 U.S.,\nat 221–226, 118 S.Ct. 1956 (finding pre-emption where federal law forbade common carriers from extending communications\nprivileges requested by state-law *594 claims); Foster, 522 U.S., at 68–69, 118 S.Ct. 464 (finding pre-emption where the\nfederal statute required congressional elections on a particular date different from that provided by state statute).\n\n\n\n                                                                  B\n\nWyeth also contends that state and federal law conflict because “recognition of [this] state tort action creates an unacceptable\n‘obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,’ Hines v. Davidowitz, 312\nU.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941), because it substitutes a lay jury's decision about drug labeling for the expert\njudgment of the FDA.” Ante, at 1193 – 1194. This Court's entire body of “purposes and objectives” pre-emption jurisprudence\nis inherently flawed. The cases improperly rely on legislative history, broad atextual notions of congressional purpose, and even\ncongressional inaction in order to pre-empt state law. See supra, at 1192 – 1194.

The\nCourt did not find that the two statutes, by their terms, directly conflicted. See Hines, supra, at 59–60, and n. 1, 61 S.Ct. 399\n(citing Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, §§ 1801–1806 (Purdon Supp.1940)); 312 U.S., at 60, and n. 5, 61 S.Ct. 399 (citing Act of June\n28, 1940, 54 Stat. 670); 312 U.S., at 69–74, 61 S.Ct. 399 (analyzing numerous extratextual sources and finding pre-emption\nwithout *595 concluding that the terms of the federal and state laws directly conflict); see also id., at 78, 61 S.Ct. 399 (noting\nthat “[i]t is conceded that the federal **1212 act in operation does not at any point conflict with the state statute” (Stone,\nJ., dissenting)). 3 Nonetheless, the Court determined that it was not confined to considering merely the terms of the relevant\nfederal law in conducting its pre-emption analysis. Rather, it went on to ask whether the state law “stands as an obstacle to the\naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Id., at 67, 61 S.Ct. 399.\n\n3      According to the Court, the Pennsylvania Act required:\n         “every alien 18 years or over, with certain exceptions, to register once each year; provide such information as is required by\n         the statute, plus any ‘other information and details' that the Department of Labor and Industry may direct; pay $1 as an annual\n         registration fee; receive an alien identification card and carry it at all times; show the card whenever it may be demanded by any\n         police officer or any agent of the Department of Labor and Industry; and exhibit the card as a condition precedent to registering\n         a motor vehicle in his name or obtaining a license to operate one. ... Nonexempt aliens who fail to register are subject to a fine ...\n         or imprisonment .... For failure to carry an identification card or for failure to show it upon proper demand, the punishment is a\n         fine ... or imprisonment ....” Hines, 312 U.S., at 59–60, 61 S.Ct. 399 (footnote omitted).\n         The Court explained that the federal Alien Registration Act required:\n         “a single registration of aliens 14 years of age and over; detailed information specified by the Act, plus ‘such additional matters as\n         may be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Attorney General’; finger-printing of all registrants; and secrecy\n         of the federal files .... No requirement that aliens carry a registration card to be exhibited to police or others is embodied in the\n         law, and only the wilful failure to register is made a criminal offense ....” Id., at 60–61, 61 S.Ct. 399.\nIn so doing, the Court looked far beyond the relevant federal statutory text and instead embarked on its own freeranging\nspeculation about what the purposes of the federal law must have been. See id., at 69–74, 61 S.Ct. 399. In addition to the meaning\nof the relevant federal text, the Court attempted to discern “[t]he nature of the power exerted by Congress, the object sought to\nbe attained, and the character of the obligations *596 imposed by the law.” Id., at 70, 61 S.Ct. 399. To do so, the Court looked\nin part to public sentiment, noting that “[o]pposition to laws ... singling out aliens as particularly dangerous and undesirable\ngroups, is deep-seated in this country.” Ibid. The Court also relied on statements by particular Members of Congress and on\ncongressional inaction, finding it pertinent that numerous bills with requirements similar to Pennsylvania's law had failed to\ngarner enough votes in Congress to become law. Id., at 71–73, and nn. 32–34, 61 S.Ct. 399. Concluding that these sources\nrevealed a federal purpose to “protect the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration\nsystem,” the Court held that the Pennsylvania law was pre-empted. Id., at 74, 61 S.Ct. 399.\n\nJustice Stone, in dissent, questioned the majority's decision to read an exclusive registration system for aliens into a statute\nthat did not specifically provide such exclusivity. See id., at 75, 61 S.Ct. 399. He noted his concern that state power would\nbe improperly diminished through a pre-emption doctrine driven by the Court's “own conceptions of a policy which Congress\nha[d] not expressed and which is not plainly to be inferred from the legislation which it ha[d] enacted.” Ibid. In his view,\nnothing that Congress enacted had “denie[d] the states the practicable means of identifying their alien residents and of recording\ntheir whereabouts.” Id., at 78, 61 S.Ct. 399. Yet, the Hines majority employed pre-emption to override numerous state alien-\nregistration laws even though enacted federal law “at no point conflict[ed] with the state legislation and [was] **1213\nharmonious with it.” Id., at 79, 61 S.Ct. 399. 4\n\n4      According to Justice Stone, the Hines majority's analysis resembled an inquiry into whether the federal act “ ‘occupied the field,’\n       ” rather than an application of simple conflict pre-emption principles. Id., at 78, 61 S.Ct. 399 (dissenting opinion). Regardless of\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id., at 78–79, 61 S.Ct. 399. See also Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 616–\n       617, 117 S.Ct. 1590, 137 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (noting that “field pre-emption is itself suspect, at least as\n       applied in the absence of a congressional command that a particular field be pre-empted”).\n\n\n\n                                                                   *597 2\n\nThe consequences of this Court's broad approach to “purposes and objectives” pre-emption are exemplified in this Court's\ndecision in Geier, which both the majority and the dissent incorporate into their analysis today. See ante, at 1202 – 1203, and nn.\n13–14; post, at 1220 – 1222 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In Geier, pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of\n1966 (Safety Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U.S.C. § 1381 et seq. (1988 ed.), the Department of Transportation (DOT) had promulgated\na Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard that “required auto manufacturers to equip some but not all of their 1987 vehicles\nwith passive restraints.” 529 U.S., at 864–865, 120 S.Ct. 1913. The case required this Court to decide whether the Safety Act\npre-empted a state common-law tort action in which the plaintiff claimed that an auto manufacturer, though in compliance with\nthe federal standard, should nonetheless have equipped a 1987 automobile with airbags. Id., at 865, 120 S.Ct. 1913. The Court\nfirst concluded that the Safety Act's express pre-emption provision and its saving clause, read together, did not expressly pre-\nempt state common-law claims. See id., at 867–868, 120 S.Ct. 1913. 5 The Court *598 then proceeded to consider whether\nthe state action was nonetheless pre-empted as an “obstacle” to the purposes of the federal law. The Court held that the state\ntort claim was pre-empted, relying in large part on comments that DOT made when promulgating its regulation, statements that\nthe Government made in its brief to the Court, and regulatory history that related to the federal regulation of passive restraints.\nSee id., at 874–886, 120 S.Ct. 1913.\n\n5      The Safety Act's express pre-emption provision stated in part:\n         “Whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard established under this subchapter is in effect, no State ... shall have any authority\n         either to establish, or to continue in effect, with respect to any motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment[,] any safety\n         standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of equipment which is not identical to the Federal\n         standard.” 15 U.S.C. § 1392(d) (1988 ed.).\n         The Safety Act also included a saving clause, which stated: “Compliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued\n         under this subchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.” § 1397(k). The majority and dissent in\n         Geier agreed that the import of the express pre-emption provision and the saving clause, read together, was that by its terms, the\n         Safety Act did not expressly pre-empt state common-law actions. See Geier, 529 U.S., at 867–868, 120 S.Ct. 1913;id., at 895–\n         898, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\nIn particular, the majority found that DOT intended to “deliberately provid[e] the manufacturer[s] with a range of choices among\ndifferent passive restraint devices” and to “bring about a mix of different devices introduced gradually over time,” based on\ncomments that DOT made when promulgating its regulation, rather **1214 than the Safety Act's text. Id., at 875, 120 S.Ct.\n1913. The majority also embarked on a judicial inquiry into “why and how DOT sought these objectives,” ibid., by considering\nregulatory history and the Government's brief, which described DOT's safety standard as “ ‘embod[ying] the Secretary's policy\njudgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their fleets rather than\none particular system in every car,’ ” id., at 881, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (quoting Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Geier\nv. American Honda Motor Co., O.T.1999, No. 98–1811, p. 25); see also 529 U.S., at 883–884, 120 S.Ct. 1913. Based on this\n“ex post administrative litigating position and inferences from regulatory history and final commentary,” id., at 910–911, 120\nS.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), the Court found that the state action was pre-empted because it would have required\nmanufacturers of all cars similar to that in which the plaintiff was injured to “install airbags rather than other passive restraint\nsystems” and would have, therefore, “presented an obstacle to the variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought”\nto phase in gradually, id., at 881, 120 S.Ct. 1913.\n\nThe Court's decision in Geier to apply “purposes and objectives” pre-emption based on agency comments, regulatory *599\nhistory, and agency litigating positions was especially flawed, given that it conflicted with the plain statutory text of the saving\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In addition, the Court's reliance on its divined purpose of the federal law—to gradually phase in a mix of *600\npassive restraint systems—in order to invalidate **1215 a State's imposition of a greater safety standard was contrary to the\nmore general express statutory goal of the Safety Act “to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting\nfrom traffic accidents,” 15 U.S.C. § 1381 (1988 ed.). This Court has repeatedly stated that when statutory language is plain, it\nmust be enforced according to its terms. See Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U.S. 113, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009); see\nalso, e.g.,Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 359, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005); Lamie v.

The text in Geier “directly addressed the precise question at issue” before the\nCourt, so that should have been “the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously\nexpressed intent of Congress.” National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, ––––, 127 S.Ct. 2518,\n2534, 168 L.Ed.2d 467 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). With text that allowed state actions like the one at issue in\nGeier, the Court had no authority to comb through agency commentaries to find a basis for an alternative conclusion.\n\n6       In addition to the impropriety of looking beyond the plain text of the saving clause to regulatory history, DOT comments, and an\n        administrative litigating position to evaluate the Safety Act's pre-emptive effect, it is unclear that the Court in Geier accurately\n        assessed the federal objectives of the relevant federal law. As the dissent in Geier pointed out, the purpose of the Safety Act, as stated\n        by Congress, was generally “ ‘to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents.’ ” Id.,\n        at 888–889, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1381 (1988 ed.)). On its face, that goal is of course\n        consistent with a state-law judgment that a particular vehicle needed a passive restraint system that would better protect persons from\n        death and injury during traffic accidents. Furthermore, the dissent observed that “by definition all of the standards established under\n        the Safety Act ... impose minimum, rather than fixed or maximum, requirements.” 529 U.S., at 903, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (citing 15 U.S.C.\n        § 1391(2) (1988 ed.)). Thus, in the dissent's view, the requirements of the DOT regulation were not ceilings, and it was “obvious\n        that the Secretary favored a more rapid increase” than required by the regulations. 529 U.S., at 903, 120 S.Ct. 1913. That goal also\n        would be consistent with a state-law judgment finding that a manufacturer acted negligently when it failed to include an airbag in\n        a particular car. See id., at 903–904, 120 S.Ct. 1913.\nApplying “purposes and objectives” pre-emption in Geier, as in any case, allowed this Court to vacate a judgment issued by\nanother sovereign based on nothing more than assumptions and goals that were untethered from the constitutionally enacted\nfederal law authorizing the federal regulatory standard that was before the Court. See Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N. A., 550\nU.S. 1, 44, 127 S.Ct. 1559, 167 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (noting that pre-emption “affects the allocation\nof powers among sovereigns”). “ ‘[A]n agency literally has no power to act, let alone pre-empt the [law] of a sovereign State,\nunless and until Congress confers power upon it.’ ” New York v. FERC, 535 U.S., at 18, 122 S.Ct. 1012 (quoting Louisiana\nPub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374, 106 S.Ct. 1890, 90 L.Ed.2d 369 (1986)). Thus, no agency or individual Member\nof Congress can pre-empt a State's judgment by merely musing about goals or *601 intentions not found within or authorized\nby the statutory text. See supra, at 1206 – 1208.\n\nThe Court's “purposes and objectives” pre-emption jurisprudence is also problematic because it encourages an overly expansive\nreading of statutory text. The Court's desire to divine the broader purposes of the statute before it inevitably leads it to assume\nthat Congress wanted to pursue those policies “at all costs”—even when the text reflects a different balance. See Geier, supra,\nat 904, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (finding no evidence to support the notion that the DOT Secretary intended\nto advance the purposes of the safety standard “at all costs”); Nelson, 86 Va. L.Rev., at 279–280. As this Court has repeatedly\nnoted, “ ‘it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute's primary\nobjective must be the law.’ ” E.g.,Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U.S. 158, 171, 127 S.Ct. 799, 166 L.Ed.2d 638\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Federal\nlegislation is often the result of compromise between legislators and “groups with marked but divergent interests.” See Ragsdale\nv.

Thus, a statute's text might reflect\na compromise between parties who wanted to pursue a particular goal to different extents. See, e.g.,ibid. (noting that the Family\nand Medical Leave Act's provision of only 12 workweeks **1216 of yearly leave “was the result of compromise” that must\nbe given effect by courts); Silkwood v. Kerr–McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 257, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984) (finding\nthat a state law was not pre-empted though it allegedly frustrated a primary purpose of the Atomic Energy Act because the\nAct provided that its purpose was to be furthered only “to the extent it is consistent ‘with the health and safety of the public’\n” (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2013(d) (1982 ed.))); see also Manning, What Divides Textualists from Purposivists? 106 Colum. L.Rev.\n70, 104 (2006) (“Legislators may compromise on a statute that does not fully address a perceived mischief, accepting half a loaf\nto *602 facilitate a law's enactment”). Therefore, there is no factual basis for the assumption underlying the Court's “purposes\nand objectives” pre-emption jurisprudence that every policy seemingly consistent with federal statutory text has necessarily\nbeen authorized by Congress and warrants pre-emptive effect. Instead, our federal system in general, and the Supremacy Clause\nin particular, accords pre-emptive effect to only those policies that are actually authorized by and effectuated through the\nstatutory text.\n\n\n\n                                                                   3\n\nThe majority, while reaching the right conclusion in this case, demonstrates once again how application of “purposes and\nobjectives” pre-emption requires inquiry into matters beyond the scope of proper judicial review. For example, the majority\nrelies heavily on Congress' failure “during the ... 70–year history” of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to enact an\nexpress pre-emption provision that addresses approval of a drug label by the FDA. Ante, at 1200. That “silence on the issue,\ncoupled with [Congress'] certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation,” the majority reasons, is evidence that\nCongress did not intend for federal approval of drug labels to pre-empt state tort judgments. Ibid.; see also ante, at 1199 –\n1200 (construing from inaction that Congress “[e]vidently [had] determined that widely available state rights of action provided\nappropriate relief”). Certainly, the absence of a statutory provision pre-empting all state tort suits related to approved federal\ndrug labels is pertinent to a finding that such lawsuits are not pre-empted. But the relevance is in the fact that no statute explicitly\npre-empts the lawsuits, and not in any inferences that the Court may draw from congressional silence about the motivations or\npolicies underlying Congress' failure to act. See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 121, 115 S.Ct. 552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994)\n( “[C]ongressional silence lacks persuasive significance” (internal *603 quotation marks omitted)); O'Melveny & Myers v.\nFDIC, 512 U.S. 79, 85, 114 S.Ct. 2048, 129 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994) (“[M]atters left unaddressed in [a comprehensive and detailed\nfederal] scheme are presumably left subject to the disposition provided by state law”); Camps Newfound, 520 U.S., at 616, 117\nS.Ct. 1590 (“[O]ur pre-emption jurisprudence explicitly rejects the notion that mere congressional silence on a particular issue\nmay be read as pre-empting state law”).\n\nIn this case, the majority has concluded from silence that Congress believed state lawsuits pose no obstacle to federal drug-\napproval objectives. See ante, at 1200. That is the required conclusion, but only because it is compelled by the text of the relevant\nstatutory and regulatory provisions, not judicial suppositions about Congress' unstated goals. The fact that the Court reaches\nthe proper conclusion does not justify its speculation about the reasons for congressional inaction. In this case, the Court has\nrelied on the perceived congressional policies underlying inaction **1217 to find that state law is not pre-empted. But once the\nCourt shows a willingness to guess at the intent underlying congressional inaction, the Court could just as easily rely on its own\nperceptions regarding congressional inaction to give unduly broad pre-emptive effect to federal law. See, e.g.,American Ins.\nAssn. v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 401, 405–408, 429, 123 S.Ct. 2374, 156 L.Ed.2d 376 (2003) (finding that Congress' failure\nto pass legislation indicating that it disagreed with the President's executive agreement supported, at least in part, the Court's\ndetermination that the agreement pre-empted state law). Either approach is illegitimate. Under the Supremacy Clause, state law\nis pre-empted only by federal law “made in Pursuance” of the Constitution, Art. VI, cl. 2—not by extratextual considerations\nof the purposes underlying congressional inaction. See Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U.S. 96,\n104, 109 S.Ct. 2818, 106 L.Ed.2d 76 (1989) (plurality opinion) (finding that policy arguments that “are not based in the text of\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This, in turn, leads to decisions giving improperly\nbroad pre-emptive effect to judicially manufactured policies, rather than to the statutory text enacted by Congress pursuant to\nthe Constitution and the agency actions authorized thereby. Because such a sweeping approach to pre-emption leads to the\nillegitimate—and thus, unconstitutional—invalidation of state laws, I can no longer assent to a doctrine that pre-empts state\nlaws merely because they “stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives” of\nfederal law, Hines, 312 U.S., at 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, as perceived by this Court. I therefore respectfully concur only in the judgment.\n\n\n\nJustice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice SCALIA join, dissenting.\nThis case illustrates that tragic facts make bad law. The Court holds that a state tort jury, rather than the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), is ultimately responsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs. That result cannot be\nreconciled with Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000), or general\nprinciples of conflict pre-emption. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n                                                                    *605 I\n\nThe Court frames the question presented as a “narro[w]” one—namely, whether Wyeth has a duty to provide “an adequate\nwarning about using the IV-push method” to administer Phenergan. Ante, at 1194. But that ignores the antecedent question\nof who—the FDA or a jury in Vermont—has the authority and responsibility for determining the “adequacy” of Phenergan's\nwarnings. Moreover, it is unclear how a “stronger” warning could have helped respondent, see ante, at 1199; after **1218 all,\nthe physician's assistant who treated her disregarded at least six separate warnings that are already on Phenergan's labeling, so\nrespondent would be hard pressed to prove that a seventh would have made a difference. 1\n\n1      Indeed, respondent conceded below that Wyeth did propose an adequate warning of Phenergan's risks. See Plaintiff Diana Levine's\n       Memorandum in Opposition to Wyeth's Motion for Summary Judgment in Levine v. American Home Products Corp. (now Wyeth),\n       No. 670–12–01 Wncv (Super. Ct. Washington Cty., Vt.), ¶ 7, p. 26. Specifically, respondent noted: “In 1988, Wyeth proposed\n       language that would have prevented this accident by requiring a running IV and explaining why a running IV will address and reduce\n       the risk [of intra-arterial injection].” Ibid. See also id., at 24 (“Although not strong enough, this improved the labeling instruction, if\n       followed, would have prevented the inadvertent administration of Phenergan into an artery ...”). The FDA rejected Wyeth's proposal.\n       See App. 359.\nMore to the point, the question presented by this case is not a “narrow” one, and it does not concern whether Phenergan's label\nshould bear a “stronger” warning. Rather, the real issue is whether a state tort jury can countermand the FDA's considered\njudgment that Phenergan's FDA-mandated warning label renders its intravenous (IV) use “safe.” Indeed, respondent's amended\ncomplaint alleged that Phenergan is “not reasonably safe for intravenous administration,” App. 15, ¶ 6; respondent's attorney\ntold the jury that Phenergan's label should say, “ ‘Do not use this drug intravenously,’ ” id., at 32; respondent's expert told the\n *606 jury, “I think the drug should be labeled ‘Not for IV use,’ ” id., at 59; and during his closing argument, respondent's\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

You will make the decision. ...\nThe FDA doesn't make the decision, you do,” id., at 211–212. 2\n\n2      Moreover, in the trial judge's final charge, he told the jury that “the critical factual issue which you must decide” is whether Phenergan's\n       FDA-mandated label reflects a proper balance between “the risks and benefits of intravenous administration and the potential for\n       injury to patients.” Id., at 220. See also 183 Vt. 76, ––––, 944 A.2d 179, 182 (2006) (recognizing that respondent's argument is that\n       Phenergan's “label should not have allowed IV push as a means of administration”).\nFederal law, however, does rely on the FDA to make safety determinations like the one it made here. The FDA has long\nknown about the risks associated with IV push in general and its use to administer Phenergan in particular. Whether wisely\nor not, the FDA has concluded—over the course of extensive, 54–year–long regulatory proceedings—that the drug is “safe”\nand “effective” when used in accordance with its FDA-mandated labeling. The unfortunate fact that respondent's healthcare\nproviders ignored Phenergan's labeling may make this an ideal medical-malpractice case. 3 But turning a common-law tort suit\ninto a “frontal assault” on the FDA's regulatory regime for drug labeling upsets the well-settled meaning of the Supremacy\nClause and our conflict pre-emption jurisprudence.

Medtronic,\nInc., 552 U.S. 312, ––––, 128 S.Ct. 999, 1018, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting), and we held that the latter\npre-empted a state-law tort suit that conflicted with the FDA's determination that a medical device was “safe,” id., at ––––,\n128 S.Ct., at 1018 (opinion of the Court).\n\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a drug manufacturer may not market a new drug before first\nsubmitting a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA and receiving the agency's approval. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). An NDA\nmust contain, among other things, “the labeling proposed to be used for such drug,” § 355(b)(1)(F), “full reports of investigations\nwhich have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,” § 355(b)\n(1)(A), and “a discussion of why the benefits exceed the risks [of the drug] under the conditions stated in the labeling,” 21 CFR §\n314.50(d)(5)(viii) (2008). The FDA will approve an NDA only if the agency finds, among other things, that the drug is “safe for\nuse under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,” there is “substantial evidence\nthat the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended,\nor suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,” and the proposed labeling is not “false or misleading in any particular.” 21\nU.S.C. § 355(d).\n\n *608 After the FDA approves a drug, the manufacturer remains under an obligation to investigate and report any adverse\nevents associated with the drug, see 21 CFR § 314.80, and must periodically submit any new information that may affect the\nFDA's previous conclusions about the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug, 21 U.S.C. § 355(k).

Labeling is “[t]he centerpiece of risk management,” as it “communicates to health care practitioners the\nagency's formal, authoritative conclusions regarding the conditions under which the product can be used safely and effectively.”\n71 Fed.Reg. 3934 (2006). The FDA has underscored the importance it places on drug labels by promulgating comprehensive\nregulations—spanning an entire part of the Code of Federal Regulations, see 21 CFR pt. 201, with seven subparts and 70\nseparate sections—that set forth drug manufacturers' labeling obligations. Under those regulations, the FDA must be satisfied\nthat a drug's warning label contains, among other things, “a summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe\nand effective use of the drug,” § 201.56(1), including a **1220 description of “clinically significant adverse reactions,” “other\npotential safety hazards,” “limitations in use imposed by them, ... and steps that should be taken if they occur,” § 201.57(c)(6)\n(i). Neither the FDCA nor its implementing regulations suggest that juries may second-guess the FDA's labeling decisions.\n\n\n\n                                                             *609 B\n\n\n                                                                1\n\nWhere the FDA determines, in accordance with its statutory mandate, that a drug is on balance “safe,” our conflict pre-\nemption cases prohibit any State from countermanding that determination. See, e.g.,Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm.,\n531 U.S. 341, 348, 121 S.Ct. 1012, 148 L.Ed.2d 854 (2001) (after the FDA has struck “a somewhat delicate balance of statutory\nobjectives” and determined that petitioner submitted a valid application to manufacture a medical device, a State may not use\ncommon law to negate it); International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 494, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987)\n(after the EPA has struck “the balance of public and private interests so carefully addressed by” the federal permitting regime\nfor water pollution, a State may not use nuisance law to “upse[t]” it); Chicago & North Western Transp.

Rather, the ordinary principles of conflict pre-emption turn solely on whether a State has upset the regulatory\nbalance struck by the federal agency. Id., at 884–885, 120 S.Ct. 1913; see also Chicago & North Western Transp. Co., supra, at\n317, 101 S.Ct. 1124 (describing conflict pre-emption as “a two-step process of first ascertaining the construction of the [federal\nand state laws] and then determining the constitutional question *610 whether they are actually in conflict” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                                                2\n\nA faithful application of this Court's conflict pre-emption cases compels the conclusion that the FDA's 40–year–long effort\nto regulate the safety and efficacy of Phenergan pre-empts respondent's tort suit.

Acting\npursuant to that statutory mandate, the Secretary of Transportation promulgated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208,\nwhich required car manufacturers to include passive restraint systems (i.e., devices that work automatically to protect occupants\nfrom injury during a collision) in a certain percentage of their cars built in or after 1987. See 49 CFR § 571.208 (1999). Standard\n208 did not require installation of any particular type of passive restraint; instead, it gave manufacturers the option to install\nautomatic **1221 seatbelts, airbags, or any other suitable technology that they might develop, provided the restraint(s) met\nthe performance requirements specified in the rule. Ibid.\n\nAlexis Geier drove her 1987 Honda Accord into a tree, and although she was wearing her seatbelt, she nonetheless suffered\nserious injuries. She then sued Honda under state tort law, alleging that her car was negligently and defectively designed because\nit lacked a driver's-side airbag. She argued that Congress had empowered the Secretary to set only “minimum standard[s]”\nfor vehicle safety. 15 U.S.C. § 1391(2). She also emphasized that the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act contains\na saving clause, which *611 provides that “[c]ompliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this\nsubchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.” § 1397(k).\n\nNotwithstanding the statute's saving clause, and notwithstanding the fact that Congress gave the Secretary authority to set only\n“minimum” safety standards, we held Geier's state tort suit pre-empted. In reaching that result, we relied heavily on the view of\nthe Secretary of Transportation—expressed in an amicus brief—that Standard 208 “ ‘embodies the Secretary's policy judgment\nthat safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their fleets rather than one\nparticular system in every car.’ ” 529 U.S., at 881, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (quoting Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, O.T.1999,\nNo. 98–1811, p. 25). Because the Secretary determined that a menu of alternative technologies was “safe,” the doctrine of\nconflict pre-emption barred Geier's efforts to deem some of those federally approved alternatives “unsafe” under state tort law.\n\nThe same rationale applies here. Through Phenergan's label, the FDA offered medical professionals a menu of federally\napproved, “safe” and “effective” alternatives—including IV push—for administering the drug. Through a state tort suit,\nrespondent attempted to deem IV push “unsafe” and “ineffective.” To be sure, federal law does not prohibit Wyeth from\ncontraindicating IV push, just as federal law did not prohibit Honda from installing airbags in all its cars. But just as we held that\nStates may not compel the latter, so, too, are States precluded from compelling the former. See also Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan\nAssn. v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 155, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982) (“The conflict does not evaporate because\nthe [agency's] regulation simply permits, but does not compel,” the action forbidden by state law). If anything, a finding of\npre-emption is even more appropriate here because the FDCA—unlike the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act—\ncontains no evidence that Congress intended *612 the FDA to set only “minimum standards,” and the FDCA does not contain\na saving clause. 4 SEE ALSO **1222 ante, at 1200 (conceding congress' “ silence” on the issue).\n\n4      To be sure, Congress recognized the principles of conflict pre-emption in the FDCA. See Drug Amendments of 1962, § 202, 76 Stat.\n       793 (“Nothing in the amendments made by this Act to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shall be construed as invalidating\n       any provision of State law ... unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of State\n       law”). But a provision that simply recognizes the background principles of conflict pre-emption is not a traditional “saving clause,”\n       and even if it were, it would not displace our conflict-pre-emption analysis. See Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861,\n       869, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000) (“[T]he saving clause ... does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption\n       principles”); id., at 873–874, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (“The Court has ... refused to read general ‘saving’ provisions to tolerate actual conflict\n       both in cases involving impossibility and in ‘frustration-of-purpose’ cases” (emphasis deleted and citation omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                                                     III\n\nIn its attempt to evade Geier 's applicability to this case, the Court commits both factual and legal errors.

Second, as a legal matter, Geier does not stand for the legal propositions espoused by the dissenters\n(and specifically rejected by the majority) in that case. Third, drug labeling by jury verdict undermines both our broader pre-\nemption jurisprudence and the broader workability of the federal drug-labeling regime.\n\n\n\n                                                                 A\n\nPhenergan's warning label has been subject to the FDA's strict regulatory oversight since the 1950's. For at least the last 34 years,\nthe FDA has focused specifically on whether IV-push administration of Phenergan is “safe” and “effective” when performed\nin accordance with Phenergan's label. The agency's ultimate decision—to retain IV push as one *613 means for administering\nPhenergan, albeit subject to stringent warnings—is reflected in the plain text of Phenergan's label (sometimes in boldfaced\nfont and all-capital letters). And the record contains ample evidence that the FDA specifically considered and reconsidered the\nstrength of Phenergan's IV-push-related warnings in light of new scientific and medical data. The majority's factual assertions\nto the contrary are mistaken.\n\n\n\n                                                                 1\n\nThe FDA's focus on IV push as a means of administering Phenergan dates back at least to 1975. In August of that year, several\nrepresentatives from both the FDA and Wyeth met to discuss Phenergan's warning label. At that meeting, the FDA specifically\nproposed “that Phenergan Injection should not be used in Tubex & reg;.” 2 Record 583, 586 (Plaintiff's Trial Exh. 17, Internal\nCorrespondence from W.E. Langeland to File (Sept. 5, 1975) (hereinafter 1975 Memo)). “Tubex” is a syringe system used\nexclusively for IV push. See App. 43. An FDA official explained that the agency's concerns arose from medical-malpractice\nlawsuits involving IV push of the drug, see 1975 Memo 586, and that the FDA was aware of “5 cases involving amputation\nwhere the drug had been administered by Tubex together with several additional cases involving necrosis,” id., at 586–587.\nRather than contraindicating Phenergan for IV push, however, the agency and Wyeth agreed “that there was a need for better\ninstruction regarding the problems of intraarterial injection.” Id., at 587.\n\nThe next year, the FDA convened an advisory committee to study, among other things, the risks associated with the Tubex\nsystem and IV push. App. 294. At the conclusion of its study, the committee recommended an additional IV-push-specific\nwarning for Phenergan's label, see ibid., but did not recommend eliminating IV push from the drug label altogether. In response\nto the committee's recommendations, the FDA instructed Wyeth to make several changes to *614 strengthen Phenergan's\nlabel, including the addition of upper case warnings related to IV push. See id., at 279–280, 282–283.\n\n**1223 In 1987, the FDA directed Wyeth to amend its label to include the following text:\n\n  “ ‘[1] When used intravenously, [Phenergan] should be given in a concentration no greater than 25 mg/ml and at a rate not to\n  exceed 25 mg/minute. [2] Injection through a properly running intravenous infusion may enhance the possibility of detecting\n  arterial placement.’ ” Id., at 311–312.\n\nThe first of the two quoted sentences refers specifically to IV push; as respondent's medical expert testified at trial, the label's\nrecommended rate of administration (not to exceed 25 mg per minute) refers to “IV push, as opposed to say being in a bag\nand dripped over a couple of hours.” Id., at 52. The second of the two quoted sentences refers to IV drip. See id., at 15–16\n(emphasizing that a “running IV” is the same thing as “IV drip”).\n\nIn its 1987 labeling order, the FDA cited voluminous materials to “suppor[t]” its new and stronger warnings related to IV\npush and the preferability of IV drip. 5 Id., at 313. One of those articles specifically discussed the relative advantages and\ndisadvantages of IV drip compared to IV push, as *615 well as the costs and benefits of administering Phenergan via IV push. 6\nThe FDA also cited published case reports from the 1960's of gangrene caused by the intra-arterial injection of Phenergan, 7 and\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(CCH) P 18,176...\n\nthe FDA instructed Wyeth to amend Phenergan's label in accordance with the latest medical research. 8 The FDA also studied\ndrugs similar to Phenergan and cited numerous cautionary articles—one of which urged the agency to consider contraindicating\n**1224 such drugs for IV use altogether. 9\n\n5        The FDA cited numerous articles that generally discuss the costs and benefits associated with IV push. See, e.g., Nahrwold & Phelps,\n         Inadvertent Intra–Arterial Injection of Mephenteramine, 70 Rocky Mountain Medical J. 38 (Sept.1973) (cited in App. 314, no. 14);\n         Albo, Cheung, Ruth, Snyder, & Reemtsma, Effect of Intra–Arterial Injections of Barbituates, 120 Am.

See also Mostafavi & Samimi, Accidental Intra-arterial Injection of\n         Promethazine HCl During General Anesthesia, 35 Anesthesiology 645 (1971) (reporting a case of gangrene, which required partial\n         amputation of three fingers, after Phenergan was inadvertently pushed into an artery in the “antecubital” area); Promethazine, p. 7,\n         in Clinical Pharmacology (Gold Standard Multimedia Inc. CD–ROM, version 1.16 (1998) (noting that “[i]nadvertent intra-arterial\n         injection [of Phenergan] can result in arteriospasm ... and development of gangrene”)).\n8        Hager and Wilson noted that the most common reactions to intra-arterial injections of drugs like Phenergan include “[i]mmediate,\n         severe, burning pain,” as well as “blanching.” 94 Archives of Surgery, at 87–88. The FDA required Wyeth to include Hager and\n         Wilson's observations on Phenergan's label. See App. 311 (requiring the label to warn that “ ‘[t]he first sign [of an intra-arterial\n         injection] may be the patient's reaction to a sensation of fiery burning’ ” pain and “ ‘[b]lanching’ ”).\n9        See Enloe 427 (discussing hydroxyzine—an antihistamine with chemical properties similar to those of Phenergan—and suggesting\n         its “temporary” benefits can never outweigh the risks of intra-arterial injection); see also Goldsmith & Trieger, Accidental Intra–\n         Arterial Injection: A Medical Emergency, 22 Anesthesia Progress 180 (1975) (noting the risks of intra-arterial administration of\n         hydroxyzine) (cited in App. 315, no. 18); Klatte, Brooks, & Rhamy, Toxicity of Intra–Arterial Barbituates and Tranquilizing Drugs,\n         92 Radiology 700 (1969) (same) (cited in App. 314, no. 13). With full knowledge of those risks, FDA retained IV push for Phenergan,\n         although the agency required Wyeth to incorporate observations from the Enloe article into Phenergan's label. Compare Enloe 427\n         (arguing that “every precaution should be taken to avoid inadvertent intra-arterial injection,” including the use of “an obviously well-\n         functioning venoclysis”), with App. 312 (FDA's 1987 changes to Phenergan's label). In contrast, at some time around 1970, the\n         FDA prohibited all intravenous use of hydroxyzine. See id., at 79 (testimony of Dr. Harold Green). The FDA's decision to regulate\n         the two drugs differently—notwithstanding (1) the agency's knowledge of the risks associated with both drugs and (2) the agency's\n         recognition of the relevance of hydroxyzine-related articles and case reports in its regulation of Phenergan—further demonstrates\n         that the FDA intentionally preserved IV-push administration for Phenergan. See also Haas, Correspondence, 33 Anesthesia Progress\n         281 (1986) (“[Hydroxyzine's] restriction does not lie with the medicine itself, but in the practice and malpractice of intravenous\n         techniques. Unfortunately, the practitioner who knows how to treat injection technique problems is usually not the practitioner with\n         the intravenous technique problems”).\n *616 In “support” of its labeling order, the FDA also cited numerous articles that singled out the inner crook of the elbow\n—known as the “antecubital fossa” in the medical community—which is both a commonly used injection site, see id., at 70\n(noting that respondent's injection was pushed into “the antecubital space”), and a universally recognized high-risk area for\ninadvertent intra-arterial injections. One of the articles explained:\n\n    “Because of the numerous superficial positions the ulnar artery might occupy, it has often been entered during attempted\n    venipuncture [of the antecubital fossa]. ...

For example, the label warned of the risks of intra-arterial injection\nassociated with “aspiration,” which is a technique used only in conjunction with IV push. 12 The *618 label also cautioned\nagainst the use of “syringes with rigid plungers,” App. 390, which are used only to administer the drug via IV push. As\nrespondent's medical expert testified at trial, “by talking plungers and rigid needles, that's the way you do it, to push it with the\nplunger.” Id., at 53 (testimony of Dr. John Matthew). Moreover, Phenergan's 2000 label devoted almost a full page to discussing\nthe “Tubex system,” see id., at 391, which, as noted above, is used only to administer the drug via IV push.\n\n12     “Aspiration” refers to drawing a small amount of blood back into the needle to determine whether the needle is in an artery or a vein.\n       Ordinarily, arterial blood is brighter than venous blood—but contact with Phenergan causes discoloration, which makes aspiration an\n       unreliable method of protecting against intra-arterial injection. See id., at 282. Therefore, the label warned that when using IV push, a\n       medical professional should beware that “[a]spiration of dark blood does not preclude intra-arterial needle placement, because blood\n       is discolored upon contact with Phenergan Injection.” Id., at 390.\nWhile Phenergan's label very clearly authorized the use of IV push, it also made clear that IV push is the delivery method\nof last resort. The label specified that “[t]he preferred parenteral route of administration is by deep intramuscular injection.”\nId., at 390. If an intramuscular injection is ineffective, then “it is usually preferable to inject [Phenergan] through the tubing\nof an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily.” Ibid. See also id., at 50–51 (testimony of\nrespondent's medical expert, Dr. John Matthew) (conceding that the best way to determine that an IV set is functioning\nsatisfactorily is to use IV drip). Finally, if for whatever reason a medical professional chooses to use IV push, he or she is on\nnotice that “INADVERTENT INTRA–ARTERIAL INJECTION CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED\nEXTREMITY.” Id., at 391; see also id., at 390 (“Under no circumstances should Phenergan Injection be given by intra-arterial\ninjection due to the likelihood of severe arteriospasm and the possibility of resultant gangrene”).\n\nPhenergan's label also directs medical practitioners to choose veins wisely when using IV push:\n\n  “Due to the close proximity of arteries and veins in the areas most commonly used for intravenous injection, extreme *619\n  care should be exercised to avoid perivascular extravasation or inadvertent intra-arterial injection.

And whatever else might be said about the extensive medical authorities and\ncase reports that the FDA cited in “support” of its approval of IV-push administration of Phenergan, it cannot be said that the\nFDA “paid no more than passing attention to” IV push, ante, at 1193; nor can it be said that the FDA failed to weigh its costs\nand benefits, Brief for Respondent 50.\n\n\n\n                                                                        3\n\nFor her part, respondent does not dispute the FDA's conclusion that IV push has certain benefits. At trial, her medical\npractitioners testified that they used IV push in order to help her “in a swift and timely way” when she showed up at the\nhospital for the second time in one day complaining of “intractable” migraines, “terrible pain,” inability to “bear light or sound,”\nsleeplessness, hours-long spasms of “retching” and “vomiting,” and when “every possible” alternative treatment had “failed.”\nApp. 40 (testimony of Dr. John Matthew); id., at 103, 106, 109 (testimony of physician's assistant Jessica Fisch).\n\nRather than disputing the benefits of IV push, respondent complains that the FDA and Wyeth underestimated its costs (and\nhence did not provide sufficient warnings regarding its risks). But when the FDA mandated that Phenergan's label read,\n“INADVERTENT INTRA–ARTERIAL INJECTION *620 CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED\nEXTREMITY,” id., at 391, and when the FDA required Wyeth to warn that “[u]nder no circumstances should Phenergan\nInjection be given by intra-arterial injection,” id., at 390, the agency could reasonably assume that medical professionals would\ntake care not to inject Phenergan intra-arterially. See also 71 Fed.Reg. 3934 (noting that a drug's warning label “communicates\nto health care practitioners the agency's formal, authoritative conclusions regarding the conditions under which the product\ncan be used safely and effectively”). Unfortunately, the physician's assistant who treated respondent in this case disregarded\nPhenergan's label and pushed the drug into the single spot on her arm that is most likely to cause an inadvertent intra-arterial\ninjection.\n\nAs noted above, when the FDA approved Phenergan's label, it was textbook medical knowledge that the “antecubital fossa”\ncreates a high risk of inadvertent intra-arterial injection, given the close proximity of veins and arteries. See supra, at 1224 –\n1225; see also The Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice 99 (7th ed.2001) (noting, in a red-text “NURSING ALERT,” that\nthe antecubital fossa is “not recommended” for administering dangerous drugs, “due to the potential for extravasation”). 13\nAccording to the physician's assistant who injured respondent, however, “[i]t never crossed my mind” that an antecubital\ninjection of Phenergan could hit an artery. App. 110; see also ibid. (“[It] just wasn't something that I was aware of at the\ntime”). Oblivious to the risks emphasized in Phenergan's warnings, the physician's assistant pushed a double dose of the drug\ninto an antecubital artery over the course of “[p]robably about three to four minutes,” id., at 111; id., at 105, notwithstanding\nrespondent's *621 complaints of a “ ‘burn [ing]’ ” sensation that she subsequently described as “ ‘one of the most extreme\npains that I've ever felt,’ ” **1227 id., at 110, 180–181. And when asked why she ignored Phenergan's label and failed to stop\npushing the drug after respondent complained of burning pains, the physician's assistant explained that it would have been “just\ncrazy” to “worr[y] about an [intra-arterial] injection” under the circumstances, id., at 111.\n\n13     In addition, respondent's own medical expert testified at trial that it is a principle of “basic anatomy” that the antecubital fossa contains\n       aberrant arteries. See 2 Tr. 34–35 (Mar. 9, 2004) (testimony of Dr. Daniel O'Brien); see also ibid. (noting that Gray's Anatomy, which\n       is “the Bible of anatomy,” also warns of arteries in the antecubital space).\nThe FDA, however, did not think that the risks associated with IV push—especially in the antecubital space—were “just crazy.”\nThat is why Phenergan's label so clearly warns against them.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The contrary conclusion requires turning yesterday's\ndissent into today's majority opinion.\n\nFirst, the Court denies the existence of a federal-state conflict in this case because Vermont merely countermanded the FDA's\ndetermination that IV push is “safe” when performed in accordance with Phenergan's warning label; the Court concludes\nthat there is no conflict because Vermont did not “mandate a particular” label as a “replacement” for the one that the jury\nnullified, and because the State stopped short of altogether “contraindicating IV-push administration.” Ante, at 1194. But as we\nemphasized in Geier (over the dissent's assertions to the contrary), the degree of a State's intrusion upon federal law is irrelevant\n—the Supremacy Clause applies with equal force to a state tort law that merely countermands a federal safety determination\nand to a state law that altogether prohibits car manufacturers from selling cars without airbags. Compare 529 U.S., at 881–\n882, 120 S.Ct. 1913, with id., at 902, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Indeed, as recently as last Term, we held that\nthe Supremacy Clause pre-empts *622 a “[s]tate tort law that requires a manufacturer's catheters to be safer, but hence less\neffective, than the model the FDA has approved ....” Riegel, 552 U.S., at ––––, 128 S.Ct., at 1008. It did not matter there that the\nState stopped short of altogether prohibiting the use of FDA-approved catheters—just as it does not matter here that Vermont\nstopped short of altogether prohibiting an FDA-approved method for administering Phenergan. See also Lohr, 518 U.S., at 504,\n116 S.Ct. 2240 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting it would be an “anomalous result” if pre-\nemption applied differently to a state tort suit premised on the inadequacy of the FDA's safety regulations and a state law that\nspecifically prohibited an FDA-approved design).\n\nSecond, the Court today distinguishes Geier because the FDA articulated its pre-emptive intent “without offering States or other\ninterested parties notice or opportunity for comment.” Ante, at 1201; see also ante, at 1203. But the Geier Court specifically\nrejected the argument (again made by the dissenters in that case) that conflict pre-emption is appropriate only where the agency\nexpresses its pre-emptive intent through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Compare 529 U.S., at 885, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (“To insist\non a specific expression of agency intent to pre-empt, made after notice-and-comment rulemaking, would be in certain cases\nto tolerate conflicts that an agency, and therefore Congress, is most unlikely to have intended. The dissent, as we have said,\napparently welcomes that result .... We do not”), with id., at 908–910, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (emphasizing\nthat “we generally expect an administrative regulation to declare any intention to **1228 pre-empt state law with some\nspecificity,” and that “[t]his expectation ... serves to ensure that States will be able to have a dialog with agencies regarding pre-\nemption decisions ex ante through the normal notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, pre-emption is arguably more appropriate here than in Geier because the FDA (unlike the\nDOT) declared its pre-emptive intent in the Federal Register *623 . See 71 Fed.Reg. 3933–3936. Yet the majority dismisses\nthe FDA's published preamble as “inherently suspect,” ante, at 1201, and an afterthought that is entitled to “no weight,” ante,\nat 1204. Compare Lohr, supra, at 506, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of BREYER, J.) (emphasizing that the FDA has a “special\nunderstanding of the likely impact of both state and federal requirements, as well as an understanding of whether (or the extent\nto which) state requirements may interfere with federal objectives,” and that “[t]he FDA can translate these understandings into\nparticularized pre-emptive intentions ... through statements in ‘regulations, preambles, interpretive statements, and responses\nto comments' ”).\n\nThird, the Court distinguishes Geier because the DOT's regulation “bear[s] the force of law,” whereas the FDA's preamble\ndoes not. Ante, at 1203; see also ante, at 1200. But it is irrelevant that the FDA's preamble does not “bear the force of law”\nbecause the FDA's labeling decisions surely do. See 21 U.S.C. § 355. It is well within the FDA's discretion to make its labeling\ndecisions through administrative adjudications rather than through less-formal and less-flexible rulemaking proceedings, see\nSEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947), and we have never previously held that our pre-\nemption analysis turns on the agency's choice of the latter over the former. Moreover, it cannot be said that Geier 's outcome\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(CCH) P 18,176...\n\nhinged on the agency's choice to promulgate a rule. See ante, at 1200, 1203. The Geier Court relied—again over the dissenters'\nprotestations—on materials other than the Secretary's regulation to explain the conflict between state and federal law. Compare\n529 U.S., at 881, 120 S.Ct. 1913, with id., at 899–900, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and ante, at 1204 (BREYER,\nJ., concurring).\n\nFourth, the Court sandwiches its discussion of Geier between the “presumption against pre-emption,” ante, at 1200, and heavy\nemphasis on “the longstanding coexistence of state and federal law and the FDA's traditional recognition of state-law remedies,”\nante, at 1203. But the Geier Court specifically rejected the argument (again made by the dissenters *624 in that case) that the\n“presumption against pre-emption” is relevant to the conflict pre-emption analysis. See 529 U.S., at 906–907, 120 S.Ct. 1913\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Court simply ignores the presumption [against pre-emption]”). Rather than invoking such\na “presumption,” the Court emphasized that it was applying “ordinary,” “longstanding,” and “experience-proved principles\nof conflict pre-emption.” Id., at 874, 120 S.Ct. 1913. Under these principles, the sole question is whether there is an “actual\nconflict” between state and federal law; if so, then pre-emption follows automatically by operation of the Supremacy Clause.\nId., at 871–872, 120 S.Ct. 1913. See also Buckman, 531 U.S., at 347–348, 121 S.Ct. 1012 (“ [P]etitioner's dealings with the FDA\nwere prompted by [federal law], and the very subject matter of petitioner's statements [to the FDA] were dictated by [federal\nlaw]. Accordingly—and in contrast to situations implicating ‘federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation\nof matters of health and safety’—no presumption **1229 against pre-emption obtains in this case” (citation omitted)). 14\n\n14     Thus, it is not true that “this Court has long” applied a presumption against pre-emption in conflict pre-emption cases. Ante, at\n       1195, n. 3 (majority opinion). As long ago as Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824), the Court inquired whether\n       a state law “interfer[ed] with,” was “contrary to,” or “c[a]me into collision with” federal law—and it did so without ever invoking\n       a “presumption.” See also Davis, Unmasking the Presumption in Favor of Preemption, 53 S.C.L.Rev. 967, 974 (2002) (noting that\n       many of the Court's early pre-emption cases “resulted in almost automatic preemption of concurrent state regulation”). In subsequent\n       years the Court has sometimes acknowledged a limited “presumption against pre-emption,” but it nonetheless remained an open\n       question—before today—whether that presumption applied in conflict pre-emption cases. See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade\n       Council, 530 U.S. 363, 374, n. 8, 120 S.Ct. 2288, 147 L.Ed.2d 352 (2000) (“We leave for another day a consideration in this context\n       of a presumption against preemption”). Moreover, this Court has never held that the “presumption” applies in an area—such as drug\n       labeling—that has long been “reserved for federal regulation.” United States v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89, 111, 120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d\n       69 (2000). See also Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm., 531 U.S. 341, 347–348, 121 S.Ct. 1012, 148 L.Ed.2d 854 (2001).\n *625 Finally, the Geier Court went out of its way to emphasize (yet again over the dissenters' objections) that it placed “some\nweight” on the DOT's amicus brief, which explained the agency's regulatory objectives and the effects of state tort suits on the\nfederal regulatory regime. 529 U.S., at 883, 120 S.Ct. 1913; compare id., at 910–911, 120 S.Ct. 1913 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)\n(criticizing the majority for “uph[olding] a regulatory claim of frustration-of-purposes implied conflict pre-emption based on\nnothing more than an ex post administrative litigating position and inferences from regulatory history and final commentary”).\nSee also Lohr, 518 U.S., at 496, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (recognizing that the FDA is “uniquely qualified” to explain whether state law\nconflicts with the FDA's objectives). Yet today, the FDA's explanation of the conflict between state tort suits and the federal\nlabeling regime, set forth in the agency's amicus brief, is not even mentioned in the Court's opinion. Instead of relying on the\nFDA's explanation of its own regulatory purposes, the Court relies on a decade-old and now-repudiated statement, which the\nmajority finds preferable. See ante, at 1201 – 1202, 1203, n. 13. Cf. Riegel, 552 U.S., at ––––, 128 S.Ct., at 1010 (noting that “the\nagency's earlier position (which the dissent describes at some length and finds preferable) is ... compromised, indeed deprived\nof all claim to deference, by the fact that it is no longer the agency's position” (citation omitted)); Altria Group, Inc. v. Good,\n555 U.S. 70, ––––, 129 S.Ct. 538, 549–550, 172L.Ed.2d 398 (2008) (rejecting petitioners' reliance on the pre-emptive effect\nof the agency's “longstanding policy” because it is inconsistent with the agency's current one). And Justice BREYER suggests\nthat state tort suits may “help the [FDA],” ante, at 1204 (concurring opinion), notwithstanding the FDA's insistence that state\ntort suits will “disrupt the agency's balancing of health risks and benefits,” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9.\n\nGeier does not countenance the use of state tort suits to second-guess the FDA's labeling decisions. And the Court's contrary\nconclusion has potentially far-reaching consequences.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

As we explained in Riegel,\njuries tend to focus on the risk of a **1230 particular product's design or warning label that arguably contributed to a particular\nplaintiff's injury, not on the overall benefits of that design or label; “the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented\nin court.” 552 U.S., at 325, 128 S.Ct., at 1008. Indeed, patients like respondent are the only ones whom tort juries ever see,\nand for a patient like respondent—who has already suffered a tragic accident—Phenergan's risks are no longer a matter of\nprobabilities and potentialities.\n\nIn contrast, the FDA has the benefit of the long view. Its drug-approval determinations consider the interests of all potential\nusers of a drug, including “those who would suffer without new medical [products]” if juries in all 50 States were free to\ncontradict the FDA's expert determinations. Id., at ––––, 128 S.Ct., at 1009. And the FDA conveys its warnings with one voice,\nrather than whipsawing the medical community with 50 (or more) potentially conflicting ones. After today's ruling, however,\nparochialism may prevail.\n\nThe problem is well illustrated by the labels borne by “vesicant” drugs, many of which are used for chemotherapy. As a class,\nvesicants are much more dangerous than drugs like Phenergan, 15 but the vast majority of vesicant labels—like Phenergan's—\neither allow or do not disallow IV push. See Appendix, infra. Because vesicant extravasation can have devastating consequences,\nand because the potentially lifesaving benefits of these drugs offer hollow solace to the victim *627 of such a tragedy, a jury's\ncost-benefit analysis in a particular case may well differ from the FDA's.\n\n15     Vesicants may cause “blistering, severe tissue injury, or tissue necrosis” upon extravasation—even if the drug is not injected into an\n       artery. See, e.g., Schulmeister, Administering Vesicants, 9 Clinical J. of Oncology Nursing 469, 469–470 (2005). See also ante, at\n       1192 (majority opinion) (noting that Phenergan is labeled as an “irritant”); cf. Brief for Anju Budhwani et al. as Amici Curiae 15\n       (suggesting Phenergan should be considered a “vesicant”).\nFor example, consider Mustargen (mechlorethamine HCl)—the injectable form of mustard gas—which can be used as an\nanticancer drug. Mustargen's FDA-approved label warns in several places that “This drug is HIGHLY TOXIC.” 16 Indeed,\nthe drug is so highly toxic:\n\n16     FDA, Oncology Tools Product Label Details, online at http:// www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/onctools/labels.cfm?\n       GN=meclorethamine,% 20nitrogen% 20mustard (as visited Mar. 2, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).\n\n\n  “Should accidental eye contact occur, copious irrigation for at least 15 minutes with water, normal saline or a balanced salt\n  ophthalmic irrigating solution should be instituted immediately, followed by prompt ophthalmologic consultation. Should\n  accidental skin contact occur, the affected part must be irrigated immediately with copious amounts of water, for at least 15\n  minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes, followed by 2% sodium thiosulfate solution. Medical attention\n  should be sought immediately. Contaminated clothing should be destroyed.” 17\n17     Ibid.\nYet when it comes to administering this highly toxic drug, the label provides that “the drug may be injected directly into any\nsuitable vein, [but] it is injected preferably into the rubber or plastic tubing of a flowing intravenous infusion set. This reduces\nthe possibility of severe local reactions due to extravasation or high concentration of the drug.” (Emphasis added.) Similarly,\nthe FDA-approved labels for other powerful chemotherapeutic vesicants **1231 —including Dactinomycin, Oxaliplatin,\nVinblastine, and Vincristine—specifically allow IV push, notwithstanding their devastating effects when extravasated.\n\n *628 The fact that the labels for such drugs allow IV push is striking—both because vesicants are much more dangerous than\nPhenergan, and also because they are so frequently extravasated, see Boyle & Engelking, Vesicant Extravasation: Myths and\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Regardless of the FDA's reasons for not contraindicating IV push for these drugs, it is odd (to\nsay the least) that a jury in Vermont can now order for Phenergan what the FDA has chosen not to order for mustard gas. 18\n\n18     The same is true of FDA's regulation of hydroxyzine. See n. 9, supra.\n\n\n\n                                                                 ***\n\nTo be sure, state tort suits can peacefully coexist with the FDA's labeling regime, and they have done so for decades. Ante, at\n1199 – 1200. But this case is far from peaceful coexistence. The FDA told Wyeth that Phenergan's label renders its use “safe.”\nBut the State of Vermont, through its tort law, said: “Not so.”\n\nThe state-law rule at issue here is squarely pre-empted. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nVermont.\n\n\n                                        *629 APPENDIX TO OPINION OF ALITO, J.\n\n       Vesicant 1                                  IV Push 2\n\n       Dactinomycin                                Specifically allowed\n\n       Mechlorethamine\n\n       (Mustargen)                                 Specifically allowed\n\n       Oxaliplatin                                 Specifically allowed\n\n       Vinblastine                                 Specifically allowed\n\n       Vincristine                                 Specifically allowed\n\n       Bleomycin                                   Neither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n       Carboplatin                                 Neither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n       Dacarbazine                                 Neither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n       Mitomycin                                   Neither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n       Carmustine                                  Not prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n       Cisplatin                                   Not prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n       Epirubicin                                  Not prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n       Etoposide                                   Not prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n       Ifosfamide                                  Not prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n       Mitoxantrone                                Not prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Master\n        agreed not to take or disclose any confidential information to\n        which she had access during her employment, but she did so\n        anyway, and received $12 million as a result. Was Master’s\n        conduct protected under the federal statute? ................................... xiii \n        Second Issue: The trial court erred granting summary\n        judgment on causation based on an incompetent affidavit not\n        made on personal knowledge that only addressed one category\n        of damages, and because the allegation in the affidavit—that\n        LHC terminated its contract with MJS due to MJS’s poor\n        performance—is contradicted by evidence that LHC did so\n        because Master used its privileged and confidential information\n        to initiate a qui tam action, thus raising a genuine issue of\n        material fact. ...................................................................................... xiii \n        Third Issue:

Master had used documents\n                               surreptitiously taken from MJS against\n                               MJS’s client in a federal qui tam action.\nCourse of Proceedings          After MJS filed this suit, Master removed\n                               it to federal district court in the Eastern\n                               District of Texas and joined MJS as a\n                               defendant in the pending qui tam action in\n                               the Western District of Louisiana. The\n                               federal court in Texas remanded this case\n                               based on the lack of any federal question. 1\n                               CR 128-37. The state trial court then\n                               stayed the case in favor of the pending qui\n                               tam action. 2 CR 197. The federal court in\n                               Louisiana dismissed Master’s claims\n                               against MJS with prejudice, 2 CR 255, and\n                               the trial court lifted its stay. The parties\n                               completed discovery and filed cross-\n                               motions for summary judgment.\nTrial Court’s Disposition      The trial court granted Master’s motion for\n                               summary judgment and entered final\n                               judgment in Master’s favor. 5 CR 773.\n\n\n\n\nBrief of Appellant MJS                                             Page xi\n\f                Statement Regarding Oral Argument\n      This is a case of first impression in the nation. Master claims, and the\n\ntrial court agreed, that the federal False Claims Act insulates her from civil\n\nliability for taking and disclosing her employer’s confidential information,\n\nsolely because that information was used to file a qui tam action. But the\n\nqui tam defendant was MJS’s client, not MJS. No court in the nation has\n\napplied the Act to protect qui tam relators from liability to third parties\n\nsuch as MJS that were not accused of committing fraud against the U.S.\n\n      By granting Master’s motion for summary judgment, the trial court\n\nhas, in effect, ruled that confidentiality agreements are ineffective against\n\nthose who wish to take confidential information from one party and initiate\n\na qui tam action against another party in the hopes of receiving large\n\nmonetary rewards. In light of the important and novel questions presented\n\nby this appeal, the Court may wish to hear oral argument.\n\n\n\n\nBrief of Appellant MJS                                                Page xii\n\f                             Issues Presented\n      First Issue: No court has ever held that the False Claims Act permits\n\na qui tam relator to steal information belonging to a party not accused of\n\nany illegal conduct and disclose it. Master agreed not to take or disclose any\n\nconfidential information to which she had access during her employment,\n\nbut she did so anyway, and received $12 million as a result. Was Master’s\n\nconduct protected under the federal statute?\n\n      Second Issue: The trial court erred granting summary judgment on\n\ncausation based on an incompetent affidavit not made on personal\n\nknowledge that only addressed one category of damages, and because the\n\nallegation in the affidavit—that LHC terminated its contract with MJS due\n\nto MJS’s poor performance—is contradicted by evidence that LHC did so\n\nbecause Master used its privileged and confidential information to initiate a\n\nqui tam action, thus raising a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n      Third Issue: The trial court erred in granting no-evidence summary\n\njudgment against MJS after MJS submitted more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence to establish each disputed element of its claims.\n\n\n\n\nBrief of Appellant MJS                                               Page xiii\n\f                               Introduction\n      This appeal raises a question of first impression in the nation.\n\n      In the three months that Master worked for MJS, she purloined\n\nMJS’s confidential, trade secret, and privileged information so that she\n\ncould file a complaint under the False Claims Act against MJS’s largest\n\nclient. As a result, MJS lost its largest client and was disparaged in the\n\nmedia, leading to further business losses. But MJS, which is in the business\n\nof auditing health care providers to ensure that they comply with\n\ngovernment regulations, did nothing wrong. Meanwhile, Master’s breaches\n\nof her confidentiality obligations allowed her to reap a reward in excess of\n\n$12 million.\n\n      When MJS sued Master under Texas law for breaching her\n\nobligations, she insisted that her conduct was protected under the Act and\n\nthat MJS was without recourse. The only court in the nation to address that\n\nquestion—the federal court that remanded this suit after Master tried to\n\nremove it—concluded that the Act has no bearing on MJS’s purely state-law\n\nclaims. Nevertheless, the trial court accepted Master’s overtures that the\n\nAct insulated her from liability and granted summary judgment. That\n\ndecision, if permitted to stand, would have a crippling effect on confidential\n\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                  Page 1\n\frelationships traditionally subject to state regulation, and this Court should\n\nreverse.\n\n                                 Statement of Facts\n\nI.    The False Claims Act Litigation Against MJS’s Client, LHC\n      A.       Attorneys for LHC Hired MJS to Perform Health Care\n               Compliance Audits\n      MJS is a healthcare consulting firm owned and operated by Jan and\n\nCharlie Spears.1 It provides a wide array of services to health care providers,\n\nincluding auditing services to ensure compliance with government\n\nMedicare and Medicaid regulations.2\n\n      LHC Group, LLC is one of the largest providers of home health and\n\nhospice services in the nation.3 In early 2005, attorneys from the Gachassin\n\nLaw Firm hired MJS to provide external compliance audits for their client,\n\nLHC Group, LLC, “to assist their legal representation and advice [to their]\n\nclient.”4 LHC provided documentation to MJS that MJS reviewed using\n\nspecially-developed, proprietary software called The Auditor.5 MJS\n\nassessed LHC’s compliance with federal and state regulations, accreditation\n\n\n\n      1   4 CR 509.\n      2   4 CR 509, ¶¶ 2-3.\n      3   4 CR 618.\n      4   4 CR 509, ¶ 4; 4 CR 517-18.\n      5   4 CR 523.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                 Page 2\n\fstandards, and agency policies and procedures. It then provided reports to\n\nthe attorneys on a secure, password-protected website.6\n\n        The contract between MJS, the attorneys, and LHC stated that all\n\ninformation provided to MJS would be confidential and subject to the\n\nattorney-client and work product privileges.7 It included a detailed\n\nconfidentiality provision. Under the terms of that provision, MJS agreed\n\nthat (1) MJS’s services were confidential and performed under the direction\n\nand control of the attorneys, (2) MJS’s reports would remain confidential,\n\n(3) MJS would provide all reports directly to the attorneys, not LHC, and\n\n(4) MJS would notify the attorneys of any third-party request concerning\n\nLHC and follow the attorneys’ directions in responding.8\n\n        With respect to the information it received from LHC, MJS agreed\n\nthat:\n\n                MJS would use the material solely for the purpose of\n                 performing services for the attorneys and LHC;\n\n                MJS and its employees would keep the material “strictly\n                 confidential”;\n\n                MJS would inform its employees of the information’s\n                 confidential nature; and\n\n\n\n        6   4 CR 523, 525.\n        7   4 CR 517.\n        8   4 CR 518, ¶ 3(a).\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                             Page 3\n\f                MJS and its employees would not disclose to any person,\n                 including any governmental entity, the fact that an investigation\n                 was taking place.9\nFinally, MJS was required to immediately inform the attorneys of any\n\nrequest for information provided by LHC, and MJS agreed not to release\n\nany information until the latest reasonable date possible.10\n\n      As a home health care provider, LHC is subject to the Health\n\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 45 C.F.R. § 160 et\n\nseq. (2013), which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health\n\ninformation and imposes penalties for violations. Because MJS received\n\npersonal health information as part of its services for LHC, it, too, was\n\nsubject to HIPAA regulations. An addendum to the contract memorialized\n\nHIPPA’s disclosure restrictions and required MJS to ensure that its agents\n\nabided by the restrictions.11\n\n      In July 2007, MJS entered a new consultancy agreement with the\n\nGachassin Law Firm that expanded the scope of MJS’s services for LHC to\n\ninclude auditing hospice records and increased MJS’s compensation.12 The\n\nnew agreement contained confidentiality provisions identical to the\n\n\n\n      9    Id. at ¶ 3(b).\n      10   Id. at ¶ 3(c).\n      11   4 CR 532-35.\n      12   4 CR 510, ¶ 6; 4 CR 543-44.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                    Page 4\n\foriginal.13\n\n      LHC’s business grew, and by 2009, LHC served five times the number\n\nof home health locations as it had when MJS began consulting for it. As\n\nLHC grew, so too did MJS.14 In April 2008, MJS again negotiated higher\n\nrates for its consulting services for LHC.15\n\n      B.        MJS Hired Master, Who Agreed Not to Take MJS’s\n                Property or Disclose Its Confidential Information\n      In March 2007, MJS hired Master, a registered nurse, to work on\n\ncompliance audits, including those for LHC.16 As a condition of her\n\nemployment, Master signed an employment agreement and a statement of\n\nconfidentiality.17\n\n      Under the employment agreement, Master agreed that all “files,\n\nrecords, documents, specifications, equipment, and similar items” relating\n\nto MJS’s business were MJS’s “exclusive property” and that she would not\n\nremove them from MJS’s premises under any circumstances without MJS’s\n\nprior written consent.18 She also agreed that upon the end of her\n\n\n      134 CR 537-38. The 2007 Agreement incorporated a HIPAA addendum, although\nno addendum appears in the record. 4 CR 542, ¶ 13.\n      14   4 CR 510, ¶ 6.\n      15   Id. at ¶ 8.\n      16   Id. at ¶ 10.\n      17   4 CR 551-54.\n      18   4 CR 551, ¶ 1.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                 Page 5\n\femployment, she would return any MJS property.19\n\n     In the statement of confidentiality, Master further agreed that:\n\n               She understood “the importance of observing strict ethical,\n                moral, and professional standards with confidentiality policies”;\n\n               She would not discuss or release any information regarding any\n                of MJS’s clients with anyone not directly associated with MJS;\n\n               She would obtain MJS’s authorization prior to releasing any\n                information obtained at MJS;\n\n               She would not disclose or discuss treatment, financial, medical,\n                or social information relating to any patients of MJS’s clients\n                without written authorization from MJS management;\n\n               She would not conduct any research to seek out information not\n                required for her assigned duties; and\n\n               These confidentiality obligations would continue after her\n                employment with MJS ended.20\n     Master quit after less than three months on the job.21 She did not\n\nprovide any notice, but simply sent an email to her supervisor stating that\n\nshe was resigning “due to personal reasons” and that she had enjoyed\n\nworking with her supervisor and the MJS team.22\n\n\n\n\n     19   4 CR 551, ¶ 2.\n     20   4 CR 554.\n     21   4 CR 556.\n     22   Id.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                   Page 6\n\f      C.    Master Secretly Copied, Took, and Disclosed MJS’s\n            Confidential Information to Start a Qui Tam Suit\n            against LHC\n      Within a month of leaving MJS, Master filed a qui tam complaint\n\nagainst LHC in federal court in the Western District of Louisiana. The qui\n\ntam action was based exclusively on confidential documents and\n\ninformation she obtained during her brief employment with MJS.23 MJS\n\nknew nothing about Master’s qui tam action.\n\n      The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3730 (West 2010), permits an\n\nindividual to bring a qui tam action—a suit on her own behalf and in the\n\nname of the federal government—against an entity the individual believes\n\nhas presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government,\n\nincluding Medicare and Medicaid health care claims.

The purloined\n\ndocuments included patient records and Auditor reports.29 She also made\n\nhandwritten notes about MJS records and conversations she allegedly\n\noverheard between MJS employees.30 She conducted internet research\n\nabout qui tam suits and contacted an attorney specializing in\n\n“whistleblower” cases.31 She took home the documents and other\n\ninformation she obtained from MJS and turned them over to the attorney\n\nand later to the government.32\n\n\n\n\n      27   1 CR 86-88, ¶¶ 48-50.\n      281 CR 88-89, ¶ 53. The complaint also accused MJS of changing answers in the\nAuditor questionnaire to reduce LHC’s non-compliance rate. 1 CR 88-89, ¶¶ 52-55.\nMaster later testified that she did not know for sure that MJS changed any of her\nanswers, but had heard that they had. She did not know how the answers were\nsupposedly changed or who had changed them. 3 CR 443, 447.\n      29   3 CR 458-59; 4 CR 577-78.\n      30   3 CR 451; 4 CR 577-78.\n      31   4 CR 576.\n      32   3 CR 441-42, 464.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                    Page 9\n\f      Master never told MJS that she suspected fraud or that she intended\n\nto file a qui tam action against LHC. She did not obtain permission to take\n\nor disclose any of MJS’s information and did not tell anyone at MJS that\n\nshe was doing so.33 But Master attached to her qui tam complaint 128 pages\n\nof confidential materials that she took from MJS to support her allegations\n\nagainst LHC.34\n\n      Master knew she was not allowed to remove any documents from\n\nMJS’s premises or to disclose any of MJS’s or LHC’s information of any\n\nkind to anyone outside MJS.35 But she argued “that went out the door when\n\n[she] suspected fraud.”36 Whether Master’s obligations to MJS did indeed\n\ngo out the door when she formed suspicions about MJS’s client is the\n\ncentral issue in this appeal.\n\n      D.         LHC Canceled Its Contract with MJS\n      Because the complaint was initially filed under seal, MJS did not\n\nknow that Master took documents before she quit or that she had used that\n\ninformation to start a qui tam suit against MJS’s largest client.37\n\n\n\n      33   3 CR 458-59; 4 CR 511, 580.\n      34  4 CR 575, 579-81; 4 CR 514-15, ¶ 32.

The government eventually narrowed the subpoena to encompass\n\ndocuments related to LHC’s services to Medicare beneficiaries.39\n\n     During that time, LHC began assessing its compliance program.40 In\n\nApril 2009, it hired a new Chief Compliance Officer, Josh Proffitt.41 In June\n\n2009, Proffitt held a meeting in Atlanta to evaluate MJS’s audits, determine\n\nhow to respond to the government investigation and subpoena, and\n\ndetermine how to calculate how much LHC would have to reimburse the\n\ngovernment.42 MJS learned for the first time during that meeting that LHC\n\nhad not taken corrective action in response to MJS’s findings of non-\n\ncompliance in its auditing reports by reimbursing the government for non-\n\ncovered services.43\n\n\n\n\n     38   1 CR 115-17.\n     39   4 CR 511-12, ¶¶ 14, 20.\n     40   3 CR 433.\n     41   Id. at ¶ 2.\n     42   4 CR 511-12, ¶¶ 15-18.\n     43   4 CR 512, ¶ 16.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 11\n\f     Shortly after the meeting, on June 22, 2009, MJS responded to the\n\nsubpoena by producing the requested documents, as narrowed, to the\n\ngovernment.44 Three days later, Proffitt cancelled LHC’s contract with MJS\n\nwithout explanation and instructed MJS to terminate all services being\n\nperformed for LHC.45\n\n     According to Proffitt, LHC terminated its contract with MJS because\n\nit determined that MJS’s reports were too long, detailed, and inconsistent.46\n\nHe also claimed that “LHC would have terminated MJS regardless of\n\nwhether Judy Master filed the Complaint or whether the government\n\ninvestigated the same.”47 MJS’s owner, Jan Spears, on the other hand,\n\ntestified that LHC had never complained about the services MJS provided,\n\nnever mentioned that MJS’s reports were unduly burdensome or\n\nchallenging, and never told MJS that it was reevaluating its auditing\n\nfunctions.48\n\n\n\n\n     44   Id. at ¶ 19.\n     45   Id. at ¶ 20.\n     46   3 CR 434-35, ¶¶ 8-11.\n     47   3 CR 436.\n     48   4 CR 512-13, ¶¶ 20, 22-23.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                              Page 12\n\f       E.       Master Got Millions While MJS Nearly Went Broke\n       More than two years later, in September 2011, the government\n\nsettled its claims against LHC for $65 million plus interest.49 The\n\nagreement provided that Master would receive 19% of the settlement\n\namount, or $12.35 million plus interest, as well as over $1 million in\n\nattorney’s fees.50 But, Master did not tell the Louisiana federal court about\n\nthe settlement, so her qui tam action remained pending.51\n\n       Also in September 2011, the court unsealed the record in the qui tam\n\naction.52 Ten days later, an article about the suit and its settlement\n\nappeared in Home Health Line, a nationally-distributed health care\n\nindustry periodical.53 The article disclosed that Master initiated the suit\n\nagainst LHC and quoted extensively from her complaint.54 It also\n\ninsinuated, based on Master’s complaint, that MJS was complicit in LHC’s\n\nalleged fraud against the government, describing MJS’s purported\n\n\n\n       49   4 CR 619.\n       50   4 CR 620.\n       51   2 CR 223.\n       522 CR 214-15. The court’s order unsealing the qui tam record does not appear in\nthe appellate record, but is available on Pacer.

The Federal Court Rejected Master’s Argument that\n               Her Conduct Was Protected Under the Act\n      Master removed the suit to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Texas.61 The same day, she also joined MJS as a defendant in the\n\nstill ongoing qui tam action in the Western District of Louisiana, asserting\n\nclaims for retaliation under the Act62 and seeking a declaratory judgment\n\nthat the Act pre-empted MJS’s claims in Texas and protected her conduct\n\nin taking and disclosing MJS’s confidential materials.63\n\n      After removal, Master moved to dismiss MJS’s suit, or alternatively,\n\nto transfer it to the qui tam action in Louisiana. MJS moved to remand.64\n\nMaster argued that federal jurisdiction existed because MJS’s state-law\n\nclaims necessarily depended on a substantial question of federal law:\n\nwhether Master’s conduct was protected under the Act.65 She claimed, as\n\n\n\n      60   1 CR 8-24.\n      61   1 CR 122-23, 126.\n      62 Master alleged that MJS retaliated against her by instructing her to alter bills\nand harassing and discriminating against her when she complained and refused to\nparticipate in the alleged fraud involving LHC. She claimed post-termination retaliation\nbased on MJS suing her in this case. 2 CR 208.\n      63   2 CR 205, 211.\n      64   1 CR 128.\n      65   1 CR 133.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                         Page 15\n\fshe does now, that she cannot be liable for state-law claims related to her\n\nuse of documents in qui tam actions.66\n\n      The federal court rejected Master’s argument and granted MJS’s\n\nmotion to remand on April 2, 2012.67 The order explains several reasons\n\nwhy MJS’s claims do not implicate the Act:\n\n              The Act “would appear to have little bearing on whether or not\n               she—who quit her job only three months after being hired—\n               breached a confidentiality agreement”;\n\n              The Act’s purpose of preventing “harassment or retaliation\n               against would-be relators for lawful acts [] has little bearing on\n               whether Ms. Master can be civilly liable” for MJS’s claims;\n\n              This was especially true given that MJS was not the target of her\n               qui tam action;\n\n              Master did not cite any appellate decisions to support her\n               argument;\n\n              The four district court cases she cited involved preventing fraud\n               by the relator’s employer68 (not a client of the relator’s\n               employer, as here), and one of those cases seemed to contradict,\n               rather than support, Master’s argument; and\n\n              Even assuming that MJS’s claims require some reference to the\n               Act, the court was “far from convinced that the federal issue in\n               this case is substantial, rather than simply tangential.”69\n\n\n      66   1 CR 133.\n      67   1 CR 128-37.\n      68 The cases mentioned in the remand order are: U.S. ex rel.

The Trial Court Accepted Master’s Argument Under\n               the Act and Granted Summary Judgment Against MJS\n      Back in Texas, the trial court lifted its stay and set the case for trial in\n\nJune 2015.75 The parties conducted discovery and filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment in May 2015. MJS moved for no-evidence summary\n\njudgment on ten of Master’s affirmative defenses, including her claims that\n\nher conduct was “protected by the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3730(h)” and that “[i]t is against public policy for [MJS] to attempt to use\n\na contractual confidentiality agreement to try to thwart the purpose and\n\neffect of the federal False Claims Act.”76\n\n      Master filed a traditional and no-evidence motion, arguing primarily\n\nthat her conduct was protected by the language of the Act and policy behind\n\nit.77 The only summary judgment evidence she presented consisted of\n\nexcerpts from her own deposition testimony and Proffitt’s affidavit claiming\n\nthat LHC did not fire MJS because of Master’s actions.78 MJS responded\n\nwith evidence consisting of other excerpts from Master’s deposition\n\ntestimony,       Spears’s      affidavit,   the   confidentiality   agreement,   the\n\nemployment agreement, the 2005 and 2007 contracts between LHC and\n\n\n      75   2 CR 256-57, 262.\n      76   3 CR 406-18; see also 3 CR 397-98, ¶¶ 3-4.\n      77   3 CR 420-31.\n      78   3 CR 433-64.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                     Page 18\n\fMJS, Master’s email resignation, the qui tam settlement agreement, the\n\ndisparaging article, an LHC corporate disclosure, and an expert report on\n\ndamages. Master did not reply.79\n\n      On June 3 and 8, the trial court held a hearing on both parties’\n\nmotions.80 It granted Master’s motions for traditional and no-evidence\n\nsummary judgment in their entirety and entered an order to that effect on\n\nJune 8.81 The trial court later denied MJS’s motion to modify the judgment,\n\nand MJS timely appealed.82\n\n                           Summary of the Argument\n      Master is attempting to escape liability for stealing her employer’s\n\nconfidential, trade secret, and privileged information and using it to her\n\nown benefit. To do so, she convinced the trial court that the Act insulates\n\nher from MJS’s state-law claims because it required her to take the\n\ninformation and give it to the government.\n\n      For the Act to preempt MJS’s state-law claims, however, Master had\n\nto overcome a presumption against preemption and meet the high\n\nthreshold of establishing that the Act made compliance with her\n\n      79   4 CR 509-644.\n      80   2 RR; 3 RR.\n      81 5 CR 773; 3 RR 45. The trial court also granted MJS’s no-evidence motion on\nMaster’s defenses of unclean hands, ratification, and failure to mitigate, but denied the\nmotion as to Master’s other affirmative defenses. 5 CR 768.\n      82   5 CR 780-83.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                         Page 19\n\fconfidentiality obligations impossible. She did neither. The Act did not, in\n\nfact, require her to do anything. And it certainly did not require her to steal\n\nprotected information from a company that was not accused of fraud, but\n\nrather in the business of preventing noncompliance. Similarly, the policies\n\nbehind the Act do not invalidate her confidentiality obligations. Courts have\n\nenforced obligations concerning confidential, trade secret, and privileged\n\ninformation, even when those obligations are owed to an alleged\n\nfraudfeasor. But no court has ever held that a qui tam relator may breach\n\nits obligations to parties not accused of fraud.\n\n      The trial court further erred in accepting Master’s argument that MJS\n\ncannot establish causation because the only evidence Master relied upon\n\n(1) was not competent summary judgment evidence, (2) did not address\n\nevery category of damages MJS seeks, and (3) is controverted by MJS’s\n\nevidence, which raises a fact issue.\n\n      Finally, the trial court erred in granting Master’s no-evidence points\n\nbecause MJS presented more than a scintilla of evidence on each of the\n\nchallenged elements. The trial court’s summary judgment should be\n\nreversed and this case remanded for trial on the merits.\n\n\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 20\n\f                         Argument and Authorities\nI.

Master never accused MJS of committing fraud against the\ngovernment, and the Louisiana federal court dismissed the retaliation claim she brought\nagainst MJS after MJS sued her in this case. 1 CR 75; 2 CR 203-22.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                                       Page 21\n\ffind itself without [] recourse for Ms. Master’s use of confidential\n\ninformation to prove a fraud perpetrated by another entity.”84\n\n     Nevertheless, after remand, Master continued to argue that the Act is\n\nan affirmative defense to all of MJS’s claims against her.85 The trial court\n\nerred by accepting her argument and granting summary judgment,86 and\n\nthis Court should reverse.\n\n     A.

The court in Cuidado Casero held that there was more than\n\na scintilla of evidence to support a breach of fiduciary duty claim where the\n\nevidence showed that an employee of a home health care agency had access\n\nto confidential patient and Trade Secrets information that she used for her\n\nown benefit in violation of a confidentiality agreement. 404 S.W.3d at 753.\n\n      Master admits receiving confidential and proprietary information as\n\npart of her employment with MJS, and admits that she took that\n\ninformation in violation of the express language of her confidentiality\n\nagreements and disclosed it to third parties.107 As a result, Master benefited\n\nat MJS’s expense by receiving over $12 million while MJS’s business\n\nsuffered.108 The trial court erred in finding that there was no evidence that\n\nMaster breached a fiduciary duty to MJS.\n\n\n\n      107   3 CR 441-42.\n      108   4 CR 620; 4 CR 586-89.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                               Page 42\n\f      D.

Employee shall not\n     disclose any such trade secrets, directly or indirectly, nor use\n     them in any way. . . .110\nIt is undisputed that Master took information generated by MJS’s software\n\nand disclosed it to her attorneys and the government without MJS’s\n     109   See 4 CR 523-24.\n     110   4 CR 551.\n\n\nMJS’s Appellant’s Brief                                             Page 44\n\fknowledge or consent.

If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a\ncivil action under this section against the person.\n\n\n(b) Actions by private persons.--(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for\nthe United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only\nif the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.\n\n\n(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses\nshall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 1 The complaint shall be\nfiled in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.\nThe Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and\nthe material evidence and information.\n\n\n(3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains\nunder seal under paragraph (2). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant\nshall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served\nupon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall--\n\n\n  (A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or\n\n\n  (B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right\n  to conduct the action.\n\n\n(5) When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related\naction based on the facts underlying the pending action.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Civil actions for false claims, 31 USCA § 3730\n\n\n\n\n(c) Rights of the parties to qui tam actions.--(1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary\nresponsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall\nhave the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).\n\n\n(2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person\nhas been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for\na hearing on the motion.\n\n\n(B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if\nthe court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances.\nUpon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.\n\n\n(C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating\nthe action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant,\nor for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as--\n\n\n  (i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;\n\n\n  (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;\n\n\n  (iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or\n\n\n  (iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.\n\n\n(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating\nthe action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court\nmay limit the participation by the person in the litigation.\n\n\n(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct\nthe action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied\nwith copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court,\nwithout limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene\nat a later date upon a showing of good cause.\n\n\n(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery\nby the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil\nmatter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing\nshall be conducted in camera.

Civil actions for false claims, 31 USCA § 3730\n\n\n\n\n(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to\nthe Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is\npursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person\nwould have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other\nproceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding\nsentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States,\nif all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not\nsubject to judicial review.\n\n\n(d) Award to qui tam plaintiff.--(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such\nperson shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the\nproceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to\nthe prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific\ninformation (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a\ncriminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government 2 Accounting Office report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more\nthan 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the\naction in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall\nbe made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to\nhave been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded\nagainst the defendant.\n\n\n(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim\nshall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall\nbe not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of\nsuch proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily\nincurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.\n\n\n(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who\nplanned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the\ncourt considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under\nparagraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any\nrelevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising\nfrom his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive\nany share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action,\nrepresented by the Department of Justice.\n\n\n(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may\naward to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds\nthat the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of\nharassment.\n\n\n(e) Certain actions barred.--(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the\narmed forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service\nin the armed forces.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For\nthe reasons set forth below, the motion is granted, with modifications.\n\n\nI. Background\nAs lead plaintiff in this action, Connecticut has been investigating acts of JDSU and the individual defendants relating to alleged\nartificial inflation of the price of JDSU securities during the putative class period of July 27, 1999 through July 26, 2001.\nInvestigators hired by lead counsel have identified and have spoken with numerous former employees of JDSU. Many of these\nformer employees have informed the investigators that they are willing to talk about relevant activities at JDSU during the class\nperiod, but they believe they are unable to do so because of one or more confidentiality agreements that they entered into with\nJDSU (or with companies later acquired by JDSU) at the time they were hired, at the time they were terminated, or both.\n\nOne such agreement is entitled “Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.” (Gottlieb Decl., Ex. A.) That\nagreement provides, in relevant part:\n\n  (a) Confidential Restrictions. I understand that, in the course of my work as an employee of the Company, I [have had and]\n  may have access to Proprietary Information (as defined below) concerning the Company. I acknowledge that the Company\n  has developed, compiled, and otherwise obtained, often at great expense, this information, which has great value to the\n  Company's business. I agree to hold in strict confidence and in trust for the sole benefit of the Company all Proprietary\n  Information and will not disclose any Proprietary Information, directly or indirectly, to anyone outside of the Company,\n  or use, copy, publish, summarize, or remove from Company premises such information (or remove from the premises any\n  other property of the Company) except (i) during my employment to the extent necessary to carry out my responsibilities\n  as en employee of the Company or (ii) after termination of my employment, as specifically authorized in writing by a duly\n  authorized officer of the Company. I further understand that the publication of any Proprietary Information through literature\n  or speeches must be approved in advance in writing by a duly authorized officer of the Company.\n\n  (b) Proprietary Information Defined. I understand that the term “Proprietary Information” in this Agreement means all\n  information and any idea in whatever form, tangible or intangible, whether disclosed to or learned or developed by me,\n  pertaining in any manner to the business of the Company or to the Company's affiliates, consultants, or business associates,\n  unless (i) the information is or becomes publicly known through lawful means; (ii) the information was rightfully in\n  my possession or part of my general knowledge prior to my employment by the Company; or (iii) the information is\n  disclosed to me without confidential or proprietary restriction by a third party who rightfully possesses the information\n  (without confidential or proprietary restriction) and did not learn of it, directly or indirectly, from the Company. I further\n  understand that the Company considers the following information to be included, without limitation, in the definition of\n  Proprietary Information: (A) notebooks, schematics, techniques, employee suggestions, development tools and processes,\n  computer printouts, computer programs, design drawings and manuals, and improvements; (B) information about costs,\n  profits, markets, and sales; (C) plans for future development and new product concepts; and (D) all documents, books, *1131\n  papers, drawings, models, sketches, and other data of any kind and description, including electronic data recorded or retrieved\n  by any means, that have been or will be given to me by the Company (or any affiliate of it), as well as written or verbal\n  instructions or comments.\n\n(Id. at 1.)\n\nAnother such agreement is entitled “Separation Agreement and General Release.” (Gottlieb Decl., Ex.

No proposed order has\nbeen submitted. Connecticut contends that to the extent JDSU seeks to use the agreements for purposes other than the protection\nof trade secrets, the agreements are unduly broad and should be deemed void as against public policy. Alternatively, Connecticut\nrequests “that the Court: (a) grant plaintiffs permission to depose a limited number of former JDS Uniphase employees prior\nto the Court's decision on the motion to dismiss, or (b) grant plaintiffs an adverse inference that, despite public disclosures to\nthe contrary, defendants were aware of the Company's sharply declining financial condition and results prior to their selling of\nmore than one billion dollars' worth of Company stock.” (Motion at 12.)\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Reform Act's ban on discovery during the pendency of a motion to dismiss does not bar plaintiffs' motion\nJDSU argues that Connecticut's motion is an impermissible attempt to evade the statutory restrictions on early discovery that\nare imposed by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“Reform Act”). 1 The purpose of the Reform Act was\n“to restrict abuses in securities class-action litigation, including: (1) the practice of filing lawsuits against issuers of securities\nin response to any significant change in stock price, regardless of defendants' culpability; (2) the targeting of “deep pocket”\ndefendants; (3) the abuse of the discovery process to coerce settlement; and (4) manipulation of clients by class action attorneys.”\nSG Cowen Securities Corporation v.

The Reform Act instituted a\nheightened pleading standard, and “mandated a stay of discovery during the pendency of a summary judgment or dismissal\nmotion.” Id.\n\n1       The Court has also received an opposition brief from defendant The Furukawa Electric Co. Ltd. (“Furukawa”), which correctly notes\n        that they are not a party to the confidentiality agreements at issue, and thus Connecticut's references to “defendants” should not be\n        taken to include Furukawa.\nUnder the Reform Act, “all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss,\nunless the court finds upon the motion of any party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent\nundue prejudice to that party.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(B). This section was “intended to prevent unnecessary imposition of\ndiscovery costs on defendants.” SG Cowen, 189 F.3d at 911 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, 104th Cong. 1st Sess. at 32\n(1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. Sess. 731). The Ninth Circuit has held that the Reform Act's discovery stay provision\n“clearly contemplates that ‘discovery should be permitted in securities class actions only after the court has sustained the legal\nsufficiency of the complaint.’ ” Id. at 912 (quoting *1133 S.Rep. No. 104-98, at 14 (1995), reprinted in U.S.C.C.A.N. 693).\nThus, the Ninth Circuit has construed the Reform Act's discovery stay to apply not only during the pendency of a motion to\ndismiss, but until the Court has sustained the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\n\nHere, there is no motion to dismiss pending, but the time for responding to the consolidated complaint has not yet elapsed.\nOn September 12, Judge Wilken signed a stipulation granting defendants until December 9 to respond to the consolidated\ncomplaint. JDSU's counsel indicated at the hearing that they are likely to file a motion to dismiss. As the Court has not yet\nsustained the legal sufficiency of the consolidated complaint, plaintiffs are not yet entitled to take discovery. Accordingly, under\nthe Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the Reform Act in SG Cowen, plaintiffs are not yet entitled to take discovery. Id.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the Reform Act's discovery stay. Discovery is stayed “unless the courts finds upon the motion of\nany party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice.” With respect to the\nfirst exception, there is not a hint of a suggestion in the plaintiff's papers that there is an urgent need to preserve evidence. As\nfor the second exception, the Ninth Circuit has held that a plaintiff's inability, without discovery, to obtain the facts needed\nto meet the Reform Act's heightened pleading requirements is not the sort of “undue prejudice” contemplated by the Reform\nAct. SG Cowen, 189 F.3d at 913.\n\n             The Act requires the trial court to dismiss the complaint if it fails to satisfy the Act's heightened pleading\n             standards. See § 78u-4(b)(3)(A). Thus, as a matter of law, failure to muster facts sufficient to meet the\n             Act's pleading requirements cannot constitute the requisite “undue prejudice” to the plaintiff justifying a\n             lift of the discovery stay under § 78u-4(b)(3)(B). To so hold would contravene the purpose of the Act's\n             heightened pleading standards.\n\nId. Thus, plaintiffs have not shown any justification for lifting the Reform Act's discovery stay to allow them to take depositions\nbefore the Court rules on the upcoming motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In essence, what the\nplaintiffs are asking for is an order from the Court allowing former JDSU employees to speak voluntarily to plaintiffs' lead\ncounsel about certain topics without fear of breaching JDSU's confidentiality agreements. This is not discovery, because\nplaintiffs are not using court process to require these third parties to provide information about the lawsuit. Instead, plaintiffs\nare merely seeking an order that would allow former employees to speak voluntarily if they wish to do so.\n\nJDSU argues, however, that Connecticut's motion falls within the scope of the Reform Act's stay of “all discovery and other\nproceedings.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(B) (emphasis added). In Medhekar v. United States District Court, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728794\"><a href=\"/opinion/728794/ajit-k-medhekar-sid-agrawal-cn-reddy-cn-reddy-investments-inc-n/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\nCir.1996), the Ninth Circuit was asked to determine whether initial disclosures are stayed under the Reform Act during the\npendency of a motion to dismiss. The court held that initial disclosures are discovery, and therefore are included in the Reform\nAct's stay of discovery until the district court upholds the complaint. Id. The court then went on to hold that even if initial\ndisclosures are not the same as discovery, they are at a minimum included in the Reform Act's stay of “discovery and other\nproceedings.” Id. In defining the term “other proceedings,” the Ninth Circuit held that “[g]iven the context and legislative\nhistory of the Act, it *1134 appears that the term was intended to include litigation relating to discovery, which would certainly\ninclude disclosures and would not, as real party fears, include all litigation activity in general.” Id.\n\nHere, however, Connecticut does not seek discovery, but merely seeks a ruling on the scope of JDSU's confidentiality\nagreements with its former employees, so that it may speak with former employees who wish to voluntarily cooperate with\nConnecticut's investigation. Unlike discovery and initial disclosures, these interviews are not compelled by the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure. Neither the former employees nor the defendants are required to participate in these interviews in any way.\nThe Court agrees with In re Tyco International Ltd. Securities Litigation, 2001 U.S. Dist. Lexis 819 (D.N.H.2001), in which the\ndistrict court declined to prohibit voluntary discussions between plaintiffs and third party witnesses because “[n]either logic,\ntradition, the constitution nor the PSLRA prohibit interviewing prospective witnesses.” Id. at *8. In fact, the Reform Act's\nheightened pleading standard encourages plaintiffs to do more investigation before filing a complaint, not less.\n\nIn re Flir Systems Inc. Securities Litigation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33201904</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.Or.2000) is also instructive. In Flir, the court was asked to\npermit a deposition of Palmquist, a former employee of the defendant, during the discovery stay. The court distinguished SG\nCowen by noting that discovery was not being sought against the defendant, but against a third party, and thus the discovery\nwould not impose any significant burden on the defendant. Id. at *2. Because Palmquist had filed a civil complaint in state court\nalleging accounting fraud by the defendant, the court found that the proposed discovery was not a mere fishing expedition.\nId. The court also noted that the only reason Palmquist would not talk to the plaintiffs voluntarily was that defendants were\nasserting a confidentiality provision in Palmquist's employment contract. Id. at *3. The court found that the Reform Act “is a\nshield intended to protect security-fraud defendants from costly discovery requirements, [citation omitted], not to be a sword\nwith which defendants can destroy the plaintiffs' ability to obtain information from third parties who are otherwise willing to\ndisclose it.” Id. It is questionable whether Flir 's holding that plaintiffs could depose Palmquist is consistent with SG Cowen.\nThe Court agrees, however, with the Flir court's conclusion that the Reform Act was not intended to provide defendants with\nthe means to bar all investigation into their conduct. The Reform Act was not intended to provide defendants with immunity\nfrom suit, but, rather, was intended to protect defendants from the burdens of defending against frivolous litigation.\n\nPlaintiffs' proposed interviews with former employees of JDSU do not impose any burden or cost on JDSU. The Court finds\nthat plaintiffs' proposed voluntary interviews with former employees do not fall within the scope of “discovery.” Accordingly,\nthe Reform Act's ban on discovery during the pendency of a motion to dismiss has no application to plaintiffs' motion.\n\n\nB. The merits of plaintiffs' motion\nConnecticut states that it has no interest in any information that could be construed as a trade secret, and is willing to discuss\nreasonable measures to accommodate any legitimate concerns of JDSU with respect to use of the information obtained from\nformer employees in the course of its investigation. In Connecticut's reply brief, it provides examples of the types of questions\nthat it wishes to ask former employees, all of which relate directly to the *1135 allegations of wrongdoing that are at issue\nin this case. None of these questions appears to implicate any trade secrets of JDSU, or any other information that JDSU can\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, contrary to JDSU's attempts at misdirection, the issue is not whether JDSU can lawfully\nenter into contracts with its employees to protect its confidential business information and trade secrets.

Plaintiffs sought an order authorizing them to inform those former employees that\nthey could safely disregard agreements with the defendant not to disclose various types of information. The court recognized\nthe legitimacy of agreements between employers and employees that are designed to protect dissemination of confidential\ninformation. Id. at 444. The court also held, however, that:\n\n            It has been recognized that at least in some circumstances, agreements obtained by employers requiring\n            former employees to remain silent about underlying events leading up to disputes, or concerning\n            potentially illegal practices when approached by others can be harmful to the public's ability to rein in\n            improper behavior, and in some contexts ability of the United States to police violations of its laws.\n            Absent possible extraordinary circumstances not present here, it is against public policy for parties to\n            agree not to reveal, at least in the limited contexts of depositions or pre-deposition interviews concerning\n            litigation arising under federal law, facts relating to alleged or potential violations of such law.\n\nId. (footnote omitted). The Court also noted that “agreements restricting former employee revelation of events in the workplace\nwhich are not privileged but may involve violations of federal law have the effect of ‘hindering’ implementation of the\n‘Congressionally mandated duty to enforce the provisions' of federal statutes.” Id. (quoting EEOC v. United States Steel,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2595225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2595225/eeoc-v-us-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court declined to authorize plaintiffs' counsel to tell former employees that they\nneed not be concerned about the confidentiality agreements, however, because such a remedy “would make plaintiff's counsel\nthe decisionmaker concerning what confidentiality requirements were related to genuine trade secrets or other legitimately\nprivileged information, and which dealt with concealment of information relating to potential improprieties on the part of the\nemployee.” Id. at 445. Instead, it ordered the defendant to either (1) notify all former employees whom plaintiff wanted to\ninterview, in writing, that no unfavorable consequences for the employees would flow from providing information to plaintiffs'\ncounsel about specific subjects, or (2) accept an adverse inference that the information, if disclosed, would be contrary to\ndefendant's position. Id.\n\n            If applied to depositions or pre-deposition interviewing with respect to litigation under federal substantive\n            law, agreements calling or appearing to call for silence concerning matters relevant to alleged legal\n            violations, whether or not such agreements are sought to be enforced, inherently chill communication\n            relevant to the litigation. Where conduct of a party tends to preclude availability of information relevant\n            to a litigation and where no genuine basis for keeping that information confidential exists, *1136 a\n            court or factfinder may infer that the information, if disclosed, would be contrary to the position of the\n            party engaging in such conduct.\n\nId.\n\nAnother case from the Southern District of New York also held that “[d]isclosures of wrongdoing do not constitute revelations\nof trade secrets which can be prohibited by agreements binding on former employees.” McGrane v.

At oral argument, defendants correctly pointed out that this section\nonly applied to investigations conducted by the government, or by the company itself. Nonetheless, the statute demonstrates\nthe public policy in favor of allowing even current employees to assist in securities fraud investigations. It certainly does not\nestablish a public policy in favor of allowing employers to muzzle their employees with overbroad confidentiality agreements.\n\nOther than their argument that plaintiffs are attempting to circumvent the discovery stay provision of the Reform Act, JDSU\nprovides very few specific arguments against plaintiff's motion, relying instead primarily on straw-man arguments about the\nvalidity of confidentiality agreements in general. JDSU argues that it used several types of agreements containing provisions\ndesigned to protect its confidential and competitively sensitive business information, and that the form of those agreements\nevolved over the years. (DeWees Decl. ¶¶ 10, 14.) JDSU does not state, however, that these agreements differed in any material\nway from the sample agreements provided by Connecticut. In any event, the issue is not about the specific language of any\nof these agreements, but whether JDSU can ever enforce these types of agreements against former employees to prevent them\nfrom providing non-tradesecret, unprivileged information about JDSU's allegedly illegal activities.\n\nJDSU does point to Patton v. Cox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776111\"><a href=\"/opinion/776111/mark-k-patton-md-a-single-man-v-lynn-jacob-cox-wife-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.2002), however, which arguably provides some support to JDSU's\nposition. In that case, a doctor, Cox, conducted a court-ordered psychological examination of the plaintiff, Patton, allegedly\npursuant to an oral agreement with Patton to keep the results of the examination confidential. Id. at 494. Patton and his former\nwife were involved in a bitter child custody dispute, and Patton's teenage sister-in-law had alleged that Patton had engaged in\nimproper sexual conduct with her. Id. at 494, 501. Patton was also a doctor, and as a result of his sister-in-law's allegations,\nthe Arizona Board of Medical Examiners (“BOMEX”) filed a complaint against him for unprofessional conduct and unfitness\nto practice medicine. Id. at 494. Dr. Cox voluntarily testified at the BOMEX hearing, and revealed that as a result of his\nexamination of Patton, he believed that Patton was a pedophile and a danger to children. Id. at 495. Patton then sued Dr. Cox\nfor breach of contract. Id.\n\nThe district court granted Dr. Cox's motion to dismiss on the ground that absolute witness immunity precluded any liability\narising from Dr. Cox's testimony at a quasi-judicial hearing. Id. The Ninth Circuit *1137 reversed, applying Arizona law. The\nCourt recognized that Dr. Cox served the public interest by bringing to light the potential danger facing Patton's young, female\npatients. Id. at 498. Nonetheless, the court concluded that:\n\n  applying our perception of Arizona law, we hold that witness immunity does not bar an action for breach of contract when,\n  as in this case, the witness participated voluntarily in a quasi-judicial proceeding. This ruling will not hinder “the resolution\n  of disputes and the ascertainment of truth,” [citation omitted] because witnesses can be compelled to testify as needed, which\n  would then trigger immunity protection.\n\nId. at 500. The Ninth Circuit noted that because Dr. Cox voluntarily entered into the confidentiality agreement, “[h]e chose to\nlimit his ability to share information he obtained about Dr. Patton, and he was not at liberty to breach his obligation even if he\nfelt it was in the public's best interest to do so.” Id.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit did not discuss whether such agreements would be unenforceable in violation of public policy, and thus Patton\ndoes not directly conflict with Chambers. Nonetheless, by holding that the public interest did not trump Cox's confidentiality\nagreement with Patton, a reasonable argument could be made that the Ninth Circuit would not find the confidentiality agreements\nat issue here to be in violation of public policy, at least under Arizona law. This Court, of course, is applying federal law. Patton\nis also distinguishable because, unlike the instant case, Patton involved disclosure of private medical information, which is\nat the core of an individual's right to privacy. See id. (“we cannot help but consider the reasonable expectation of Dr. Patton\nthat this extremely private information would not be disseminated beyond the scope of the Utah court order.”) Highly personal\nmedical information is the sort of information, like trade secrets, that a party unquestionably has the right to ask another party\nto keep confidential.\n\nHere, however, JDSU's confidentiality agreements are so broad that they cover information that cannot possibly be considered\nconfidential.

Unlike the agreement at issue in\nPatton, which the court found was voluntarily entered into, plaintiffs stated at the hearing that this agreement was imposed on a\nformer employee in a mass layoff as a condition of receiving severance benefits. Defense counsel acknowledged that plaintiffs'\ncharacterization may be correct. To the extent that this agreement can be read to prohibit an employee from providing any\ninformation about any wrongdoing by JDSU, it is plainly unenforceable.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that Chambers is more applicable here than Patton. The Court agrees with the Chambers court\nthat JDSU cannot use its confidentiality agreements to chill former employees from voluntarily participating in legitimate\ninvestigations into alleged wrongdoing by JDSU. JDSU unquestionably has a legitimate interest in preventing dissemination of\ntrade secrets and confidential business information, however. In order to properly balance these competing interests between\nConnecticut and JDSU, the Court *1138 also agrees with the Chambers court that the appropriate remedy is not to allow\nplaintiffs to be the sole arbiters of whether their investigation avoids infringing on legitimate confidentiality concerns.\n\nThe Court finds that the procedural restrictions imposed in Chambers are unduly cumbersome and elaborate, however. Rather\nthan requiring the defendants to provide written notice to all former employees that plaintiff wished to interview, or accept an\nadverse inference, as in Chambers, the Court will simply rule that answering the questions set forth in plaintiffs' reply brief\nand the additional question requested at the hearing do not violate JDSU's confidentiality agreements. In addition, the Court\nwill require the parties to enter into a protective order providing that any information plaintiffs learn during the course of these\ninterviews may be used only for purposes of this litigation. This will be far less intimidating to the former employee, and far\nless intrusive to the plaintiffs' investigation, than requiring the plaintiffs to provide JDSU with the name of each person they\nwish to interview and requiring JDSU's counsel to attend each interview. By issuing this order restricting the interviews to\nthe questions that plaintiffs have requested, and to narrow followup questions on those topics, the risk that the interviews will\nexpand into areas of legitimate concern to JDSU is minimized.\n\n\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court grants Connecticut's motion to limit the scope of confidentiality agreements signed\nby former JDSU employees, with the following restrictions:\n\n1. All former employees of JDSU may answer the following questions, and any followup questions on the same topic, without\nfear of breaching any confidentiality agreement with JDSU:\n\n  a. At what time during the Class Period did you become aware of a significant downturn in JDSU sales or sale/revenue\n  projections?\n\n  b. Do you have any reason to believe that JDSU managers, officers or directors became aware of that downtown in sales or\n  projections at any time during the Class Period?\n\n  c. At what time during the Class Period did you become aware of a significant decrease in purchasing (including cancellation\n  or modification or contracts) by JDSU?\n\n  d. Do you have any reason to believe that JDSU managers, officers or directors became aware of that downturn in purchasing\n  (or cancellation or modification of contracts) by JDSU?\n\n  e. At what time during the Class Period did you become aware of a downturn in JDSU's production needs, e.g., eliminating\n  work shifts, reducing overtime, instituting a hiring freeze?\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BACKGROUND\n\nHurricane Katrina made landfall on the Mississippi Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005. As a result of the damages caused by the\nhurricane, Northrop Grumman Corporation (“NGC”) made claims on an insurance policy issued to a subsidiary of NGC by\nMunich Re, an insurance company represented by attorney Gerald Fisher (“Fisher”).

Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\nFisher, on behalf Munich Re, entered into a confidentiality agreement with NGC dated October 24, 2006, governing the use of\ndocuments produced by NGC. Fisher Aff. ¶ 7 [11 (Attach.“A”), 26 of 86]; Confidentiality Agreement [11, 56 of 85].\n\nBy April 2010, NGC and Munich Re had commenced arbitration proceedings in London, England, to resolve coverage disputes\nwhich had arisen related to NGC's claim for insurance benefits (“UK Arbitration”). Fisher, along with attorney Donald Holmes\n(“Holmes”), represented Munich Re in the UK Arbitration. Mem. in Supp. of Relators' Mot. to Allow Them to Provide\nInformation to Assist the [DOJ] in Its Investigation 7 [11, 12 of 86] (“Relators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ”). Fisher and Holmes filed\na complaint on behalf of Munich Re on April 6, 2010, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to\nobtain documents from the United States Navy (“the Navy”) purportedly for use in the UK Arbitration. Compl. 1[1], Case No.\n1:10–cv–00551–JEB (D.D.C.) (the “Touhy Action”). On June 2, 2010, while both the UK Arbitration and the Touhy Action\nremained pending, Fisher and Holmes filed the Complaint [1] in this case under seal in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia against NGC, Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Corporation, and Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc.\n(collectively, “Northrop Grumman”), under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733 (“FCA”). 2\nThe United States has declined to intervene in this case. Notice of Election to Decline Intervention 1[20].\n\n2      “The FCA's qui tam provisions permit a private individual, as a relator, to sue on the United States' behalf to recover for false claims\n       for payment submitted to the Government.” United States ex rel.

App'x</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892\n       (5th Cir.2013).\n *2 On August 18, 2012, prior to the transfer of the case, Fisher apparently decided to withdraw from serving as a relator, and\nHolmes filed the operative First Amended Complaint [43] in this case. Holmes alleges that “[t]his case is a civil false claims\naction brought on behalf of the United States by [Holmes], who has properly gained access to documents and information\nshowing that the U.S. Government has been defrauded in the amount of not less than $835 million by the unlawful actions of”\nNorthrop Grumman. First Am. Compl. 5[43]. Holmes asserts that prior to Hurricane Katrina's landfall, Northrop Grumman was\nbehind “in its budget in the performance” of various shipbuilding contracts with the Navy. Id. at 6. Holmes notes that “[w]ithin\nmonths after Hurricane Katrina ..., Congress appropriated $2.3 billion to the Navy in restricted emergency shipbuilding and\nconversion funding [ ] (hereinafter ‘the Katrina Money’)....” Id. at 7. According to Holmes, the Katrina Money “was to be\nused only for ‘the consequences' of” Hurricane Katrina, but Northrop Grumman filed false claims with the Navy by seeking\nreimbursement for unrelated cost overruns which it experienced before and after Hurricane Katrina, thus allowing Northrop\nGrumman to avoid the consequences of its alleged inefficiency and mistakes. Id. at 7–11.\n\nOn the basis of these allegations, Holmes advances claims for violations of the FCA. Am. Compl. 15–24[1]. Holmes maintains\nthat Northrop Grumman violated the FCA by misusing restricted Congressional funding to cover cost overruns on contracts\nfor which Northrop Grumman was financially responsible and by using “[a]rtifices and [d]evices” to deceive the Navy into\npaying for Northrop Grumman's non-Katrina related cost overruns. Id. at 15–20. Holmes further asserts that Northrop Grumman\nviolated the FCA by providing untruthful information to the Navy and Congress to prevent them from making accurate\nprocurement decisions, to conceal the status of contract performance related to seven shipbuilding contracts, and to prevent\ndiscovery of the fact that Northrop Grumman was not keeping separate accounting records which segregated Hurricane Katrina's\nmonetary consequences from unrelated costs. Id. at 20–23.\n\nNorthrop Grumman now moves to disqualify Holmes from serving as a relator and to dismiss the First Amended Complaint\nbased on alleged ethical violations committed by Holmes. Mem. Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Disqualify Relator and Dismiss First\nAm. Compl. 1[153]. According to Northrop Grumman, Holmes has breached his ethical duties of obedience to court orders,\ncandor and honesty to the courts and to Northrop Grumman, respect for Northrop Grumman's legal rights, and loyalty to his\nformer client, Munich Re. Id. at 12–13. Northrop Grumman maintains that Holmes' conduct was not authorized or required by\neither the FCA or misprision of felony statute, 18 U.S.C. § 4. Id. at 19–24.\n\nHolmes offers excerpts from various prior filings which he asserts address Northrop Grumman's Motion [151]. Resp. in Opp'n\nto Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 2–9[156]. Holmes claims that “[f]ederal courts have repeatedly held that confidentiality\nagreements are not a bar to the disclosure of fraud to the government” and posits that such holdings are “directly applicable”\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Holmes asserts that Munich Re had no objection to his decision to report Northrop Grumman's alleged fraud to\nthe United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Id. at 8–9. Holmes also acknowledges that he violated the terms of a Stipulated\nProtective Order issued by the Court in the Touhy Action and notes that “with 20/20 hindsight, he should have handled the\nsituation differently[,]” but Holmes appears to argue the Order is not entitled to be accorded the weight of a court order. Id.\nat 10–11. Holmes also posits that the ethical nature of his conduct should not be considered because the FCA preempts the\nethical rules governing his conduct.

Legal Standard\n *3 In allowing an attorney to serve as a relator and finding the attorney was nevertheless still required to abide by his ethical\nobligations as an attorney, one court has reasoned that “[w]hile the [FCA] permits any person ... to bring a qui tam suit, it\ndoes not authorize that person to violate state laws in the process.” United States ex rel. Doe v. X Corp. (“X Corp. II”), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1507 (E.D.Va.1994). Although attorneys may act as relators pro se, non-attorneys are prohibited from proceeding\nas relators pro se. See, e.g., Timson v. Sampson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77929\"><a href=\"/opinion/77929/timson-v-sampson/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 873–74 (11th Cir.2008) (finding that a non-attorney was “not\n[authorized to] maintain a qui tam suit under the FCA as a pro se relator”). A primary policy reason for this prohibition is that\n“[l]awyers are bound to ethical constraints to which non-lawyers may have no knowledge and no obligation[, and v]iolation\nof these fundamental canons may result in serious consequences to the errant attorney.” United States ex rel. Schwartz v. TRW\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357473\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357473/us-ex-rel-schwartz-v-trw-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 995 (C.D.Cal.2000). Furthermore, “[a]n attorney ‘has an obligation which he owes to the court[ ... ],\nand he owes a public duty to aid in the administration of justice, to uphold the dignity of the court and respect its authority.’ “ Id.\n(quoting United States v. Onan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"227419\"><a href=\"/opinion/227419/united-states-v-onan-two-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6–7 (8th Cir.1951)). These ethical obligations and the consequences of breaching\nthem remain applicable to attorneys proceeding as relators pro se. See X–Corp. II, 862 F.Supp. at 1507 (“[S]tate statutes and\nrules that regulate an attorney's disclosure of client confidences” apply in the context of a qui tam action, and attorneys serving\nas relators therefore have “significant incentives ... to abide by their” state law obligations in light of this fact and “given the\nexistence of state disciplinary powers over attorneys....”). Because Holmes is permitted to act as a relator pro se in this matter\ndue to his status as an attorney, the Court will evaluate whether he should be disqualified from serving as a relator by reference\nto the rules of professional conduct governing Holmes as an attorney.\n\nAn attorney's breach of his ethical obligations may be raised in a motion to disqualify counsel, which is a “substantive\nmotion[ ] ... determined by applying standards developed under federal law .” In re Am.

(quoting Dresser, 972 F.2d at 544) (internal marks omitted). Disqualification of counsel\n“is a sanction that must not be imposed cavalierly[,]” and the record must reveal “at least a reasonable possibility that some\nidentifiable impropriety actually occurred [ ]” before disqualification will be justified. Id. at 1316.\n\n\nB. Analysis\n\n1. The Court Will Consider the Ethical Nature of Holmes' Conduct\n *4 Insofar as Holmes takes the position that the ethical nature of his conduct is not relevant because the FCA preempts the\nethical rules governing his conduct, this argument is not persuasive. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss\n10–11[156]. Courts addressing the issue of whether the FCA preempts state ethics rules have declined to find preemption.

Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\nUnited States v. Quest Diagnostics Inc., the Second Circuit Court of Appeals refused to conclude that the FCA preempts the\nState of New York's ethical rules governing attorneys' conduct. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163 (2d Cir.2013) (“Nothing in the [FCA] evinces\na clear legislative intent to preempt state statutes and rules that regulate an attorney's disclosure of client confidences.”) (citing\nBates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142892\"><a href=\"/opinion/142892/bates-v-dow-agrosciences-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449 (2005)). Holmes' position is further refuted by the fact that non-lawyers are\nprohibited from proceeding pro se as qui tam relators while lawyers may proceed pro se as qui tam relators due to the ethical\nobligations to which lawyers remain bound and may be subjected to discipline for violating. See Schwartz, 118 F.Supp.2d at\n995 (quoting Onan, 190 F.2d at 6–7). Accordingly, the Court rejects Holmes' invitation to ignore the ethical implications of\nhis conduct.\n\n\n2. Holmes Has Breached Various Standards of Ethics\nIn assessing the entirety of Holmes' conduct related to this case, the Court must identify the applicable “local and national\nethical” standards. See U.S. Fire, 50 F.3d at 1314 (citation omitted). Much of Holmes' conduct occurred while the case was\npending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. This Court therefore will look to “the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct[, ]as adopted by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals” (“DCRPC”). D.D.C. Loc. R. 83.15(a).\nThe Local Uniform Civil Rules for the Northern and Southern Districts of Mississippi provide that the Mississippi Rules of\nProfessional Conduct (“MRPC”) govern litigants practicing in this Court, and thus the Court will also consider the MRPC\ngiven the transfer of the case to this Court. See L.U. Civ. R. 83.1(c). In addition, the Fifth Circuit recognizes the American Bar\nAssociation's Model Rules of Professional Conduct (“ABA Model Rules”) as “the national standards utilized by this circuit\nin ruling on disqualification motions.” Am. Airlines, 972 F.2d at 610. Because of the unique procedural history of this case,\nthe Court will consider the totality of Holmes' conduct related to this case in light of the ethical standards set forth in both the\nDCRPC and MRPC, as well as those of the ABA Model Rules.\n\n\na. Holmes Violated His Duty of Candor\nThe record reveals that Holmes has violated his ethical duty to act with candor. “A lawyer shall not knowingly: (1) make a\nfalse statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the\ntribunal by the lawyer....” ABA Model Rule 3.3(a)(1); see also DCRPC 3.3(a)(1) (same); MRPC 3.3(a)(1) (“A lawyer shall\nnot knowingly ... make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal....”). Additionally, “[i]n the course of representing\na client a lawyer shall not knowingly[ ] ... make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person....” ABA Model\nRule 4.1(a); see also DCRPC 4.1(a) (same); MRPC 4.1(a) (same). “It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in\nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation....” ABA Model Rule 8.4(c); DCRPC 8.4(c) (same); MRPC\n8.4(c) (same).\n\n\n*5 Holmes and Fisher filed the Touhy Action on April 6, 2010, pursuant, in part, to 28 U.S.C. § 1782, 3 and represented\nto the Court that Munich Re sought documents from the Navy “in aid of” the UK Arbitration. 4 Com pl. 1–4[1], Case No.\n1:10–cv–00551–JEB (D.D.C.). Northrop Grumman and Munich Re, through Holmes and Fisher, subsequently submitted a\nStipulated Protective Order, the terms of which were agreed upon by Munich Re, Northrop Grumman, and the Navy, which\nspecifically recited that Munich Re “has a need for the documents being produced by the U.S. Navy for the purposes of the UK\nArbitration[,] ... [and Munich Re] is agreeable to entering into this protective order and protecting the documents [produced by\nthe Navy] appropriately....” Stipulated Protective Order 3 [19–1], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB (D.D.C.). The parties' Stipulated\nProtective Order was entered on June 24, 2010, as an Order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\nOrder 1, Ex. A[20], Case No. 1:10–cv–00551–JEB (D.D.C.).\n\n3      Section 1782 allows parties to apply for and obtain an order that the Navy be required “to produce a document ... for use in a\n       proceeding in a foreign ... tribunal.” 28 U.S.C. § 1782(a).\n4      Munich Re, through Holmes and Fisher, filed an Amended Complaint [21] on May 3, 2010, but the allegations in the Amended\n       Complaint relevant to this Court's analysis do not differ from those of the Complaint.

Compl. 11[21].\nHolmes points out that this qui tam case was not filed until June 2, 2010, nearly two months after he and Fisher filed the Touhy\nAction, and Holmes appears to suggest that there cannot be a connection between documents sought from the Navy in the\npreviously filed Touhy Action and this qui tam case. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 7[156]. Holmes,\nhowever, acknowledges in the First Amended Complaint [43] he filed in this case that he had “gained access to documents\nand information showing that the U.S. Government has been defrauded” and explicitly based his claim on “documentation\nsubmitted by Northrop Grumman to the Navy....” Am. Compl. 5, 6, 10, 11[43]. 5 These allegations reveal Holmes' clear intent\nto support his qui tam claims in this case with the documents he obtained from the Navy through the Touhy Action purportedly\nfor use in the UK Arbitration. This calls into question the veracity of Holmes' statements made not only to the court in the Touhy\nAction as to why he sought the documents but also to this Court insofar as Holmes alleges he has “properly gained access to”\nthe documents upon which the First Amended Complaint is based. See, e .g., Am. Compl. 11[21], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB\n(D.D.C.) (alleging, through Holmes and Fisher, that Munich Re's “exercise of rights provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1782 are in aid of\nprivate foreign arbitration only”); Ex. “A” to Jt. Mot. to Enter Protective Order 3 [19–1], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB (D.D.C.)\n(submitting proposed stipulated protective order in which Munich Re, through Holmes and Fisher, recites that it “is agreeable\nto entering into this protective order and protecting the documents [produced by the Navy] appropriately”); First Am. Compl.\n5[43]. There is no evidence in the record that Holmes ever attempted to correct these statements. As a result, the Court finds\nthat Holmes violated his duty of candor by obtaining documents from the Navy through the Touhy Action without disclosing\nhis intent to use the documents to support his claims in this qui tam case.\n\n5      Holmes and Fisher even predicted in the original Complaint [1] that “[u]pon review of documents submitted by Northrop Grumman\n       to the [Navy], ... those records will show that Northrop Grumman also improperly used Katrina Money for pre-Katrina overruns....”\n       Compl. 8[1]. Though slightly rephrased, this allegation also appears in the First Amended Complaint [43] filed by Holmes. See First\n       Am. Compl. 11[43] (“[Holmes] alleges that the records submitted by Northrop Grumman to the Naval Sea Systems Command in\n       support of its claims for payment show that Northrop Grumman also improperly used Katrina Money for pre-Katrina overruns to\n       its subcontracts and material costs.”).\n\n\nb. Holmes and His Duty of Loyalty to Munich Re\n *6 Unless the client gives informed consent, “a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent\nconflict of interest.” ABA Model Rule 1.7(a). “A concurrent conflict of interest exists if[ ] ... there is a significant risk that\nthe representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to ... a third person or by a\npersonal interest of the lawyer.” Id. at 1.7(a)(2); see also DCRPC 1.7(b)(4) (“[A] lawyer shall not represent a client with respect\nto a matter if [ ] ... [t]he lawyer's professional judgment on behalf of the client will be or reasonably may be adversely affected\nby the lawyer's responsibilities to or interests in a third party or the lawyer's own financial, business, property, or personal\ninterests.”); MRPC 1 .7(b) (“A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited\nby the lawyer's responsibilities ... to a third person[ ] or by the lawyer's own interests unless ... the client has given knowing\nand informed consent after consultation.”).\n\nIn the UK Arbitration, Holmes and Fisher, on Munich Re's behalf, took the position that Munich Re did not owe compensation\nto NGC for certain losses related to Hurricane Katrina because the Navy had previously paid Defendants to compensate for\nthose losses. See United States' Consolidated Resp. to Relators' Ex Parte Motions 6–7[14]. However, at the same time he was\nrepresenting Munich Re in the UK Arbitration Holmes filed the Complaint [1] and First Amended Complaint [43], in which he\nalleged that the Navy should have never paid funds to Defendants and that it was Defendants' fraudulent conduct which duped\nthe Navy into paying the funds. Id. Holmes has not sufficiently disputed this characterization of the conflicting positions he\ntook as counsel for Munich Re, on the one hand, and as a relator in this case seeking over 2.5 billion dollars, 6 on the other.\nThese positions reflect a conflict between Holmes' personal interest as a relator, arguing that the Navy's payments to Northrop\nGrumman were invalid, and Holmes' interest as counsel to Munich Re, advocating the validity of those same payments to\nalleviate Munich Re's responsibilities to Northrop Grumman. Consequently, the record supports a finding that there was at\nleast “a significant risk” that Holmes' representation of Munich Re was “materially limited by” Holmes' “personal interest”\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\nin pursing this qui tam case, such that Holmes' conduct created a concurrent conflict of interest jeopardizing his obligation of\nloyalty to Munich Re. See ABA Model Rule 1.7(a).\n\n6      Holmes alleges that the United States was defrauded in the amount of “not less than $835 million” and “prays ... for treble that sum\n       or $2.505 billion” dollars. First Am. Compl. 23[43].\nFaced with this conflict, there is no evidence that Holmes obtained any kind of “informed consent” from Munich Re to\nsimultaneously represent Munich Re while prosecuting this qui tam action. See ABA Model Rule 1.7 (prohibiting concurrent\nconflicts of interest but making an exception where the attorney obtains affected clients' informed consent). “ ‘Informed consent’\ndenotes the agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and\nexplanation about the material risks of and reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of conduct.” ABA Model\nRules 1 .0(e); see also DCRPC 1.0(e) (same); MRPC, Terminology (“ ‘Informed consent’ denotes voluntary acceptance and\nagreement by a person of a proposed course of conduct after adequate information has been imparted to the person that allows\nthe person to arrive at a decision.”). The Comment to ABA Model Rule 1.0(e) notes that informed consent is often required\n“before ... pursuing a course of conduct.” Comment [6], ABA Model Rule 1.0 (citing ABA Model Rules 1.2(c), 1.6(a) and\n1.7(b)). The Comment also states\n\n             *7 [t]he lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the client or other person possesses\n            information reasonably adequate to make an informed decision. Ordinarily, this will require\n            communication that includes a disclosure of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the situation, any\n            explanation reasonably necessary to inform the client or other person of the material advantages and\n            disadvantages of the proposed course of conduct and a discussion of the client's or other person's options\n            and alternatives.\n\nComment [6], ABA Model Rule 1.0.\n\nThe record does not reveal facts supporting a finding that Holmes obtained Munich Re's informed consent at any point in time\nto engage in a course of conduct which created a concurrent conflict of interest between Holmes' duties to Munich Re and his\nown personal interests in this case. Holmes suggests that he obtained consent from Munich Re, but the timing of Munich Re's\n“consent” is questionable and there is no evidence the consent was “informed.” Specifically, Holmes contends\n\n            [the DOJ] directly asked the client, Munich Re, orally and in writing, specifically whether it had any\n            concerns about its counsel disclosing the information of the fraud to the DOJ. Munich Re specifically\n            responded in writing that it had no objection and did not participate in that decision, but respected\n            counsel's view of their obligations to disclose to [the] DOJ under U.S. law.\n\nResp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 9[156]. Holmes does not identify when he discussed his perceived\nlegal obligations with Munich Re, the content of those discussions, or whether Munich Re had the benefit of independent\ncounsel. See id.; see also Relators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ 10 [11, 12 of 86]; Holmes Aff. 6–7 [11, 41–42 of 86] (asserting\nthat Munich Re consented to Holmes' actions without any indication of what, if any, information was provided to Munich Re,\nwhen that information was provided, or on what basis Munich Re made its alleged decision to consent). Holmes thus has not\ndemonstrated facts supporting a finding that Holmes had Munich Re's informed consent to engage in conduct that involved a\nconcurrent conflict of interest, and as such, Holmes breached his duty of loyalty to his client, Munich Re, in order to bolster\nhis position in this case.\n\n\nc. Duty to Retain Confidentiality of Information\nThe ABA Model Rules, the MRPC, and the DCRPC each require attorneys to keep information relating to the representation\nof a client confidential. “A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client\ngives informed consent[ ]....” ABA Model Rule 1.6(a); see also MRPC 1.6(a) (same); DCRPC 1.6(a) (”[A] lawyer shall not\nknowingly: ... reveal a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client[,] ... use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client to the\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\ndisadvantage of the client[, or] ... use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client for the advantage of the lawyer or of a third\nperson....). 7\n\n7       Rule 1.6(b) of the DCRPC defines “confidence” and “secret” as follows: “ ‘Confidence’ refers to information protected by the\n        attorney-client privilege under applicable law, and ‘secret’ refers to other information gained in the professional relationship that\n        the client has requested be held inviolate, or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing, or would be likely to be detrimental,\n        to the client.”\n *8 Holmes has revealed and attempted to make personal use of information relating directly to his representation of Munich\nRe in the form of documents he obtained on Munich Re's behalf from the Navy and Northrop Grumman for use in the UK\nArbitration. Relators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ [11, 4 of 86] (“Relators have provided the Government with an extensive Disclosure\nMemorandum pointing out that the evidence of this fraud is based on documents available directly from the Navy, many of\nwhich Relators obtained pursuant to Touhy Regulation Requests in connection with ongoing litigation on an insurance claim.”).\nThese documents were subject to various confidentiality obligations existing between Munich Re, Northrop Grumman, and the\nNavy, and a Stipulated Protective Order imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See Ex. “1” to\nRelators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ [11, 56–66 of 86]; Stipulated Protective Order [20–1], Case No. 1:10–cv–551–JEB (D .D.C.).\nThere is no indication that Holmes would have otherwise come into possession of these documents but for his representation\nof Munich Re. Holmes acknowledged using these documents to pursue this qui tam action in which he seeks over 2.5 billion\ndollars, a portion of which would be available to him by virtue of his serving as relator. See, e.g., First Am. Compl. 9, 10, 23[43].\nAbsent Munich Re's informed consent, Holmes violated the duty to keep information related to his representation of Munich\nRe confidential when he revealed and made use of the documents he obtained during his representation of Munich Re. 8\n\n8       In addition, it is likely that Holmes' conduct violated Rule 4.4(a) of the ABA Model Rules. “In representing a client, a lawyer shall\n        not use ... methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of ... a [third] person.” ABA Model Rule 4.4(a); see also DCRPC\n        4.4(a) (same); MRPC 4.4(a) (same). In obtaining documents from Northrop Grumman and the Navy, Holmes, on behalf of Munich\n        Re, submitted to at least one agreement to keep documents Munich Re received from Northrop Grumman confidential and participated\n        in the creation and submission of the Stipulated Protective Order restricting the use and dissemination of documents received by\n        Munich Re from the Navy. Holmes' use of these documents for his own purposes in this qui tam action can reasonably be construed\n        as violating the legal rights of Northrop Grumman and the Navy.\nHolmes has not shown that he obtained Munich Re's informed consent prior to revealing and making use of confidential\ninformation he obtained as counsel for Munich Re. See ABA Model Rule 1.6 (prohibiting attorneys from revealing clients'\nconfidential information absent the client's informed consent). Holmes appears to acknowledge that Munich Re “did not\nparticipate in” his decision to disclose to the DOJ documents that he obtained on Munich Re's behalf and which fell within the\nscope of the various confidentiality obligations he owed Munich Re. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss\n9[156]; see also ABA Model Rule 1.6(a) (“A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless\nthe client gives informed consent [ ]....”); MRPC 1.6(a) (same); DCRPC 1.6(a) (“[A] lawyer shall not knowingly: ... reveal a\nconfidence or secret of the lawyer's client[,] ... use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client to the disadvantage of the client\n[, or] ... use a confidence or secret of the lawyer's client for the advantage of the lawyer or of a third person....”). Similar to\nhis actions surrounding the concurrent conflict of interest which jeopardized his duty of loyalty to Munich Re, Holmes has not\nsufficiently established that he obtained Munich Re's informed consent prior to revealing Munich Re's confidential information.\nConsequently, Holmes breached his duty to protect his client's confidential information.\n\n\nd. Holmes' Duty to Obey Court Orders\n *9 Perhaps the most serious of the ethical violations committed by Holmes is his having knowingly ignored his obligations\nunder the Stipulated Protective Order entered in the Touhy Action by the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia. “A lawyer shall not[ ] ... knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal\nbased on an assertion that no valid obligation exists....” ABA Model Rule 3 .4(c); see also DCRPC 3.4(c) (same); MRPC 3.4(c)\n(same). Holmes notes that the Stipulated Protective Order was first submitted as a proposed order and seems to argue that it\nshould not be treated as a court order. Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 10–11[156]. This argument\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                        7\n\fU.S. ex rel. Holmes v. Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\noverlooks the fact that Holmes jointly submitted the Stipulated Protective Order as a proposed order, and the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia specifically entered the Stipulated Protective Order “as an [O]rder of the Court....”\nOrder 1 [20–1], Case No. 1:10cv551–JEB (D.D.C .). Holmes was undoubtedly required to comply with the obligations imposed\nby the Stipulated Protective Order.\n\nThe Stipulated Protective Order provides that documents produced by the Navy “shall be used or disclosed solely in the UK\nArbitration” and “shall not be used in any other proceeding or for any other purpose without further order of this Court.” Id.\nat 6–7 [20–1, 9–10 of 13]. Holmes openly acknowledges that he violated the terms of the Stipulated Protective Order by his\nadmission that he disclosed documents subject to the Stipulated Protective Order to the DOJ and allowed his “expert team”\nto analyze such documents. 9 Relators' Mot. to Assist the DOJ 2, 10–12 [11, 4, 12–14 of 86]. If he had an objection to the\nNavy's designation of any information as being protected under the Stipulated Protective Order, the Stipulated Protective Order\nrequired Holmes to make an objection to the particular designations, but the record does not reveal that Holmes made any such\nobjections. Stipulated Protective Order 8 [20–1, 11 of 13], Case No. 1:10cv551–JEB (D.D.C.); see also Resp. in Opp'n to Defs.'\nMot. to Disqualify and Dismiss 6[156] (“With perfect 20/20 hindsight [,]” Holmes agrees that he “should have separately sought\n[the Court's] permission to use the documents” obtained in the Touhy Action and that doing so “would have been a good thing\nto do....”). Holmes was well aware of the terms of the Stipulated Protective Order, and requested that the District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia enter the Stipulated Protective Order, but knowingly violated the obligations imposed by that Order in\npursuit of his own interests in this qui tam action. Holmes' violation of the Stipulated Protective Order is yet another example\nof his unethical conduct surrounding his actions as a relator in this case.\n\n9      Prior cases indicate that one court generally should decline from evaluating whether a litigant before it has violated the order of\n       another court. See, e.g., In re Wright, No. Civ. A. 06–356, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">508050</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (E.D.La. Feb. 22, 2006) (“[I]t would be an\n       unwise policy for one court to determine whether a litigant violated another court's order.”) (citing In re Marriage of Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1791426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1791426/matter-of-marriage-of-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span>\n       <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755 (W.D.Tex.1982)). The Court, however, finds that this general principle is not implicated under the specific facts\n       of this case because Holmes has acknowledged repeatedly that he violated the Stipulated Protective Order and thus the Court need\n       not determine whether a violation has occurred. Moreover, the Court expressly limits its consideration of Holmes' violation of the\n       Stipulated Protective Order to being only one of several factors militating in favor of disqualifying Holmes from serving as a relator\n       in this case. Still, the seriousness of Holmes' violation of the Stipulated Protective Order should not be overlooked. See Holden v.\n       Simpson Paper Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. App'x</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31115137</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (5th Cir. Sept. 18, 2002) (“Deliberately disobeying court orders\n       demonstrates sufficient bad faith to justify a district court's sanction under its inherent powers.”).\n\n\n3. The Totality of Holmes' Ethical Violations Require His Disqualification as Relator\n *10 When viewed in its entirety, Holmes' conduct reveals multiple improprieties. See U.S. Fire, 50 F.3d at 1314 (noting that\ncourts adjudicating a motion to disqualify should consider, in addition to relevant ethical precepts, the impropriety of counsel's\nconduct and the extent to which public suspicion of that conduct outweighs any social interests served by allowing counsel\nto continue participating) (quoting Dresser, 972 F.2d at 544) (internal marks omitted). Holmes' conduct did not merely bear\nthe appearance of impropriety but was in fact improper. Holmes violated his duty of loyalty to Munich Re by simultaneously\nadvocating a position for Munich Re that was completely contrary to the position he continues to advocate as relator in this\ncase. Holmes violated his duty to retain confidential information by allowing his own interest in pursing this qui tam action to\noverride his duties to Munich Re related to the confidentiality of documents he obtained on Munich Re's behalf, which placed\nMunich Re in jeopardy of violating various confidentiality obligations to which Holmes knew his client was bound. In seeking\nto build support for his qui tam case, Holmes also knowingly violated the Stipulated Protective Order issued by the court in the\nTouhy Action. All the while, Holmes violated his duty of candor by failing to apprise the court in the Touhy Action or counsel\nfor NGC in the UK Arbitration of his motives for obtaining the confidential information.\n\nThe accompanying public suspicion arising from Holmes' conduct outweighs any social interest in permitting him to continue\nparticipating as a relator. See U.S. Fire, 50 F.3d at 1314 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting Dresser, 972 F.2d at 544). The potential for\npublic suspicion stemming from this conduct is exemplified by the DOJ's concerns that Holmes' conduct gave rise to “serious\nethical and professional responsibility concerns....” United States' Consolidated Resp. to Relators' Ex Parte Motions 6[14].\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Northrop Grumman Corp., Slip Copy (2015)\n\n\nFurthermore, in considering Holmes' disqualification, the Court is not faced with the prospect of disqualifying an innocent\nparty's chosen counsel. Rather, disqualifying Holmes only precludes him from receiving the benefits which may otherwise be\navailable to him personally as a relator, such that the social interests in allowing him to continue participating in this case are\nminimal. The Court finds that based on the totality of the ethical violations committed by Holmes surrounding this qui tam\ncase, Holmes should be disqualified from serving as relator in this case.\n\n\n4. Dismissal of the First Amended Complaint\nIn determining whether dismissal of the First Amended Complaint [43] is warranted, the pertinent inquiry is the extent to which\nNorthrop Grumman stands to suffer prejudice if the action were to proceed to trial. See Quest Diagnostics, 734 F.3d at 166–67\n(affirming district court's decision to disqualify relators and dismiss their qui tam complaint due to the fact that allowing the\ncase to proceed “would taint the trial proceedings and prejudice defendants”). Here, the Court finds that merely disqualifying\nHolmes from serving as relator without dismissing the case would greatly prejudice Northrop Grumman because the case would\nbe tried on a record developed primarily through the fruits of Holmes' unethical conduct. In addition, the fact that the United\nStates government rather than Holmes is the real party in interest further supports dismissing Holmes' First Amended Complaint\n[43]. See United States ex rel. Williams v. Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"38587\"><a href=\"/opinion/38587/williams-v-bell-helicopter/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 (5th Cir.2005). Namely, as the real\nparty in interest, the government would not be prevented from bringing these or similar claims against Northrop Grumman. See\nQuest Diagnostics, 734 F.3d at 167 (noting that dismissal of the disqualified relators' complaint was further justified by the fact\nthat neither the United States, as the real party in interest, nor any other relator was foreclosed from bringing the claims). The\nCourt thus finds that the First Amended Complaint [43] should be dismissed with prejudice as to Holmes but without prejudice\nas to any rights of the United States. 10\n\n10     The Fifth Circuit has found that dismissal of a relator's complaint should not necessarily operate as a dismissal with prejudice\n       against the United States merely because it opted not to intervene. Williams, 417 F.3d at 454–55 (finding that dismissal of a relator's\n       complaint for failure to comply with Rule 9(b) did not operate as a dismissal with prejudice against the government simply because\n       the government did not intervene). This is because the FCA “does not require the government to proceed if its investigation [of\n       allegations in a qui tam complaint] yields a meritorious claim.” Id. at 455.\n\n\n\n                                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n *11 Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Donald Holmes should be disqualified from serving as a relator in this\nqui tam case, and that this civil action should be dismissed with prejudice as to Holmes, but without prejudice to any rights\npossessed by the United States government.\n\nIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion to Disqualify Relator and Dismiss the First Amended\nComplaint [151] filed by Defendants Northrop Grumman Corporation and Huntington Ingalls Incorporated is GRANTED.\n\nIT IS, FURTHER, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Donald Holmes is DISQUALIFIED from serving as a relator in\nthis qui tam case.\n\nIT IS, FURTHER, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that this case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as to Donald Holmes,\nbut WITHOUT PREJUDICE as to any rights of the United States government.\n\nIT IS, FURTHER, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [102] filed by Defendants\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation and Huntington Ingalls Incorporated is DENIED AS MOOT.\n\nSO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\nVermont Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nHeld: Federal law does not pre-empt Levine's claim that Phenergan's label did not contain an adequate warning about the IV-\npush method of administration. Pp. 1193 – 1204.\n\n(a) The argument that Levine's state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for Wyeth to comply with both the state-\nlaw duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties is rejected. Although a manufacturer generally may change\na drug label only after the FDA approves a supplemental application, the agency's “changes being effected” (CBE) regulation\npermits certain preapproval labeling changes that add or strengthen a warning to improve drug safety. Pursuant to the CBE\nregulation, Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration, and there is no evidence that\nthe FDA would ultimately have rejected such a labeling change. Wyeth's cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad\nassertion that unilaterally changing the Phenergan label would have violated federal law governing unauthorized distribution\nand misbranding of drugs are based on the fundamental misunderstanding that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears\nprimary responsibility for drug labeling. It is a central premise of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the\nFDA's regulations that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times. Pp. 1196 – 1199.\n\n **1190 *556 (b) Wyeth's argument that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning would\ninterfere with Congress' purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions is meritless because it relies on an\nuntenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency's power to pre-empt state law. The history\nof the FDCA shows that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions. In advancing the argument\nthat the FDA must be presumed to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law\njudgments, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress but on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-\nlaw failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDA's statutorily prescribed role. Although an agency regulation with the force of law\ncan pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agency's assertion that state law\nis an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives. Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt\nstate law directly, the weight this Court accords the agency's explanation of state law's impact on the federal scheme depends on\nits thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness. Cf., e.g.,Skidmore v. Swift & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nUnder this standard, the FDA's 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDA's failure to\noffer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence\nof Congress' purposes; and it reverses the FDA's own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug\nregulation without providing a reasoned explanation.

A\nVermont **1191 jury found that petitioner Wyeth, the manufacturer of the drug, had failed to provide an adequate warning of\nthat risk and awarded damages to respondent Diana Levine to compensate her for the amputation of her arm. The warnings on\nPhenergan's label had been deemed sufficient by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when it approved Wyeth's\nnew drug application in 1955 and when it later approved changes in the drug's labeling. The question we must decide is whether\nthe FDA's approvals provide *559 Wyeth with a complete defense to Levine's tort claims. We conclude that they do not.\n\n\n\n                                                                     I\n\nPhenergan is Wyeth's brand name for promethazine hydrochloride, an antihistamine used to treat nausea. The injectable form\nof Phenergan can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and it can be administered intravenously through either\nthe “IV-push” method, whereby the drug is injected directly into a patient's vein, or the “IV-drip” method, whereby the drug\nis introduced into a saline solution in a hanging intravenous bag and slowly descends through a catheter inserted in a patient's\nvein. The drug is corrosive and causes irreversible gangrene if it enters a patient's artery.\n\nLevine's injury resulted from an IV-push injection of Phenergan. On April 7, 2000, as on previous visits to her local clinic\nfor treatment of a migraine headache, she received an intramuscular injection of Demerol for her headache and Phenergan for\nher nausea. Because the combination did not provide relief, she returned later that day and received a second injection of both\ndrugs. This time, the physician assistant administered the drugs by the IV-push method, and Phenergan entered Levine's artery,\neither because the needle penetrated an artery directly or because the drug escaped from the vein into surrounding tissue (a\nphenomenon called “perivascular extravasation”) where it came in contact with arterial blood. As a result, Levine developed\ngangrene, and doctors amputated first her right hand and then her entire forearm. In addition to her pain and suffering, Levine\nincurred substantial medical expenses and the loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.\n\nAfter settling claims against the health center and clinician, Levine brought an action for damages against Wyeth, relying on\ncommon-law negligence and strict-liability theories. Although Phenergan's labeling warned of the danger of gangrene and\namputation following inadvertent intra-arterial *560 injection, 1 Levine alleged that **1192 the labeling was defective\nbecause it failed to instruct clinicians to use the IV-drip method of intravenous administration instead of the higher risk IV-push\nmethod. More broadly, she alleged that Phenergan is not reasonably safe for intravenous administration because the foreseeable\nrisks of gangrene and loss of limb are great in relation to the drug's therapeutic benefits. App. 14–15.\n\n1      The warning for “Inadvertent Intra-arterial Injection” stated: “Due to the close proximity of arteries and veins in the areas most\n       commonly used for intravenous injection, extreme care should be exercised to avoid perivascular extravasation or inadvertent intra-\n       arterial injection. Reports compatible with inadvertent intra-arterial injection of Phenergan Injection, usually in conjunction with\n       other drugs intended for intravenous use, suggest that pain, severe chemical irritation, severe spasm of distal vessels, and resultant\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Intravenous injection was intended in all the cases reported but\n        perivascular extravasation or arterial placement of the needle is now suspect. There is no proven successful management of this\n        condition after it occurs.... Aspiration of dark blood does not preclude intra-arterial needle placement, because blood is discolored\n        upon contact with Phenergan Injection. Use of syringes with rigid plungers or of small bore needles might obscure typical arterial\n        backflow if this is relied upon alone. When used intravenously, Phenergan Injection should be given in a concentration no greater\n        than 25 mg per mL and at a rate not to exceed 25 mg per minute. When administering any irritant drug intravenously, it is usually\n        preferable to inject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily. In the event that a\n        patient complains of pain during intended intravenous injection of Phenergan Injection, the injection should be stopped immediately\n        to provide for evaluation of possible arterial placement or perivascular extravasation.” App. 390.\nWyeth filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Levine's failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by federal law. The\ncourt found no merit in either Wyeth's field pre-emption argument, which it has since abandoned, or its conflict pre-emption\nargument. With respect to the contention that there was an “actual conflict between a specific FDA order,”id., at 21, and Levine's\nfailure-to-warn action, the *561 court reviewed the sparse correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA about Phenergan's\nlabeling and found no evidence that Wyeth had “earnestly attempted” to strengthen the intra-arterial injection warning or that\nthe FDA had “specifically disallowed” stronger language, id., at 23. The record, as then developed, “lack[ed] any evidence that\nthe FDA set a ceiling on this matter.” Ibid.\n\nThe evidence presented during the 5–day jury trial showed that the risk of intra-arterial injection or perivascular extravasation\ncan be almost entirely eliminated through the use of IV-drip, rather than IV-push, administration. An IV drip is started with\nsaline, which will not flow properly if the catheter is not in the vein and fluid is entering an artery or surrounding tissue. See\nid., at 50–51, 60, 66–68, 75. By contrast, even a careful and experienced clinician using the IV-push method will occasionally\nexpose an artery to Phenergan. See id., at 73, 75–76. While Phenergan's labeling warned against intra-arterial injection and\nperivascular extravasation and advised that “[w]hen administering any irritant drug intravenously it is usually preferable to\ninject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily,” id., at 390, the labeling\ndid not contain a specific warning about the risks of IV-push administration.\n\nThe trial record also contains correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA discussing Phenergan's label. The FDA first\napproved injectable Phenergan in 1955. In 1973 and 1976, Wyeth submitted supplemental new drug applications, which the\nagency approved after proposing labeling changes. Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application in 1981 in response to a\nnew FDA rule governing drug labels. Over the next 17 years, Wyeth and the FDA intermittently corresponded about Phenergan's\nlabel. The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure,\nand in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the *562 proposed changes. The FDA did not respond.\nInstead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth's 1988 submission, instructed\nit to “[r]etain verbiage in current label” regarding intra-arterial injection. Id., at 359. After a few further changes to the labeling\nnot related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA approved Wyeth's 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan's final\nprinted label “must be identical” to the approved package insert. Id., at 382.\n\nBased on this regulatory history, the trial judge instructed the jury that it could **1193 consider evidence of Wyeth's\ncompliance with FDA requirements but that such compliance did not establish that the warnings were adequate. He also\ninstructed, without objection from Wyeth, that FDA regulations “permit a drug manufacturer to change a product label to add\nor strengthen a warning about its product without prior FDA approval so long as it later submits the revised warning for review\nand approval.” Id., at 228.\n\nAnswering questions on a special verdict form, the jury found that Wyeth was negligent, that Phenergan was a defective product\nas a result of inadequate warnings and instructions, and that no intervening cause had broken the causal connection between\nthe product defects and the plaintiff's injury. Id., at 233–235. It awarded total damages of $7,400,000, which the court reduced\nto account for Levine's earlier settlement with the health center and clinician.Id., at 235–236.\n\nOn August 3, 2004, the trial court filed a comprehensive opinion denying Wyeth's motion for judgment as a matter of law. After\nmaking findings of fact based on the trial record (supplemented by one letter that Wyeth found after the trial), the court rejected\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It determined that there was no direct conflict between FDA regulations and Levine's state-\nlaw claims because those regulations permit strengthened warnings without FDA approval on an interim basis and the record\ncontained evidence *563 of at least 20 reports of amputations similar to Levine's since the 1960's. The court also found that\nstate tort liability in this case would not obstruct the FDA's work because the agency had paid no more than passing attention\nto the question whether to warn against IV-push administration of Phenergan. In addition, the court noted that state law serves\na compensatory function distinct from federal regulation. Id., at 249–252.\n\nThe Vermont Supreme Court affirmed. It held that the jury's verdict “did not conflict with FDA's labeling requirements for\nPhenergan because [Wyeth] could have warned against IV-push administration without prior FDA approval, and because\nfederal labeling requirements create a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1941660\"><a href=\"/opinion/1941660/levine-v-wyeth/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184 (2006).

As a preface to our evaluation of these arguments, we identify two\nfactual propositions decided during the trial court proceedings, emphasize two legal principles that guide our analysis, and\nreview the history of the controlling federal statute.\n\nThe trial court proceedings established that Levine's injury would not have occurred if Phenergan's label had included an\nadequate warning about the risks of the IV-push method of administering the drug. The record contains evidence that the\nphysician assistant administered a greater dose than the label prescribed, that she may have inadvertently injected the drug\ninto an artery rather than a vein, and that she continued to inject the drug after Levine complained of pain. Nevertheless, the\njury rejected Wyeth's argument that the clinician's conduct was an intervening cause that absolved it of liability. See App. 234\n(jury verdict), 252–254. In finding Wyeth negligent as well as strictly liable, the jury also determined that Levine's injury was\nforeseeable. That the inadequate label was both a but-for and proximate cause of Levine's injury is supported by the record\nand no longer challenged by Wyeth. 2\n\n2      The dissent nonetheless suggests that physician malpractice was the exclusive cause of Levine's injury. See, e.g., post, at 1217\n       (opinion of ALITO, J.) (“[I]t is unclear how a ‘stronger’ warning could have helped respondent”); post, at 1225 – 1227 (suggesting\n       that the physician assistant's conduct was the sole cause of the injury). The dissent's frustration with the jury's verdict does not put\n       the merits of Levine's tort claim before us, nor does it change the question we must decide—whether federal law pre-empts Levine's\n       state-law claims.\nThe trial court proceedings further established that the critical defect in Phenergan's label was the lack of an adequate\nwarning about the risks of IV-push administration. Levine also offered evidence that the IV-push method should *565 be\ncontraindicated and that Phenergan should never be administered intravenously, even by the IV-drip method. Perhaps for this\nreason, the dissent incorrectly assumes that the state-law duty at issue is the duty to contraindicate the IV-push method. See, e.g.,\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

But, as the Vermont Supreme Court explained, the jury verdict established only that Phenergan's\nwarning was insufficient. It did not mandate a particular replacement warning, nor did it require contraindicating IV-push\nadministration: “There may have been any number of ways for [Wyeth] to strengthen the Phenergan warning without completely\neliminating IV-push administration.” 183 Vt., at ––––, n. 2, 944 A.2d, at 189, n. 2. We therefore need not decide whether a\nstate rule proscribing intravenous administration would be pre-empted. The narrower question presented is whether federal\nlaw pre-empts Levine's claim that Phenergan's label did not contain an adequate warning about using the IV-push method of\nadministration.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] Our answer to that question must be guided by two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence.

In 1906, Congress enacted its first significant public health law, the Federal Food and Drugs Act, ch. 3915, 34\nStat. 768. The Act, which prohibited the manufacture or interstate shipment of adulterated or misbranded drugs, supplemented\nthe protection for consumers already provided by state regulation and common-law liability. In the 1930's, Congress became\nincreasingly concerned about unsafe drugs and fraudulent marketing, and it enacted the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n(FDCA), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq. The Act's most substantial innovation was its provision\nfor premarket approval of new drugs. It required every manufacturer to submit a new drug application, including reports of\ninvestigations and specimens of proposed labeling, to the FDA for review. Until its application became effective, a manufacturer\nwas prohibited from distributing a drug. The FDA could reject an application if it determined that the drug was not safe for\nuse as labeled, though if the agency failed to act, an application became effective 60 days after the filing. FDCA, § 505(c),\n52 Stat. 1052.\n\n *567 In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA and shifted the burden of proof from the FDA to the manufacturer. Before 1962,\nthe agency had to prove harm to keep a drug out of the market, but the amendments required the manufacturer to demonstrate\nthat its drug was “safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling” before it\ncould distribute the drug. §§ 102(d), 104(b), 76 Stat. 781, 784. In addition, the amendments required the manufacturer to prove\nthe drug's effectiveness by introducing “substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to\nhave under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.” § 102(d), id., at 781.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See 21 U.S.C.\n§ 355; 21 CFR § 314.105(b) (2008). Generally speaking, a manufacturer may only change a drug label after the FDA approves\na supplemental application. There is, however, an FDA regulation that permits a manufacturer to make certain changes to its\nlabel before receiving the agency's approval. Among other things, this “changes being effected” (CBE) regulation provides that\nif a manufacturer is changing a label to “add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction” or to\n“add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,”\nit may make the labeling change upon filing its supplemental application with the FDA; it need not wait for FDA approval.\n§§ 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), (C).\n\nWyeth argues that the CBE regulation is not implicated in this case because a 2008 amendment provides that a manufacturer\nmay only change its label “to reflect newly acquired information.” 73 Fed.Reg. 49609. Resting on this language (which Wyeth\nargues simply reaffirmed the interpretation of the regulation in effect when this case was tried), Wyeth contends that it could\nhave changed Phenergan's label only in response to new information that the FDA had not considered. And it maintains that\nLevine has not pointed to any such information concerning the risks of IV-push administration. Thus, Wyeth insists, it was\nimpossible for it *569 to discharge its state-law obligation to provide a stronger warning about IV-push administration without\nviolating federal law. Wyeth's argument misapprehends both the federal drug regulatory scheme and its burden in establishing\na pre-emption defense.\n\nWe need not decide whether the 2008 CBE regulation is consistent with the FDCA and the previous version of the **1197\nregulation, as Wyeth and the United States urge, because Wyeth could have revised Phenergan's label even in accordance with\nthe amended regulation. As the FDA explained in its notice of the final rule, “ ‘newly acquired information’ ” is not limited\nto new data, but also encompasses “new analyses of previously submitted data.” Id., at 49604. The rule accounts for the fact\nthat risk information accumulates over time and that the same data may take on a different meaning in light of subsequent\ndevelopments: “[I]f the sponsor submits adverse event information to FDA, and then later conducts a new analysis of data\nshowing risks of a different type or of greater severity or frequency than did reports previously submitted to FDA, the sponsor\nmeets the requirement for ‘newly acquired information.’ ” Id., at 49607; see also id., at 49606.\n\nThe record is limited concerning what newly acquired information Wyeth had or should have had about the risks of IV-push\nadministration of Phenergan because Wyeth did not argue before the trial court that such information was required for a CBE\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Levine did, however, present evidence of at least 20 incidents prior to her injury in which a Phenergan injection\nresulted in gangrene and an amputation. See App. 74, 252. 4 After the first such incident came to Wyeth's attention in 1967,\nit notified the FDA and worked with the agency to change Phenergan's label. *570 In later years, as amputations continued\nto occur, Wyeth could have analyzed the accumulating data and added a stronger warning about IV-push administration of\nthe drug.\n\n4      Levine also introduced evidence that Pfizer had withdrawn Vistaril, another antinausea drug, from intravenous use several decades\n       earlier because its intravenous injection had resulted in gangrene and amputations. See App. 79.\nWyeth argues that if it had unilaterally added such a warning, it would have violated federal law governing unauthorized\ndistribution and misbranding. Its argument that a change in Phenergan's labeling would have subjected it to liability for\nunauthorized distribution rests on the assumption that this labeling change would have rendered Phenergan a new drug lacking\nan effective application. But strengthening the warning about IV-push administration would not have made Phenergan a new\ndrug. See 21 U.S.C. § 321(p)(1) (defining “new drug”); 21 CFR § 310.3(h). Nor would this warning have rendered Phenergan\nmisbranded. The FDCA does not provide that a drug is misbranded simply because the manufacturer has altered an FDA-\napproved label; instead, the misbranding provision focuses on the substance of the label and, among other things, proscribes\nlabels that fail to include “adequate warnings.” 21 U.S.C. § 352(f). Moreover, because the statute contemplates that federal\njuries will resolve most misbranding claims, the FDA's belief that a drug is misbranded is not conclusive. See §§ 331, 332,\n334(a)-(b). And the very idea that the FDA would bring an enforcement action against a manufacturer for strengthening a\nwarning pursuant to the CBE regulation is difficult to accept—neither Wyeth nor the United States has identified a case in\nwhich the FDA has done so.\n\n [6] Wyeth's cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad reading of the FDCA's misbranding and unauthorized\ndistribution provisions are premised on a more fundamental misunderstanding. Wyeth suggests that the FDA, rather than\nthe manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling. Yet through many amendments to the FDCA and to FDA\nregulations, it has remained a central premise of federal drug regulation that the **1198 manufacturer bears responsibility\n *571 for the content of its label at all times. It is charged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings\nremain adequate as long as the drug is on the market. See, e.g., 21 CFR § 201.80(e) (requiring a manufacturer to revise its label\n“to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug”); § 314.80(b)\n(placing responsibility for postmarketing surveillance on the manufacturer); 73 Fed.Reg. 49605 (“Manufacturers continue to\nhave a responsibility under Federal law ... to maintain their labeling and update the labeling with new safety information”).\n\nIndeed, prior to 2007, the FDA lacked the authority to order manufacturers to revise their labels. See 121 Stat. 924–926. When\nCongress granted the FDA this authority, it reaffirmed the manufacturer's obligations and referred specifically to the CBE\nregulation, which both reflects the manufacturer's ultimate responsibility for its label and provides a mechanism for adding\nsafety information to the label prior to FDA approval. See id., at 925–926 (stating that a manufacturer retains the responsibility\n“to maintain its label in accordance with existing requirements, including subpart B of part 201 and sections 314.70 and 601.12\nof title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations)” (emphasis added)). Thus, when the risk of gangrene\nfrom IV-push injection of Phenergan became apparent, Wyeth had a duty to provide a warning that adequately described that\nrisk, and the CBE regulation permitted it to provide such a warning before receiving the FDA's approval.\n\nOf course, the FDA retains authority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation in its review of the\nmanufacturer's supplemental application, just as it retains such authority in reviewing all supplemental applications. But absent\nclear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to Phenergan's label, we will not conclude that it was impossible\nfor Wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements.\n\n*572 Wyeth has offered no such evidence. It does not argue that it attempted to give the kind of warning required by the\nVermont jury but was prohibited from doing so by the FDA. 5 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12–13; see also Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 25.

In its decision on Wyeth's motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, **1199 the trial court found “no evidence in this record that either the FDA or the manufacturer\ngave more than passing attention to the issue of” IV-push versus IV-drip administration. App. 249. The Vermont Supreme Court\nlikewise concluded that the FDA had not made an affirmative decision to preserve the IV-push method or intended to prohibit\nWyeth from strengthening its warning about IV-push administration. 183 Vt., at ––––, 944 A.2d, at 188–189. Moreover, Wyeth\ndoes not argue that it supplied the FDA with an evaluation *573 or analysis concerning the specific dangers posed by the IV-\npush method. We accordingly cannot credit Wyeth's contention that the FDA would have prevented it from adding a stronger\nwarning about the IV-push method of intravenous administration. 6\n\n5      The record would not, in any event, support such an argument. In 1988, Wyeth did propose different language for Phenergan's\n       warning about intra-arterial injection, adapted from revisions the FDA proposed in 1987. See App. 339–341, 311–312. When the\n       FDA approved Wyeth's application, it instructed Wyeth to retain the wording in its current label. During the trial court proceedings,\n       Levine indicated that the language proposed in 1988 would have more strongly warned against IV-push administration. But the trial\n       court and the Vermont Supreme Court found that the 1988 warning did not differ in any material respect from the FDA-approved\n       warning.

But even the dissent's account does not support\n       the conclusion that the FDA would have prohibited Wyeth from adding a stronger warning pursuant to the CBE regulation.\nImpossibility pre-emption is a demanding defense. On the record before us, Wyeth has failed to demonstrate that it was\nimpossible for it to comply with both federal and state requirements. The CBE regulation permitted Wyeth to unilaterally\nstrengthen its warning, and the mere fact that the FDA approved Phenergan's label does not establish that it would have\nprohibited such a change.\n\n\n\n                                                                   IV\n\n [7] Wyeth also argues that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning about IV-push\nadministration would obstruct the purposes and objectives of federal drug labeling regulation. Levine's tort claims, it maintains,\nare pre-empted because they interfere with “Congress's purpose to entrust an expert agency to make drug labeling decisions\nthat strike a balance between competing objectives.” Brief for Petitioner 46. We find no merit in this argument, which relies on\nan untenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency's power to pre-empt state law.\n\nWyeth contends that the FDCA establishes both a floor and a ceiling for drug regulation: Once the FDA has approved *574\na drug's label, a state-law verdict may not deem the label inadequate, regardless of whether there is any evidence that the FDA\nhas considered the stronger warning at issue. The most glaring problem with this argument is that all evidence of Congress'\npurposes is to the contrary. Building on its 1906 Act, Congress enacted the FDCA to bolster consumer protection against harmful\nproducts. See Kordel v.

But despite its 1976 enactment of an express pre-emption provision\nfor medical devices, see § 521, 90 Stat. 574 (codified at 21 U.S.C. § 360k(a)), Congress has not enacted such a provision for\nprescription drugs.

As Justice O'Connor\nexplained in her opinion for a unanimous Court: “The case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has\nindicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both\nconcepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v.

See 21 U.S.C. §§ 379r(e), 379s(d) (“Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or\n       otherwise affect any action or the liability of any person under the product liability law of any State”).\n [9] Despite this evidence that Congress did not regard state tort litigation as an obstacle to achieving its purposes, Wyeth\nnonetheless maintains that, because the FDCA requires the FDA to determine that a drug is safe and effective under the\nconditions set forth in its labeling, the agency must be presumed to have performed a precise balancing of risks and benefits\nand to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments. In advancing this\nargument, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress, but instead on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation governing the\ncontent and format of prescription drug labels. See Brief for Petitioner 8, 11, 42, 45, and 50 (citing 71 Fed.Reg. 3922 (2006)). In\nthat preamble, the FDA declared that the FDCA establishes “both a ‘floor’ and a ‘ceiling,’ ” so that “FDA approval of labeling ...\npreempts conflicting or contrary State law.” Id., at 3934–3935. It further stated that certain state-law actions, such as those\ninvolving failure-to-warn claims, “threaten FDA's statutorily *576 prescribed role as the expert Federal agency responsible\nfor evaluating and regulating drugs.” Id., at 3935.\n\nThis Court has recognized that an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements.

When the FDA issued its notice of proposed rulemaking\nin December 2000, it explained that the rule would “not contain policies that have federalism implications or that preempt State\nlaw.” 65 Fed.Reg. 81103; see also 71 id., at 3969 (noting that the “proposed rule did not propose to preempt state law”). In\n2006, the agency finalized the rule and, without offering States or other interested parties notice or opportunity for comment,\narticulated a sweeping position on the FDCA's pre-emptive effect in the regulatory preamble. The agency's views on state law\nare inherently suspect in light of this procedural failure.\n\nFurther, the preamble is at odds with what evidence we have of Congress' purposes, and it reverses the FDA's own longstanding\nposition without providing a reasoned explanation, including any discussion of how state law has interfered with the FDA's\nregulation of drug labeling during decades of coexistence. The FDA's 2006 position plainly does not reflect the agency's own\nview at all times relevant to this litigation. Not once prior to Levine's injury **1202 did the FDA suggest that state tort law\nstood as an obstacle to its statutory mission. To the contrary, it cast federal labeling standards as a floor upon which States could\nbuild and repeatedly disclaimed *578 any attempt to pre-empt failure-to-warn claims. For instance, in 1998, the FDA stated\nthat it did “not believe that the evolution of state tort law [would] cause the development of standards that would be at odds\nwith the agency's regulations.” 63 id., at 66384. It further noted that, in establishing “ minimal standards” for drug labels, it did\nnot intend “to preclude the states from imposing additional labeling requirements.” Ibid. 10\n\n10     See also 44 Fed.Reg. 37437 (1979) (“It is not the intent of the FDA to influence the civil tort liability of the manufacturer”);\n       59 Fed.Reg. 3948 (1994) (“[P]roduct liability plays an important role in consumer protection”); Porter, The LohrDecision: FDA\n       Perspective and Position, 52 Food & Drug L.J. 7, 10 (1997) (former chief counsel to the FDA stating that the FDA regarded state\n       law as complementing the agency's mission of consumer protection).\nIn keeping with Congress' decision not to pre-empt common-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA traditionally regarded state\nlaw as a complementary form of drug regulation. The FDA has limited resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market, 11\nand manufacturers have superior access *579 to information about their drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new\nrisks emerge. State tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety\nrisks promptly. They also serve a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured persons to come forward with\ninformation. Failure-to-warn actions, in particular, lend force to the FDCA's premise that manufacturers, not the FDA, bear\nprimary responsibility for their drug labeling at all times. Thus, the FDA long maintained that state law offers an additional, and\nimportant, layer of consumer protection that complements FDA regulation. **1203 12 The agency's 2006 preamble represents\na dramatic change in position.\n\n11     In 1955, the same year that the agency approved Wyeth's Phenergan application, an FDA advisory committee issued a report\n       finding “conclusively” that “the budget and staff of the Food and Drug Administration are inadequate to permit the discharge of\n       its existing responsibilities for the protection of the American public.” Citizens Advisory Committee on the FDA, Report to the\n       Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, H.R.

There, we held that state tort claims premised on Honda's failure to install airbags conflicted with a\nfederal regulation that did not require airbags for all cars. The Department of Transportation *580 (DOT) had promulgated a\nrule that provided car manufacturers with a range of choices among passive restraint devices.

In Geier, the DOT conducted a formal rulemaking and then adopted a plan to phase in a mix of passive restraint\ndevices. Examining the rule itself and the DOT's contemporaneous record, which revealed the factors the agency had weighed\nand the balance it had struck, we determined that state tort suits presented an obstacle to the federal scheme. After conducting\nour own pre-emption analysis, we considered the agency's explanation of how state law interfered with its regulation, regarding\nit as further support for our independent conclusion that the plaintiff's tort claim obstructed the federal regime.\n\nBy contrast, we have no occasion in this case to consider the pre-emptive effect of a specific agency regulation bearing the\nforce of law. And the FDA's newfound opinion, expressed in its 2006 preamble, that state law “frustrate[s] the agency's\nimplementation of its statutory mandate,” 71 Fed.Reg. 3934, does not merit deference for the reasons we have explained. 13\nIndeed, the “complex and extensive” regulatory *581 history and background relevant to this case, Geier, 529 U.S., at 883,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118371\"><a href=\"/opinion/118371/geier-v-american-honda-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Congress has repeatedly declined to pre-empt state law, and the FDA's recently adopted position that state tort suits\ninterfere with its statutory mandate is entitled to no weight.

State tort law will sometimes help the *582 Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) “uncover unknown drug hazards and [encourage] drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks.”\nAnte, at 1202. But it is also possible that state tort law will sometimes interfere with the FDA's desire to create a drug label\ncontaining a specific set of cautions and instructions. I also note that some have argued that state tort law can sometimes raise\nprices to the point where those who are sick are unable to obtain the drugs they need. See Lasagna, The Chilling Effect of Product\nLiability on New Drug Development, in The Liability Maze 334, 335–336 (P. Huber & R. Litan eds.1991).

I agree with the Court, however,\nthat such a regulation is not at issue in this case.\n\n\nJustice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.\nI agree with the Court that the fact that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the label for petitioner Wyeth's\ndrug Phenergan does not pre-empt the state-law judgment before the Court. That judgment was based on a jury finding that the\nlabel did not adequately warn of the risk involved in administering Phenergan through the IV-push injection method. Under\nfederal law, without prior approval from the FDA, Wyeth could have “add[ed] or strengthen[ed]” information on its label about\n“a contraindication, *583 warning, precaution, or adverse reaction,” **1205 21 CFR § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A) (2008), or “about\ndosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,” § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to\n“reflect newly acquired information,” including “new analyses of previously submitted data,” about the dangers of IV-push\nadministration of Phenergan, 73 Fed.Reg. 49603, 49609 (2008). It thus was possible for Wyeth to label and market Phenergan in\ncompliance with federal law while also providing additional warning information on its label beyond that previously approved\nby the FDA.

There could be instances where it is not “physically\nimpossible” to comply with both state and federal law, even when the state and federal laws give directly conflicting commands.\nSee Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L.Rev. 225, 260–261 (2000). For example, if federal law gives an individual the right to\nengage in certain behavior that state law prohibits, the laws would give contradictory commands notwithstanding the fact that\nan individual could comply with both by electing to refrain from the covered behavior. Ibid. Therefore, “physical impossibility”\nmay not be the most appropriate standard for determining whether the text of state and federal laws directly conflict. See ibid.\n(concluding that the Supremacy Clause does not limit direct conflicts to cases with “physically impossible” conflicts and arguing\nthat evidence from the Founding supports a standard of “logical-contradiction”); see also AT & T, supra, at 227, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118229\"><a href=\"/opinion/118229/american-telephone-telegraph-co-v-central-office-telephone-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The “changes being effected” regulation allows drug manufacturers to change their labels without the\nFDA's preapproval if the changes “add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse **1210 reaction,” §\n314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), or “add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe\nuse of the drug product,” § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to “reflect newly acquired information,” including “new analyses of\npreviously submitted data,” 73 Fed.Reg. 49603, 49609. Under the terms of these regulations, after learning of new incidences\nof gangrene-induced amputation resulting from the IV-push administration of Phenergan, see ante, at 1196 – 1197, federal law\ngave Wyeth the authority to change Phenergan's label to “strengthen a ... warning,” “strengthen a ... precaution,” § 314.70(c)\n(6)(iii)(A), or to “strengthen an instruction about ... administration [of the IV-push method] ... to increase the safe use of the\ndrug product,” § 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C). Thus, it was physically possible for Wyeth to comply with a state-law requirement to\nprovide stronger warnings on Phenergan about the risks of the IV-push administration method *592 while continuing to market\nPhenergan in compliance with federal law.\n\nIn addition, the text of the statutory provisions governing FDA drug labeling, and the regulations promulgated thereunder,\ndo not give drug manufacturers an unconditional right to market their federally approved drug at all times with the precise\nlabel initially approved by the FDA. Thus, there is no “direct conflict” between the federal labeling law and the state-court\njudgment.

Initial approval of a label amounts to a finding by the FDA that the label is safe for purposes of gaining\nfederal approval to market the drug. It does not represent a finding that the drug, as labeled, can never be deemed unsafe by\nlater federal action, or as in this case, the application of state law.\n\nInstead, FDA regulations require a drug manufacturer—after initial federal approval of a drug's label—to revise the federally\napproved label “to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a\ndrug.”21 CFR § 201.80(e). Drug manufacturers are also required to “establish and maintain records and make reports” to the\nFDA about “[a]ny adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related,” after it\nhas received federal approval. §§ 314.80(a), (c), (j). In addition, the manufacturer must make periodic reports about “adverse\ndrug experience *593 [s]” associated with its drug and include “a history of actions taken since the last report because of\nadverse drug experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated).” §§ 314.80(c)(2)(i)-(ii). When such records and\nreports are not made, the FDA can withdraw its approval of the drug. § 314.80(j); see also 21 U.S.C. § 355(e) (“The Secretary\nmay ... withdraw the approval of an application ... if the Secretary finds ... that the applicant has failed to establish a system for\nmaintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make required reports”).\nThe FDA may also determine that a drug is no longer safe for use based on “clinical or other experience, tests, or other scientific\n **1211 data.” Ibid. (approval may be withdrawn if “the Secretary finds ... that clinical or other experience, tests, or other\nscientific data show that such drug is unsafe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the application was\napproved”).\n\nThe text of the statutory provisions and the accompanying regulatory scheme governing the FDA drug approval process,\ntherefore, establish that the FDA's initial approval of a drug is not a guarantee that the drug's label will never need to be changed.\nAnd nothing in the text of the statutory or regulatory scheme necessarily insulates Wyeth from liability under state law simply\nbecause the FDA has approved a particular label.\n\nIn sum, the relevant federal law did not give Wyeth a right that the state-law judgment took away, and it was possible for\nWyeth to comply with both federal law and the Vermont-law judgment at issue here. The federal statute and regulations neither\nprohibited the stronger warning label required by the state judgment, nor insulated Wyeth from the risk of state-law liability.\nWith no “direct conflict” between the federal and state law, then, the state-law judgment is not pre-empted.

L.Rev.\n70, 104 (2006) (“Legislators may compromise on a statute that does not fully address a perceived mischief, accepting half a loaf\nto *602 facilitate a law's enactment”). Therefore, there is no factual basis for the assumption underlying the Court's “purposes\nand objectives” pre-emption jurisprudence that every policy seemingly consistent with federal statutory text has necessarily\nbeen authorized by Congress and warrants pre-emptive effect. Instead, our federal system in general, and the Supremacy Clause\nin particular, accords pre-emptive effect to only those policies that are actually authorized by and effectuated through the\nstatutory text.\n\n\n\n                                                                   3\n\nThe majority, while reaching the right conclusion in this case, demonstrates once again how application of “purposes and\nobjectives” pre-emption requires inquiry into matters beyond the scope of proper judicial review. For example, the majority\nrelies heavily on Congress' failure “during the ... 70–year history” of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to enact an\nexpress pre-emption provision that addresses approval of a drug label by the FDA. Ante, at 1200. That “silence on the issue,\ncoupled with [Congress'] certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation,” the majority reasons, is evidence that\nCongress did not intend for federal approval of drug labels to pre-empt state tort judgments. Ibid.; see also ante, at 1199 –\n1200 (construing from inaction that Congress “[e]vidently [had] determined that widely available state rights of action provided\nappropriate relief”). Certainly, the absence of a statutory provision pre-empting all state tort suits related to approved federal\ndrug labels is pertinent to a finding that such lawsuits are not pre-empted. But the relevance is in the fact that no statute explicitly\npre-empts the lawsuits, and not in any inferences that the Court may draw from congressional silence about the motivations or\npolicies underlying Congress' failure to act.

Ante, at 1194. But that ignores the antecedent question\nof who—the FDA or a jury in Vermont—has the authority and responsibility for determining the “adequacy” of Phenergan's\nwarnings. Moreover, it is unclear how a “stronger” warning could have helped respondent, see ante, at 1199; after **1218 all,\nthe physician's assistant who treated her disregarded at least six separate warnings that are already on Phenergan's labeling, so\nrespondent would be hard pressed to prove that a seventh would have made a difference. 1\n\n1      Indeed, respondent conceded below that Wyeth did propose an adequate warning of Phenergan's risks. See Plaintiff Diana Levine's\n       Memorandum in Opposition to Wyeth's Motion for Summary Judgment in Levine v. American Home Products Corp. (now Wyeth),\n       No. 670–12–01 Wncv (Super. Ct. Washington Cty., Vt.), ¶ 7, p. 26. Specifically, respondent noted: “In 1988, Wyeth proposed\n       language that would have prevented this accident by requiring a running IV and explaining why a running IV will address and reduce\n       the risk [of intra-arterial injection].” Ibid. See also id., at 24 (“Although not strong enough, this improved the labeling instruction, if\n       followed, would have prevented the inadvertent administration of Phenergan into an artery ...”). The FDA rejected Wyeth's proposal.\n       See App. 359.\nMore to the point, the question presented by this case is not a “narrow” one, and it does not concern whether Phenergan's label\nshould bear a “stronger” warning. Rather, the real issue is whether a state tort jury can countermand the FDA's considered\njudgment that Phenergan's FDA-mandated warning label renders its intravenous (IV) use “safe.” Indeed, respondent's amended\ncomplaint alleged that Phenergan is “not reasonably safe for intravenous administration,” App. 15, ¶ 6; respondent's attorney\ntold the jury that Phenergan's label should say, “ ‘Do not use this drug intravenously,’ ” id., at 32; respondent's expert told the\n *606 jury, “I think the drug should be labeled ‘Not for IV use,’ ” id., at 59; and during his closing argument, respondent's\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The FDA has long\nknown about the risks associated with IV push in general and its use to administer Phenergan in particular. Whether wisely\nor not, the FDA has concluded—over the course of extensive, 54–year–long regulatory proceedings—that the drug is “safe”\nand “effective” when used in accordance with its FDA-mandated labeling. The unfortunate fact that respondent's healthcare\nproviders ignored Phenergan's labeling may make this an ideal medical-malpractice case. 3 But turning a common-law tort suit\ninto a “frontal assault” on the FDA's regulatory regime for drug labeling upsets the well-settled meaning of the Supremacy\nClause and our conflict pre-emption jurisprudence.

Acting\npursuant to that statutory mandate, the Secretary of Transportation promulgated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208,\nwhich required car manufacturers to include passive restraint systems (i.e., devices that work automatically to protect occupants\nfrom injury during a collision) in a certain percentage of their cars built in or after 1987. See 49 CFR § 571.208 (1999). Standard\n208 did not require installation of any particular type of passive restraint; instead, it gave manufacturers the option to install\nautomatic **1221 seatbelts, airbags, or any other suitable technology that they might develop, provided the restraint(s) met\nthe performance requirements specified in the rule. Ibid.\n\nAlexis Geier drove her 1987 Honda Accord into a tree, and although she was wearing her seatbelt, she nonetheless suffered\nserious injuries. She then sued Honda under state tort law, alleging that her car was negligently and defectively designed because\nit lacked a driver's-side airbag. She argued that Congress had empowered the Secretary to set only “minimum standard[s]”\nfor vehicle safety. 15 U.S.C. § 1391(2). She also emphasized that the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act contains\na saving clause, which *611 provides that “[c]ompliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this\nsubchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.” § 1397(k).\n\nNotwithstanding the statute's saving clause, and notwithstanding the fact that Congress gave the Secretary authority to set only\n“minimum” safety standards, we held Geier's state tort suit pre-empted. In reaching that result, we relied heavily on the view of\nthe Secretary of Transportation—expressed in an amicus brief—that Standard 208 “ ‘embodies the Secretary's policy judgment\nthat safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their fleets rather than one\nparticular system in every car.’ ” 529 U.S., at 881, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118371\"><a href=\"/opinion/118371/geier-v-american-honda-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the Secretary determined that a menu of alternative technologies was “safe,” the doctrine of\nconflict pre-emption barred Geier's efforts to deem some of those federally approved alternatives “unsafe” under state tort law.\n\nThe same rationale applies here. Through Phenergan's label, the FDA offered medical professionals a menu of federally\napproved, “safe” and “effective” alternatives—including IV push—for administering the drug. Through a state tort suit,\nrespondent attempted to deem IV push “unsafe” and “ineffective.” To be sure, federal law does not prohibit Wyeth from\ncontraindicating IV push, just as federal law did not prohibit Honda from installing airbags in all its cars. But just as we held that\nStates may not compel the latter, so, too, are States precluded from compelling the former. See also Fidelity Fed.

If anything, a finding of\npre-emption is even more appropriate here because the FDCA—unlike the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act—\ncontains no evidence that Congress intended *612 the FDA to set only “minimum standards,” and the FDCA does not contain\na saving clause. 4 SEE ALSO **1222 ante, at 1200 (conceding congress' “ silence” on the issue).\n\n4      To be sure, Congress recognized the principles of conflict pre-emption in the FDCA.

Second, as a legal matter, Geier does not stand for the legal propositions espoused by the dissenters\n(and specifically rejected by the majority) in that case. Third, drug labeling by jury verdict undermines both our broader pre-\nemption jurisprudence and the broader workability of the federal drug-labeling regime.\n\n\n\n                                                                 A\n\nPhenergan's warning label has been subject to the FDA's strict regulatory oversight since the 1950's. For at least the last 34 years,\nthe FDA has focused specifically on whether IV-push administration of Phenergan is “safe” and “effective” when performed\nin accordance with Phenergan's label. The agency's ultimate decision—to retain IV push as one *613 means for administering\nPhenergan, albeit subject to stringent warnings—is reflected in the plain text of Phenergan's label (sometimes in boldfaced\nfont and all-capital letters). And the record contains ample evidence that the FDA specifically considered and reconsidered the\nstrength of Phenergan's IV-push-related warnings in light of new scientific and medical data. The majority's factual assertions\nto the contrary are mistaken.\n\n\n\n                                                                 1\n\nThe FDA's focus on IV push as a means of administering Phenergan dates back at least to 1975. In August of that year, several\nrepresentatives from both the FDA and Wyeth met to discuss Phenergan's warning label. At that meeting, the FDA specifically\nproposed “that Phenergan Injection should not be used in Tubex & reg;.” 2 Record 583, 586 (Plaintiff's Trial Exh. 17, Internal\nCorrespondence from W.E. Langeland to File (Sept. 5, 1975) (hereinafter 1975 Memo)). “Tubex” is a syringe system used\nexclusively for IV push. See App. 43. An FDA official explained that the agency's concerns arose from medical-malpractice\nlawsuits involving IV push of the drug, see 1975 Memo 586, and that the FDA was aware of “5 cases involving amputation\nwhere the drug had been administered by Tubex together with several additional cases involving necrosis,” id., at 586–587.\nRather than contraindicating Phenergan for IV push, however, the agency and Wyeth agreed “that there was a need for better\ninstruction regarding the problems of intraarterial injection.” Id., at 587.\n\nThe next year, the FDA convened an advisory committee to study, among other things, the risks associated with the Tubex\nsystem and IV push. App. 294. At the conclusion of its study, the committee recommended an additional IV-push-specific\nwarning for Phenergan's label, see ibid., but did not recommend eliminating IV push from the drug label altogether. In response\nto the committee's recommendations, the FDA instructed Wyeth to make several changes to *614 strengthen Phenergan's\nlabel, including the addition of upper case warnings related to IV push. See id., at 279–280, 282–283.\n\n**1223 In 1987, the FDA directed Wyeth to amend its label to include the following text:\n\n  “ ‘[1] When used intravenously, [Phenergan] should be given in a concentration no greater than 25 mg/ml and at a rate not to\n  exceed 25 mg/minute. [2] Injection through a properly running intravenous infusion may enhance the possibility of detecting\n  arterial placement.’ ” Id., at 311–312.\n\nThe first of the two quoted sentences refers specifically to IV push; as respondent's medical expert testified at trial, the label's\nrecommended rate of administration (not to exceed 25 mg per minute) refers to “IV push, as opposed to say being in a bag\nand dripped over a couple of hours.” Id., at 52. The second of the two quoted sentences refers to IV drip. See id., at 15–16\n(emphasizing that a “running IV” is the same thing as “IV drip”).\n\nIn its 1987 labeling order, the FDA cited voluminous materials to “suppor[t]” its new and stronger warnings related to IV\npush and the preferability of IV drip. 5 Id., at 313. One of those articles specifically discussed the relative advantages and\ndisadvantages of IV drip compared to IV push, as *615 well as the costs and benefits of administering Phenergan via IV push. 6\nThe FDA also cited published case reports from the 1960's of gangrene caused by the intra-arterial injection of Phenergan, 7 and\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The FDA required Wyeth to include Hager and\n         Wilson's observations on Phenergan's label. See App. 311 (requiring the label to warn that “ ‘[t]he first sign [of an intra-arterial\n         injection] may be the patient's reaction to a sensation of fiery burning’ ” pain and “ ‘[b]lanching’ ”).\n9        See Enloe 427 (discussing hydroxyzine—an antihistamine with chemical properties similar to those of Phenergan—and suggesting\n         its “temporary” benefits can never outweigh the risks of intra-arterial injection); see also Goldsmith & Trieger, Accidental Intra–\n         Arterial Injection: A Medical Emergency, 22 Anesthesia Progress 180 (1975) (noting the risks of intra-arterial administration of\n         hydroxyzine) (cited in App. 315, no. 18); Klatte, Brooks, & Rhamy, Toxicity of Intra–Arterial Barbituates and Tranquilizing Drugs,\n         92 Radiology 700 (1969) (same) (cited in App. 314, no. 13). With full knowledge of those risks, FDA retained IV push for Phenergan,\n         although the agency required Wyeth to incorporate observations from the Enloe article into Phenergan's label. Compare Enloe 427\n         (arguing that “every precaution should be taken to avoid inadvertent intra-arterial injection,” including the use of “an obviously well-\n         functioning venoclysis”), with App. 312 (FDA's 1987 changes to Phenergan's label). In contrast, at some time around 1970, the\n         FDA prohibited all intravenous use of hydroxyzine. See id., at 79 (testimony of Dr. Harold Green). The FDA's decision to regulate\n         the two drugs differently—notwithstanding (1) the agency's knowledge of the risks associated with both drugs and (2) the agency's\n         recognition of the relevance of hydroxyzine-related articles and case reports in its regulation of Phenergan—further demonstrates\n         that the FDA intentionally preserved IV-push administration for Phenergan. See also Haas, Correspondence, 33 Anesthesia Progress\n         281 (1986) (“[Hydroxyzine's] restriction does not lie with the medicine itself, but in the practice and malpractice of intravenous\n         techniques. Unfortunately, the practitioner who knows how to treat injection technique problems is usually not the practitioner with\n         the intravenous technique problems”).\n *616 In “support” of its labeling order, the FDA also cited numerous articles that singled out the inner crook of the elbow\n—known as the “antecubital fossa” in the medical community—which is both a commonly used injection site, see id., at 70\n(noting that respondent's injection was pushed into “the antecubital space”), and a universally recognized high-risk area for\ninadvertent intra-arterial injections. One of the articles explained:\n\n    “Because of the numerous superficial positions the ulnar artery might occupy, it has often been entered during attempted\n    venipuncture [of the antecubital fossa]. ... However, the brachial and the radial arteries might also be quite superficial in the\n    elbow region .... The arterial variations of the arm, especially in and about the cubital fossa, are common and numerous.\n    If venipuncture must be performed in this area, a higher index of suspicion must be maintained to forestall misdirected\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For example, the label warned of the risks of intra-arterial injection\nassociated with “aspiration,” which is a technique used only in conjunction with IV push. 12 The *618 label also cautioned\nagainst the use of “syringes with rigid plungers,” App. 390, which are used only to administer the drug via IV push. As\nrespondent's medical expert testified at trial, “by talking plungers and rigid needles, that's the way you do it, to push it with the\nplunger.” Id., at 53 (testimony of Dr. John Matthew). Moreover, Phenergan's 2000 label devoted almost a full page to discussing\nthe “Tubex system,” see id., at 391, which, as noted above, is used only to administer the drug via IV push.\n\n12     “Aspiration” refers to drawing a small amount of blood back into the needle to determine whether the needle is in an artery or a vein.\n       Ordinarily, arterial blood is brighter than venous blood—but contact with Phenergan causes discoloration, which makes aspiration an\n       unreliable method of protecting against intra-arterial injection. See id., at 282. Therefore, the label warned that when using IV push, a\n       medical professional should beware that “[a]spiration of dark blood does not preclude intra-arterial needle placement, because blood\n       is discolored upon contact with Phenergan Injection.” Id., at 390.\nWhile Phenergan's label very clearly authorized the use of IV push, it also made clear that IV push is the delivery method\nof last resort. The label specified that “[t]he preferred parenteral route of administration is by deep intramuscular injection.”\nId., at 390. If an intramuscular injection is ineffective, then “it is usually preferable to inject [Phenergan] through the tubing\nof an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily.” Ibid. See also id., at 50–51 (testimony of\nrespondent's medical expert, Dr. John Matthew) (conceding that the best way to determine that an IV set is functioning\nsatisfactorily is to use IV drip). Finally, if for whatever reason a medical professional chooses to use IV push, he or she is on\nnotice that “INADVERTENT INTRA–ARTERIAL INJECTION CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED\nEXTREMITY.” Id., at 391; see also id., at 390 (“Under no circumstances should Phenergan Injection be given by intra-arterial\ninjection due to the likelihood of severe arteriospasm and the possibility of resultant gangrene”).\n\nPhenergan's label also directs medical practitioners to choose veins wisely when using IV push:\n\n  “Due to the close proximity of arteries and veins in the areas most commonly used for intravenous injection, extreme *619\n  care should be exercised to avoid perivascular extravasation or inadvertent intra-arterial injection.

And whatever else might be said about the extensive medical authorities and\ncase reports that the FDA cited in “support” of its approval of IV-push administration of Phenergan, it cannot be said that the\nFDA “paid no more than passing attention to” IV push, ante, at 1193; nor can it be said that the FDA failed to weigh its costs\nand benefits, Brief for Respondent 50.\n\n\n\n                                                                        3\n\nFor her part, respondent does not dispute the FDA's conclusion that IV push has certain benefits. At trial, her medical\npractitioners testified that they used IV push in order to help her “in a swift and timely way” when she showed up at the\nhospital for the second time in one day complaining of “intractable” migraines, “terrible pain,” inability to “bear light or sound,”\nsleeplessness, hours-long spasms of “retching” and “vomiting,” and when “every possible” alternative treatment had “failed.”\nApp. 40 (testimony of Dr. John Matthew); id., at 103, 106, 109 (testimony of physician's assistant Jessica Fisch).\n\nRather than disputing the benefits of IV push, respondent complains that the FDA and Wyeth underestimated its costs (and\nhence did not provide sufficient warnings regarding its risks). But when the FDA mandated that Phenergan's label read,\n“INADVERTENT INTRA–ARTERIAL INJECTION *620 CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED\nEXTREMITY,” id., at 391, and when the FDA required Wyeth to warn that “[u]nder no circumstances should Phenergan\nInjection be given by intra-arterial injection,” id., at 390, the agency could reasonably assume that medical professionals would\ntake care not to inject Phenergan intra-arterially. See also 71 Fed.Reg. 3934 (noting that a drug's warning label “communicates\nto health care practitioners the agency's formal, authoritative conclusions regarding the conditions under which the product\ncan be used safely and effectively”). Unfortunately, the physician's assistant who treated respondent in this case disregarded\nPhenergan's label and pushed the drug into the single spot on her arm that is most likely to cause an inadvertent intra-arterial\ninjection.\n\nAs noted above, when the FDA approved Phenergan's label, it was textbook medical knowledge that the “antecubital fossa”\ncreates a high risk of inadvertent intra-arterial injection, given the close proximity of veins and arteries. See supra, at 1224 –\n1225; see also The Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice 99 (7th ed.2001) (noting, in a red-text “NURSING ALERT,” that\nthe antecubital fossa is “not recommended” for administering dangerous drugs, “due to the potential for extravasation”). 13\nAccording to the physician's assistant who injured respondent, however, “[i]t never crossed my mind” that an antecubital\ninjection of Phenergan could hit an artery. App. 110; see also ibid. (“[It] just wasn't something that I was aware of at the\ntime”). Oblivious to the risks emphasized in Phenergan's warnings, the physician's assistant pushed a double dose of the drug\ninto an antecubital artery over the course of “[p]robably about three to four minutes,” id., at 111; id., at 105, notwithstanding\nrespondent's *621 complaints of a “ ‘burn [ing]’ ” sensation that she subsequently described as “ ‘one of the most extreme\npains that I've ever felt,’ ” **1227 id., at 110, 180–181. And when asked why she ignored Phenergan's label and failed to stop\npushing the drug after respondent complained of burning pains, the physician's assistant explained that it would have been “just\ncrazy” to “worr[y] about an [intra-arterial] injection” under the circumstances, id., at 111.\n\n13     In addition, respondent's own medical expert testified at trial that it is a principle of “basic anatomy” that the antecubital fossa contains\n       aberrant arteries. See 2 Tr. 34–35 (Mar. 9, 2004) (testimony of Dr. Daniel O'Brien); see also ibid. (noting that Gray's Anatomy, which\n       is “the Bible of anatomy,” also warns of arteries in the antecubital space).\nThe FDA, however, did not think that the risks associated with IV push—especially in the antecubital space—were “just crazy.”\nThat is why Phenergan's label so clearly warns against them.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

As we explained in Riegel,\njuries tend to focus on the risk of a **1230 particular product's design or warning label that arguably contributed to a particular\nplaintiff's injury, not on the overall benefits of that design or label; “the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented\nin court.” 552 U.S., at 325, 128 S.Ct., at 1008. Indeed, patients like respondent are the only ones whom tort juries ever see,\nand for a patient like respondent—who has already suffered a tragic accident—Phenergan's risks are no longer a matter of\nprobabilities and potentialities.\n\nIn contrast, the FDA has the benefit of the long view. Its drug-approval determinations consider the interests of all potential\nusers of a drug, including “those who would suffer without new medical [products]” if juries in all 50 States were free to\ncontradict the FDA's expert determinations. Id., at ––––, 128 S.Ct., at 1009. And the FDA conveys its warnings with one voice,\nrather than whipsawing the medical community with 50 (or more) potentially conflicting ones. After today's ruling, however,\nparochialism may prevail.\n\nThe problem is well illustrated by the labels borne by “vesicant” drugs, many of which are used for chemotherapy. As a class,\nvesicants are much more dangerous than drugs like Phenergan, 15 but the vast majority of vesicant labels—like Phenergan's—\neither allow or do not disallow IV push. See Appendix, infra. Because vesicant extravasation can have devastating consequences,\nand because the potentially lifesaving benefits of these drugs offer hollow solace to the victim *627 of such a tragedy, a jury's\ncost-benefit analysis in a particular case may well differ from the FDA's.\n\n15     Vesicants may cause “blistering, severe tissue injury, or tissue necrosis” upon extravasation—even if the drug is not injected into an\n       artery. See, e.g., Schulmeister, Administering Vesicants, 9 Clinical J. of Oncology Nursing 469, 469–470 (2005). See also ante, at\n       1192 (majority opinion) (noting that Phenergan is labeled as an “irritant”); cf. Brief for Anju Budhwani et al. as Amici Curiae 15\n       (suggesting Phenergan should be considered a “vesicant”).\nFor example, consider Mustargen (mechlorethamine HCl)—the injectable form of mustard gas—which can be used as an\nanticancer drug. Mustargen's FDA-approved label warns in several places that “This drug is HIGHLY TOXIC.” 16 Indeed,\nthe drug is so highly toxic:\n\n16     FDA, Oncology Tools Product Label Details, online at http:// www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/onctools/labels.cfm?\n       GN=meclorethamine,% 20nitrogen% 20mustard (as visited Mar. 2, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).\n\n\n  “Should accidental eye contact occur, copious irrigation for at least 15 minutes with water, normal saline or a balanced salt\n  ophthalmic irrigating solution should be instituted immediately, followed by prompt ophthalmologic consultation. Should\n  accidental skin contact occur, the affected part must be irrigated immediately with copious amounts of water, for at least 15\n  minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes, followed by 2% sodium thiosulfate solution. Medical attention\n  should be sought immediately. Contaminated clothing should be destroyed.” 17\n17     Ibid.\nYet when it comes to administering this highly toxic drug, the label provides that “the drug may be injected directly into any\nsuitable vein, [but] it is injected preferably into the rubber or plastic tubing of a flowing intravenous infusion set. This reduces\nthe possibility of severe local reactions due to extravasation or high concentration of the drug.” (Emphasis added.) Similarly,\nthe FDA-approved labels for other powerful chemotherapeutic vesicants **1231 —including Dactinomycin, Oxaliplatin,\nVinblastine, and Vincristine—specifically allow IV push, notwithstanding their devastating effects when extravasated.\n\n *628 The fact that the labels for such drugs allow IV push is striking—both because vesicants are much more dangerous than\nPhenergan, and also because they are so frequently extravasated, see Boyle & Engelking, Vesicant Extravasation: Myths and\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.
