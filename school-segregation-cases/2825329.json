We generally affirm the district court, but remand for\nconsideration of whether class should be certified with a new lead\nplaintiff.\n\f6          ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n                                  I.\n\n   Virginia Anderson is a black female employed at the Department\nof Energy’s Savannah River Site. The Savannah River Site is man-\naged for the Department of Energy by Westinghouse Savannah River\nCompany, LLC (Westinghouse). Bechtel Savannah River, Inc.,\n(Bechtel), Babcox & Wilcox Savannah River Company (B & W), and\nBritish Nuclear Fuels Ltd. Savannah River Corporation (BNFL) also\nparticipate in the management of the Savannah River Site pursuant to\na contract with the Department of Energy. Each company is a defen-\ndant in this action.\n\n   In the past, the Savannah River Site produced materials needed for\nthe fabrication of nuclear weapons, but its current mission is focused\non environmental cleanup and processing radioactive materials. The\nSavannah River Site covers 310 square miles in western South Caro-\nlina, and, in 1999, over 13,000 employees worked at the sites for the\nfour defendants. Of those employees, 2765 were black.\n\n   Virginia Anderson began working at the Savannah River Site in\n1978 as a typist in a typing pool. Miss Anderson became a stenogra-\npher a year later. She worked as a stenographer in several different\ndepartments at the Savannah River Site until 1989. In 1989, Miss\nAnderson became an administrative secretary in the materials technol-\nogy group. The transition from stenographer to administrative secre-\ntary was a promotion for Miss Anderson, and, as an administrative\nsecretary, she had more responsibilities. As an administrative secre-\ntary, Miss Anderson received a salary at the SGL 16 level. Miss\nAnderson remained with the materials technology group until July of\n1998. In August of 1998, she received a promotion to administrative\nassistant in the university relations group within the chemicals hydro-\ngen technology group. With her promotion, Miss Anderson’s salary\nlevel increased to SGL 28 SOP. SOP stands for selective overtime\npositions, and, as a SGL 28 SOP employee, Miss Anderson received\nadditional compensation above her salary if she worked a certain\nnumber of hours above her normal working hours. Miss Anderson\nremained with the university relations group through the time she\nfiled her lawsuit against the defendants.\n\n  When she began working at the Savannah River Site, Miss Ander-\nson’s higher educational background was limited to an executive sec-\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                 7\nretary diploma from Augusta Tech, which she received in 1977.\nDuring her tenure at the Savannah River Site, Miss Anderson pursued\nfurther higher education degrees. In 1996, Miss Anderson took her\nbachelor of science degree in human resources management from\nSouthern Wesleyan University. In June of 1998, Miss Anderson\nreceived her masters in business administration from Nova Southeast-\nern University. Miss Anderson’s promotion from administrative sec-\nretary, with a pay level of SGL 16, to administrative assistant, with\na pay level of SGL 28 SOP, came just months after she received her\nM.B.A.\n\n    In the 1990’s, the Savannah River Site instituted two programs, one\nfor promotions and one for merit pay increases, that are at issue in this\nlitigation. The first is the Competency Based Posting System, or\nCBPS. The Competency Based System is an application and promo-\ntion system which Savannah River Site employees may use to apply\nfor new positions and promotions. Under the system, exempt or non-\nexempt employees may apply for any posted position that is available,\nwith a few exceptions. According to the description contained in\nWestinghouse Savannah River Company 5B Manual, the hiring and\npromotion process under the Competency Based System is as follows:\n\n      1. Open position is submitted to HR for posting.\n\n          The hiring manager ensures the position description is\n          complete and correct; adding, and weighing the values\n          of, necessary competencies. HR Compensation estab-\n          lishes the salary grade of the position at or below the\n          salary grade of the previous incumbent (if any). No\n          preferred candidates exist in this system.\n\n      2. HR posts the position in ShRINE (sic) for ten working\n         days.\n\n      3. The hiring manager establishes an interview panel.\n\n          With the HR lead, the hiring manager selects appropri-\n          ate individuals, based on their job knowledge and\n          familiarity with the position, to sit on an interview\n\f8         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n         panel. The panel consists of three members, one of\n         whom must always be the hiring manager.\n\n     4. Self-nominating individuals submit their qualifications\n        to HR-Staffing.\n\n         Submitted qualifications can include a Personal His-\n         tory form (OSR 27-13) and/or resume.\n\n     5. Individuals nominated by others submit their qualifica-\n        tions to HR-Staffing.\n\n         With their consent, candidates can be nominated by\n         others. Nominations are not restricted to managers.\n         The hiring manager cannot nominate. Candidates sub-\n         mit a Personal History form (OSR 27-13) or resume\n         and copies of their last three performance appraisals to\n         HR-Staffing.\n\n     6. HR confirms that applicants meet posted position\n        requirements.\n\n         Eligible candidates are identified based on minimum\n         requirements listed in the position profile.\n\n     7. HR-Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) reviews\n        the list of applicants for consistency with corporate\n        and affirmative action planning.\n\n     8. HR-Staffing submits eligible applicants to the hiring\n        manager.\n\n     9. Within five working days of receiving the material\n        from HR-Staffing, the hiring manager selects candi-\n        dates for interviews.\n\n    10. All applicants are informed of the status of their appli-\n        cation.\n\f     ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.              9\n11. Individuals selected for an interview receive a candi-\n    date information package regarding the interview pro-\n    cess.\n\n12. The hiring manager schedules and conducts, with the\n    panel, interviews within 10 working days after candi-\n    dates are notified of their status.\n\n13. The hiring manager selects the candidate who best\n    meets position requirements.\n\n     The final decision is made by the hiring manager with\n     input from the other two interview panel members and\n     after review by the HR lead. The next level of manage-\n     ment must also review and approve the selected candi-\n     date.\n\n14. HR-EEO review candidate selection for consistency\n    with corporate and affirmative action planning.\n\n15. If a promotion is necessary, HR-Compensation, HR-\n    EEO, and the division HR lead review the decision to\n    ensure that all relevant criteria are met.\n\n16. HR-Staffing prepares a formal offer and the hiring\n    manager extends the offer to the candidate.\n\n17. The candidate accepts or rejects the offer within two\n    calendar days.\n\n18. The hiring manager informs all interviewed candidates\n    and the sending manager of the selected candidate of\n    the selection process outcome.\n\n19. The selected candidate is released to the new position\n    within four weeks of acceptance.\n\n     If the releasing manager and the hiring manager both\n     agree, the release time-frame can be shortened. The\n     release time-frame cannot exceed four weeks.\n\f10         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n   Under the Competency Based System, hiring managers can evalu-\nate applicants in six core competencies: teamwork, leadership, com-\nmunications, business results, self-management, and employee\ndevelopment. The hiring managers can also evaluate applicants using\nselected functional competencies that are specific to the position for\nwhich the manager is hiring. For example, a particular functional\ncompetency could be \"[p]roficient in heating, ventilation and air-\nconditioning design,\" and the CBPS manual explains that\n\"[f]unctional competencies can be derived from the responsibility sec-\ntion on the job description.\" Each competency is assigned a weight,\nusing a number from one to five, in which five is \"[m]ost important\nrelative to other competencies\" and one is \"[l]east important relative\nto other competencies.\" The interview panel then selects candidates\nfor interviews and then interviews each selected candidate.\n\n   Each applicant who is interviewed is evaluated by the interview\npanel using the core and functional competencies. The interview\npanel determines a weighted score for each applicant on each core\nand functional competency. The panel determines the weighted score\nby multiplying the weight given to each competency (one to five) by\nthe applicant’s rating for each competency. The panel rates the appli-\ncant on a scale of one to five, with a five meaning \"[d]emonstrates\nexceptional competence\" and a one meaning \"[d]id not demonstrate\nexpected level of competence.\" The panel determines the applicant’s\ntotal weighted score by adding together the weighted scores for each\ncompetency. The hiring manager then selects the candidate for the\nposition, after noting the total weighted scores for each candidate, and\nrecords the basis for selecting the chosen candidate.\n\n   The second program instituted at the Savannah River Site was the\nRanked Performance Pay Process, or RP3. The Site began using the\nprogram in 1997 to rank exempt and selected overtime position\nemployees for merit increases in salary. Two major factors are uti-\nlized under the RP3 system to determine which employees should\nreceive merit raises. Job performance constitutes 75% of the ranking\ngiven to an employee, and the remaining 25% is derived from rank-\nings on Site Imperatives. Site Imperatives \"are the basis of how we\n[Site employees] each are expected to accomplish the business objec-\ntives of our work group, division, and company as a whole.\" The five\nSite Imperatives are safety, disciplined operations, cost effectiveness,\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.              11\ncontinuous improvement, and teamwork. Each Site Imperative is\nweighted five percent in the total ranking, with the total for all five\nconstituting 25% of an employee’s final ranking.\n\n   Under the RP3 system, each manager must use the RP3 electronic\nevaluation worksheet to rate each employee in the manager’s organi-\nzation. The evaluation process begins with the smallest unit of organi-\nzation, the department or section. Once the initial rankings are\ncomputed for the department or section, all employees within a single\nwork group are ranked by the next level of management. At the next\nstep, the rankings for a division, each division’s manager may inte-\ngrate the work group rankings to achieve a ranking of employees\nwithin the division. The division manager may rank all employees in\nvarious combinations. Among the combinations suggested by the RP3\nsystem manual are (1) total ranking of all employees; (2) rank within\nseparate work groups; (3) managers, leads, and professionals; (4) sal-\nary grade clusters, i.e., all SGL 16 employees or all SGL 32 to 34\nemployees; or (5) managers, leads, and professionals by salary grade\nclusters.\n\n   The employee rankings for each division are then broken into per-\nformance categories consisting of the high 15%, the middle 80%, and\nthe low five percent. Final rankings are approved by the division man-\nager, and merit salary increases are awarded based on each division’s\nbudget and salary guidechart. The Human Resources Compensation\ndepartment must approve any merit increases that are outside of the\nsalary guidechart. All employees, regardless of their ranking percent-\nage, are eligible for merit increases, but the top 15% may receive the\nhighest merit increases. Another factor that contributes to the size of\na merit increase is whether the employee is above or below the mid-\npoint of their salary grade. For example, if an employee is an A per-\nformer whose salary level is below the midpoint of his salary grade,\nhe is eligible to receive a merit increase, the amount of which may\nbe different if he is an A performer whose salary level is above the\nmidpoint of his salary grade.\n\n   In ranking their employees for job performance, which accounts for\n75% of an employee’s ranking, the RP3 manual instructs managers\nto consider the following factors:\n\f12         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n      Job expectations\n      Quality and quantity of work\n      Position scope (performance against position description)\n      Support to achieving commitments\n      Feedback from others (managers, peers, or customers)\n      Awards, recognition\n      Performance standards (leadership, judgment)\n\nFor job performance, an employee receives a rating of either \"Low,\"\nmeaning \"[c]onsistently performs at a level below expectations,\" or\n\"Mid,\" meaning \"[c]onsistently performs at the level of expectations,\"\nor \"High, \" meaning \"consistently performs at a level that exceeds\nexpectations.\" Managers also use the low, mid, or high rankings to\nevaluate their employees in the five Site Imperatives. The RP3 man-\nual lists the performance indicators that managers should use when\ndetermining whether an employee should receive a low, mid, or high\nrank for each imperative.\n\n   In her lawsuit, Miss Anderson complains about three separate\ninstances in which she sought and subsequently failed to receive a\npromotion. In 1997, Miss Anderson applied for the position of\nAdministrative Assistant in the Environmental Restoration Division.\nThe hiring manager, Miss Gail Toddings, posted the opening using\nthe CBPS, and approximately 150 employees applied for the position.\nAfter the Site’s Human Resources department evaluated the applica-\ntions, 30 to 40 resumes were sent to Miss Toddings. The outgoing\nadministrative assistant, Miss Laboris Curry, assisted Miss Toddings\nin evaluating the resumes and choosing 15 people to interview. Miss\nToddings made the final decision on who would be interviewed. Miss\nAnderson was selected for an interview, and she interviewed for the\nposition on December 15, 1997, before an interview panel chaired by\nMiss Toddings. The interview panel recommended and Miss Todd-\nings selected Mrs. Linda Clarke for the position. Mrs. Clarke, a white\nwoman, received the highest consensus rating, a score of 190, among\nall of the employees who were interviewed.1 Miss Anderson received\n  1\n   190 was the highest rating among the employees interviewed for the\nposition. Mrs. Clarke and another employee, Miss Shirley King, both\nreceived scores of 190. (JA 11107-11108, 11115-11116) Miss King is a\nwhite woman. (JA 11169)\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               13\na rating score of 136, the second-lowest score given by the interview\npanel. The interview panel gave its lowest rating score of 129.5 to a\nwhite female employee.\n\n   In 1998, Miss Anderson applied for the position of Administrative\nAssistant in the Business Development and Community Outreach\nDivision. Miss Anderson was not selected for an interview on the\nbasis of her low scores for the functional competencies of the posi-\ntion. Only two applicants received higher scores in core competencies\nthan Miss Anderson, but eight applicants had higher ratings in the\nfunctional competencies. Miss Anderson received a rating of 59 out\nof a possible 72 for core competencies and a rating of 9 out of a possi-\nble 57 for functional competencies, for a total rating of 68. In con-\ntrast, the individual chosen for the promotion, Mrs. Brenda Pearson\n(formerly Miss Brenda Boggs), a white woman, received a rating of\n60 out of a possible 72 for core competencies and a rating of 57 out\nof a possible 57 for functional competencies, for a total rating of 117.\nMrs. Pearson received the promotion, and Miss Anderson did not.\n\n   Miss Anderson also alleges that she was denied a promotion from\nSGL 28 SOP to SGL 30 while in her position as administrative assis-\ntant in the university relations group. She complains that she was told\nshe had to work in her current position for two to four years before\nshe could receive a promotion in place. She contends that white\nemployees received promotions in place without having to work in\ntheir positions for two to four years.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   This lawsuit began on October 31, 1997, when ten black Site\nemployees filed a class action lawsuit against the defendants. The ten\nplaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and Title VII alleg-\ning that the defendants denied black employees promotions on an\nequal basis with white employees, maintained salary discrepancies\nbetween black and white employees, denied black employees access\nto training opportunities on an equal basis with white employees,\ndemoted black employees on the basis of their race, and discriminated\nagainst black employees by keeping them in less desirable positions.\nThe ten plaintiffs also brought individual claims for disparate treat-\n\f14         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nment on the basis of race. Miss Anderson later joined the lawsuit as\na plaintiff, and a total of 99 individuals became plaintiffs.\n\n   The plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of all current and\nformer black employees of the defendants who worked at the Site\nwho had been or will be subject to discrimination by the defendants.\nAfter oral argument was held on the class certification motion, the\ndistrict court denied the motion \"as to the proposed class or any sub-\nclass suggested by Plaintiffs.\" The district court determined that the\nplaintiffs’ \"across the board\" challenges to the defendants’ employee\npractices did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure and were not supported by governing\nSupreme Court and Fourth Circuit case law.\n\n   After denying the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, the dis-\ntrict court ordered the plaintiffs to pursue their claims individually.\nFollowing the district court’s instruction, Miss Anderson filed an\namended complaint on July 26, 2000. In her complaint, she brings\nclaims for disparate impact discrimination, relating to the defendants’\nuse of the CBPS and RP3 systems and to the defendants’ pay prac-\ntices, and claims for disparate treatment, relating to the three promo-\ntions she did not receive.\n\n   The district court held an evidentiary hearing after ruling on the\nmotions for class certification. At issue in the hearing was the pro-\nposed testimony of Dr. Edwin L. Bradley, the plaintiff’s prospective\nexpert witness. After listening to testimony and argument, the district\ncourt excluded from evidence Dr. Bradley’s proposed expert opinion\ntestimony on the discriminatory impact of the RP3 system. The dis-\ntrict court excluded this testimony on the grounds that it was based\non statistical research and analysis that did not have proper controls.\nDr. Bradley had conducted several studies regarding the RP3 system.\nIn several instances, Dr. Bradley’s statistical analysis compared black\nand white employees under the RP3 ranking system without taking\ninto account any differences in their job titles or position. The district\ncourt also excluded from evidence a draft copy of an assessment of\nWestinghouse’s equal employment opportunity, human resources, and\nemployee concerns programs conducted by the Department of\nEnergy.\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                15\n   The district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment as to Miss Anderson’s individual disparate impact and dis-\nparate treatment claims. The district court denied the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment as to Miss Anderson’s disparate treat-\nment pay claim, but Miss Anderson had the remaining claim dis-\nmissed with prejudice so that she could pursue this appeal.\n\n                                  III.\n\n   We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants de novo, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences\ndrawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Anderson. See Ander-\nson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986); Williams v.\nGiant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 428 (4th Cir. 2004). Summary judg-\nment should only be granted when there are no genuine issues of\nmaterial fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Walton v. Greenbriar\nFord, Inc., 370 F.3d 446, 449 (4th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   The district court denied the motion for class certification on July\n19, 2000. In its order and opinion denying class certification, the dis-\ntrict court directed the 99 plaintiffs to proceed with their cases on an\nindividual basis. The district court found that\n\n    not one single named Plaintiff in the proposed class asserts\n    claims involving all of the programs attacked; rather, the\n    pattern is one of combinations and permutations of some\n    Plaintiffs on some claims and different combinations and\n    permutations of Plaintiffs on other claims, etcetera.\n\nSlip op. at 48. The district court cannot certify a class action in which\nthe class representative is not part of the class and does not \"‘possess\nthe same interest and suffer the same injury’ as the class members.\"\nBroussard v. Meineke Discount Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331,\n338 (4th Cir. 1998) (quoting E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys. Inc. v. Rodri-\nguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977)).\n\f16           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n    On appeal, Anderson argues that the district court should have cer-\ntified two subclasses of black employees with disparate impact claims\ninvolving the Competency Based Posting System and the Ranked Per-\nformance Pay Process. In its opinion denying the plaintiffs’ motion\nfor class certification, the district court noted that the plaintiffs’ pro-\nposed subclasses, if they had been raised in a timely fashion instead\nof as part of the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the district\ncourt’s ruling on class certification, would be denied because of the\nfailure of the proposed classes to satisfy the requirements of common-\nality and typicality.\n\n   After denying the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, the dis-\ntrict court held a hearing to consider evidentiary issues. At the conclu-\nsion of the hearing, the district court granted the defendants’ motion\nto exclude the opinion of the plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Edwin L. Bradley,\nabout the RP3 rankings and about merit increases under the RP3 sys-\ntem. Miss Anderson appeals from the district court’s ruling on the\nadmissibility of this evidence. We address these contentions first.\n\n                                     V.\n\n   We review a district court’s decision to admit or exclude expert\nevidence under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509\nU.S. 579 (1993), for abuse of discretion. Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522\nU.S. 136, 138-39 (1997). If the district court makes an error of law\nin deciding an evidentiary question, that error is \"by definition an\nabuse of discretion.\" See Hunter v. Earthgrains Co. Bakery, 281 F.3d\n144, 150 (4th Cir. 2002). In Daubert, the Supreme Court explained\nthat the previous test for the admissibility of \"novel scientific evi-\ndence\" based on Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923),\nwas superseded by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 585-589.\n\n     Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides:\n\n       If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will\n       assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to deter-\n       mine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n       knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may\n       testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1)\n\f            ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                 17\n      the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the\n      testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,\n      and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods\n      reliably to the facts of the case.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702. When a party seeks to admit any expert testimony,\nthe district court’s obligation is \"gatekeeping.\" See Kumho Tire Co.\nv. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141 (1999). As the gatekeeper, the dis-\ntrict court should analyze the proposed expert testimony using several\nfactors, including whether the expert opinion can be tested and\nwhether it has been subjected to peer review. Daubert, 509 U.S. at\n592-94. The district court should also consider the rate of error of the\nmethods employed by the expert, the existence and maintenance of\nstandards used in the expert’s methods, and whether the expert’s\nmethods have been generally accepted by his or her respective com-\nmunity. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 594; see also United States v. Crisp, 324\nF.3d 261, 265-66 (4th Cir. 2003) (listing Daubert factors to be applied\nin analyzing expert testimony).\n\n   Miss Anderson sought to introduce into evidence Dr. Bradley’s tes-\ntimony about the differences in RP3 ratings given to blacks as com-\npared to those given to whites. The report upon which this testimony\nwould be based showed that for the years 1998 and 1999 the number\nof standard deviations between the RP3 rankings given to black\nexempt employees and white exempt employees was -2.61 and -2.14,\nrespectively. In making the comparisons, Dr. Bradley controlled the\nanalysis using job groups. In other words, Dr. Bradley’s analysis\nshowed that, using the job groups as the category in which employees\nare grouped, that whites had higher RP3 rankings than blacks.2 The\ndistrict court found this analysis wanting.\n  2\n    Dr. Bradley’s testimony also would have relied on nine other studies\nthat also failed to properly compare employees in similar job positions\nand titles. Several of Dr. Bradley’s studies did not have any controls to\nensure that the percentage of high RP3 rankings and merit increases\nawarded to African-Americans was not influenced by other factors or by\ncomparing dissimilar employees. Other studies reviewing merit increases\ncontrolled for ranking received or for race and ranking but not for the\nactual factors that comprise the ranking or for the different job responsi-\nbilities that workers in different divisions may have. Five of Dr. Brad-\n\f18         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n   The district court found that \"the studies are deficient because they\nuse the EEO job groupings.\" During the hearing, Dr. Bradley testified\nthat job groups could contain numerous and diverse occupations. For\nexample, Dr. Bradley admitted under questioning that a single job\ngroup could contain 147 separate individual job titles and up to seven\nseparate pay grades. Dr. Bradley also testified that a single job group\ncould contain the following job titles: optician, counsel, physician,\nand psychologist. Furthermore, under the guidelines for managers\nusing the RP3 system to rate employees, the managers are instructed\nthat \"[t]he single most important component of any employee’s over-\nall performance involves the completion of their individual job-\nrelated responsibilities. This factor is weighted 75% of the total evalu-\nation.\" Those instructions also note that the \"[r]equirements of each\njob are often unique - there is not a single standard by which all\nemployees can be measured.\" According to Savannah River Site\nemployment policies, the RP3 ranking system is to be utilized to\ndetermine merit raises for employees within a single division. In 1998\nand 1999, the Savannah River Site had at least 18 separate divisions,\nand the RP3 system was to be used to rank employees for merit raises\nwithin, and not across, each division.\n\n   Dr. Bradley’s studies utilized various controls, i.e. job group, job\nperformance categories, division, EEO job category, adjusted years of\nservice, FLSA group. The studies, however, failed to compare simi-\n\nley’s studies involving RP3 rankings compared workers only by division,\nbut, within a division, there are many distinct types of positions with dif-\nferent responsibilities.\n   In Herold v. Hajoca Corp., 864 F.2d 317, 321-22 (4th Cir. 1988), we\nupheld the district court’s ruling to exclude statistical evidence that did\nnot compare the plaintiff with others who were similarly situated to the\nplaintiff. In Herold, plaintiff sought to introduce statistical evidence\nderived from the number of employees terminated in the company’s\nentire mid-Atlantic region in order to establish a violation of the ADEA.\nWe upheld the district court’s refusal to allow such \"region-wide statis-\ntics\" to be admitted. Instead, the district court permitted the plaintiff to\nintroduce statistical evidence derived only from the terminations of\nemployees at the defendant’s Staunton branch, where the plaintiff had\nbeen employed. 864 F.2d at 321-22.\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                 19\nlarly situated workers at the Savannah River Site. In Smith v. Virginia\nCommonwealth University, 84 F.3d 672, 676-77 (4th Cir. 1996) (en\nbanc), we noted that regression analysis utilized in the employment\ndiscrimination context \"must include all the major factors\" which\ninfluence the challenged action, such as ratings or pay. (emphasis in\noriginal). The plaintiffs in Smith were five male professors at Virginia\nCommonwealth University who brought a lawsuit under Title VII to\nchallenge pay raises given to female faculty members after the univer-\nsity conducted a salary equity study. 84 F.3d at 674. In Smith, we\nreversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment because the\ndistrict court relied on regression analyses that failed to include all\nmajor factors that influence the salaries of professors. 84 F.3d at 676.\nWe also explained that\n\n    [a]lso at issue is the fact that the study included male faculty\n    members who had returned from higher paying positions in\n    the VCU administration but kept the higher salary. The\n    study did not account for this salary differential. This,\n    according to the appellants, leads to an illogical comparison\n    involving an inflated pool of faculty members; eighty-five\n    percent of the faculty whose salaries were increased because\n    of prior service as administrators were male. An inflated\n    pool can undermine the validity of a statistical study to\n    determine imbalances.\n\n84 F.3d at 677 (footnote deleted). The study relied upon by the uni-\nversity was deficient because it failed to properly compare the salaries\nof male and female professors using the criteria that the university uti-\nlized to award raises. See Smith, 84 F.3d at 676-77 (noting that VCU\nused performance, productivity, and merit to award prior raises and\nthat these factors were not considered in the salary equity study).\n\n   The study used by VCU attempted to compare the salaries paid to\nmale and female professors. As professors, whether male or female,\nthe faculty at VCU was employed to teach and conduct research. The\nsalary equity study, though deficient, compared the salaries paid to\nmembers of the same profession. Dr. Bradley’s studies, however,\nevaluate the RP3 ranking process by using not a single job title for\ncomparison, such as professor, but by using job groups. As he admit-\nted during the evidentiary hearing, his study utilized results from a job\n\f20         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\ngroup, which could include diverse jobs such as counsel, optician,\nphysician, and psychologist. The ratings for performance as a counsel\nmay be different from those for a physician, even if the counsel and\nphysician being compared are of the same race.\n\n   We are of opinion and hold that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in excluding Dr. Bradley’s testimony based on his statisti-\ncal analysis. The analysis was based on comparisons that were not rel-\nevant to Miss Anderson’s claims. \"The usefulness of statistics\ndepends on the surrounding facts and circumstances.\" Carter v. Ball,\n33 F.3d 450, 456 (4th Cir. 1994) (citing Int’l Broth. of Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 340 (1977)).\n\n  The district judge stated briefly and clearly the reasons for her\ndecision, with which we agree:\n\n     THE COURT: All right. The court grants the motion in\n     limine. The court finds that the studies are deficient because\n     they use the EEO job groupings. And the witness has con-\n     ceded that the rating forms differ within the EEO job group-\n     ings, and he made no analysis of the difference in the rating\n     schemes for jobs within the EEO job groupings, nor what\n     the purpose of the EEO job groupings was from the point of\n     view of its decision to group certain kinds of job categories\n     together for that purpose.\n\n     That purpose seems to have nothing to do with actual job\n     performance or job requirements. And in order to evaluate\n     whether or not there is disparate impact in ratings, similarly\n     situated persons who are being rated must be compared.\n     And there is simply too much disparity in the groups that\n     have been used to control, and an absence of the use of a\n     control factor that would control for the actual job title or\n     the job duties.\n\n     And it does appear to me — and I believe the witness has\n     conceded that that could have been done and was not con-\n     trolled for, and for that reason the court grants the motion.\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               21\n                                  VI.\n\n   Miss Anderson also challenges the district court’s decision to\nexclude a report prepared by the Department of Energy. We review\na district court’s decision to exclude such evidence for abuse of dis-\ncretion. United States v. Gray, 852 F.2d 136, 139 (4th Cir. 1988). As\nwe noted above, a district court abuses its discretion if it makes an\nerror of law in deciding whether to admit or exclude evidence. See\nHunter, 281 F.3d at 150.\n\n   Anderson sought to introduce as evidence an assessment entitled\n\"Department of Energy’s Assessment of Westinghouse Savannah\nRiver Company’s Equal Employment Opportunity Human Resources\nand Employee Concerns Programs.\" The Department of Energy\nassessed the Savannah River Site’s equal employment opportunity\nand diversity programs in 2000 and submitted a draft of its assess-\nment to Westinghouse. The assessment is not final, and it is stamped\n\"DRAFT\" on the first page. Furthermore, the contents page and the\nfirst page of Section IX (Employee Concerns Programs), which is\nuncompleted, state that Section IX is \"to be completed later.\" As of\nMarch 2002, Westinghouse had not received a final version of the\nassessment.\n\n   The district court granted the defendants’ motion to exclude the\nassessment on the grounds that it suffered from multiple levels of\nhearsay and was not within the exception under Federal Rule of Evi-\ndence 803(8). The district court also noted that the assessment was a\ndraft, not a final report, and that the limited probative value of the\ndraft was \"far outweighed by the numerous trustworthiness concerns\n. . . coupled with the risk of unfair prejudice based on inclusion of\nallegations of events that may have nothing to do with a given Plain-\ntiff or Defendant.\"\n\n   Rule 803(8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence excepts from the\nhearsay rule reports compiled by \"public offices or agencies\" in com-\npliance with the office or agency’s duty under law \"unless the sources\nof information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthi-\nness.\" Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). In Distaff, Inc. v. Springfield Contracting\nCorp., 984 F.2d 108, 111 (4th Cir. 1993), we explained that an inves-\ntigative report may be admissible under Rule 803(8) if its contents are\n\f22         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\ntrustworthy. See also Zeus Enters., Inc. v. Alphin Aircraft, Inc., 190\nF.3d 238, 241 (4th Cir. 1999) (\"The admissibility of a public record\nspecified in the rule is assumed as a matter of course, unless there are\nsufficient negative factors to indicate a lack of trustworthiness, in\nwhich case it should not be admitted.\"). Courts may look to several\nfactors to determine if the report is admissible: \"(1) the timeliness of\nan investigation; (2) the special skill or experience of the official; and\n(3) possible motivational problems.\" Ellis v. Int’l Playtex, Inc., 745\nF.2d 292, 300-01 (4th Cir. 1984). The Distaff court noted several fac-\ntors which may reveal a lack of trustworthiness, namely \"unreliability,\ninadequate investigation, inadequate foundation for conclusions, (and)\ninvasion of the jury’s province.\" 984 F.2d at 111 (citing Weinstein,\nWeinstein’s Evidence, § 803(8)).\n\n   A review of the factors listed above reveals that the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in excluding the assessment. The Depart-\nment of Energy’s investigation began in 2000 and was not completed\nby March of 2002. The draft assessment contains multiple levels of\nhearsay as well as referring to a complaint from an individual who is\na plaintiff in a companion case to this lawsuit (one William Hall). The\nassessment does not have an adequate foundation for its conclusions.\nThe assessment team from the Department of Energy sought to docu-\nment employee perceptions about equal opportunity programs, but the\nteam only interviewed employees who responded to an open invita-\ntion sent by email. Those who were interviewed constituted less than\none percent of the workforce at the Savannah River Site. The assess-\nment team admitted in its report that it \"did not attempt to verify the\nperception of the employees\" who were interviewed. In analyzing the\nracial composition of interview panels, the assessment team based its\nstatistics on a review of 30 interview panels. During the 21-month\nperiod from which those 30 panels were chosen, the Savannah River\nSite utilized about 900 panels to select candidates for new positions.\nOf those 900 panels, the assessment team thus reviewed the racial\ncomposition of only 3.3% of the panels.\n\n   The admissibility of a report under Rule 803(8) is \"permissive and\nnot mandatory.\" United States v. Gray, 852 F.2d 136, 139 (4th Cir.\n1988). In Gray, we held that the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion by refusing to admit under Rule 803(8) an internal IRS report\nwhich was a \"tentative internal report.\" 852 F.2d at 139. Furthermore,\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               23\nthe risk of unfair prejudice from information contained in the IRS\nreport far outweighed its probative value. Based on the fact that the\nDepartment of Energy’s assessment was only a draft report and noting\nthe concerns which we have mentioned, which are evidence of the\nassessment’s lack of trustworthiness, we are of opinion and hold that\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the assess-\nment.\n\n                                 VII.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   Following the district court’s order denying class certification,\nMiss Anderson proceeded with her lawsuit individually. In her Fourth\nAmended Complaint, Miss Anderson claims that the RP3 ranking sys-\ntem and the CBPS have a disparate impact on black employees on the\nbasis of race. On appeal, Miss Anderson challenges the district court’s\ndecision granting summary judgment to the defendants on her dispa-\nrate impact claims.\n\n   We look first at Miss Anderson’s claim that the RP3 ranking sys-\ntem has a disparate impact on black employees. To establish a prima\nfacie case of disparate impact discrimination under Title VII, a plain-\ntiff must \"show that the facially neutral employment practice had a\nsignificantly discriminatory impact.\" Walls v. City of Petersburg, 895\nF.2d 188, 191 (4th Cir. 1990) (citing Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S.\n440, 446 (1982)). If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, \"the\nemployer must then demonstrate that ‘any given requirement [has] a\nmanifest relationship to the employment in question,’ in order to\navoid a finding of discrimination.\" Teal, 457 U.S. at 446-47 (quoting\nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, (1971)). \"Even in such a\ncase, however, the plaintiff may prevail, if he shows that the employer\nwas using the practice as a mere pretext for discrimination.\" Teal, 457\nU.S. at 447.\n\n   In establishing a prima facie violation of Title VII, a plaintiff may\nuse statistical evidence. See Walls, 895 F.2d at 191 (citing New York\nCity Transit Auth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 584 (1979)). In this case,\nthe district court excluded Dr. Bradley’s testimony based on statistical\nevidence which we have affirmed. In her brief, Miss Anderson\n\f24         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nacknowledges that she cannot prevail on her disparate impact claim\ninvolving the RP3 system without Dr. Bradley’s testimony. Miss\nAnderson did not address her RP3 disparate impact claim in her brief\nexcept to note that she wishes to pursue the claim if the district\ncourt’s evidentiary ruling on Dr. Bradley’s testimony is reversed. We\nhave affirmed the district court’s evidentiary ruling, and our affir-\nmance admittedly forecloses Miss Anderson’s chance for success on\nher RP3 disparate impact claim.3\n\n                                   B.\n\n   We next address Miss Anderson’s disparate impact claim involving\nthe CBPS. On appeal, she argues that the district court erred by con-\ncluding that she had not established causation and by requiring her to\nprove intentional discrimination instead of a disparate impact claim.\nWe review de novo her challenge to the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment. Williams, 370 F.3d at 428.\n\n   Miss Anderson contends that two aspects of the CBPS have a dis-\nparate impact on black employees. First, she challenges the stage in\nthe CBPS where applicants are selected for an interview, and, second,\nshe challenges the stage where the interview panel chooses the candi-\ndate for the position after an interview. These steps are listed as #9,\n#12, and #13 in the description of the CBPS found on pages 8-9 of\nthis opinion. Miss Anderson objects to the alleged subjectivity inher-\nent in these steps in the CBPS.\n\n   By her identification of these steps in the CBPS, we assume,\narguendo, that Miss Anderson has complied with the Court’s instruc-\ntion that a plaintiff in a disparate impact case must identify the spe-\ncific employment practice that is being challenged. See Watson v.\nFort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 994 (1988) (plurality opin-\nion). Next, Miss Anderson must prove causation. 487 U.S. at 994. She\nmust show that the above-mentioned practices caused a disparate\nimpact on black employees at the Site.\n  3\n   Miss Anderson withdrew her RP3 disparate impact claim after the\ndistrict court excluded Dr. Bradley’s testimony based on his statistical\nevidence. As a result, although she pursued this claim on appeal, her suc-\ncess is dependent on our decision on the evidentiary issue.\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                 25\n   To establish causation, Miss Anderson relies on statistical evidence\nprovided by Dr. Bradley about the CBPS. She argues that Dr. Brad-\nley’s statistical evidence ruled out the possibility that chance caused\na disparate impact on black employees. Dr. Bradley had analyzed the\npercentage of black employees who were successful under the CBPS\nat three stages: (1) selection as qualified for a position from all candi-\ndates who apply; (2) selected for an interview from all qualified can-\ndidates; and (3) selected for the position from all interviewed\ncandidates. Dr. Bradley compared the percentage of black employees\nwho actually succeeded at each level with the percentage which he\nexpected to succeed, based on the percentage of black employees at\nthe Site. He found that the percentage of black applicants who actu-\nally succeeded at each step was much lower than he expected. From\nthat evidence, which does not account for any other variables, Miss\nAnderson argues that causation is proven.\n\n   We do not agree. This evidence does not show that the reason\nblack applicants failed to proceed at the interview selection stage and\nposition selection stage was their race. Factors such as presentation\nin the interview, answers to interview questions, demeanor, and abil-\nity demonstrated in the interview of course entered into the judgment\nof the members of the panel as to the candidate who received a posi-\ntion that was being filled. And, at the interview selection stage, for\nexample, education and experience are two factors that Dr. Bradley’s\nanalysis fails to quantify.\n\n   Furthermore, at each of the two stages which Miss Anderson chal-\nlenges in the CBPS, the discretion of the person or panel making the\ndecision is not unfettered. At each step, the decision maker must look\nto the core competencies listed in the CBPS manual and the specific\nfunctional competencies, which are chosen specifically for each posi-\ntion. At the interview stage, a panel of three interviewers must evalu-\nate the candidate and must address each core and functional\ncompetency. The cases on which Miss Anderson relies to support her\nclaim that causation has been proven involves supervisors who pos-\nsessed unfettered discretion to make employment decisions. See Wat-\nson, 487 U.S. at 990 (noting that Title VII should apply to \"an\nemployer’s undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking\");\nCaridad v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 287 (2d Cir.\n1999) (noting that challenged promotion policy directed managers \"to\n\f26         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nhire the most qualified candidate, but no other instructions are given\"\nand that managers have unfettered discretion over hiring for certain\npositions); Mozee v. Am. Commercial Marine Serv. Co., 940 F.2d\n1036, 1042 n.6 (7th Cir. 1991) (explaining that promotion to the posi-\ntion of leadman, which was a prerequisite to a promotion to manage-\nment, \"was left entirely to management’s discretion, since it fell\noutside the seniority bidding system applicable to most hourly\nemployment positions\"); Rose v. Wells Fargo & Co., 902 F.2d 1417,\n1424 (9th Cir. 1990) (noting that \"Wells Fargo admits that the process\nof job elimination and restaffing was otherwise discretionary and sub-\njective\"). The decision makers at the Site were required to comply\nwith the CBPS, which, through the use of core and functional compe-\ntencies against which all applicants must be evaluated, limits the dis-\ncretion available to decisionmakers. Accordingly, the cases on which\nMiss Anderson relies are hardly supportive of her position, for the\nonly relevant complaint she makes to the process is that the decision\nmakers were white.\n\n   The district court did not bar from evidence Dr. Bradley’s conclu-\nsion that there might be evidence of disparate impact in two hiring\nstages — the interview stage and the selection stage — and correctly\nrejected the claim that his conclusion that the preparation of the list\nof eligibles by the Human Resources department might be subject to\na Title VII racial objection.\n\n   We assume for argument, without deciding, that Miss Anderson\nhas shown a prima facie case because the district court did not bar Dr.\nBradley’s conclusions as to disparate impact with respect to the inter-\nview stage and the selection stage. So the question is whether the\nproffered circumstantial evidence of discriminatory impact is suffi-\ncient to satisfy the McDonnell Douglas framework of proof. Murrell\nv. Ocean Mecca Motel, Inc., 262 F.3d 253, 257 (4th Cir. 2001). See\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Under this\nframework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination. Then the defendant must respond with evidence that it\nacted with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Murrell, 262 F.3d\nat 257. If the defendant makes this showing, then the plaintiff must\n\"present evidence to prove that the defendant’s articulated reason was\npretext for unlawful discrimination.\" Murrell, 262 F.3d at 257. \"Al-\nthough the evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under the McDon-\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                27\nnell Douglas framework, ‘[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier\nof fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plain-\ntiff remains at all time with the plaintiff.’\" Murrell, 262 F.3d at 257\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n   As the district court correctly stated regarding the 1997 failure to\npromote disparate treatment claim, Miss Anderson \"does not suggest\nthat the comments recorded on her interview form are false or mis-\nleading representations of her actual interview responses.\" Slip op. at\n5. Further, Miss Anderson failed to address her qualifications in terms\nof the disclosed weighted competency factors. Miss Anderson instead\nfocuses on her claimed higher satisfaction of the minimum qualifica-\ntions, such as her education level, an MBA as opposed to others with\nhigh school education, her performance of more years of administra-\ntive secretarial duties, and her numerous awards and recognition,\nwhich exceeded recognition received by other interviewees. The dis-\ntrict court found in its opinion that \"[w]hile these may be the criteria\nby which Anderson believes she should have been judged, Anderson\nhas not offered any evidence that WSRC or the particular individuals\nwho made up the CBPS panel have, at any time, applied such a set\nof standards.\" Slip op. at 6. For these reasons, pretext is simply not\nshown as there is no evidence to support it regarding the 1997 claim.\n\n   Miss Anderson similarly fails to point to any evidence that would\nsupport the conclusion that she deserved a higher rating on any of the\nareas evaluated for the 1998 promotion to administrative assistant.\nShe also fails to provide any evidence that the panel overlooked evi-\ndence of her abilities in the areas contained in her application. Rather,\nas with the 1997 application, she focuses on her supposed greater\nqualifications in terms of total years of employment or education.\nAgain, Miss Anderson has not proffered evidence to suggest that the\nlegitimate reason offered by WSRC for its hiring decision is pretex-\ntual.\n\n  So pretext has not been shown for either the 1997 or 1998 claim\nand the decision of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                                 VIII.\n\n   We turn next to Miss Anderson’s individual disparate treatment\nclaims. Her first claim relates to her December 1997 application for\n\f28         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nthe position of administrative assistant in the Environmental Restora-\ntion Division, Project Administration Department. Miss Anderson\nclaims that the defendants failed to promote her on the basis of her\nrace. Linda Clarke, a white employee, received the promotion instead\nof Miss Anderson. Her claim is a disparate treatment claim.\n\n   To prevail on a disparate treatment claim for failure to promote,\nMiss Anderson must establish that she was treated less favorably\nbecause of her race. See Int’l Broth. of Teamsters v. United States,\n431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977); Carter v. Ball, 33 F.3d 450, 456 n.7\n(4th Cir. 1994). In order to establish a prima facie case of racial dis-\ncrimination in promotions under § 1981 or Title VII, Miss Anderson\nmust follow the burden-shifting framework outlined by the Supreme\nCourt in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).\nSee Bryant v. Aiken Reg. Med. Ctrs. Inc., 333 F.3d 536, 544-45 (4th\nCir. 2003).4 Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, Miss Ander-\nson can establish a prima facie case by showing that (1) she is a mem-\nber of a protected group, (2) she applied for the position in question,\n(3) she was qualified for that position, and (4) the defendants rejected\nher application under circumstances that give rise to an inference of\nunlawful discrimination. See Bryant, 333 F.3d at 544-45; Carter, 33\nF.3d at 458. If a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts\n\"to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory rea-\nson\" for the decision not to promote. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S.\nat 802; see Bryant, 333 F.3d at 545. After the employer states a reason\nfor its decision, Miss Anderson has the opportunity to show that the\nstated reason is a pretext for discrimination, see McDonnell Douglas,\n411 U.S. at 804, and the trier of fact must determine if the plaintiff\nhas proved that the employer intentionally discriminated against her\nbecause of her race. Bryant, 333 F.3d at 545 (citing Fuller v. Phipps,\n67 F.3d 1137, 1141 (4th Cir. 1995)).\n\n   Miss Anderson applied for the position of administrative assistant\nin the Environmental Restoration Division, Project Administration\n  4\n    The Bryant court noted that \"[i]n failure-to-promote cases such as\nthis, ‘the framework of proof for disparate treatment claims . . . is the\nsame for actions brought under Title VII, or § 1981, or both statutes.’\"\nBryant, 333 F.3d at 545 n.3 (quoting Mallory v. Booth Refrig. Supply\nCo., 882 F.2d 908, 910 (4th Cir. 1989)).\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                29\nDepartment in November of 1997. She interviewed for the position\non December 15, 1997. The interview panel rated Miss Anderson on\nthe six core competencies (teamwork, leadership, communications,\nemployee development, business results, and self management) and\nfour functional competencies (customer focus, flexibility, problem\nsolving, and professionalism). Based on her interview responses, the\npanel gave Miss Anderson a total consensus rating of 136. The\nemployee who was promoted, Linda Clarke, a white woman, received\na total consensus rating of 190.\n\n   Miss Anderson’s primary contentions on appeal are that she had\nmore education and more experience at the Savannah River Site than\nMrs. Clarke and that Miss Anderson’s consensus rating was low\nbased on her work evaluations and numerous awards and commenda-\ntions. The interview panel chose Linda Clarke to receive the promo-\ntion because she was the \"[b]est candidate based on quals. and\ninterview.\" Anderson must show that this reason was a pretext for\nracial discrimination. See St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S.\n502, 511 (1993). In Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,\n530 U.S. 133, 147 (2000), the Supreme Court explained that a plain-\ntiff may establish pretext by proving that the defendant’s explanation\nfor an employment decision is \"unworthy of credence\" or that the\ndefendant’s explanation is false. The Reeves Court also noted that\n\"[i]n appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer\nfrom the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling\nto cover up a discriminatory purpose.\" 530 U.S. at 147. We followed\nReeves in Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Medical Center, Inc., 290\nF.3d 639, 648-49 & n.4 (4th Cir. 2002), and determined that a plain-\ntiff in a failure to promote case is not necessarily required to meet the\ntest in Evans v. Technologies Applications & Service Co., 80 F.3d\n954, 960 (4th Cir. 1996), that a plaintiff \"must establish that she was\nthe better qualified candidate for the position sought.\" Evans, 80 F.3d\nat 960 (citing Gairola v. Va. Dep’t of Gen. Servs., 753 F.32d 1281,\n1287 (4th Cir. 1985); Young v. Lehman, 748 F.2d 194, (4th Cir.\n1984)).\n\n  Dennis instructs that we should not rigidly apply the Evans stan-\ndard for comparing the plaintiff’s qualifications with those of the per-\nson who received the promotion, but we may also consider the\nveracity of the reasons, annunciated by the employer, why the plain-\n\f30         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\ntiff did not receive the promotion. Dennis, 290 F.3d at 648-649 & n.4.\n\"Reeves plainly instructs us to apply a contrary approach [to Evans]\nby affirming that it is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ulti-\nmate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer’s expla-\nnation.\" Dennis, 290 F.3d at 648 n.4 (citing Reeves, 530 U.S. at 147).\n\n   Miss Anderson cannot establish her own criteria for judging her\nqualifications for the promotion. She must compete for the promotion\nbased on the qualifications established by her employer. See Beall v.\nAbbott Labs., 130 F.3d 614, 620 (1997) (\"[A]bsent evidence of retal-\niatory motive, we leave to the employer’s discretion the method of\nevaluating an employee’s job performance.\"); see also Jiminez v.\nMary Washington Coll., 57 F.3d 369, 383 (4th Cir. 1995) (\"The cru-\ncial issue in a Title VII action is an unlawfully discriminatory motive\nfor a defendant’s conduct, not the wisdom or folly of its business\njudgment.\").\n\n  We assume, arguendo, that Miss Anderson has stated a prima facie\ncase of racial discrimination. The question on her first claim for fail-\nure to promote thus turns on the issue of pretext. In order to prevail,\nMiss Anderson must direct us to evidence which indicates that the\ndefendants’ stated reasons for promoting Mrs. Clarke over Miss\nAnderson were a pretext for discrimination.\n\n   Miss Anderson had an executive secretary diploma and a bachelor\nof science degree in human resource management at the time she\napplied for the position of administrative assistant in the Environmen-\ntal Restoration Division, Project Administration Department. She was\nclose to finishing her masters in business administration. The mini-\nmum educational requirements for the position were a high school\ndiploma and eight to twelve years of practical experience in a busi-\nness or administrative area, or an associate degree in a nontechnical\nor business discipline with at least four to seven years of practical\nexperience in a business or administrative area, or a bachelor’s degree\nin a nontechnical or business discipline and at least one to three years\nof practical experience in business, administrative, budgeting, or pro-\ngram planning. Miss Anderson exceeded the educational require-\nments, and she had more education than Linda Clarke, who only had\na high school diploma. However, educational qualifications, while\nlisted in the minimum requirements section of the administrative\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.              31\nassistant competency based posting system job description, were not\namong the factors that the interview panel used to determine each\napplicant’s consensus rating. As a result of the defendants’ decision\nto base the promotion decision on the core and functional competen-\ncies listed in the job description and not on the educational levels of\napplicants, Miss Anderson cannot rely on her educational background\nto establish that the defendants’ reasons for promoting Mrs. Clarke\nwas a pretext for discrimination. See Beall, 130 F.3d at 620; Jiminez,\n57 F.3d at 383. Miss Anderson may not choose the areas in which she\nwants to compete with Mrs. Clarke for the promotion; those areas are\nfor the employer’s choosing.\n\n   Miss Anderson contends that she has more experience at the\nSavannah River Site than Mrs. Clarke. At the time of her application\nfor promotion to administrative assistant in the Environmental Resto-\nration Division, Project Administration Department, Mrs. Clarke had\n15 years of secretarial experience prior to beginning work at the\nSavannah River Site. After being hired at the Site, she had seven\nyears of experience at the time she applied for the position. In con-\ntrast, Miss Anderson had only eight years of experience as a secretary\nat the Site. While Miss Anderson, with seven years of secretarial\nexperience and twelve as a typist or stenographer, has a longer total\ntenure at the Site than Mrs. Clarke, she cannot choose the criteria by\nwhich an employer makes a promotion decision. See Beall, 130 F.3d\nat 619-20. Regarding experience, the CBPS posting of the position\nexplained that experience was a minimum requirement, and not a\ndeciding factor in the application process.\n\n   Furthermore, the deciding factor in the promotion decision was the\nrating for core and functional competencies that each applicant who\nwas interviewed received. Mrs. Clarke received the highest score,\n190, and Miss Anderson received the second-lowest score, 136. A\ncomparison of the two rating forms, compiled by the same interview\npanel, indicates that the panel found Mrs. Clarke to be the superior\ncandidate. Miss Anderson’s attempts to show that the CBPS system,\nwhich creates the consensus rating system upon which the promotion\ndecision was based, discriminates against black employees also are\nunsuccessful. This contention is based on Dr. Bradley’s study com-\nparing the percentage of black employees who are successful at three\nseparate steps in the CBPS to the expected percentage of successful\n\f32         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nblack candidates based on the total percentage of black employees at\nthe Site. As we discussed previously, this study fails to consider the\nvarious factors that are involved in a promotion decision. It does not\nprove that the CBPS discriminates against black employees on the\nbasis of race, and Miss Anderson cannot use it to avoid summary\njudgment on her 1997 failure to promote claim. We are of opinion\nthat the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the\ndefendants on this claim.\n\n   Miss Anderson’s next claim involves her application in 1998 for a\npromotion to administrative assistant in the Business Development\nand Community Outreach Division. Miss Anderson was not selected\nfor an interview, and a white woman, Mrs. Brenda Pearson, was\nselected to receive the promotion. Miss Anderson contends that she\ndid not receive the promotion due to her race.\n\n   The issue again turns on pretext as we assume, arguendo, that Miss\nAnderson has established a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\nOn appeal, Miss Anderson contends that she established pretext\nbecause she has a stronger educational background than Mrs. Pearson,\nthat the defendants pre-selected Mrs. Pearson for the position, and\nthat the ratings given to Miss Anderson in the interview selection\nstage evidence discrimination because they do not correspond to Miss\nAnderson’s performance reviews. Miss Anderson also reiterates the\ncontention, which we have rejected, that the CBPS discriminates\nagainst black employees seeking promotions at the Site.\n\n   While Miss Anderson has a stronger educational background than\nMrs. Pearson, education is listed as a minimum requirement for the\nposition and is not a deciding factor in determining who receives the\npromotion. Mrs. Pearson received the promotion because she had a\nhigher consensus rating on the core and functional competencies for\nthe position than Miss Judy Burch, the other employee interviewed\nfor the promotion. The selection of applicants for interviews also was\nbased on an evaluation of core and functional competencies, not on\neducational backgrounds. As we noted before, Miss Anderson may\nnot choose the criteria on which she wishes to compete with Mrs.\nPearson for the promotion. Moreover, she cannot establish pretext by\nrelying on criteria of her choosing when the employer based its deci-\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               33\nsion on other grounds. See Beall, 130 F.3d at 620; Jiminez, 57 F.3d\nat 383.\n\n   Miss Anderson next contends that she established pretext by show-\ning that Miss Virginia Wolfe, the hiring manager for the 1998 promo-\ntion in the Business Development and Community Outreach Division,\npreselected Mrs. Pearson for the promotion. At the time the promo-\ntion decision was made, Mrs. Pearson was a secretary who reported\nto Miss Wolfe, along with eight other individuals. The functions of\nthe position for which Miss Anderson applied were, prior to the selec-\ntion of Mrs. Pearson, being performed by Mrs. Pearson in her position\nas a secretary reporting to Miss Wolfe.\n\n   The argument that a supervisor may have preselected an employee\nfor a promotion \"is not sufficient evidence for jurors reasonably to\nconclude\" that the defendants’ explanation for hiring Mrs. Pearson\nwas prextext. Mackey v. Shalala, 360 F.3d 463, 468-69 (4th Cir.\n2004). \"If one employee was unfairly preselected for the position, the\npreselection would work to the detriment of all applicants for the job,\nblack and white alike.\" Blue v. United States Dep’t of the Army, 914\nF.2d 525, 541 (4th Cir. 1990). The Blue court noted that while prese-\nlection may establish that an employee was \"unfairly treated, it does\nnot by itself prove racial discrimination.\" 914 F.2d at 541 (citing\nCasillas v. United States Navy, 735 F.2d 338, 344 (9th Cir. 1984)\n(\"Title VII does not ensure the best will be selected—only that the\nselection process will be free from impermissible discrimination.\"))\n\n   Miss Anderson’s final contention regarding the 1998 promotion is\nthat the ratings given to her in the interview selection stage establish\npretext because they do not reflect the positive evaluation she\nreceived during her performance reviews. Miss Anderson’s argument\nasks us to review the process by which the defendants select employ-\nees for promotion. Miss Anderson has not introduced any evidence\nthat her performance reviews were submitted to the hiring manager\nwho selected applicants for an interview. Without proof that the hir-\ning manager had access to Miss Anderson’s performance reviews,\nthere is no basis to conclude that the hiring manager was even aware\nof the positive comments Miss Anderson had received on her perfor-\nmance evaluations. Furthermore, the performance evaluation is a\nreview of an employee’s performance in her current position, while\n\f34         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nthe process of selecting a person for a promotion involves a consider-\nation of how that employee will perform in a different position. In\nother words, the performance evaluation and the interview selection\nstage, which involves an analysis of how the applicant meets the core\nand functional competencies of the position that is open, are not inter-\nchangeable. We do not sit as a \"super-personnel department weighing\nthe prudence of employment decisions\" made by the defendants.\nDeJarnette v. Corning, Inc., 133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir. 1998). We\ncannot require that different supervisors within the same organization\nmust reach the same conclusion on an employee’s qualifications and\nabilities.\n\n  We are of opinion that the district court did not err in granting sum-\nmary judgment to the defendants on Miss Anderson’s 1998 failure to\npromote claim.\n\n  Miss Anderson’s final disparate treatment failure to promote claim\ncenters on her failure to receive a promotion in place from SGL 28\nSOP to SGL 30 SOP. At the time she sought this promotion, she was\nan administrative assistant in the university relations group within the\nchemicals hydrogen technology group. Again, the issue turns on the\nquestion of pretext.\n\n   Miss Anderson must establish that there is a genuine issue of mate-\nrial fact as to the defendants’ stated reason for why she did not\nreceive a promotion in place to SGL 30 SOP. The defendants have\nintroduced affidavits from three compensation analysts who recom-\nmended that Miss Anderson’s position remain a SGL 28 SOP position\ninstead of a SGL 30 SOP position as of 1999. Miss Anderson does\nnot direct us to any evidence which suggests that these analysts\nreached their conclusions by improperly considering race instead of\nthe actual responsibilities of Miss Anderson’s position. Miss Ander-\nson attempts to rely on her own affidavit to create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact, but nothing in her affidavit controverts the analysts’\nanalysis of her position or suggests that the analysts were motivated\nby racism to refuse to qualify her position as a SGL 30 SOP position.\n\n  Miss Anderson attempts to establish pretext by comparing herself\nwith two white employees who received promotions in place within\ntwo years of entering their current position. This argument fails to\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               35\nestablish pretext. Miss Anderson seeks to compare herself to employ-\nees who hold positions that are dissimilar to her own. The first white\nemployee, Craig Stripling, is an associate engineer who was promoted\nfrom SGL 28 to SGL 30 after working as an associate technical sup-\nport specialist for less than two years. The second, Michelle Trill, a\nhuman resources consultant, was promoted six times between 1989\nand 1995. These two white employees worked in separate divisions\nfrom Miss Anderson and had different responsibilities. Their promo-\ntions could be based on factors that may not be present in Miss\nAnderson’s position. The fact that the white employees received pro-\nmotions and Miss Anderson did not, when the job requirements and\nresponsibilities for the white employees are different from Miss\nAnderson’s, does not establish pretext.\n\n   Miss Anderson further claims that the rapid promotions of these\ntwo white employees occurred in violation of a Site policy that\nemployees do not receive pay increases unless they have been in their\ncurrent position for more than two years. Miss Anderson bases this\nclaim on a statement made to her by her manager that \"promotions\nwere not usually given until an employee had been in a position for\ntwo to four years.\" This statement, which contains the qualifier \"usu-\nally,\" coupled with the fact that Miss Trill and Stripling were pro-\nmoted without two years of experience in their positions, does not\nestablish pretext. Miss Anderson’s manager informed her of the usual\npolicy, but his statement reflects the fact that exceptions do exist.\n\n   Miss Anderson did not receive a promotion in place because her\njob responsibilities did not warrant such an increase. She has not\nshown us any evidence which suggests that this reason was a pretext\nor from which a jury could infer pretext. See Bryant, 333 F.3d at 544\n(noting that a jury could infer discrimination based on \"the lack of\nany real reason to deny Bryant the job\"). In this case, the defendant\nhas stated a reason why Miss Anderson did not receive a promotion,\nand Miss Anderson has been unable to controvert it.\n\n  We are of opinion that the district court did not err in granting sum-\nmary judgment to the defendants on Miss Anderson’s disparate treat-\nment failure to promote in place claim.\n\f36         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n                                   IX.\n\n   Miss Anderson appeals the district court’s decision denying the\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On appeal, she argues that\nthe district court erred by failing to certify two subclasses, one com-\nposed of black Site employees who were discriminated against under\nthe CBPS and one composed of black Site employees who were dis-\ncriminated against under the RP3 system. Miss Anderson is not a\nmember of either of the two subclasses. As we have discussed above,\nall of Miss Anderson’s claims, whether based on a disparate impact\nor disparate treatment theory, are without merit, and the district court\nproperly granted summary judgment to the defendants on each of the\nclaims. Miss Anderson voluntarily has dismissed the one claim which\nremained after the district court ruled on the defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment, the disparate treatment merit pay claim. Accord-\ningly, Miss Anderson no longer has any valid claims pending in this\ncase.In Cox v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 471 F.2d 13 (4th Cir. 1972),\nand later in Goodman v. Schlesinger, 584 F.2d 1325 (4th Cir. 1978),\nwe considered almost the same issue.\n\n   In Cox, the plaintiff alleged that he was subject to unlawful dis-\ncrimination under the employment practices of the defendant. 471\nF.2d at 14. The plaintiff brought both individual and class action\nclaims. The district court proceeded to try the plaintiff’s individual\nclaims in a bench trial with an advisory jury without first ruling on\nthe plaintiff’s class action claims. After the bench trial, the district\ncourt dismissed the plaintiff’s individual claims after concluding that\nthe defendant had not practiced illegal discrimination. 471 F.2d at 14.\nThe district court then dismissed the plaintiff’s class action claims\nbecause the plaintiff, without any individual claims, was not a proper\nclass representative. The plaintiff appealed both rulings to this court.\n\n   On appeal, we affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the plain-\ntiff’s individual claims. 471 F.2d at 14-15. Turning next to the plain-\ntiff’s class claims, we noted the awkwardness of remanding the class\nclaims to the district court where the plaintiff, although \"finally\nadjudged not to be a member of the class he seeks to represent,\"\nwould nonetheless continue to prosecute the class claims in the dis-\ntrict court upon remand. 471 F.2d at 15-16. We remanded the class\nclaims to the district court and instructed the district court to hold the\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                   37\ndocket for the class claims open in case any other plaintiffs presented\nproper claims against the defendant. 471 F.2d at 16.\n\n   In Goodman, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for\nclass certification on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not comply\nwith the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure. 584 F.2d at 1327. At trial on the plaintiffs’ individual claims,\nthe district court found against the plaintiffs and denied their individ-\nual claims. 584 F.2d at 1329-1331. On appeal, the plaintiffs chal-\nlenged the district court’s rulings on both the denial of class\ncertification and the dismissal of the individual claims.\n\n   We affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ individual claims and\nnoted that the plaintiffs \"have had their day in court\" to pursue their\nindividual claims. 584 F.2d at 1331. Turning to the certification issue,\nthe court determined that the district court acted prematurely in\ndeclining to certify the class action because the district court ruled on\nthe certification question prior to the completion of discovery. 584\nF.2d at 1332. Following Cox, in Goodman we remanded the class\naction issue to the district court but instructed that the plaintiffs in the\nappeal might not pursue the class claims on remand. Instead, the dis-\ntrict court should retain the case on the docket for a reasonable time\nto \"permit a proper plaintiff or plaintiffs, with grievances similar to\n[the plaintiffs on appeal], in person, to present himself to prosecute\nthe action as class representative. Goodman, 584 F.2d at 1332-1333.\nWe followed the procedure in Goodman and Cox again in Simmons\nv. Brown, 611 F.2d 65 (4th Cir. 1979).\n\n   On appeal, Miss Anderson seeks to be a class representative for\ntwo separate sub-classes based on the defendants’ use of the CBPS\nand RP3 systems. Her claims have not been mooted, but instead have\nbeen adjudged to be without merit. Miss Anderson has no valid\nclaims which give her \"the same interest\" and cause her to \"suffer the\nsame injury\" as the proposed class members she seeks to represent.\nSee E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys., Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403\n(1977).\n\n   The claim of Miss Anderson on appeal with respect to the denial\nof certification of a class action is clearly stated:\n\f38         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n     Anderson appeals the District Court’s denial of certification\n     of two subclasses of African-American employees with\n     claims based on (1) the CBPS and (2) the RP3.\n\n   With respect to the RP3 claim, there is no indication or claim of\nany successful prosecution of that claim without the rejected testi-\nmony of Dr. Bradley, who was examined in open court by the district\njudge and the parties. The denial of the district court to certify a class\naction with respect to the RP3 procedure is accordingly affirmed.\n\n   With respect to the CBPS claim, we express no opinion on the\nquestion of whether or not some part of Miss Anderson’s claim relat-\ning to the administration of that system of career advancement or job\navailability may be a colorable class claim, although none has been\nshown here. We say this because of the decision of the district court\nwith respect to Dr. Bradley’s testimony in which it denied the motion\nto exclude the testimony \"from the qualified to the interview stage,\nand from the interview stage to the selection stage,\" but it granted the\nmotion to exclude the testimony \"from the pool stage to the qualified\nstage.\" Stated simply, the court held that the evidence did not show\nthat the Human Resources Department might have discriminated in\npreparing the list of those qualified for job openings but that the sta-\ntistical evidence might be admissible if it tended to show the possibil-\nity of discrimination in selecting those applicants who would be\ninterviewed and in selecting the person for the job from among those\ninterviewed.\n\n   While we express no opinion on whether or not the class action\nmay fail for want of commonality or typicality, we remand to the dis-\ntrict court the question of whether or not a class action should be per-\nmitted to proceed with respect to the \"qualified to the interview stage,\nand from the interview stage to the selection stage.\" Upon remand, if\na proper plaintiff or plaintiffs with grievances similar to those of Miss\nAnderson with respect to that discrete portion of the CBPS procedure\npresents himself to prosecute, himself, as a class representative, the\ndistrict court should then decide whether a class action is maintain-\nable and whether the then named plaintiff should represent the class.\nWe express no opinion as to the weight, if any, to give Dr. Bradley’s\ntestimony or whether it is admissible. If no representative plaintiff so\ncomes forward within a reasonable time, then the district court should\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               39\nstrike the class action from the calendar and enter a final dismissal\nthereof. Goodman, 584 F.2d at 1332-33.\n\n                                  X.\n\n   Accordingly, as stated above, the district court’s decision excluding\nDr. Bradley’s expert RP3 testimony, excluding the Department of\nEnergy draft assessment, and granting summary judgment to the\ndefendants on Miss Anderson’s individual disparate impact and dispa-\nrate treatment claims are affirmed. The denial of a class action with\nrespect to the RP3 procedure is affirmed, as is the denial of a class\naction with respect to the CBPS procedure, with the exception of that\npart of the CBPS procedure noted just above. This action is remanded\nto the district court to keep the same on the docket for a reasonable\ntime, with instructions to determine if there is another plaintiff who\nwishes to maintain a class action under the principles established in\nCox and Goodman we have referred to.\n\n                                        AFFIRMED IN PART,\n                                         VACATED IN PART,\n                          AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n   I am pleased to concur in Judge Widener’s thorough and well rea-\nsoned opinion insofar as it affirms the district court’s judgment. But\nI cannot agree with a remand \"to determine if there is another plaintiff\nwho wishes to maintain a class action.\"\n\n   Because the plaintiff has no cognizable claim, she is not in a posi-\ntion to represent a class of others because either her claims are not\ntypical of the others or, if they are, the others’ claims likewise have\nno merit.\n\n   The problem that Judge Widener raises in Part IX would, in my\njudgment, be resolved just as well by some other plaintiff, not in this\ncase, alleging his or her own claim and seeking to prosecute it as a\nclass action. As for this case, I would consider it ended with our opin-\nion affirming the judgment of the district court.\n\f40          ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n   By remanding this case to the district court with no plaintiff, we\ncan only be inviting new claims — different from those that we have\nrejected in this case — to be filed on behalf of a new plaintiff and\nunspecified others. This is not the situation where a plaintiff’s claims\nhave been dismissed on a technical deficiency, and we would be\nallowing another plaintiff without that deficiency to continue the case.\nRather, we have a case where the plaintiff’s claims were dismissed\nbecause the claims themselves were deficient. In short, there is noth-\ning to perpetuate on remand.\n\n  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part IX and the remand\nremedy contained in Part X. Otherwise, I concur in this fine opinion.\n\nGREGORY, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n\n   Although I agree with most of the majority’s analysis, I write sepa-\nrately because I cannot concur in the disparate impact analysis con-\ntained in part VII(B). There, the majority affirms a grant of summary\njudgment against Ms. Anderson on her disparate impact claim despite\nthe fact that she produced evidence showing a statistically significant\nvariation between the number of African-Americans who apply and\nthe number who are successful at both the second and third stages of\nthe CBPS. The majority first finds that because Ms. Anderson’s evi-\ndence challenging the subjective nature of the second and third stages\nof the CBPS failed to control for all subjective variables potentially\ntaken into account in the interview and hiring decisions, she failed to\nestablish the causation element of her prima facie burden. Second, the\nmajority finds that even if Ms. Anderson had in fact satisfied her\nprima facie burden, her claims would fail because she cannot make\nthe requisite McDonnell Douglas showing that Westinghouse’s legiti-\nmate non-discriminatory rationale was mere pretext for a racially dis-\ncriminatory decision.\n\n   Because I cannot agree with either of these contentions, I respect-\nfully dissent from that particular part of the majority opinion.\n\n                                   I.\n\n     Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1991:\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                 41\n    It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\n    —\n\n    (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or\n    otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect\n    to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n    employment, because of such individual’s race, color, reli-\n    gion, sex, or national origin; or\n\n    (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or appli-\n    cants for employment in any way which would deprive or\n    tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities\n    or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n    because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\n    national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (2005). From inception, it was clear that the act\ncovered cases of disparate treatment — where one party was inten-\ntionally discriminated against by an employer on the basis of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin. See Int. Bhd. of Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977)(\"Undoubtedly disparate\ntreatment was the most obvious evil Congress had in mind when it\nenacted Title VII.\").\n\n   However, in the seminal case of Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401\nU.S. 424, 431 (1971), the Court held that \"[t]he Act proscribes not\nonly overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but\ndiscriminatory in operation.\" See Peters v. Jenney, 327 F.3d 307, 321\nn.17 (4th Cir. 2003) (\"Title VII prohibits practices that are not inten-\ntionally discriminatory but that have a disparate impact on members\nof a particular racial group.\"). As amended in 1991, Title VII now\nexplicitly recognizes disparate impact claims. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k).\nSection 2000e-2(k) states as follows:\n\n    (1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on disparate\n    impact is established under this subchapter only if—\n\n    (i) a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses\n    a particular employment practice that causes a disparate\n\f42         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n     impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national\n     origin and the respondent fails to demonstrate that the chal-\n     lenged practice is job related for the position in question and\n     consistent with business necessity; or\n\n     (ii) the complaining party makes the demonstration\n     described in subparagraph (C) with respect to an alternative\n     employment practice and the respondent refuses to adopt\n     such alternative employment practice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k).\n\n   Similar to its analysis of disparate treatment, the Supreme Court\nhas laid out a burden shifting scheme for disparate impact actions. See\nWatson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 994-95 (1988).\nUnder the disparate impact burden-shifting scheme, the first step is\nfor the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact. See\nid. at 994. To make this prima facie showing, a plaintiff must (1)\nidentify a specific policy or practice, (2) demonstrate that a disparity\nexists, and (3) establish a causal relationship between the two. See id.\nat 994-95. Upon successfully presenting a prima facie case, the bur-\nden then shifts to the employer to \"demonstrate that the challenged\npractice is job related for the position in question and consistent with\nbusiness necessity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(a)(i); see Walls v. City\nof Petersburg, 895 F.2d 188, 191 (4th Cir. 1990)(\"[T]he employer\nmust then demonstrate that ‘any given requirement [has] a manifest\nrelationship to the employment in question,’ in order to avoid a find-\ning of discrimination.\"). Finally, even if the employer makes a suffi-\ncient showing that the challenged practice is \"job related,\" the\nplaintiff may prevail by showing the existence of an equally effective\nalternative practice that eliminates the disparate impact and the\nemployer refuses to adopt this alternative. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(a)(2); see Allen v. City of Chicago, 351 F.3d 306, 311-12 (7th\nCir. 2003)(\"If the defendant makes this showing, plaintiffs can still\nprevail by demonstrating that an alternative employment practice\nexists, and the defendant refuses to adopt it.\").\n\n                                   II.\n\n   Contrary to the majority, I believe that Ms. Anderson did in fact\nsatisfy her prima facie burden for a Title VII disparate impact claim.\nTherefore, I will address each step of the analysis in turn.\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                  43\n                                   A.\n\n   As noted earlier, the first step in establishing a prima facie case is\nthe identification of a specific policy or practice. Here, Ms. Anderson\nchallenges the second and third stages of the Competency Based Post-\ning System (\"CBPS\")1 as having a disparate impact on African-\nAmerican employees. Ms. Anderson specifically challenges the sub-\njective decision-making involved in each stage. The majority \"as-\nsumes arguendo\" that by challenging these stages Ms. Anderson\nidentified a specific employment practice.\n\n   In Watson, the Court addressed the issue of whether a disparate\nimpact analysis could properly be applied to subjective criteria.2 See\nWatson, 487 U.S. at 989. There, the Court held that \"subjective or dis-\ncretionary employment practices may be analyzed under the disparate\nimpact approach in appropriate cases.\" Id. at 991. \"We are persuaded\nthat our decisions in Griggs and succeeding cases could largely be\nnullified if disparate impact analysis were applied only to standard-\nized selection practices.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 989. The Court contin-\nued on to conclude that:\n\n     If an employer’s undisciplined system of subjective\n     decision-making has precisely the same effects as a system\n     pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination, it is\n     difficult to see why Title VII’s proscription against discrimi-\n     natory actions should not apply. In both circumstances, the\n     employer’s practices may be said to \"adversely affect [an\n     individual’s] status as an employee, because of such individ-\n     ual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C.\n     § 2000e-2(a)(2).\n  1\n    Specifically, Ms. Anderson challenged steps #9, #12, #13 of the\nCBPS.\n  2\n    In Watson, the Court noted that its disparate impact jurisprudence had\nalways involved cases in which standardized employment tests or criteria\nwere challenged. Id. at 988. For example, in Griggs the Court faced chal-\nlenges to high school diploma requirements and aptitude tests. Griggs,\n401 U.S. 301-02. Similarly, in Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S.\n405, 427 (1975), the Court faced challenges to aptitude tests. Finally, in\nConnecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 445 (1982), the Court faced chal-\nlenges to written examinations.\n\f44         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nId. at 990-991.\n\n   In this case, I would find that Ms. Anderson did in fact satisfy the\nfirst element of her prima facie burden. Ms. Anderson challenged the\nsecond and third stages of the CBPS system, both of which entail an\ninterview panel subjectively rating qualified candidates across a num-\nber of subjective criteria. The second stage is a screening stage, where\nthe applications of applicants who are found to meet the minimum\nrequirements by the Human Resources department are forwarded to\nthe manager of the department with the opening. That person, either\nby themself or in conjunction with two others, then screens all the\napplications with \"core competencies\" (teamwork, leadership, com-\nmunications, employee development, business results and self man-\nagement) and \"functional competencies\" in mind, to find the most\nqualified candidates to interview for the position. The third stage of\nthe process involves the actual interviews of those candidates\nselected. Interviews are conducted by a three-person panel, during\nwhich each member of the panel evaluates the candidate in writing\naccording to the above criteria and any other relevant characteristics.\nAfter all interviews are conducted, the panel then selects who it\nbelieves is the best person for the position.\n\n    Ms. Anderson is not required to challenge a more specific aspect\nof the hiring process, particularly when she is challenging a subjective\nprocess. In Rose v. Wells Fargo & Co., 902 F.2d 1417, 1420, 1424-\n25 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit held that where \"[e]mployment\ndecisions as to which jobs would be eliminated and as to who would\nfill the remaining positions was essentially left to the discretion of the\nvarious bank departments,\" such a policy was a specific employment\npractice subject to disparate impact analysis, even where the manag-\ners were instructed to consider factors such as longevity and perfor-\nmance. Similarly, in this case, while those making the decisions in the\nsecond and third stages of the CBPS were instructed to evaluate can-\ndidates according to certain qualities, whether the applicants showed\nany aptitude for the guideline qualities was an entirely subjective\nevaluation. After all, how does one truly quantify or measure \"team-\nwork\" or \"communications\" without making a wholly subjective\nassessment?\n\n  In its attempt to distinguish cases such as Watson and Rose, I\nbelieve that the majority overstates the level to which the discretion\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                  45\npresent in this case was cabined by the process. Focusing on the Wat-\nson Court’s language describing subjective employment practices as\n\"unchecked discretion\" and as an \"undisciplined system of subjective\ndecision making,\" the majority argues that because the discretion in\nthis case was not unfettered, the holdings of Watson and Rose are not\napplicable here. The majority finds support for this position in the fact\nthat the decision makers were instructed to consider core and func-\ntional competencies when making their decisions. However, the\nmajority’s focus on the Watson Court’s language describing subjec-\ntive employment practices as \"unchecked discretion\" and as an \"un-\ndisciplined system of subjective decision making,\" is misplaced. The\ncrux of the Watson decision is that \"disparate impact analysis is in\nprinciple no less applicable to subjective employment criteria than to\nobjective or standardized tests\" because \"[i]n either case, a facially\nneutral practice, adopted without discriminatory intent, may have\neffects that are indistinguishable from intentionally discriminatory\npractices.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 990. Later in the Watson opinion, the\nCourt then repeated this position, stating \"[i]f an employer’s undisci-\nplined system of subjective decision making has precisely the same\neffects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimina-\ntion, it is difficult to see why Title VII’s proscription against discrimi-\nnatory actions should not apply.\" Id. at 990-91. The clear focus of the\nWatson opinion is not the degree to which subjective discretion is\nunfettered, but instead the fact that both objective and subjective\ncriteria can have deleterious effects that are indistinguishable from\nintentionally discriminatory practices. That was the reason the Court\nconcluded \"that subjective or discretionary employment practices may\nbe analyzed under the disparate impact approach in appropriate\ncases.\" Id. at 991.\n\n   Because I believe that the challenged practices are undisputably\nsubjective in nature, I see no reason not to apply the rule of Watson\nin this case, and find that Ms. Anderson identified a specific employ-\nment practice.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   Ms. Anderson was next required to show a causal nexus between\nthe challenged practice and the disparity. The statute itself mandates\nthat the plaintiff demonstrate that the employer \"uses a particular\n\f46         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact.\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(k); see Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642,\n657 (1989)(\"a Title VII plaintiff does not make out a case of disparate\nimpact simply by showing that, ‘at the bottom line,’ there is racial\nimbalance in the work force. As a general matter, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that it is the application of a specific or particular\nemployment practice that has created the disparate impact under\nattack.\").\n\n   As an initial matter, it is well recognized that statistical evidence\nmay be employed in disparate impact cases to show the existence of\na disparity. See New York City Transit Auth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568,\n584 (1979); Walls, 895 F.2d at 191 (\"A plaintiff may use statistical\nevidence to establish a prima facie violation of Title VII.\"). As the\nCourt noted in Watson, the term \"disparity\" has \"never been framed\nin terms of any mathematical formula.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 994-95.\nFurther, the Court has never \"suggested that any particular number of\nstandard deviations can determine whether a plaintiff has made out a\nprima facie case in the complex area of employment discrimination,\"\nbut has instead endorsing a case-by-case approach. Id. at 995 n.3.\n\n   Ms. Anderson presented the testimony of Dr. Edwin Bradley,\nPh.D., CEO of Quantitative Research Associates. Specifically, Dr.\nBradley found that at the second screening stage, a statistically signif-\nicant under-representation (-6.64 standard deviations) of African-\nAmericans existed when the pool of applicants meeting the minimum\nqualifications for the posted position was compared to the applicants\nactually selected for an interview. J.A. 1645. Similarly, Dr. Bradley\nfound that at the third screening stage, a statistically significant under-\nrepresentation (-2.38 standard deviations) of African-Americans\nexisted when the pool of applicants selected for an interview was\ncompared to those selected for appointment. J.A. 1645.\n\n   Despite this, the district court concluded and the majority con-\ncludes that because Ms. Anderson’s statistical evidence failed to con-\ntrol for all variables that may have impacted the decisions made at the\nchallenged stages, it is insufficient to establish causation. Specifically,\nthe majority states:\n\n     \"This evidence does not show that the reason black appli-\n     cants failed to proceed at the interview selection stage and\n\f            ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                   47\n      position selection stage was their race. Factors such as pre-\n      sentation in the interview, answers to interview questions,\n      demeanor, and ability demonstrated in the interview of\n      course entered into the judgment of the members of the\n      panel as to the candidate who received a position that was\n      being filled.\"\n\nAnte at 25.\n\n   However, statistical evidence does not have to control for every\nsingle variable in order to be sufficient. As the Supreme Court stated\nin Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986), \"it is clear that a regres-\nsion analysis that included less than all ‘measurable variables’ may\nserve to prove a plaintiff’s case. A plaintiff in a Title VII suit need\nnot prove discrimination with scientific certainty; rather his burden is\nto prove discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.\"3 Id. at\n400. Therefore, requiring Ms. Anderson to account for every possible\nvariable that may have impacted the outcome goes beyond Supreme\nCourt formulations of the plaintiff’s burden in a Title VII disparate\nimpact case. In Watson, a case where the Court faced a challenge to\nsubjective practices, the Court required that the plaintiff \"offer evi-\ndence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in\nquestion has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions\nbecause of their membership in a protected group,\" and importantly\nnoted that its formulations have \"consistently stressed that statistical\ndisparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise such an\ninference of causation.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 995. Similarly, in Albe-\nmarle, the Court required the plaintiff to show \"that the tests in ques-\n  3\n   The Court’s decision in Bazemore has been read as allowing regres-\nsion analyses that account for the \"major\" factors. See e.g. Smith v. Vir-\nginia Commonwealth Univ., 84 F.3d 672, 676 (4th Cir. 1996) (\"While\nthe omission of variables from a regression analysis may render the anal-\nysis less probative than it otherwise might be, it can hardly be said,\nabsent some other infirmity, that an analysis which accounts for the\nmajor factors ‘must be considered unacceptable as evidence of discrimi-\nnation.’ Normally, failure to include variables will affect the analysis’\nprobativeness, not its admissibility. Importantly, it is clear that a regres-\nsion analysis that includes less than ‘all measurable variables’ may serve\nto prove a plaintiff’s case.\")\n\f48         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\ntion select applicants for hire or promotion in a racial pattern signifi-\ncantly different from that of the pool of applicants.\" Albemarle, 422\nU.S. at 425; see also Dothard, 433 U.S. at 329 (\"[T]o establish a\nprima facie case of discrimination, a plaintiff need only show that the\nfacially neutral standards in question select applicants for hire in a\nsignificantly discriminatory pattern.\").\n\n   I am of the opinion that Ms. Anderson satisfied her burden because\nMr. Bradley’s testimony is sufficient to show that the stages in ques-\ntion select applicants for hire or promotion in a racial pattern signifi-\ncantly different from that of the pool of applicants. In fact, the district\ncourt recognized that Dr. Bradley’s analysis demonstrated a \"statisti-\ncally significant variation between the number of African-Americans\nwho apply and the number who are successful at both the second and\nthird step of the CBPS process.\" J.A. 12228. As the CBPS process is\nset up, all candidates who made it to stage two of the process pos-\nsessed at least the minimum qualifications for the posted position.\nFurther, all candidates who received a stage three interview were not\nonly minimally qualified for the position in question, but were also\nfound by the relevant department manager to be the most qualified of\nall applicants. Yet despite this, Dr. Bradley found a statistically sig-\nnificant under-representation of African-Americans when comparing\nthe applicant pools to the successful candidates at the end of each\nstage.\n\n   Given these facts, I am at a loss to understand how the majority\nfinds that Ms. Anderson’s statistics fail to show that the stages in\nquestion select applicants for hire or promotion in a racial pattern sig-\nnificantly different from that of the pool of applicants. These statistics\npresent more than just a disparity in Westinghouse’s work force; they\npresent evidence that the challenged stages have caused the exclusion\nof African-Americans because of their membership in a protected\nclass. And this evidence, by virtue of the nature of the hiring process\nitself, controlled for the major factor in the hiring process that could\nbe controlled for, namely that of qualification. For example, despite\nthe fact that at stage three only the most qualified candidates are inter-\nviewed, Dr. Bradley found that African-Americans were under-\nrepresented in the class of those who actually received appointments\nafter interviewing. I recognize that this court is under no obligation\nto \"assume that plaintiffs’ statistical evidence is reliable.\" Watson,\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                49\n487 U.S. at 996. However, where a party shows that there is a statisti-\ncally significant under-representation of African-Americans success-\nfully completing a challenged subjective stage of a hiring process,\ndespite a number of qualified African-American candidates,4 I fail to\nsee how an inference of causation for the purposes of establishing a\nprima facie case of disparate impact has not been shown.\n\n   Additionally, by faulting Ms. Anderson for not controlling for cer-\ntain variables, the majority is in essence faulting her for not control-\nling for the exact factor that she is here challenging as causing a\ndisparate impact — the subjective aspects of stages two and three.\nThe majority states that \"[f]actors such as presentation in the inter-\nview, answers to interview questions, demeanor, and ability demon-\nstrated in the interview\" are factors that entered in the ultimate hiring\ndecisions, and that therefore in order to show causation any statistical\nevidence must control for these factors. Ante at 25. However, these\nare all subjective evaluations, and exactly what Ms. Anderson is chal-\nlenging. The majority points out that Ms. Anderson did not account\nfor the evaluation of core and functional competencies. But again, the\nevaluation of the core competencies, and any relevant functional com-\npetencies, is largely a subjective evaluation. While faulting Ms.\nAnderson for not controlling for these factors, the majority never\nexplains how such control would even be possible. As I questioned\nearlier, how does one quantify \"teamwork\" or \"leadership,\" such that\nit can be controlled for in a statistical setting. The very nature of the\nsubjective process challenged makes such control impossible.\n\n   As such, because Ms. Anderson identified a specific practice, dem-\nonstrated the existence of a disparity and established a causal nexus\nbetween the two, I would hold that Ms. Anderson did in fact state a\nprima facie case of disparate impact.\n\n                                  III.\n\n   Despite its belief that Ms. Anderson failed to satisfy her prima\nfacie burden, the majority assumes arguendo that she has and contin-\nues with its disparate impact analysis. According to the majority:\n  4\n  Especially at the third stage where all African-American interviewees\nwere considered to be among the most qualified applicants.\n\f50         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n     the question is whether the proffered circumstantial evi-\n     dence of discriminatory impact is sufficient to satisfy the\n     McDonell Douglas framework of proof . . . . Under this\n     framework the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie\n     case of discrimination. Then, the defendant must respond\n     with evidence that it acted with a legitimate, nondiscrimina-\n     tory reason. If the defendant makes this showing, then the\n     plaintiff must \"present evidence to prove that the defen-\n     dant’s articulated reason was pretext for unlawful discrimi-\n     nation.\"\n\nAnte at 26. After noting that under McDonnell Douglas the ultimate\nburden of proving intentional discrimination remains on the plaintiff,\nthe majority finds that Ms. Anderson failed to show that Westing-\nhouse’s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason was mere pretext for\nintentional discrimination.\n\n   In reaching this conclusion, the majority ignores the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Griggs, the impact of which was to squarely reject\nthe notion that in order to state a claim for employment discrimination\nthe claimant must make a showing of intent. As the Court stated in\nGriggs, \"good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not\nredeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as\n‘built in headwinds’ for minority groups and are unrelated to measur-\ning job capability.\" Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432.\n\n   Disparate impact and disparate treatment are two legally distinct\ncauses of action under Title VII. Disparate treatment requires the\nplaintiff to prove that the defendant had discriminatory intent or moti-\nvation. See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 986\n(1988). In contrast, disparate impact seeks to ferret out employment\npractices that are the functional equivalent of intentional discrimina-\ntion because they cause significant adverse effects on protected\ngroups, but have no deliberate discriminatory motive. Id. at 986-87.\nIt is important to note that while the Supreme Court has enunciated\nburden-shifting schemes for both disparate treatment and disparate\nimpact, the schemes possess critical differences that prevents one\nfrom applying either test in the other context. See Lex K. Larson,\nEmployment Discrimination § 8.01[2] (2d ed. 2004) (\"The principal\ncategory of suits to which the McDonnell Douglas formula does not\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                51\napply is that exemplified by the 1971 case of Griggs v. Duke Power\nCo.\"). As the Court noted in Watson, \"[t]he factual issues and the\ncharacter of the evidence are inevitably somewhat different when the\nplaintiff is exempted from the need to prove intentional discrimina-\ntion.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 987.\n\n   McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), sets\nforth the Supreme Court’s burden shifting formula for dealing with\nthe problem of proof in intentional discrimination cases.5 Under the\nMcDonnell Douglas burden shifting formula, after the plaintiff estab-\nlishes a prima facie case, \"the burden then must shift to the employer\nto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\nemployee’s rejection.\" Id. Should the employer articulate such a rea-\nson, the plaintiff must then be afforded an opportunity to show that\nthe articulated reason was merely pretext for a racially discriminatory\ndecision. Id. at 804-05.\n\n   By finding that Ms. Anderson had failed to show that Westing-\nhouse’s articulated reason was pretext, the majority in essence held\nthat Ms. Anderson had failed to prove intent. However, in the context\nof her disparate impact claim, Ms. Anderson was under no obligation\nto prove intent. As the statute itself makes clear, where the employer\ndemonstrates that the challenged practice is job related for the posi-\ntion in question and consistent with business necessity, the plaintiff\nmay still prevail by showing the existence of an equally effective\nalternative practice that eliminates the disparate impact and that the\nemployer refuses to adopt that alternative. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(a)(2). Nowhere does the statute require a showing of pretext,\nbecause pretext points to intent. Therefore, the majority’s application\nof any such burden to Ms. Anderson is error.\n\n  5\n   See Lex K. Larson, Employment Discrimination § 8.01[1] (2d ed.\n2004) (\"Employers are, on the whole, too sophisticated to profess their\nprejudices on paper or before witnesses. The Supreme Court in McDon-\nnell Douglas, recognizing the necessity in most instances of reliance on\ncircumstantial evidence, laid down rules of proof under which direct evi-\ndence of discriminatory intent is not necessary to the making of a prima\nfacie case.\").\n\f52         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n                                  IV.\n\n   Disparate impact is more than a mere method of smoking out inten-\ntional discrimination. Disparate impact attacks a set of deleterious\nbehaviors that the intent standard fails to capture. By definition, the\nstandard attacks only those practices that have a disparate impact on\nthe employment opportunities of classes protected by Title VII when\nthose practices are not supported by a legitimate business justification\nor where the same end-goals can be achieved in a less deleterious\nmanner. Given the struggles of this nation, a practice that has a dispa-\nrate adverse impact on a protected class, and yet either has no legiti-\nmate business justification, or can be achieved in a less harmful\nmanner, is not a practice that we should allow to stand. Ultimately,\nthis is a recognition by society that these practices, and their effects,\nare harmful in their own right. To continue moving a healing society\nforward, any such practices must be attacked under Title VII with a\nlevel of vigor equal to that spent combating intentional discrimina-\ntion.\n\n   With its holdings today, the majority has made the mountain a\nplaintiff must climb to state a disparate impact claim harder to sur-\nmount. Not only has the majority in essence required the plaintiff here\nto prove causation to a scientific certainty, they have also forced the\nplaintiff to show intent despite the clear statutory and jurisprudential\ndictates to the contrary. As I cannot concur with either of these\nresults, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

We generally affirm the district court, but remand for\nconsideration of whether class should be certified with a new lead\nplaintiff.\n\f6          ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n                                  I.\n\n   Virginia Anderson is a black female employed at the Department\nof Energy’s Savannah River Site. The Savannah River Site is man-\naged for the Department of Energy by Westinghouse Savannah River\nCompany, LLC (Westinghouse). Bechtel Savannah River, Inc.,\n(Bechtel), Babcox & Wilcox Savannah River Company (B & W), and\nBritish Nuclear Fuels Ltd. Savannah River Corporation (BNFL) also\nparticipate in the management of the Savannah River Site pursuant to\na contract with the Department of Energy. Each company is a defen-\ndant in this action.\n\n   In the past, the Savannah River Site produced materials needed for\nthe fabrication of nuclear weapons, but its current mission is focused\non environmental cleanup and processing radioactive materials. The\nSavannah River Site covers 310 square miles in western South Caro-\nlina, and, in 1999, over 13,000 employees worked at the sites for the\nfour defendants. Of those employees, 2765 were black.\n\n   Virginia Anderson began working at the Savannah River Site in\n1978 as a typist in a typing pool. Miss Anderson became a stenogra-\npher a year later. She worked as a stenographer in several different\ndepartments at the Savannah River Site until 1989. In 1989, Miss\nAnderson became an administrative secretary in the materials technol-\nogy group. The transition from stenographer to administrative secre-\ntary was a promotion for Miss Anderson, and, as an administrative\nsecretary, she had more responsibilities. As an administrative secre-\ntary, Miss Anderson received a salary at the SGL 16 level. Miss\nAnderson remained with the materials technology group until July of\n1998. In August of 1998, she received a promotion to administrative\nassistant in the university relations group within the chemicals hydro-\ngen technology group. With her promotion, Miss Anderson’s salary\nlevel increased to SGL 28 SOP. SOP stands for selective overtime\npositions, and, as a SGL 28 SOP employee, Miss Anderson received\nadditional compensation above her salary if she worked a certain\nnumber of hours above her normal working hours. Miss Anderson\nremained with the university relations group through the time she\nfiled her lawsuit against the defendants.\n\n  When she began working at the Savannah River Site, Miss Ander-\nson’s higher educational background was limited to an executive sec-\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                 7\nretary diploma from Augusta Tech, which she received in 1977.\nDuring her tenure at the Savannah River Site, Miss Anderson pursued\nfurther higher education degrees. In 1996, Miss Anderson took her\nbachelor of science degree in human resources management from\nSouthern Wesleyan University. In June of 1998, Miss Anderson\nreceived her masters in business administration from Nova Southeast-\nern University. Miss Anderson’s promotion from administrative sec-\nretary, with a pay level of SGL 16, to administrative assistant, with\na pay level of SGL 28 SOP, came just months after she received her\nM.B.A.\n\n    In the 1990’s, the Savannah River Site instituted two programs, one\nfor promotions and one for merit pay increases, that are at issue in this\nlitigation. The first is the Competency Based Posting System, or\nCBPS. The Competency Based System is an application and promo-\ntion system which Savannah River Site employees may use to apply\nfor new positions and promotions. Under the system, exempt or non-\nexempt employees may apply for any posted position that is available,\nwith a few exceptions. According to the description contained in\nWestinghouse Savannah River Company 5B Manual, the hiring and\npromotion process under the Competency Based System is as follows:\n\n      1. Open position is submitted to HR for posting.\n\n          The hiring manager ensures the position description is\n          complete and correct; adding, and weighing the values\n          of, necessary competencies. HR Compensation estab-\n          lishes the salary grade of the position at or below the\n          salary grade of the previous incumbent (if any). No\n          preferred candidates exist in this system.\n\n      2. HR posts the position in ShRINE (sic) for ten working\n         days.\n\n      3. The hiring manager establishes an interview panel.\n\n          With the HR lead, the hiring manager selects appropri-\n          ate individuals, based on their job knowledge and\n          familiarity with the position, to sit on an interview\n\f8         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n         panel. The panel consists of three members, one of\n         whom must always be the hiring manager.\n\n     4. Self-nominating individuals submit their qualifications\n        to HR-Staffing.\n\n         Submitted qualifications can include a Personal His-\n         tory form (OSR 27-13) and/or resume.\n\n     5. Individuals nominated by others submit their qualifica-\n        tions to HR-Staffing.\n\n         With their consent, candidates can be nominated by\n         others. Nominations are not restricted to managers.\n         The hiring manager cannot nominate. Candidates sub-\n         mit a Personal History form (OSR 27-13) or resume\n         and copies of their last three performance appraisals to\n         HR-Staffing.\n\n     6. HR confirms that applicants meet posted position\n        requirements.\n\n         Eligible candidates are identified based on minimum\n         requirements listed in the position profile.\n\n     7. HR-Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) reviews\n        the list of applicants for consistency with corporate\n        and affirmative action planning.\n\n     8. HR-Staffing submits eligible applicants to the hiring\n        manager.\n\n     9. Within five working days of receiving the material\n        from HR-Staffing, the hiring manager selects candi-\n        dates for interviews.\n\n    10. All applicants are informed of the status of their appli-\n        cation.\n\f     ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.              9\n11. Individuals selected for an interview receive a candi-\n    date information package regarding the interview pro-\n    cess.\n\n12. The hiring manager schedules and conducts, with the\n    panel, interviews within 10 working days after candi-\n    dates are notified of their status.\n\n13. The hiring manager selects the candidate who best\n    meets position requirements.\n\n     The final decision is made by the hiring manager with\n     input from the other two interview panel members and\n     after review by the HR lead. The next level of manage-\n     ment must also review and approve the selected candi-\n     date.\n\n14. HR-EEO review candidate selection for consistency\n    with corporate and affirmative action planning.\n\n15. If a promotion is necessary, HR-Compensation, HR-\n    EEO, and the division HR lead review the decision to\n    ensure that all relevant criteria are met.\n\n16. HR-Staffing prepares a formal offer and the hiring\n    manager extends the offer to the candidate.\n\n17. The candidate accepts or rejects the offer within two\n    calendar days.\n\n18. The hiring manager informs all interviewed candidates\n    and the sending manager of the selected candidate of\n    the selection process outcome.\n\n19. The selected candidate is released to the new position\n    within four weeks of acceptance.\n\n     If the releasing manager and the hiring manager both\n     agree, the release time-frame can be shortened. The\n     release time-frame cannot exceed four weeks.\n\f10         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n   Under the Competency Based System, hiring managers can evalu-\nate applicants in six core competencies: teamwork, leadership, com-\nmunications, business results, self-management, and employee\ndevelopment. The hiring managers can also evaluate applicants using\nselected functional competencies that are specific to the position for\nwhich the manager is hiring. For example, a particular functional\ncompetency could be \"[p]roficient in heating, ventilation and air-\nconditioning design,\" and the CBPS manual explains that\n\"[f]unctional competencies can be derived from the responsibility sec-\ntion on the job description.\" Each competency is assigned a weight,\nusing a number from one to five, in which five is \"[m]ost important\nrelative to other competencies\" and one is \"[l]east important relative\nto other competencies.\" The interview panel then selects candidates\nfor interviews and then interviews each selected candidate.\n\n   Each applicant who is interviewed is evaluated by the interview\npanel using the core and functional competencies. The interview\npanel determines a weighted score for each applicant on each core\nand functional competency. The panel determines the weighted score\nby multiplying the weight given to each competency (one to five) by\nthe applicant’s rating for each competency. The panel rates the appli-\ncant on a scale of one to five, with a five meaning \"[d]emonstrates\nexceptional competence\" and a one meaning \"[d]id not demonstrate\nexpected level of competence.\" The panel determines the applicant’s\ntotal weighted score by adding together the weighted scores for each\ncompetency. The hiring manager then selects the candidate for the\nposition, after noting the total weighted scores for each candidate, and\nrecords the basis for selecting the chosen candidate.\n\n   The second program instituted at the Savannah River Site was the\nRanked Performance Pay Process, or RP3. The Site began using the\nprogram in 1997 to rank exempt and selected overtime position\nemployees for merit increases in salary. Two major factors are uti-\nlized under the RP3 system to determine which employees should\nreceive merit raises. Job performance constitutes 75% of the ranking\ngiven to an employee, and the remaining 25% is derived from rank-\nings on Site Imperatives. Site Imperatives \"are the basis of how we\n[Site employees] each are expected to accomplish the business objec-\ntives of our work group, division, and company as a whole.\" The five\nSite Imperatives are safety, disciplined operations, cost effectiveness,\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.              11\ncontinuous improvement, and teamwork. Each Site Imperative is\nweighted five percent in the total ranking, with the total for all five\nconstituting 25% of an employee’s final ranking.\n\n   Under the RP3 system, each manager must use the RP3 electronic\nevaluation worksheet to rate each employee in the manager’s organi-\nzation. The evaluation process begins with the smallest unit of organi-\nzation, the department or section. Once the initial rankings are\ncomputed for the department or section, all employees within a single\nwork group are ranked by the next level of management. At the next\nstep, the rankings for a division, each division’s manager may inte-\ngrate the work group rankings to achieve a ranking of employees\nwithin the division. The division manager may rank all employees in\nvarious combinations. Among the combinations suggested by the RP3\nsystem manual are (1) total ranking of all employees; (2) rank within\nseparate work groups; (3) managers, leads, and professionals; (4) sal-\nary grade clusters, i.e., all SGL 16 employees or all SGL 32 to 34\nemployees; or (5) managers, leads, and professionals by salary grade\nclusters.\n\n   The employee rankings for each division are then broken into per-\nformance categories consisting of the high 15%, the middle 80%, and\nthe low five percent. Final rankings are approved by the division man-\nager, and merit salary increases are awarded based on each division’s\nbudget and salary guidechart. The Human Resources Compensation\ndepartment must approve any merit increases that are outside of the\nsalary guidechart. All employees, regardless of their ranking percent-\nage, are eligible for merit increases, but the top 15% may receive the\nhighest merit increases. Another factor that contributes to the size of\na merit increase is whether the employee is above or below the mid-\npoint of their salary grade. For example, if an employee is an A per-\nformer whose salary level is below the midpoint of his salary grade,\nhe is eligible to receive a merit increase, the amount of which may\nbe different if he is an A performer whose salary level is above the\nmidpoint of his salary grade.\n\n   In ranking their employees for job performance, which accounts for\n75% of an employee’s ranking, the RP3 manual instructs managers\nto consider the following factors:\n\f12         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n      Job expectations\n      Quality and quantity of work\n      Position scope (performance against position description)\n      Support to achieving commitments\n      Feedback from others (managers, peers, or customers)\n      Awards, recognition\n      Performance standards (leadership, judgment)\n\nFor job performance, an employee receives a rating of either \"Low,\"\nmeaning \"[c]onsistently performs at a level below expectations,\" or\n\"Mid,\" meaning \"[c]onsistently performs at the level of expectations,\"\nor \"High, \" meaning \"consistently performs at a level that exceeds\nexpectations.\" Managers also use the low, mid, or high rankings to\nevaluate their employees in the five Site Imperatives. The RP3 man-\nual lists the performance indicators that managers should use when\ndetermining whether an employee should receive a low, mid, or high\nrank for each imperative.\n\n   In her lawsuit, Miss Anderson complains about three separate\ninstances in which she sought and subsequently failed to receive a\npromotion. In 1997, Miss Anderson applied for the position of\nAdministrative Assistant in the Environmental Restoration Division.\nThe hiring manager, Miss Gail Toddings, posted the opening using\nthe CBPS, and approximately 150 employees applied for the position.\nAfter the Site’s Human Resources department evaluated the applica-\ntions, 30 to 40 resumes were sent to Miss Toddings. The outgoing\nadministrative assistant, Miss Laboris Curry, assisted Miss Toddings\nin evaluating the resumes and choosing 15 people to interview. Miss\nToddings made the final decision on who would be interviewed. Miss\nAnderson was selected for an interview, and she interviewed for the\nposition on December 15, 1997, before an interview panel chaired by\nMiss Toddings.

The interview panel gave its lowest rating score of 129.5 to a\nwhite female employee.\n\n   In 1998, Miss Anderson applied for the position of Administrative\nAssistant in the Business Development and Community Outreach\nDivision. Miss Anderson was not selected for an interview on the\nbasis of her low scores for the functional competencies of the posi-\ntion. Only two applicants received higher scores in core competencies\nthan Miss Anderson, but eight applicants had higher ratings in the\nfunctional competencies. Miss Anderson received a rating of 59 out\nof a possible 72 for core competencies and a rating of 9 out of a possi-\nble 57 for functional competencies, for a total rating of 68. In con-\ntrast, the individual chosen for the promotion, Mrs. Brenda Pearson\n(formerly Miss Brenda Boggs), a white woman, received a rating of\n60 out of a possible 72 for core competencies and a rating of 57 out\nof a possible 57 for functional competencies, for a total rating of 117.\nMrs. Pearson received the promotion, and Miss Anderson did not.\n\n   Miss Anderson also alleges that she was denied a promotion from\nSGL 28 SOP to SGL 30 while in her position as administrative assis-\ntant in the university relations group. She complains that she was told\nshe had to work in her current position for two to four years before\nshe could receive a promotion in place. She contends that white\nemployees received promotions in place without having to work in\ntheir positions for two to four years.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   This lawsuit began on October 31, 1997, when ten black Site\nemployees filed a class action lawsuit against the defendants. The ten\nplaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and Title VII alleg-\ning that the defendants denied black employees promotions on an\nequal basis with white employees, maintained salary discrepancies\nbetween black and white employees, denied black employees access\nto training opportunities on an equal basis with white employees,\ndemoted black employees on the basis of their race, and discriminated\nagainst black employees by keeping them in less desirable positions.\nThe ten plaintiffs also brought individual claims for disparate treat-\n\f14         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nment on the basis of race. Miss Anderson later joined the lawsuit as\na plaintiff, and a total of 99 individuals became plaintiffs.\n\n   The plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of all current and\nformer black employees of the defendants who worked at the Site\nwho had been or will be subject to discrimination by the defendants.\nAfter oral argument was held on the class certification motion, the\ndistrict court denied the motion \"as to the proposed class or any sub-\nclass suggested by Plaintiffs.\" The district court determined that the\nplaintiffs’ \"across the board\" challenges to the defendants’ employee\npractices did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure and were not supported by governing\nSupreme Court and Fourth Circuit case law.\n\n   After denying the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, the dis-\ntrict court ordered the plaintiffs to pursue their claims individually.\nFollowing the district court’s instruction, Miss Anderson filed an\namended complaint on July 26, 2000. In her complaint, she brings\nclaims for disparate impact discrimination, relating to the defendants’\nuse of the CBPS and RP3 systems and to the defendants’ pay prac-\ntices, and claims for disparate treatment, relating to the three promo-\ntions she did not receive.\n\n   The district court held an evidentiary hearing after ruling on the\nmotions for class certification. At issue in the hearing was the pro-\nposed testimony of Dr. Edwin L. Bradley, the plaintiff’s prospective\nexpert witness. After listening to testimony and argument, the district\ncourt excluded from evidence Dr. Bradley’s proposed expert opinion\ntestimony on the discriminatory impact of the RP3 system. The dis-\ntrict court excluded this testimony on the grounds that it was based\non statistical research and analysis that did not have proper controls.\nDr. Bradley had conducted several studies regarding the RP3 system.\nIn several instances, Dr. Bradley’s statistical analysis compared black\nand white employees under the RP3 ranking system without taking\ninto account any differences in their job titles or position. The district\ncourt also excluded from evidence a draft copy of an assessment of\nWestinghouse’s equal employment opportunity, human resources, and\nemployee concerns programs conducted by the Department of\nEnergy.\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                15\n   The district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment as to Miss Anderson’s individual disparate impact and dis-\nparate treatment claims. The district court denied the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment as to Miss Anderson’s disparate treat-\nment pay claim, but Miss Anderson had the remaining claim dis-\nmissed with prejudice so that she could pursue this appeal.\n\n                                  III.\n\n   We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants de novo, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences\ndrawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Anderson.

In its opinion denying the plaintiffs’ motion\nfor class certification, the district court noted that the plaintiffs’ pro-\nposed subclasses, if they had been raised in a timely fashion instead\nof as part of the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the district\ncourt’s ruling on class certification, would be denied because of the\nfailure of the proposed classes to satisfy the requirements of common-\nality and typicality.\n\n   After denying the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, the dis-\ntrict court held a hearing to consider evidentiary issues.

The report upon which this testimony\nwould be based showed that for the years 1998 and 1999 the number\nof standard deviations between the RP3 rankings given to black\nexempt employees and white exempt employees was -2.61 and -2.14,\nrespectively. In making the comparisons, Dr. Bradley controlled the\nanalysis using job groups. In other words, Dr. Bradley’s analysis\nshowed that, using the job groups as the category in which employees\nare grouped, that whites had higher RP3 rankings than blacks.2 The\ndistrict court found this analysis wanting.\n  2\n    Dr. Bradley’s testimony also would have relied on nine other studies\nthat also failed to properly compare employees in similar job positions\nand titles. Several of Dr. Bradley’s studies did not have any controls to\nensure that the percentage of high RP3 rankings and merit increases\nawarded to African-Americans was not influenced by other factors or by\ncomparing dissimilar employees. Other studies reviewing merit increases\ncontrolled for ranking received or for race and ranking but not for the\nactual factors that comprise the ranking or for the different job responsi-\nbilities that workers in different divisions may have. Five of Dr. Brad-\n\f18         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n   The district court found that \"the studies are deficient because they\nuse the EEO job groupings.\" During the hearing, Dr. Bradley testified\nthat job groups could contain numerous and diverse occupations. For\nexample, Dr. Bradley admitted under questioning that a single job\ngroup could contain 147 separate individual job titles and up to seven\nseparate pay grades. Dr. Bradley also testified that a single job group\ncould contain the following job titles: optician, counsel, physician,\nand psychologist. Furthermore, under the guidelines for managers\nusing the RP3 system to rate employees, the managers are instructed\nthat \"[t]he single most important component of any employee’s over-\nall performance involves the completion of their individual job-\nrelated responsibilities. This factor is weighted 75% of the total evalu-\nation.\" Those instructions also note that the \"[r]equirements of each\njob are often unique - there is not a single standard by which all\nemployees can be measured.\" According to Savannah River Site\nemployment policies, the RP3 ranking system is to be utilized to\ndetermine merit raises for employees within a single division. In 1998\nand 1999, the Savannah River Site had at least 18 separate divisions,\nand the RP3 system was to be used to rank employees for merit raises\nwithin, and not across, each division.\n\n   Dr. Bradley’s studies utilized various controls, i.e. job group, job\nperformance categories, division, EEO job category, adjusted years of\nservice, FLSA group. The studies, however, failed to compare simi-\n\nley’s studies involving RP3 rankings compared workers only by division,\nbut, within a division, there are many distinct types of positions with dif-\nferent responsibilities.\n   In Herold v.

(emphasis in\noriginal). The plaintiffs in Smith were five male professors at Virginia\nCommonwealth University who brought a lawsuit under Title VII to\nchallenge pay raises given to female faculty members after the univer-\nsity conducted a salary equity study. 84 F.3d at 674. In Smith, we\nreversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment because the\ndistrict court relied on regression analyses that failed to include all\nmajor factors that influence the salaries of professors. 84 F.3d at 676.\nWe also explained that\n\n    [a]lso at issue is the fact that the study included male faculty\n    members who had returned from higher paying positions in\n    the VCU administration but kept the higher salary. The\n    study did not account for this salary differential. This,\n    according to the appellants, leads to an illogical comparison\n    involving an inflated pool of faculty members; eighty-five\n    percent of the faculty whose salaries were increased because\n    of prior service as administrators were male. An inflated\n    pool can undermine the validity of a statistical study to\n    determine imbalances.\n\n84 F.3d at 677 (footnote deleted). The study relied upon by the uni-\nversity was deficient because it failed to properly compare the salaries\nof male and female professors using the criteria that the university uti-\nlized to award raises. See Smith, 84 F.3d at 676-77 (noting that VCU\nused performance, productivity, and merit to award prior raises and\nthat these factors were not considered in the salary equity study).\n\n   The study used by VCU attempted to compare the salaries paid to\nmale and female professors. As professors, whether male or female,\nthe faculty at VCU was employed to teach and conduct research. The\nsalary equity study, though deficient, compared the salaries paid to\nmembers of the same profession. Dr. Bradley’s studies, however,\nevaluate the RP3 ranking process by using not a single job title for\ncomparison, such as professor, but by using job groups. As he admit-\nted during the evidentiary hearing, his study utilized results from a job\n\f20         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\ngroup, which could include diverse jobs such as counsel, optician,\nphysician, and psychologist. The ratings for performance as a counsel\nmay be different from those for a physician, even if the counsel and\nphysician being compared are of the same race.\n\n   We are of opinion and hold that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in excluding Dr. Bradley’s testimony based on his statisti-\ncal analysis. The analysis was based on comparisons that were not rel-\nevant to Miss Anderson’s claims. \"The usefulness of statistics\ndepends on the surrounding facts and circumstances.\" Carter v.

And in order to evaluate\n     whether or not there is disparate impact in ratings, similarly\n     situated persons who are being rated must be compared.\n     And there is simply too much disparity in the groups that\n     have been used to control, and an absence of the use of a\n     control factor that would control for the actual job title or\n     the job duties.\n\n     And it does appear to me — and I believe the witness has\n     conceded that that could have been done and was not con-\n     trolled for, and for that reason the court grants the motion.\n\f           ANDERSON v.

The assess-\nment team admitted in its report that it \"did not attempt to verify the\nperception of the employees\" who were interviewed. In analyzing the\nracial composition of interview panels, the assessment team based its\nstatistics on a review of 30 interview panels. During the 21-month\nperiod from which those 30 panels were chosen, the Savannah River\nSite utilized about 900 panels to select candidates for new positions.\nOf those 900 panels, the assessment team thus reviewed the racial\ncomposition of only 3.3% of the panels.\n\n   The admissibility of a report under Rule 803(8) is \"permissive and\nnot mandatory.\" United States v.

Miss\nAnderson did not address her RP3 disparate impact claim in her brief\nexcept to note that she wishes to pursue the claim if the district\ncourt’s evidentiary ruling on Dr. Bradley’s testimony is reversed. We\nhave affirmed the district court’s evidentiary ruling, and our affir-\nmance admittedly forecloses Miss Anderson’s chance for success on\nher RP3 disparate impact claim.3\n\n                                   B.\n\n   We next address Miss Anderson’s disparate impact claim involving\nthe CBPS. On appeal, she argues that the district court erred by con-\ncluding that she had not established causation and by requiring her to\nprove intentional discrimination instead of a disparate impact claim.\nWe review de novo her challenge to the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment. Williams, 370 F.3d at 428.\n\n   Miss Anderson contends that two aspects of the CBPS have a dis-\nparate impact on black employees. First, she challenges the stage in\nthe CBPS where applicants are selected for an interview, and, second,\nshe challenges the stage where the interview panel chooses the candi-\ndate for the position after an interview. These steps are listed as #9,\n#12, and #13 in the description of the CBPS found on pages 8-9 of\nthis opinion. Miss Anderson objects to the alleged subjectivity inher-\nent in these steps in the CBPS.\n\n   By her identification of these steps in the CBPS, we assume,\narguendo, that Miss Anderson has complied with the Court’s instruc-\ntion that a plaintiff in a disparate impact case must identify the spe-\ncific employment practice that is being challenged. See Watson v.\nFort Worth Bank & Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112145\"><a href=\"/opinion/112145/watson-v-fort-worth-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 994 (1988) (plurality opin-\nion). Next, Miss Anderson must prove causation. 487 U.S. at 994. She\nmust show that the above-mentioned practices caused a disparate\nimpact on black employees at the Site.\n  3\n   Miss Anderson withdrew her RP3 disparate impact claim after the\ndistrict court excluded Dr. Bradley’s testimony based on his statistical\nevidence. As a result, although she pursued this claim on appeal, her suc-\ncess is dependent on our decision on the evidentiary issue.\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                 25\n   To establish causation, Miss Anderson relies on statistical evidence\nprovided by Dr. Bradley about the CBPS. She argues that Dr. Brad-\nley’s statistical evidence ruled out the possibility that chance caused\na disparate impact on black employees. Dr. Bradley had analyzed the\npercentage of black employees who were successful under the CBPS\nat three stages: (1) selection as qualified for a position from all candi-\ndates who apply; (2) selected for an interview from all qualified can-\ndidates; and (3) selected for the position from all interviewed\ncandidates. Dr. Bradley compared the percentage of black employees\nwho actually succeeded at each level with the percentage which he\nexpected to succeed, based on the percentage of black employees at\nthe Site. He found that the percentage of black applicants who actu-\nally succeeded at each step was much lower than he expected. From\nthat evidence, which does not account for any other variables, Miss\nAnderson argues that causation is proven.\n\n   We do not agree. This evidence does not show that the reason\nblack applicants failed to proceed at the interview selection stage and\nposition selection stage was their race. Factors such as presentation\nin the interview, answers to interview questions, demeanor, and abil-\nity demonstrated in the interview of course entered into the judgment\nof the members of the panel as to the candidate who received a posi-\ntion that was being filled. And, at the interview selection stage, for\nexample, education and experience are two factors that Dr. Bradley’s\nanalysis fails to quantify.\n\n   Furthermore, at each of the two stages which Miss Anderson chal-\nlenges in the CBPS, the discretion of the person or panel making the\ndecision is not unfettered. At each step, the decision maker must look\nto the core competencies listed in the CBPS manual and the specific\nfunctional competencies, which are chosen specifically for each posi-\ntion. At the interview stage, a panel of three interviewers must evalu-\nate the candidate and must address each core and functional\ncompetency. The cases on which Miss Anderson relies to support her\nclaim that causation has been proven involves supervisors who pos-\nsessed unfettered discretion to make employment decisions.

Accordingly, the cases on which\nMiss Anderson relies are hardly supportive of her position, for the\nonly relevant complaint she makes to the process is that the decision\nmakers were white.\n\n   The district court did not bar from evidence Dr. Bradley’s conclu-\nsion that there might be evidence of disparate impact in two hiring\nstages — the interview stage and the selection stage — and correctly\nrejected the claim that his conclusion that the preparation of the list\nof eligibles by the Human Resources department might be subject to\na Title VII racial objection.\n\n   We assume for argument, without deciding, that Miss Anderson\nhas shown a prima facie case because the district court did not bar Dr.\nBradley’s conclusions as to disparate impact with respect to the inter-\nview stage and the selection stage.

Under this\nframework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination. Then the defendant must respond with evidence that it\nacted with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Murrell, 262 F.3d\nat 257. If the defendant makes this showing, then the plaintiff must\n\"present evidence to prove that the defendant’s articulated reason was\npretext for unlawful discrimination.\" Murrell, 262 F.3d at 257. \"Al-\nthough the evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under the McDon-\n\f           ANDERSON v.

Further, Miss Anderson failed to address her qualifications in terms\nof the disclosed weighted competency factors. Miss Anderson instead\nfocuses on her claimed higher satisfaction of the minimum qualifica-\ntions, such as her education level, an MBA as opposed to others with\nhigh school education, her performance of more years of administra-\ntive secretarial duties, and her numerous awards and recognition,\nwhich exceeded recognition received by other interviewees. The dis-\ntrict court found in its opinion that \"[w]hile these may be the criteria\nby which Anderson believes she should have been judged, Anderson\nhas not offered any evidence that WSRC or the particular individuals\nwho made up the CBPS panel have, at any time, applied such a set\nof standards.\" Slip op. at 6. For these reasons, pretext is simply not\nshown as there is no evidence to support it regarding the 1997 claim.\n\n   Miss Anderson similarly fails to point to any evidence that would\nsupport the conclusion that she deserved a higher rating on any of the\nareas evaluated for the 1998 promotion to administrative assistant.\nShe also fails to provide any evidence that the panel overlooked evi-\ndence of her abilities in the areas contained in her application. Rather,\nas with the 1997 application, she focuses on her supposed greater\nqualifications in terms of total years of employment or education.\nAgain, Miss Anderson has not proffered evidence to suggest that the\nlegitimate reason offered by WSRC for its hiring decision is pretex-\ntual.\n\n  So pretext has not been shown for either the 1997 or 1998 claim\nand the decision of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                                 VIII.\n\n   We turn next to Miss Anderson’s individual disparate treatment\nclaims.

Miss Anderson\nclaims that the defendants failed to promote her on the basis of her\nrace. Linda Clarke, a white employee, received the promotion instead\nof Miss Anderson.

As a result of the defendants’ decision\nto base the promotion decision on the core and functional competen-\ncies listed in the job description and not on the educational levels of\napplicants, Miss Anderson cannot rely on her educational background\nto establish that the defendants’ reasons for promoting Mrs. Clarke\nwas a pretext for discrimination. See Beall, 130 F.3d at 620; Jiminez,\n57 F.3d at 383. Miss Anderson may not choose the areas in which she\nwants to compete with Mrs. Clarke for the promotion; those areas are\nfor the employer’s choosing.\n\n   Miss Anderson contends that she has more experience at the\nSavannah River Site than Mrs. Clarke. At the time of her application\nfor promotion to administrative assistant in the Environmental Resto-\nration Division, Project Administration Department, Mrs. Clarke had\n15 years of secretarial experience prior to beginning work at the\nSavannah River Site. After being hired at the Site, she had seven\nyears of experience at the time she applied for the position. In con-\ntrast, Miss Anderson had only eight years of experience as a secretary\nat the Site. While Miss Anderson, with seven years of secretarial\nexperience and twelve as a typist or stenographer, has a longer total\ntenure at the Site than Mrs. Clarke, she cannot choose the criteria by\nwhich an employer makes a promotion decision. See Beall, 130 F.3d\nat 619-20. Regarding experience, the CBPS posting of the position\nexplained that experience was a minimum requirement, and not a\ndeciding factor in the application process.\n\n   Furthermore, the deciding factor in the promotion decision was the\nrating for core and functional competencies that each applicant who\nwas interviewed received. Mrs. Clarke received the highest score,\n190, and Miss Anderson received the second-lowest score, 136. A\ncomparison of the two rating forms, compiled by the same interview\npanel, indicates that the panel found Mrs. Clarke to be the superior\ncandidate. Miss Anderson’s attempts to show that the CBPS system,\nwhich creates the consensus rating system upon which the promotion\ndecision was based, discriminates against black employees also are\nunsuccessful. This contention is based on Dr. Bradley’s study com-\nparing the percentage of black employees who are successful at three\nseparate steps in the CBPS to the expected percentage of successful\n\f32         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nblack candidates based on the total percentage of black employees at\nthe Site. As we discussed previously, this study fails to consider the\nvarious factors that are involved in a promotion decision. It does not\nprove that the CBPS discriminates against black employees on the\nbasis of race, and Miss Anderson cannot use it to avoid summary\njudgment on her 1997 failure to promote claim. We are of opinion\nthat the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the\ndefendants on this claim.\n\n   Miss Anderson’s next claim involves her application in 1998 for a\npromotion to administrative assistant in the Business Development\nand Community Outreach Division. Miss Anderson was not selected\nfor an interview, and a white woman, Mrs. Brenda Pearson, was\nselected to receive the promotion. Miss Anderson contends that she\ndid not receive the promotion due to her race.\n\n   The issue again turns on pretext as we assume, arguendo, that Miss\nAnderson has established a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\nOn appeal, Miss Anderson contends that she established pretext\nbecause she has a stronger educational background than Mrs. Pearson,\nthat the defendants pre-selected Mrs. Pearson for the position, and\nthat the ratings given to Miss Anderson in the interview selection\nstage evidence discrimination because they do not correspond to Miss\nAnderson’s performance reviews. Miss Anderson also reiterates the\ncontention, which we have rejected, that the CBPS discriminates\nagainst black employees seeking promotions at the Site.\n\n   While Miss Anderson has a stronger educational background than\nMrs. Pearson, education is listed as a minimum requirement for the\nposition and is not a deciding factor in determining who receives the\npromotion. Mrs. Pearson received the promotion because she had a\nhigher consensus rating on the core and functional competencies for\nthe position than Miss Judy Burch, the other employee interviewed\nfor the promotion. The selection of applicants for interviews also was\nbased on an evaluation of core and functional competencies, not on\neducational backgrounds. As we noted before, Miss Anderson may\nnot choose the criteria on which she wishes to compete with Mrs.\nPearson for the promotion. Moreover, she cannot establish pretext by\nrelying on criteria of her choosing when the employer based its deci-\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               33\nsion on other grounds. See Beall, 130 F.3d at 620; Jiminez, 57 F.3d\nat 383.\n\n   Miss Anderson next contends that she established pretext by show-\ning that Miss Virginia Wolfe, the hiring manager for the 1998 promo-\ntion in the Business Development and Community Outreach Division,\npreselected Mrs. Pearson for the promotion. At the time the promo-\ntion decision was made, Mrs. Pearson was a secretary who reported\nto Miss Wolfe, along with eight other individuals. The functions of\nthe position for which Miss Anderson applied were, prior to the selec-\ntion of Mrs. Pearson, being performed by Mrs. Pearson in her position\nas a secretary reporting to Miss Wolfe.\n\n   The argument that a supervisor may have preselected an employee\nfor a promotion \"is not sufficient evidence for jurors reasonably to\nconclude\" that the defendants’ explanation for hiring Mrs. Pearson\nwas prextext.

Miss Anderson’s argument\nasks us to review the process by which the defendants select employ-\nees for promotion. Miss Anderson has not introduced any evidence\nthat her performance reviews were submitted to the hiring manager\nwho selected applicants for an interview. Without proof that the hir-\ning manager had access to Miss Anderson’s performance reviews,\nthere is no basis to conclude that the hiring manager was even aware\nof the positive comments Miss Anderson had received on her perfor-\nmance evaluations. Furthermore, the performance evaluation is a\nreview of an employee’s performance in her current position, while\n\f34         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nthe process of selecting a person for a promotion involves a consider-\nation of how that employee will perform in a different position. In\nother words, the performance evaluation and the interview selection\nstage, which involves an analysis of how the applicant meets the core\nand functional competencies of the position that is open, are not inter-\nchangeable. We do not sit as a \"super-personnel department weighing\nthe prudence of employment decisions\" made by the defendants.\nDeJarnette v.

We\ncannot require that different supervisors within the same organization\nmust reach the same conclusion on an employee’s qualifications and\nabilities.\n\n  We are of opinion that the district court did not err in granting sum-\nmary judgment to the defendants on Miss Anderson’s 1998 failure to\npromote claim.\n\n  Miss Anderson’s final disparate treatment failure to promote claim\ncenters on her failure to receive a promotion in place from SGL 28\nSOP to SGL 30 SOP. At the time she sought this promotion, she was\nan administrative assistant in the university relations group within the\nchemicals hydrogen technology group. Again, the issue turns on the\nquestion of pretext.\n\n   Miss Anderson must establish that there is a genuine issue of mate-\nrial fact as to the defendants’ stated reason for why she did not\nreceive a promotion in place to SGL 30 SOP. The defendants have\nintroduced affidavits from three compensation analysts who recom-\nmended that Miss Anderson’s position remain a SGL 28 SOP position\ninstead of a SGL 30 SOP position as of 1999. Miss Anderson does\nnot direct us to any evidence which suggests that these analysts\nreached their conclusions by improperly considering race instead of\nthe actual responsibilities of Miss Anderson’s position. Miss Ander-\nson attempts to rely on her own affidavit to create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact, but nothing in her affidavit controverts the analysts’\nanalysis of her position or suggests that the analysts were motivated\nby racism to refuse to qualify her position as a SGL 30 SOP position.\n\n  Miss Anderson attempts to establish pretext by comparing herself\nwith two white employees who received promotions in place within\ntwo years of entering their current position. This argument fails to\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               35\nestablish pretext. Miss Anderson seeks to compare herself to employ-\nees who hold positions that are dissimilar to her own. The first white\nemployee, Craig Stripling, is an associate engineer who was promoted\nfrom SGL 28 to SGL 30 after working as an associate technical sup-\nport specialist for less than two years. The second, Michelle Trill, a\nhuman resources consultant, was promoted six times between 1989\nand 1995. These two white employees worked in separate divisions\nfrom Miss Anderson and had different responsibilities. Their promo-\ntions could be based on factors that may not be present in Miss\nAnderson’s position. The fact that the white employees received pro-\nmotions and Miss Anderson did not, when the job requirements and\nresponsibilities for the white employees are different from Miss\nAnderson’s, does not establish pretext.\n\n   Miss Anderson further claims that the rapid promotions of these\ntwo white employees occurred in violation of a Site policy that\nemployees do not receive pay increases unless they have been in their\ncurrent position for more than two years. Miss Anderson bases this\nclaim on a statement made to her by her manager that \"promotions\nwere not usually given until an employee had been in a position for\ntwo to four years.\" This statement, which contains the qualifier \"usu-\nally,\" coupled with the fact that Miss Trill and Stripling were pro-\nmoted without two years of experience in their positions, does not\nestablish pretext. Miss Anderson’s manager informed her of the usual\npolicy, but his statement reflects the fact that exceptions do exist.\n\n   Miss Anderson did not receive a promotion in place because her\njob responsibilities did not warrant such an increase. She has not\nshown us any evidence which suggests that this reason was a pretext\nor from which a jury could infer pretext. See Bryant, 333 F.3d at 544\n(noting that a jury could infer discrimination based on \"the lack of\nany real reason to deny Bryant the job\"). In this case, the defendant\nhas stated a reason why Miss Anderson did not receive a promotion,\nand Miss Anderson has been unable to controvert it.\n\n  We are of opinion that the district court did not err in granting sum-\nmary judgment to the defendants on Miss Anderson’s disparate treat-\nment failure to promote in place claim.\n\f36         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n                                   IX.\n\n   Miss Anderson appeals the district court’s decision denying the\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On appeal, she argues that\nthe district court erred by failing to certify two subclasses, one com-\nposed of black Site employees who were discriminated against under\nthe CBPS and one composed of black Site employees who were dis-\ncriminated against under the RP3 system. Miss Anderson is not a\nmember of either of the two subclasses. As we have discussed above,\nall of Miss Anderson’s claims, whether based on a disparate impact\nor disparate treatment theory, are without merit, and the district court\nproperly granted summary judgment to the defendants on each of the\nclaims. Miss Anderson voluntarily has dismissed the one claim which\nremained after the district court ruled on the defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment, the disparate treatment merit pay claim. Accord-\ningly, Miss Anderson no longer has any valid claims pending in this\ncase.In Cox v.

The plaintiff brought both individual and class action\nclaims. The district court proceeded to try the plaintiff’s individual\nclaims in a bench trial with an advisory jury without first ruling on\nthe plaintiff’s class action claims. After the bench trial, the district\ncourt dismissed the plaintiff’s individual claims after concluding that\nthe defendant had not practiced illegal discrimination. 471 F.2d at 14.\nThe district court then dismissed the plaintiff’s class action claims\nbecause the plaintiff, without any individual claims, was not a proper\nclass representative. The plaintiff appealed both rulings to this court.\n\n   On appeal, we affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the plain-\ntiff’s individual claims. 471 F.2d at 14-15. Turning next to the plain-\ntiff’s class claims, we noted the awkwardness of remanding the class\nclaims to the district court where the plaintiff, although \"finally\nadjudged not to be a member of the class he seeks to represent,\"\nwould nonetheless continue to prosecute the class claims in the dis-\ntrict court upon remand. 471 F.2d at 15-16.

At trial on the plaintiffs’ individual claims,\nthe district court found against the plaintiffs and denied their individ-\nual claims. 584 F.2d at 1329-1331.

Turning to the certification issue,\nthe court determined that the district court acted prematurely in\ndeclining to certify the class action because the district court ruled on\nthe certification question prior to the completion of discovery. 584\nF.2d at 1332. Following Cox, in Goodman we remanded the class\naction issue to the district court but instructed that the plaintiffs in the\nappeal might not pursue the class claims on remand.

WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n     Anderson appeals the District Court’s denial of certification\n     of two subclasses of African-American employees with\n     claims based on (1) the CBPS and (2) the RP3.\n\n   With respect to the RP3 claim, there is no indication or claim of\nany successful prosecution of that claim without the rejected testi-\nmony of Dr. Bradley, who was examined in open court by the district\njudge and the parties. The denial of the district court to certify a class\naction with respect to the RP3 procedure is accordingly affirmed.\n\n   With respect to the CBPS claim, we express no opinion on the\nquestion of whether or not some part of Miss Anderson’s claim relat-\ning to the administration of that system of career advancement or job\navailability may be a colorable class claim, although none has been\nshown here. We say this because of the decision of the district court\nwith respect to Dr. Bradley’s testimony in which it denied the motion\nto exclude the testimony \"from the qualified to the interview stage,\nand from the interview stage to the selection stage,\" but it granted the\nmotion to exclude the testimony \"from the pool stage to the qualified\nstage.\" Stated simply, the court held that the evidence did not show\nthat the Human Resources Department might have discriminated in\npreparing the list of those qualified for job openings but that the sta-\ntistical evidence might be admissible if it tended to show the possibil-\nity of discrimination in selecting those applicants who would be\ninterviewed and in selecting the person for the job from among those\ninterviewed.\n\n   While we express no opinion on whether or not the class action\nmay fail for want of commonality or typicality, we remand to the dis-\ntrict court the question of whether or not a class action should be per-\nmitted to proceed with respect to the \"qualified to the interview stage,\nand from the interview stage to the selection stage.\" Upon remand, if\na proper plaintiff or plaintiffs with grievances similar to those of Miss\nAnderson with respect to that discrete portion of the CBPS procedure\npresents himself to prosecute, himself, as a class representative, the\ndistrict court should then decide whether a class action is maintain-\nable and whether the then named plaintiff should represent the class.\nWe express no opinion as to the weight, if any, to give Dr. Bradley’s\ntestimony or whether it is admissible. If no representative plaintiff so\ncomes forward within a reasonable time, then the district court should\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.               39\nstrike the class action from the calendar and enter a final dismissal\nthereof.

The denial of a class action with\nrespect to the RP3 procedure is affirmed, as is the denial of a class\naction with respect to the CBPS procedure, with the exception of that\npart of the CBPS procedure noted just above. This action is remanded\nto the district court to keep the same on the docket for a reasonable\ntime, with instructions to determine if there is another plaintiff who\nwishes to maintain a class action under the principles established in\nCox and Goodman we have referred to.\n\n                                        AFFIRMED IN PART,\n                                         VACATED IN PART,\n                          AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n   I am pleased to concur in Judge Widener’s thorough and well rea-\nsoned opinion insofar as it affirms the district court’s judgment. But\nI cannot agree with a remand \"to determine if there is another plaintiff\nwho wishes to maintain a class action.\"\n\n   Because the plaintiff has no cognizable claim, she is not in a posi-\ntion to represent a class of others because either her claims are not\ntypical of the others or, if they are, the others’ claims likewise have\nno merit.\n\n   The problem that Judge Widener raises in Part IX would, in my\njudgment, be resolved just as well by some other plaintiff, not in this\ncase, alleging his or her own claim and seeking to prosecute it as a\nclass action. As for this case, I would consider it ended with our opin-\nion affirming the judgment of the district court.\n\f40          ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n   By remanding this case to the district court with no plaintiff, we\ncan only be inviting new claims — different from those that we have\nrejected in this case — to be filed on behalf of a new plaintiff and\nunspecified others. This is not the situation where a plaintiff’s claims\nhave been dismissed on a technical deficiency, and we would be\nallowing another plaintiff without that deficiency to continue the case.\nRather, we have a case where the plaintiff’s claims were dismissed\nbecause the claims themselves were deficient. In short, there is noth-\ning to perpetuate on remand.\n\n  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from Part IX and the remand\nremedy contained in Part X. Otherwise, I concur in this fine opinion.\n\nGREGORY, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n\n   Although I agree with most of the majority’s analysis, I write sepa-\nrately because I cannot concur in the disparate impact analysis con-\ntained in part VII(B). There, the majority affirms a grant of summary\njudgment against Ms. Anderson on her disparate impact claim despite\nthe fact that she produced evidence showing a statistically significant\nvariation between the number of African-Americans who apply and\nthe number who are successful at both the second and third stages of\nthe CBPS. The majority first finds that because Ms. Anderson’s evi-\ndence challenging the subjective nature of the second and third stages\nof the CBPS failed to control for all subjective variables potentially\ntaken into account in the interview and hiring decisions, she failed to\nestablish the causation element of her prima facie burden. Second, the\nmajority finds that even if Ms. Anderson had in fact satisfied her\nprima facie burden, her claims would fail because she cannot make\nthe requisite McDonnell Douglas showing that Westinghouse’s legiti-\nmate non-discriminatory rationale was mere pretext for a racially dis-\ncriminatory decision.\n\n   Because I cannot agree with either of these contentions, I respect-\nfully dissent from that particular part of the majority opinion.\n\n                                   I.\n\n     Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1991:\n\f           ANDERSON v.

See\nid. at 994. To make this prima facie showing, a plaintiff must (1)\nidentify a specific policy or practice, (2) demonstrate that a disparity\nexists, and (3) establish a causal relationship between the two. See id.\nat 994-95. Upon successfully presenting a prima facie case, the bur-\nden then shifts to the employer to \"demonstrate that the challenged\npractice is job related for the position in question and consistent with\nbusiness necessity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(a)(i); see Walls v.

WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                  43\n                                   A.\n\n   As noted earlier, the first step in establishing a prima facie case is\nthe identification of a specific policy or practice. Here, Ms. Anderson\nchallenges the second and third stages of the Competency Based Post-\ning System (\"CBPS\")1 as having a disparate impact on African-\nAmerican employees. Ms. Anderson specifically challenges the sub-\njective decision-making involved in each stage. The majority \"as-\nsumes arguendo\" that by challenging these stages Ms. Anderson\nidentified a specific employment practice.\n\n   In Watson, the Court addressed the issue of whether a disparate\nimpact analysis could properly be applied to subjective criteria.2 See\nWatson, 487 U.S. at 989. There, the Court held that \"subjective or dis-\ncretionary employment practices may be analyzed under the disparate\nimpact approach in appropriate cases.\" Id. at 991. \"We are persuaded\nthat our decisions in Griggs and succeeding cases could largely be\nnullified if disparate impact analysis were applied only to standard-\nized selection practices.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 989. The Court contin-\nued on to conclude that:\n\n     If an employer’s undisciplined system of subjective\n     decision-making has precisely the same effects as a system\n     pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination, it is\n     difficult to see why Title VII’s proscription against discrimi-\n     natory actions should not apply. In both circumstances, the\n     employer’s practices may be said to \"adversely affect [an\n     individual’s] status as an employee, because of such individ-\n     ual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C.\n     § 2000e-2(a)(2).\n  1\n    Specifically, Ms. Anderson challenged steps #9, #12, #13 of the\nCBPS.\n  2\n    In Watson, the Court noted that its disparate impact jurisprudence had\nalways involved cases in which standardized employment tests or criteria\nwere challenged. Id. at 988. For example, in Griggs the Court faced chal-\nlenges to high school diploma requirements and aptitude tests. Griggs,\n401 U.S. 301-02. Similarly, in Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109299\"><a href=\"/opinion/109299/albemarle-paper-co-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (1975), the Court faced challenges to aptitude tests. Finally, in\nConnecticut v. Teal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110751\"><a href=\"/opinion/110751/connecticut-v-teal/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445 (1982), the Court faced chal-\nlenges to written examinations.\n\f44         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nId. at 990-991.\n\n   In this case, I would find that Ms. Anderson did in fact satisfy the\nfirst element of her prima facie burden. Ms. Anderson challenged the\nsecond and third stages of the CBPS system, both of which entail an\ninterview panel subjectively rating qualified candidates across a num-\nber of subjective criteria. The second stage is a screening stage, where\nthe applications of applicants who are found to meet the minimum\nrequirements by the Human Resources department are forwarded to\nthe manager of the department with the opening. That person, either\nby themself or in conjunction with two others, then screens all the\napplications with \"core competencies\" (teamwork, leadership, com-\nmunications, employee development, business results and self man-\nagement) and \"functional competencies\" in mind, to find the most\nqualified candidates to interview for the position. The third stage of\nthe process involves the actual interviews of those candidates\nselected. Interviews are conducted by a three-person panel, during\nwhich each member of the panel evaluates the candidate in writing\naccording to the above criteria and any other relevant characteristics.\nAfter all interviews are conducted, the panel then selects who it\nbelieves is the best person for the position.\n\n    Ms. Anderson is not required to challenge a more specific aspect\nof the hiring process, particularly when she is challenging a subjective\nprocess. In Rose v. Wells Fargo & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541136\"><a href=\"/opinion/541136/william-rose-jr-orie-reed-v-wells-fargo-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1420, 1424-\n25 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit held that where \"[e]mployment\ndecisions as to which jobs would be eliminated and as to who would\nfill the remaining positions was essentially left to the discretion of the\nvarious bank departments,\" such a policy was a specific employment\npractice subject to disparate impact analysis, even where the manag-\ners were instructed to consider factors such as longevity and perfor-\nmance. Similarly, in this case, while those making the decisions in the\nsecond and third stages of the CBPS were instructed to evaluate can-\ndidates according to certain qualities, whether the applicants showed\nany aptitude for the guideline qualities was an entirely subjective\nevaluation. After all, how does one truly quantify or measure \"team-\nwork\" or \"communications\" without making a wholly subjective\nassessment?\n\n  In its attempt to distinguish cases such as Watson and Rose, I\nbelieve that the majority overstates the level to which the discretion\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                  45\npresent in this case was cabined by the process. Focusing on the Wat-\nson Court’s language describing subjective employment practices as\n\"unchecked discretion\" and as an \"undisciplined system of subjective\ndecision making,\" the majority argues that because the discretion in\nthis case was not unfettered, the holdings of Watson and Rose are not\napplicable here. The majority finds support for this position in the fact\nthat the decision makers were instructed to consider core and func-\ntional competencies when making their decisions. However, the\nmajority’s focus on the Watson Court’s language describing subjec-\ntive employment practices as \"unchecked discretion\" and as an \"un-\ndisciplined system of subjective decision making,\" is misplaced. The\ncrux of the Watson decision is that \"disparate impact analysis is in\nprinciple no less applicable to subjective employment criteria than to\nobjective or standardized tests\" because \"[i]n either case, a facially\nneutral practice, adopted without discriminatory intent, may have\neffects that are indistinguishable from intentionally discriminatory\npractices.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 990. Later in the Watson opinion, the\nCourt then repeated this position, stating \"[i]f an employer’s undisci-\nplined system of subjective decision making has precisely the same\neffects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimina-\ntion, it is difficult to see why Title VII’s proscription against discrimi-\nnatory actions should not apply.\" Id. at 990-91. The clear focus of the\nWatson opinion is not the degree to which subjective discretion is\nunfettered, but instead the fact that both objective and subjective\ncriteria can have deleterious effects that are indistinguishable from\nintentionally discriminatory practices. That was the reason the Court\nconcluded \"that subjective or discretionary employment practices may\nbe analyzed under the disparate impact approach in appropriate\ncases.\" Id. at 991.\n\n   Because I believe that the challenged practices are undisputably\nsubjective in nature, I see no reason not to apply the rule of Watson\nin this case, and find that Ms. Anderson identified a specific employ-\nment practice.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   Ms. Anderson was next required to show a causal nexus between\nthe challenged practice and the disparity. The statute itself mandates\nthat the plaintiff demonstrate that the employer \"uses a particular\n\f46         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact.\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(k); see Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112270\"><a href=\"/opinion/112270/wards-cove-packing-co-v-atonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n657 (1989)(\"a Title VII plaintiff does not make out a case of disparate\nimpact simply by showing that, ‘at the bottom line,’ there is racial\nimbalance in the work force.

See New York City Transit Auth. v.

As the\nCourt noted in Watson, the term \"disparity\" has \"never been framed\nin terms of any mathematical formula.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 994-95.\nFurther, the Court has never \"suggested that any particular number of\nstandard deviations can determine whether a plaintiff has made out a\nprima facie case in the complex area of employment discrimination,\"\nbut has instead endorsing a case-by-case approach. Id. at 995 n.3.\n\n   Ms. Anderson presented the testimony of Dr. Edwin Bradley,\nPh.D., CEO of Quantitative Research Associates. Specifically, Dr.\nBradley found that at the second screening stage, a statistically signif-\nicant under-representation (-6.64 standard deviations) of African-\nAmericans existed when the pool of applicants meeting the minimum\nqualifications for the posted position was compared to the applicants\nactually selected for an interview. J.A. 1645. Similarly, Dr. Bradley\nfound that at the third screening stage, a statistically significant under-\nrepresentation (-2.38 standard deviations) of African-Americans\nexisted when the pool of applicants selected for an interview was\ncompared to those selected for appointment. J.A. 1645.\n\n   Despite this, the district court concluded and the majority con-\ncludes that because Ms. Anderson’s statistical evidence failed to con-\ntrol for all variables that may have impacted the decisions made at the\nchallenged stages, it is insufficient to establish causation. Specifically,\nthe majority states:\n\n     \"This evidence does not show that the reason black appli-\n     cants failed to proceed at the interview selection stage and\n\f            ANDERSON v.

As the Supreme Court stated\nin Bazemore v. Friday, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111746\"><a href=\"/opinion/111746/bazemore-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), \"it is clear that a regres-\nsion analysis that included less than all ‘measurable variables’ may\nserve to prove a plaintiff’s case.

Therefore, requiring Ms. Anderson to account for every possible\nvariable that may have impacted the outcome goes beyond Supreme\nCourt formulations of the plaintiff’s burden in a Title VII disparate\nimpact case. In Watson, a case where the Court faced a challenge to\nsubjective practices, the Court required that the plaintiff \"offer evi-\ndence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in\nquestion has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions\nbecause of their membership in a protected group,\" and importantly\nnoted that its formulations have \"consistently stressed that statistical\ndisparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise such an\ninference of causation.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 995. Similarly, in Albe-\nmarle, the Court required the plaintiff to show \"that the tests in ques-\n  3\n   The Court’s decision in Bazemore has been read as allowing regres-\nsion analyses that account for the \"major\" factors.

In fact, the district\ncourt recognized that Dr. Bradley’s analysis demonstrated a \"statisti-\ncally significant variation between the number of African-Americans\nwho apply and the number who are successful at both the second and\nthird step of the CBPS process.\" J.A. 12228. As the CBPS process is\nset up, all candidates who made it to stage two of the process pos-\nsessed at least the minimum qualifications for the posted position.\nFurther, all candidates who received a stage three interview were not\nonly minimally qualified for the position in question, but were also\nfound by the relevant department manager to be the most qualified of\nall applicants. Yet despite this, Dr. Bradley found a statistically sig-\nnificant under-representation of African-Americans when comparing\nthe applicant pools to the successful candidates at the end of each\nstage.\n\n   Given these facts, I am at a loss to understand how the majority\nfinds that Ms. Anderson’s statistics fail to show that the stages in\nquestion select applicants for hire or promotion in a racial pattern sig-\nnificantly different from that of the pool of applicants. These statistics\npresent more than just a disparity in Westinghouse’s work force; they\npresent evidence that the challenged stages have caused the exclusion\nof African-Americans because of their membership in a protected\nclass. And this evidence, by virtue of the nature of the hiring process\nitself, controlled for the major factor in the hiring process that could\nbe controlled for, namely that of qualification. For example, despite\nthe fact that at stage three only the most qualified candidates are inter-\nviewed, Dr. Bradley found that African-Americans were under-\nrepresented in the class of those who actually received appointments\nafter interviewing. I recognize that this court is under no obligation\nto \"assume that plaintiffs’ statistical evidence is reliable.\" Watson,\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                49\n487 U.S. at 996. However, where a party shows that there is a statisti-\ncally significant under-representation of African-Americans success-\nfully completing a challenged subjective stage of a hiring process,\ndespite a number of qualified African-American candidates,4 I fail to\nsee how an inference of causation for the purposes of establishing a\nprima facie case of disparate impact has not been shown.\n\n   Additionally, by faulting Ms. Anderson for not controlling for cer-\ntain variables, the majority is in essence faulting her for not control-\nling for the exact factor that she is here challenging as causing a\ndisparate impact — the subjective aspects of stages two and three.\nThe majority states that \"[f]actors such as presentation in the inter-\nview, answers to interview questions, demeanor, and ability demon-\nstrated in the interview\" are factors that entered in the ultimate hiring\ndecisions, and that therefore in order to show causation any statistical\nevidence must control for these factors. Ante at 25. However, these\nare all subjective evaluations, and exactly what Ms. Anderson is chal-\nlenging. The majority points out that Ms. Anderson did not account\nfor the evaluation of core and functional competencies. But again, the\nevaluation of the core competencies, and any relevant functional com-\npetencies, is largely a subjective evaluation. While faulting Ms.\nAnderson for not controlling for these factors, the majority never\nexplains how such control would even be possible. As I questioned\nearlier, how does one quantify \"teamwork\" or \"leadership,\" such that\nit can be controlled for in a statistical setting. The very nature of the\nsubjective process challenged makes such control impossible.\n\n   As such, because Ms. Anderson identified a specific practice, dem-\nonstrated the existence of a disparity and established a causal nexus\nbetween the two, I would hold that Ms. Anderson did in fact state a\nprima facie case of disparate impact.\n\n                                  III.\n\n   Despite its belief that Ms. Anderson failed to satisfy her prima\nfacie burden, the majority assumes arguendo that she has and contin-\nues with its disparate impact analysis. According to the majority:\n  4\n  Especially at the third stage where all African-American interviewees\nwere considered to be among the most qualified applicants.\n\f50         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n     the question is whether the proffered circumstantial evi-\n     dence of discriminatory impact is sufficient to satisfy the\n     McDonell Douglas framework of proof . . . . Under this\n     framework the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie\n     case of discrimination. Then, the defendant must respond\n     with evidence that it acted with a legitimate, nondiscrimina-\n     tory reason. If the defendant makes this showing, then the\n     plaintiff must \"present evidence to prove that the defen-\n     dant’s articulated reason was pretext for unlawful discrimi-\n     nation.\"\n\nAnte at 26. After noting that under McDonnell Douglas the ultimate\nburden of proving intentional discrimination remains on the plaintiff,\nthe majority finds that Ms. Anderson failed to show that Westing-\nhouse’s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason was mere pretext for\nintentional discrimination.\n\n   In reaching this conclusion, the majority ignores the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Griggs, the impact of which was to squarely reject\nthe notion that in order to state a claim for employment discrimination\nthe claimant must make a showing of intent. As the Court stated in\nGriggs, \"good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not\nredeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as\n‘built in headwinds’ for minority groups and are unrelated to measur-\ning job capability.\" Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432.\n\n   Disparate impact and disparate treatment are two legally distinct\ncauses of action under Title VII. Disparate treatment requires the\nplaintiff to prove that the defendant had discriminatory intent or moti-\nvation. See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112145\"><a href=\"/opinion/112145/watson-v-fort-worth-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 986\n(1988). In contrast, disparate impact seeks to ferret out employment\npractices that are the functional equivalent of intentional discrimina-\ntion because they cause significant adverse effects on protected\ngroups, but have no deliberate discriminatory motive. Id. at 986-87.\nIt is important to note that while the Supreme Court has enunciated\nburden-shifting schemes for both disparate treatment and disparate\nimpact, the schemes possess critical differences that prevents one\nfrom applying either test in the other context. See Lex K. Larson,\nEmployment Discrimination § 8.01[2] (2d ed. 2004) (\"The principal\ncategory of suits to which the McDonnell Douglas formula does not\n\f           ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.                51\napply is that exemplified by the 1971 case of Griggs v. Duke Power\nCo.\"). As the Court noted in Watson, \"[t]he factual issues and the\ncharacter of the evidence are inevitably somewhat different when the\nplaintiff is exempted from the need to prove intentional discrimina-\ntion.\" Watson, 487 U.S. at 987.\n\n   McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), sets\nforth the Supreme Court’s burden shifting formula for dealing with\nthe problem of proof in intentional discrimination cases.5 Under the\nMcDonnell Douglas burden shifting formula, after the plaintiff estab-\nlishes a prima facie case, \"the burden then must shift to the employer\nto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\nemployee’s rejection.\" Id. Should the employer articulate such a rea-\nson, the plaintiff must then be afforded an opportunity to show that\nthe articulated reason was merely pretext for a racially discriminatory\ndecision. Id. at 804-05.\n\n   By finding that Ms. Anderson had failed to show that Westing-\nhouse’s articulated reason was pretext, the majority in essence held\nthat Ms. Anderson had failed to prove intent. However, in the context\nof her disparate impact claim, Ms. Anderson was under no obligation\nto prove intent. As the statute itself makes clear, where the employer\ndemonstrates that the challenged practice is job related for the posi-\ntion in question and consistent with business necessity, the plaintiff\nmay still prevail by showing the existence of an equally effective\nalternative practice that eliminates the disparate impact and that the\nemployer refuses to adopt that alternative. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(a)(2). Nowhere does the statute require a showing of pretext,\nbecause pretext points to intent. Therefore, the majority’s application\nof any such burden to Ms. Anderson is error.\n\n  5\n   See Lex K. Larson, Employment Discrimination § 8.01[1] (2d ed.\n2004) (\"Employers are, on the whole, too sophisticated to profess their\nprejudices on paper or before witnesses. The Supreme Court in McDon-\nnell Douglas, recognizing the necessity in most instances of reliance on\ncircumstantial evidence, laid down rules of proof under which direct evi-\ndence of discriminatory intent is not necessary to the making of a prima\nfacie case.\").\n\f52         ANDERSON v. WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER CO.\n                                  IV.\n\n   Disparate impact is more than a mere method of smoking out inten-\ntional discrimination. Disparate impact attacks a set of deleterious\nbehaviors that the intent standard fails to capture. By definition, the\nstandard attacks only those practices that have a disparate impact on\nthe employment opportunities of classes protected by Title VII when\nthose practices are not supported by a legitimate business justification\nor where the same end-goals can be achieved in a less deleterious\nmanner. Given the struggles of this nation, a practice that has a dispa-\nrate adverse impact on a protected class, and yet either has no legiti-\nmate business justification, or can be achieved in a less harmful\nmanner, is not a practice that we should allow to stand. Ultimately,\nthis is a recognition by society that these practices, and their effects,\nare harmful in their own right. To continue moving a healing society\nforward, any such practices must be attacked under Title VII with a\nlevel of vigor equal to that spent combating intentional discrimina-\ntion.\n\n   With its holdings today, the majority has made the mountain a\nplaintiff must climb to state a disparate impact claim harder to sur-\nmount. Not only has the majority in essence required the plaintiff here\nto prove causation to a scientific certainty, they have also forced the\nplaintiff to show intent despite the clear statutory and jurisprudential\ndictates to the contrary. As I cannot concur with either of these\nresults, I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
