GARZA and GARWOOD, Circuit Judges, and ROSENTHAL, District\nJudge.**\n\n          ROSENTHAL, Distct Judge:\n\n          Placid Oil Company (\"Placid\") appeals from decisions of the United States Bankruptcy Court\n\nfor the Northern District of Texas and United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas,\n\nraising two issues:\n\n          (1) whether the courts below erred in holding that Placid could not deduct the legal and\n\naccounting fees it incurred for ordinary and necessary business operations during the bankruptcy\n\nbecause Placid failed to prove the amount of the fees with sufficient specificity; and\n\n          (2) whether the courts below erred in holding that Placid must capitalize all professional fees\n\nand expenses incurred in connection with the bankruptcy without analyzing the underlying\n\ntransactions to determine whether the fees and expenses were currently deductible or amortizable\n\nover the term of the underlying transaction or activity.\n\n          For the reasons stated below, this court REVERSES the courts below and REMANDS this\n\ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                               Background\n\n          Placid operates oil and gas interests both domestically and abroad. In 1983, Placid and certain\n\n\n   *\n       District Judge of the Southern District of Texas, sitting by designation.\n\fwholly-owned subsidiaries borrowed approximately $1 billion. In 1985, Placid began attempting to\n\nrestructure these loans. A year later, Placid filed two lawsuits seeking to restructure its debt. In\n\nAugust 1986, the lending banks began foreclosure proceedings against Placid. On August 29, 1986,\n\nPlacid filed suit under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to protect its assets from foreclosure by\n\nrestructuring its bank debt.\n\n       Placid emerged from bankruptcy in mid-1988. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed Placid's plan\n\nof reorganization on September 30, 1988. In connection with the confirmation, Placid's lawyers and\n\naccountants submitted detailed fee applications to the Bankruptcy Court, which included billing\n\nstatements and descriptions of the professional services rendered. The Bankruptcy Court approved\n\nthe payment of over $7 million in professional fees and expenses that Placid incurred during 1986 and\n\n1987. Placid in turn deducted these fees and expenses on its tax returns. Some were for\n\nbankruptcy-related matters; many were for matters unrelated to the bankruptcy.\n\n       In mid-1988, Placid filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court to determine its 1986 and 1987\n\nfederal income tax liability under 11 U.S.C. § 505. In December 1988, the IRS filed administrative\n\nclaims for federal income taxes that Placid allegedly owed for 1986 and 1987. The IRS administrative\n\nclaim focused on two issues, only one of which is now before this court: whether Placid could deduct\n\ncertain professional fees and expenses paid in 1986 and 1987.\n\n       On May 3, 1989, Placid filed its initial brief before the Bankruptcy Court on the issue of its\n\nright to deduct professional fees and expenses. The Bankruptcy Court heard argument in March\n\n1990, and on May 15, 1990, issued its Second Revised Memorandum and Opinion. The Bankruptcy\n\nCourt ruled that Placid was not entitled to any deductions for bankruptcy-related or for ordinary and\n\nnecessary professional fees and expenses rendered during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n       The Bankruptcy Court opinion held that Placid failed to satisfy its initial burden of production\n\nto rebut the IRS' prima facie case. The Bankruptcy Court stated as follows:\n\n       Placid has not provided the Court with enough information to categorize the fees and\n       expenses of the debtor's professionals. Specifically, Placid has not properly defined categories\n       of reorganization expenses versus ordinary expenses.... Placid has failed to meet its burden\n       of production because it has not provided the Court with enough data indicative of Placid's\n       proper segregation of bankrupt cy-related capital expenses from the ordinary business\n       expenses.\n\fIn re: Placid Oil Co., 140 B.R. 122, 129 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1990). The United States District Court\n\nfor the Northern District of Texas summarily affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling that Placid did\n\nnot satisfy its \"burden of proving the professional fees were deductible current expenses.\" In re:\n\nPlacid Oil Co., 148 B.R. 464, 464 (N.D.Tex.1991).\n\n       On this appeal, t he IRS admits that the effect of the ruling below is to disallow some\n\ndeductible professional fees and expenses. However, the IRS seeks to uphold the rulings as to the\n\nbankruptcy-related and non-bankruptcy-related fees and expenses on the ground that Placid did not\n\npresent sufficiently specific evidence as to the amounts of the deductions.\n\n                                         Burden of Proof\n\n       The Bankruptcy Court, the District Court, and Placid all agree on the applicable burden of\n\nproof for the claim objection in the Bankruptcy Court. Once the IRS filed its proof of claim, it\n\ncreated a prima facie case as to the validity and amount of the claim. Placid then had the burden to\n\nproduce sufficient evidence that its professional fees and expenses qualified for ordinary and\n\nnecessary business expense deductions to rebut the prima facie case. If Placid produced such\n\nevidence, the burden would shift back to the IRS to show by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nPlacid's professional fees and expenses were not deductible. The IRS had the ultimate burden of\n\nproof. In Re: Fidelity Holding Co., Ltd., 837 F.2d 696, 698 (5th Cir.1988).\n\n       The IRS agreed with Placid and with the courts below that Placid was entitled to deduct\n\nprofessional fees and expenses that Placid would have incurred regardless of the bankruptcy. The\n\nissue is whether Placid met its burden of producing sufficient evidence as to such fees and expenses\n\nto rebut the IRS' prima facie case. If so, the IRS \"must produce additional evidence to prove \"the\n\nvalidity of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.' \" In Re: Fidelity Holding Co., Ltd., 837\n\nF.2d at 698. Once both parties have presented such evidence, the issue is then whether the fees and\n\nexpenses were currently deductible as an \"ordinary and necessary expense\"; amortizable as an\n\nexpense relating to an underlying transaction or occurrence with a useful life over which the fee or\n\nexpense can be spread; or allocated to basis as a fee or expense that relates to a transaction or\n\noccurrence which has no useful life. See, generally, Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation, §§\n\f25.35-.37; 25.45-.47; 25.56-.58 (1990).\n\n                                        Standard of Review\n\n        Courts of appeal set aside a bankruptcy court's factual findings when such findings are clearly\n\nerroneous; however, courts of appeal apply a de novo review to a bankruptcy court's legal\n\nconclusions. In the Matter of Luce, 960 F.2d 1277, 1280 (5th Cir.1992); In the Matter of Nicholas,\n\n956 F.2d 110, 111 (5th Cir.1992). In deciding whether a lower court erred in determining that a\n\nparty failed to satisfy its burden of proof, a reviewing court applies the clearly erroneous standard.\n\nBartmess v. Federal Crop Ins. Corp, 845 F.2d 1258, 1261 (5th Cir.1988); McDaniel v. Temple\n\nIndep. School Dist., 770 F.2d 1340, 1346-47 (5th Cir.1985); Tulia Feedlot, Inc. v. United States,\n\n513 F.2d 800, 806-07 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 947, 96 S.Ct. 362, 46 L.Ed.2d 281 (1975).\n\nA reviewing court may set aside a lower court's finding when the reviewing court has a \" \"firm and\n\ndefinite conviction that a mistake has been committed.' \" McDaniel, 770 F.2d at 1347 (quoting Oil,\n\nChemical and Atomic Workers Int'l Union v. Ethyl Corp., 703 F.2d 933, 935 (5th Cir.1983));\n\nBartmess, 845 F.2d at 1261; Tulia Feedlot, 513 F.2d at 806-07.\n\n                    Placid's Evidence as to its Professional Fees and Expenses\n\n         Placid provided the Bankruptcy Court with different kinds of evidence as to the\n\nbankruptcy-related and nonbankruptcy fees and expenses it paid its lawyers and accountants. The\n\nBankruptcy Court had the fee applications themselves, with detailed descriptions of the nature of the\n\nservices performed and the corresponding fee amounts. Placid took the fees and expenses of its\n\nprimary outside law firm, two other law firms, and two accounting firms, and allocated those into\n\nthree categories: substantive bankruptcy-related fees and expenses; procedural bankruptcy-related\n\nfees and expenses; and \"claims, operations, etc.,\" which encompassed ordinary business transactions\n\nand ongoing business operations.\n\n       Placid admits that it cannot establish the precise amounts of all the nonbankruptcy professional\n\nfees and expenses it sought to deduct. However, many of the professional billings are broken down\n\nby specific matters, such as the defense of cases in which Placid had been sued. As to these matters,\n\nthere appears to be little question as to the amounts or the nature of the underlying transaction or\n\fevent. Other professional billings for fees and expenses are not broken down into specific items.\n\nPlacid's allocations estimated the amounts of fees and expenses attributable to these matters. Placid\n\nalso provided supporting evidence as to the amounts and as to the nature of the underlying\n\ntransactions in the fee applications that the Bankruptcy Court had already considered and approved.\n\n          This court holds that Placid did provide enough information to meet its burden and shift the\n\nfinal burden of disallowing the claimed deductions to the IRS. The Bankruptcy Court should have\n\nconsidered the evidence as to the existence and amounts of the professional fees and expenses at\n\nissue. The evidence was sufficient to meet the IRS' prima facie case of nondeductibility and shift\n\nback to the IRS the burden of proving that the nonbankruptcy fees and expenses be disallowed. In\n\nparticular, the three-part chart broke down the professional fees and expenses into categories that are\n\ncapable of being allocated among currently deductible expenses, amortizable capital expenses, and\n\nexpenses that must be allocated to basis.** See, e.g., Record Vol. 2, Exs. 2-5, pp. 50-57.\n\n   **\n        These categories are:\n\n                  1.

Indopco, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, --- U.S.\n\n----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1039, 1044, 117 L.Ed.2d 226 (1992). In deciding whether a particular fee or\n\nexpense should be considered deductible, the Bankruptcy Court should consider a mix of factors,\n\nincluding (1) the nature of the fee or expense; (2) the relationship between the fee or expense and\n\nthe reorganization; (3) the person or entity who incurred the expense; (4) the form and structure of\n\nthe particular transaction; (5) whether the transaction was actually consummated; and (6) the ability\n\nof the taxpayer to identify with reasonable exactitude the functional steps of the reorganization to\n\nwhich the fees and expenses relate. Boris I. Bittker & James S. Eustice, Federal Income Taxation\n\nof Corporations and Shareholders, ¶ 5.06, 5-34 (5th ed. 1987); see, e.g., Woodward v. Commissioner\n\nof Internal Revenue, 397 U.S. 572, 575-79, 90 S.Ct. 1302, 1305-07, 25 L.Ed.2d 577 (1970)\n\n(examining nature of the claim and relationship of the expenses to the transaction); United States v.\n\nHilton Hotels Corporation, 397 U.S. 580, 583-85, 90 S.Ct. 1307, 1309-10, 25 L.Ed.2d 585 (1970).\n\n           The Bankruptcy Court concluded that all Placid's professional fees and expenses incurred\n\nduring bankruptcy were to be capitalized to an intangible asset, without the benefit of amortization.\n\n\n   **\n        (...continued)\n                         e.

Ongoing business operations\n\fThe Bankruptcy Court reached this conclusion in part by finding that certain fees and expenses were\n\ncapital expenses, but then ruling that these expenses could not be segregated from nondeductible fees\n\nand expenses.     On remand, the Bankruptcy Court should not bind itself by a sweeping\n\ncharacterization that Placid's bankruptcy proceedings were \"in substance\" a \"reorganization,\" with\n\nthe result that all Placid's bankruptcy-related fees and expenses must be capitalized to an intangible\n\nasset without amortization. I.R.C. § 368. On remand, the Bankruptcy Court should analyze all the\n\nfees and expenses to identify them as: 1) currently deductible; 2) amortizable over the period of the\n\nuseful life of the underlying transaction or event; and 3) allocated to nonamortizable intangible assets.\n\nSee The Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 32 T.C.\n\n43, 51-52 (1959), aff'd, 279 F.2d 368 (10th Cir.1960); see also, Woodward, 397 U.S. at 575-79, 90\n\nS.Ct. at 1304-07; Hilton Hotels, 397 U.S. at 583-85, 90 S.Ct. at 1308-09; Great Western Power\n\nCo. of California v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 297 U.S. 543, 546-47, 56 S.Ct. 576, 577,\n\n80 L.Ed. 853 (1936). For example, professional fees and expenses that are related to restructuring\n\na specific debt and therefore conferred a specific long-term benefit are to be capitalized with an\n\namortization period equivalent to the useful life of that underlying transaction. Included in the\n\nBankruptcy Court's task on remand is to distinguish between professional fees and expenses for\n\ninitiating and administering the bankruptcy proceedings, as opposed to those fees and expenses that\n\nare directly related to a particular asset or debt transaction.\n\n        Given the evidence Placid presented to the Bankruptcy Court, this court is left with the firm\n\nconviction that the Bankruptcy Court erred in holding that Placid did not sustain its burden to rebut\n\nthe IRS's prima facie case. Because it was error to hold that Placid did not sustain its burden, this\n\ncourt REVERSES and REMANDS. On remand, the Bankruptcy Court is ordered to reexamine the\n\nrecord to segregate among currently deductible, amortizable, and nonamortizable professional fees\n\nand expenses for the 1986 and 1987 tax returns. If necessary, the Bankruptcy Court should allow\n\nthe parties an opportunity to supplement the record to provide a more detailed categorization of fees\n\nand expenses, as outlined above.\n\n        REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\f\f",

Placid has failed to meet its burden\n       of production because it has not provided the Court with enough data indicative of Placid's\n       proper segregation of bankrupt cy-related capital expenses from the ordinary business\n       expenses.\n\fIn re: Placid Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1549598\"><a href=\"/opinion/1549598/in-re-placid-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1990). The United States District Court\n\nfor the Northern District of Texas summarily affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling that Placid did\n\nnot satisfy its \"burden of proving the professional fees were deductible current expenses.\" In re:\n\nPlacid Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1968037\"><a href=\"/opinion/1968037/in-re-placid-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464 (N.D.Tex.1991).\n\n       On this appeal, t he IRS admits that the effect of the ruling below is to disallow some\n\ndeductible professional fees and expenses. However, the IRS seeks to uphold the rulings as to the\n\nbankruptcy-related and non-bankruptcy-related fees and expenses on the ground that Placid did not\n\npresent sufficiently specific evidence as to the amounts of the deductions.\n\n                                         Burden of Proof\n\n       The Bankruptcy Court, the District Court, and Placid all agree on the applicable burden of\n\nproof for the claim objection in the Bankruptcy Court. Once the IRS filed its proof of claim, it\n\ncreated a prima facie case as to the validity and amount of the claim. Placid then had the burden to\n\nproduce sufficient evidence that its professional fees and expenses qualified for ordinary and\n\nnecessary business expense deductions to rebut the prima facie case. If Placid produced such\n\nevidence, the burden would shift back to the IRS to show by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nPlacid's professional fees and expenses were not deductible. The IRS had the ultimate burden of\n\nproof.

The\n\nissue is whether Placid met its burden of producing sufficient evidence as to such fees and expenses\n\nto rebut the IRS' prima facie case. If so, the IRS \"must produce additional evidence to prove \"the\n\nvalidity of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.' \" In Re: Fidelity Holding Co., Ltd., 837\n\nF.2d at 698. Once both parties have presented such evidence, the issue is then whether the fees and\n\nexpenses were currently deductible as an \"ordinary and necessary expense\"; amortizable as an\n\nexpense relating to an underlying transaction or occurrence with a useful life over which the fee or\n\nexpense can be spread; or allocated to basis as a fee or expense that relates to a transaction or\n\noccurrence which has no useful life.

The\n\nBankruptcy Court had the fee applications themselves, with detailed descriptions of the nature of the\n\nservices performed and the corresponding fee amounts. Placid took the fees and expenses of its\n\nprimary outside law firm, two other law firms, and two accounting firms, and allocated those into\n\nthree categories: substantive bankruptcy-related fees and expenses; procedural bankruptcy-related\n\nfees and expenses; and \"claims, operations, etc.,\" which encompassed ordinary business transactions\n\nand ongoing business operations.\n\n       Placid admits that it cannot establish the precise amounts of all the nonbankruptcy professional\n\nfees and expenses it sought to deduct. However, many of the professional billings are broken down\n\nby specific matters, such as the defense of cases in which Placid had been sued. As to these matters,\n\nthere appears to be little question as to the amounts or the nature of the underlying transaction or\n\fevent. Other professional billings for fees and expenses are not broken down into specific items.\n\nPlacid's allocations estimated the amounts of fees and expenses attributable to these matters. Placid\n\nalso provided supporting evidence as to the amounts and as to the nature of the underlying\n\ntransactions in the fee applications that the Bankruptcy Court had already considered and approved.\n\n          This court holds that Placid did provide enough information to meet its burden and shift the\n\nfinal burden of disallowing the claimed deductions to the IRS. The Bankruptcy Court should have\n\nconsidered the evidence as to the existence and amounts of the professional fees and expenses at\n\nissue. The evidence was sufficient to meet the IRS' prima facie case of nondeductibility and shift\n\nback to the IRS the burden of proving that the nonbankruptcy fees and expenses be disallowed. In\n\nparticular, the three-part chart broke down the professional fees and expenses into categories that are\n\ncapable of being allocated among currently deductible expenses, amortizable capital expenses, and\n\nexpenses that must be allocated to basis.** See, e.g., Record Vol. 2, Exs. 2-5, pp. 50-57.\n\n   **\n        These categories are:\n\n                  1.
