We affirm.\n\n                                    I. Background\n      In 1988, the plaintiffs sued the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE), the\nDirector of the ADE, the District's Board of Education (\"Board\"), and the District's\nsuperintendent under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging race discrimination in violation of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and violations of § 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. As the district court accurately summarized, the plaintiffs\nchallenged the following policies and practices within the District:\n\n      (1) the low number of African-American administrators, teachers, and\n      coaches in the district resulting from discriminatory recruitment and\n      hiring practices (¶ 6, 15); (2) the election of school board members on an\n      at-large basis (¶ 7); (3) the segregation of African-American and\n      Caucasian students resulting from standardized testing for class\n      placement (¶ 8); (4) a racial imbalance at Wilmot Elementary resulting\n      from the district's decision to allow students from the Wilmot attendance\n      zone to attend Hamburg schools (¶ 9); (5) the disproportionate\n      assignment of African-American students to special education classes,\n      and the disproportionate assignment of Caucasian students to Gifted and\n      Talented classes (¶ 10); (6) student discipline imposed on a racially\n      discriminatory basis (¶ 11–12); and (7) the disproportionate number of\n      African-American children held back in the first grade (¶ 13–14).\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Susan O. Hickey, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                           -2-\n\f      Plaintiffs requested both injunctive relief and damages based on the\n      above allegations.\n\nMays v. Ark. Dep't of Educ., No. 1:88-CV-1076, 2015 WL 4528935, at *1 (W.D. Ark.\nJuly 27, 2015).\n\n       The parties negotiated a settlement. On March 6, 1991, the plaintiffs dismissed\ntheir claims against the ADE and its director. On August 1, 1991, by agreement of the\nparties, the district court entered an order dividing the District into seven single-\nmember zones for the purpose of electing school board members. Thereafter, the\nplaintiffs settled their claims against the District's Board and its superintendent, and\non September 23, 1991, the district court entered a \"Consent Order\" disposing of the\nremaining issues raised in the complaint. In relevant part, the Consent Order addressed\nthe functioning of the District's GT program; it provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n             Beginning with the 1991–92 school year and continuing thereafter,\n      all Gifted and Talented Programs for elementary students, run by the\n      district, will be held exclusively at the Wilmot School. A number of\n      educational and desegregative benefits will flow from this arrangement.\n      By locating this program in the Wilmot [S]chool, many black elementary\n      students will be relieved of some of the disparate burden of busing/travel\n      which could attend their education in the higher grades since Wilmot\n      does not have an educational presence beyond the 6th grade.\n      Additionally, because of the special opportunities offered through\n      G & T, white and black students from throughout the district will be\n      encouraged to attend the Wilmot facility. The resulting influx of white\n      and black students from throughout the district for gifted and talented\n      programs will tend to desegregate the educational experience at Wilmot.\n\n       The Consent Order does not set forth a blueprint for the District's\nimplementation of the GT program at Wilmot. The District chose to implement a GT\n\"pull-out\" program in which GT students would be pulled out of their regular\nclassrooms for 150 minutes of GT instruction per week. Students attending other\n\n                                          -3-\n\felementary schools within the District—Noble/Allbritton Elementary\n(\"Noble/Allbritton\") and Portland Elementary (\"Portland\")—are bused to Wilmot one\nday per week for GT instruction. Sandra Oliver, the GT Coordinator for the District,\ntestified that a bus first picks up the Noble/Allbritton GT students at 9:15 a.m., then\npicks up the Portland GT students, and arrives at Wilmot at approximately 10:15 a.m.\nThe Noble/Allbritton and Portland GT students later depart Wilmot at 1:30 p.m. As\nthe district court noted, \"The GT program appears to have operated in this way—as\na pull-out program—from the 1991–1992 school year to the present.\" Mays, 2015 WL\n4528935, at *2.\n\n       The district court retained jurisdiction over the instant case to ensure\ncompliance with the Consent Order. In 1994, the District moved for approval of a\nzone plan to voluntarily annex the Parkdale School District (\"Parkdale\") into the\nDistrict. The City of Parkdale is located eight miles from the City of Portland and four\nmiles from the City of Wilmot; at the time of the annexation, it was a nearly-all-black\nschool. The plaintiffs did not oppose this motion, and the district court approved the\nrezoning on August 26, 1994. The rezoning added Parkdale to the Wilmot attendance\nzone, roughly doubling its size.\n\n       Ten years later, in 2004, the District moved to dismiss this case citing its\ncompliance with the court's prior orders or, in the alternative, to approve annexation\nof the Fountain Hill School District (\"Fountain Hill\") into the District. By agreement\nof the parties, the district court entered an order approving the District's alternative\nmotion to annex Fountain Hill but denied the District's motion to dismiss the case.\n\n       On March 9, 2005, the District moved for the district court's approval to rezone\nthe District into nine zones, modify the GT requirements, and permit intradistrict zone\ntransfers. The motion provided that the rural portions of the District, which included\nWilmot, had suffered tremendous population loss. According to the District, this\npopulation decline had \"resulted in an inequitable, inefficient allocation of students\n\n                                          -4-\n\fand resources throughout the district.\" The District asked the district court to modify\nthe Consent Order to relieve the District from its obligation to strictly adhere to\nattendance zones and operate the GT program exclusively at Wilmot. The plaintiffs\nopposed the motion. Following a hearing on the motion, the parties reached an\nagreement and submitted stipulations for the court's approval. The district court\nentered an amended order approving the stipulations on June 24, 2005. Relevant to the\npresent case, the amended order provides as follows concerning the GT program:\n\n      [T]he parties have agreed to defer any decision on this matter until after\n      the school board election in September 2005. In the event that the Board\n      determines that its elementary level gifted and talented program should\n      be modified, the Plaintiffs have agreed that they will support the Board's\n      decision, provided that it is justified by legitimate reasons of educational\n      benefits and financial feasibility. Any such changes shall be adopted\n      only after a public hearing is held upon at least 20 days notice which sets\n      out the proposed changes in detail.\n\n             Therefore, the Court finds that this matter is moot at this time and\n      hereby denies Defendant's motion as it relates to the modification of the\n      district’s elementary level gifted and talented program.\n\n     The case remained dormant until January 10, 2014. On that date, the District\nmoved to reopen the case and requested approval of the closure of Wilmot and to\nmodify the GT requirements. In its motion,2 the District argued that \"substantial\n\n\n      2\n       The district court held a hearing on the motion on June 10 and June 18, 2014.\nOn the second day of the hearing, the parties indicated that they wanted to hold a\nsettlement conference with a magistrate judge. The district court adjourned the\nhearing, and the parties participated in a settlement conference on August 18, 2014.\nThe parties failed to reach an agreement. As a result, Wilmot remained open for the\n2014–2015 school year. The District filed an updated motion regarding the\nmodification of the GT requirements and the closure of Wilmot for the 2015–2016\nschool year. This updated motion was the subject of the district court's order\napproving Wilmot's closure.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fchanges in composition of the [District]\" have occurred since entry of the Consent\nOrder in 1991. The District noted such changes as the consolidation of the former\nFountain Hill and Parkdale School Districts into the District. The District asserted that\nWilmot had experienced \"declining enrollment and increases in expenses.\"\n\n       According to the District's motion, it began discussions of closing Wilmot due\nto declining enrollment at a Board meeting on November 12, 2012. Thereafter, it held\na public forum on December 4, 2012, concerning the closure of Wilmot. At this public\nforum, which was publicized in a local paper, the public was permitted to comment\non the potential closure of Wilmot. At a February 11, 2013 Board meeting, the Board\nvoted to leave Wilmot open and combine grades K–1, 2–3, and 4–5 into three\nclassrooms. One teacher and one paraprofessional was assigned to each combined\nclass. A second public forum concerning Wilmot's closure was held on November 18,\n2013. At the scheduled Board meeting held that same day, the Board unanimously\nvoted to close Wilmot at the end of the 2013–2014 school year.3 The Board decided\nto give Wilmot students the option to attend either Noble/Allbritton or Portland.\nAccording to the District, \"[t]he Board's decision to close the Wilmot Elementary\ncampus is justified by legitimate reasons of educational benefits and financial\nfeasibility.\" (All caps omitted.)\n\n       The plaintiffs opposed the closure of Wilmot, arguing that no changed\ncircumstances justify closing Wilmot or moving the GT program from that campus.\nThe plaintiffs additionally argued that the manner in which the District conducted the\nGT program at Wilmot was not in compliance with the Consent Order. According to\nthe plaintiffs, this noncompliance caused Wilmot's declining numbers.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      As explained supra, the District ultimately did not close Wilmot after the\n2013–2014 school year due to the present litigation over the closure.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f        Following a two-day hearing on the District's motion to approve the closure of\nWilmot and to modify the GT requirements, the district court granted the motion. The\ncourt concluded that the District established that \"a significant change in\ncircumstances\" had occurred since the entry of the Consent Order in 1991. Mays, 2015\nWL 4528935, at *5. First, the court discussed the \"changing demographics in the area\"\nthat have \"hindered\" \"[t]he goals of the 1991 Consent Order.\" Id. The court focused\non the population downturn in the City of Wilmot, citing United States Census Bureau\nstatistics. Id. In 2000, the City of Wilmot's total population was 786, and \"[t]he\npopulation of 5–14-year-olds was 118.\" Id. In 2010, the total population declined to\n550, and \"the population of 5–14-year-olds dropped to 83.\" Id. The district court\nassumed, based on Wilmot's current enrollment, that the City of Wilmot's \"population\nhas continued to decrease since 2010.\" Id. The court found that the data indicated \"a\nconsistent downturn in population since the Consent Order was entered in 1991.\" Id.\nAccording to the court, the plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that the trend in declining\npopulation would not continue. Id. The court observed that the City of Wilmot's\npopulation loss \"appear[ed] to have prevented Wilmot Elementary from sustaining its\nenrollment and/or attracting new families with children to the area.\" Id.\n\n       Second, the court found that \"Wilmot's enrollment numbers have dropped\ndrastically since the Consent Order was entered, and its financial status has been\nheavily impacted as a result.\" Id. at *6. As a result, the court found that the District\nsatisfied its burden of \"showing that the continued operation of Wilmot is a significant\nfinancial hardship on the district.\" Id. The court explained that\n\n      [e]nrollment at Wilmot dropped from 81 students for the 2011–2012\n      school year to 59 students for 2012–2013. Enrollment further decreased\n      to 42 students for the 2013–2014 school year and increased to 49\n      students in 2014–2015. For the 2012–2013 school year, Wilmot operated\n      at a deficit of $206,063.98 with a per student expenditure of $10,303.19.\n      ([District] Exh. 15). The per student expenditure in 2012–2013 exceeded\n      Wilmot's per student funding by $3,492.61. ([District] Exh. 21). For the\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f      2014–2015 school year, with three combined classes of grades K–1, 2–3,\n      and 4–5, Wilmot operated at a deficit of $126,588.23. ([District] Exh.\n      16). Superintendent Max Dyson testified at the hearing that Wilmot's\n      yearly deficits are not sustainable. He identified the operation of Wilmot\n      Elementary as the primary source of the Hamburg School District's\n      financial deficits.\n\nId. at *5 (footnote omitted). The court compared Wilmot's enrollment and\nexpenditures with that of Portland and Noble/Allbritton. Id. at *5 n.6. In 2012–2013,\nPortland had an enrollment of 131 students and operated with a $132,499.96 surplus.\nIn 2014–2015, Portland operated with a $224,518.48 surplus. Id. In 2015,\n\"Noble/Allbritton operated with a $6,405.37 cost per student; Portland operated with\na $7,295.99 cost per student; and Wilmot operated with a $13,254.05 cost per student.\nId. Based on the comparison of the various schools' financial data, the court concluded\nthat \"[t]he goals of the Consent Order—that the educational experience in the\n[District] occur on a desegregated basis—are not being served by Wilmot's continued\noperation in the face of major financial strain to the [D]istrict.\" Id. at *6.\n\n       After considering the declining enrollment and financial considerations, the\ncourt addressed \"educational considerations.\" Id. at *5. The court acknowledged that\n\"the Wilmot students are currently testing at or near the same levels\" as the\nNoble/Allbritton and Portland students. Id. The student-to-teacher ratio is 8:1 at\nWilmot, while the student-to-teacher ratio is 19:1 at Noble/Allbritton and 18:1 at\nPortland. Id. Despite the smaller class sizes at Wilmot, the court found \"some\nindications that the combined classroom setting at Wilmot has presented challenges\nfor the teachers.\" Id. The court cited Board minutes showing \"that the Wilmot teachers\nfeel that 'there is not enough time in the day to teach both grades.'\" Id. (quoting\nDistrict Exhibit 14). From this evidence the court concluded that \"the combined\ngrades classroom configuration has put a strain on the teachers who are faced with\nteaching a full curriculum to two different grades every day.\" Id. at *6. The court\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fconcluded that \"combined grades are not an ideal situation where there are viable\nalternatives.\" Id.\n\n       Additionally, the court cited the District's \"concern[s] that the Wilmot students\nin these extremely small classroom environments are not being sufficiently challenged\nin terms of classroom competition and are not being exposed to other cultural\nviewpoints that might exist in a larger classroom setting\" and that the isolated nature\nof Wilmot's campus deprives the Wilmot students of \"the opportunity to participate\nin after-school tutoring, remediation, and other programs that are available at other\ncampuses.\" Id. at *5. The court concluded that Wilmot students would \"benefit from\nthe more desegregated, diverse environments that [Noble/Allbritton and Portland]\noffer\" and that such campuses would provide the Wilmot students with \"[a] racially\nbalanced and culturally diverse educational environment [that] was the goal of the\n1991 Consent Order.\" Id. at *6.\n\n       The court then focused on Wilmot's GT program, citing the District's evidence\nthat \"a handful of students have declined to participate in the program despite having\nbeen accepted.\" Id. (citing District Exhibit 65A). Specifically,\n\n      [f]or 2010–2011, it was noted that twelve students did not turn in forms\n      that would have given the school district permission to test them for\n      entry into the GT program. The transportation challenges for GT\n      students have likely contributed to a lack of participation. GT students\n      travel by bus to Wilmot, departing Noble/Allbritton at 9:15 a.m., picking\n      up GT students at Portland Elementary, and arriving at Wilmot\n      Elementary at approximately 10:15 a.m. The GT students from\n      Noble/Allbritton and Portland then depart Wilmot Elementary at 1:30\n      p.m[.] and return to their regular classes between 2:00–2:30 p.m. Due to\n      their participation in the GT program and the bus ride, Noble/Allbritton\n      and Portland GT students are absent for 1–2 hours of regular classroom\n      instruction per week.\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fId.\n\n       Based on the aforementioned evidence, the district court found \"that a\nmodification of the Consent Order is justified due to the substantial changes that have\ncome to the Wilmot campus in the 24 years since the Consent Order was entered.\" Id.\nThe court concluded that the Board's \"unanimous vote to close the Wilmot campus\nwas based upon legitimate financial and educational concerns\" and therefore found\n\"that the proposed modification to the GT program is suitably tailored to the changed\ncircumstances at Wilmot Elementary and will comply with the goals of the Consent\nOrder.\" Id. As a result, the court granted the District's motion for approval to close\nWilmot and amended the Consent Order \"to relieve the Hamburg School District from\nits obligation to hold its Gifted and Talented elementary program exclusively at the\nWilmot Elementary campus.\" Id. at *7.\n\n                                     II. Discussion\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the District failed to prove that \"the facts\nand circumstances as they existed in 1991 or 2005 had changed in a significant\nenough way that Wilmot should be closed.\" The plaintiffs also assert that the District\nacted in bad faith and \"willfully ignored most of the provisions of the 1991 [C]onsent\n[D]ecree and made material changes to the programs at Wilmot without seeking the\napproval of the district court.\"\n\n       We review \"the district court's modification of the decree for abuse of\ndiscretion.\" Smith v. Bd. of Educ. of Palestine-Wheatley Sch. Dist., 769 F.3d 566, 568\n(8th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).\n\n        \"Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes modification of\nconsent decrees.\" Id. at 570 (citing Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk Cty. Jail, 502 U.S.\n367 (1992)). This rule \"provides that a party may obtain relief from a court order when\n'it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application,' not\n\n                                          -10-\n\fwhen it is no longer convenient to live with the terms of a consent decree.\" Id.\n(quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5))). As a result, the\nSupreme Court has explained that \"a party seeking modification [must establish] that\na significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. If the moving\nparty meets this standard, the court should consider whether the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstances.\" Id. at 570–71\n(alteration in original) (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383); see also id. at 573 (\"The Rufo\nstandard has two essential elements, whether 'a significant change in circumstances\nwarrants revision of the decree,' and if so, 'whether the proposed modification is\nsuitably tailored to the changed circumstances.'\" (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383).4\n\n                      A. Significant Change in Circumstances\n      To satisfy the first Rufo element, the District had to \"establish 'a significant\nchange in circumstances,' not merely that 'it is no longer convenient to live with the\nterms of [the] consent decree.'\" Smith, 769 F.3d at 573. We have previously held that\n\n\n\n      dramatic demographic changes, significant cost savings, a projected\n      decrease in enrollment, a risk of fiscal distress noted by the Arkansas\n      Department of Education's Fiscal Distress Accountability and Reporting\n      Unit, \"academic shortcomings\" cited by the Department, and evidence\n      that placing all grade levels on the same campus would likely improve\n\n      4\n        The plaintiffs argue that \"the more rigorous test for termination of a\ndesegregation decree set forth in Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 490–91, 112 S. Ct.\n1430, 118 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1992),\" applies. See id. at 568. \"[T]he primary difference\nbetween [the Rufo and Freeman] standards is that the Rufo test lacks Freeman's\nexplicit focus on the moving party's good faith as to both past and future compliance\nwith the consent decree.\" Id. at 571. The plaintiffs acknowledge that, in Smith, we\nrejected the argument that Freeman applies to the modification of a consent decree.\nSee id. at 571–73. Because \"one panel of this Court is not at liberty to overrule an\nopinion filed by another panel,\" Brown v. First Nat'l Bank in Lenox, 844 F.2d 580,\n582 (8th Cir. 1988), the Rufo standard applies to the present appeal.\n\n                                         -11-\n\f      the academic performance of middle school students—together with the\n      court's finding \"that defendants have complied in good faith with the\n      remainder of the requirements set forth in the consent decree,\" were a\n      sufficient basis for [a] [district] court to conclude that [a] [school]\n      [d]istrict had demonstrated the requisite \"significant change of\n      circumstances.\"\n\nId. (emphases added).\n\n       Here, the district court cited factors similar to those considered in Smith,\nincluding (1) demographic changes, (2) fiscal considerations, (3) decrease in\nenrollment, and (4) educational considerations as a basis for concluding that the\nDistrict had demonstrated a \"significant change in circumstances.\" The question is\nwhether the record supports the district court's finding that these factors contributed\nto the significant changed circumstances. We will consider each factor in turn.\n\n                             1. Demographic Changes\n      As explained supra, the district court concluded that \"[t]he goals of the 1991\nConsent Order have . . . been hindered by the changing demographics.\" Mays, 2015\nWL 4528935, at *5. Specifically, the district court found that the data reflected \"a\nconsistent downturn in population [in the City of Wilmot] since the Consent Order\nwas entered in 1991.\" Id. The court found no \"evidence to indicate that this trend will\nnot continue.\" Id.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs admit that \"[the City of] Wilmot has been losing\npopulation over the decades.\" But they assert that the population decline is not\nsignificant because the District \"knew in 1991 that [the City of] Wilmot . . . was losing\nresidents.\" The plaintiffs argue that because the parties could anticipate further\npopulation decline at the time that the district court entered the Consent Order, the\npresent population decline does not constitute a changed circumstance.\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f       \"Ordinarily, . . . modification should not be granted where a party relies upon\nevents that actually were anticipated at the time it entered into a decree.\" Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 385 (citations omitted). A party who \"anticipated changing conditions that\nwould make performance of the decree more onerous but nevertheless agreed to the\ndecree\" must \"satisfy a heavy burden to convince a court that it agreed to the decree\nin good faith, made a reasonable effort to comply with the decree, and should be\nrelieved of the undertaking under Rule 60(b).\" Id. (holding that remand to district\ncourt was required to consider whether upsurge in inmate population at county jail\nwas foreseen by county officials, so as to preclude modification of consent decree\nrequiring single celling of pretrial detainees).\n\n       In support of their argument that the District anticipated the population decline\nin the City of Wilmot, the plaintiffs cite the testimony of Carlton Lawrence, the\nDistrict's financial officer. Lawrence previously served as Wilmot's superintendent\nduring the 1984–1985 school year. After the District annexed Wilmot during the\n1985–1986 school year, he served as the principal of the junior high school in\nHamburg. From 2002 to 2006, he served as the superintendent of the District.\nLawrence testified that \"[t]he population decline has been a plague . . . on the Delta\n[,of which Wilmot is a part,] . . . [for] the last 40 years, from the change in the\nagriculture.\" Lawrence explained that this change and population decline \"has affected\nschool districts and schools up and down the Delta area\" and described it as \"an\nongoing situation.\"\n\n      Lawrence's testimony shows that the District knew that a population decline\nwas generally occurring in the Delta at the time of the 1991 Consent Order.\nAdditionally, census data that the District admitted into evidence shows a 14.7-percent\ndecline in the City of Wilmot's population from 1980 to 1990—the year before entry\nof the Consent Order. Consequently, the District could have anticipated further\npopulation decline in the City of Wilmot at the time that the Consent Order was\nentered. On the other hand, the rate of decline was not readily predictable from the\n\n                                         -13-\n\fcensus data. The rate of decline is reflected in the District's Exhibit 26,5 which reveals\nthe following:\n\n\n                                City of Wilmot's Population\n Year                          Total Population               Rate of Decline\n 1980                          1,227\n 1990                          1,047                          14.7% decline from 1980\n 2000                          786                            24.9% decline from 1990\n 2010                          550                            30% decline from 2000\n 2013 (estimated total         531                            32.4% decline from 2000\n population for 7/1/2013)\n\n\n       As the chart demonstrates, the 14.7-percent decline that occurred between 1980\nand 1990 increased to a 24.9-percent decline between 1990 and 2000. The rate of\ndecline jumped to 30 percent between 2000 and 2010. As a result, we conclude that\nthe doubling of the rate of population decline in the City of Wilmot could constitute\na significant change in circumstances that the District could not have anticipated at the\ntime that the Consent Order was entered.\n\n                             2. Decrease in Enrollment\n       The district court found that \"Wilmot's enrollment numbers have dropped\ndrastically since the Consent Order was entered.\" Mays, 2015 WL 4528935, at *6.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n       Exhibit 26 consists of three charts from the U.S. Bureau of the Census: (1)\n\"Total Population for Arkansas Places by County: Vintage 2013\"; (2) \"Population By\nRace and Hispanic or Latino (of any race); Arkansas By Place: 2010\"; and (3)\n\"Population by City 1980–2000.\" (All caps omitted.) We have condensed this\ninformation into one chart to show the population decline in the City of Wilmot.\n\n                                           -14-\n\f      As with the population decline, the plaintiffs admit \"that the student population\nat Wilmot Elementary School has declined to the point where it had forty-nine total\nstudents in 2014–2015.\" But they argue that because the District \"knew in 1991 that\nWilmot proper was losing residents, [then] . . . it also knew that the school would lose\nstudents[,] too.\"\n\n       The testimony of Superintendent Max Dyson and supporting exhibits6 reveal\nthe following:\n\n\n                                  Wilmot's Enrollment\n                    Year                                Number of Students\n\n\n 2009–2010                                102\n 2010–2011                                87\n 2011–2012                                81\n 2012–2013                                59 or 60\n 2013–2014                                42 or 45\n 2014–2015                                49\n January 15, 2015                         48 (6–K, 12–1st, 7–2nd, 7–3d, 10–4th, 6–5th)\n\n\n       While the record lacks data showing Wilmot's student enrollment at the time\nof the Consent Order, the aforementioned data shows an approximately 53 percent\ndecline in student enrollment from the 2009–2010 school year to the 2014–2015\n\n\n      6\n       We have combined the data from the following exhibits to show the number\nof students attending Wilmot during the designated years: (1) District's Exhibit 15\n(\"Wilmot Elementary\"); (2) District's Exhibit 24 (\"Headcount Statistics Report\"); and\n(3) District's Exhibit 48 (\"Wilmot Elementary School: Achievement History and\nProjected Outcome\").\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fschool year. This tracks the acceleration in the population decline for the City of\nWilmot. Like the population decline, we conclude that the District could not have\nanticipated the rapid rate of decline in student enrollment at the time that the Consent\nOrder was entered; therefore, this factor contributes to the significant change in\ncircumstances.\n\n                                3. Fiscal Considerations\n       The district court also found that \"Wilmot's yearly deficits are not sustainable\"\nbased on District's Exhibits 15, 16, and 21, and Superintendent Dyson's testimony.\nMays, 2015 WL 4528935, at *5. The court found that \"[f]or the 2014–2015 school\nyear, with three combined classes of grades K–1, 2–3, and 4–5, Wilmot operated at\na deficit of $126,588.23.\" Id. (footnote omitted) (citing District's Exhibit 16).\n\n      The plaintiffs admit that \"[a]t first blush\" the district court's finding that Wilmot\ncould not sustain running a deficit of $126,588.23 \"seem[s] reasonable.\" Nonetheless,\nthey argue that the District's annual budget is $16 million, with a routine surplus of\n$2 million. From this data, the plaintiffs conclude that the District is a \"fiscally sound\nschool district.\" They further argue that \"[t]he [District] knew in 1991 that it would\ncost more to keep Wilmot open than to close it. Yet it agreed to keep Wilmot open\nnevertheless.\"\n\n       Superintendent Dyson testified about Wilmot's fiscal condition. In 2014–2015,\nthe student funding matrix set forth in the Arkansas Code Annotated was $6,521.00\nper student in taxpayer funding. Ark. Code Ann. § 6-20-2305(a)(2)(B) (2013 Repl.).\nThe District's Exhibit 22 shows that Wilmot operated with a $13,254.05 cost per\nstudent in 2015. Superintendent Dyson testified that, as a result, each student at the\nWilmot Campus cost the District $6,733.05 over the $6,521.00 in funding from the\nmatrix. Based on these figures, Dyson testified that Wilmot's yearly deficits are not\nsustainable:\n\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f      It doesn't matter what group you are in, what business, what\n      organization, you cannot sustain deficit spending. Deficit spending will\n      get you to the point of where you cannot operate. In school business\n      deficit spending that will get you to the point to where you cannot\n      operate within a period of years triggers what is called fiscal distress as\n      such and you lose your local control.\n\nDistrict Financial Officer Lawrence similarly testified:\n\n      Well, the bottom line is that there simply is not enough student funding\n      at—foundation funding, as the State called it, at Wilmot based on the\n      number of students to support a full faculty and full services for the, for\n      the student population there.\n\nLawrence also discussed Defendants' Exhibit 22 showing Wilmot's expenditure of\n$13,254.05 per student versus the much smaller expenditures per student in other\nDistrict schools, stating, \"Well, it just further demonstrates that the . . . per-student\ncost of operating an extremely small situation is a lot higher than the one that has\nhigher numbers of students.\"\n\n        This testimony does not establish that Wilmot's expenses have or necessarily\nwill produce a financial crisis because the District as a whole still operates at a\nsignificant surplus. Instead, it shows that the elimination of Wilmot would result in\na \"cost savings.\" See Smith, 769 F.3d at 573. The District would save almost $7,000\nper student by eliminating Wilmot, but this savings alone is not a sufficient\njustification for modification of the consent decree. In the absence of population and\nenrollment decline, see supra, and educational considerations, see infra, the District's\nfinancial concerns would not establish the required significant change in\ncircumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f                             4. Educational Considerations\n       Lastly, the district court found that educational considerations contributed to\nthe significant change in circumstances warranting a modification of the Consent\nOrder. On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge this finding, arguing that \"Wilmot is the\nhighest performing elementary school in the [District], which means that closing the\nschool is not based on legitimate reasons of educational benefit.\"\n\n        The district court did address the Wilmot students' academic performance. See\nSmith, 769 F.3d at 573. It recognized that \"the Wilmot students are currently testing\nat or near the same levels as students at Noble/Allbritton Elementary and Portland\nElementary.\" Mays, 2015 WL 4528935, at *5.7 After recognizing the quality\nperformance of the Wilmot students, the district court further explained why\nadditional educational considerations undermined the students educational experience.\nFirst, the court found that \"[t]here are indications that the combined grades classroom\nconfiguration has put a strain on the teachers who are faced with teaching a full\ncurriculum to two different grades every day.\" Id. at *6. District Exhibit 14 supports\nthis finding. It reflects Board minutes in which a teacher, on behalf of the Wilmot\nteachers, told the Board that \"there is not enough time in the day to teach both grades.\"\n\n       Second, the court credited the District's \"concern that the Wilmot students in\nthese extremely small classroom environments are not being sufficiently challenged\nin terms of classroom competition and are not being exposed to other cultural\nviewpoints that might exist in a larger classroom setting.\" Id. at *5. The plaintiffs\nassert that because the District produced no evidence that \"larger class sizes would\n\n\n      7\n        The District offered the testimony of Lisa Atkins, the Wilmot Elementary\nDistrict School Improvement Specialist, who explained that Wilmot is a \"needs\nimprovement focus school\" because it tested fewer than 25 students. Atkins testified\nthat \"last year there were 18 students tested at Wilmot grades three through five. So\nthere was not a minimum end of 25 students. So the school falls into a focus status.\"\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fbenefit Wilmot's students,\" the district court erroneously accepted the District's\n\"counterintuitive and evidence-free argument that Wilmot's student teacher ratio was\nso small as to be detrimental.\" But Superintendent Dyson explained that his opinion\nabout placing the Wilmot students in larger classrooms derived from Ted Sizer's\n\"Horace's Compromise,\" which is the theory of the \"student as learner, and teacher as\ncoach where students are put in learning centers and teachers . . . involve[] them in\nproject based learning.\" According to Dyson, \"that's where [he] made [his] decision\nthat five students in a classroom, the same five all year, no matter how well they are\nperforming\" are still being held back by the lack of opportunities.8 Furthermore, the\ndistrict court credited the District's concern that \"due to the isolated setting of the\ncampus, Wilmot students do not currently have the opportunity to participate in\nafter-school tutoring, remediation, and other programs that are available at other\ncampuses.\" Mays, 2015 WL 4528935, at *5. The plaintiffs have offered no evidence\nor argument to counter proof that the Wilmot students would receive these additional\neducational resources if transferred to another campus.\n\n       Third, the court found that \"[a]s to the GT program at Wilmot, each year for the\npast several years, a handful of students have declined to participate in the program\ndespite having been accepted.\" Id. at *6. The plaintiffs have not challenged the court's\nfactual finding that \"twelve students did not turn in forms that would have given the\nschool district permission to test them for entry into the GT program [for the\n2010–2011 school year].\" Id. But they do challenge the court's conclusion that\ntransportation challenges for GT students contributed to the lack of participation in\nthe GT program. They argue that the District never produced evidence that the\ncommute dissuaded eligible students from participating in the GT program. The\n\n\n      8\n        The District's desire for larger class sizes with greater diversity and interaction\nis legitimate but it is certainly not the only successful educational model nor\nindisputably efficacious for all students. Were the standard of review more rigorous\nthan abuse of discretion this consideration by the District would not be given much\nweight in determining changed circumstances.\n\n                                           -19-\n\fcourt's conclusion, however, is based on the testimony of District GT Coordinator\nOliver and GT Specialist Renee Treadwell. When asked to explain \"some of the\nbenefits that would flow from moving the GT program as it now is conducted at the\nWilmot campus to the Portland and the Hamburg campuses,\" Oliver responded:\n\n      The GT program would be housed at the home campus of the students,\n      therefore that would reduce the time out of their classroom instruction\n      and allow them to have the two hours to be in the classroom. It would\n      also permit them not to miss activities that they might miss due to the bus\n      ride.\n\n(Emphases added.) Additionally, Treadwell testified that, in her expert opinion, the\nDistrict's GT pull-out program at Wilmot was not the \"best practice[].\" She explained\nthat \"the added time that [the students are] out of their regular classrooms for the\ntravel [to Wilmot] . . . adds a burden to those students.\" According to Treadwell:\n\n      [I]f those students who are [at] Wilmot now were to go to either\n      Hamburg or to Portland when they're identified as needing the GT\n      services, they would only be out of their regular classroom for the 150\n      minutes as a pullout program. And there would not be the additional\n      missing of that classroom instruction.\n\n        In finding that the decline in participation in the GT pull-out program at Wilmot\nis a factor indicating a significant change in circumstances warranting modification\nof the consent order, the district court expressly rejected the plaintiffs' argument that\nthe now-existing \"pull-out\" GT program (instituted in 1991) \"has always been in\nviolation of the [1991] Consent Order.\" Mays, 2015 WL 4528935, at *4 n.5.\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs had argued that the Consent Order mandated that \"GT\nstudents from all over the district were supposed to attend school full time at Wilmot.\"\nId. The district court disagreed. First, it pointed out that \"the elementary GT program\nin the . . . District has historically operated as a pull-out program, even before the GT\nprogram was centralized at Wilmot.\" Id. Second, the court found that \"the Consent\n\n                                          -20-\n\fOrder was unequivocal in its requirement that students attend school in the attendance\nzone where their parents reside.\" Id. Finally, the court noted that \"the GT program at\nWilmot was operated as a pull-out program from 1991–2014 without any indication\nfrom Plaintiffs that they were dissatisfied with the program or that it was in violation\nof the Consent Order.\" Id.\n\n       The district court's analysis is sound. \"After 23 years of silence on the subject,\"\nsee id., the plaintiffs argument now that the low participation in the GT pull-out\nprogram at Wilmot resulted from the District's operation of the program in violation\nof the Consent Order lacks support in the record.\n\n      In summary, we conclude that educational considerations, while not particularly\nstrong, do provide additional support for the district court's finding of a significant\nchange in circumstances.\n\n            B. Modification Suitably Tailored to Changed Circumstances\n      Having concluded that the district court committed no reversible error in\nfinding a significant change in circumstances, we now address \"[t]he second\nRufo element—whether the modification is suitably tailored to the changed\ncircumstances.\" Smith, 769 F.3d at 573. \"Under Rufo, a court of equity's flexible\nauthority to modify a consent decree on account of changed circumstances includes\nthe authority to relieve the moving party of a consensual commitment that was\nessential to the original decree.\" Id. As a result, the district court may \"order a\nchanged-circumstances modification that effectively terminates the decree.\" Id.\n\n       Here, the district court approved closure of Wilmot and modification of the GT\nprogram as the proper modification of the Consent Order due to the significant\nchanged circumstances. We conclude that such modification is suitably tailored. The\nConsent Order began as an effort to ensure \"that the educational experience in the\n[District] occur on a desegregated basis.\" Mays, 2015 WL 4528935, at *6. The\n\n                                          -21-\n\fmodifications sought by the school district in light of the (1) demographic changes,\n(2) decrease in enrollment, (3) cost savings, and (4) educational considerations are in\nline with the initial Consent Order.\n\n       Because we conclude that both Rufo factors are satisfied, we hold that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in granting the District's motion to approve\nclosure of Wilmot and to modify the GT requirements.9\n\n                                 III. Conclusion\n      Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n      9\n        In reaching this holding, we, like the district court, recognize \"that Wilmot\nElementary is an important part of the [C]ity of Wilmot, and that the [C]ity will feel\na great loss with its closure.\" Id. at *6.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f",

We affirm.\n\n                                    I. Background\n      In 1988, the plaintiffs sued the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE), the\nDirector of the ADE, the District's Board of Education (\"Board\"), and the District's\nsuperintendent under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging race discrimination in violation of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and violations of § 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. As the district court accurately summarized, the plaintiffs\nchallenged the following policies and practices within the District:\n\n      (1) the low number of African-American administrators, teachers, and\n      coaches in the district resulting from discriminatory recruitment and\n      hiring practices (¶ 6, 15); (2) the election of school board members on an\n      at-large basis (¶ 7); (3) the segregation of African-American and\n      Caucasian students resulting from standardized testing for class\n      placement (¶ 8); (4) a racial imbalance at Wilmot Elementary resulting\n      from the district's decision to allow students from the Wilmot attendance\n      zone to attend Hamburg schools (¶ 9); (5) the disproportionate\n      assignment of African-American students to special education classes,\n      and the disproportionate assignment of Caucasian students to Gifted and\n      Talented classes (¶ 10); (6) student discipline imposed on a racially\n      discriminatory basis (¶ 11–12); and (7) the disproportionate number of\n      African-American children held back in the first grade (¶ 13–14).\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Susan O.

Ark.\nJuly 27, 2015).\n\n       The parties negotiated a settlement. On March 6, 1991, the plaintiffs dismissed\ntheir claims against the ADE and its director. On August 1, 1991, by agreement of the\nparties, the district court entered an order dividing the District into seven single-\nmember zones for the purpose of electing school board members. Thereafter, the\nplaintiffs settled their claims against the District's Board and its superintendent, and\non September 23, 1991, the district court entered a \"Consent Order\" disposing of the\nremaining issues raised in the complaint. In relevant part, the Consent Order addressed\nthe functioning of the District's GT program; it provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n             Beginning with the 1991–92 school year and continuing thereafter,\n      all Gifted and Talented Programs for elementary students, run by the\n      district, will be held exclusively at the Wilmot School. A number of\n      educational and desegregative benefits will flow from this arrangement.\n      By locating this program in the Wilmot [S]chool, many black elementary\n      students will be relieved of some of the disparate burden of busing/travel\n      which could attend their education in the higher grades since Wilmot\n      does not have an educational presence beyond the 6th grade.\n      Additionally, because of the special opportunities offered through\n      G & T, white and black students from throughout the district will be\n      encouraged to attend the Wilmot facility. The resulting influx of white\n      and black students from throughout the district for gifted and talented\n      programs will tend to desegregate the educational experience at Wilmot.\n\n       The Consent Order does not set forth a blueprint for the District's\nimplementation of the GT program at Wilmot. The District chose to implement a GT\n\"pull-out\" program in which GT students would be pulled out of their regular\nclassrooms for 150 minutes of GT instruction per week. Students attending other\n\n                                          -3-\n\felementary schools within the District—Noble/Allbritton Elementary\n(\"Noble/Allbritton\") and Portland Elementary (\"Portland\")—are bused to Wilmot one\nday per week for GT instruction. Sandra Oliver, the GT Coordinator for the District,\ntestified that a bus first picks up the Noble/Allbritton GT students at 9:15 a.m., then\npicks up the Portland GT students, and arrives at Wilmot at approximately 10:15 a.m.\nThe Noble/Allbritton and Portland GT students later depart Wilmot at 1:30 p.m. As\nthe district court noted, \"The GT program appears to have operated in this way—as\na pull-out program—from the 1991–1992 school year to the present.\" Mays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.\n\n       The district court retained jurisdiction over the instant case to ensure\ncompliance with the Consent Order. In 1994, the District moved for approval of a\nzone plan to voluntarily annex the Parkdale School District (\"Parkdale\") into the\nDistrict. The City of Parkdale is located eight miles from the City of Portland and four\nmiles from the City of Wilmot; at the time of the annexation, it was a nearly-all-black\nschool. The plaintiffs did not oppose this motion, and the district court approved the\nrezoning on August 26, 1994. The rezoning added Parkdale to the Wilmot attendance\nzone, roughly doubling its size.\n\n       Ten years later, in 2004, the District moved to dismiss this case citing its\ncompliance with the court's prior orders or, in the alternative, to approve annexation\nof the Fountain Hill School District (\"Fountain Hill\") into the District. By agreement\nof the parties, the district court entered an order approving the District's alternative\nmotion to annex Fountain Hill but denied the District's motion to dismiss the case.\n\n       On March 9, 2005, the District moved for the district court's approval to rezone\nthe District into nine zones, modify the GT requirements, and permit intradistrict zone\ntransfers. The motion provided that the rural portions of the District, which included\nWilmot, had suffered tremendous population loss. According to the District, this\npopulation decline had \"resulted in an inequitable, inefficient allocation of students\n\n                                          -4-\n\fand resources throughout the district.\" The District asked the district court to modify\nthe Consent Order to relieve the District from its obligation to strictly adhere to\nattendance zones and operate the GT program exclusively at Wilmot. The plaintiffs\nopposed the motion. Following a hearing on the motion, the parties reached an\nagreement and submitted stipulations for the court's approval. The district court\nentered an amended order approving the stipulations on June 24, 2005. Relevant to the\npresent case, the amended order provides as follows concerning the GT program:\n\n      [T]he parties have agreed to defer any decision on this matter until after\n      the school board election in September 2005. In the event that the Board\n      determines that its elementary level gifted and talented program should\n      be modified, the Plaintiffs have agreed that they will support the Board's\n      decision, provided that it is justified by legitimate reasons of educational\n      benefits and financial feasibility. Any such changes shall be adopted\n      only after a public hearing is held upon at least 20 days notice which sets\n      out the proposed changes in detail.\n\n             Therefore, the Court finds that this matter is moot at this time and\n      hereby denies Defendant's motion as it relates to the modification of the\n      district’s elementary level gifted and talented program.\n\n     The case remained dormant until January 10, 2014. On that date, the District\nmoved to reopen the case and requested approval of the closure of Wilmot and to\nmodify the GT requirements. In its motion,2 the District argued that \"substantial\n\n\n      2\n       The district court held a hearing on the motion on June 10 and June 18, 2014.\nOn the second day of the hearing, the parties indicated that they wanted to hold a\nsettlement conference with a magistrate judge. The district court adjourned the\nhearing, and the parties participated in a settlement conference on August 18, 2014.\nThe parties failed to reach an agreement. As a result, Wilmot remained open for the\n2014–2015 school year. The District filed an updated motion regarding the\nmodification of the GT requirements and the closure of Wilmot for the 2015–2016\nschool year. This updated motion was the subject of the district court's order\napproving Wilmot's closure.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fchanges in composition of the [District]\" have occurred since entry of the Consent\nOrder in 1991. The District noted such changes as the consolidation of the former\nFountain Hill and Parkdale School Districts into the District. The District asserted that\nWilmot had experienced \"declining enrollment and increases in expenses.\"\n\n       According to the District's motion, it began discussions of closing Wilmot due\nto declining enrollment at a Board meeting on November 12, 2012. Thereafter, it held\na public forum on December 4, 2012, concerning the closure of Wilmot. At this public\nforum, which was publicized in a local paper, the public was permitted to comment\non the potential closure of Wilmot. At a February 11, 2013 Board meeting, the Board\nvoted to leave Wilmot open and combine grades K–1, 2–3, and 4–5 into three\nclassrooms. One teacher and one paraprofessional was assigned to each combined\nclass. A second public forum concerning Wilmot's closure was held on November 18,\n2013. At the scheduled Board meeting held that same day, the Board unanimously\nvoted to close Wilmot at the end of the 2013–2014 school year.3 The Board decided\nto give Wilmot students the option to attend either Noble/Allbritton or Portland.\nAccording to the District, \"[t]he Board's decision to close the Wilmot Elementary\ncampus is justified by legitimate reasons of educational benefits and financial\nfeasibility.\" (All caps omitted.)\n\n       The plaintiffs opposed the closure of Wilmot, arguing that no changed\ncircumstances justify closing Wilmot or moving the GT program from that campus.\nThe plaintiffs additionally argued that the manner in which the District conducted the\nGT program at Wilmot was not in compliance with the Consent Order. According to\nthe plaintiffs, this noncompliance caused Wilmot's declining numbers.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      As explained supra, the District ultimately did not close Wilmot after the\n2013–2014 school year due to the present litigation over the closure.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f        Following a two-day hearing on the District's motion to approve the closure of\nWilmot and to modify the GT requirements, the district court granted the motion. The\ncourt concluded that the District established that \"a significant change in\ncircumstances\" had occurred since the entry of the Consent Order in 1991.

First, the court discussed the \"changing demographics in the area\"\nthat have \"hindered\" \"[t]he goals of the 1991 Consent Order.\" Id. The court focused\non the population downturn in the City of Wilmot, citing United States Census Bureau\nstatistics. Id. In 2000, the City of Wilmot's total population was 786, and \"[t]he\npopulation of 5–14-year-olds was 118.\" Id. In 2010, the total population declined to\n550, and \"the population of 5–14-year-olds dropped to 83.\" Id. The district court\nassumed, based on Wilmot's current enrollment, that the City of Wilmot's \"population\nhas continued to decrease since 2010.\" Id. The court found that the data indicated \"a\nconsistent downturn in population since the Consent Order was entered in 1991.\" Id.\nAccording to the court, the plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that the trend in declining\npopulation would not continue. Id. The court observed that the City of Wilmot's\npopulation loss \"appear[ed] to have prevented Wilmot Elementary from sustaining its\nenrollment and/or attracting new families with children to the area.\" Id.\n\n       Second, the court found that \"Wilmot's enrollment numbers have dropped\ndrastically since the Consent Order was entered, and its financial status has been\nheavily impacted as a result.\" Id. at *6. As a result, the court found that the District\nsatisfied its burden of \"showing that the continued operation of Wilmot is a significant\nfinancial hardship on the district.\" Id. The court explained that\n\n      [e]nrollment at Wilmot dropped from 81 students for the 2011–2012\n      school year to 59 students for 2012–2013. Enrollment further decreased\n      to 42 students for the 2013–2014 school year and increased to 49\n      students in 2014–2015. For the 2012–2013 school year, Wilmot operated\n      at a deficit of $206,063.98 with a per student expenditure of $10,303.19.\n      ([District] Exh. 15). The per student expenditure in 2012–2013 exceeded\n      Wilmot's per student funding by $3,492.61. ([District] Exh. 21). For the\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f      2014–2015 school year, with three combined classes of grades K–1, 2–3,\n      and 4–5, Wilmot operated at a deficit of $126,588.23. ([District] Exh.\n      16). Superintendent Max Dyson testified at the hearing that Wilmot's\n      yearly deficits are not sustainable. He identified the operation of Wilmot\n      Elementary as the primary source of the Hamburg School District's\n      financial deficits.\n\nId. at *5 (footnote omitted). The court compared Wilmot's enrollment and\nexpenditures with that of Portland and Noble/Allbritton. Id. at *5 n.6. In 2012–2013,\nPortland had an enrollment of 131 students and operated with a $132,499.96 surplus.\nIn 2014–2015, Portland operated with a $224,518.48 surplus. Id. In 2015,\n\"Noble/Allbritton operated with a $6,405.37 cost per student; Portland operated with\na $7,295.99 cost per student; and Wilmot operated with a $13,254.05 cost per student.\nId. Based on the comparison of the various schools' financial data, the court concluded\nthat \"[t]he goals of the Consent Order—that the educational experience in the\n[District] occur on a desegregated basis—are not being served by Wilmot's continued\noperation in the face of major financial strain to the [D]istrict.\" Id. at *6.\n\n       After considering the declining enrollment and financial considerations, the\ncourt addressed \"educational considerations.\" Id. at *5. The court acknowledged that\n\"the Wilmot students are currently testing at or near the same levels\" as the\nNoble/Allbritton and Portland students. Id. The student-to-teacher ratio is 8:1 at\nWilmot, while the student-to-teacher ratio is 19:1 at Noble/Allbritton and 18:1 at\nPortland. Id. Despite the smaller class sizes at Wilmot, the court found \"some\nindications that the combined classroom setting at Wilmot has presented challenges\nfor the teachers.\" Id. The court cited Board minutes showing \"that the Wilmot teachers\nfeel that 'there is not enough time in the day to teach both grades.'\" Id. (quoting\nDistrict Exhibit 14). From this evidence the court concluded that \"the combined\ngrades classroom configuration has put a strain on the teachers who are faced with\nteaching a full curriculum to two different grades every day.\" Id. at *6. The court\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fconcluded that \"combined grades are not an ideal situation where there are viable\nalternatives.\" Id.\n\n       Additionally, the court cited the District's \"concern[s] that the Wilmot students\nin these extremely small classroom environments are not being sufficiently challenged\nin terms of classroom competition and are not being exposed to other cultural\nviewpoints that might exist in a larger classroom setting\" and that the isolated nature\nof Wilmot's campus deprives the Wilmot students of \"the opportunity to participate\nin after-school tutoring, remediation, and other programs that are available at other\ncampuses.\" Id. at *5. The court concluded that Wilmot students would \"benefit from\nthe more desegregated, diverse environments that [Noble/Allbritton and Portland]\noffer\" and that such campuses would provide the Wilmot students with \"[a] racially\nbalanced and culturally diverse educational environment [that] was the goal of the\n1991 Consent Order.\" Id. at *6.\n\n       The court then focused on Wilmot's GT program, citing the District's evidence\nthat \"a handful of students have declined to participate in the program despite having\nbeen accepted.\" Id. (citing District Exhibit 65A). Specifically,\n\n      [f]or 2010–2011, it was noted that twelve students did not turn in forms\n      that would have given the school district permission to test them for\n      entry into the GT program. The transportation challenges for GT\n      students have likely contributed to a lack of participation. GT students\n      travel by bus to Wilmot, departing Noble/Allbritton at 9:15 a.m., picking\n      up GT students at Portland Elementary, and arriving at Wilmot\n      Elementary at approximately 10:15 a.m. The GT students from\n      Noble/Allbritton and Portland then depart Wilmot Elementary at 1:30\n      p.m[.] and return to their regular classes between 2:00–2:30 p.m. Due to\n      their participation in the GT program and the bus ride, Noble/Allbritton\n      and Portland GT students are absent for 1–2 hours of regular classroom\n      instruction per week.\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fId.\n\n       Based on the aforementioned evidence, the district court found \"that a\nmodification of the Consent Order is justified due to the substantial changes that have\ncome to the Wilmot campus in the 24 years since the Consent Order was entered.\" Id.\nThe court concluded that the Board's \"unanimous vote to close the Wilmot campus\nwas based upon legitimate financial and educational concerns\" and therefore found\n\"that the proposed modification to the GT program is suitably tailored to the changed\ncircumstances at Wilmot Elementary and will comply with the goals of the Consent\nOrder.\" Id. As a result, the court granted the District's motion for approval to close\nWilmot and amended the Consent Order \"to relieve the Hamburg School District from\nits obligation to hold its Gifted and Talented elementary program exclusively at the\nWilmot Elementary campus.\" Id. at *7.\n\n                                     II. Discussion\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the District failed to prove that \"the facts\nand circumstances as they existed in 1991 or 2005 had changed in a significant\nenough way that Wilmot should be closed.\" The plaintiffs also assert that the District\nacted in bad faith and \"willfully ignored most of the provisions of the 1991 [C]onsent\n[D]ecree and made material changes to the programs at Wilmot without seeking the\napproval of the district court.\"\n\n       We review \"the district court's modification of the decree for abuse of\ndiscretion.\" Smith v.

(emphases added).\n\n       Here, the district court cited factors similar to those considered in Smith,\nincluding (1) demographic changes, (2) fiscal considerations, (3) decrease in\nenrollment, and (4) educational considerations as a basis for concluding that the\nDistrict had demonstrated a \"significant change in circumstances.\" The question is\nwhether the record supports the district court's finding that these factors contributed\nto the significant changed circumstances. We will consider each factor in turn.\n\n                             1. Demographic Changes\n      As explained supra, the district court concluded that \"[t]he goals of the 1991\nConsent Order have . . . been hindered by the changing demographics.\" Mays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. Specifically, the district court found that the data reflected \"a\nconsistent downturn in population [in the City of Wilmot] since the Consent Order\nwas entered in 1991.\" Id. The court found no \"evidence to indicate that this trend will\nnot continue.\" Id.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs admit that \"[the City of] Wilmot has been losing\npopulation over the decades.\" But they assert that the population decline is not\nsignificant because the District \"knew in 1991 that [the City of] Wilmot . . . was losing\nresidents.\" The plaintiffs argue that because the parties could anticipate further\npopulation decline at the time that the district court entered the Consent Order, the\npresent population decline does not constitute a changed circumstance.\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f       \"Ordinarily, . . . modification should not be granted where a party relies upon\nevents that actually were anticipated at the time it entered into a decree.\" Rufo, 502\nU.S. at 385 (citations omitted). A party who \"anticipated changing conditions that\nwould make performance of the decree more onerous but nevertheless agreed to the\ndecree\" must \"satisfy a heavy burden to convince a court that it agreed to the decree\nin good faith, made a reasonable effort to comply with the decree, and should be\nrelieved of the undertaking under Rule 60(b).\" Id. (holding that remand to district\ncourt was required to consider whether upsurge in inmate population at county jail\nwas foreseen by county officials, so as to preclude modification of consent decree\nrequiring single celling of pretrial detainees).\n\n       In support of their argument that the District anticipated the population decline\nin the City of Wilmot, the plaintiffs cite the testimony of Carlton Lawrence, the\nDistrict's financial officer. Lawrence previously served as Wilmot's superintendent\nduring the 1984–1985 school year. After the District annexed Wilmot during the\n1985–1986 school year, he served as the principal of the junior high school in\nHamburg. From 2002 to 2006, he served as the superintendent of the District.\nLawrence testified that \"[t]he population decline has been a plague . . . on the Delta\n[,of which Wilmot is a part,] . . . [for] the last 40 years, from the change in the\nagriculture.\" Lawrence explained that this change and population decline \"has affected\nschool districts and schools up and down the Delta area\" and described it as \"an\nongoing situation.\"\n\n      Lawrence's testimony shows that the District knew that a population decline\nwas generally occurring in the Delta at the time of the 1991 Consent Order.\nAdditionally, census data that the District admitted into evidence shows a 14.7-percent\ndecline in the City of Wilmot's population from 1980 to 1990—the year before entry\nof the Consent Order. Consequently, the District could have anticipated further\npopulation decline in the City of Wilmot at the time that the Consent Order was\nentered. On the other hand, the rate of decline was not readily predictable from the\n\n                                         -13-\n\fcensus data. The rate of decline is reflected in the District's Exhibit 26,5 which reveals\nthe following:\n\n\n                                City of Wilmot's Population\n Year                          Total Population               Rate of Decline\n 1980                          1,227\n 1990                          1,047                          14.7% decline from 1980\n 2000                          786                            24.9% decline from 1990\n 2010                          550                            30% decline from 2000\n 2013 (estimated total         531                            32.4% decline from 2000\n population for 7/1/2013)\n\n\n       As the chart demonstrates, the 14.7-percent decline that occurred between 1980\nand 1990 increased to a 24.9-percent decline between 1990 and 2000. The rate of\ndecline jumped to 30 percent between 2000 and 2010. As a result, we conclude that\nthe doubling of the rate of population decline in the City of Wilmot could constitute\na significant change in circumstances that the District could not have anticipated at the\ntime that the Consent Order was entered.\n\n                             2. Decrease in Enrollment\n       The district court found that \"Wilmot's enrollment numbers have dropped\ndrastically since the Consent Order was entered.\" Mays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n       Exhibit 26 consists of three charts from the U.S. Bureau of the Census: (1)\n\"Total Population for Arkansas Places by County: Vintage 2013\"; (2) \"Population By\nRace and Hispanic or Latino (of any race); Arkansas By Place: 2010\"; and (3)\n\"Population by City 1980–2000.\" (All caps omitted.) We have condensed this\ninformation into one chart to show the population decline in the City of Wilmot.\n\n                                           -14-\n\f      As with the population decline, the plaintiffs admit \"that the student population\nat Wilmot Elementary School has declined to the point where it had forty-nine total\nstudents in 2014–2015.\" But they argue that because the District \"knew in 1991 that\nWilmot proper was losing residents, [then] . . . it also knew that the school would lose\nstudents[,] too.\"\n\n       The testimony of Superintendent Max Dyson and supporting exhibits6 reveal\nthe following:\n\n\n                                  Wilmot's Enrollment\n                    Year                                Number of Students\n\n\n 2009–2010                                102\n 2010–2011                                87\n 2011–2012                                81\n 2012–2013                                59 or 60\n 2013–2014                                42 or 45\n 2014–2015                                49\n January 15, 2015                         48 (6–K, 12–1st, 7–2nd, 7–3d, 10–4th, 6–5th)\n\n\n       While the record lacks data showing Wilmot's student enrollment at the time\nof the Consent Order, the aforementioned data shows an approximately 53 percent\ndecline in student enrollment from the 2009–2010 school year to the 2014–2015\n\n\n      6\n       We have combined the data from the following exhibits to show the number\nof students attending Wilmot during the designated years: (1) District's Exhibit 15\n(\"Wilmot Elementary\"); (2) District's Exhibit 24 (\"Headcount Statistics Report\"); and\n(3) District's Exhibit 48 (\"Wilmot Elementary School: Achievement History and\nProjected Outcome\").\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fschool year. This tracks the acceleration in the population decline for the City of\nWilmot. Like the population decline, we conclude that the District could not have\nanticipated the rapid rate of decline in student enrollment at the time that the Consent\nOrder was entered; therefore, this factor contributes to the significant change in\ncircumstances.\n\n                                3. Fiscal Considerations\n       The district court also found that \"Wilmot's yearly deficits are not sustainable\"\nbased on District's Exhibits 15, 16, and 21, and Superintendent Dyson's testimony.\nMays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. The court found that \"[f]or the 2014–2015 school\nyear, with three combined classes of grades K–1, 2–3, and 4–5, Wilmot operated at\na deficit of $126,588.23.\" Id. (footnote omitted) (citing District's Exhibit 16).\n\n      The plaintiffs admit that \"[a]t first blush\" the district court's finding that Wilmot\ncould not sustain running a deficit of $126,588.23 \"seem[s] reasonable.\" Nonetheless,\nthey argue that the District's annual budget is $16 million, with a routine surplus of\n$2 million. From this data, the plaintiffs conclude that the District is a \"fiscally sound\nschool district.\" They further argue that \"[t]he [District] knew in 1991 that it would\ncost more to keep Wilmot open than to close it. Yet it agreed to keep Wilmot open\nnevertheless.\"\n\n       Superintendent Dyson testified about Wilmot's fiscal condition. In 2014–2015,\nthe student funding matrix set forth in the Arkansas Code Annotated was $6,521.00\nper student in taxpayer funding. Ark. Code Ann. § 6-20-2305(a)(2)(B) (2013 Repl.).\nThe District's Exhibit 22 shows that Wilmot operated with a $13,254.05 cost per\nstudent in 2015. Superintendent Dyson testified that, as a result, each student at the\nWilmot Campus cost the District $6,733.05 over the $6,521.00 in funding from the\nmatrix. Based on these figures, Dyson testified that Wilmot's yearly deficits are not\nsustainable:\n\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f      It doesn't matter what group you are in, what business, what\n      organization, you cannot sustain deficit spending. Deficit spending will\n      get you to the point of where you cannot operate. In school business\n      deficit spending that will get you to the point to where you cannot\n      operate within a period of years triggers what is called fiscal distress as\n      such and you lose your local control.\n\nDistrict Financial Officer Lawrence similarly testified:\n\n      Well, the bottom line is that there simply is not enough student funding\n      at—foundation funding, as the State called it, at Wilmot based on the\n      number of students to support a full faculty and full services for the, for\n      the student population there.\n\nLawrence also discussed Defendants' Exhibit 22 showing Wilmot's expenditure of\n$13,254.05 per student versus the much smaller expenditures per student in other\nDistrict schools, stating, \"Well, it just further demonstrates that the . . . per-student\ncost of operating an extremely small situation is a lot higher than the one that has\nhigher numbers of students.\"\n\n        This testimony does not establish that Wilmot's expenses have or necessarily\nwill produce a financial crisis because the District as a whole still operates at a\nsignificant surplus. Instead, it shows that the elimination of Wilmot would result in\na \"cost savings.\" See Smith, 769 F.3d at 573. The District would save almost $7,000\nper student by eliminating Wilmot, but this savings alone is not a sufficient\njustification for modification of the consent decree. In the absence of population and\nenrollment decline, see supra, and educational considerations, see infra, the District's\nfinancial concerns would not establish the required significant change in\ncircumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f                             4. Educational Considerations\n       Lastly, the district court found that educational considerations contributed to\nthe significant change in circumstances warranting a modification of the Consent\nOrder. On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge this finding, arguing that \"Wilmot is the\nhighest performing elementary school in the [District], which means that closing the\nschool is not based on legitimate reasons of educational benefit.\"\n\n        The district court did address the Wilmot students' academic performance. See\nSmith, 769 F.3d at 573. It recognized that \"the Wilmot students are currently testing\nat or near the same levels as students at Noble/Allbritton Elementary and Portland\nElementary.\" Mays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.7 After recognizing the quality\nperformance of the Wilmot students, the district court further explained why\nadditional educational considerations undermined the students educational experience.\nFirst, the court found that \"[t]here are indications that the combined grades classroom\nconfiguration has put a strain on the teachers who are faced with teaching a full\ncurriculum to two different grades every day.\" Id. at *6. District Exhibit 14 supports\nthis finding. It reflects Board minutes in which a teacher, on behalf of the Wilmot\nteachers, told the Board that \"there is not enough time in the day to teach both grades.\"\n\n       Second, the court credited the District's \"concern that the Wilmot students in\nthese extremely small classroom environments are not being sufficiently challenged\nin terms of classroom competition and are not being exposed to other cultural\nviewpoints that might exist in a larger classroom setting.\" Id. at *5. The plaintiffs\nassert that because the District produced no evidence that \"larger class sizes would\n\n\n      7\n        The District offered the testimony of Lisa Atkins, the Wilmot Elementary\nDistrict School Improvement Specialist, who explained that Wilmot is a \"needs\nimprovement focus school\" because it tested fewer than 25 students. Atkins testified\nthat \"last year there were 18 students tested at Wilmot grades three through five. So\nthere was not a minimum end of 25 students. So the school falls into a focus status.\"\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fbenefit Wilmot's students,\" the district court erroneously accepted the District's\n\"counterintuitive and evidence-free argument that Wilmot's student teacher ratio was\nso small as to be detrimental.\" But Superintendent Dyson explained that his opinion\nabout placing the Wilmot students in larger classrooms derived from Ted Sizer's\n\"Horace's Compromise,\" which is the theory of the \"student as learner, and teacher as\ncoach where students are put in learning centers and teachers . . . involve[] them in\nproject based learning.\" According to Dyson, \"that's where [he] made [his] decision\nthat five students in a classroom, the same five all year, no matter how well they are\nperforming\" are still being held back by the lack of opportunities.8 Furthermore, the\ndistrict court credited the District's concern that \"due to the isolated setting of the\ncampus, Wilmot students do not currently have the opportunity to participate in\nafter-school tutoring, remediation, and other programs that are available at other\ncampuses.\" Mays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. The plaintiffs have offered no evidence\nor argument to counter proof that the Wilmot students would receive these additional\neducational resources if transferred to another campus.\n\n       Third, the court found that \"[a]s to the GT program at Wilmot, each year for the\npast several years, a handful of students have declined to participate in the program\ndespite having been accepted.\" Id. at *6. The plaintiffs have not challenged the court's\nfactual finding that \"twelve students did not turn in forms that would have given the\nschool district permission to test them for entry into the GT program [for the\n2010–2011 school year].\" Id. But they do challenge the court's conclusion that\ntransportation challenges for GT students contributed to the lack of participation in\nthe GT program. They argue that the District never produced evidence that the\ncommute dissuaded eligible students from participating in the GT program. The\n\n\n      8\n        The District's desire for larger class sizes with greater diversity and interaction\nis legitimate but it is certainly not the only successful educational model nor\nindisputably efficacious for all students. Were the standard of review more rigorous\nthan abuse of discretion this consideration by the District would not be given much\nweight in determining changed circumstances.\n\n                                           -19-\n\fcourt's conclusion, however, is based on the testimony of District GT Coordinator\nOliver and GT Specialist Renee Treadwell. When asked to explain \"some of the\nbenefits that would flow from moving the GT program as it now is conducted at the\nWilmot campus to the Portland and the Hamburg campuses,\" Oliver responded:\n\n      The GT program would be housed at the home campus of the students,\n      therefore that would reduce the time out of their classroom instruction\n      and allow them to have the two hours to be in the classroom. It would\n      also permit them not to miss activities that they might miss due to the bus\n      ride.\n\n(Emphases added.) Additionally, Treadwell testified that, in her expert opinion, the\nDistrict's GT pull-out program at Wilmot was not the \"best practice[].\" She explained\nthat \"the added time that [the students are] out of their regular classrooms for the\ntravel [to Wilmot] . . . adds a burden to those students.\" According to Treadwell:\n\n      [I]f those students who are [at] Wilmot now were to go to either\n      Hamburg or to Portland when they're identified as needing the GT\n      services, they would only be out of their regular classroom for the 150\n      minutes as a pullout program. And there would not be the additional\n      missing of that classroom instruction.\n\n        In finding that the decline in participation in the GT pull-out program at Wilmot\nis a factor indicating a significant change in circumstances warranting modification\nof the consent order, the district court expressly rejected the plaintiffs' argument that\nthe now-existing \"pull-out\" GT program (instituted in 1991) \"has always been in\nviolation of the [1991] Consent Order.\" Mays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 n.5.\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs had argued that the Consent Order mandated that \"GT\nstudents from all over the district were supposed to attend school full time at Wilmot.\"\nId. The district court disagreed. First, it pointed out that \"the elementary GT program\nin the . . . District has historically operated as a pull-out program, even before the GT\nprogram was centralized at Wilmot.\" Id. Second, the court found that \"the Consent\n\n                                          -20-\n\fOrder was unequivocal in its requirement that students attend school in the attendance\nzone where their parents reside.\" Id. Finally, the court noted that \"the GT program at\nWilmot was operated as a pull-out program from 1991–2014 without any indication\nfrom Plaintiffs that they were dissatisfied with the program or that it was in violation\nof the Consent Order.\" Id.\n\n       The district court's analysis is sound. \"After 23 years of silence on the subject,\"\nsee id., the plaintiffs argument now that the low participation in the GT pull-out\nprogram at Wilmot resulted from the District's operation of the program in violation\nof the Consent Order lacks support in the record.\n\n      In summary, we conclude that educational considerations, while not particularly\nstrong, do provide additional support for the district court's finding of a significant\nchange in circumstances.\n\n            B. Modification Suitably Tailored to Changed Circumstances\n      Having concluded that the district court committed no reversible error in\nfinding a significant change in circumstances, we now address \"[t]he second\nRufo element—whether the modification is suitably tailored to the changed\ncircumstances.\" Smith, 769 F.3d at 573. \"Under Rufo, a court of equity's flexible\nauthority to modify a consent decree on account of changed circumstances includes\nthe authority to relieve the moving party of a consensual commitment that was\nessential to the original decree.\" Id. As a result, the district court may \"order a\nchanged-circumstances modification that effectively terminates the decree.\" Id.\n\n       Here, the district court approved closure of Wilmot and modification of the GT\nprogram as the proper modification of the Consent Order due to the significant\nchanged circumstances. We conclude that such modification is suitably tailored. The\nConsent Order began as an effort to ensure \"that the educational experience in the\n[District] occur on a desegregated basis.\" Mays, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4528935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6.
