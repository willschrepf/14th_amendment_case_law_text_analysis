Lent (1975) 15 Cal.3d 481 (Lent),\ninfringes on privacy and expression and is unconstitutionally overbroad, and poses a risk\nof illegal eavesdropping under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (Pen. Code, § 630\net seq.) ; (2) probation conditions requiring him to “be of good citizenship and good\nconduct” and “be of good behavior and perform well” at school and on the job are vague\nand overbroad ; and (3) the court erred by setting a maximum term of confinement\nbecause L.H. was not removed from parental custody.\n\n         1\n             Undesignated statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n                                                             1\n\f       At the outset we confront an issue that has recently divided our colleagues in this\nDistrict, namely whether a condition of juvenile probation requiring a delinquent minor\nto “submit to . . . a search of [his] . . . electronics including passwords, day or night at the\nrequest of a Probation Officer or peace officer” is a valid condition of probation. After\nreviewing five recently published cases, all of which found the probation condition\ninvalid as written, we agree with our colleagues that the condition cannot stand as\nimposed. We conclude that the probation condition here is invalid under the first and\nsecond prongs of Lent, supra, 15 Cal.3d 48. We do not deem it necessary to proceed to\nthe third prong of Lent or to address the question of overbreadth. All of the cases we\nshall discuss have invalidated an identical search clause on one or the other of those\ngrounds. At least on this record, the condition is not justified as imposed and must be\nnarrowed if any type of electronic search condition is to be imposed. We therefore\nremand for further development of the record and a narrowing modification, if the court\nchooses to reimpose an electronic search condition.\n       Turning to the remaining issues, we find the claim under the California Invasion of\nPrivacy Act was forfeited by failure to raise it in the court below. We hold the language\n“be of good citizenship and good conduct” and “be of good behavior and perform well”\non the job is unconstitutionally vague and must be stricken. We find clerical error in the\ninclusion of a maximum term of confinement in the jurisdiction/disposition minute order\nand conclude that sentence must be stricken from the February 9, 2015 minute order. In\nall other respects we affirm the disposition order.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On May 6, 2014, L.H., then age 15, was observed by a police officer as he\napproached a residential address in Alameda, retrieved a package from the front porch\nthat had been delivered by United Parcel Service, and ran away with the package. Upon\nbeing detained by the officer, L.H. admitted he had taken the package. The officer\nsearched the minor’s backpack and found a bottle of vodka with a Safeway security tab\nstill affixed. L.H. admitted he had taken the bottle from Safeway. Both the package and\nthe bottle of vodka were returned to their owners.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       On July 9, 2014, the district attorney filed a section 602 petition alleging that L.H.\ncommitted two misdemeanors of concealing stolen property (Pen. Code, § 496) and petty\ntheft (Pen. Code, § 484). The juvenile court was initially hesitant to grant L.H. informal\nprobation due to his poor grades. Although he had been disciplined at school on occasion\nfor being under the influence of marijuana, he was not perceived to have a “large\nproblem” with marijuana. On October 14, 2014, in part because he had made a\n“significant improvement in his academics,” the court placed L.H. on informal probation\nunder section 654.2 without making a wardship finding. By December 15, 2014,\nhowever, the court noted there were again some “grade problems.” The judge again\nadmonished L.H., “I’m going to require all passing classes before I grant 654.2.” On\nJanuary 22, 2015, the juvenile court set aside informal probation in response to a progress\nreport showing that L.H. had violated curfew and recently used marijuana.\n       On February 9, 2015, the court denied the minor’s motion for reinstatement of\ninformal probation. L.H. admitted the petty theft allegation in exchange for a negotiated\ndismissal of the receiving count “with facts and restitution open.” Before the court\naccepted the minor’s admission, his own counsel advised him that the “maximum\npossible consequence for this admission is up to six months in a locked facility.” In\naccordance with the negotiated disposition, the district attorney dismissed count one. The\ncourt then adjudged L.H. a ward of the court under section 602. L.H. waived time and\nreferral for a social study, preferring to be placed on formal probation the same day. The\ncourt ordered L.H.’s care, custody, control, and conduct to be under the supervision of\nthe probation officer and placed him in his mother’s home with numerous conditions of\nprobation.\n       Among the probation conditions was the following: “You must submit to . . . a\nsearch of your person, any containers you may have or own, your vehicle, residence,\nelectronics including passwords, day or night at the request of a Probation Officer or\npeace officer.” Counsel for L.H. objected in court and in a written memorandum to the\nsearch condition insofar as it included “electronics including passwords” on grounds it\ndid not have “anything to do with the events here, nothing in the reports the Court has\n\n\n                                              3\n\freceived including informal probation in [the minor]’s case.” Trial counsel cited Lent,\nsupra, 15 Cal.3d 481, but did not argue the condition was unconstitutionally overbroad,\nas does counsel on appeal.\n       Responding to the objection, the court made clear its reason for imposing the\ncondition applied to all minors with drug issues: “With regards to the Search Clause, it’s\nvery clear that minors use the Internet to obtain drugs, and they also use the Internet to\nbrag and post photos and statements about themselves using drugs and possession of drug\nparaphernalia. It’s the only way we can properly monitor our minors with drug issues.”\nThe court therefore refused to remove the challenged language from the search condition.\nThis timely appeal followed.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n I.    The Electronic Search Condition\n       L.H. challenges the electronic search clause on three grounds: (1) it is not related\nto his past or future criminality and therefore violates the rule of Lent, supra, 15 Cal.3d at\npage 486, (2) it infringes on constitutional rights of privacy and expression and is\nunconstitutionally overbroad, and (3) it poses a risk of illegal eavesdropping under the\nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act (Pen. Code, § 630 et seq.).2\n       A.     The State of the Law in this District with Respect to the Electronic Search\n              Condition\n       This district has recently been called upon to resolve a number of appeals raising\nthe same issue raised by L.H.. Five published opinions in the last few months have\nconsidered an identical or nearly identical electronic search condition:3 In re Mark C.\n\n       2\n        The issue under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (Pen. Code, § 630, et\nseq.) was forfeited by failure to object on that basis in the trial court. Defense counsel\nmade no objection during the proceedings on that basis, and his written opposition to the\nmotion also omitted reference to the Act. (In re Alejandro R. (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th\n556, 563 (Alejandro R.).)\n       3\n        Two more cases were published but rendered unciteable when review was\ngranted: In re Ricardo P.(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 676, review granted February 17, 2016,\nS230923, and In re Patrick F. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 104, review granted and briefing\ndeferred February 17, 2016, S231428. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1105(e)(1).) The\n\n                                              4\n\f(2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 520 (Mark C.) [Division Two]; Alejandro R., supra, 243\nCal.App.4th 556 (Alejandro R.) (pet. rev. filed Feb. 2, 2016 in S232240) [Division One];\nIn re J.B. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 749 (J.B.) [Division Three]; In re Malik J. (2015) 240\nCal.App.4th 896 (Malik J.) [Division Three]; and In re Erica R. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th\n907 (Erica R.) [Division Two].4 All five cases have concluded that similar conditions\nwere invalid as imposed, although they followed different routes to that conclusion,\nresulting in different dispositions: three have stricken the condition without modification\n(Erica R., J.B. and Mark C.), and two have modified it in an effort to narrow its scope,\nthough not both in the same way (Malik J. and Alejandro R.).\n       The cases, considered together, address the validity of the electronic search\ncondition both under the Lent test, and under the constitutional overbreadth doctrine. We\naddress first their resolution of the issue on the first basis.\n       1.      Validity of the electronic search condition under the Lent test\n       Juvenile courts have broad discretion in establishing conditions of probation.\n“The court may impose ‘any . . . reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and\nproper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the\nward enhanced.’ ” (In re Antonio R. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 937, 940, citing § 730, subd.\n(b).) A juvenile probation condition may be more intrusive or more onerous than an adult\ncondition precisely because juveniles are more in need of guidance and supervision than\n\nSupreme Court’s order in Patrick F. described the issue in Ricardo P. as follows: “Did\nthe trial court err imposing an ‘electronics search condition’ on minor as a condition of\nhis probation when it had no relationship to the crimes he committed but was justified on\nappeal as reasonably related to future criminality under People v. Olguin (2008) 45\nCal.4th 375 because it would facilitate his supervision?”\n       4\n        In Erica R., J.B., Alejandro R., and Mark C. the electronic search conditions of\nprobation were also imposed by the same judge who imposed the condition on L.H., and\nhis explanation for its necessity was similar in each of the cases: minors frequently use\nsocial media to “brag about their marijuana usage or drug usage, particularly their\nmarijuana usage, by posting on the Internet, showing pictures of themselves with\nparaphernalia, or smoking marijuana.” (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 910; see\nMark C., supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at pp. 520, 529; Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 556, 561; J.B., supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at pp. 749, 753.)\n\n\n                                                5\n\fadults and their constitutional rights are more circumscribed than the rights of adults.\n(Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 566; accord, In re Victor L. (2010) 182\nCal.App.4th 902, 910 (Victor L.).) The youthful offender is presumed to be more\nmalleable and amenable to the development of better habits, so that the state is sometimes\nauthorized to impose relatively onerous conditions on minors. (Compare In re Luis F.\n(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 176, 189-192 (Luis F.) [upholding condition requiring minor to\ntake psychotropic medication] with People v. Petty (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1416-\n1421 [same division struck similar condition imposed on adult].) “Although the goal of\nboth types of probation is the rehabilitation of the offender, ‘[j]uvenile probation is not,\nas with an adult, an act of leniency in lieu of statutory punishment; it is an ingredient of a\nfinal order for the minor’s reformation and rehabilitation.’ ” (In re Tyrell J. (1994) 8\nCal.4th 68, 81, overruled on other grounds in In re Jaime P. (2006) 40 Cal.4th 128, 130.)\n“ ‘In light of this difference, a condition of probation that would be unconstitutional or\notherwise improper for an adult probationer may be permissible for a minor under the\nsupervision of the juvenile court.’ ” (In re Sheena K. (2007) 40 Cal.4th 875, 889 (Sheena\nK.); see, e.g., Luis F., supra, at p. 189; In re Antonio R., supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 941.)\nThis rule derives from the court’s role as parens patriae. (In re Frank V. (1991) 233\nCal.App.3d 1232, 1242–1243.) When the juvenile court exercises jurisdiction over a\nminor, it “ ‘ “stands in the shoes” ’ ” of the parents, thereby occupying a “ ‘ “unique role\n. . . in caring for the minor’s well-being” ’ ” (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 912,\nquoting Victor L., supra, at pp. 909–910), subject to our review of any probation\nconditions imposed for abuse of discretion. (In re P.A. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 23, 33.)\n       The juvenile court’s discretion is not unlimited, however. The Supreme Court in\nLent set forth three criteria for assessing the validity of a condition of probation: “A\ncondition of probation will not be held invalid unless it ‘(1) has no relationship to the\ncrime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself\ncriminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future\ncriminality . . . .’ ” (Lent, supra, 15 Cal.3d at p. 486.) The Lent test applies as well to\nconditions of juvenile probation. (In re D.G. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 47, 52–53.) The\n\n\n                                              6\n\ftest is framed in the conjunctive, so all three criteria must be satisfied before a condition\nof probation will be deemed unreasonable under Lent. (People v. Olguin (2008) 45\nCal.4th 375, 379 (Olguin).) Accordingly, a condition of probation that forbids or requires\nconduct which is not itself criminal is valid only if that conduct is reasonably related\neither to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality. (Lent,\nsupra, 15 Cal.3d at p. 486; In re Babak S. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1077, 1084.)\n       In Erica R., the first of the cases to be published, the minor had been adjudged a\nward of the court after she was found by a school counselor in possession of 30 to 45\norange pills that tested positive for amphetamine. (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at\np. 910.) Although the counselor believed Erica was selling drugs on campus, an\namended wardship petition alleged, and Erica R. admitted, only misdemeanor possession\nof Ecstasy. (Ibid.) Erica R. found “no relationship” between the electronic search\ncondition and the minor’s misdemeanor possession of Ecstasy and therefore held it failed\nthe first prong of the Lent test. There was nothing in the record “connect[ing] Erica’s use\nof electronic devices or social media to her possession of any illegal substance.” (Id. at\np. 912.) The People argued that “Erica’s cell phone and electronic devices ‘could have\nbeen used to negotiate the sales of the illegal substance,’ ” but the court reasoned that\nErica had admitted only possession, not sale, of Ecstasy, and there was no evidence that\nErica “ever used an electronic device in this way.” (Id. at pp. 912–913.) Because\npossession and use of electronic devices is not itself illegal, the electronic search\ncondition also failed the second Lent criterion. (Id. at p. 913.)\n       With respect to the third prong, Erica R. acknowledged the juvenile court had\njustified the electronic search condition based on “its experience that ‘many juveniles,\nmany minors, who are involved in drugs tend to post information [on the Internet] about\nthemselves and drug usage.’ ” (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 913.) But our\ncolleagues in Division Two found no meaningful link between the probation condition\nand the minor’s future criminality and thus found the condition did not meet the third\nLent criterion either. Erica R. reasoned “ ‘[n]ot every probation condition bearing a\nremote, attenuated, tangential, or diaphanous connection to future criminal conduct can\n\n\n                                              7\n\fbe considered reasonable.’ ” (Ibid.) Because there was “nothing in this record regarding\neither the current offense or Erica’s social history that connects her use of electronic\ndevices or social media to illegal drugs,” the link to future criminality was too tenuous to\nuphold the probation condition. (Ibid.) “In fact, the record is wholly silent about Erica’s\nusage of electronic devices or social media” (id. at p. 913) and Erica’s counsel argued\nthat she did not even own a cell phone (id. at p. 910). Erica R. struck the probation\ncondition. (Id. at p. 915.) Because it resolved the issue on Lent grounds, Erica R. did not\naddress the constitutionality of the condition. (Id. at p. 911.)\n       In Malik J., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th 896, on the other hand, Division Three found\nthere was a reasonable connection between an electronic search condition and the minor’s\nspecific crime under the first prong of Lent. (Id. at pp. 901–902, 904.) Malik had been\non juvenile probation for robbery and violated his probation by robbing in one night, with\none or two companions, three different women near a BART station. (Id. at p. 899.) The\nsearch condition was similar to the one imposed on L.H. (Id. at p. 900.) The People\njustified the probation condition based on “Malik’s history of robbing people of their cell\nphones and his claim that he does not himself own a cell phone.” (Id. at p. 902.) They\nargued the probation condition would allow a probation or police officer to check the\nphone to determine whether it had been stolen. (Ibid.) The court recognized “Malik\nmight use cell phones to coordinate with other offenders, and . . . he had previously\nrobbed people of their iPhones.” (Id. at p. 905.) For that reason, our colleagues in\nDivision Three found the condition did not violate Lent because it was valid under the\nfirst prong. (Ibid.; accord, People v. Ebertowski (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1173,\n1176–1177 [adult electronic search condition valid under first prong of Lent].)\n       The third prong of Lent―the relationship between the electronic search condition\nand the minor’s future criminality―is the one that presents a closer and more difficult\nissue, which was addressed in the next case chronologically, J.B., supra, 242 Cal.App.4th\n749. J.B. involved facts very similar to our case in that J.B. was declared a ward under\nsection 602 after he was caught stealing a shirt from a Sears store and was subjected to an\nelectronic search condition of probation. (Id. at p. 752.) As in this case, the offense\n\n\n                                              8\n\fleading to J.B.’s wardship did not involve drugs or electronic devices, but J.B. did admit\nhaving used marijuana for two and a half years, he had poor grades, and he had been\n“ ‘playing with his cell phone’ ” during an interview with his probation officer. (Id. at p.\n753.) Our colleagues in Division Three, applying the third prong of Lent for the first\ntime, aligned with Erica R. and concluded the electronic search condition was invalid\nunder Lent, disagreeing with any analysis finding a reasonable relationship to future\ncriminality. (Id. at pp. 755–759.) As we read the opinion, J.B. did not deny there was\nsome rational relationship between the electronic search condition and the prevention or\ndetection of future criminal activity, but it emphasized that the relationship must also be\nreasonable. (Id. at p. 757.) J.B. gauged the reasonableness of the relationship of the\ncondition to future criminality through the lens of the juvenile’s past criminality. (Id. at\npp. 756–757.) It asked, in essence, not simply whether the condition itself would be\nreasonably efficacious in preventing future criminality, but whether it could be seen as a\nreasonable means for deterring future crime by this particular minor based on the nature\nof his past crime. (Id. at p. 757.)\n        Division One, however, has recently parted company with Erica R. and J.B. at\nthe third stage of the Lent analysis. In Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th 556, it\ndisagreed with their analysis and found the third prong of Lent satisfied where the\njuvenile admitted a misdemeanor charge of being an accessory after the fact to the\ntransportation and distribution of marijuana, a drug-related crime more serious than that\ncommitted by L.H.. (Id. at pp. 560, 567.) Alejandro “was found to be in possession of\nillegal drugs and a member of a drug sales operation.” (Id. at p. 567.) The condition\nfailed the first prong of Lent because “there was no evidence [Alejandro] used electronic\ndevices or social media in the commission of the crime.” (Id. at p. 564; see id. at p. 567.)\n       But moving to the third prong, Alejandro R. took issue with Erica R., and\nespecially with J.B., insofar as they concluded the electronic search condition was not\nreasonably related to the minor’s future criminality. (Alejandro R., supra, 243\nCal.App.4th at pp. 564–567.) Alejandro R. held instead the condition was related to\nfuture criminality because Alejandro might, as the trial court feared, use his phone in\n\n\n                                              9\n\fconnection with marijuana distribution. (Id. at p. 567.) Moreover, the condition would\nassist the probation officer in monitoring Alejandro’s compliance with the conditions of\nhis probation. The electronic search condition was valid under Lent as a means by which\nlaw enforcement could check the minor’s Internet postings to see if he was “boasting”\nabout drug activity or was otherwise involved with drugs. (Id. at p. 568.) Alejandro R.\ntherefore held the electronic search condition met the third requirement of Lent in that it\nwas reasonably related to the minor’s future criminality. (Id. at pp. 564–567.)\n       In so holding, Alejandro R. relied chiefly on Olguin, supra, a case involving an\nadult probation condition requiring the probationer to “notify his probation officer of the\npresence of any pets at [his] place of residence.” (Olguin, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 378.)\nIn that case, our Supreme Court held a probation condition “that enables a probation\nofficer to supervise his or her charges effectively is . . . ‘reasonably related to future\ncriminality’ ” and thus passes the Lent test “even if [the] condition . . . has no relationship\nto the crime of which a defendant was convicted . . . .” (45 Cal.4th at pp. 380–381.)\nAccording to Alejandro R., the electronic search condition passes the third prong of the\nLent test because it is “ ‘reasonably related to enabling the effective supervision of [the\nappellant’s] compliance with his other probation conditions,’ ” thus bringing it within the\nambit of Olguin, supra, 45 Cal.4th 375. (Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 564;\nsee id. at p. 560.) In Olguin, although this condition bore no reasonable relationship to\nthe defendant’s past crime (driving under the influence of alcohol), and although it\napplied to all pets “from puppies to guppies,” the Supreme Court concluded it was valid\nunder Lent because it protected the safety of the probation officer charged with\n“supervising [the] probationer’s compliance with specific conditions of probation,” which\nrequired “the ability to make unscheduled visits and to conduct unannounced searches of\nthe probationer’s residence” to “deter[] future criminality.” (Id. at pp. 380–381, 383.)\nBy Alejandro R.’s reckoning, Olguin holds it is enough that a condition of probation be\nreasonably related to monitoring the probationer for future violations, even if the\ndefendant’s crime of conviction was unrelated to the condition imposed. (45 Cal.4th at\npp. 378, 380; Alejandro R., at pp. 564–565.) Alejandro R. emphasized the expansive\n\n\n                                              10\n\fscope of juvenile courts’ supervisory authority over minor probationers and found the\nLent test satisfied without much difficulty. (Id. at pp. 566–567.)\n       Finally, coming full circle, the most recent published case was Mark C., supra,\n244 Cal.App.4th 520, which was authored by the same justice who wrote Erica R. and\nreached the same result. Fundamentally, Mark C., like J.B., supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at\npages 757–758, disagreed that Olguin should govern the validity of a probation condition\nfor a juvenile offender where important privacy interests are infringed by the probation\ncondition. “We do not read Olguin to hold that every condition that might enable a\nprobation officer to supervise his or her minor charges more effectively is necessarily\n‘reasonably related to future criminality.’ (Olguin, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 381.) Such a\nreading would effectively eliminate the reasonableness requirement that the court in\nOlguin discusses at some length. (Id. at p. 382.) Requiring Mark to copy his probation\nofficer on all his e-mails, and forward all his postings on social media to his probation\nofficer might also facilitate his probation officer’s supervision of him, as would requiring\nhim to wear a body camera. But Olguin no more justifies these hypothetical probation\nconditions than the actual electronics search condition in this case.” (Mark C., supra, at\np. 533.) Thus, emphasizing that the supervisorial authority juvenile courts have over\nminor probationers, though broad, is not unlimited, Mark C., J.B. and Erica R. gave close\nscrutiny to electronic search conditions under the third prong of Lent, and struck these\nconditions outright where only tenuously justified by concerns about future criminality.5\n(Mark C., supra, at pp. 532-535; J.B., supra, at pp. 755-759; Erica R., supra, 240\nCal.App.4th at pp. 912-915.) As noted, the applicability of Olguin in the present context\nis now pending before the Supreme Court. (See fn. 3, ante.)\n\n       5\n         In so doing, Mark C. emphasized that juvenile probationers, unlike adult\nprobationers, do not have the right to refuse conditions of probation, rather such\nconditions are imposed as an ingredient of a final dispositional order. (Mark C., supra, at\npp. 530, 534.) Mark C. emphasized that juvenile conditions of probation are permissible\nonly if “ ‘ “ ‘ “tailored specifically to meet the needs of the juvenile” ’ ” ’ ” and\nconcluded, “This restriction has particular application to search conditions imposed on\njuveniles.” (Id. at p. 530.)\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       2.     Validity of the electronic search condition under the overbreadth doctrine\n       As explained above, Malik J. was the first case from this district to uphold the\nsearch condition under the Lent test. Division Three then proceeded to an analysis of the\nconstitutional overbreadth doctrine and concluded, in light of its intrusive nature, the\ncondition was overbroad and required narrowing. (Malik J., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 902–904.) “Under the overbreadth doctrine, ‘conditions of probation that impinge on\nconstitutional rights must be tailored carefully and reasonably related to the compelling\nstate interest in reformation and rehabilitation.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 902; see, e.g.,\nVictor L., supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 910.) Malik J. found a “mismatch” in such\ntailoring “because the threat of unfettered searches of Malik’s electronic communications\nsignificantly encroaches on his and potentially third parties’ constitutional rights of\nprivacy and free speech. ‘Modern cell phones are not just another technological\nconvenience. With all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many\nAmericans “the privacies of life,” [citation]. The fact that technology now allows an\nindividual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less\nworthy of the protection for which the Founders fought.’ ” (Malik J., supra, 240\nCal.App.4th at p. 902, quoting Riley v. California (2014) 573 U.S. ___, 134 S.Ct. 2473,\n2494–2495.)\n       In view of these significant privacy implications, Malik J. held the electronic\nsearch condition had to be “modified to omit the requirement that Malik turn over\npasswords to social media sites and to restrict searches to those electronic devices found\nin his custody and control.” (Malik J., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 902.) But in a twist\nnot appearing in the other cases, Malik J. focused on whether the content legitimately\naccessible to law enforcement was stored on a given device itself, or whether it was\nstored remotely, reasoning that “[i]nformation stored in a remote location cannot be\nconsidered in the probationer’s possession nor entirely within his or her control.” (Id. at\np. 903.) Since the probation condition required disclosure of passwords only to\n“electronic devices” “within [the minor’s] control,” Division Three construed the\nelectronic search condition as self-limiting to data stored on the device, and restricted the\n\n\n                                               12\n\fgovernment’s access to data stored remotely. (Id. at pp. 900, 903-904.) Because\n“identifying whether an electronic device is stolen has no relationship to accessing the\ncontent of [the minor’s] social media accounts” (id. at p. 902), Malik J. modified the\ncondition of probation to allow a search of such electronic devices, so long as they were\nnot attached to the Internet or a cellular connection (id. at pp. 903, 906).6\n       Similarly, Alejandro R. concluded the electronic search condition passed the Lent\ntest and, like Malik J., proceeded to analyze the overbreadth issue. Like Malik J., it also\nfound the electronic search condition to be unconstitutionally overbroad and held it\nrequired narrowing if it was to survive at all. In both cases, privacy concerns tended to\nfigure more prominently at the overbreadth stage of the analysis than they did in the Lent\nstage. (See Alejandro R., supra, at p. 567 [“the applications and Web sites available\nthrough electronic devices contain information ‘ “about all aspects of a person’s life,”\nincluding financial, medical, romantic, and political’ ”]; Malik J., supra, at p. 902\n[“unfettered searches of [a minor’s] electronic communications significantly encroaches\non his and potentially third parties’ constitutional rights of privacy and free speech”].)\n“Because the probation condition as drawn ‘permits review of all sorts of private\ninformation that is highly unlikely to shed any light on whether [the appellant] is\ncomplying with the other conditions of his probation, drug-related or otherwise,’ ”\nAlejandro R. held the condition was overbroad. (Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 567–568.) Accordingly, the court undertook to narrow the condition to bring it\nwithin constitutional bounds. (Id. at p. 568.)\n       But unlike Malik J., Alejandro R. did not modify the electronic search condition to\nensure the searched devices were disconnected from the Internet. Rather, Alejandro R.\nnarrowed it to “media of communication reasonably likely to reveal whether appellant is\n\n       6\n         Division Three narrowed the electronic search condition by allowing probation\nand police officers to access only “electronic devices in Malik’s custody and control\n[and] only after the device has been disabled from any internet or cellular connection and\nwithout utilizing specialized equipment designed to retrieve deleted information that is\nnot readily accessible to users of the device.” (Malik J., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at\np. 906.)\n\n\n                                              13\n\fboasting about drug use or otherwise involved with drugs . . . .” (Alejandro R., supra,\n243 Cal.App.4th at p. 568.) Thus, Division One thought the narrowing of the electronic\nsearch condition should be done on the basis of where likely drug evidence or evidence\nof forbidden associations might be found, rather than where the data was stored.7\n       B.     We Will Vacate the Electronic Search Probation Condition Imposed On\n              L.H. And Remand for Further Development of the Record\n\n       In terms of the seriousness of the minor’s misconduct, our case is more like Erica\nR. and J.B. than Malik J. and Alejandro R. The record in our case contains nothing\nindicating a connection between L.H.’s use of marijuana and any electronic device. He\ndid have two disciplinary incidents at school related to his use of marijuana, he also\ntested positive for marijuana in January 2015, and was found in possession of marijuana\non one occasion , but there is no indication he was involved in drug sales.8 There was\nalso no evidence that L.H. used a cell phone, social media, or the Internet to buy or sell\ndrugs. Thus, there was even less reason to impose the condition on this minor than there\nwas in Erica R. The condition was not reasonably related to L.H.’s past criminal\nconduct, which amounted to nothing more than petty theft. In light of its close similarity\nto J.B., we follow that case in finding the probation condition fails the first prong of the\nLent test. Of course, the probation condition also fails the second prong because\n\n\n\n       7\n         Accordingly, Alejandro R. modified the condition to read as follows: the minor\nmust “[s]ubmit [his] person and any vehicle, room, or property under [his] control to a\nsearch by the probation officer or a peace officer, with or without a search warrant, at any\ntime of the day or night. Submit all electronic devices under [his] control to a search of\nany medium of communication reasonably likely to reveal whether [he is] boasting about\n[his] drug use or otherwise involved with drugs, with or without a search warrant, at any\ntime of the day or night, and provide the probation or peace officer with any passwords\nnecessary to access the information specified. Such media of communication include text\nmessages, voicemail messages, photographs, e-mail accounts, and social media\naccounts.” (Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at pp. 569–570.)\n       8\n        When L.H. was initially arrested, his companion was in possession of\nconcentrated cannabis, but there is no indication L.H. possessed any drugs. It was\nreported, however, that L.H. was under the influence of marijuana when he was arrested.\n\n\n                                             14\n\fpossession and use of electronic devices is not illegal. (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 913.)\n       Having found the probation condition fails to pass the first and second prongs of\nLent, we proceed no further with the analysis. All five of the cases we have discussed\nconcluded that the condition cannot stand as articulated by the juvenile court. Two\nadditional cases on this issue are now pending before the Supreme Court (see fn. 3, ante),\nAlejandro R. is pending on a petition for review (S232240), and the time has not yet\nexpired for the filing of a petition for review in Mark C. Given the present unsettled state\nof the law, we assume without deciding that the condition as written is invalid under\neither the third prong of the Lent test or under the overbreadth doctrine, and will therefore\nvacate the condition at issue here, subject to reinstatement upon remand following\nadditional factual development of the record.\n       We share some of the concerns about privacy that many of our colleagues have\nexpressed in the context of both Lent prong three and the Sheena K. issue of narrowing.\nContent available on a probationer’s electronic device or social media Web site may\ninclude intimate messages and photos, posts from other Web sites which may disclose the\nprobationer’s or the third party’s political and religious affiliations, memberships in clubs\nor organizations, and other sensitive personal information having nothing to do with drug\nuse or forbidden associations. Once a minor has been forced to divulge his or her\npasswords to a probation or police officer, the intrusion upon the minor’s privacy rights\ncan be massive, though much of the information revealed would undoubtedly be\nunrelated to legitimate monitoring by the probation department. Data stored on\nelectronic devices or in social media sites that may reflect criminal behavior or forbidden\nassociations may be so intermingled with other entirely unrelated private information that\nit is not technologically possible to segregate out the protected information from that\nlegitimately open to view by government authorities. But we also recognize that these\nprivacy concerns must be balanced against a strong countervailing state interest in\neffective juvenile probation supervision. That state interest is two-fold. First, juvenile\nprobation serves to protect the public by monitoring wards for future criminality.\n\n\n                                             15\n\fSecond, juvenile wardships are designed to provide maximum opportunity for minors to\nturn their lives around, while satisfying the vital need to give the probation department\nthe tools it needs to help maximize this rehabilitative goal. (In re Jose C. (2009) 45\nCal.4th 534, 555 [“The purposes of juvenile wardship proceedings are twofold: to treat\nand rehabilitate the delinquent minor, and to protect the public from criminal conduct.\n[Citations.] The preservation of the safety and welfare of a state’s citizenry is foremost\namong its government’s interests, and it is squarely within the police power to seek to\nrehabilitate those who have committed misdeeds while protecting the populace from\nfurther misconduct.”].)\n       To further these goals, “‘the juvenile court has statutory authority to order\ndelinquent wards to receive ‘care, treatment, and guidance that is consistent with their\nbest interest, that holds them accountable for their behavior, and that is appropriate for\ntheir circumstances.’ ” (In re Charles G. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.) “All\ndispositional orders in a wardship case must take into account the best interests of the\nchild and the rehabilitative purposes of the juvenile court law. [Citation.]” (In re S.S.\n(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 543, 550.) The basis for imposing an electronic search condition\nin service of the objectives of juvenile probation will sometimes be manifestly plain,\ngiven the nature of the ward’s criminal record (e.g., a history of violent conduct) or the\nward’s particular rehabilitative needs (e.g., a history of mental illness posing risks to\nothers). For some wards, in short, there may be no meaningful alternative to having what\namounts to an electronic window into every corner of their lives, at all times. But in the\nabsence of public safety or officer safety concerns, these conditions ought not to be\nimposed routinely.\n       The record before us is thin. All we know is that L.H. stole a UPS package off of\nsomeone’s porch, shoplifted a bottle of vodka from a store, and had been disciplined at\nschool for marijuana use and possession. We have no basis to assess the seriousness of\nthe risk of future criminality by L.H., and there is nothing in the record but the broadest\nof generalities to explain why forced turnover of account passwords, in particular, is\nrequired for L.H.’s rehabilitative needs. As a precautionary measure to guard against any\n\n\n                                              16\n\fworsening of the minor’s involvement with drugs, it was of course fully within the\ncourt’s discretion to put in place an additional, more intensive form of drug monitoring,\nbut the reasons for employing an electronic search condition to accomplish that—\ncompared to, say, increased frequency of drug testing—are vague and have no specific\nconnection to the facts of this case. The juvenile court indicated that “minors use the\nInternet to obtain drugs, and they also use the Internet to brag and post photos and\nstatements about themselves using drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia,” but the\nrecord is bereft of anything to indicate why this particular minor might do any of those\nthings or why monitoring his behavior on the Internet is “only way” to detect his drug-\nrelated activity.\n       Equally important, the record here not only contains few details about why an\nelectronic search condition is justified, it is also silent with respect to what kind of\nelectronic devices the minor uses, if in fact he uses any such devices at all,9 and if so,\nwhat apps he uses, and how those devices and applications are used by L.H.\n       Although our colleagues in two of the cases we have discussed have sustained\nsuch conditions under Lent and gone on to resolve overbreadth problems by imposing\nmodifications on appeal (see Sheena K., supra, 40 Cal.4th at pp. 889–892), we believe it\nis inappropriate to take either route here, at least as the record now stands. Before any\ndecision is made on Lent prong three and, if required, on Sheena K. narrowing,\ndevelopment of a more robust factual record is necessary, starting with some specifics\naround the justification for imposing an electronic search condition in the first place. To\ndecide either of these issues on the present record would require that we engage in much\nspeculation about the facts bearing on future criminality, and, if it is necessary to go\nfurther and consider narrowing, about how the scope of permitted electronic search might\nbest be fitted to the minor’s particular electronic communication usage habits. As a\npractical matter, these issues are bound up with one another. Because any saving\n\n\n       9\n        For a juvenile from an economically disadvantaged background, the answer to\nthat question could well be that he does not use any because he cannot afford them.\n\n\n                                              17\n\fmodifications should closely track the specific circumstances justifying imposition of the\nelectronic search condition, thus limiting the scope of permitted search to its justifying\nrationale as far as possible, the juvenile court—working with minor’s counsel, and with\nthe probation department—is best-positioned to assess how any such modifications\nshould be formulated. We will therefore strike the electronic search condition imposed\non L.H., as it is currently framed, and leave to the juvenile court whether the condition\nshould be reinstated, with whatever reasonable narrowing modifications it may wish to\nadopt after further development of the record.\nII.    Probation Conditions Requiring “Good Citizenship,” “Good Conduct,”\n       “Good Behavior,” and Requiring the Minor to “Perform Well” at School and\n       at Work\n       L.H. next challenges the conditions of probation insofar as they require him to “be\nof good conduct” or “good citizenship and good conduct,” and as part of a condition\nrequiring him to attend school and his job on time and regularly, that he “be of good\nbehavior and perform well.” He claims the quoted terms are unconstitutionally vague\nand fail to ensure that the minor himself will be able to ascertain what is required of him\nand conform his behavior accordingly, and also fail to provide an explicit standard for\nthose monitoring his compliance, thereby opening the door to subjective enforcement and\nthe “ ‘ “dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.” ’ ” (Sheena K., supra, 40\nCal.4th at p. 890; see Grayned v. City of Rockford (1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108–109.) He\nalso claims the conditions are overbroad. Because we conclude the terms are in some\nrespects unconstitutionally vague, we do not address his overbreadth argument.\n       A.     Forfeiture\n       The People respond that L.H. forfeited this issue by failing to object below and\nthat the juvenile court explained to L.H. what the challenged language in the conditions\nof probation required. An objection to a condition of probation in the trial court is\nordinarily required to preserve that issue for review. Accordingly, People v. Gardineer\n(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 148, 151–152, refused to address a challenge to an “observe good\nconduct” condition of probation, finding it waived by failure to object.\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       L.H. argues we should reach the merits of his contentions regardless because,\nalthough conduct-related explanations were provided orally to him by the juvenile court,\nhe raises now a challenge to the oral and written conditions of probation which added the\nspecific offending language. The problem with L.H.’s argument with respect to the\n“good conduct” condition is that it was initially imposed orally, and defense counsel\nfailed to object. Had he objected, the court might have explained the conduct\nrequirement in more detail or might have eliminated the challenged language. L.H.\ncontends, however, that we should review the written probation conditions on their face\nunder the rule that probation conditions, unconstitutional on their face and presenting a\npure question of law, may be challenged on appeal despite the failure to object in the trial\ncourt, so long as the alleged error is “capable of correction without reference to the\nparticular sentencing record developed in the trial court.” (Sheena K., supra, 40 Cal.4th\nat pp. 887–888; accord, In re Luis F., supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 181.)\n       Given the claim of facial invalidity, we exercise our discretion to review the “be of\ngood citizenship and good conduct” probation condition, in part because we have twice\nbefore suggested to judges of the Alameda County Superior Court that they oversee the\ndeletion of the “good conduct” condition from the county’s standard forms.10 The court\nhas not heeded our suggestions. We are mindful that modifying forms of this nature\noften takes time and is far more involved than simply making a word processing change,\nbut we are compelled to reiterate our advice as a respectful reminder.\n       We also exercise our discretion to review the condition requiring L.H. to “be of\ngood behavior and perform well” in school and at work. The court did not orally impose\nthe challenged condition and the court’s minute order does not reflect the complained-of\nlanguage. It appears only in a separate written list of “Conditions of Probation and Court\nOrders.” Although the written document shows the minor signed a copy, and presumably\nreceived a copy, on the date of the jurisdiction/ disposition hearing, it appears this was\n\n\n       10\n       In re D.R. (Oct. 28, 2013, A137789) [nonpub. opn.]; In re N.B. (May 21, 2013,\nA136160) [nonpub. opn.].\n\n\n                                             19\n\fnot provided to L.H. until after the oral proceedings were concluded. It thus appears\nthere may not have been an opportunity for his attorney to object to the written\nconditions. We therefore address all of L.H.’s arguments relating to conduct and\nperformance conditions.\n       B.     The “good conduct” condition is unconstitutionally vague and must be\n              stricken\n       The challenged language of the probation order “be of good conduct” is very\nbroad and has been challenged numerous times in this District, oftentimes with success.11\nWe take judicial notice of nonpublished cases noted in footnotes 10 and 11 not to rely on\ntheir legal analysis as precedent, but to demonstrate the regularity with which the issue\nhas been litigated in our District. (Evid. Code, §§ 452, 459; cf. Cal. Rules of Court, rule\n8.1115.) We find the conjoined phrase “good citizenship” to be equally broad and ill-\ndefined.\n       A probation condition is unconstitutionally vague if it is not “ ‘ “sufficiently\nprecise for the probationer to know what is required of him, and for the court to\ndetermine whether the condition has been violated.” ’ [Citation.] A restriction failing\nthis test does not give adequate notice—‘fair warning’—of the conduct proscribed.” (In\nre E.O. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153.) In determining the adequacy of the notice\ngiven, “we are guided by the principles that ‘abstract legal commands must be applied in\na specific context,’ and that, although not admitting of ‘mathematical certainty,’ the\nlanguage used must have ‘ “reasonable specificity.” ’ ” (Sheena K., supra, 40 Cal.4th at\np. 890; see generally, In re Kevin F. (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 351, 357–358.)\n\n\n\n\n       11\n         See, e.g., In re Brandon C. (Feb. 18, 2014, A138960) [nonpub. opn., Division\nTwo; challenge successful]; In re Adrian B. (Apr. 16, 2013, A131529) [nonpub. opn.,\nDivision Two; challenge unsuccessful because condition was explained orally]; In re A.V.\n(Dec. 12, 2012, A133762) [nonpub. opn., Division Five; challenge unsuccessful because\ncondition construed as “obey all laws” condition]; In re A.T. (Feb. 21, 2012, A131996)\n[nonpub. opn., Division Three; challenge successful]; In re N.R. (Dec. 20, 2011,\nA130621) [nonpub. opn., Division Three; challenge successful].\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       With these principles in mind, we conclude that the first probation condition under\nscrutiny is impermissibly vague. The condition that L.H. “be of good citizenship and\ngood conduct” lacks specificity and fails to provide meaningful guidance to L.H. or the\ncourt in determining what conduct is prohibited, and the People have not offered any\nsuggestions as to what the condition actually requires. They have only argued that the\ncourt gave “comprehensive explanations of the culled phrases . . . challenged on appeal.”\nWhile we agree that the court explained orally what it means to “be of good behavior” at\nschool, we see nothing in the court’s admonitions clarifying what it means to “be of good\ncitizenship and good conduct” more generally.\n       Arguably, the condition serves as a catchall label for other conditions imposed,\nsuch as directives that L.H. obey all laws, obey his parents, attend school, abide by his\ncurfew, refrain from using drugs or alcohol, stay away from others who use drugs and\nalcohol, and the other conduct-related conditions recited above. But since each of the\nother conditions was spelled out individually on the “Conditions of Probation and Court\nOrders,” adding a separate non-specific catchall for already-imposed specific conditions\nis duplicative and unnecessary, and it provides no notice of additional prohibited\nbehavior. Because it is impermissibly vague and serves no legitimate purpose that we\ncan discern, the condition instructing L.H. generally to “be of good citizenship and good\nconduct” was improperly imposed.\n       C.     The “good behavior and perform well” condition must be stricken as it\n              applies to the minor’s work, but not as it applies to his school participation\n       The “good behavior” component of the challenged school and work condition\nsuffers from the same vagueness concerns present in the “good conduct” condition.\nLikewise, the “perform well” language is imprecise and subjective. (See In re Angel J.\n(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1101 (Angel J.).) At school, this directive could encompass\nmore than just grades, such as attendance or participation. Indeed, even a probation\ncondition requiring the minor to maintain “satisfactory grades” has been held too vague\nto be enforced. (Id. at pp. 1101–1102.) The court in Angel J. held that in order to pass\nconstitutional muster, the term “satisfactory” required a more specific definition. (Id. at\n\n\n                                             21\n\fp. 1102.) Angel J. defined “satisfactory grades” as passing grades in each graded subject\n(i.e., a D or above in an A through F grading system) and modified the condition of\nprobation accordingly. (Ibid. & fn. 7.)\n       But we think the court’s detailed oral explanations in this case adequately defined\nthe terms “good behavior” and “perform well” with respect to school participation so as\nto allow the condition to pass constitutional muster. By giving detailed direction for\ngrades, attendance and more, it gave shape to the vague language contained in the written\nprobation conditions. We therefore agree with the People that the “be of good behavior\nand perform well” condition of probation was adequately explained orally by the judge\ninsofar as school participation and performance were concerned. Sheena K., supra, 40\nCal.4th at page 891, recognized that “a probation condition that otherwise would be\ndeemed vague may be constitutional because the juvenile court offered additional oral or\nwritten comments clarifying” its meaning. (Accord, In re Kevin F., supra, 239\nCal.App.4th at p. 358.)\n       In the present case the court did just that with respect to the challenged condition\nas it related to school behavior and performance. Specifically, the juvenile court\ninstructed L.H. that he is not to be on any campus or school grounds unless enrolled, or\naccompanied by an adult, or authorized by the school staff; and he must attend school\n“every day on time . . . every class on time, stay through the entirety of every class, do all\n. . . homework, and pass all . . . classes.” Additionally, L.H. was told he must “obey all\nschool rules and regulations,” and he is not to “leave the school campus without\npermission of school officials or the Probation Officer.” The court more than once orally\nadmonished L.H. that his “main focus” should be on “school, school, school,” leaving no\ndoubt that the court expected him to attend regularly, obey the rules, and attain passing\ngrades. This same formula for success in school had been driven home by the court from\nearly on in the proceedings because L.H. had been receiving poor grades (“all Fs and one\nD”). L.H. showed significant improvement in school after receiving that advice from the\ncourt. Thus, we infer L.H. understood what was required, and we find the condition as\nimposed in this case was not vague or overbroad with respect to the minor’s expected\n\n\n                                             22\n\fschool participation. We do not find it necessary to modify the “be of good behavior and\nperform well” clause.\n       While “be of good behavior and perform well” could be called surplusage in the\ncontext of school performance, given the court’s more specific oral explanation, having\nthat language embodied in the written conditions of probation (which apparently were\ngiven to L.H.) may serve as a reminder to him that he must not only attend school but\nalso must do his homework, achieve passing grades, and obey school rules. Accordingly,\nwe do not deem it necessary to strike the written condition, as that might signal to L.H.\nthat attendance alone is required, thereby undercutting the court’s supervisory power over\nhim. Nor do we modify the condition because its scope was defined by the oral\npronouncements. The inclusion of the umbrella phrases “good behavior” and “perform\nwell” does not offend the constitution. With respect to the “good citizenship and good\nconduct” condition, which relates to the minor’s overall behavior and as to which no oral\nguidelines were provided, we opt to strike the vague language as unhelpful and\nmeaningless surplusage. The catchall language in the school attendance and performance\ncondition is different in that it bears additional meaning by triggering operation of the\norally imposed conditions, which were not otherwise prescribed in writing. Therefore we\nconclude the language need not be stricken from the probation condition insofar as school\nparticipation is concerned.\n       With respect to being of good behavior and performing well at work, on the other\nhand, the minor did not receive clarifying instruction. The court’s oral pronouncements\nprovided no guidance as to how L.H. could “perform well” at a job, which lacks the\nstructure of the grading system used to define satisfactory performance in Angel J., supra,\n9 Cal.App.4th 1096 at page 1102 and footnote 7. Therefore, as applied to work\nparticipation the probation condition remains unacceptably vague and is invalid. The\n“good behavior” component is unconstitutionally vague for the same reasons the “be of\ngood conduct” clause is unconstitutionally vague. The “perform well” component is\nvague because standards of performing well vary by work setting and by supervisor.\nL.H. was not employed at the time of the hearing, but was seeking employment, and the\n\n\n                                             23\n\fcourt’s main advice about work was not to let it interfere with school: “Work is good, and\nthat’s very important, because it’s a way of getting money, but school is the main focus.\nAnd the nice thing about these [job] programs, they’ll never put you in a work situation\nthat will in any way make it more difficult to do school. It’s supposed to be a nice\ncompliment [sic] to school. [¶] So school, school, school.” L.H. was given no standards\nby which his behavior on the job would be judged and no explanation of what was\nrequired before the court would consider him to be performing well. The language must\nbe stricken from the probation condition with respect to work participation. This may be\naccomplished simply by striking the words “or job” from the written condition.\nIII.   Maximum Term of Confinement\n       Finally, L.H. argues that the court erred in setting a maximum term of confinement\nbecause he was not removed from parental custody, and the establishment of a maximum\nterm of confinement was not only unnecessary, but unauthorized. Section 726,\nsubdivision (d)(1) provides: “(1) If the minor is removed from the physical custody of\nhis or her parent or guardian as the result of an order of wardship made pursuant to\nSection 602, the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical\nconfinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be\nimposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued\nthe minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.” Given the introductory clause,\nseveral cases have held it is improper for a court to set a maximum term of confinement\nin a case where the minor is not removed from the parental home. (In re A.C. (2014) 224\nCal.App.4th 590, 592 (A.C.); In re Matthew A. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 537, 541\n(Matthew A.); In re Ali A.(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 569, 573–574 (Ali A.).)\n       In the foregoing cases, the courts agreed that setting such a term at a disposition\nhearing is beyond the juvenile court’s statutory authority, but have disagreed whether a\nremedy is necessary. As one court noted, the erroneous inclusion of the term has “no\nlegal effect” and thus causes no prejudice. (Ali A., supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 574.)\nAccordingly, the Third District held it was not necessary to order the maximum term of\nconfinement stricken from the order. (Ibid.)\n\n\n                                             24\n\f       The courts that have provided a remedy have done so for prophylactic reasons.\nThe Second District, Division Eight, held not only that the statute did not empower\njuvenile courts to specify a maximum term if the minor was not being removed from the\nparental home, but found that “criticism of this practice in prior opinions without actually\nordering a correction of the disposition seems to have had little effect.” (Matthew A.,\nsupra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 541.) Therefore, the court ordered the statement in the\ndisposition order stricken. (Ibid.) More recently, the Third District reversed the position\nit took in Ali A. and agreed with Matthew A. as to the appropriate disposition. “[T]he\nerror of including maximum terms in noncustodial orders continues, unnecessarily\ndepleting the limited resources of the judicial system. To stop this error, and quell the\ndebate over its effect, we now conclude that where a juvenile court’s order includes a\nmaximum confinement term for a minor who is not removed from parental custody, the\nremedy is to strike the term.” (A.C., supra, 224 Cal.App.4th at p. 592.)\n       The People rely on In re P.A., supra, 211 Cal.App.4th 23, in which the Fourth\nDistrict, Division Two, held it was not error for the court to mention the maximum term\nof confinement at a jurisdictional hearing. (Id. at pp. 31–32.) Because “the juvenile\ncourt did not mention a maximum term of confinement at the disposition hearing or in its\ndispositional order,” the court found no error and no remedy was necessary. (Ibid.) We\nagree that because the court in our case mentioned the maximum term of confinement\nonly during the plea colloquy at the jurisdictional hearing, there was no judicial error. 12\n(Cf. In re M.G. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1275, fn. 4.)\n\n\n\n\n       12\n          The reporter’s transcript reflects only two mentions of the maximum term of\nconfinement, both at the jurisdictional phase of the hearing. The defense attorney, not the\njudge, first mentioned it. Asked to voir dire his client, defense counsel advised L.H.,\namong other things, “The maximum possible consequence for this admission is up to six\nmonths in a locked facility. Do you understand that?” L.H. responded, “Yes.” The\njudge thereafter asked L.H. “having all your rights in mind as well as the possible\nconfinement in a locked facility for up to six months,” whether he admitted or denied the\npetty theft allegation of the petition, and L.H. admitted it.\n\n\n                                              25\n\f       The minute order in our case, however, unlike that in In re P.A., supra, does\nreflect as one of the court’s orders: “The maximum time the child may be confined in\nsecure custody for the offenses sustained in the petition before the court is 6 months.”\nThis appears to have been a clerical error. Because the same written order served as both\na jurisdictional and dispositional order, it should not have included a maximum term of\nconfinement. Because we remand for other modifications, we will order that sentence\nstricken from the minute order under the pragmatic reasoning of A.C., supra, 224\nCal.App.4th at page 592 and Matthew A., supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at page 541.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The conditions of probation are modified as follows: (1) by striking the language\n“electronic including passwords” from the search condition of probation reflected in the\nminute order and the words “electronics and passwords” from the “Conditions of\nProbation and Court Orders” (collectively, the “Electronic Search Condition”); (2) by\nstriking the language “be of good citizenship and good conduct” from the “Conditions of\nProbation and Court Orders” each time it appears; (3) by striking the language “or job”\nfrom the condition requiring L.H. to “attend classes or job on time and regularly; be of\ngood behavior and perform well”; and (4) by striking from the minute order dated\nFebruary 9, 2015, the language: “The maximum time the child may be confined in secure\ncustody for the offenses sustained in the petition before the court is 6 months.” The case\nis remanded for fuller development of a record that would support narrowing\nmodifications to the Electronic Search Condition, should the court decide to reimpose\nsuch a condition. The Electronic Search Condition may be reinstated upon remand,\nsubject to such modifications. In all other respects the dispositional order is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f                                 _________________________\n                                 Streeter, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nRuvolo, P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nReardon, J.\n\n\n\n\nA144397/In re L.H.\n\n\n                            27\n\f",

After\nreviewing five recently published cases, all of which found the probation condition\ninvalid as written, we agree with our colleagues that the condition cannot stand as\nimposed. We conclude that the probation condition here is invalid under the first and\nsecond prongs of Lent, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. We do not deem it necessary to proceed to\nthe third prong of Lent or to address the question of overbreadth. All of the cases we\nshall discuss have invalidated an identical search clause on one or the other of those\ngrounds. At least on this record, the condition is not justified as imposed and must be\nnarrowed if any type of electronic search condition is to be imposed. We therefore\nremand for further development of the record and a narrowing modification, if the court\nchooses to reimpose an electronic search condition.\n       Turning to the remaining issues, we find the claim under the California Invasion of\nPrivacy Act was forfeited by failure to raise it in the court below. We hold the language\n“be of good citizenship and good conduct” and “be of good behavior and perform well”\non the job is unconstitutionally vague and must be stricken. We find clerical error in the\ninclusion of a maximum term of confinement in the jurisdiction/disposition minute order\nand conclude that sentence must be stricken from the February 9, 2015 minute order. In\nall other respects we affirm the disposition order.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On May 6, 2014, L.H., then age 15, was observed by a police officer as he\napproached a residential address in Alameda, retrieved a package from the front porch\nthat had been delivered by United Parcel Service, and ran away with the package. Upon\nbeing detained by the officer, L.H. admitted he had taken the package. The officer\nsearched the minor’s backpack and found a bottle of vodka with a Safeway security tab\nstill affixed. L.H. admitted he had taken the bottle from Safeway. Both the package and\nthe bottle of vodka were returned to their owners.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       On July 9, 2014, the district attorney filed a section 602 petition alleging that L.H.\ncommitted two misdemeanors of concealing stolen property (Pen. Code, § 496) and petty\ntheft (Pen. Code, § 484). The juvenile court was initially hesitant to grant L.H. informal\nprobation due to his poor grades. Although he had been disciplined at school on occasion\nfor being under the influence of marijuana, he was not perceived to have a “large\nproblem” with marijuana. On October 14, 2014, in part because he had made a\n“significant improvement in his academics,” the court placed L.H. on informal probation\nunder section 654.2 without making a wardship finding. By December 15, 2014,\nhowever, the court noted there were again some “grade problems.” The judge again\nadmonished L.H., “I’m going to require all passing classes before I grant 654.2.” On\nJanuary 22, 2015, the juvenile court set aside informal probation in response to a progress\nreport showing that L.H. had violated curfew and recently used marijuana.\n       On February 9, 2015, the court denied the minor’s motion for reinstatement of\ninformal probation. L.H. admitted the petty theft allegation in exchange for a negotiated\ndismissal of the receiving count “with facts and restitution open.” Before the court\naccepted the minor’s admission, his own counsel advised him that the “maximum\npossible consequence for this admission is up to six months in a locked facility.” In\naccordance with the negotiated disposition, the district attorney dismissed count one. The\ncourt then adjudged L.H. a ward of the court under section 602. L.H. waived time and\nreferral for a social study, preferring to be placed on formal probation the same day. The\ncourt ordered L.H.’s care, custody, control, and conduct to be under the supervision of\nthe probation officer and placed him in his mother’s home with numerous conditions of\nprobation.\n       Among the probation conditions was the following: “You must submit to . . . a\nsearch of your person, any containers you may have or own, your vehicle, residence,\nelectronics including passwords, day or night at the request of a Probation Officer or\npeace officer.” Counsel for L.H. objected in court and in a written memorandum to the\nsearch condition insofar as it included “electronics including passwords” on grounds it\ndid not have “anything to do with the events here, nothing in the reports the Court has\n\n\n                                              3\n\freceived including informal probation in [the minor]’s case.” Trial counsel cited Lent,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1162126\"><a href=\"/opinion/1162126/people-v-lent/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, but did not argue the condition was unconstitutionally overbroad,\nas does counsel on appeal.\n       Responding to the objection, the court made clear its reason for imposing the\ncondition applied to all minors with drug issues: “With regards to the Search Clause, it’s\nvery clear that minors use the Internet to obtain drugs, and they also use the Internet to\nbrag and post photos and statements about themselves using drugs and possession of drug\nparaphernalia. It’s the only way we can properly monitor our minors with drug issues.”\nThe court therefore refused to remove the challenged language from the search condition.\nThis timely appeal followed.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n I.    The Electronic Search Condition\n       L.H. challenges the electronic search clause on three grounds: (1) it is not related\nto his past or future criminality and therefore violates the rule of Lent, supra, 15 Cal.3d at\npage 486, (2) it infringes on constitutional rights of privacy and expression and is\nunconstitutionally overbroad, and (3) it poses a risk of illegal eavesdropping under the\nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act (Pen. Code, § 630 et seq.).2\n       A.     The State of the Law in this District with Respect to the Electronic Search\n              Condition\n       This district has recently been called upon to resolve a number of appeals raising\nthe same issue raised by L.H.. Five published opinions in the last few months have\nconsidered an identical or nearly identical electronic search condition:3 In re Mark C.\n\n       2\n        The issue under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (Pen. Code, § 630, et\nseq.) was forfeited by failure to object on that basis in the trial court. Defense counsel\nmade no objection during the proceedings on that basis, and his written opposition to the\nmotion also omitted reference to the Act. (In re Alejandro R.

When the juvenile court exercises jurisdiction over a\nminor, it “ ‘ “stands in the shoes” ’ ” of the parents, thereby occupying a “ ‘ “unique role\n. . . in caring for the minor’s well-being” ’ ” (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 912,\nquoting Victor L., supra, at pp. 909–910), subject to our review of any probation\nconditions imposed for abuse of discretion.

The Supreme Court in\nLent set forth three criteria for assessing the validity of a condition of probation: “A\ncondition of probation will not be held invalid unless it ‘(1) has no relationship to the\ncrime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself\ncriminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future\ncriminality . . . .’ ” (Lent, supra, 15 Cal.3d at p. 486.) The Lent test applies as well to\nconditions of juvenile probation. (In re D.G. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2288269\"><a href=\"/opinion/2288269/in-re-dg/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(People v. Olguin (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2512145\"><a href=\"/opinion/2512145/people-v-olguin/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379 (Olguin).) Accordingly, a condition of probation that forbids or requires\nconduct which is not itself criminal is valid only if that conduct is reasonably related\neither to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality. (Lent,\nsupra, 15 Cal.3d at p. 486; In re Babak S. (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084.)\n       In Erica R., the first of the cases to be published, the minor had been adjudged a\nward of the court after she was found by a school counselor in possession of 30 to 45\norange pills that tested positive for amphetamine. (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at\np. 910.) Although the counselor believed Erica was selling drugs on campus, an\namended wardship petition alleged, and Erica R. admitted, only misdemeanor possession\nof Ecstasy. (Ibid.) Erica R. found “no relationship” between the electronic search\ncondition and the minor’s misdemeanor possession of Ecstasy and therefore held it failed\nthe first prong of the Lent test. There was nothing in the record “connect[ing] Erica’s use\nof electronic devices or social media to her possession of any illegal substance.” (Id. at\np. 912.) The People argued that “Erica’s cell phone and electronic devices ‘could have\nbeen used to negotiate the sales of the illegal substance,’ ” but the court reasoned that\nErica had admitted only possession, not sale, of Ecstasy, and there was no evidence that\nErica “ever used an electronic device in this way.” (Id. at pp. 912–913.) Because\npossession and use of electronic devices is not itself illegal, the electronic search\ncondition also failed the second Lent criterion. (Id. at p. 913.)\n       With respect to the third prong, Erica R. acknowledged the juvenile court had\njustified the electronic search condition based on “its experience that ‘many juveniles,\nmany minors, who are involved in drugs tend to post information [on the Internet] about\nthemselves and drug usage.’ ” (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 913.) But our\ncolleagues in Division Two found no meaningful link between the probation condition\nand the minor’s future criminality and thus found the condition did not meet the third\nLent criterion either. Erica R. reasoned “ ‘[n]ot every probation condition bearing a\nremote, attenuated, tangential, or diaphanous connection to future criminal conduct can\n\n\n                                              7\n\fbe considered reasonable.’ ” (Ibid.) Because there was “nothing in this record regarding\neither the current offense or Erica’s social history that connects her use of electronic\ndevices or social media to illegal drugs,” the link to future criminality was too tenuous to\nuphold the probation condition. (Ibid.) “In fact, the record is wholly silent about Erica’s\nusage of electronic devices or social media” (id. at p. 913) and Erica’s counsel argued\nthat she did not even own a cell phone (id. at p. 910). Erica R. struck the probation\ncondition. (Id. at p. 915.) Because it resolved the issue on Lent grounds, Erica R. did not\naddress the constitutionality of the condition. (Id. at p. 911.)\n       In Malik J., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, on the other hand, Division Three found\nthere was a reasonable connection between an electronic search condition and the minor’s\nspecific crime under the first prong of Lent. (Id. at pp. 901–902, 904.) Malik had been\non juvenile probation for robbery and violated his probation by robbing in one night, with\none or two companions, three different women near a BART station. (Id. at p. 899.) The\nsearch condition was similar to the one imposed on L.H. (Id. at p. 900.) The People\njustified the probation condition based on “Malik’s history of robbing people of their cell\nphones and his claim that he does not himself own a cell phone.” (Id. at p. 902.) They\nargued the probation condition would allow a probation or police officer to check the\nphone to determine whether it had been stolen. (Ibid.) The court recognized “Malik\nmight use cell phones to coordinate with other offenders, and . . . he had previously\nrobbed people of their iPhones.” (Id. at p. 905.) For that reason, our colleagues in\nDivision Three found the condition did not violate Lent because it was valid under the\nfirst prong. (Ibid.; accord, People v. Ebertowski (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1173,\n1176–1177 [adult electronic search condition valid under first prong of Lent].)\n       The third prong of Lent―the relationship between the electronic search condition\nand the minor’s future criminality―is the one that presents a closer and more difficult\nissue, which was addressed in the next case chronologically, J.B., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">749</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. J.B. involved facts very similar to our case in that J.B. was declared a ward under\nsection 602 after he was caught stealing a shirt from a Sears store and was subjected to an\nelectronic search condition of probation. (Id. at p. 752.) As in this case, the offense\n\n\n                                              8\n\fleading to J.B.’s wardship did not involve drugs or electronic devices, but J.B. did admit\nhaving used marijuana for two and a half years, he had poor grades, and he had been\n“ ‘playing with his cell phone’ ” during an interview with his probation officer. (Id. at p.\n753.) Our colleagues in Division Three, applying the third prong of Lent for the first\ntime, aligned with Erica R. and concluded the electronic search condition was invalid\nunder Lent, disagreeing with any analysis finding a reasonable relationship to future\ncriminality. (Id. at pp. 755–759.) As we read the opinion, J.B. did not deny there was\nsome rational relationship between the electronic search condition and the prevention or\ndetection of future criminal activity, but it emphasized that the relationship must also be\nreasonable. (Id. at p. 757.) J.B. gauged the reasonableness of the relationship of the\ncondition to future criminality through the lens of the juvenile’s past criminality. (Id. at\npp. 756–757.) It asked, in essence, not simply whether the condition itself would be\nreasonably efficacious in preventing future criminality, but whether it could be seen as a\nreasonable means for deterring future crime by this particular minor based on the nature\nof his past crime. (Id. at p. 757.)\n        Division One, however, has recently parted company with Erica R. and J.B. at\nthe third stage of the Lent analysis. In Alejandro R., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, it\ndisagreed with their analysis and found the third prong of Lent satisfied where the\njuvenile admitted a misdemeanor charge of being an accessory after the fact to the\ntransportation and distribution of marijuana, a drug-related crime more serious than that\ncommitted by L.H.. (Id. at pp. 560, 567.) Alejandro “was found to be in possession of\nillegal drugs and a member of a drug sales operation.” (Id. at p. 567.) The condition\nfailed the first prong of Lent because “there was no evidence [Alejandro] used electronic\ndevices or social media in the commission of the crime.” (Id. at p. 564; see id. at p. 567.)\n       But moving to the third prong, Alejandro R. took issue with Erica R., and\nespecially with J.B., insofar as they concluded the electronic search condition was not\nreasonably related to the minor’s future criminality. (Alejandro R., supra, 243\nCal.App.4th at pp. 564–567.) Alejandro R. held instead the condition was related to\nfuture criminality because Alejandro might, as the trial court feared, use his phone in\n\n\n                                              9\n\fconnection with marijuana distribution. (Id. at p. 567.) Moreover, the condition would\nassist the probation officer in monitoring Alejandro’s compliance with the conditions of\nhis probation. The electronic search condition was valid under Lent as a means by which\nlaw enforcement could check the minor’s Internet postings to see if he was “boasting”\nabout drug activity or was otherwise involved with drugs. (Id. at p. 568.) Alejandro R.\ntherefore held the electronic search condition met the third requirement of Lent in that it\nwas reasonably related to the minor’s future criminality. (Id. at pp. 564–567.)\n       In so holding, Alejandro R. relied chiefly on Olguin, supra, a case involving an\nadult probation condition requiring the probationer to “notify his probation officer of the\npresence of any pets at [his] place of residence.” (Olguin, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 378.)\nIn that case, our Supreme Court held a probation condition “that enables a probation\nofficer to supervise his or her charges effectively is . . . ‘reasonably related to future\ncriminality’ ” and thus passes the Lent test “even if [the] condition . . . has no relationship\nto the crime of which a defendant was convicted . . . .” (45 Cal.4th at pp. 380–381.)\nAccording to Alejandro R., the electronic search condition passes the third prong of the\nLent test because it is “ ‘reasonably related to enabling the effective supervision of [the\nappellant’s] compliance with his other probation conditions,’ ” thus bringing it within the\nambit of Olguin, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2512145\"><a href=\"/opinion/2512145/people-v-olguin/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. (Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 564;\nsee id. at p. 560.) In Olguin, although this condition bore no reasonable relationship to\nthe defendant’s past crime (driving under the influence of alcohol), and although it\napplied to all pets “from puppies to guppies,” the Supreme Court concluded it was valid\nunder Lent because it protected the safety of the probation officer charged with\n“supervising [the] probationer’s compliance with specific conditions of probation,” which\nrequired “the ability to make unscheduled visits and to conduct unannounced searches of\nthe probationer’s residence” to “deter[] future criminality.” (Id. at pp. 380–381, 383.)\nBy Alejandro R.’s reckoning, Olguin holds it is enough that a condition of probation be\nreasonably related to monitoring the probationer for future violations, even if the\ndefendant’s crime of conviction was unrelated to the condition imposed. (45 Cal.4th at\npp. 378, 380; Alejandro R., at pp. 564–565.) Alejandro R. emphasized the expansive\n\n\n                                              10\n\fscope of juvenile courts’ supervisory authority over minor probationers and found the\nLent test satisfied without much difficulty. (Id. at pp. 566–567.)\n       Finally, coming full circle, the most recent published case was Mark C., supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which was authored by the same justice who wrote Erica R. and\nreached the same result. Fundamentally, Mark C., like J.B., supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at\npages 757–758, disagreed that Olguin should govern the validity of a probation condition\nfor a juvenile offender where important privacy interests are infringed by the probation\ncondition. “We do not read Olguin to hold that every condition that might enable a\nprobation officer to supervise his or her minor charges more effectively is necessarily\n‘reasonably related to future criminality.’ (Olguin, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 381.) Such a\nreading would effectively eliminate the reasonableness requirement that the court in\nOlguin discusses at some length. (Id. at p. 382.) Requiring Mark to copy his probation\nofficer on all his e-mails, and forward all his postings on social media to his probation\nofficer might also facilitate his probation officer’s supervision of him, as would requiring\nhim to wear a body camera. But Olguin no more justifies these hypothetical probation\nconditions than the actual electronics search condition in this case.” (Mark C., supra, at\np. 533.) Thus, emphasizing that the supervisorial authority juvenile courts have over\nminor probationers, though broad, is not unlimited, Mark C., J.B. and Erica R. gave close\nscrutiny to electronic search conditions under the third prong of Lent, and struck these\nconditions outright where only tenuously justified by concerns about future criminality.5\n(Mark C., supra, at pp. 532-535; J.B., supra, at pp. 755-759; Erica R., supra, 240\nCal.App.4th at pp. 912-915.) As noted, the applicability of Olguin in the present context\nis now pending before the Supreme Court. (See fn. 3, ante.)\n\n       5\n         In so doing, Mark C. emphasized that juvenile probationers, unlike adult\nprobationers, do not have the right to refuse conditions of probation, rather such\nconditions are imposed as an ingredient of a final dispositional order. (Mark C., supra, at\npp. 530, 534.) Mark C. emphasized that juvenile conditions of probation are permissible\nonly if “ ‘ “ ‘ “tailored specifically to meet the needs of the juvenile” ’ ” ’ ” and\nconcluded, “This restriction has particular application to search conditions imposed on\njuveniles.” (Id. at p. 530.)\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       2.     Validity of the electronic search condition under the overbreadth doctrine\n       As explained above, Malik J. was the first case from this district to uphold the\nsearch condition under the Lent test. Division Three then proceeded to an analysis of the\nconstitutional overbreadth doctrine and concluded, in light of its intrusive nature, the\ncondition was overbroad and required narrowing. (Malik J., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 902–904.) “Under the overbreadth doctrine, ‘conditions of probation that impinge on\nconstitutional rights must be tailored carefully and reasonably related to the compelling\nstate interest in reformation and rehabilitation.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 902; see, e.g.,\nVictor L., supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 910.) Malik J. found a “mismatch” in such\ntailoring “because the threat of unfettered searches of Malik’s electronic communications\nsignificantly encroaches on his and potentially third parties’ constitutional rights of\nprivacy and free speech. ‘Modern cell phones are not just another technological\nconvenience. With all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many\nAmericans “the privacies of life,” [citation]. The fact that technology now allows an\nindividual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less\nworthy of the protection for which the Founders fought.’ ” (Malik J., supra, 240\nCal.App.4th at p. 902, quoting Riley v. California (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2680439\"><a href=\"/opinion/2680439/riley-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n2494–2495.)\n       In view of these significant privacy implications, Malik J. held the electronic\nsearch condition had to be “modified to omit the requirement that Malik turn over\npasswords to social media sites and to restrict searches to those electronic devices found\nin his custody and control.” (Malik J., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 902.) But in a twist\nnot appearing in the other cases, Malik J. focused on whether the content legitimately\naccessible to law enforcement was stored on a given device itself, or whether it was\nstored remotely, reasoning that “[i]nformation stored in a remote location cannot be\nconsidered in the probationer’s possession nor entirely within his or her control.” (Id. at\np. 903.) Since the probation condition required disclosure of passwords only to\n“electronic devices” “within [the minor’s] control,” Division Three construed the\nelectronic search condition as self-limiting to data stored on the device, and restricted the\n\n\n                                               12\n\fgovernment’s access to data stored remotely. (Id. at pp. 900, 903-904.) Because\n“identifying whether an electronic device is stolen has no relationship to accessing the\ncontent of [the minor’s] social media accounts” (id. at p. 902), Malik J. modified the\ncondition of probation to allow a search of such electronic devices, so long as they were\nnot attached to the Internet or a cellular connection (id. at pp. 903, 906).6\n       Similarly, Alejandro R. concluded the electronic search condition passed the Lent\ntest and, like Malik J., proceeded to analyze the overbreadth issue. Like Malik J., it also\nfound the electronic search condition to be unconstitutionally overbroad and held it\nrequired narrowing if it was to survive at all. In both cases, privacy concerns tended to\nfigure more prominently at the overbreadth stage of the analysis than they did in the Lent\nstage. (See Alejandro R., supra, at p. 567 [“the applications and Web sites available\nthrough electronic devices contain information ‘ “about all aspects of a person’s life,”\nincluding financial, medical, romantic, and political’ ”]; Malik J., supra, at p. 902\n[“unfettered searches of [a minor’s] electronic communications significantly encroaches\non his and potentially third parties’ constitutional rights of privacy and free speech”].)\n“Because the probation condition as drawn ‘permits review of all sorts of private\ninformation that is highly unlikely to shed any light on whether [the appellant] is\ncomplying with the other conditions of his probation, drug-related or otherwise,’ ”\nAlejandro R. held the condition was overbroad. (Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 567–568.) Accordingly, the court undertook to narrow the condition to bring it\nwithin constitutional bounds. (Id. at p. 568.)\n       But unlike Malik J., Alejandro R. did not modify the electronic search condition to\nensure the searched devices were disconnected from the Internet. Rather, Alejandro R.\nnarrowed it to “media of communication reasonably likely to reveal whether appellant is\n\n       6\n         Division Three narrowed the electronic search condition by allowing probation\nand police officers to access only “electronic devices in Malik’s custody and control\n[and] only after the device has been disabled from any internet or cellular connection and\nwithout utilizing specialized equipment designed to retrieve deleted information that is\nnot readily accessible to users of the device.” (Malik J., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at\np. 906.)\n\n\n                                              13\n\fboasting about drug use or otherwise involved with drugs . . . .” (Alejandro R., supra,\n243 Cal.App.4th at p. 568.) Thus, Division One thought the narrowing of the electronic\nsearch condition should be done on the basis of where likely drug evidence or evidence\nof forbidden associations might be found, rather than where the data was stored.7\n       B.     We Will Vacate the Electronic Search Probation Condition Imposed On\n              L.H. And Remand for Further Development of the Record\n\n       In terms of the seriousness of the minor’s misconduct, our case is more like Erica\nR. and J.B. than Malik J. and Alejandro R. The record in our case contains nothing\nindicating a connection between L.H.’s use of marijuana and any electronic device. He\ndid have two disciplinary incidents at school related to his use of marijuana, he also\ntested positive for marijuana in January 2015, and was found in possession of marijuana\non one occasion , but there is no indication he was involved in drug sales.8 There was\nalso no evidence that L.H. used a cell phone, social media, or the Internet to buy or sell\ndrugs. Thus, there was even less reason to impose the condition on this minor than there\nwas in Erica R. The condition was not reasonably related to L.H.’s past criminal\nconduct, which amounted to nothing more than petty theft. In light of its close similarity\nto J.B., we follow that case in finding the probation condition fails the first prong of the\nLent test. Of course, the probation condition also fails the second prong because\n\n\n\n       7\n         Accordingly, Alejandro R. modified the condition to read as follows: the minor\nmust “[s]ubmit [his] person and any vehicle, room, or property under [his] control to a\nsearch by the probation officer or a peace officer, with or without a search warrant, at any\ntime of the day or night. Submit all electronic devices under [his] control to a search of\nany medium of communication reasonably likely to reveal whether [he is] boasting about\n[his] drug use or otherwise involved with drugs, with or without a search warrant, at any\ntime of the day or night, and provide the probation or peace officer with any passwords\nnecessary to access the information specified. Such media of communication include text\nmessages, voicemail messages, photographs, e-mail accounts, and social media\naccounts.” (Alejandro R., supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at pp. 569–570.)\n       8\n        When L.H. was initially arrested, his companion was in possession of\nconcentrated cannabis, but there is no indication L.H. possessed any drugs. It was\nreported, however, that L.H. was under the influence of marijuana when he was arrested.\n\n\n                                             14\n\fpossession and use of electronic devices is not illegal. (Erica R., supra, 240 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 913.)\n       Having found the probation condition fails to pass the first and second prongs of\nLent, we proceed no further with the analysis. All five of the cases we have discussed\nconcluded that the condition cannot stand as articulated by the juvenile court. Two\nadditional cases on this issue are now pending before the Supreme Court (see fn. 3, ante),\nAlejandro R. is pending on a petition for review (S232240), and the time has not yet\nexpired for the filing of a petition for review in Mark C. Given the present unsettled state\nof the law, we assume without deciding that the condition as written is invalid under\neither the third prong of the Lent test or under the overbreadth doctrine, and will therefore\nvacate the condition at issue here, subject to reinstatement upon remand following\nadditional factual development of the record.\n       We share some of the concerns about privacy that many of our colleagues have\nexpressed in the context of both Lent prong three and the Sheena K. issue of narrowing.\nContent available on a probationer’s electronic device or social media Web site may\ninclude intimate messages and photos, posts from other Web sites which may disclose the\nprobationer’s or the third party’s political and religious affiliations, memberships in clubs\nor organizations, and other sensitive personal information having nothing to do with drug\nuse or forbidden associations. Once a minor has been forced to divulge his or her\npasswords to a probation or police officer, the intrusion upon the minor’s privacy rights\ncan be massive, though much of the information revealed would undoubtedly be\nunrelated to legitimate monitoring by the probation department. Data stored on\nelectronic devices or in social media sites that may reflect criminal behavior or forbidden\nassociations may be so intermingled with other entirely unrelated private information that\nit is not technologically possible to segregate out the protected information from that\nlegitimately open to view by government authorities. But we also recognize that these\nprivacy concerns must be balanced against a strong countervailing state interest in\neffective juvenile probation supervision. That state interest is two-fold. First, juvenile\nprobation serves to protect the public by monitoring wards for future criminality.\n\n\n                                             15\n\fSecond, juvenile wardships are designed to provide maximum opportunity for minors to\nturn their lives around, while satisfying the vital need to give the probation department\nthe tools it needs to help maximize this rehabilitative goal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 550.) The basis for imposing an electronic search condition\nin service of the objectives of juvenile probation will sometimes be manifestly plain,\ngiven the nature of the ward’s criminal record (e.g., a history of violent conduct) or the\nward’s particular rehabilitative needs (e.g., a history of mental illness posing risks to\nothers). For some wards, in short, there may be no meaningful alternative to having what\namounts to an electronic window into every corner of their lives, at all times. But in the\nabsence of public safety or officer safety concerns, these conditions ought not to be\nimposed routinely.\n       The record before us is thin. All we know is that L.H. stole a UPS package off of\nsomeone’s porch, shoplifted a bottle of vodka from a store, and had been disciplined at\nschool for marijuana use and possession. We have no basis to assess the seriousness of\nthe risk of future criminality by L.H., and there is nothing in the record but the broadest\nof generalities to explain why forced turnover of account passwords, in particular, is\nrequired for L.H.’s rehabilitative needs. As a precautionary measure to guard against any\n\n\n                                              16\n\fworsening of the minor’s involvement with drugs, it was of course fully within the\ncourt’s discretion to put in place an additional, more intensive form of drug monitoring,\nbut the reasons for employing an electronic search condition to accomplish that—\ncompared to, say, increased frequency of drug testing—are vague and have no specific\nconnection to the facts of this case. The juvenile court indicated that “minors use the\nInternet to obtain drugs, and they also use the Internet to brag and post photos and\nstatements about themselves using drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia,” but the\nrecord is bereft of anything to indicate why this particular minor might do any of those\nthings or why monitoring his behavior on the Internet is “only way” to detect his drug-\nrelated activity.\n       Equally important, the record here not only contains few details about why an\nelectronic search condition is justified, it is also silent with respect to what kind of\nelectronic devices the minor uses, if in fact he uses any such devices at all,9 and if so,\nwhat apps he uses, and how those devices and applications are used by L.H.\n       Although our colleagues in two of the cases we have discussed have sustained\nsuch conditions under Lent and gone on to resolve overbreadth problems by imposing\nmodifications on appeal (see Sheena K., supra, 40 Cal.4th at pp. 889–892), we believe it\nis inappropriate to take either route here, at least as the record now stands. Before any\ndecision is made on Lent prong three and, if required, on Sheena K. narrowing,\ndevelopment of a more robust factual record is necessary, starting with some specifics\naround the justification for imposing an electronic search condition in the first place. To\ndecide either of these issues on the present record would require that we engage in much\nspeculation about the facts bearing on future criminality, and, if it is necessary to go\nfurther and consider narrowing, about how the scope of permitted electronic search might\nbest be fitted to the minor’s particular electronic communication usage habits. As a\npractical matter, these issues are bound up with one another. Because any saving\n\n\n       9\n        For a juvenile from an economically disadvantaged background, the answer to\nthat question could well be that he does not use any because he cannot afford them.\n\n\n                                              17\n\fmodifications should closely track the specific circumstances justifying imposition of the\nelectronic search condition, thus limiting the scope of permitted search to its justifying\nrationale as far as possible, the juvenile court—working with minor’s counsel, and with\nthe probation department—is best-positioned to assess how any such modifications\nshould be formulated. We will therefore strike the electronic search condition imposed\non L.H., as it is currently framed, and leave to the juvenile court whether the condition\nshould be reinstated, with whatever reasonable narrowing modifications it may wish to\nadopt after further development of the record.\nII.    Probation Conditions Requiring “Good Citizenship,” “Good Conduct,”\n       “Good Behavior,” and Requiring the Minor to “Perform Well” at School and\n       at Work\n       L.H. next challenges the conditions of probation insofar as they require him to “be\nof good conduct” or “good citizenship and good conduct,” and as part of a condition\nrequiring him to attend school and his job on time and regularly, that he “be of good\nbehavior and perform well.” He claims the quoted terms are unconstitutionally vague\nand fail to ensure that the minor himself will be able to ascertain what is required of him\nand conform his behavior accordingly, and also fail to provide an explicit standard for\nthose monitoring his compliance, thereby opening the door to subjective enforcement and\nthe “ ‘ “dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.” ’ ” (Sheena K., supra, 40\nCal.4th at p. 890; see Grayned v. City of Rockford (1972) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108–109.) He\nalso claims the conditions are overbroad. Because we conclude the terms are in some\nrespects unconstitutionally vague, we do not address his overbreadth argument.\n       A.     Forfeiture\n       The People respond that L.H. forfeited this issue by failing to object below and\nthat the juvenile court explained to L.H. what the challenged language in the conditions\nof probation required. An objection to a condition of probation in the trial court is\nordinarily required to preserve that issue for review. Accordingly, People v. Gardineer\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2269028\"><a href=\"/opinion/2269028/people-v-gardineer/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 151–152, refused to address a challenge to an “observe good\nconduct” condition of probation, finding it waived by failure to object.\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       L.H. argues we should reach the merits of his contentions regardless because,\nalthough conduct-related explanations were provided orally to him by the juvenile court,\nhe raises now a challenge to the oral and written conditions of probation which added the\nspecific offending language. The problem with L.H.’s argument with respect to the\n“good conduct” condition is that it was initially imposed orally, and defense counsel\nfailed to object. Had he objected, the court might have explained the conduct\nrequirement in more detail or might have eliminated the challenged language. L.H.\ncontends, however, that we should review the written probation conditions on their face\nunder the rule that probation conditions, unconstitutional on their face and presenting a\npure question of law, may be challenged on appeal despite the failure to object in the trial\ncourt, so long as the alleged error is “capable of correction without reference to the\nparticular sentencing record developed in the trial court.” (Sheena K., supra, 40 Cal.4th\nat pp. 887–888; accord, In re Luis F., supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 181.)\n       Given the claim of facial invalidity, we exercise our discretion to review the “be of\ngood citizenship and good conduct” probation condition, in part because we have twice\nbefore suggested to judges of the Alameda County Superior Court that they oversee the\ndeletion of the “good conduct” condition from the county’s standard forms.10 The court\nhas not heeded our suggestions. We are mindful that modifying forms of this nature\noften takes time and is far more involved than simply making a word processing change,\nbut we are compelled to reiterate our advice as a respectful reminder.\n       We also exercise our discretion to review the condition requiring L.H. to “be of\ngood behavior and perform well” in school and at work. The court did not orally impose\nthe challenged condition and the court’s minute order does not reflect the complained-of\nlanguage. It appears only in a separate written list of “Conditions of Probation and Court\nOrders.” Although the written document shows the minor signed a copy, and presumably\nreceived a copy, on the date of the jurisdiction/ disposition hearing, it appears this was\n\n\n       10\n       In re D.R. (Oct. 28, 2013, A137789) [nonpub. opn.]; In re N.B. (May 21, 2013,\nA136160) [nonpub. opn.].\n\n\n                                             19\n\fnot provided to L.H. until after the oral proceedings were concluded. It thus appears\nthere may not have been an opportunity for his attorney to object to the written\nconditions. We therefore address all of L.H.’s arguments relating to conduct and\nperformance conditions.\n       B.     The “good conduct” condition is unconstitutionally vague and must be\n              stricken\n       The challenged language of the probation order “be of good conduct” is very\nbroad and has been challenged numerous times in this District, oftentimes with success.11\nWe take judicial notice of nonpublished cases noted in footnotes 10 and 11 not to rely on\ntheir legal analysis as precedent, but to demonstrate the regularity with which the issue\nhas been litigated in our District. (Evid. Code, §§ 452, 459; cf. Cal. Rules of Court, rule\n8.1115.) We find the conjoined phrase “good citizenship” to be equally broad and ill-\ndefined.\n       A probation condition is unconstitutionally vague if it is not “ ‘ “sufficiently\nprecise for the probationer to know what is required of him, and for the court to\ndetermine whether the condition has been violated.” ’ [Citation.] A restriction failing\nthis test does not give adequate notice—‘fair warning’—of the conduct proscribed.” (In\nre E.O. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1153.) In determining the adequacy of the notice\ngiven, “we are guided by the principles that ‘abstract legal commands must be applied in\na specific context,’ and that, although not admitting of ‘mathematical certainty,’ the\nlanguage used must have ‘ “reasonable specificity.” ’ ” (Sheena K., supra, 40 Cal.4th at\np. 890; see generally, In re Kevin F. (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357–358.)\n\n\n\n\n       11\n         See, e.g., In re Brandon C. (Feb. 18, 2014, A138960) [nonpub. opn., Division\nTwo; challenge successful]; In re Adrian B. (Apr. 16, 2013, A131529) [nonpub. opn.,\nDivision Two; challenge unsuccessful because condition was explained orally]; In re A.V.\n(Dec. 12, 2012, A133762) [nonpub. opn., Division Five; challenge unsuccessful because\ncondition construed as “obey all laws” condition]; In re A.T. (Feb. 21, 2012, A131996)\n[nonpub. opn., Division Three; challenge successful]; In re N.R. (Dec. 20, 2011,\nA130621) [nonpub. opn., Division Three; challenge successful].\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       With these principles in mind, we conclude that the first probation condition under\nscrutiny is impermissibly vague. The condition that L.H. “be of good citizenship and\ngood conduct” lacks specificity and fails to provide meaningful guidance to L.H. or the\ncourt in determining what conduct is prohibited, and the People have not offered any\nsuggestions as to what the condition actually requires. They have only argued that the\ncourt gave “comprehensive explanations of the culled phrases . . . challenged on appeal.”\nWhile we agree that the court explained orally what it means to “be of good behavior” at\nschool, we see nothing in the court’s admonitions clarifying what it means to “be of good\ncitizenship and good conduct” more generally.\n       Arguably, the condition serves as a catchall label for other conditions imposed,\nsuch as directives that L.H. obey all laws, obey his parents, attend school, abide by his\ncurfew, refrain from using drugs or alcohol, stay away from others who use drugs and\nalcohol, and the other conduct-related conditions recited above. But since each of the\nother conditions was spelled out individually on the “Conditions of Probation and Court\nOrders,” adding a separate non-specific catchall for already-imposed specific conditions\nis duplicative and unnecessary, and it provides no notice of additional prohibited\nbehavior. Because it is impermissibly vague and serves no legitimate purpose that we\ncan discern, the condition instructing L.H. generally to “be of good citizenship and good\nconduct” was improperly imposed.\n       C.     The “good behavior and perform well” condition must be stricken as it\n              applies to the minor’s work, but not as it applies to his school participation\n       The “good behavior” component of the challenged school and work condition\nsuffers from the same vagueness concerns present in the “good conduct” condition.\nLikewise, the “perform well” language is imprecise and subjective. (See In re Angel J.\n(1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1101 (Angel J.).) At school, this directive could encompass\nmore than just grades, such as attendance or participation. Indeed, even a probation\ncondition requiring the minor to maintain “satisfactory grades” has been held too vague\nto be enforced. (Id. at pp. 1101–1102.) The court in Angel J. held that in order to pass\nconstitutional muster, the term “satisfactory” required a more specific definition. (Id. at\n\n\n                                             21\n\fp. 1102.) Angel J. defined “satisfactory grades” as passing grades in each graded subject\n(i.e., a D or above in an A through F grading system) and modified the condition of\nprobation accordingly. (Ibid. & fn. 7.)\n       But we think the court’s detailed oral explanations in this case adequately defined\nthe terms “good behavior” and “perform well” with respect to school participation so as\nto allow the condition to pass constitutional muster. By giving detailed direction for\ngrades, attendance and more, it gave shape to the vague language contained in the written\nprobation conditions. We therefore agree with the People that the “be of good behavior\nand perform well” condition of probation was adequately explained orally by the judge\ninsofar as school participation and performance were concerned. Sheena K., supra, 40\nCal.4th at page 891, recognized that “a probation condition that otherwise would be\ndeemed vague may be constitutional because the juvenile court offered additional oral or\nwritten comments clarifying” its meaning. (Accord, In re Kevin F., supra, 239\nCal.App.4th at p. 358.)\n       In the present case the court did just that with respect to the challenged condition\nas it related to school behavior and performance. Specifically, the juvenile court\ninstructed L.H. that he is not to be on any campus or school grounds unless enrolled, or\naccompanied by an adult, or authorized by the school staff; and he must attend school\n“every day on time . . . every class on time, stay through the entirety of every class, do all\n. . . homework, and pass all . . . classes.” Additionally, L.H. was told he must “obey all\nschool rules and regulations,” and he is not to “leave the school campus without\npermission of school officials or the Probation Officer.” The court more than once orally\nadmonished L.H. that his “main focus” should be on “school, school, school,” leaving no\ndoubt that the court expected him to attend regularly, obey the rules, and attain passing\ngrades. This same formula for success in school had been driven home by the court from\nearly on in the proceedings because L.H. had been receiving poor grades (“all Fs and one\nD”). L.H. showed significant improvement in school after receiving that advice from the\ncourt. Thus, we infer L.H. understood what was required, and we find the condition as\nimposed in this case was not vague or overbroad with respect to the minor’s expected\n\n\n                                             22\n\fschool participation. We do not find it necessary to modify the “be of good behavior and\nperform well” clause.\n       While “be of good behavior and perform well” could be called surplusage in the\ncontext of school performance, given the court’s more specific oral explanation, having\nthat language embodied in the written conditions of probation (which apparently were\ngiven to L.H.) may serve as a reminder to him that he must not only attend school but\nalso must do his homework, achieve passing grades, and obey school rules. Accordingly,\nwe do not deem it necessary to strike the written condition, as that might signal to L.H.\nthat attendance alone is required, thereby undercutting the court’s supervisory power over\nhim. Nor do we modify the condition because its scope was defined by the oral\npronouncements. The inclusion of the umbrella phrases “good behavior” and “perform\nwell” does not offend the constitution. With respect to the “good citizenship and good\nconduct” condition, which relates to the minor’s overall behavior and as to which no oral\nguidelines were provided, we opt to strike the vague language as unhelpful and\nmeaningless surplusage. The catchall language in the school attendance and performance\ncondition is different in that it bears additional meaning by triggering operation of the\norally imposed conditions, which were not otherwise prescribed in writing. Therefore we\nconclude the language need not be stricken from the probation condition insofar as school\nparticipation is concerned.\n       With respect to being of good behavior and performing well at work, on the other\nhand, the minor did not receive clarifying instruction. The court’s oral pronouncements\nprovided no guidance as to how L.H. could “perform well” at a job, which lacks the\nstructure of the grading system used to define satisfactory performance in Angel J., supra,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at page 1102 and footnote 7. Therefore, as applied to work\nparticipation the probation condition remains unacceptably vague and is invalid. The\n“good behavior” component is unconstitutionally vague for the same reasons the “be of\ngood conduct” clause is unconstitutionally vague. The “perform well” component is\nvague because standards of performing well vary by work setting and by supervisor.\nL.H. was not employed at the time of the hearing, but was seeking employment, and the\n\n\n                                             23\n\fcourt’s main advice about work was not to let it interfere with school: “Work is good, and\nthat’s very important, because it’s a way of getting money, but school is the main focus.\nAnd the nice thing about these [job] programs, they’ll never put you in a work situation\nthat will in any way make it more difficult to do school. It’s supposed to be a nice\ncompliment [sic] to school. [¶] So school, school, school.” L.H. was given no standards\nby which his behavior on the job would be judged and no explanation of what was\nrequired before the court would consider him to be performing well. The language must\nbe stricken from the probation condition with respect to work participation. This may be\naccomplished simply by striking the words “or job” from the written condition.\nIII.   Maximum Term of Confinement\n       Finally, L.H. argues that the court erred in setting a maximum term of confinement\nbecause he was not removed from parental custody, and the establishment of a maximum\nterm of confinement was not only unnecessary, but unauthorized. Section 726,\nsubdivision (d)(1) provides: “(1) If the minor is removed from the physical custody of\nhis or her parent or guardian as the result of an order of wardship made pursuant to\nSection 602, the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical\nconfinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be\nimposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued\nthe minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.” Given the introductory clause,\nseveral cases have held it is improper for a court to set a maximum term of confinement\nin a case where the minor is not removed from the parental home.

As one court noted, the erroneous inclusion of the term has “no\nlegal effect” and thus causes no prejudice. (Ali A., supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 574.)\nAccordingly, the Third District held it was not necessary to order the maximum term of\nconfinement stricken from the order. (Ibid.)\n\n\n                                             24\n\f       The courts that have provided a remedy have done so for prophylactic reasons.\nThe Second District, Division Eight, held not only that the statute did not empower\njuvenile courts to specify a maximum term if the minor was not being removed from the\nparental home, but found that “criticism of this practice in prior opinions without actually\nordering a correction of the disposition seems to have had little effect.” (Matthew A.,\nsupra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 541.) Therefore, the court ordered the statement in the\ndisposition order stricken. (Ibid.) More recently, the Third District reversed the position\nit took in Ali A. and agreed with Matthew A. as to the appropriate disposition. “[T]he\nerror of including maximum terms in noncustodial orders continues, unnecessarily\ndepleting the limited resources of the judicial system. To stop this error, and quell the\ndebate over its effect, we now conclude that where a juvenile court’s order includes a\nmaximum confinement term for a minor who is not removed from parental custody, the\nremedy is to strike the term.” (A.C., supra, 224 Cal.App.4th at p. 592.)\n       The People rely on In re P.A., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in which the Fourth\nDistrict, Division Two, held it was not error for the court to mention the maximum term\nof confinement at a jurisdictional hearing. (Id. at pp. 31–32.) Because “the juvenile\ncourt did not mention a maximum term of confinement at the disposition hearing or in its\ndispositional order,” the court found no error and no remedy was necessary. (Ibid.) We\nagree that because the court in our case mentioned the maximum term of confinement\nonly during the plea colloquy at the jurisdictional hearing, there was no judicial error. 12\n(Cf. In re M.G. (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1275, fn. 4.)\n\n\n\n\n       12\n          The reporter’s transcript reflects only two mentions of the maximum term of\nconfinement, both at the jurisdictional phase of the hearing. The defense attorney, not the\njudge, first mentioned it. Asked to voir dire his client, defense counsel advised L.H.,\namong other things, “The maximum possible consequence for this admission is up to six\nmonths in a locked facility. Do you understand that?” L.H. responded, “Yes.” The\njudge thereafter asked L.H. “having all your rights in mind as well as the possible\nconfinement in a locked facility for up to six months,” whether he admitted or denied the\npetty theft allegation of the petition, and L.H. admitted it.\n\n\n                                              25\n\f       The minute order in our case, however, unlike that in In re P.A., supra, does\nreflect as one of the court’s orders: “The maximum time the child may be confined in\nsecure custody for the offenses sustained in the petition before the court is 6 months.”\nThis appears to have been a clerical error. Because the same written order served as both\na jurisdictional and dispositional order, it should not have included a maximum term of\nconfinement. Because we remand for other modifications, we will order that sentence\nstricken from the minute order under the pragmatic reasoning of A.C., supra, 224\nCal.App.4th at page 592 and Matthew A., supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at page 541.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The conditions of probation are modified as follows: (1) by striking the language\n“electronic including passwords” from the search condition of probation reflected in the\nminute order and the words “electronics and passwords” from the “Conditions of\nProbation and Court Orders” (collectively, the “Electronic Search Condition”); (2) by\nstriking the language “be of good citizenship and good conduct” from the “Conditions of\nProbation and Court Orders” each time it appears; (3) by striking the language “or job”\nfrom the condition requiring L.H. to “attend classes or job on time and regularly; be of\ngood behavior and perform well”; and (4) by striking from the minute order dated\nFebruary 9, 2015, the language: “The maximum time the child may be confined in secure\ncustody for the offenses sustained in the petition before the court is 6 months.” The case\nis remanded for fuller development of a record that would support narrowing\nmodifications to the Electronic Search Condition, should the court decide to reimpose\nsuch a condition. The Electronic Search Condition may be reinstated upon remand,\nsubject to such modifications. In all other respects the dispositional order is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f                                 _________________________\n                                 Streeter, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nRuvolo, P.J.\n\n\n_________________________\nReardon, J.\n\n\n\n\nA144397/In re L.H.\n\n\n                            27\n\f</pre>",
