Overview\n\n      Plaintiffs appeal the district court's final dismissal of\n\ntheir action and declaration that the school board has eliminated\n\nits   dual   education   system,   thereby   achieving   unitary   status.\n\nFinding that the district court did not clearly err, we affirm.\n\n                             II. Background\n\n      Plaintiffs, who were black schoolchildren, filed this class\n\naction in 1964 seeking desegregation of Muscogee County schools.\n\nThe district court twice denied Plaintiffs relief, and the Fifth\n\nCircuit affirmed both denials.           Lockett v. Board of Educ. of\n\n      *\n      Honorable John H. Moore, II, Senior U.S. District Judge for\nthe Middle District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n\fMuscogee County, 391 F.2d 272 (5th Cir.1968);       Lockett v. Board of\n\nEduc. of Muscogee County, 342 F.2d 225 (5th Cir.1965).\n\n     The district court revisited the case in 1971 after the\n\nSupreme Court decided Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 391\n\nU.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), and           Swann v.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554\n\n(1971).   It ordered the school board to present and implement a\n\ndesegregation plan consistent with the Swann principles.       Lockett\n\nv. Board of Educ. of Muscogee County, 442 F.2d 1336 (5th Cir.1971).\n\nIn response, the school board submitted the following plan:\n\n   AMENDED PLAN TO DESEGREGATE THE SCHOOLS OF MUSCOGEE COUNTY,\nGEORGIA\n\n          The [school board,] in continuation of its effort to\n     unify its schools to eliminate every vestige of discrimination\n     because of race or color of its students and to maintain a\n     fully desegregated system, hereby adopts this Amended Plan of\n     Desegregation so as to fully comply with the law in such cases\n     made and provided. The percentage of white and Negro students\n     attending the school [sic] in this County are approximately\n     70% white and 30% Negro, and it is the purpose and intent of\n     this Board to obtain approximate proportionate representation\n     of each race in each school in the most efficient manner;\n\n                  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:\n\n                       .      .    .    .       .\n\n                           STUDENT ASSIGNMENT\n\n          All white students, equal in number to 70% of the\n     capacity of the school to which they have been assigned,\n     living nearest to said school, and all Negro students, equal\n     in number to 30% of the capacity of the school to which they\n     have been assigned, living nearest to said school, shall\n     attend said school for the year beginning in September, 1971.\n\n          All other students assigned to said school shall be\n     assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the school\n     nearest to the residence of said student which does not then\n     have its quota of white or Negro students as above stated.\n\n          All students who have not been assigned to any school for\n     the current Fall term, or who later enter the School System,\n\f      shall be assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the\n      school nearest the residence of said student which then has\n      space available and has less than its quota of white or Negro\n      students, as the case may be, then assigned to said school.\n\n           There shall be no transfer or assignment of any student\n      during the entire school year, except in case, absent the\n      consideration of race, a change is educationally called for or\n      where compelling hardship or other good reason is shown by the\n      student.\n\n           In school years after the school year beginning in\n      September, 1971, the Board of Education, prior to the end of\n      such school year, shall determine the approximate percentage\n      of white and Negro students attending the school in this\n      District and assignment of students shall be made as above\n      provided so that the approximate number of white and Negro\n      students in each school shall be substantially the same as the\n      percentage of white and Negro students in the entire School\n      System.\n\n      The school board amended this plan in 1972.            The amendment\n\nexempted first graders and kindergartners and stated that the\n\n\"quota or percentage of white and Negro students in each school in\n\nthe next school term shall be substantially the same as is the\n\npercentage of white and Negro students in the entire school system\n\nat the end of the current school term.\"               The district court\n\napproved both the proposed plan and the 1972 amendment by court\n\norder and retained jurisdiction to supervise the school board.\n\n      In   furtherance   of   the   plan's   goals,    the   school   board\n\nimplemented student reassignment and attendance zone adjustments.\n\nBy 1973, the proportion of majority to minority students in 57 of\n\nthe 64 Muscogee County schools was within 10% of the proportion of\n\nthe races in the County as a whole, and 5 schools fell within a 20%\n\nrange. Roughly the same compositions were maintained through 1977.\n\n      Toward the end of the 1970s, the school board began reducing\n\nthe   number   of   student    reassignments     and    attendance     zone\n\nadjustments.     At the same time, county demographics began to\n\fchange,   resulting     in     racially   polarized   residential    areas,   a\n\ndecrease in the number of white students, and an increase in the\n\nnumber    of   black    students.         By   the   mid-1980s,    the   racial\n\ncompositions within many of the schools were disproportionate with\n\nthe county-wide student racial composition, and by 1991, several\n\nracially identifiable schools existed.\n\n     Plaintiffs therefore moved in 1991 for an injunction and an\n\norder directing the school board to take whatever action necessary\n\nto achieve proportionate student compositions.             The district court\n\ndenied the motion as moot because the original class of Plaintiffs\n\nwere no longer students.           This court reversed and remanded for\n\nconsideration of the motion on its merits.                Lockett v. Board of\n\nEduc. of Muscogee County Sch. Dist., 976 F.2d 648 (11th Cir.1992).\n\nBefore the district court decided the motion on remand, the school\n\nboard    met   with    black    and   white    citizens   and   Parent-Teacher\n\nAssociation representatives from majority black and majority white\n\nschools. With support from these citizens and representatives, the\n\nschool board implemented a neighborhood-school plan that eliminated\n\ncross-district busing and called for students to be assigned to\n\nlocal neighborhood-schools.           The school board also proposed magnet\n\nprograms and majority-to-minority transfer programs to off-set any\n\nnegative impact that the neighborhood assignment plan might have on\n\nracial composition within the schools.            Plaintiffs moved to enjoin\n\nthe neighborhood-school plan in 1992 and in 1993.                 The district\n\ncourt denied both motions, finding no irreparable harm.\n\n     The school district then moved for final dismissal of the 1971\n\norder and for a declaration of unitary status in an effort to have\n\fthe district court divest itself of jurisdiction.             Following an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the district court granted the motion.\n\n                       III. Standard of Review\n\n     We review a district court's declaration that a school system\n\nhas achieved unitary status under the clearly erroneous standard.\n\nJacksonville Branch, NAACP v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 883 F.2d 945,\n\n952 n. 3 (11th Cir.1989).   Under this standard, we are not entitled\n\nto \"reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because [we\n\nare] convinced that [we] would have decided the case differently.\n\n[We] overstep[ ] the bounds of [our] duty under Rule 52(a) if [we]\n\nundertake[ ] to duplicate the role of the lower court....            Where\n\nthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's\n\nchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson v. City\n\nof Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct.\n\n1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).\n\n                            IV. Discussion\n\n     In Brown v. Board of Ed., 347 U.S. 483, 495, 74 S.Ct. 686,\n\n692, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (Brown I ), the Supreme Court recognized\n\nthat state-compelled segregation in schools violates the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment's Equal Protection Clause.        To effectuate       Brown I's\n\nmandate, the Supreme Court ordered district courts to supervise\n\nschool boards that had practiced de jure segregation in their\n\ndesegregation efforts.    Brown v. Board of Ed., 349 U.S. 294, 301,\n\n75 S.Ct. 753, 757, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955) (Brown II ).              District\n\ncourts   maintained   supervision   by   issuing   remedial    orders   and\n\nasserting jurisdiction over school boards to ensure compliance with\n\nthose orders.\n\f       The Supreme Court intended this federal supervision of local\n\nschool systems to be a temporary measure.                             Board of Educ. of\n\nOklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 247, 111 S.Ct. 630, 637, 112\n\nL.Ed.2d      715    (1991).      Since          the    legal      justification    for    such\n\nsupervision is a constitutional violation by local authorities, a\n\ndistrict       court    must    divest          itself      of    jurisdiction     when    the\n\nconstitutional violation has ceased and when local authorities have\n\noperated in compliance with a desegregation decree for a reasonable\n\nperiod of time.        Id. at 248, 111 S.Ct. at 637;                  see also Freeman v.\n\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 489, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1445, 118 L.Ed.2d 108\n\n(1992) (\"[T]he ultimate objective [is] to return school districts\n\nto    the    control    of    local    authorities.\").                A   district   court's\n\ndecision       to    divest     itself       of       jurisdiction        \"recognizes     that\n\n\"necessary concern for the important values of local control of\n\npublic school systems dictates that a federal court's regulatory\n\ncontrol of such systems not extend beyond the time required to\n\nremedy the effects of past intentional discrimination.' \"                            Dowell,\n\n498     U.S.    at     247,    111     S.Ct.           at   637     (citations    omitted).\n\nCounterbalancing this recognition is the acknowledgment that \"the\n\npotential for discrimination and racial hostility is still present\n\nin our country, and its manifestations may emerge in new and subtle\n\nforms       after    the     effects       of     de    jure      segregation     have    been\n\neliminated.\"         Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490, 112 S.Ct. at 1445.\n\n         To ensure that local authorities are not continuing to\n\npractice       discrimination,         a    district        court's       determination    of\n\nwhether local authorities have complied with a desegregation decree\n\ninvolves a careful assessment of the facts.                         Id. at 474, 112 S.Ct.\n\fat 1437. Utilizing sound discretion after a such a careful factual\n\nassessment, a district court must determine (1) whether the local\n\nauthorities have eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to\n\nthe extent practicable and (2) whether the local authorities have\n\nin good faith fully and satisfactorily complied with, and shown a\n\ncommitment to, the desegregation plan. Lee v. Etowah County Bd. of\n\nEduc., 963 F.2d 1416, 1425 (11th Cir.1992) (citing Dowell, 498 U.S.\n\nat 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 638).\n\n     In determining whether the local authorities have eliminated\n\nthe vestiges of de jure segregation as far as practicable, a\n\ndistrict    court   must   examine   six   facets   of    school    operation:\n\nstudent    assignments,    faculty    assignments,       staff   assignments,\n\ntransportation,     extra-curricular       activities,     and     facilities.\n\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245, 111 S.Ct. at 636 (quoting Green, 391 U.S.\n\nat 435, 88 S.Ct. at 1693 (1968)).          In its discretion, a district\n\ncourt may consider other facets.           Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1446.\n\n     Here, the district court limited the bulk of its discussion to\n\nstudent assignments because the parties agreed that the school\n\nsystem has eliminated the vestiges of de jure segregation as far as\n\npracticable in the areas of faculty assignments, staff assignments,\n\ntransportation, extra-curricular activities, and facilities.1              We\n\ndo the same.\n\n         Where, as here, a school board has a history of practicing\n\nsegregation, a district court must presume that substantially\n\n     1\n      The district court, in a proper exercise of its discretion,\ndid not consider other facets of school operations such as\nquality of education, and neither party requested that it do so.\n\fdisproportionate       racial    compositions    within     the     schools   is\n\nconstitutionally violative.           Swann, 402 U.S. at 25, 91 S.Ct. at\n\n1281. To overcome this presumption, a school board must prove that\n\nthe imbalances are not the result of present or past discrimination\n\non its part.     Id.\n\n     The school board sought to prove through expert witnesses that\n\nthe current student imbalances and imbalances during the 1980's\n\nwere not the result of present or past discrimination.                    Those\n\nwitnesses testified that the current racial imbalances were the\n\nresult of dramatic demographic changes in Muscogee County, such as\n\nan increase in the number of black school-age children and a\n\ndecrease   in    the   number    of   white   school-age    children.         The\n\ndemographic change, according to one expert, was a result of\n\nfactors over which the school board had no control, such as a\n\ndecrease in the white fertility rate, a difference in purchasing\n\npower between white and black families, a preference of white and\n\nblack families to live in neighborhoods composed of families of a\n\nsimilar race, and the location of housing projects.                 (R2-19-21).\n\nBased on this evidence and the fact that other experts did not\n\ncontradict this evidence, the district court concluded that the\n\nschool   board   proved   that    the   imbalances   were    \"the    result   of\n\nvoluntary housing patterns and demographic change.\"               (R2-23).\n\n     The district court's conclusion was not clearly erroneous. It\n\nwas based on expert opinion \"consistent with the mobility that is\n\na distinct characteristic of our society.\"           Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n493, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.         And while\n\n     [i]n one sense of the term, vestiges of past segregation by\n     state decree do remain in our society and in our schools....\n\f     [as a stubborn fact of history, we must not] overstate its\n     consequences in fixing legal responsibilities....      It is\n     simply not always the case that demographic forces causing\n     population change bear any real and substantial relation to a\n     de jure violation[,] [a]nd the law need not proceed on that\n     premise.\n\nId. at 495-96, 112 S.Ct. at 1448.              Further, \"[a]s the          de jure\n\nviolation becomes more remote in time and ... demographic changes\n\nintervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance\n\nin a school district is a vestige of the prior de jure system.                   The\n\ncausal link between current conditions and the prior violation is\n\neven more attenuated if the school district has demonstrated its\n\ngood faith [commitment to a desegregation plan.]\"                  Id. at 496, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1448.\n\n       A    good    faith   commitment    to    a   desegregation        plan   also\n\ndemonstrates to parents, students, and the public that students\n\nwill no longer suffer injury or stigma.                   At the same time, it\n\n\"enables    the     district   court     to    accept      the    school   board's\n\nrepresentation that [the school board] has accepted the principle\n\nof racial equality and will not suffer intentional discrimination\n\nin the future.\"      Id. at 498, 112 S.Ct. at 1449.              To determine if a\n\nschool board has shown a good faith commitment to a desegregation\n\nplan, a district court should, among other things, consider whether\n\nthe school board's policies \"form a consistent pattern of lawful\n\nconduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.\"                    Id. at 491,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 1446.\n\n     Here, the district court concluded that the school board has\n\nin   good   faith     shown    a   commitment       to,   and     has   fully    and\n\nsatisfactorily complied with, the desegregation plan generally and\n\nin those aspects specifically related to student assignments.                    The\n\fdistrict court, which has monitored the actions of the school board\n\nfor   over   30   years,   reached   this   conclusion   based   on   several\n\nfindings.     First, it found that it has never had to enjoin or\n\nsanction the school board.      Second, it found that the school board\n\nnever failed to comply with a court order.2         Third, it found that\n\nthe school board took actions to further desegregation which went\n\nabove and beyond what the 1971 order as amended required.             Fourth,\n\nit found that the school board kept desegregation of its schools at\n\na level not surpassed by any school district in the country for ten\n\nyears, even in the face of countervailing demographic factors.\n\nFifth, it found that the school board implemented magnet programs\n\nwhich, at least in one instance, helped to racially balance an\n\notherwise unbalanced school. Sixth, it found that the school board\n\nadopted the neighborhood assignment plan only after listening to\n\nthe views of black and white citizens (both groups favored the\n\nplan) and PTA representatives from majority white and majority\n\nblack schools (both groups opposed an alternative plan).3 Seventh,\n\n      2\n      As part of this finding, the district court interpreted its\n1971 order as amended to require the school district only to\nachieve proportionate representation for the 1972-73 school year.\nWe should give effect to that interpretation. See Cornist et al.\nv. Richland Parish School Board, 495 F.2d 189, 191 (5th Cir.1974)\n(stating that in a desegregation case, the district judge\n\"construed his own order, as he was entitled to do\"); Vulcan\nTools of Puerto Rico v. Makita USA, Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 566 (1st\nCir.1994) (\"[W]e are loathe to upset a district court's\ninterpretation of its own order.\").\n      3\n      We should not treat the adoption of the neighborhood\nassignment plan as a breach of good faith on the part of the\nschool board. In Lockett v. Board of Educ. of Muscogee County,\nNo. 93-8966 (11th Cir. July 21, 1994), we affirmed the district\ncourt's decision allowing the school district to continue the\nplan as consistent with the underlying desegregation plan. Cf.\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249 n. 1, 111 S.Ct. at 638 n. 1 (\"The Court\nof Appeals viewed the Board's adoption of [a particular plan] as\n\fit found that the school board implemented a majority to minority\n\ntransfer program in 1992 to offset any racial impact that the\n\nneighborhood assignment plan could have.         (R2-40).   In addition to\n\nthese specific findings, the district court noted generally that\n\n\"[e]very expert who testified in this case expressed praise in\n\nvarying degrees for the desegregation efforts of the [school\n\nboard].\"     (R. 2-55.)    The district court's findings were based on\n\nuncontradicted evidence and fully support the district court's\n\nconclusion that the school board has shown a good faith commitment\n\nto and compliance with the desegregation plan. This conclusion was\n\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\n                                V. Conclusion\n\n     The district court's conclusions that the school board has\n\neliminated     the   vestiges   of   de   jure   segregation   as   far   as\n\npracticable and that the school board has shown a good faith\n\ncommitment to and compliance with the desegregation plan were not\n\nclearly erroneous.        Accordingly, we affirm the district court's\n\nfinal dismissal and declaration that the school board has attained\n\nunitary status.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n     BARKETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n     Although I believe this is a very close case and guidance in\n\nthis area of the law is vague, I respectfully differ from the\n\ncourt's decision to rehear this case because I am concerned about\n\n\na violation of its obligation under the injunction, and\ntechnically it may well have been. But ... we do not think that\nthe Board should be penalized for relying on the express language\nof that order.\").\n\fthe Muscogee County School District's actions, and inaction, during\n\nthe last fifteen years that it was subject to the desegregation\n\ndecree.\n\n     Regardless of the age of a desegregation decree, such a decree\n\nmay only be terminated upon a showing that a school district has\n\neliminated all vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the maximum\n\nextent practicable and has complied in good faith with both the\n\ndecree and the spirit of Brown 's mandate.1       Board of Ed. of\n\nOklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249-50, 111 S.Ct. 630, 638,\n\n112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991);    Lee v. Etowah County Bd. of Educ., 963\n\nF.2d 1416, 1425 (11th Cir.1992).\n\n     No one disputes that de facto segregation now exists in the\n\nschool district.   It is also clear that prior de jure segregation\n\nresulted from unconstitutional practices by the school district.\n\nThe school district had the burden of demonstrating that the\n\ncurrent imbalances are not vestiges of those past policies or\n\npractices.   See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg, 402 U.S. 1, 25, 91\n\nS.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).       The district court\n\ndetermined that the racial imbalances were not caused by the school\n\n     1\n      In its Petition for Rehearing, the School Board repeatedly\nsuggests that a school district satisfies its obligations once it\nadopts a racially neutral system of student assignment. See\nPetition for Rehearing at 7 (\"federal courts simply have no\nauthority to enforce orders solely to achieve racial balance once\na racially neutral system of student assignment has effectively\nbeen adopted\") & 12 (\"there is no affirmative duty [to remedy\nracial imbalances] after a school system has successfully\nimplemented a school desegregation plan\"). However, I believe\nPetitioner confuses the means of its remedial obligations with\nthe ends. Although implementing a racially neutral attendance\npattern is a necessary remedial device, \"[a] remedy is\njustifiable only insofar as it advances the ultimate objective of\nalleviating the initial constitutional violation.\" Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 489, 112 S.Ct. at 1445 (emphasis added).\n\fsystem but, in doing so, focused only on demographic changes in the\n\ncounty.   The court failed to consider whether the school board's\n\ntotal curtailment of any desegregation efforts after about 1980\n\nhelped    preserve   or   perpetuate   the   effects   of   its   prior\n\nunconstitutional policies.     The district court's narrow approach\n\nerroneously assumed that as long as a school district can point to\n\nsome force not directly related to a school district's overt\n\nactions which is causing or exacerbating racial imbalances, then\n\nthe resulting imbalance is not traceable to past practices.       I do\n\nnot believe that this approach comports with the proper burdens of\n\nproof or the analytic framework set out in Freeman v. Pitts, 503\n\nU.S. 467, 494, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1447, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).\n\f",

The percentage of white and Negro students\n     attending the school [sic] in this County are approximately\n     70% white and 30% Negro, and it is the purpose and intent of\n     this Board to obtain approximate proportionate representation\n     of each race in each school in the most efficient manner;\n\n                  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:\n\n                       .      .    .    .       .\n\n                           STUDENT ASSIGNMENT\n\n          All white students, equal in number to 70% of the\n     capacity of the school to which they have been assigned,\n     living nearest to said school, and all Negro students, equal\n     in number to 30% of the capacity of the school to which they\n     have been assigned, living nearest to said school, shall\n     attend said school for the year beginning in September, 1971.\n\n          All other students assigned to said school shall be\n     assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the school\n     nearest to the residence of said student which does not then\n     have its quota of white or Negro students as above stated.\n\n          All students who have not been assigned to any school for\n     the current Fall term, or who later enter the School System,\n\f      shall be assigned by the Superintendent and his staff to the\n      school nearest the residence of said student which then has\n      space available and has less than its quota of white or Negro\n      students, as the case may be, then assigned to said school.\n\n           There shall be no transfer or assignment of any student\n      during the entire school year, except in case, absent the\n      consideration of race, a change is educationally called for or\n      where compelling hardship or other good reason is shown by the\n      student.\n\n           In school years after the school year beginning in\n      September, 1971, the Board of Education, prior to the end of\n      such school year, shall determine the approximate percentage\n      of white and Negro students attending the school in this\n      District and assignment of students shall be made as above\n      provided so that the approximate number of white and Negro\n      students in each school shall be substantially the same as the\n      percentage of white and Negro students in the entire School\n      System.\n\n      The school board amended this plan in 1972.            The amendment\n\nexempted first graders and kindergartners and stated that the\n\n\"quota or percentage of white and Negro students in each school in\n\nthe next school term shall be substantially the same as is the\n\npercentage of white and Negro students in the entire school system\n\nat the end of the current school term.\"               The district court\n\napproved both the proposed plan and the 1972 amendment by court\n\norder and retained jurisdiction to supervise the school board.\n\n      In   furtherance   of   the   plan's   goals,    the   school   board\n\nimplemented student reassignment and attendance zone adjustments.\n\nBy 1973, the proportion of majority to minority students in 57 of\n\nthe 64 Muscogee County schools was within 10% of the proportion of\n\nthe races in the County as a whole, and 5 schools fell within a 20%\n\nrange. Roughly the same compositions were maintained through 1977.\n\n      Toward the end of the 1970s, the school board began reducing\n\nthe   number   of   student    reassignments     and    attendance     zone\n\nadjustments.     At the same time, county demographics began to\n\fchange,   resulting     in     racially   polarized   residential    areas,   a\n\ndecrease in the number of white students, and an increase in the\n\nnumber    of   black    students.         By   the   mid-1980s,    the   racial\n\ncompositions within many of the schools were disproportionate with\n\nthe county-wide student racial composition, and by 1991, several\n\nracially identifiable schools existed.\n\n     Plaintiffs therefore moved in 1991 for an injunction and an\n\norder directing the school board to take whatever action necessary\n\nto achieve proportionate student compositions.             The district court\n\ndenied the motion as moot because the original class of Plaintiffs\n\nwere no longer students.           This court reversed and remanded for\n\nconsideration of the motion on its merits.                Lockett v. Board of\n\nEduc. of Muscogee County Sch.

With support from these citizens and representatives, the\n\nschool board implemented a neighborhood-school plan that eliminated\n\ncross-district busing and called for students to be assigned to\n\nlocal neighborhood-schools.           The school board also proposed magnet\n\nprograms and majority-to-minority transfer programs to off-set any\n\nnegative impact that the neighborhood assignment plan might have on\n\nracial composition within the schools.            Plaintiffs moved to enjoin\n\nthe neighborhood-school plan in 1992 and in 1993.                 The district\n\ncourt denied both motions, finding no irreparable harm.\n\n     The school district then moved for final dismissal of the 1971\n\norder and for a declaration of unitary status in an effort to have\n\fthe district court divest itself of jurisdiction.

In its discretion, a district\n\ncourt may consider other facets.           Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1446.\n\n     Here, the district court limited the bulk of its discussion to\n\nstudent assignments because the parties agreed that the school\n\nsystem has eliminated the vestiges of de jure segregation as far as\n\npracticable in the areas of faculty assignments, staff assignments,\n\ntransportation, extra-curricular activities, and facilities.1              We\n\ndo the same.\n\n         Where, as here, a school board has a history of practicing\n\nsegregation, a district court must presume that substantially\n\n     1\n      The district court, in a proper exercise of its discretion,\ndid not consider other facets of school operations such as\nquality of education, and neither party requested that it do so.\n\fdisproportionate       racial    compositions    within     the     schools   is\n\nconstitutionally violative.           Swann, 402 U.S. at 25, 91 S.Ct. at\n\n1281. To overcome this presumption, a school board must prove that\n\nthe imbalances are not the result of present or past discrimination\n\non its part.     Id.\n\n     The school board sought to prove through expert witnesses that\n\nthe current student imbalances and imbalances during the 1980's\n\nwere not the result of present or past discrimination.                    Those\n\nwitnesses testified that the current racial imbalances were the\n\nresult of dramatic demographic changes in Muscogee County, such as\n\nan increase in the number of black school-age children and a\n\ndecrease   in    the   number    of   white   school-age    children.         The\n\ndemographic change, according to one expert, was a result of\n\nfactors over which the school board had no control, such as a\n\ndecrease in the white fertility rate, a difference in purchasing\n\npower between white and black families, a preference of white and\n\nblack families to live in neighborhoods composed of families of a\n\nsimilar race, and the location of housing projects.                 (R2-19-21).\n\nBased on this evidence and the fact that other experts did not\n\ncontradict this evidence, the district court concluded that the\n\nschool   board   proved   that    the   imbalances   were    \"the    result   of\n\nvoluntary housing patterns and demographic change.\"               (R2-23).\n\n     The district court's conclusion was not clearly erroneous. It\n\nwas based on expert opinion \"consistent with the mobility that is\n\na distinct characteristic of our society.\"           Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n493, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.         And while\n\n     [i]n one sense of the term, vestiges of past segregation by\n     state decree do remain in our society and in our schools....\n\f     [as a stubborn fact of history, we must not] overstate its\n     consequences in fixing legal responsibilities....      It is\n     simply not always the case that demographic forces causing\n     population change bear any real and substantial relation to a\n     de jure violation[,] [a]nd the law need not proceed on that\n     premise.\n\nId. at 495-96, 112 S.Ct. at 1448.              Further, \"[a]s the          de jure\n\nviolation becomes more remote in time and ... demographic changes\n\nintervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance\n\nin a school district is a vestige of the prior de jure system.                   The\n\ncausal link between current conditions and the prior violation is\n\neven more attenuated if the school district has demonstrated its\n\ngood faith [commitment to a desegregation plan.]\"                  Id. at 496, 112\n\nS.Ct. at 1448.\n\n       A    good    faith   commitment    to    a   desegregation        plan   also\n\ndemonstrates to parents, students, and the public that students\n\nwill no longer suffer injury or stigma.                   At the same time, it\n\n\"enables    the     district   court     to    accept      the    school   board's\n\nrepresentation that [the school board] has accepted the principle\n\nof racial equality and will not suffer intentional discrimination\n\nin the future.\"      Id. at 498, 112 S.Ct. at 1449.              To determine if a\n\nschool board has shown a good faith commitment to a desegregation\n\nplan, a district court should, among other things, consider whether\n\nthe school board's policies \"form a consistent pattern of lawful\n\nconduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.\"                    Id. at 491,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 1446.\n\n     Here, the district court concluded that the school board has\n\nin   good   faith     shown    a   commitment       to,   and     has   fully    and\n\nsatisfactorily complied with, the desegregation plan generally and\n\nin those aspects specifically related to student assignments.                    The\n\fdistrict court, which has monitored the actions of the school board\n\nfor   over   30   years,   reached   this   conclusion   based   on   several\n\nfindings.     First, it found that it has never had to enjoin or\n\nsanction the school board.      Second, it found that the school board\n\nnever failed to comply with a court order.2         Third, it found that\n\nthe school board took actions to further desegregation which went\n\nabove and beyond what the 1971 order as amended required.             Fourth,\n\nit found that the school board kept desegregation of its schools at\n\na level not surpassed by any school district in the country for ten\n\nyears, even in the face of countervailing demographic factors.\n\nFifth, it found that the school board implemented magnet programs\n\nwhich, at least in one instance, helped to racially balance an\n\notherwise unbalanced school. Sixth, it found that the school board\n\nadopted the neighborhood assignment plan only after listening to\n\nthe views of black and white citizens (both groups favored the\n\nplan) and PTA representatives from majority white and majority\n\nblack schools (both groups opposed an alternative plan).3 Seventh,\n\n      2\n      As part of this finding, the district court interpreted its\n1971 order as amended to require the school district only to\nachieve proportionate representation for the 1972-73 school year.\nWe should give effect to that interpretation.

July 21, 1994), we affirmed the district\ncourt's decision allowing the school district to continue the\nplan as consistent with the underlying desegregation plan.

(R2-40).   In addition to\n\nthese specific findings, the district court noted generally that\n\n\"[e]very expert who testified in this case expressed praise in\n\nvarying degrees for the desegregation efforts of the [school\n\nboard].\"     (R. 2-55.)    The district court's findings were based on\n\nuncontradicted evidence and fully support the district court's\n\nconclusion that the school board has shown a good faith commitment\n\nto and compliance with the desegregation plan.

The district court\n\ndetermined that the racial imbalances were not caused by the school\n\n     1\n      In its Petition for Rehearing, the School Board repeatedly\nsuggests that a school district satisfies its obligations once it\nadopts a racially neutral system of student assignment. See\nPetition for Rehearing at 7 (\"federal courts simply have no\nauthority to enforce orders solely to achieve racial balance once\na racially neutral system of student assignment has effectively\nbeen adopted\") & 12 (\"there is no affirmative duty [to remedy\nracial imbalances] after a school system has successfully\nimplemented a school desegregation plan\"). However, I believe\nPetitioner confuses the means of its remedial obligations with\nthe ends. Although implementing a racially neutral attendance\npattern is a necessary remedial device, \"[a] remedy is\njustifiable only insofar as it advances the ultimate objective of\nalleviating the initial constitutional violation.\" Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 489, 112 S.Ct. at 1445 (emphasis added).\n\fsystem but, in doing so, focused only on demographic changes in the\n\ncounty.   The court failed to consider whether the school board's\n\ntotal curtailment of any desegregation efforts after about 1980\n\nhelped    preserve   or   perpetuate   the   effects   of   its   prior\n\nunconstitutional policies.     The district court's narrow approach\n\nerroneously assumed that as long as a school district can point to\n\nsome force not directly related to a school district's overt\n\nactions which is causing or exacerbating racial imbalances, then\n\nthe resulting imbalance is not traceable to past practices.       I do\n\nnot believe that this approach comports with the proper burdens of\n\nproof or the analytic framework set out in Freeman v.
