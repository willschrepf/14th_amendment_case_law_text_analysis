Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    Bernardo Figueroa on brief pro se.\n    Michael B. Grant on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                       December 9, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.             In this appeal, Rhode Island state\n\ninmate Bernardo Figueroa, proceeding pro se, appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action\n\nagainst     Joseph        DiNitto,         Associate       Director/Chief        of\n\nClassification at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections\n\n(\"RIDOC\").       We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings, as described below.\n\n             1.    We agree with the district court that summary\n\njudgment     in    DiNitto's         favor      was   warranted     relative     to\n\nFigueroa's       retaliation        claim,      essentially   for    the   reasons\n\nstated by the magistrate judge in his report and recommendation\n\ndated March 14, 2002, which the district court accepted in an\n\norder dated March 29, 2002.\n\n             2. We conclude that Figueroa has waived his right to\n\nquestion the dismissal of his court access claim. See Sands v.\n\nRidefilm Corp., 212 F.3d 657, 663 (1st Cir. 2000) (indicating\n\nthat failure to object to a magistrate judge's ruling waives\n\nthe right to appellate consideration).\n\n             3. We affirm dismissal of the Eighth Amendment claim\n\ninsofar     as    it    is    based       on    Figueroa's    transfer     to    and\n\nconfinement       at    Powhatan      Correctional        Center    in   Virginia.\n\nDiNitto has liability only if he knew of the allegedly harmful\n\nconditions at that facility.                   See Calderon-Ortiz v. Laboy-\n\nAlvarado,    300       F.3d   60,    64    (1st    Cir.   2002)    (in   order   to\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\festablish    a     prison     official's         deliberate         indifference,       a\n\nplaintiff    must     show:     \"(1)   the        defendant         knew    of    (2)   a\n\nsubstantial risk (3) of serious harm and (4) disregarded that\n\nrisk\") (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994)).                            There\n\nis no allegation in the complaint from which we can infer such\n\nknowledge.\n\n             4.    We affirm the dismissal of the Eighth Amendment\n\nclaim to the extent it is based on Figueroa's general living\n\nconditions at Wallens Ridge State Prison in Virginia. Figueroa\n\nalleged that he had not committed disciplinary infractions\n\nwhile imprisoned in that state, but nonetheless was confined to\n\na cell with another prisoner for 23-24 hours a day, without any\n\nopportunity to work or participate in educational, vocational,\n\nor   rehabilitation       programs,        and    that       he    had    been    denied\n\nmedical, dental, and mental health care.                          The medical claim,\n\nbeing completely conclusory, was properly dismissed.                                 The\n\nremaining conditions of confinement, even viewed in totality,\n\nfail to establish the kind of \"extreme deprivation\" that might\n\nviolate     the     Eighth     Amendment.              See    In     re    Long     Term\n\nAdministrative       Segregation       of    Inmates         Designated       as    Five\n\nPercenters, 174 F.3d 464, 471-72 (4th Cir.) (rejecting Eighth\n\nAmendment         claim     where,     due        to     their           high-security\n\nclassification, inmates spent 23 hours a day isolated in their\n\ncells   without       radio    or    TV;     left      only        for    showers    and\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\frecreation, including 5 hours of exercise per week; and had no\n\naccess to prison work, school, or study programs), cert.denied\n\nsub nom. Mickle v. Moore, 528 U.S. 874 (1999); Hudson v.\n\nMcMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9 (1992) (holding that only \"extreme\n\ndeprivations\" would support an Eighth Amendment claim based on\n\nconditions of confinement because \"routine discomfort\" is part\n\nof   the   penalty    inmates      pay   for   their   crimes)     (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            5. We vacate dismissal of the Eighth Amendment claim\n\ninsofar as it is based on the actions of guards at Wallens\n\nRidge State Prison.      For present purposes, we assume that the\n\nfollowing facts alleged in the complaint are true:\n\n            In March 2000, Figueroa was transferred from the\n\nPowhatan Correctional Center to Wallens Ridge, a super-maximum\n\nfacility also located in Virginia.             Upon arrival, correctional\n\nofficers \"repeatedly and unnecessarily restrained . . . and\n\nthreatened    [him]    with     injury     from   electroshock      weapons,\n\nchemical weapons, shot-guns, and police dogs[.]\"              On June 27,\n\n2000,   Figueroa     wrote    to   DiNitto,     explaining   his   \"serious\n\nproblems\" in Virginia and asking to be returned to Rhode\n\nIsland.     Further correspondence followed, but the outcome was\n\nthat DiNitto declined to intervene. Figueroa also alleged that\n\nDiNitto was deliberately indifferent to the risk that he had\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f  and will \"continue to suffer serious physical injury or death\n\n  at the hands of Virginia prison guards.\"1\n\n              In   the   district   court,   DiNitto    contended     that\n\n  Virginia,   rather     than   Rhode   Island,   was   responsible   for\n\n  conditions at Wallens Ridge and that Figueroa's only recourse\n\n  was against Virginia prison authorities.          The district court\n\n  seemingly agreed, although its rationale was tersely expressed.\n\n              In our view, this ground of disposition is not\n\n  adequate.    Figueroa's Rhode Island conviction gave this state\n\n  custody over him until he was legally discharged or had served\n\n  his sentence, see R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-25-17; id. § 12-19-25,\n\n  and it is Rhode Island that has arranged for Figueroa to serve\n\n  a portion of his sentence in Virginia.          If Figueroa is being\n\n  subjected to unconstitutional conditions in Virginia on a\n\n  continuing basis and Rhode Island knows of these conditions but\n\n  refuses to relocate Figueroa, Rhode Island officials might\n\n  (depending upon the circumstances) be held responsible.              See\n\n  Cortes-Quinones v. Jimenez-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556, 562 (1st\n\n  Cir. 1988); Stewart v. Winter, 669 F.2d 328, 332 (5th Cir.\n\n  1982); Benjamin v. Malcolm, 803 F.2d 46, 51 (2d Cir. 1986);\n\n\n\n     1\n      The latter statement is located in the section of the\ncomplaint laying out his legal claims, not in the section\ndescribing the factual basis of the complaint.     It is far from\nclear that this is intended to be a factual allegation rather than\na summary of the standard of liability taken from judicial\nopinions.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fPinto v. Nettleship, 737 F.2d 130, 131, 133 n.1 (1st Cir.\n\n1984).\n\n          Accordingly, this claim must be remanded for further\n\nconsideration.         At the same time, we recognize that Figueroa\n\nhas offered only marginally defensible allegations.                 Guns,\n\nchemical spray and even guard dogs are employed at prisons; and\n\nconclusory        or     unspecific         references    to   \"threats,\"\n\n\"unreasonable\" behavior by guards, and unspecified physical or\n\nmental harm may be viewed with some skepticism, especially when\n\nburied in a \"kitchen sink\" complaint.              The district court is\n\nentitled to make Figueroa specify in detail the underlying\n\nfactual allegations before proceeding with this claim.\n\n             To   the    extent   described      above,   we   vacate   the\n\ndismissal of the Eighth Amendment claim and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n             The judgment is affirmed in part, vacated in part,\n\nand remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",

At the same time, we recognize that Figueroa\n\nhas offered only marginally defensible allegations.                 Guns,\n\nchemical spray and even guard dogs are employed at prisons; and\n\nconclusory        or     unspecific         references    to   \"threats,\"\n\n\"unreasonable\" behavior by guards, and unspecified physical or\n\nmental harm may be viewed with some skepticism, especially when\n\nburied in a \"kitchen sink\" complaint.              The district court is\n\nentitled to make Figueroa specify in detail the underlying\n\nfactual allegations before proceeding with this claim.\n\n             To   the    extent   described      above,   we   vacate   the\n\ndismissal of the Eighth Amendment claim and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n             The judgment is affirmed in part, vacated in part,\n\nand remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f</pre>",
