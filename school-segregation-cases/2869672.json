Higgins appeals from the dismissal of his\nfederal civil rights claim that Howard L. Beyer, the\nAssistant Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections, and 13 employees of the Adult Diagnostic and\nTreatment Center (\"ADTC employees\") violated 38 U.S.C.\nS 5301(a) by seizing money derived from a veteran’s\ndisability benefits check from his inmate account to pay a\nstate court-ordered fine, and that he was deprived of his\nconstitutional right to due process because his request for\na predeprivation hearing was ignored. He also seeks\nreversal of the dismissal of his claim, on the ground of\nmootness, that prison employees retaliated against him for\nexercising constitutionally protected rights.\n\nWe reverse because we conclude that Higgins’s pro se\ncomplaint, when liberally construed, stated sufficient facts\nto state a cause of action for a violation of a federal right\nunder S 5301(a), and a deprivation of his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to notice and hearing prior to the\n\n                                2\n\n\ndeprivation of his property interest in the proceeds of his\nveteran’s benefits. We also hold that the district court erred\nin dismissing his claim that the prison officials retaliated\nagainst him for asserting his rights under the Due Process\nClause.\n\nI\n\nHiggins alleged the following facts in his complaint.\nHiggins served in the United States Army from 1974 to\n1978. While in the Army, Higgins injured his left hand,\nleaving him partially disabled. This partial disability\nqualified Higgins to receive disability benefits from the\nVeteran’s Administration (\"VA\") for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1992, Higgins pled guilty to the crime of First Degree\nAggravated Sexual Assault in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The court sentenced Higgins to a 10-year term of\nimprisonment to be served at the ADTC in Avenel, New\nJersey. The court also imposed a Victims of Crime\nCompensation Board (\"VCCB\") fine in the amount of\n$1,000, pursuant to section 2C:43-31 of the New Jersey\nStatutes Annotated. N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1 (West\n1995). Section 2C:43-3.1 expressly requires a New Jersey\nSuperior Court to order the Department of Corrections to\ncollect a VCCB fine from the personal account of an inmate\nif the assessment was not paid at the time of sentencing.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Section 2C:43-3.1 provides in pertinent part:\n\n       In addition to any disposition made pursuant to the provisions of\n       N.J.S. 2C:43-2, any person convicted of a crime of violence . . . shall\n       be assessed at least $100.00, but not to exceed $10,000.00 for each\n\f       such crime for which he was convicted which resulted in the injury\n       or death of another person. . . . When a defendant who is sentenced\n       to incarceration in a State correctional facility has not, at the time\n       of sentencing, paid an assessment for the crime for which he is\n       being sentenced or an assessment imposed for a previous crime, the\n       court shall specifically order the Department of Corrections to collect\n       the assessment during the period of incarceration and to deduct the\n       assessment from . . . any personal account established in the\n       institution for the benefit of the inmate.\n\nN.J. Stat. Ann S 2C:43-3.1(a)(1), (a)(3).\n\n                                3\n\n\nAt the time of sentencing, Higgins had not yet received any\ndisability benefits from the VA.\n\nOn April 7, 1993, Higgins was transferred from the\nMonmouth County Correctional Center Facility to the\nADTC. On or about April 1, 1998, he received a notification\nfrom the VA that his claim for benefits for partial disability\nhad been approved. He was advised that he would receive\na check for benefits due from January 1, 1991 to March 31,\n1998.\n\nOn May 29, 1998, a United States Treasury Department\ncheck in the amount of $7,608, made out to Higgins as the\npayee, arrived at the ADTC. On the same date, Higgins was\nnotified during mail call by an ADTC employee that the\ncheck had arrived. He was not handed the check nor did he\nauthorize any prison employee to deposit it in his inmate\naccount. The standard procedure at the ADTC when a\ncheck is received is to request the inmate to sign a form\nacknowledging receipt of the check and then endorse it \"For\nDeposit Only.\" The ADTC employees did not follow this\nprocedure.\n\nLater that day, Higgins wrote four \"business remits,\"\nwhich instructed prison employees to forward money in the\namounts of $5,000, $2,000, and two for $200 apiece to\nvarious persons. A \"business remit\" is the term used at the\nADTC for an inmate’s authorization that money be\ndeducted from his account.\n\nOn May 31, 1998, Higgins asked the social worker\nassigned to his wing to find out what had happened to his\ncheck. The social worker informed Higgins that ADTC\nemployees intended to use part of the proceeds of the VA\ndisability benefits check to pay the outstanding VCCB fine\nordered by the New Jersey Superior Court. On the same\ndate, Higgins filed a written complaint addressed to ADTC\nSuperintendent William F. Plantier in which Higgins stated\nthat a VA disability benefits check is not attachable\npursuant to 38 U.S.C. S 5301.\n\nOn June 2, 1998, ADTC Assistant Superintendent Grace\nRogers sent a letter to Higgins in which she stated that\nHiggins’s VA disability benefits check had been received\nand would be deposited in his inmate account. On June 3,\n\f                                4\n\n\n1998, Higgins received written confirmation that his check\nhad been deposited in his inmate account. On June 9,\n1998, Linda Cook, an ADTC social worker, notified Higgins\nthat none of the checks that he had authorized would be\nsent out until he signed a business remit authorizing the\nwithdrawal of $1,000 to pay the VCCB fine. Higgins refused\non the ground that a VA disability benefits check is not\nattachable pursuant to 38 U.S.C. S 5301. He also stated\nthat under the terms of his plea bargain, he was only\nrequired to pay an assessment of $30 and that he had filed\na habeas corpus petition challenging the imposition of a\nVCCB fine in the amount of $1,000. Ms. Cook informed\nHiggins that only a portion of the checks he had authorized\nwould be sent out so that there would be sufficient funds\nin his inmate account to satisfy the VCCB fine.\n\nOn June 10, 1998, Daniel Barrajas, ADTC’s Assistant\nMail Supervisor, asked Higgins to endorse the VA disability\nbenefits check. Higgins refused. On the same date, Higgins\nwrote to Superintendent Plantier requesting a written\nexplanation of the disposition of his VA disability benefits\ncheck. Higgins also stated that if he did not receive a\nwritten explanation by June 12, 1998, he would file an\naction in the United States District Court. Superintendent\nPlantier did not reply. Sometime thereafter, ADTC\nemployees deducted $1,000 from Higgins’s inmate account\nto pay the VCCB fine ordered by the New Jersey Superior\nCourt.\n\nII\n\nHiggins filed this S 1983 action on August 4, 1998. Prior\nto filing an answer, the ADTC employees moved to dismiss\nthe complaint on October 14, 1998, pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting\nthat Higgins had failed to state a claim upon which relief\ncan be granted. Higgins filed his opposition to the Rule\n12(b)(6) motion on November 9, 1998.\n\nWhile the motion to dismiss was pending, Higgins filed a\npro se pleading styled as a \"NOTICE OF MOTION IN\nSUPPORT OF AFFIDAVIT/DEPOSITION TO CONSOLIDATE\nTHESE ARGUMENTS WITH THE ABOVE DOCKET CASE\n\n                                5\n\n\nAND/OR ORDER OF PROTECTION/INJUNCTION.\" In this\nmotion, Higgins alleged that ADTC employees brought false\ncharges against him, resulting in his confinement in\nadministrative segregation for 365 days and the denial of\nhis access to the courts, in retaliation for the filing of this\naction for damages for the deprivation of his rights\npursuant to 38 U.S.C. S 5301(a) and the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\fOn June 10, 1999, without the benefit of oral argument,\nthe district court granted the ADTC employees’ motion to\ndismiss this action, for failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted. In a footnote to its memorandum\nopinion, the district court stated: \"In light of this Court’s\ngranting of the motion to dismiss plaintiff ’s complaint as to\nthe fourteen individual defendants, the later-filed motion of\npro se plaintiff Vincent Higgins for a preliminary injunction\nshall be denied as moot.\" The court did not explain how\nHiggins’s discrete claim that ADTC employees retaliated\nagainst him for asserting his right to access to the courts\nwas rendered moot by his alleged failure to state a claim for\nthe deprivation of his property in violation ofS 5301(a) and\nhis constitutional right to a predeprivation hearing.\n\nHiggins has timely appealed the district court’s final\njudgment in this S 1983 action. Accordingly, we have\njurisdiction over this appeal. 28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nIII\n\nHiggins contends that the district court erred in ruling\nthat he failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that\nthe ADTC employees violated S 1983. He argues that the\ncomplaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim under\nS 1983 either for depriving him of money derived from a VA\ndisability benefits check in violation of S 5301(a), or for\ndenying him his constitutional right to a predeprivation\nhearing to challenge the threat to remove funds derived\nfrom his VA disability benefits check from his inmate\naccount.\n\nOur review of the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) is plenary. Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir.\n\n                                6\n\n\n1996). This Court has described the nature of our review as\nfollows:\n\n       We must determine whether, under any reasonable\n       reading of the pleadings, the plaintiffs may be entitled\n       to relief, and we must accept as true the factual\n       allegations in the complaint and all reasonable\n       inferences that can be drawn therefrom. The complaint\n       will be deemed to have alleged sufficient facts if it\n       adequately put the defendants on notice of the\n       essential elements of the plaintiffs’ cause of action.\n       Since this is a S 1983 action, the plaintiffs are entitled\n       to relief if their complaint sufficiently alleges\n       deprivation of any right secured by the Constitution. In\n       considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we do not inquire\n       whether the plaintiffs will ultimately prevail, only\n       whether they are entitled to offer evidence to support\n       their claims. Thus, the district court’s order granting\n       the defendants’ motion to dismiss will be affirmed only\n       if it appears that the plaintiffs could prove no set of\n       facts that would entitle them to relief.\n\fId. (citations omitted). Moreover, as Higgins filed his\ncomplaint pro se, we must liberally construe his pleadings,\nand we will \"apply the applicable law, irrespective of\nwhether a pro se litigant has mentioned it by name.\" Holley\nv. Dep’t of Veteran Affairs, 165 F.3d 244, 247-48 (3d Cir.\n1999).\n\nSection 1983 authorizes a person to file a private cause\nof action against state actors for a deprivation of rights\nprotected by a federal statute or the United States\nConstitution. Section 1983 provides in pertinent part:\n\n       Every person who, under color of any statute,\n       ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\n       or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or\n       causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States\n       or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the\n       deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\n       secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to\n       the party injured in an action at law, suite in equity, or\n       other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\n\n                                7\n\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1983. It is undisputed that the ADTC\nemployees were state actors who deprived Higgins of funds\nderived from his VA disability benefits check without his\nconsent under color of a state court order issued pursuant\nto N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(3).\n\nA.\n\nWe must first consider whether Higgins alleged sufficient\nfacts to demonstrate a violation of 38 U.S.C. S 5301(a).\nSection 5301(a) provides in relevant part:\n\n       Payments of benefits due or to become due under any\n       law administered by the Secretary shall not be\n       assignable except to the extent specifically authorized\n       by law, and such payments made to, or on account of,\n       a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation, shall be\n       exempt from the claim of creditors, and shall not be\n       liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any\n       legal or equitable process whatever, either before or\n       after receipt by the beneficiary. The preceding sentence\n       shall not apply to claims of the United States arising\n       under such laws nor shall the exemption therein\n       contained as to taxation extend to any property\n       purchased in part or wholly out of such payments.\n       . . .\n\n38 U.S.C. S 5301(a).\n\nIn order to state a claim under S 1983, a plaintiff must\nallege a \"violation of a federal right, and not merely a\nviolation of federal law.\" Pa. Pharmacists Ass’n v. Houstoun,\n283 F.3d 531, 535 (3d Cir. 2002) (en banc) (quotation\nomitted). This Court recently explained that \"a plaintiff\nalleging a violation of a federal statute may not proceed\n\funder S 1983 unless 1) the statute creates enforceable\nrights, privileges, or immunities within the meaning of\nS 1983 and 2) Congress has not foreclosed such\nenforcement of the statute in the enactment itself.\" Id.\n(quotations omitted).\n\nTo create a right enforceable under S 1983, the federal\nstatute at issue must meet three conditions:\n\n                                8\n\n\n       First, Congress must have intended that the provision\n       in question benefit the plaintiff. Second, the plaintiff\n       must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected\n       by the statute is not so \"vague and amorphous\" that its\n       enforcement would strain judicial competence. Third,\n       the statute must unambiguously impose a binding\n       obligation on the States. In other words, the provision\n       giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in\n       mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.\n\nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-41 (1997)\n(citations omitted). Once all three conditions are met, a\nrebuttable presumption arises that the right is enforceable\nunder S 1983. Id. at 341; Pa. Pharmacists Ass’n, 283 F.3d\nat 535. \"This presumption may be rebutted by showing that\nCongress expressly or impliedly foreclosed an action under\nS 1983.\" Pa. Pharmacists Ass’n, 283 F.3d at 535.\n\nCongress may impliedly foreclose a remedy underS 1983\n\"by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is\nincompatible with individual enforcement under S 1983.\"\nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 341. Section 5301(a) contains neither\nexpress language nor a comprehensive enforcement scheme\nthat demonstrates that Congress intended to foreclose a\nremedy under S 1983 for a violation of S 5301(a). We are\npersuaded that S 5301(a) provides a federal right that is\nenforceable under S 1983.\n\nThe purpose of the prohibition against the attachment,\nlevy, or seizure of a veteran’s disability benefits in S 5301(a)\nis to \"prevent the deprivation and depletion of the means of\nsubsistence of veterans dependent upon these benefits as\nthe main source of their income.\" Rose v. Rose, 481 U.S.\n619, 630 (1987) (quotation omitted). Even though Higgins,\nbecause he is a prisoner, does not presently need or rely\nupon his disability benefits for subsistence, his right\nnonetheless to receive those benefits free from attachment,\nlevy, or seizure is expressly set forth in clear, mandatory\nlanguage in the statute. Section 5301(a) also precludes\nanyone from using any \"legal or equitable process\" to\nattach, levy, or seize these benefits. Thus, S 5301(a)\nsatisfies the conditions set forth in Blessing v. Freestone for\ncreating a federal right enforceable under S 1983.\n\n                                9\n\n\nOur holding that a violation of a veteran’s rights under\n\fS 5301(a) is enforceable against state prison officials\npursuant to S 1983 is supported by the Ninth Circuit’s\ndecision in Nelson v. Heiss, 271 F.3d 891 (9th Cir. 2001).\nIn Nelson, the court held that future veteran’s benefits are\nexempt from a hold placed on an inmate’s account where\nthe inmate consented to and the prison officials authorized\nthe hold to cover purchases of medical-record copies and\ndental appliances when there were insufficient funds to\ncover the overdrafts. Id. at 893-96. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat the holds placed on the veteran’s inmate account by\nthe prison officials violated S 5301(a) because a veteran’s\nbenefits are exempt from assignment, attachment, levy, or\nseizure. Id. In Nelson, the state actors were attempting to\nrecoup funds advanced for the veteran’s medical needs. Id.\nat 893. In rejecting the contention of the state actors that\nthey had a right to the funds after providing overdraft\nprotection, the Ninth Circuit reasoned: \"Section 5301(a) was\ndesigned to protect veteran’s benefits against their creditors\nso that the veterans themselves could spend those funds as\nthey saw fit when they actually got them, and not before.\"\nId. at 894.\n\nIn response to the prison officials’ argument that\nCongress could not have intended to prohibit the taking of\na veteran’s disability benefits for his or her maintenance\nand care as allowed by a number of states, the Ninth\nCircuit observed: \"But if Congress wanted to create\nexceptions to [non-attachment or seizure], it knew how to\ndo so.\" Id. at 896. In Nelson, the Ninth Circuit applied\nS 5301(a), notwithstanding the fact that the prisoner had\nspecifically consented to the future payment for the goods\nand services from his account when he received a VA check\nthat would cover his depleted inmate account. Id. at 895.\n\nIn this matter, Higgins did not consent to the taking of\nmoney from his inmate account. Instead, he warned the\nADTC employees that the use of his disability benefits to\nsatisfy the VCCB fine violated S 5301(a). Thus, the matter\nbefore us presents a more compelling factual basis for\napplying S 5301(a) to protect money derived from Higgins’s\ndisability benefits from attachment, levy, or seizure than\nthe circumstances before the Ninth Circuit in Nelson.\n\n                                10\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet construed S 5301(a) to\ndetermine whether prison officials can attach or seize funds\nin an inmate’s account derived from a VA disability benefits\ncheck. In Bennett v. Arkansas, 485 U.S. 395 (1988), the\nCourt was called upon to determine whether a State can\nattach Social Security benefits to help defray the cost of\nmaintaining its prison system. Id. at 396. The State of\nArkansas filed an action in state court seeking to attach\nBennett’s Social Security benefits to defray the cost of\nmaintaining its prison system pursuant to the State Prison\nInmate Care and Custody Reimbursement Act, Ark. Stat.\nAnn. S 46-1701 et seq. (Supp. 1985). Id. The Arkansas\nstatute expressly authorized the seizure of federal Social\nSecurity benefits for this purpose. Id. at 396 n.1.\n\fIn his opposition to the State’s action, Bennett argued\nthat the Arkansas statute violated the Supremacy Clause\nbecause it was in conflict with 42 U.S.C. S 407(a), which\nexempts Social Security benefits \"from legal process.\" Id. at\n397. Section 407(a) provides in relevant part that\"none of\nthe moneys paid or payable . . . under [the Social Security\nAct] shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment,\ngarnishment, or other legal process.\" 42 U.S.C.S 407(a).\nThe state trial court entered judgment in favor of the State\nand directed that a portion of Bennett’s Social Security\nbenefits be seized. 485 U.S. at 397. The Supreme Court of\nArkansas affirmed, holding that there was no conflict\nbetween the Arkansas statute and 42 U.S.C. S 407(a)\nbecause \" ‘the [Social Security Act] contain[s] an implied\nexception to the exemption from legal process when the\nState provides for the care and maintenance of a\nbeneficiary of social security . . . funds.’ \" Id. at 397 (quoting\nBennett v. State, 716 S.W.2d 755, 756 (Ark. 1986)).\n\nThe Court granted Bennett’s petition for certiorari and\nreversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.\nId. at 397-98. The Court reasoned as follows:\n\n       We think--contrary to the conclusion of the Supreme\n       Court of Arkansas--that there is a clear inconsistency\n       between the Arkansas statute and 42 U.S.C. S 407(a)\n       (1982 ed., Supp. III). Section 407(a) unambiguously\n       rules out any attempt to attach Social Security\n       benefits. The Arkansas statute just as unambiguously\n\n                                11\n\n\n       allows the State to attach those benefits. As we see it,\n       this amounts to a \"conflict\" under the Supremacy\n       Clause--a conflict that the State cannot win.\n\nId. at 397.\n\nWe recognize that the language used by Congress in\nprotecting Social Security benefits in S 407(a) is not\nprecisely the same as the words it employed in S 5301(a)\nregarding the attachment or seizure of a veteran’s disability\nbenefits. We agree with the Ninth Circuit, however, that \"its\nreach is essentially the same.\" Nelson, 271 F.3d at 895.\n\nWe next turn to the question whether the New Jersey\nstatutes are preempted under the Supremacy Clause\nbecause they are inconsistent with S 5301(a). The ADTC\nemployees argue that the doctrine of preemption is not\napplicable on several grounds. They first maintain that\nthere is no conflict between N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1 and\nS 5301(a). They assert that S 5301(a) is inapplicable because\nthe VCCB is not Higgins’s creditor and the deduction from\nhis inmate account was not accomplished by an\nattachment, levy, or seizure under legal or equitable\nprocess. We disagree. This contention ignores the\nunambiguous intent of the New Jersey legislature in\nenacting the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act of 1971\n\f(\"CICA\"). See N.J. Stat. Ann. S 52:4B-1 et seq. (West 2001).\nThe CICA created the Violent Crimes Compensation Board.\nId. S 52:4B-3.2 Under the provisions of the CICA, the VCCB\nmay order the payment of compensation for personal\ninjuries suffered by the victim of an aggravated sexual\nassault. Id. SS 52:4B-2; 52:4B-11(b)(9).\n\nSection 2C:43-3.1 provides for the collection of funds for\nthe VCCB through court-ordered fines assessed against\npersons convicted of a crime of violence which resulted in\nthe injury of another person. The imposition of the VCCB\nassessment is mandatory. Id. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(1). As noted\nabove, if the assessment is not paid at the time of\nsentencing, the court must order the Department of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The name of the Violent Crimes Compensation Board was changed in\n1995 to the Victims of Crime Compensation Board. N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 52:4B-3.1.\n\n                                12\n\n\nCorrections to collect the assessment during the period of\nincarceration by deducting funds from the defendant’s\ninmate account. Id. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(3). Under such\ncircumstances, employees of the Department of Corrections\nare required to forward the amount collected to the VCCB.\nId.\n\nThe ADTC employees rely on the Fifth Circuit’s decision\nin Department of Health & Rehabilitative Services v. Davis,\n616 F.2d 828 (5th Cir. 1980), in support of their\nproposition that the VCCB is not a creditor within the\nmeaning of S 5301(a). Their reliance on Davis is misplaced.\nIn Davis, the Florida Department of Health and\nRehabilitative Services filed an action seeking an order\ngranting it reimbursement of $12,000 for the care and\nmaintenance of an incompetent in the Florida State\nHospital. Id. at 829. During the years that the incompetent\nwas hospitalized, his guardian accumulated $40,000 in\nSocial Security and veteran’s benefits. Id. His guardian\nrefused to reimburse the Florida Department of Health and\nRehabilitative Services on the basis that the moneys\nreceived from federal Social Security and veteran’s benefits\nstatutes were exempt from a creditor’s claims. Id. The\ndistrict court denied relief. Id. The Fifth Circuit reversed. Id.\nIt concluded that since the purpose of each federal statute\nwas to provide for the care and maintenance of its\nbeneficiaries, it was consistent with that goal to reimburse\na state agency that provided for an incompetent person’s\ncare and maintenance. Id. at 831-32.\n\nIn the matter sub judice, the intent of the New Jersey\nLegislature in enacting the CICA was not aimed at\nproviding for the care and maintenance of persons\nconvicted of violent crimes. The CICA’s purpose is to\ncompensate victims of violent crimes for their injuries.\nMoreover, subsequent to Davis, the Supreme Court\nrejected, in the context of Social Security benefits, the very\n\fargument the state made in Davis. Bennett, 485 U.S. at\n397-98. As we have explained, the Supreme Court\ninterpreted the language of 42 U.S.C. S 407(a) as barring\nArkansas from retaining an inmate’s Social Security\nbenefits, regardless of its purpose in doing so. The very\nsimilar mandatory and all-inclusive language ofS 5301(a)\nrequires the same conclusion here.\n\n                                13\n\n\nA creditor is a person or entity to whom a debt is owed.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 375 (7th ed. 1999). A debtor is a\nperson who owes an obligation to another. Id. at 411.\nPursuant to the CICA, a court must order a person\nconvicted of a violent crime to pay an assessment to the\nVCCB. N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(1). The judgment is\nenforceable by requiring employees of the New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections to seize the amount owing to the\nVCCB from the inmate’s account. Id. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(3).\nThus, contrary to the position of the ADTC employees, the\nVCCB is a creditor within the meaning of S 5301(a). The\nCICA has created a creditor-debtor relationship between a\nperson convicted of the crime of aggravated sexual assault\nand the VCCB that is enforceable by a court order.\n\nThe ADTC employees also maintain that the deduction of\nfunds derived from Higgins’s VA disability benefits check\ndid not violate S 5301(a) because it was not effected by\nattachment, levy, seizure by or under any legal or equitable\nprocess. As discussed above, the CICA requires a New\nJersey court to \"specifically order the Department of\nCorrections to collect the assessment during the period of\nincarceration and to deduct the assessment . . . from any\npersonal account established in the institution for the\nbenefit of the inmate.\" N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1. The\nterm \"levy\" is defined as the seizure of property to satisfy a\njudgment. Black’s Law Dictionary, supra, at 919. We are\npersuaded that the collection of funds from Higgins’s\ninmate account by the ADTC employees was clearly a levy\nor a seizure required by New Jersey law.\n\nThe ADTC employees further assert that N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 2C:43-3.1(a)(3) does not conflict with S 5301(a) because\nNew Jersey law \"mandates the care, government and\nmaintenance of inmates by the Commissioner of the\nDepartment of Corrections, thereby fulfilling the\nCongressional intent of 38 U.S.C. S 5301(a).\" Appellees Br.\nat 19-20. The Supreme Court rejected a similar argument\nin Bennett. There, the Court noted thatS 407(a) of the\nSocial Security Act does not contain \"an ‘implied exception’\nthat would allow attachment of otherwise exempted federal\npayments simply because the State has provided the\nrecipient with ‘care and maintenance.’ \" 485 U.S. at 397.\n\n                                14\n\n\nLikewise, S 5301(a) does not contain an implied exception\nwhich would allow the collection of funds derived from a VA\n\fdisability benefits check to compensate his or her crime\nvictim merely because New Jersey law requires the\nDepartment of Corrections to provide for an inmate’s care\nand maintenance.\n\nAs noted previously, Congress’s purpose in enacting\nS 5301(a) was to \"prevent the deprivation and depletion of\nthe means of subsistence of veterans dependent upon these\nbenefits as the main source of their income.\" Rose, 481\nU.S. at 630. Section 2C:43-3.1(a)(3) expressly allows the\ndeduction of any funds located in an inmate’s personal\naccount. To the extent this statute allows the deduction of\nfunds derived from a VA disability benefits check, its\nprovisions conflict with S 5301(a). \"A state law is in conflict,\nand void under the supremacy clause, if it stands as an\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\npurposes and objective of Congress.\" Finberg v. Sullivan,\n634 F.2d 50, 63 (3d Cir. 1980) (en banc) (quotation\nomitted). To the extent N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(3)\nauthorizes prison officials to deduct funds derived from a\nprisoner’s VA disability benefits check, it conflicts with the\npurpose and objectives of Congress in enacting S 5301(a)\nand is void under the Supremacy Clause.\n\nB.\n\nHiggins also challenges the dismissal of his claim that\nthe ADTC employees took his VA benefits without notice or\na hearing, in violation of his procedural due process rights\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth\nAmendment prohibits the States from depriving \"any person\nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV, S 1. This Court has previously held that\n\"[i]nmates have a property interest in funds held in prison\naccounts. Thus, inmates are entitled to due process with\nrespect to any deprivation of this money.\" Reynolds v.\nWagner, 128 F.3d 166, 179 (3d Cir. 1997) (citations\nomitted). The Supreme Court has explained the\nrequirements of the Due Process Clause as follows:\n\n       In situations where the State feasibly can provide a\n       predeprivation hearing before taking property, it\n\n                                15\n\n\n       generally must do so regardless of the adequacy of a\n       postdeprivation tort remedy to compensate for the\n       taking. Conversely, in situations where a\n       predeprivation hearing is unduly burdensome in\n       proportion to the liberty interest at stake, or where the\n       State is truly unable to anticipate and prevent a\n       random deprivation of a liberty interest,\n       postdeprivation remedies might satisfy due process.\n\nZinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 132 (1990) (citations\nomitted).\n\nHiggins alleged in his complaint that the ADTC\nemployees took money from his inmate account without\n\fproviding him with a predeprivation hearing. The ADTC\nemployees argue that they did not improperly deny Higgins\na predeprivation hearing because the New Jersey Torts\nClaims Act provides Higgins with an adequate\npostdeprivation remedy to seek money damages for the\nseizure of his property. Higgins did not allege facts that\ndemonstrate that his funds were seized as the result of a\nrandom, negligent, or unauthorized act of an ADTC\nemployee. Rather, Higgins alleged that the ADTC employees\nwere acting under the authority of an established state\nprocedure for seizing a prisoner’s funds to satisfy court-\nordered fines. The ADTC employees have argued before this\nCourt that they were acting pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 2C:43-3.1(a)(3) when they deducted funds from Higgins’s\naccount. Thus, under Zinermon, Higgins was entitled to\nnotice and hearing before the ADTC employees deducted\nmoney from his account.\n\nHiggins has alleged sufficient facts to establish that he\nwas entitled to a predeprivation notice and hearing. 3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. We note that the alleged violation of Higgins’s Fourteenth Amendment\nright to due process occurred at the moment he was deprived of his\nproperty interest without notice and a predeprivation hearing (i.e., when\nthe ADTC employees seized the money in his inmate account). Thus,\nHiggins’s procedural due process claim would not be rendered moot even\nif he is ultimately successful in recovering the $1,000 under his\nS 5301(a) claim. In such a situation, Higgins would still be entitled to\nnominal damages on a successful procedural due process claim despite\nthe fact that he may be unable to prove actual injury from the\n\n                                16\n\n\nMoreover, Higgins’s procedural due process rights are\nenforceable under S 1983. See Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 125\n(\"A S 1983 action may be brought for a violation of\nprocedural due process . . . .\"). The district court erred in\ndismissing Higgins’s procedural due process claim under\nRule 12(b)(6).\n\nIV\n\nThe district court did not disclose the basis for the\ndismissal of Higgins’s claim that the ADTC employees\nretaliated against him because he exercised his federal\nconstitutional right to seek access to the courts for an\nadjudication of his claims that he was deprived of his rights\nunder S 5301(a) and the Due Process Clause. A person may\nstate an independent cause of action for retaliation for the\nexercise of his or her right of access to the courts,\nregardless of whether the allegations of a deprivation of\nfederal statutory or constitutional rights are meritorious.\nSee White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 111-12 (3d Cir. 1990)\n(\"Retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected\nrights is itself a violation of rights secured by the\nConstitution actionable under section 1983.\"). The district\ncourt erred in dismissing Higgins’s claim for retaliation for\nthe exercise of his rights under federal law.\n\fConclusion\n\nHiggins’s complaint alleged sufficient facts to support a\nS 1983 claim that he was deprived of his rights under\nS 5301(a) and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Accordingly, we VACATE the dismissal of this\naction. Upon REMAND, the district court is directed to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndeprivation of his property interest in the $1,000. See Carey v. Piphus,\n435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978) (stating that \"[b]ecause the right to procedural\ndue process is ‘absolute’ in the sense that it does not depend upon the\nmerits of a claimant’s substantive assertions, and because of the\nimportance to organized society that procedural due process be\nobserved, we believe that the denial of procedural due process should be\nactionable for nominal damages without proof of actual injury\" (citations\nomitted)).\n\n                                17\n\n\npermit Higgins to amend his complaint so as to attempt to\nallege a S 1983 retaliation claim for the exercise of his\nfederal rights.\n\nCosts are awarded to Higgins.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                18\n\f",

Higgins appeals from the dismissal of his\nfederal civil rights claim that Howard L. Beyer, the\nAssistant Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections, and 13 employees of the Adult Diagnostic and\nTreatment Center (\"ADTC employees\") violated 38 U.S.C.\nS 5301(a) by seizing money derived from a veteran’s\ndisability benefits check from his inmate account to pay a\nstate court-ordered fine, and that he was deprived of his\nconstitutional right to due process because his request for\na predeprivation hearing was ignored. He also seeks\nreversal of the dismissal of his claim, on the ground of\nmootness, that prison employees retaliated against him for\nexercising constitutionally protected rights.\n\nWe reverse because we conclude that Higgins’s pro se\ncomplaint, when liberally construed, stated sufficient facts\nto state a cause of action for a violation of a federal right\nunder S 5301(a), and a deprivation of his Fourteenth\nAmendment right to notice and hearing prior to the\n\n                                2\n\n\ndeprivation of his property interest in the proceeds of his\nveteran’s benefits. We also hold that the district court erred\nin dismissing his claim that the prison officials retaliated\nagainst him for asserting his rights under the Due Process\nClause.\n\nI\n\nHiggins alleged the following facts in his complaint.\nHiggins served in the United States Army from 1974 to\n1978. While in the Army, Higgins injured his left hand,\nleaving him partially disabled. This partial disability\nqualified Higgins to receive disability benefits from the\nVeteran’s Administration (\"VA\") for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1992, Higgins pled guilty to the crime of First Degree\nAggravated Sexual Assault in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The court sentenced Higgins to a 10-year term of\nimprisonment to be served at the ADTC in Avenel, New\nJersey. The court also imposed a Victims of Crime\nCompensation Board (\"VCCB\") fine in the amount of\n$1,000, pursuant to section 2C:43-31 of the New Jersey\nStatutes Annotated. N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1 (West\n1995). Section 2C:43-3.1 expressly requires a New Jersey\nSuperior Court to order the Department of Corrections to\ncollect a VCCB fine from the personal account of an inmate\nif the assessment was not paid at the time of sentencing.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Section 2C:43-3.1 provides in pertinent part:\n\n       In addition to any disposition made pursuant to the provisions of\n       N.J.S. 2C:43-2, any person convicted of a crime of violence . . . shall\n       be assessed at least $100.00, but not to exceed $10,000.00 for each\n\f       such crime for which he was convicted which resulted in the injury\n       or death of another person. . . . When a defendant who is sentenced\n       to incarceration in a State correctional facility has not, at the time\n       of sentencing, paid an assessment for the crime for which he is\n       being sentenced or an assessment imposed for a previous crime, the\n       court shall specifically order the Department of Corrections to collect\n       the assessment during the period of incarceration and to deduct the\n       assessment from . . . any personal account established in the\n       institution for the benefit of the inmate.\n\nN.J. Stat. Ann S 2C:43-3.1(a)(1), (a)(3).\n\n                                3\n\n\nAt the time of sentencing, Higgins had not yet received any\ndisability benefits from the VA.\n\nOn April 7, 1993, Higgins was transferred from the\nMonmouth County Correctional Center Facility to the\nADTC. On or about April 1, 1998, he received a notification\nfrom the VA that his claim for benefits for partial disability\nhad been approved. He was advised that he would receive\na check for benefits due from January 1, 1991 to March 31,\n1998.\n\nOn May 29, 1998, a United States Treasury Department\ncheck in the amount of $7,608, made out to Higgins as the\npayee, arrived at the ADTC. On the same date, Higgins was\nnotified during mail call by an ADTC employee that the\ncheck had arrived. He was not handed the check nor did he\nauthorize any prison employee to deposit it in his inmate\naccount. The standard procedure at the ADTC when a\ncheck is received is to request the inmate to sign a form\nacknowledging receipt of the check and then endorse it \"For\nDeposit Only.\" The ADTC employees did not follow this\nprocedure.\n\nLater that day, Higgins wrote four \"business remits,\"\nwhich instructed prison employees to forward money in the\namounts of $5,000, $2,000, and two for $200 apiece to\nvarious persons. A \"business remit\" is the term used at the\nADTC for an inmate’s authorization that money be\ndeducted from his account.\n\nOn May 31, 1998, Higgins asked the social worker\nassigned to his wing to find out what had happened to his\ncheck. The social worker informed Higgins that ADTC\nemployees intended to use part of the proceeds of the VA\ndisability benefits check to pay the outstanding VCCB fine\nordered by the New Jersey Superior Court. On the same\ndate, Higgins filed a written complaint addressed to ADTC\nSuperintendent William F. Plantier in which Higgins stated\nthat a VA disability benefits check is not attachable\npursuant to 38 U.S.C. S 5301.\n\nOn June 2, 1998, ADTC Assistant Superintendent Grace\nRogers sent a letter to Higgins in which she stated that\nHiggins’s VA disability benefits check had been received\nand would be deposited in his inmate account. On June 3,\n\f                                4\n\n\n1998, Higgins received written confirmation that his check\nhad been deposited in his inmate account. On June 9,\n1998, Linda Cook, an ADTC social worker, notified Higgins\nthat none of the checks that he had authorized would be\nsent out until he signed a business remit authorizing the\nwithdrawal of $1,000 to pay the VCCB fine. Higgins refused\non the ground that a VA disability benefits check is not\nattachable pursuant to 38 U.S.C. S 5301. He also stated\nthat under the terms of his plea bargain, he was only\nrequired to pay an assessment of $30 and that he had filed\na habeas corpus petition challenging the imposition of a\nVCCB fine in the amount of $1,000. Ms. Cook informed\nHiggins that only a portion of the checks he had authorized\nwould be sent out so that there would be sufficient funds\nin his inmate account to satisfy the VCCB fine.\n\nOn June 10, 1998, Daniel Barrajas, ADTC’s Assistant\nMail Supervisor, asked Higgins to endorse the VA disability\nbenefits check. Higgins refused. On the same date, Higgins\nwrote to Superintendent Plantier requesting a written\nexplanation of the disposition of his VA disability benefits\ncheck. Higgins also stated that if he did not receive a\nwritten explanation by June 12, 1998, he would file an\naction in the United States District Court. Superintendent\nPlantier did not reply. Sometime thereafter, ADTC\nemployees deducted $1,000 from Higgins’s inmate account\nto pay the VCCB fine ordered by the New Jersey Superior\nCourt.\n\nII\n\nHiggins filed this S 1983 action on August 4, 1998. Prior\nto filing an answer, the ADTC employees moved to dismiss\nthe complaint on October 14, 1998, pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting\nthat Higgins had failed to state a claim upon which relief\ncan be granted. Higgins filed his opposition to the Rule\n12(b)(6) motion on November 9, 1998.\n\nWhile the motion to dismiss was pending, Higgins filed a\npro se pleading styled as a \"NOTICE OF MOTION IN\nSUPPORT OF AFFIDAVIT/DEPOSITION TO CONSOLIDATE\nTHESE ARGUMENTS WITH THE ABOVE DOCKET CASE\n\n                                5\n\n\nAND/OR ORDER OF PROTECTION/INJUNCTION.\" In this\nmotion, Higgins alleged that ADTC employees brought false\ncharges against him, resulting in his confinement in\nadministrative segregation for 365 days and the denial of\nhis access to the courts, in retaliation for the filing of this\naction for damages for the deprivation of his rights\npursuant to 38 U.S.C. S 5301(a) and the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\fOn June 10, 1999, without the benefit of oral argument,\nthe district court granted the ADTC employees’ motion to\ndismiss this action, for failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief can be granted. In a footnote to its memorandum\nopinion, the district court stated: \"In light of this Court’s\ngranting of the motion to dismiss plaintiff ’s complaint as to\nthe fourteen individual defendants, the later-filed motion of\npro se plaintiff Vincent Higgins for a preliminary injunction\nshall be denied as moot.\" The court did not explain how\nHiggins’s discrete claim that ADTC employees retaliated\nagainst him for asserting his right to access to the courts\nwas rendered moot by his alleged failure to state a claim for\nthe deprivation of his property in violation ofS 5301(a) and\nhis constitutional right to a predeprivation hearing.\n\nHiggins has timely appealed the district court’s final\njudgment in this S 1983 action. Accordingly, we have\njurisdiction over this appeal. 28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nIII\n\nHiggins contends that the district court erred in ruling\nthat he failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that\nthe ADTC employees violated S 1983. He argues that the\ncomplaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim under\nS 1983 either for depriving him of money derived from a VA\ndisability benefits check in violation of S 5301(a), or for\ndenying him his constitutional right to a predeprivation\nhearing to challenge the threat to remove funds derived\nfrom his VA disability benefits check from his inmate\naccount.\n\nOur review of the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) is plenary.

This Court has described the nature of our review as\nfollows:\n\n       We must determine whether, under any reasonable\n       reading of the pleadings, the plaintiffs may be entitled\n       to relief, and we must accept as true the factual\n       allegations in the complaint and all reasonable\n       inferences that can be drawn therefrom. The complaint\n       will be deemed to have alleged sufficient facts if it\n       adequately put the defendants on notice of the\n       essential elements of the plaintiffs’ cause of action.\n       Since this is a S 1983 action, the plaintiffs are entitled\n       to relief if their complaint sufficiently alleges\n       deprivation of any right secured by the Constitution. In\n       considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we do not inquire\n       whether the plaintiffs will ultimately prevail, only\n       whether they are entitled to offer evidence to support\n       their claims. Thus, the district court’s order granting\n       the defendants’ motion to dismiss will be affirmed only\n       if it appears that the plaintiffs could prove no set of\n       facts that would entitle them to relief.\n\fId.

Even though Higgins,\nbecause he is a prisoner, does not presently need or rely\nupon his disability benefits for subsistence, his right\nnonetheless to receive those benefits free from attachment,\nlevy, or seizure is expressly set forth in clear, mandatory\nlanguage in the statute. Section 5301(a) also precludes\nanyone from using any \"legal or equitable process\" to\nattach, levy, or seize these benefits. Thus, S 5301(a)\nsatisfies the conditions set forth in Blessing v. Freestone for\ncreating a federal right enforceable under S 1983.\n\n                                9\n\n\nOur holding that a violation of a veteran’s rights under\n\fS 5301(a) is enforceable against state prison officials\npursuant to S 1983 is supported by the Ninth Circuit’s\ndecision in Nelson v. Heiss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775595\"><a href=\"/opinion/775595/tarza-r-nelson-plaintiff-appellant-cross-appellee-v-barbara-heiss-kw/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2001).\nIn Nelson, the court held that future veteran’s benefits are\nexempt from a hold placed on an inmate’s account where\nthe inmate consented to and the prison officials authorized\nthe hold to cover purchases of medical-record copies and\ndental appliances when there were insufficient funds to\ncover the overdrafts. Id. at 893-96. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat the holds placed on the veteran’s inmate account by\nthe prison officials violated S 5301(a) because a veteran’s\nbenefits are exempt from assignment, attachment, levy, or\nseizure. Id. In Nelson, the state actors were attempting to\nrecoup funds advanced for the veteran’s medical needs. Id.\nat 893. In rejecting the contention of the state actors that\nthey had a right to the funds after providing overdraft\nprotection, the Ninth Circuit reasoned: \"Section 5301(a) was\ndesigned to protect veteran’s benefits against their creditors\nso that the veterans themselves could spend those funds as\nthey saw fit when they actually got them, and not before.\"\nId. at 894.\n\nIn response to the prison officials’ argument that\nCongress could not have intended to prohibit the taking of\na veteran’s disability benefits for his or her maintenance\nand care as allowed by a number of states, the Ninth\nCircuit observed: \"But if Congress wanted to create\nexceptions to [non-attachment or seizure], it knew how to\ndo so.\" Id. at 896. In Nelson, the Ninth Circuit applied\nS 5301(a), notwithstanding the fact that the prisoner had\nspecifically consented to the future payment for the goods\nand services from his account when he received a VA check\nthat would cover his depleted inmate account. Id. at 895.\n\nIn this matter, Higgins did not consent to the taking of\nmoney from his inmate account. Instead, he warned the\nADTC employees that the use of his disability benefits to\nsatisfy the VCCB fine violated S 5301(a). Thus, the matter\nbefore us presents a more compelling factual basis for\napplying S 5301(a) to protect money derived from Higgins’s\ndisability benefits from attachment, levy, or seizure than\nthe circumstances before the Ninth Circuit in Nelson.\n\n                                10\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet construed S 5301(a) to\ndetermine whether prison officials can attach or seize funds\nin an inmate’s account derived from a VA disability benefits\ncheck.

Arkansas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112033\"><a href=\"/opinion/112033/bennett-v-arksansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988), the\nCourt was called upon to determine whether a State can\nattach Social Security benefits to help defray the cost of\nmaintaining its prison system. Id. at 396. The State of\nArkansas filed an action in state court seeking to attach\nBennett’s Social Security benefits to defray the cost of\nmaintaining its prison system pursuant to the State Prison\nInmate Care and Custody Reimbursement Act, Ark. Stat.\nAnn. S 46-1701 et seq. (Supp. 1985). Id. The Arkansas\nstatute expressly authorized the seizure of federal Social\nSecurity benefits for this purpose. Id. at 396 n.1.\n\fIn his opposition to the State’s action, Bennett argued\nthat the Arkansas statute violated the Supremacy Clause\nbecause it was in conflict with 42 U.S.C. S 407(a), which\nexempts Social Security benefits \"from legal process.\" Id. at\n397. Section 407(a) provides in relevant part that\"none of\nthe moneys paid or payable . . . under [the Social Security\nAct] shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment,\ngarnishment, or other legal process.\" 42 U.S.C.S 407(a).\nThe state trial court entered judgment in favor of the State\nand directed that a portion of Bennett’s Social Security\nbenefits be seized. 485 U.S. at 397. The Supreme Court of\nArkansas affirmed, holding that there was no conflict\nbetween the Arkansas statute and 42 U.S.C. S 407(a)\nbecause \" ‘the [Social Security Act] contain[s] an implied\nexception to the exemption from legal process when the\nState provides for the care and maintenance of a\nbeneficiary of social security . . . funds.’ \" Id. at 397 (quoting\nBennett v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (Ark. 1986)).\n\nThe Court granted Bennett’s petition for certiorari and\nreversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.\nId. at 397-98. The Court reasoned as follows:\n\n       We think--contrary to the conclusion of the Supreme\n       Court of Arkansas--that there is a clear inconsistency\n       between the Arkansas statute and 42 U.S.C. S 407(a)\n       (1982 ed., Supp. III). Section 407(a) unambiguously\n       rules out any attempt to attach Social Security\n       benefits. The Arkansas statute just as unambiguously\n\n                                11\n\n\n       allows the State to attach those benefits. As we see it,\n       this amounts to a \"conflict\" under the Supremacy\n       Clause--a conflict that the State cannot win.\n\nId. at 397.\n\nWe recognize that the language used by Congress in\nprotecting Social Security benefits in S 407(a) is not\nprecisely the same as the words it employed in S 5301(a)\nregarding the attachment or seizure of a veteran’s disability\nbenefits. We agree with the Ninth Circuit, however, that \"its\nreach is essentially the same.\" Nelson, 271 F.3d at 895.\n\nWe next turn to the question whether the New Jersey\nstatutes are preempted under the Supremacy Clause\nbecause they are inconsistent with S 5301(a). The ADTC\nemployees argue that the doctrine of preemption is not\napplicable on several grounds. They first maintain that\nthere is no conflict between N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1 and\nS 5301(a). They assert that S 5301(a) is inapplicable because\nthe VCCB is not Higgins’s creditor and the deduction from\nhis inmate account was not accomplished by an\nattachment, levy, or seizure under legal or equitable\nprocess. We disagree. This contention ignores the\nunambiguous intent of the New Jersey legislature in\nenacting the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act of 1971\n\f(\"CICA\"). See N.J. Stat. Ann. S 52:4B-1 et seq. (West 2001).\nThe CICA created the Violent Crimes Compensation Board.\nId. S 52:4B-3.2 Under the provisions of the CICA, the VCCB\nmay order the payment of compensation for personal\ninjuries suffered by the victim of an aggravated sexual\nassault. Id. SS 52:4B-2; 52:4B-11(b)(9).\n\nSection 2C:43-3.1 provides for the collection of funds for\nthe VCCB through court-ordered fines assessed against\npersons convicted of a crime of violence which resulted in\nthe injury of another person. The imposition of the VCCB\nassessment is mandatory. Id. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(1). As noted\nabove, if the assessment is not paid at the time of\nsentencing, the court must order the Department of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The name of the Violent Crimes Compensation Board was changed in\n1995 to the Victims of Crime Compensation Board. N.J. Stat.

S 2C:43-3.1(a)(3). Under such\ncircumstances, employees of the Department of Corrections\nare required to forward the amount collected to the VCCB.\nId.\n\nThe ADTC employees rely on the Fifth Circuit’s decision\nin Department of Health & Rehabilitative Services v. Davis,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375533\"><a href=\"/opinion/375533/department-of-health-and-rehabilitative-services-state-of-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1980), in support of their\nproposition that the VCCB is not a creditor within the\nmeaning of S 5301(a). Their reliance on Davis is misplaced.\nIn Davis, the Florida Department of Health and\nRehabilitative Services filed an action seeking an order\ngranting it reimbursement of $12,000 for the care and\nmaintenance of an incompetent in the Florida State\nHospital. Id. at 829. During the years that the incompetent\nwas hospitalized, his guardian accumulated $40,000 in\nSocial Security and veteran’s benefits. Id. His guardian\nrefused to reimburse the Florida Department of Health and\nRehabilitative Services on the basis that the moneys\nreceived from federal Social Security and veteran’s benefits\nstatutes were exempt from a creditor’s claims. Id. The\ndistrict court denied relief. Id. The Fifth Circuit reversed. Id.\nIt concluded that since the purpose of each federal statute\nwas to provide for the care and maintenance of its\nbeneficiaries, it was consistent with that goal to reimburse\na state agency that provided for an incompetent person’s\ncare and maintenance. Id. at 831-32.\n\nIn the matter sub judice, the intent of the New Jersey\nLegislature in enacting the CICA was not aimed at\nproviding for the care and maintenance of persons\nconvicted of violent crimes. The CICA’s purpose is to\ncompensate victims of violent crimes for their injuries.\nMoreover, subsequent to Davis, the Supreme Court\nrejected, in the context of Social Security benefits, the very\n\fargument the state made in Davis. Bennett, 485 U.S. at\n397-98. As we have explained, the Supreme Court\ninterpreted the language of 42 U.S.C. S 407(a) as barring\nArkansas from retaining an inmate’s Social Security\nbenefits, regardless of its purpose in doing so. The very\nsimilar mandatory and all-inclusive language ofS 5301(a)\nrequires the same conclusion here.\n\n                                13\n\n\nA creditor is a person or entity to whom a debt is owed.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 375 (7th ed. 1999). A debtor is a\nperson who owes an obligation to another. Id. at 411.\nPursuant to the CICA, a court must order a person\nconvicted of a violent crime to pay an assessment to the\nVCCB. N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(1). The judgment is\nenforceable by requiring employees of the New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections to seize the amount owing to the\nVCCB from the inmate’s account. Id. S 2C:43-3.1(a)(3).\nThus, contrary to the position of the ADTC employees, the\nVCCB is a creditor within the meaning of S 5301(a). The\nCICA has created a creditor-debtor relationship between a\nperson convicted of the crime of aggravated sexual assault\nand the VCCB that is enforceable by a court order.\n\nThe ADTC employees also maintain that the deduction of\nfunds derived from Higgins’s VA disability benefits check\ndid not violate S 5301(a) because it was not effected by\nattachment, levy, seizure by or under any legal or equitable\nprocess. As discussed above, the CICA requires a New\nJersey court to \"specifically order the Department of\nCorrections to collect the assessment during the period of\nincarceration and to deduct the assessment . . . from any\npersonal account established in the institution for the\nbenefit of the inmate.\" N.J. Stat. Ann. S 2C:43-3.1. The\nterm \"levy\" is defined as the seizure of property to satisfy a\njudgment. Black’s Law Dictionary, supra, at 919. We are\npersuaded that the collection of funds from Higgins’s\ninmate account by the ADTC employees was clearly a levy\nor a seizure required by New Jersey law.\n\nThe ADTC employees further assert that N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 2C:43-3.1(a)(3) does not conflict with S 5301(a) because\nNew Jersey law \"mandates the care, government and\nmaintenance of inmates by the Commissioner of the\nDepartment of Corrections, thereby fulfilling the\nCongressional intent of 38 U.S.C. S 5301(a).\" Appellees Br.\nat 19-20. The Supreme Court rejected a similar argument\nin Bennett. There, the Court noted thatS 407(a) of the\nSocial Security Act does not contain \"an ‘implied exception’\nthat would allow attachment of otherwise exempted federal\npayments simply because the State has provided the\nrecipient with ‘care and maintenance.’ \" 485 U.S. at 397.\n\n                                14\n\n\nLikewise, S 5301(a) does not contain an implied exception\nwhich would allow the collection of funds derived from a VA\n\fdisability benefits check to compensate his or her crime\nvictim merely because New Jersey law requires the\nDepartment of Corrections to provide for an inmate’s care\nand maintenance.\n\nAs noted previously, Congress’s purpose in enacting\nS 5301(a) was to \"prevent the deprivation and depletion of\nthe means of subsistence of veterans dependent upon these\nbenefits as the main source of their income.\" Rose, 481\nU.S. at 630. Section 2C:43-3.1(a)(3) expressly allows the\ndeduction of any funds located in an inmate’s personal\naccount. To the extent this statute allows the deduction of\nfunds derived from a VA disability benefits check, its\nprovisions conflict with S 5301(a). \"A state law is in conflict,\nand void under the supremacy clause, if it stands as an\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\npurposes and objective of Congress.\" Finberg v.

The Supreme Court has explained the\nrequirements of the Due Process Clause as follows:\n\n       In situations where the State feasibly can provide a\n       predeprivation hearing before taking property, it\n\n                                15\n\n\n       generally must do so regardless of the adequacy of a\n       postdeprivation tort remedy to compensate for the\n       taking. Conversely, in situations where a\n       predeprivation hearing is unduly burdensome in\n       proportion to the liberty interest at stake, or where the\n       State is truly unable to anticipate and prevent a\n       random deprivation of a liberty interest,\n       postdeprivation remedies might satisfy due process.\n\nZinermon v. Burch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620710\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620710/zinermon-v-burch/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 (1990) (citations\nomitted).\n\nHiggins alleged in his complaint that the ADTC\nemployees took money from his inmate account without\n\fproviding him with a predeprivation hearing. The ADTC\nemployees argue that they did not improperly deny Higgins\na predeprivation hearing because the New Jersey Torts\nClaims Act provides Higgins with an adequate\npostdeprivation remedy to seek money damages for the\nseizure of his property. Higgins did not allege facts that\ndemonstrate that his funds were seized as the result of a\nrandom, negligent, or unauthorized act of an ADTC\nemployee. Rather, Higgins alleged that the ADTC employees\nwere acting under the authority of an established state\nprocedure for seizing a prisoner’s funds to satisfy court-\nordered fines. The ADTC employees have argued before this\nCourt that they were acting pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 2C:43-3.1(a)(3) when they deducted funds from Higgins’s\naccount. Thus, under Zinermon, Higgins was entitled to\nnotice and hearing before the ADTC employees deducted\nmoney from his account.\n\nHiggins has alleged sufficient facts to establish that he\nwas entitled to a predeprivation notice and hearing. 3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. We note that the alleged violation of Higgins’s Fourteenth Amendment\nright to due process occurred at the moment he was deprived of his\nproperty interest without notice and a predeprivation hearing (i.e., when\nthe ADTC employees seized the money in his inmate account). Thus,\nHiggins’s procedural due process claim would not be rendered moot even\nif he is ultimately successful in recovering the $1,000 under his\nS 5301(a) claim. In such a situation, Higgins would still be entitled to\nnominal damages on a successful procedural due process claim despite\nthe fact that he may be unable to prove actual injury from the\n\n                                16\n\n\nMoreover, Higgins’s procedural due process rights are\nenforceable under S 1983. See Zinermon, 494 U.S. at 125\n(\"A S 1983 action may be brought for a violation of\nprocedural due process . . . .\"). The district court erred in\ndismissing Higgins’s procedural due process claim under\nRule 12(b)(6).\n\nIV\n\nThe district court did not disclose the basis for the\ndismissal of Higgins’s claim that the ADTC employees\nretaliated against him because he exercised his federal\nconstitutional right to seek access to the courts for an\nadjudication of his claims that he was deprived of his rights\nunder S 5301(a) and the Due Process Clause. A person may\nstate an independent cause of action for retaliation for the\nexercise of his or her right of access to the courts,\nregardless of whether the allegations of a deprivation of\nfederal statutory or constitutional rights are meritorious.\nSee White v. Napoleon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537200\"><a href=\"/opinion/537200/norwood-l-white-individually-and-on-behalf-of-others-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111-12 (3d Cir. 1990)\n(\"Retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected\nrights is itself a violation of rights secured by the\nConstitution actionable under section 1983.\"). The district\ncourt erred in dismissing Higgins’s claim for retaliation for\nthe exercise of his rights under federal law.\n\fConclusion\n\nHiggins’s complaint alleged sufficient facts to support a\nS 1983 claim that he was deprived of his rights under\nS 5301(a) and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Accordingly, we VACATE the dismissal of this\naction. Upon REMAND, the district court is directed to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndeprivation of his property interest in the $1,000. See Carey v.
