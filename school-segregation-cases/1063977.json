The law is no stranger to the\n\ntragedies of life.      In February 2002, Michael Buchanan, a mentally\n\nill man, was shot to death inside his isolated Maine home when he\n\nrepeatedly stabbed one of two deputy sheriffs who had gone to check\n\non Buchanan's safety and welfare.\n\n            Believing     that    Buchanan's       death    was    preventable,\n\nMichael's    brother    Daniel,    as    administrator,      and   the   estate\n\n(together, \"plaintiff\") filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\n\nLincoln County, two sheriffs, and the two deputy sheriffs, saying\n\nthat the officers should never have entered the house and that\n\ntheir warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment.                Plaintiff\n\ndoes not contend that the officers were unjustified in the shooting\n\n-- only that they were unjustified in entering the house, and so\n\nsetting off the fatal chain of events.\n\n            Plaintiff also sued the State of Maine and the County on\n\nthe theory that they failed to reasonably accommodate Buchanan's\n\nneed for mental health services as required by Title II of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), see 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131,\n\n12132,   thus   causing   his     death.        Plaintiff   further   made   the\n\nconstitutional claim that Buchanan's case manager, Joel Gilbert,\n\nand Gilbert's supervisor, Julianne Edmondson, violated Buchanan's\n\n\"class of one\" equal protection rights.\n\n            The State of Maine asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nto the plaintiff's ADA Title II claim.              The district court held\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthat Title II does not validly abrogate a State's immunity as to\n\nclaims of access to mental health services and so granted summary\n\njudgment to the State.1   Buchanan v. Maine, 417 F. Supp. 2d 24, 38-\n\n41 (D. Me. 2006); Buchanan v. Maine, 377 F. Supp. 2d 276, 279-83\n\n(D. Me. 2005).\n\n          The lengthy and complicated procedural history in this\n\ncase need not be recited.    Ultimately, the district court entered\n\nsummary judgment for defendants on all claims.2   417 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n44-45 (State defendants); Buchanan v. Maine, 417 F. Supp. 2d 45,\n\n74-75 (D. Me. 2006) (County defendants).     We discuss the court's\n\nreasons and the factual record under the pertinent topics.       We\n\naffirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Lincoln County,\n\nthe two deputy sheriffs, and Buchanan's case manager. We also hold\n\nthat judgment for the State of Maine should be entered on the basis\n\nthat plaintiff failed to establish a claim under Title II.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          We review a grant of summary judgment de novo; in doing\n\nso, we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n\n     1\n          Because   this   case   involves   an   attack   on   the\nconstitutionality of a federal statute, this court notified the\nAttorney General, see Fed. R. App. P. 44(a), who in turn intervened\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a) and has provided helpful argument,\nboth by brief and orally.\n     2\n          Plaintiff does not appeal the district court's entry of\nsummary judgment in favor of the State defendants on plaintiff's\nclaims under the Maine Tort Claims Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n14, § 8101 et seq. See Buchanan, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 44.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fnonmoving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.\n\nSuarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nIssues of law are reviewed de novo.          Cotter v. Mass. Ass'n of\n\nMinority Law Enforcement Officers, 219 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           The following facts are undisputed, except as otherwise\n\nnoted.   Michael Buchanan was born in 1940 and moved to Maine in\n\napproximately 1978.     Buchanan had shown signs of mental illness\n\nsince the early 1970s.       He was involuntarily committed to the\n\nAugusta Mental Health Institute (AMHI) on two separate occasions.\n\nThe first admission was in 1988, and the second admission lasted\n\nfrom September 11, 1999 to October 19, 1999.\n\n           During this time there was litigation in the state courts\n\nover whether Maine, \"in its . . . provision of treatment and\n\nservices to present and former patients of AMHI,\" was violating the\n\nstate and federal constitutions as well as state and federal laws.\n\nBates v. Dep't of Behavioral & Developmental Servs., 863 A.2d 890,\n\n894 (Me. 2004).     In 1990, the parties settled the class action\n\nlawsuit by an agreement and consent decree in which Maine did not\n\nadmit liability, and in which the State was to provide certain\n\nhealth   care   services.3   Every   class   member,   generally,   upon\n\n\n     3\n          The consent decree provided that the plaintiff class\n\"would close, retroactive to the State's filing a notice of\nsubstantial compliance, upon the date when the court determined\nthat the State was in substantial compliance with the consent\ndecree.\" Bates, 863 A.2d at 895. As of late 2004, the State had\nnot yet \"carr[ied] its burden to establish substantial compliance\nwith the 1990 consent decree.\" Id. at 913.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdischarge from AMHI was entitled to receive an Individualized\n\nSupport Plan (ISP) assessing the class member's strengths and\n\nneeds, describing the class member's goals and objectives, and\n\nlisting the services the class member needed to meet his or her\n\ngoals and objectives.       These individualized plans were to be\n\n\"coordinated and monitored by a community support worker\" who was\n\nthen responsible for locating and delivering the needed services.\n\nBuchanan was a member of this class, as he was discharged from AMHI\n\nin October 1999.\n\n            In September 1999, while at AMHI, Buchanan was diagnosed\n\nwith bipolar disorder with psychosis, schizo-affective disorder,\n\nand schizophrenia with paranoia.     He was discharged on October 19,\n\n1999, having been prescribed three medications:         lithium, Haldol,\n\nand Cogentin.   Buchanan was assigned to Joel Gilbert, an intensive\n\ncase manager with three years of experience in that position.           As\n\nan intensive case manager, Gilbert was a community support worker\n\nwho   was   responsible   for   helping    mental   health   clients   live\n\nindependently in the community.           Gilbert described his job as\n\nhelping clients obtain mental health services, as well as any other\n\nservices they might need, such as housing assistance, welfare\n\nbenefits, medical care, and fuel assistance.            In the community\n\nsupport program, he handled the cases of ten to twelve high-risk\n\npatients who were seriously mentally ill.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f              Over the next month and a half in 1999, Gilbert visited\n\nBuchanan's house about once a week to check up on him.                        The house\n\nwas    located      at     the   end   of   a     one-half-    to   three-quarter-mile\n\ndriveway that was frequently impassable by a regular vehicle.                         On\n\na number of Gilbert's visits, Buchanan told Gilbert that he did not\n\nwant to participate in the ISP process.                       The plaintiff maintains\n\nthat Gilbert did not properly engage Buchanan in developing an ISP.\n\nIt is uncontested that on December 2, 1999, Gilbert completed an\n\n\"outreach plan\" for Buchanan, under which Gilbert would make weekly\n\nvisits to Buchanan to check on his living conditions, offer rides\n\nto    town    for    errands,      take     him    to   doctor's    appointments,     and\n\nencourage him to take his medications.\n\n              Gilbert continued to visit Buchanan over the next two\n\nyears.       He took Buchanan grocery shopping at least eleven times.\n\nGilbert took Buchanan to see the doctor at least eight times,\n\npicked up and delivered prescription drugs for Buchanan, took\n\nBuchanan to get fitted for glasses, and attended a dentist's\n\nappointment         with    Buchanan.        Gilbert      obtained    state   funds    to\n\npurchase a wood stove and a propane heating system for Buchanan's\n\nhome, as well as a watch so that Buchanan would know when to go out\n\nto the main road to be picked up by Gilbert.                        On two occasions,\n\nGilbert also helped Buchanan fill out food stamp applications.\n\n              Plaintiff          asserts     that,      beginning    in   early   2001,\n\nBuchanan, after previously announcing that he would no longer take\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fhis   medications,   began   to   demonstrate   signs   of   psychological\n\ndecompensation.\n\n           It is agreed that on December 28, 2001, Gilbert went to\n\nBuchanan's home to take him to a fuel assistance appointment.\n\nBuchanan accused Gilbert of shutting off his gas and became angry\n\nwith Gilbert, claiming to have five gun permits and telling Gilbert\n\nhe did not trust him.    Gilbert told Buchanan he could not take him\n\nto his fuel assistance appointment in such a condition.         According\n\nto Gilbert's written report, Buchanan waved his arms, made profane\n\nstatements, and went back into his house stating, \"Don't come back\n\nhere later, I don't want any[ ]more help, and don't bring those\n\nsheriffs here anymore either.\"       As a result of this interaction,\n\nGilbert believed it would be prudent to have a co-worker accompany\n\nhim on any future visits.\n\n           Three days later, on December 31, 2001, Gilbert and a co-\n\nworker visited Buchanan's home.       Buchanan was polite and did not\n\nappear to remember his angry interaction with Gilbert.           This was\n\nGilbert's last visit to Buchanan.\n\n           Gilbert attempted to visit Buchanan twice in January\n\n2002, but both times was unable to find a co-worker to accompany\n\nhim. On February 5, 2002, Gilbert called Buchanan's brother Daniel\n\nto explain that he had been having difficulty making visits because\n\nBuchanan \"ha[d] become angry with [his] support.\"        Gilbert did say\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthat   he   had   been   keeping   watch       over    Buchanan       through    Terry\n\nJohnston, Buchanan's neighbor and friend.\n\n            On February 25, 2002, Johnston called Gilbert to report\n\nthat Buchanan had growled and glared at her that morning, and that\n\naround 4:30 p.m. the same day, she had learned that someone\n\nresembling    Buchanan    had   been    spotted       lighting    a    fire     in   her\n\nwoodpile.     Gilbert told Johnston that the fire was a criminal\n\nmatter and that she should call the police.\n\n            The   remaining     facts    are    pertinent    particularly            for\n\nplaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim.             Because Buchanan was killed,\n\nthere is no dispute with respect to most of the facts surrounding\n\nthe events after the deputies arrived at his house.                    We have only\n\nthe account of the deputies.            In limited respects, as described\n\nlater, plaintiff offers a somewhat different version based either\n\non speculation or on inference from physical facts such as the\n\nautopsy results.\n\n            Johnston took Gilbert's advice and called the Lincoln\n\nCounty Sheriff's Department at approximately 5:11 p.m. on February\n\n25, 2002, asking that officers perform a welfare check on Buchanan.\n\nDeputy Kenneth Hatch was assigned to respond to Johnston's call.\n\nJohnston told Hatch that she had contacted Buchanan's counselor\n\nabout her concerns, and that Gilbert had said he would check on\n\nBuchanan the following day.        She also told Hatch that although she\n\ndid not wish to pursue any criminal charges, she was afraid\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fBuchanan might light her barn on fire.                   After speaking with\n\nJohnston, Hatch asked Deputy Robert Emerson to accompany him to\n\nBuchanan's home.         Another officer informed Hatch that Buchanan had\n\na serious mental illness.             The deputies had not had any prior\n\ndealings with Buchanan. In response to Johnston's request, the two\n\nofficers promptly went out to Buchanan's house.\n\n              At approximately 5:59 p.m., in the winter dark, the\n\ndeputies arrived at Buchanan's unplowed, snow-covered access road\n\nand    set    off   on    foot   to   reach    the   house.     The      house   was\n\napproximately thirty-six feet long and twenty-four feet wide, and\n\nhad a \"daylight basement\" with a single story over the basement.\n\nThe deputies walked outside the house to the area where lights were\n\non in the upstairs of the house.          Hatch knocked on the door leading\n\ninto   the     basement    several    times,   but   there    was   no   response.\n\nEmerson saw Buchanan walk to the window on the long side of the\n\nhouse.       Buchanan appeared to be screaming something, but Emerson\n\ncould not hear what he was saying.\n\n              Buchanan then walked to a window on the short side of the\n\nhouse, and pushed it open.            Buchanan screamed out the window that\n\nhe worked for the Massachusetts Sheriff's Department; he also said,\n\n\"You are not throwing me in a Nazi Jewish oven.\"                Emerson yelled,\n\n\"Michael, are you okay?          We are here to check on you.\"            Buchanan\n\nanswered that the deputies were not there to check on him, and then\n\nhe started screaming about being with the New York State Police,\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthat he was with the federal government, and that he had the right\n\nto sell guns.    Buchanan also said something about \"not having any\n\nfires.\"     Emerson yelled to Hatch and asked if he saw any fires.\n\nHatch walked around the house, looking for open fires in or around\n\nthe building.    He found none.\n\n            Emerson explained to Buchanan that they only wanted to\n\ntalk to him, but Buchanan said \"No\" and that they were trying to\n\nget \"Evelyn\" after him.    Buchanan told the deputies to get off his\n\nproperty, to go back to the main road, and that he was going to\n\nkill them.\n\n            Buchanan walked away from the window, then reappeared and\n\nthrew some liquid at Emerson.     Emerson managed to avoid being hit\n\nby most of the liquid, which smelled of liquor.      Emerson thought\n\nthat Buchanan was \"beyond agitated\" and seemed upset with the\n\nofficers for reasons wholly unrelated to the stated purpose of\n\ntheir visit.    Buchanan then shut the window, turned off the light\n\nin the room, went to the other side of the house, and turned lights\n\non there.\n\n            Around 6:20 p.m., while Emerson was still trying to talk\n\nwith Buchanan, Hatch radioed dispatch to advise the officer of the\n\nsituation and asked him to get in touch with Buchanan's mental\n\nhealth counselor to see what he advised.     About one minute later,\n\nHatch was told that Gilbert's line was busy; he instructed the\n\nofficer to break through the line.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f          There was a loud smashing sound, which Emerson thought\n\nmight be a gunshot; Hatch told Emerson that he was unsure but\n\nbelieved the noise was that of a window breaking. At approximately\n\n6:24 p.m., after hearing the noise of shattering glass, Hatch spoke\n\nto dispatch and requested that the on-call supervisor be contacted\n\nand advised.4    Hatch did not tell Emerson that he had called the\n\nsupervisor for advice.\n\n          Buchanan walked down the stairs of his home and appeared\n\nat the basement door.     Emerson could see that the knuckles on at\n\nleast one of Buchanan's hands were bloody.      Emerson thought that\n\nBuchanan had put his fist through glass, and that this explained\n\nthe earlier smashing sound.      Buchanan opened the door and began\n\nscreaming at Emerson and swearing about the \"warrants.\"      Emerson\n\nexplained in a soft voice that the deputies were only at Buchanan's\n\nhouse to talk to him.    Buchanan spit on Emerson, hitting the deputy\n\non his chest.    Emerson continued to speak to Buchanan in a quiet,\n\ncalm voice.     Buchanan then turned and walked back into the house.\n\nWe take these facts as the deputies recount them because plaintiff\n\nhas offered no contrary facts.\n\n          Emerson followed Buchanan into the house.    Buchanan, who\n\nwas on the second or third step of the staircase, spit at Emerson\n\nagain. In his incident report, Emerson explained that by this time\n\n\n     4\n          Although dispatch later radioed Hatch that the supervisor\nwas on the way, Hatch did not receive the message because, by then,\nthere had been the struggle in Buchanan's home.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhe had decided that even though Buchanan had committed several\n\ncriminal acts, Emerson's thoughts were not to arrest Buchanan, but\n\nthat it would be best to put Buchanan in protective custody and\n\nhave him evaluated, because Emerson believed Buchanan was in an\n\nunstable   mental   state.   Emerson    listed   Buchanan's   agitated\n\ncondition, his nonsensical screaming, and his apparently self-\n\ninflicted injuries as reasons why he believed putting Buchanan into\n\nprotective custody was appropriate.\n\n           Hatch came to the door and saw a \"spot of blood\" on one\n\nof Buchanan's hands.    Buchanan was again yelling and screaming,\n\nwith his hands on the railing of the staircase.      Emerson observed\n\nthat there was fresh blood on Buchanan's hands, and although there\n\nwasn't \"a lot\" of blood, there was a \"substantial\" amount of blood.\n\nEmerson attempted to grab both of Buchanan's hands to subdue him,\n\nbut Buchanan pulled his hands back, spit at Emerson a third time,\n\nand started up the basement stairs.     Emerson followed.5\n\n           Buchanan went into a room and then returned to the top of\n\nthe basement stairs, now carrying a knife.       By this time, Deputy\n\nEmerson was almost at the top of the staircase, and Deputy Hatch\n\nwas on the third or fourth step.       Buchanan grabbed Emerson, and\n\nEmerson in turn attempted to reach for the knife. Buchanan grabbed\n\n\n     5\n          There is no support in the record for plaintiff's\nargument that Emerson broke into Buchanan's house (by pushing a\nplywood panel out of the door and removing a two-by-four that had\nbeen wedged against the door as a lock) and that Emerson and Hatch\ncrept up the stairs only to be startled by Buchanan at the landing.\n\n                                -13-\n\fEmerson's back and pushed him down against the stairs.                    Emerson\n\nscreamed \"knife\" as Buchanan stabbed Emerson in the back of the\n\nshoulder.         Emerson screamed for Hatch's help.        Hatch drew his gun;\n\nBuchanan looked at Hatch as he continued to stab Emerson and did\n\nnot stop.          Hatch fired, but Buchanan stabbed Emerson at least two\n\nmore times in the back and more times in the back of the head.6\n\nHatch then repeatedly shot Buchanan until Buchanan fell over the\n\nrailing on the stairs to the floor below.               Hatch had hit Buchanan\n\na total of four times.          The first shot had hit Buchanan on the left\n\nside of his skull; the second, third, and fourth shots had all\n\nentered the left side of Buchanan's neck.               The wounds were fatal.\n\n                                           II.\n\nA.                Summary Judgment Standard\n\n                  Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"                 Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).       For\n\nsummary judgment purposes, \"'genuine' means that 'the evidence is\n\nsuch       that    a   reasonable   jury   could   return   a   verdict   for   the\n\nnonmoving party,' and a 'material fact' is one which 'might affect\n\nthe outcome of the suit under the governing law.'\"                 Seaboard Sur.\n\n\n       6\n          Emerson was taken by ambulance to the hospital and was\ntreated for his wounds. He was discharged later on the evening of\nFebruary 25, 2002.\n\n                                           -14-\n\fCo. v.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248,\n\n(1986))) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            We review the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\nde novo, \"construing the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's\n\nfavor.\" Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nHowever,    we    may    ignore    \"conclusory      allegations,     improbable\n\ninferences,      and    unsupported     speculation\"     put   forward     by   the\n\nnonmoving party.

Section 1983 Claim Against Deputies Emerson and Hatch\n\n            The parties agree on the applicable constitutional theory\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment.              \"In terms that apply equally to\n\nseizures   of    property    and   to    seizures   of   persons,    the   Fourth\n\nAmendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house.\n\nAbsent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be\n\ncrossed without a warrant.\"           United States v. Adams, 621 F.2d 41,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1980) (quoting Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 590\n\n(1980))    (internal     quotation      marks   omitted).      Law   enforcement\n\nofficers may make warrantless entries \"when they reasonably believe\n\nthat a person within is in need of immediate aid.\"                    Mincey v.\n\nArizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392 (1978).\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            Following the dictates of Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194\n\n(2001), this circuit uses a three-part test when evaluating a\n\nquestion of qualified immunity.        \"In a suit against an officer for\n\nan alleged violation of a constitutional right, the requisites of\n\na   qualified     immunity   defense   must   be   considered      in   proper\n\nsequence.\"      Id. at 200.    The court \"generally [should] address\n\nfirst the question whether at some abstract level the plaintiffs\n\nhave asserted a violation of constitutional rights, second whether\n\nthose    rights    are   clearly   established,    and     third   whether   a\n\nreasonable officer could have concluded that his actions did not\n\nviolate plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\" Tremblay v. McClellan,\n\n350 F.3d 195, 199 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Plaintiff     argues   that    there    were    no     extenuating\n\ncircumstances to justify the officers' decision to enter Buchanan's\n\nhouse without a warrant when they did, that no reasonable officer\n\nwould have thought there were such circumstances, and that the\n\nentry inevitably led to Buchanan's death.          According to plaintiff,\n\nBuchanan's odd behavior and ranting did not justify entry into the\n\nhouse.    In fact, plaintiff argues, Buchanan made it clear that he\n\nwanted the deputies to leave, and had the officers done so,\n\nBuchanan would be alive today.\n\n            Plaintiff also argues that Buchanan posed no threat to\n\nhimself.     The cut on his hand, as the autopsy photos showed, was\n\nnot serious.      Nor did Buchanan pose any threat to anyone else.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fFurthermore, Buchanan did not provoke anyone: it was the officers\n\nwho came to Buchanan and made him feel threatened, particularly\n\nwhen they entered Buchanan's house after he made it plain they\n\nshould leave.      Plaintiff argues that a reasonable officer would\n\nhave    waited    outside   Buchanan's     house   before   making   such   a\n\nprecipitous entry.       After all, plaintiff argues, Hatch had asked\n\nthe dispatch officer to contact Gilbert for advice on how to\n\nproceed.     Hatch should have waited to get that advice.\n\n             There are no material disputes of fact, only disagreement\n\nabout the conclusions to be drawn.          The district court held that\n\ndefendants were entitled to summary judgment on the merits, and\n\nthat whether or not Hatch and Emerson had violated Buchanan's\n\nFourth Amendment rights, the deputies would nonetheless be entitled\n\nto qualified immunity.      Buchanan, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 57-60.\n\n             Turning to the first step of the immunity analysis, if we\n\nwere to look only at the allegations in plaintiff's complaint, then\n\nwe would conclude that the plaintiff has asserted a constitutional\n\nright   to   be   free   from   warrantless   entry   in    the   absence   of\n\nextenuating circumstances.       The question becomes more complicated\n\nwhen there has been development of facts and a summary judgment\n\nrecord is before the court.           We addressed that situation in\n\nRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55 (1st Cir. 2004):\n\n             Where, as here, qualified immunity is brought\n             at the summary judgment stage, the inquiry on\n             the first prong is somewhat different.    The\n             language in Saucier is ambiguous on this\n\n                                    -17-\n\f            point; the case refers both to \"the facts\n            alleged\" and to the \"parties' submissions.\"\n            But subsequent Supreme Court cases have\n            clarified, implicitly if not explicitly, that\n            courts assessing the first prong at summary\n            judgment should look beyond the complaint to\n            the broader summary judgment record.\n\nId. at 61-62 (citation omitted) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201).\n\n            We   noted     that    there   was    some   flexibility     in    the\n\napplication of the first prong, and that Saucier itself suggested\n\nthat the law elaboration function of the first prong would be well\n\nserved only in \"appropriate cases.\"              Id. at 62 (quoting Saucier,\n\n533 U.S. at 207) (internal quotation marks omitted).                     We also\n\nobserved:\n\n            [I]n some cases, such as where the claim\n            depends on a \"kaleidoscope of facts not yet\n            fully developed,\" the law elaboration function\n            is not well served and thus the Saucier rule\n            may not strictly apply. Moreover, the level\n            of specificity at which the first prong is\n            analyzed may change depending on a given\n            inquiry's utility in further elaborating the\n            law.\n\nId. (citation omitted) (quoting Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,\n\n315 F.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2002)).               In Riverdale, we did not\n\naddress, on the first prong, the question of Fourth Amendment\n\nreasonableness, but rather the antecedent question of law as to\n\nwhether there had been a \"search.\"            Id. at 62-64.\n\n            We do not think the law elaboration purpose will be well\n\nserved   here,     where     the     Fourth      Amendment    question    is     a\n\nreasonableness question which is highly idiosyncratic and heavily\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fdependent on the facts. The question is close whether under normal\n\nsummary judgment rules, drawing all inferences in plaintiff's\n\nfavor, this record would preclude submission to the jury of the\n\nquestion whether, given the circumstances, the officers reasonably\n\nentered Buchanan's house when they did rather than wait to see if\n\nthey could break through a busy phone line to ask Buchanan's social\n\nworker for advice.     On summary judgment on qualified immunity, the\n\nthreshold question is whether all the uncontested facts and any\n\ncontested     facts   looked     at    in    plaintiff's    favor     show   a\n\nconstitutional violation.        Burke v. Town of Walpole, 405 F.3d 66,\n\n77 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Perez v. Oakland County, --- F.3d ---,\n\nNo. 05-1583, 2006 WL 2956513, at *8-9 (6th Cir. Oct. 18, 2006).\n\nGiven the complexity of the matter, and since it is perfectly clear\n\nthat the officers are entitled to immunity, we turn to the second\n\nand third prongs.     Cf. Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198 (2004)\n\n(expressing    no   view   on   correctness   of   the   Court   of   Appeals'\n\ndecision on constitutional question, but reaching remaining prongs\n\nof immunity analysis).\n\n            At the time of the deputies' visit to Buchanan's home, it\n\nhad been clearly established that \"a warrantless entry . . . of a\n\nresidence may be 'reasonable,' in Fourth Amendment terms,\" but was\n\nnot reasonable unless \"the government [could] demonstrate . . .\n\n'exigent circumstances,'\" such as \"an imminent threat to the life\n\nor safety of members of the public, the police officers, or a\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fperson   located   within   the   residence.\"      McCabe    v.   Life-Line\n\nAmbulance Serv., Inc., 77 F.3d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1995); Hegarty\n\nv. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st Cir. 1995)); see also\n\nBrigham City v. Stuart, 126 S. Ct. 1943, 1947 (2006) (\"[L]aw\n\nenforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render\n\nemergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an\n\noccupant from imminent injury.\" (citing Mincey, 437 U.S. at 392));\n\nWelsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 748-49 (1984); United States v.\n\nCurzi, 867 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           But,    under    Saucier,   that     level   of   analysis    is\n\ninsufficient. The relevant inquiry is whether it would be clear to\n\na reasonable officer that his conduct would be unlawful in the\n\nsituation he confronted, and this inquiry must be taken in light of\n\nthe case's specific context, not as a broad general proposition.\n\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201-02.      We cannot say the officers had fair\n\nwarning under the law that if they entered the house when they did,\n\nthey would violate Buchanan's Fourth Amendment rights. While there\n\nis no case directly on point, case law tended to support the\n\nofficers' actions, not put them on notice of illegality.                Cf.\n\nAnthony v. City of New York, 339 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir. 2003)\n\n(qualified immunity affirmed for officers who made warrantless\n\nentry to apartment of mentally ill woman who claimed to be under\n\nattack).\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f          The   third   prong   of    the   qualified   immunity   analysis\n\nrecognizes that \"law enforcement officials will in some cases\n\nreasonably but mistakenly conclude that [their conduct] is . . .\n\nlawful\"; \"in such cases those officials -- like other officials who\n\nact in ways they reasonably believe to be lawful -- should not be\n\nheld personally liable.\"    Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641\n\n(1987).   Even if we were wrong in our analysis thus far, the\n\ndeputies would be entitled to immunity on the third prong.             Our\n\ninquiry at this stage is limited to those objective facts known to\n\n(or discernible by) the officers at the time of the event.         Tibolt,\n\n72 F.3d at 969.\n\n          Emerson and Hatch argue that they reasonably believed\n\ntheir actions were lawful and were authorized by Maine's protective\n\ncustody statute, which provides:\n\n          If a law enforcement officer has reasonable\n          grounds to believe, based upon probable cause,\n          that a person may be mentally ill and that due\n          to that condition the person presents a threat\n          of imminent and substantial physical harm to\n          that person or to other persons, . . . the law\n          enforcement officer . . . [m]ay take the\n          person into protective custody . . . .\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-B, § 3862(1), (1)(A). Plaintiff agrees\n\nthat the statute meets constitutional standards. And we agree with\n\nplaintiff that the Maine statute does not permit warrantless entry\n\ninto a home simply because officers think the occupant is mentally\n\nill.\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f           The police had grounds to go to the house because someone\n\nmatching Buchanan's description had been spotted attempting to\n\nlight a fire on Terry Johnston's woodpile, Johnston had requested\n\nthat they go and check on Buchanan's welfare, and she also said she\n\nwas afraid her barn would be set afire.   The deputies certainly had\n\nreasonable grounds to believe that Buchanan was mentally ill.\n\nHatch had been informed of this fact by another officer, and the\n\ncall from Johnston gave rise to suspicion.    The phone call was not\n\nfrom an anonymous caller, and Johnston directly asked that the\n\ndeputies check on Buchanan; Deputy Hatch also knew that Johnston\n\nhad just spoken with Buchanan's mental health counselor, who was\n\nplanning on visiting Buchanan the next day.    Moreover, Buchanan's\n\nown behavior, discussed earlier, clearly confirmed his mental\n\nillness.\n\n           The deputies also had reasonable grounds to believe that\n\nBuchanan presented a threat of imminent and substantial physical\n\nharm to himself or others, including the deputies themselves.   The\n\ncut on Buchanan's hand, caused by his punching out a window, need\n\nnot have been life threatening for the officers to have been\n\njustified in entering the house.   See Brigham City, 126 S. Ct. at\n\n1947 (citing Mincey, 437 U.S. at 392).\n\n           As to risk to others: Buchanan had threatened to kill\n\nEmerson and Hatch; he had thrown liquid at Emerson; he had spit at\n\nEmerson three times; someone matching his description had been\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fspotted attempting to light a fire in his neighbor's woodpile; and\n\nthe neighbor was afraid Buchanan would burn down her barn.\n\n            A reasonable officer could have believed that waiting was\n\nnot a good idea.     There was no assurance the deputies could reach\n\nthe social worker or that he would have been able to calm Buchanan\n\nor   provide    meaningful   help   to   the   officers   from   his   remote\n\nlocation.      Plaintiff put on no evidence that a reasonable officer\n\nwould have waited.      Further, the situation was escalating, with\n\nBuchanan punching out a window on a cold night, and the deputies\n\ndid not know that the social worker would be available once the\n\nphone line was cleared.      Even if the officers were mistaken, this\n\nwas a reasonable judgment call, and they are entitled to immunity.7\n\nSee Tremblay, 350 F.3d at 200-01 (finding qualified immunity on\n\nthird prong for officer who took into protective custody a teenager\n\nwhen it was reasonable to suspect youth's person or welfare was\n\nendangered).\n\n\n\n\n      7\n          In his initial brief, plaintiff failed to challenge the\ndismissal of the § 1983 Fourth Amendment claims against the County\nand Sheriffs William Carter and Todd Brackett.      To the extent\nplaintiff makes this argument in his reply brief (and it is not\nclear that he has) he has waived the argument. See Hoult v. Hoult,\n373 F.3d 47, 54 (1st Cir. 2004) (arguments made for the first time\nin an appellant's reply brief are waived); Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co.,\n916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to on appeal\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed\nargumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\").\n\n                                    -23-\n\fC.            ADA Title      II    Claims       Against      Maine   and      Lincoln\n              County\n\n1.            Elements of an ADA Title II Claim\n\n              Before reaching the merits of plaintiff's ADA Title II\n\nclaims or Maine's Eleventh Amendment immunity defense, we describe\n\nTitle II.     The ADA itself has five titles, three of which are meant\n\nto eliminate in a distinct area discrimination against persons with\n\ndisabilities.         Title I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117,\n\naddresses      discrimination       by    employers       affecting      interstate\n\ncommerce; Title II, id. §§ 12131-12165, addresses discrimination by\n\ngovernmental      entities    in    the     operation     of    public     services,\n\nprograms, and activities, including transportation; and Title III,\n\nid.     §§    12181-12189,        addresses       discrimination         in   public\n\naccommodations and services operated by private entities.\n\n              Title II of the ADA provides, inter alia, that \"no\n\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\n\nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\n\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" Id.\n\n§    12132.     The   statute     defines       \"qualified     individual     with   a\n\ndisability\" as\n\n              an individual with a disability who, with or\n              without reasonable modifications to rules,\n              policies, or practices, the removal of\n              architectural,       communication,       or\n              transportation barriers, or the provision of\n              auxiliary aids and services, meets the\n              essential eligibility requirements for the\n\n                                         -24-\n\f            receipt of services or the participation in\n            programs or activities provided by a public\n            entity.\n\nId. § 12131(2).\n\n            To   prevail   on   a   Title   II   claim,   a    plaintiff   must\n\ndemonstrate:\n\n            (1) that he is a qualified individual with a\n            disability; (2) that he was either excluded\n            from participation in or denied the benefits\n            of some public entity's services, programs, or\n            activities or was otherwise discriminated\n            against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial\n            of benefits, or discrimination was by reason\n            of the plaintiff's disability.\n\nParker v. Universidad de Puerto Rico, 225 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n            It is not disputed that Buchanan was a person with a\n\ndisability.      The Title II dispute is over whether plaintiff has\n\nshown all three prongs, including that Buchanan was a qualified\n\nindividual.      We return to this topic after addressing the State's\n\nEleventh Amendment argument in response to the Title II claim.\n\n2.          Title II Claims Against Maine\n\n            The district court held that \"Title II of the ADA, as\n\napplied to access to public mental health services, does not\n\nvalidly abrogate the State's sovereign immunity and cannot be\n\nenforced against the State of Maine in a lawsuit for monetary\n\ndamages.\"     Buchanan, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 283.               Later, the court\n\nreaffirmed its previous ruling that Title II did not abrogate\n\nMaine's sovereign immunity; it also concluded that neither the AMHI\n\n                                     -25-\n\fconsent decree nor the settlement agreement waived the State's\n\nimmunity against suit.          Buchanan, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 40-41.          On\n\nthese grounds, the district court granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof Maine with respect to plaintiff's Title II claim.                Id. at 41.\n\na.          Maine's Eleventh Amendment Defense\n\n            We set the Eleventh Amendment issue in context.                 The\n\nEleventh Amendment ordinarily renders States immune from suits for\n\nmonetary relief in federal court by private citizens. See Seminole\n\nTribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996).                   Nonetheless,\n\nCongress    may    abrogate    States'      immunity   if   it    \"unequivocally\n\nexpressed its intent to abrogate that immunity\" and \"acted pursuant\n\nto a valid grant of constitutional authority.\"              Kimel v. Fla. Bd.\n\nof   Regents,     528   U.S.   62,   73    (2000).     Congress   unequivocally\n\nexpressed its intent in the ADA to abrogate the States' sovereign\n\nimmunity.   See 42 U.S.C. § 12202; Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509,\n\n518 (2004).     Congress's constitutional authority to do so rests on\n\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.               \"Congress can abrogate a\n\nState's sovereign immunity when it does so pursuant to a valid\n\nexercise of its power under [Section] 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nto enforce the substantive guarantees of that Amendment.\"                  Lane,\n\n541 U.S. at 518.\n\n            Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is an affirmative\n\ngrant of legislative power to Congress, see Kimel, 528 U.S. at 80,\n\nproviding Congress the \"authority both to remedy and to deter\n\n\n                                          -26-\n\fviolation of [Fourteenth Amendment] rights . . . by prohibiting a\n\nsomewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not\n\nitself forbidden by the Amendment's text.\"                  Id.; see also Nev.\n\nDep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 727 (2003).                        Under\n\nSection   5,   Congress    may   not       only   remedy   past     violations      of\n\nconstitutional rights, but also enact \"prophylactic legislation\n\nthat   proscribes   facially     constitutional          conduct,    in   order    to\n\nprevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.\"                 Hibbs, 538 U.S. at\n\n727-28.    Further,      Congress     may     prohibit     \"practices     that    are\n\ndiscriminatory in effect, if not in intent, to carry out the basic\n\nobjectives of the Equal Protection Clause.\" Lane, 541 U.S. at 520.\n\n           The mere invocation of Section 5 by Congress does not\n\nestablish that the legislation is constitutional. Legislation must\n\ndemonstrate \"a congruence and proportionality between the injury to\n\nbe prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\"                      City\n\nof Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997).                      In evaluating\n\nwhether    Title    II     is    an        appropriate      response      to      past\n\nunconstitutional treatment of individuals with disabilities, the\n\nSupreme Court in Lane declined to address Title II as a whole,\n\nupholding it instead as \"valid [Section] 5 legislation as it\n\napplies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of\n\njudicial services.\"       541 U.S. at 531.\n\n           Applying these principles, the district court held that\n\napplication    of   Title       II    to     plaintiff's     claims       would     be\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\funconstitutional under the Eleventh Amendment.                 We do not resolve\n\nthe merits of the Eleventh Amendment defense.               There is a protocol\n\nby    which    such    Eleventh    Amendment      claims   should       be   decided.\n\nApplying that protocol, we do not reach the merits of the Eleventh\n\nAmendment issue, nor should the district court have done so.                      Both\n\nMaine and the United States agree that before the immunity issue is\n\nreached, the court must first address whether plaintiff's Title II\n\nclaim fails on the merits.\n\nb.            Protocol For Deciding Eleventh Amendment Issues\n\n              Two related doctrines dictate the protocol to be used in\n\nanalyzing claims that, under the Eleventh Amendment, Title II may\n\nnot    be     constitutionally          applied   to    permit     suits       against\n\nunconsenting States even when Congress has clearly expressed its\n\nintention that States be subject to such suits.\n\n              The first is well known: the doctrine of constitutional\n\navoidance.       It is a \"fundamental and longstanding principle of\n\njudicial       restraint       that      courts   [should]       avoid       reaching\n\nconstitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding\n\nthem.\" Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439,\n\n445 (1988). Thus, \"prior to reaching any constitutional questions,\n\nfederal       courts    must    consider     nonconstitutional          grounds    for\n\ndecision.\"      Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 99 (1981) (citing\n\nAshwander      v.     Tenn.    Valley    Auth.,   297   U.S.     288,    347    (1936)\n\n(Brandeis, J., concurring)).\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f          The second doctrine stems from the recent Supreme Court\n\ndecision in United States v. Georgia, 126 S. Ct. 877 (2006), in\n\nwhich the Court set forth a step-by-step analysis for Title II\n\nclaims and explained that lower courts should\n\n          determine . . . on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which\n          aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II;\n          (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the\n          Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct\n          violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth\n          Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of\n          sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is\n          nevertheless valid.\n\nId. at 882.\n\n          Under Georgia, the court must determine in the first\n\ninstance, on a claim-by-claim basis, which aspects of the State's\n\nalleged conduct violated Title II.8   Id.   If the State's conduct\n\n\n     8\n          Eleventh Amendment immunity is meant to protect the State\nfrom being subject to suit at all. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at\n54.   Yet the Georgia protocol may require the State to defend\nlitigation before obtaining a ruling on immunity.        It may be\ndifficult in some instances to determine on motions under Rule\n12(b)(6) whether plaintiff's complaint stated a viable Title II\nclaim. That is so because of both the generous notice pleading\nrules in federal practice and the rule that no greater pleading\nrequirements are imposed on civil rights plaintiffs.            See\nLeatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination\nUnit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993); Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 31\n(1st Cir. 2006).    As a result, there may need to be further\nspecificity about the precise nature of the plaintiff's claims and\nsome discovery after the suit begins.           Title II may be\nconstitutional at least for claims \"against the States for conduct\nthat actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Georgia, 126 S.\nCt. at 882. This again demands some greater specificity as to the\nalleged Title II claims.\n          In Georgia, the plaintiff's pro se complaint had been\nsupplemented by numerous filings specifying more precisely the\nnature of his claims, some of which asserted Eighth Amendment\nviolations. Id. at 879-80. The Supreme Court ordered that the\n\n                               -29-\n\fdoes not violate Title II, the court does not proceed to the next\n\nstep in the analysis.   The claim ends.   Cf. Toledo v. Sánchez, 454\n\nF.3d 24, 31-40 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding a sufficient allegation\n\nthat the defendant had violated Title II, and thus proceeding with\n\nthe analysis).\n\n          In this case, the summary judgment record establishes\n\nthat there is no Title II claim against the State and, as a result,\n\nit was error for the district court to reach the Eleventh Amendment\n\nissue.   Judgment for the State of Maine, then, is affirmed on the\n\ngrounds that plaintiff failed to establish a violation of Title II,\n\nbut not on the grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nc.        There Was No Violation of Title II\n\n          For the reasons that follow, we hold that plaintiff has\n\nnot established a claim under Title II: (1) he has not shown that\n\nBuchanan was a qualified individual; (2) he has not shown that\n\nBuchanan was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits\n\nprovided by Maine, or that he was otherwise discriminated against;\n\nand (3) there is no evidence that the reason Maine did not provide\n\nsuch services as plaintiff says were due was \"by reason of [his]\n\ndisability.\"   See 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n\n\n\n\ncase be remanded so that its three-part test could be applied to an\namended complaint. Id. at 882. Justice Stevens, in a concurrence,\nnoted that the Court's opinion \"wisely permits the parties . . . to\ncreate a factual record that will inform [the Eleventh Amendment\nquestion].\" Id. (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n                                -30-\n\f           It is significant that this case does not raise the\n\nspecial    category   of   claims    about   deinstitutionalization   of\n\ninstitutionalized mentally ill patients.       See Olmstead v. Zimring,\n\n527 U.S. 581, 599-601 (1999); 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).       Buchanan was\n\nplaced in a community setting, which is one of the objectives of\n\nthe ADA.       See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(a)(2), (5) (describing the\n\nisolation and segregation of disabled individuals as a \"form[] of\n\ndiscrimination\" and \"a serious and pervasive social problem\").\n\n           While it is clear Buchanan was disabled, we initially\n\ndefer the question of whether he was a \"qualified individual.\" Id.\n\n§ 12131(2).9    The law has recognized certain guiding principles for\n\nADA claims asserting that the disabled are being denied medical or\n\nmental health treatment benefits.          One is that, generally, the\n\nState is not obligated to provide new programs or services to the\n\ndisabled which it has not previously provided to any group.           For\n\nexample, where New York did not provide safety-monitoring services\n\nto the physically disabled, the ADA did not compel the State to\n\nprovide such services to the mentally disabled.       Rodriguez v. City\n\nof New York, 197 F.3d 611, 618-19 (2d Cir. 1999).         Also, where a\n\nState did not already provide the vocational services sought by the\n\n\n\n     9\n          As several courts have pointed out, the very concept of\na \"qualified individual\" poses analytical difficulties on facts\nlike these, where a state provides services precisely because an\nindividual is disabled. Fitzgerald v. Corrs. Corp. of Am., 403\nF.3d 1134, 1144 (10th Cir. 2005); Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 82-\n83 (2d Cir. 1998).\n\n                                    -31-\n\fplaintiff, a claim of illegal discrimination under Title II was not\n\ncognizable.    See Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73, 83-84 (2d Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n            Although the ADA does not itself mandate the provision of\n\nservices, it does prohibit discrimination against the disabled\n\nwithin the services that are provided.           For example, in Olmstead,\n\nthe Supreme Court found there was a discrimination claim under the\n\nADA where Georgia had denied mentally disabled patients entry into\n\nexisting community-based treatment programs that were available to\n\nthe non-institutionalized mentally disabled.             527 U.S. at 607.\n\n            The Supreme Court has been clear about what the ADA does\n\nnot require.   The Olmstead Court said in response to the dissent's\n\nconcerns:\n\n            We do not in this opinion hold that the ADA\n            imposes on the States a \"standard of care\" for\n            whatever medical services they render, or that\n            the ADA requires States to \"provide a certain\n            level   of  benefits   to   individuals   with\n            disabilities.\"\n\n527 U.S. at 603 n.14 (citation omitted) (quoting id. at 623, 624\n\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (charging that \"the type of claim approved\n\nof by the majority does not concern a prohibition against certain\n\nconduct (the traditional understanding of discrimination), but\n\nrather concerns imposition of a standard of care\")).\n\n            Olmstead   also   held    that   a   State    may   rely   on   the\n\nreasonable assessment of its own professionals in determining\n\nwhether a patient meets the requirements for a particular treatment\n\n                                     -32-\n\fprogram.       Id. at 602.     That is because, in part, \"courts normally\n\nshould defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health\n\nofficials.\"      Sch. Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 288\n\n(1987).    We understand this to relate at least to the question of\n\nwhether a plaintiff is a \"qualified\" individual.\n\n               Further, the Olmstead Court held that the ADA does not\n\nrequire that a particular treatment be foisted on an unwilling\n\nparticipant.        Olmstead,     527    U.S.   at   602   (citing   28   C.F.R.\n\n§ 35.130(e)(1); id. pt. 35, App. A).             This is another aspect of\n\nwhether the plaintiff is a \"qualified\" individual.\n\n               The theme that the ADA does not set a standard of care\n\nfor services or require the States to provide a certain level of\n\nbenefits was sounded earlier in Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287\n\n(1985),    a    case   about    the   non-discrimination      aspects     of   the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973:\n\n               Medicaid programs do not guarantee that each\n               recipient will receive that level of health\n               care precisely tailored to his or her\n               particular needs. . . . [T]he benefit provided\n               remains the individual services offered -- not\n               \"adequate health care.\"\n\nId. at 303.      These tests have been routinely applied by the courts\n\nof appeals.      See Schiavo v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1289, 1300 (11th Cir.\n\n2005); Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 608 (7th Cir. 2004);\n\nTownsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 518 (9th Cir. 2003); Cercpac v.\n\nHealth & Hosps. Corp., 147 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he\n\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\f[Rehabilitation Act and ADA] do not guarantee any particular level\n\nof medical care for disabled persons . . . .\").\n\n             This circuit, in Kiman v. New Hampshire Department of\n\nCorrections, 451 F.3d 274 (1st Cir. 2006), has recognized the\n\ndistinction between ADA claims based on negligent medical care and\n\nthose based on discriminatory medical care.      Id. at 284; see also\n\nFitzgerald v. Corrs. Corp. of Am., 403 F.3d 1134, 1144 (10th Cir.\n\n2005) (\"[P]urely medical decisions . . . do not ordinarily fall\n\nwithin the scope of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.\"); Bryant v.\n\nMadigan, 84 F.3d 246, 249 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"The ADA does not create\n\na   remedy   for   medical   malpractice.\").   The   State   argues   that\n\nplaintiff's claim must fail because it merely alleges inadequate\n\nhealth care, which does not constitute a Title II violation.10\n\n\n\n\n      10\n          Maine also makes the argument that Title II \"mandate[s]\nonly that the services provided by [the defendant] to non-\nhandicapped individuals not be denied to a disabled person because\nhe is handicapped.\" Brief of Defendants/Appellees State of Maine\net al. at 40 (alterations in original) (quoting Pfrommer, 148 F.3d\nat 83) (internal quotation marks omitted). On this point, there is\ntension between Pfrommer and the Supreme Court's decision in\nOlmstead, 527 U.S. at 598 & n.10 (1999) (rejecting the argument\nthat \"discrimination\" does not encompass \"disparate treatment among\nmembers of the same protected class\" (quoting id. at 616 (Thomas,\nJ., dissenting))).\n          At oral argument, the United States disagreed with\nMaine's argument and argued that a Title II violation would indeed\noccur if a public entity decided to make benefits available only to\ndisabled individuals but then proceeded to distribute those\nbenefits only to those disabled people who could access an\nadministrative office on the second floor of a building lacking\nwheelchair ramps or elevators.     We do not address the abstract\nquestion.\n\n                                   -34-\n\f             By the time of the summary judgment motions, plaintiff's\n\nclaim came down to specifics that demonstrated that the claim was\n\nnot about discriminatory denial of services, but rather about the\n\nadequacy of treatment.          When asked to identify the particular\n\nservices that Buchanan was denied and how that denial constituted\n\ndiscrimination under the ADA, plaintiff asserted that Joel Gilbert\n\n\"did nothing to enable [Buchanan] to understand his mental health\n\nproblems or assist him to understand and to obtain the help he\n\nneeded to continue to live with some independence and dignity in\n\nthe community.\"     When asked to list the reasonable accommodations\n\nthat should have been provided to Buchanan, plaintiff stated that\n\nGilbert should have (1) made weekly check-ups, (2) performed\n\nadditional medical check-ups, (3) amended Buchanan's service plan\n\nto reflect his increasing needs, and (4) provided assistance and\n\ncrisis intervention when he received Johnston's phone call on\n\nFebruary 25, 2002.       Plaintiff asserts Buchanan was denied an ISP.\n\n             The record is uncontested that Maine, through Gilbert,\n\ndid   make   regular    check-ups,    did      attempt    to    meet       Buchanan's\n\nincreasing     needs,    and    did      provide     assistance           and   crisis\n\nintervention.    There is no viable claim that Maine did not provide\n\nmental health services to the disabled, and there is no viable\n\nclaim   that   Maine    did    provide    services       to    the   disabled      but\n\ndiscriminated    among    categories      of   the   disabled        in    doing   so.\n\nFurther, under Olmstead, plaintiff has not shown the State's\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\ftreatment professionals determined these additional services were\n\nrequired, see 527 U.S. at 603, nor does plaintiff offer any expert\n\ntestimony that they were necessary.\n\n           As to the argument that the State failed to provide\n\nBuchanan an ISP, Buchanan repeatedly declined to participate in the\n\nISP process as envisioned by the AMHI settlement agreement.11           On\n\nOctober 7, 1999, in his first meeting with Gilbert, Buchanan was\n\n\"not interested in receiving services.\"        On March 1, June 8, and\n\nSeptember 13 of 2000, state employee Donald Beckwith spoke with\n\nBuchanan   about   creating   an   ISP.   On   each   occasion,   Buchanan\n\nrefused.   On four more occasions between December 12, 2000 and\n\nDecember 12, 2001, Buchanan declined offers from Gilbert to set up\n\na treatment plan.      Here, the ISP was \"opposed by the affected\n\nindividual.\"   Id. at 587.\n\n           There is also no evidence that Buchanan was either\n\ndiscriminated against or not provided the additional services the\n\nplaintiff seeks \"by reason of\" his disability.             See Forestier\n\nFradera v. Municipality of Mayagüez, 440 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Parker, 225 F.3d at 5.\n\n           Finally, we address the question raised by this court's\n\ncase law, both under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and under the\n\n\n\n     11\n          Under the settlement agreement, \"[c]lass members have the\nright to refuse all or some of the services offered,\" subject to\ncertain    exceptions    involving    issues    like   involuntary\nhospitalizations and incapacity to consent.\n\n                                   -36-\n\fADA, that there is a limited basis for a challenge to medical\n\ntreatment decisions if and only if the challenge is framed within\n\na larger theory of disability discrimination.          See Kiman, 451 F.3d\n\nat 284-85; Lesley v. Chie, 250 F.3d 47, 55 (1st Cir. 2001).                We\n\nhave described two situations in which a challenge based on a\n\ntreatment decision might be made: (1) the treatment decision was so\n\nunreasonable     as   to   be   arbitrary   and   capricious,   raising    an\n\nimplication of pretext for some discriminatory motive, and (2) if\n\nnot pretextual, the treatment decision was based on stereotypes of\n\nthe disabled rather than an individualized inquiry as to the\n\nplaintiff's conditions.         Kiman, 451 F.3d at 284-85.        There was\n\nnothing unreasonable about the treatment decisions in this case and\n\ncertainly   no   stereotyping,     so   neither   of   these   arguments   is\n\navailable.12\n\n            On these facts, judgment for Maine should be entered on\n\nthe grounds that no Title II claim has been established.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n          While we need not reach the reasonable accommodation\narguments, the plaintiff has made no showing that the State, taking\ninto account the needs of others with mental disabilities, had the\navailable resources to do what plaintiff suggests was required. In\nfact, as to the weekly visit claim, Gilbert had planned on regular\nmeetings with Buchanan but sensibly, in light of Buchanan's\nbehavior on December 28, 2001, wanted to have a co-worker with him.\nAlthough Gilbert tried to visit Buchanan twice in January 2002, he\ncould not find a co-worker to go with him. So Gilbert tried to\nkeep tabs on Buchanan with the help of a private citizen.\n\n                                    -37-\n\f3.         Title II Claims Against Lincoln County\n\n           Plaintiff argues the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment to Lincoln County on his Title II claim.                He\n\nargues that the County failed to reasonably accommodate Buchanan's\n\ndisability   by   (1)   failing    to   draft   law   enforcement   policies\n\naccommodating the needs of mentally ill members of the public, and\n\n(2) failing to adequately train its officers on the needs of the\n\nmentally ill public.\n\n           On appeal, plaintiff argues that the district court\n\nmisunderstood his Title II claim as asserting that Title II of the\n\nADA governs how persons are taken into custody and prohibits\n\narrests based on misperceptions caused by disability.          He disavows\n\nthose theories as factually inappropriate, and he says the court's\n\nanalysis \"is misplaced.\"13        His point, he argues, is that the law\n\nrequires     sufficient     training       of    officers     to    prevent\n\nmiscommunication.\n\n           We bypass the question of whether Title II of the ADA\n\nimposes duties on a county sheriff's department to draft policies\n\nand train officers on the needs of the mentally ill public.\n\n\n     13\n          Accordingly, we do not address the district court's\nanalysis, see Buchanan, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 72-73, relying on Hainze\nv. Richards, 207 F.3d 795, 802 (5th Cir. 2000); Gohier v. Enright,\n186 F.3d 1216, 1220-21 (10th Cir. 1999); and Lewis v. Truitt, 960\nF. Supp. 175, 178-79 (S.D. Ind. 1997). It is questionable whether\nthe ADA was intended to impose any requirements on police entering\na residence to take someone into protective or other custody beyond\nthe reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment, described\nearlier.\n\n                                    -38-\n\fWhether obliged to do so by Title II or not, the County did in fact\n\nhave such policies and such training.\n\n            The Lincoln County Sheriff's Department drafted a policy\n\ntitled \"Response to Deviant Behavior\" on November 20, 1995.                   That\n\npolicy went into effect on December 15, 1995 and specifically\n\naddresses issues concerning mentally ill persons.                   The document\n\nstates that \"[i]t shall be the policy of this agency to assist\n\npersons who are exhibiting symptoms of deviant behavior and appear\n\nto represent an imminent danger to themselves or to someone else.\"\n\nThe stated purpose of the policy is \"[t]o describe deviant behavior\n\nand circumstances under which police personnel will make an arrest\n\nor protective detention in order to assist said person or protect\n\nthe general public.\"       Furthermore, Deputies Emerson and Hatch were\n\ntrained on the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department Policies on both\n\n\"Response to Deviant Behavior\" and \"Use of Force.\"                   Emerson and\n\nHatch    also   received   additional    training     with    respect    to    the\n\nidentification of mentally ill persons and methods to employ when\n\ndealing with such persons.\n\n            Plaintiff contends that the policies put in place by the\n\nCounty    and   the   training   received    by    Emerson    and    Hatch    were\n\ndeficient.      In particular, plaintiff takes issue with the lack of\n\nprocedures      and   training   to   assist      officers   in     successfully\n\ncommunicating with mentally ill individuals.                 An argument that\n\npolice training, which was provided, was insufficient does not\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\fpresent a viable claim that Buchanan was \"denied the benefits of\n\nthe services . . . of a public entity\" by reason of his mental\n\nillness, as required under 42 U.S.C. § 12132.14\n\nD.          Section 1983 Claim Against Case Manager Gilbert\n\n            On the equal protection \"class of one\" claim, plaintiff\n\nargues that Gilbert intentionally denied critical intensive case\n\nmanagement to Buchanan while providing that service to other high-\n\nrisk mental health clients living in a community setting.                He also\n\nargues that Buchanan did not receive the services to which he was\n\nentitled under the AMHI consent decree while others did get such\n\nservices.       Our prior analysis largely takes care of this issue, but\n\nwe go on to discuss plaintiff's claim in the equal protection\n\nframework, which is different from the ADA method of analysis.\n\n            Plaintiff's      broad      equal      protection       claims    are\n\ninsufficient; the more specific claim is that Buchanan did not\n\nreceive a team-produced ISP, while other high-risk patients did.\n\nFrom this, plaintiff argues, one must necessarily conclude the\n\nreason    for    the   difference    was   that    Gilbert   felt    animus   for\n\nBuchanan.\n\n            We     repeat   the     district      court's    entirely    correct\n\nexplanation of the law with respect to \"class of one\" claims:\n\n\n\n\n     14\n          This case does not present any question of effective\ncommunication with hearing-impaired persons in emergency treatment\nsituations. See 34 C.F.R. § 104.52(c).\n\n                                      -40-\n\f            A \"class of one\" equal protection claim exists\n            \"where the plaintiff alleges that [he] has\n            been intentionally treated differently from\n            others similarly situated and that there is no\n            rational   basis    for   the   difference   in\n            treatment.\" While the United States Supreme\n            Court has recognized the propriety of \"class\n            of one\" equal protection claims, the viability\n            of such a claim depends upon a showing that\n            the   plaintiff   was   intentionally   treated\n            differently than others similarly situated.\n\nBuchanan, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 37 (alteration in original) (citation\n\nand footnote omitted) (quoting Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528\n\nU.S. 562, 564,(2000)).        In general terms, a plaintiff not relying\n\non \"typical\" impermissible categories, such as race or religion,\n\nmust show that he was intentionally treated differently from others\n\nsimilarly   situated,    that    no   rational    basis   exists   for   that\n\ndifference in treatment, and that the different treatment was based\n\non a malicious or bad faith intent to injure.              See Tapalian v.\n\nTusino, 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The district court correctly held that there was no\n\nevidence    Buchanan    had    been   treated    differently   from   others\n\nsimilarly situated.     See Buchanan, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 38 (finding\n\nno evidence showing that Buchanan was treated differently from\n\nGilbert's other clients or AMHI class members enrolled in the\n\nIntensive Case Management program).          \"Plaintiffs claiming an equal\n\nprotection violation must first 'identify and relate specific\n\ninstances where persons situated similarly in all relevant aspects\n\nwere treated differently, instances which have the capacity to\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fdemonstrate that [plaintiffs] were singled . . . out for unlawful\n\noppression.'\"        Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60 F.3d 906, 910 (1st Cir.\n\n1995)       (alteration   and   omission    in     original)   (emphasis   added)\n\n(quoting Dartmouth Review v.

Hernández, 367 F.3d 61 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).\n\n               Plaintiff has failed to show any \"specific instances\"\n\ninvolving similarly situated individuals -- that is, clients who\n\nhad severe mental health problems similar to Buchanan's, who had\n\ndeclined to participate in the ISP process, but who nevertheless\n\nreceived team-produced ISPs.         Instead, plaintiff broadly refers to\n\nwell over four-hundred pages of the record as supporting the\n\nplaintiff's general claim that \"high-risk mental health clients\n\nreceived a team produced [ISP] where as [sic] Michael Buchanan\n\ndidn't.\"        It is true that an exact correlation need not exist\n\nbetween a plaintiff's situation and that of others in order to make\n\na \"similarly situated\" comparison, see Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d\n\nat 19, but plaintiff's claim is far from adequate.\n\n               As is clear from our discussion, Gilbert was entitled to\n\nsummary judgment because plaintiff failed to establish a viable\n\nequal protection claim.15\n\n\n       15\n          Plaintiff consented to summary judgment in favor of\nGilbert's supervisor, Julianne Edmondson, on his equal protection\nclaim.

Plaintiff further made the constitutional claim that Buchanan's case manager, Joel Gilbert, and Gilbert's supervisor, Julianne Edmondson, violated Buchanan's \"class of one\" equal protection rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State of Maine asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity to the plaintiff's ADA Title II claim.

Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2000). Issues of law are reviewed de novo. <i>Cotter v. Mass. Ass'n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers,</i> 219 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed, except as otherwise noted. Michael Buchanan was born in 1940 and moved to Maine in approximately 1978. Buchanan had shown signs of mental illness since the early 1970s. He was involuntarily committed to the Augusta Mental Health Institute (AMHI) on two separate occasions. The first admission was in 1988, and the second admission lasted from September 11, 1999 to October 19, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time there was litigation in the state courts over whether Maine, \"in its ... provision of treatment and services to present and former patients of AMHI,\" was violating the state and federal constitutions as well as state and federal laws. <i>Bates v. Dep't of Behavioral &amp; Developmental Servs.,</i> 863 A.2d 890, 894 (Me. 2004). In 1990, the parties settled the class action lawsuit by an agreement and consent decree in which Maine did not admit liability, and in which the State was to provide certain health care services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Every class member, generally, upon discharge from AMHI was entitled to receive an Individualized Support Plan (ISP) assessing the class member's strengths and needs, describing the class member's goals and objectives, and listing the services the class member needed to meet his or her goals and objectives. These individualized plans were to be \"coordinated and monitored by a community support worker\" who was then responsible for locating and delivering the needed services. Buchanan was a member of this class, as he was discharged from AMHI in October 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1999, while at AMHI, Buchanan was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychosis, schizo-affective disorder, and schizophrenia with paranoia. He was discharged on October 19, 1999, having been prescribed three medications: lithium, Haldol, and Cogentin. Buchanan was assigned to Joel Gilbert, an intensive case manager with three years of experience in that position. As an intensive case manager, Gilbert was a community support worker who was responsible for helping mental health clients live independently in the community. Gilbert described his job as helping clients obtain mental health services, as well as any other services they might need, such as housing assistance, welfare benefits, medical care, and fuel assistance. In the community support program, he handled the cases of ten to twelve high-risk patients who were seriously mentally ill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next month and a half in 1999, Gilbert visited Buchanan's house about once a week to check up on him. The house was located at the end of a one-half- to three-quarter-mile driveway that was frequently impassable by a regular vehicle. On a number of Gilbert's visits, Buchanan told Gilbert that he did not want to participate in the ISP process. The plaintiff maintains that Gilbert did not properly engage Buchanan in developing an ISP. It is uncontested that on December 2, 1999, Gilbert completed an \"outreach plan\" for Buchanan, under which Gilbert would make weekly visits to Buchanan to check on his living conditions, offer rides to town for errands, take him to doctor's appointments, and encourage him to take his medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert continued to visit Buchanan over the next two years. He took Buchanan grocery shopping at least eleven times. Gilbert took Buchanan to see the doctor at least eight times, picked up and delivered prescription drugs for Buchanan, took Buchanan to get fitted for glasses, and attended a dentist's appointment with Buchanan. Gilbert obtained state funds to purchase a wood stove and a propane heating system for Buchanan's home, as well as a watch so that Buchanan would know when to go out to the main road to be picked up by Gilbert. On two occasions, Gilbert also helped Buchanan fill out food stamp applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff asserts that, beginning in early 2001, Buchanan, after previously announcing that he would no longer take his medications, began to demonstrate signs of psychological decompensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is agreed that on December 28, 2001, Gilbert went to Buchanan's home to take him to a fuel assistance appointment. Buchanan accused Gilbert of shutting off his gas and became angry with Gilbert, claiming to have five gun permits and telling Gilbert he did not trust him. Gilbert told Buchanan he could not take him to his fuel assistance appointment in such a condition. According to Gilbert's written report, Buchanan waved his arms, made profane statements, and went back into his house stating, \"Don't come back here later, I don't want any[ ]more help, and don't bring those sheriffs here anymore either.\" As a result of this interaction, Gilbert believed it would be prudent to have a co-worker accompany him on any future visits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three days later, on December 31, 2001, Gilbert and a co-worker visited Buchanan's home. Buchanan was polite and did not appear to remember his angry interaction with Gilbert. This was Gilbert's last visit to Buchanan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert attempted to visit Buchanan twice in January 2002, but both times was unable to find a co-worker to accompany him. On February 5, 2002, Gilbert called Buchanan's brother Daniel to explain that he had been having difficulty making visits because Buchanan \"ha[d] become angry with [his] support.\" Gilbert did say that he had been keeping watch over Buchanan through Terry Johnston, Buchanan's neighbor and friend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 2002, Johnston called Gilbert to report that Buchanan had growled and glared at her that morning, and that around 4:30 p.m. the same day, she had learned that someone resembling Buchanan had been spotted lighting a fire in her woodpile. Gilbert told Johnston that the fire was a criminal matter and that she should call the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining facts are pertinent particularly for plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim. Because Buchanan was killed, there is no dispute with respect to most of the facts surrounding the events after the deputies arrived at his house. We have only the account of the deputies. In limited respects, as described later, plaintiff offers a somewhat different version based either on speculation or on inference from physical facts such as the autopsy results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnston took Gilbert's advice and called the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department at approximately 5:11 p.m. on February 25, 2002, asking that officers perform a welfare check on Buchanan. Deputy Kenneth Hatch was assigned to respond to Johnston's call. Johnston told Hatch that she had contacted Buchanan's counselor about her concerns, and that Gilbert had said he would check on Buchanan the following day. She also told Hatch that although she did not wish to pursue any criminal charges, she was afraid Buchanan might light her barn on fire. After speaking with Johnston, Hatch asked Deputy Robert Emerson to accompany him to Buchanan's home. Another officer informed Hatch that Buchanan had a serious mental illness. The deputies had not had any prior dealings with Buchanan. In response to Johnston's request, the two officers promptly went out to Buchanan's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 5:59 p.m., in the winter dark, the deputies arrived at Buchanan's unplowed, snow-covered access road and set off on foot to reach the house. The house was approximately thirty-six feet long and twenty-four feet wide, and had a \"daylight basement\" with a single story over the basement. The deputies walked outside the house to the area where lights were on in the upstairs of the house. Hatch knocked on the door leading into the basement several times, but there was no response. Emerson saw Buchanan walk to the window on the long side of the house. Buchanan appeared to be screaming something, but Emerson could not hear what he was saying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan then walked to a window on the short side of the house, and pushed it open. Buchanan screamed out the window that he worked for the Massachusetts Sheriff's Department; he also said, \"You are not throwing me in a Nazi Jewish oven.\" Emerson yelled, \"Michael, are you okay? We are here to check on you.\" Buchanan answered that the deputies were not there to check on him, and then he started screaming about being with the New York State Police, that he was with the federal government, and that he had the right to sell guns. Buchanan also said something about \"not having any fires.\" Emerson yelled to Hatch and asked if he saw any fires. Hatch walked around the house, looking for open fires in or around the building. He found none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson explained to Buchanan that they only wanted to talk to him, but Buchanan said \"No\" and that they were trying to get \"Evelyn\" after him. Buchanan told the deputies to get off his property, to go back to the main road, and that he was going to kill them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan walked away from the window, then reappeared and threw some liquid at Emerson. Emerson managed to avoid being hit by most of the liquid, which smelled of liquor. Emerson thought that Buchanan was \"beyond agitated\" and seemed upset with the officers for reasons wholly unrelated to the stated purpose of their visit. Buchanan then shut the window, turned off the light in the room, went to the other side of the house, and turned lights on there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 6:20 p.m., while Emerson was still trying to talk with Buchanan, Hatch radioed dispatch to advise the officer of the situation and asked him to get in touch with Buchanan's mental health counselor to see what he advised. About one minute later, Hatch was told that Gilbert's line was busy; he instructed the officer to break through the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a loud smashing sound, which Emerson thought might be a gunshot; Hatch told Emerson that he was unsure but believed the noise was that of a window breaking. At approximately 6:24 p.m., after hearing the noise of shattering glass, Hatch spoke to dispatch and requested that the on-call supervisor be contacted and advised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Hatch did not tell Emerson that he had called the supervisor for advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan walked down the stairs of his home and appeared at the basement door. Emerson could see that the knuckles on at least one of Buchanan's hands were bloody. Emerson thought that Buchanan had put his fist through glass, and that this explained the earlier smashing sound. Buchanan opened the door and began screaming at Emerson and swearing about the \"warrants.\" Emerson explained in a soft voice that the deputies were only at Buchanan's house to talk to him. Buchanan spit on Emerson, hitting the deputy on his chest. Emerson continued to speak to Buchanan in a quiet, calm voice. Buchanan then turned and walked back into the house. We take these facts as the deputies recount them because plaintiff has offered no contrary facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson followed Buchanan into the house. Buchanan, who was on the second or third step of the staircase, spit at Emerson again. In his incident report, Emerson explained that by this time he had decided that even though Buchanan had committed several criminal acts, Emerson's thoughts were not to arrest Buchanan, but that it would be best to put Buchanan in protective custody and have him evaluated, because Emerson believed Buchanan was in an unstable mental state. Emerson listed Buchanan's agitated condition, his nonsensical screaming, and his apparently self-inflicted injuries as reasons why he believed putting Buchanan into protective custody was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch came to the door and saw a \"spot of blood\" on one of Buchanan's hands. Buchanan was again yelling and screaming, with his hands on the railing of the staircase. Emerson observed that there was fresh blood on Buchanan's hands, and although there wasn't \"a lot\" of blood, there was a \"substantial\" amount of blood. Emerson attempted to grab both of Buchanan's hands to subdue him, but Buchanan pulled his hands back, spit at Emerson a third time, and started up the basement stairs. Emerson followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan went into a room and then returned to the top of the basement stairs, now carrying a knife. By this time, Deputy Emerson was almost at the top of the staircase, and Deputy Hatch was on the third or fourth step. Buchanan grabbed Emerson, and Emerson in turn attempted to reach for the knife. Buchanan grabbed Emerson's back and pushed him down against the stairs. Emerson screamed \"knife\" as Buchanan stabbed Emerson in the back of the shoulder. Emerson screamed for Hatch's help. Hatch drew his gun; Buchanan looked at Hatch as he continued to stab Emerson and did not stop. Hatch fired, but Buchanan stabbed Emerson at least two more times in the back and more times in the back of the head.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Hatch then repeatedly shot Buchanan until Buchanan fell over the railing on the stairs to the floor below. Hatch had hit Buchanan a total of four times. The first shot had hit Buchanan on the left side of his skull; the second, third, and fourth shots had all entered the left side of Buchanan's neck. The wounds were fatal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Summary Judgment Standard</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

Law enforcement officers may make warrantless entries \"when they reasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid.\" <i>Mincey v.

Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), this circuit uses a three-part test when evaluating a question of qualified immunity. \"In a suit against an officer for an alleged violation of a constitutional right, the requisites of a qualified immunity defense must be considered in proper sequence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151. The court \"generally [should] address first the question whether at some abstract level the plaintiffs have asserted a violation of constitutional rights, second whether those rights are clearly established, and third whether a reasonable officer could have concluded that his actions did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\" <i>Tremblay v. McClellan,</i> 350 F.3d 195, 199 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that there were no extenuating circumstances to justify the officers' decision to enter Buchanan's house without a warrant when they did, that no reasonable officer would have thought there were such circumstances, and that the entry inevitably led to Buchanan's death. According to plaintiff, Buchanan's odd behavior and ranting did not justify entry into the house. In fact, plaintiff argues, Buchanan made it clear that he wanted the deputies to leave, and had the officers done so, Buchanan would be alive today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff also argues that Buchanan posed no threat to himself. The cut on his hand, as the autopsy photos showed, was not serious. Nor did Buchanan pose any threat to anyone else. Furthermore, Buchanan did not provoke anyone: it was the officers who came to Buchanan and made him feel threatened, particularly when they entered Buchanan's house after he made it plain they should leave. Plaintiff argues that a reasonable officer would have waited outside Buchanan's house before making such a precipitous entry. After all, plaintiff argues, Hatch had asked the dispatch officer to contact Gilbert for advice on how to proceed. Hatch should have waited to get that advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no material disputes of fact, only disagreement about the conclusions to be drawn. The district court held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the merits, and that whether or not Hatch and Emerson <i>had</i> violated Buchanan's Fourth Amendment rights, the deputies would nonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Buchanan,</i> 417 F.Supp.2d at 57-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the first step of the immunity analysis, if we were to look only at the <i>allegations</i> in plaintiff's complaint, then we would conclude that the plaintiff has asserted a constitutional right to be free from warrantless entry in the absence of extenuating circumstances. The question becomes more complicated when there has been development of facts and a summary judgment record is before the court. We addressed that situation in <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55 (1st Cir. 2004):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, qualified immunity is brought at the summary judgment stage, the inquiry on the first prong is somewhat different. The language in <i>Saucier</i> is ambiguous on this point; the case refers both to \"the facts alleged\" and to the \"parties' submissions.\" But subsequent Supreme Court cases have clarified, implicitly if not explicitly, that courts assessing the first prong at summary judgment should look beyond the complaint to the broader summary judgment record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 61-62 (citation omitted) (quoting <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We noted that there was some flexibility in the application of the first prong, and that <i>Saucier</i> itself suggested that the law elaboration function of the first prong would be well served only in \"appropriate cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62 (quoting <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 207, 121 S.Ct. 2151) (internal quotation marks omitted). We also observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n some cases, such as where the claim depends on a \"kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed,\" the law elaboration function is not well served and thus the <i>Saucier</i> rule may not strictly apply. Moreover, the level of specificity at which the first prong is analyzed may change depending on a given inquiry's utility in further elaborating the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (citation omitted) (quoting <i>Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,</i> 315 F.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2002)). In <i>Riverdale,</i> we did not address, on the first prong, the question of Fourth Amendment reasonableness, but rather the antecedent question of law as to whether there had been a \"search.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think the law elaboration purpose will be well served here, where the Fourth Amendment question is a reasonableness question which is highly idiosyncratic and heavily dependent on the facts. The question is close whether under normal summary judgment rules, drawing all inferences in plaintiff's favor, this record would preclude submission to the jury of the question whether, given the circumstances, the officers reasonably entered Buchanan's house <i>when they did</i> rather than wait to see if they could break through a busy phone line to ask Buchanan's social worker for advice. On summary judgment on qualified immunity, the threshold question is whether all the uncontested facts and any contested facts looked at in plaintiff's favor show a constitutional violation. <i>Burke v. Town of Walpole,</i> 405 F.3d 66, 77 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>see also Perez v. Oakland County,</i> 466 F.3d 416, 426-27 (6th Cir. 2006). Given the complexity of the matter, and since it is perfectly clear that the officers are entitled to immunity, we turn to the second and third prongs. <i>Cf. Brosseau v. Haugen,</i> 543 U.S. 194, 198, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (expressing no view on correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision on constitutional question, but reaching remaining prongs of immunity analysis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the deputies' visit to Buchanan's home, it had been clearly established that \"a warrantless entry ... of a residence may be `reasonable,' in Fourth Amendment terms,\" but was not reasonable unless \"the government [could] demonstrate ... `exigent circumstances,'\" such as \"an imminent threat to the life or safety of members of the public, the police officers, or a person located within the residence.\" <i>McCabe v. Life-Line Ambulance Serv., Inc.,</i> 77 F.3d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing <i>United States v. Tibolt,</i> 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1995); <i>Hegarty v. Somerset County,</i> 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st Cir. 1995)); <i>see also Brigham City v. Stuart,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1947, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006) (\"[L]aw enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.\" (citing <i>Mincey,</i> 437 U.S. at 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408)); <i>Welsh v.

The relevant inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct would be unlawful in the situation he confronted, and this inquiry must be taken in light of the case's specific context, not as a broad general proposition. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151. We cannot say the officers had fair warning under the law that if they entered the house when they did, they would violate Buchanan's Fourth Amendment rights. While there is no case directly on point, case law tended to support the officers' actions, not put them on notice of illegality. <i>Cf. Anthony v. City of New York,</i> 339 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir. 2003) (qualified immunity affirmed for officers who made warrantless entry to apartment of mentally ill woman who claimed to be under attack).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third prong of the qualified immunity analysis recognizes that \"law enforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but mistakenly conclude that [their conduct] is . . . lawful\"; \"in such cases those officials&#8212;like other officials who act in ways they reasonably believe to be lawful&#8212;should not be held personally liable.\" <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Even if we were wrong in our analysis thus far, the deputies would be entitled to immunity on the third prong. Our inquiry at this stage is limited to those objective facts known to (or discernible by) the officers at the time of the event. <i>Tibolt,</i> 72 F.3d at 969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson and Hatch argue that they reasonably believed their actions were lawful and were authorized by Maine's protective custody statute, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe, based upon probable cause, that a person may be mentally ill and that due to that condition the person presents a threat of imminent and substantial physical harm to that person or to other persons, . . . the law enforcement officer . . .

The deputies certainly had reasonable grounds to believe that Buchanan was mentally ill. Hatch had been informed of this fact by another officer, and the call from Johnston gave rise to suspicion. The phone call was not from an anonymous caller, and Johnston directly asked that the deputies check on Buchanan; Deputy Hatch also knew that Johnston had just spoken with Buchanan's mental health counselor, who was planning on visiting Buchanan the next day. Moreover, Buchanan's own behavior, discussed earlier, clearly confirmed his mental illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deputies also had reasonable grounds to believe that Buchanan presented a threat of imminent and substantial physical harm to himself or others, including the deputies themselves. The cut on Buchanan's hand, caused by his punching out a window, need not have been life threatening for the officers to have been justified in entering the house. <i>See Brigham City,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1947 (citing <i>Mincey,</i> 437 U.S. at 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to risk to others: Buchanan had threatened to kill Emerson and Hatch; he had thrown liquid at Emerson; he had spit at Emerson three times; someone matching his description had been spotted attempting to light a fire in his neighbor's woodpile; and the neighbor was afraid Buchanan would burn down her barn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable officer could have believed that waiting was not a good idea. There was no assurance the deputies could reach the social worker or that he would have been able to calm Buchanan or provide meaningful help to the officers from his remote location. Plaintiff put on no evidence that a reasonable officer would have waited. Further, the situation was escalating, with Buchanan punching out a window on a cold night, and the deputies did not know that the social worker would be available once the phone line was cleared. Even if the officers were mistaken, this was a reasonable judgment call, and they are entitled to immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See Tremblay,</i> 350 F.3d at 200-01 (finding qualified immunity on third prong for officer who took into protective custody a teenager when it was reasonable to suspect youth's person or welfare was endangered).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>ADA Title II Claims Against Maine and Lincoln County</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Elements of an ADA Title II Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching the merits of plaintiff's ADA Title II claims or Maine's Eleventh Amendment immunity defense, we describe Title II.

On these grounds, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Maine with respect to plaintiff's Title II claim. <i>Id.</i> at 41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Maine's Eleventh Amendment Defense</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the Eleventh Amendment issue in context. The Eleventh Amendment ordinarily renders States immune from suits for monetary relief in federal court by private citizens. <i>See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,</i> 517 U.S. 44, 54, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996). Nonetheless, Congress may abrogate States' immunity if it \"unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate that immunity\" and \"acted pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.\" <i>Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents,</i> 528 U.S. 62, 73, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000). Congress unequivocally expressed its intent in the ADA to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12202; <i>Tennessee v. Lane,</i> 541 U.S. 509, 518, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004). Congress's constitutional authority to do so rests on Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. \"Congress can abrogate a State's sovereign immunity when it does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under [Section] 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the substantive guarantees of that Amendment.\" <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 518, 124 S.Ct. 1978.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is an affirmative grant of legislative power to Congress, <i>see Kimel,</i> 528 U.S. at 80, 120 S.Ct. 631, providing Congress the \"authority both to remedy and to deter violation of [Fourteenth Amendment] rights ... by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text.\" <i>Id.; see also Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. 721, 727, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003). Under Section 5, Congress may not only remedy past violations of constitutional rights, but also enact \"prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct, in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct.\" <i>Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. at 727-28, 123 S.Ct. 1972. Further, Congress may prohibit \"practices that are discriminatory in effect, if not in intent, to carry out the basic objectives of the Equal Protection Clause.\" <i>Lane,</i> 541 U.S. at 520, 124 S.Ct. 1978.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere invocation of Section 5 by Congress does not establish that the legislation is constitutional. Legislation must demonstrate \"a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" <i>City of Boerne v. Flores,</i> 521 U.S. 507, 520, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997). In evaluating whether Title II is an appropriate response to past unconstitutional treatment of individuals with disabilities, the Supreme Court in <i>Lane</i> declined to address Title II as a whole, upholding it instead as \"valid [Section] 5 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services.\" 541 U.S. at 531, 124 S.Ct. 1978.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles, the district court held that application of Title II to plaintiff's claims would be unconstitutional under the Eleventh Amendment. We do not resolve the merits of the Eleventh Amendment defense. There is a protocol by which such Eleventh Amendment claims should be decided. Applying that protocol, we do not reach the merits of the Eleventh Amendment issue, nor should the district court have done so. Both Maine and the United States agree that before the immunity issue is reached, the court must first address whether plaintiff's Title II claim fails on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Protocol For Deciding Eleventh Amendment Issues</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two related doctrines dictate the protocol to be used in analyzing claims that, under the Eleventh Amendment, Title II may not be constitutionally applied to permit suits against unconsenting States even when Congress has clearly expressed its intention that States be subject to such suits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first is well known: the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. It is a \"fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint that courts [should] avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\" <i>Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n,</i> 485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988). Thus, \"prior to reaching any constitutional questions, federal courts must consider nonconstitutional grounds for decision.\" <i>Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard,</i> 452 U.S. 89, 99, 101 S.Ct. 2193, 68 L.Ed.2d 693 (1981) (citing <i>Ashwander v. Tenn. Valley Auth.,</i> 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second doctrine stems from the recent Supreme Court decision in <i>United States v. Georgia,</i> 546 U.S. 151, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006), in which the Court set forth a step-by-step analysis for Title II claims and explained that lower courts should</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">determine ... on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 882.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Georgia,</i> the court must determine in the first instance, on a claim-by-claim basis, which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> If the State's conduct does not violate Title II, the court does not proceed to the next step in the analysis. The claim ends. <i>Cf. Toledo v.

Judgment for the State of Maine, then, is affirmed on the grounds that plaintiff failed to establish a violation of Title II, but not on the grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>There Was No Violation of Title II</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that plaintiff has not established a claim under Title II: (1) he has not shown that Buchanan was a qualified individual; (2) he has not shown that Buchanan was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits provided by Maine, or that he was otherwise discriminated against; and (3) he has not shown that Maine's failure to provide such services as plaintiff says were due was \"by reason of [his] disability.\" <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that this case does not raise the special category of claims about deinstitutionalization of institutionalized mentally ill patients. <i>See Olmstead v. Zimring,</i> 527 U.S. 581, 599-601, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999); 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(d). Buchanan was placed in a community setting, which is one of the objectives of the ADA. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(a)(2), (5) (describing the isolation and segregation of disabled individuals as a \"form[] of discrimination\" and \"a serious and pervasive social problem\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is clear Buchanan was disabled, we initially defer the question of whether he was a \"qualified individual.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12131(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The law has recognized certain guiding principles for ADA claims asserting that the disabled are being denied medical or mental health treatment benefits. One is that, generally, the State is not obligated to provide new programs or services to the disabled which it has not previously provided to any group. For example, where New York did not provide safety-monitoring services to the physically disabled, the ADA did not compel the State to provide such services to the mentally disabled. <i>Rodriguez v. City of New York,</i> 197 F.3d 611, 618-19 (2d Cir. 1999). Also, where a State did not already provide the vocational services sought by the plaintiff, a claim of illegal discrimination under Title II was not cognizable. <i>See Doe v. Pfrommer,</i> 148 F.3d 73, 83-84 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the ADA does not itself mandate the provision of services, it does prohibit discrimination against the disabled within the services that <i>are</i> provided. For example, in <i>Olmstead,</i> the Supreme Court found there was a discrimination claim under the ADA where Georgia had denied mentally disabled patients entry into existing community-based treatment programs that were available to the non-institutionalized mentally disabled. 527 U.S. at 607, 119 S.Ct. 2176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has been clear about what the ADA does not require. The <i>Olmstead</i> Court said in response to the dissent's concerns:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not in this opinion hold that the ADA imposes on the States a \"standard of care\" for whatever medical services they render, or that the ADA requires States to \"provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">527 U.S. at 603 n. 14, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (citation omitted) (quoting <i>id.</i> at 623, 624, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (charging that \"the type of claim approved of by the majority does not concern a prohibition against certain conduct (the traditional understanding of discrimination), but rather concerns imposition of a standard of care\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Olmstead</i> also held that a State may rely on the reasonable assessment of its own professionals in determining whether a patient meets the requirements for a particular treatment program. <i>Id.</i> at 602, 119 S.Ct. 2176. That is because, in part, \"courts normally should defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health officials.\" <i>Sch. Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline,</i> 480 U.S. 273, 288, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987). We understand this to relate at least to the question of whether a plaintiff is a \"qualified\" individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the <i>Olmstead</i> Court held that the ADA does not require that a particular treatment be foisted on an unwilling participant. <i>Olmstead,</i> 527 U.S. at 602, 119 S.Ct. 2176 (citing 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.130(e)(1); <i>id.</i> pt. 35, App. A).

Choate,</i> 469 U.S. 287, 105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985), a case about the non-discrimination aspects of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicaid programs do not guarantee that each recipient will receive that level of health care precisely tailored to his or her particular needs....

These tests have been routinely applied by the courts of appeals. <i>See Schiavo v. Schiavo,</i> 403 F.3d 1289, 1300 (11th Cir. 2005); <i>Radaszewski v. Maram,</i> 383 F.3d 599, 608 (7th Cir. 2004); <i>Townsend v. Quasim,</i> 328 F.3d 511, 518 (9th Cir. 2003); <i>Cercpac v. Health &amp; Hosps. Corp.,</i> 147 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he [Rehabilitation Act and ADA] do not guarantee any particular level of medical care for disabled persons....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit, in <i>Kiman v. New Hampshire Department of Corrections,</i> 451 F.3d 274 (1st Cir. 2006), has recognized the distinction between ADA claims based on negligent medical care and those based on discriminatory medical care. <i>Id.</i> at 284; <i>see also Fitzgerald v. Corrs. Corp. of Am.,</i> 403 F.3d 1134, 1144 (10th Cir. 2005) (\"[P]urely medical decisions . . . do not ordinarily fall within the scope of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.\"); <i>Bryant v. Madigan,</i> 84 F.3d 246, 249 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"The ADA does not create a remedy for medical malpractice.\"). The State argues that plaintiff's claim must fail because it merely alleges inadequate health care, which does not constitute a Title II violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time of the summary judgment motions, plaintiff's claim came down to specifics that demonstrated that the claim was not about discriminatory denial of services, but rather about the adequacy of treatment. When asked to identify the particular services that Buchanan was denied and how that denial constituted discrimination under the ADA, plaintiff asserted that Joel Gilbert \"did nothing to enable [Buchanan] to understand his mental health problems or assist him to understand and to obtain the help he needed to continue to live with some independence and dignity in the community.\" When asked to list the reasonable accommodations that should have been provided to Buchanan, plaintiff stated that Gilbert should have (1) made weekly check-ups, (2) performed additional medical check-ups, (3) amended Buchanan's service plan to reflect his increasing needs, and (4) provided assistance and crisis intervention when he received Johnston's phone call on February 25, 2002. Plaintiff asserts Buchanan was denied an ISP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is uncontested that Maine, through Gilbert, did make regular check-ups, did attempt to meet Buchanan's increasing needs, and did provide assistance and crisis intervention. There is no viable claim that Maine did not provide mental health services to the disabled, and there is no viable claim that Maine did provide services to the disabled but discriminated among categories of the disabled in doing so. Further, under <i>Olmstead,</i> plaintiff has not shown the State's treatment professionals determined these additional services were required, <i>see</i> 527 U.S. at 603, 119 S.Ct. 2176, nor does plaintiff offer any expert testimony that they were necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the argument that the State failed to provide Buchanan an ISP, Buchanan repeatedly declined to participate in the ISP process as envisioned by the AMHI settlement agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> On October 7, 1999, in his first meeting with Gilbert, Buchanan was \"not interested in receiving services.\" On March 1, June 8, and September 13 of 2000, state employee Donald Beckwith spoke with Buchanan about creating an ISP. On each occasion, Buchanan refused. On four more occasions between December 12, 2000 and December 12, 2001, Buchanan declined offers from Gilbert to set up a treatment plan. Here, the ISP was \"opposed by the affected individual.\" <i>Id.</i> at 587, 119 S.Ct. 2176.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also no evidence that Buchanan was either discriminated against or not provided the additional services the plaintiff seeks \"by reason of\" his disability. <i>See Forestier Fradera v. Municipality of Mayagez,</i> 440 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>Parker,</i> 225 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address the question raised by this court's case law, both under &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and under the ADA, that there is a limited basis for a challenge to medical treatment decisions if and only if the challenge is framed within a larger theory of disability discrimination. <i>See Kiman,</i> 451 F.3d at 284-85; <i>Lesley v. Chie,</i> 250 F.3d 47, 55 (1st Cir. 2001). We have described two situations in which a challenge based on a treatment decision might be made: (1) the treatment decision was so unreasonable as to be arbitrary and capricious, raising an implication of pretext for some discriminatory motive, and (2) if not pretextual, the treatment decision was based on stereotypes of the disabled rather than an individualized inquiry as to the plaintiff's conditions. <i>Kiman,</i> 451 F.3d at 284-85. There was nothing unreasonable about the treatment decisions in this case and certainly no stereotyping, so neither of these arguments is available.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, judgment for Maine should be entered on the grounds that no Title II claim has been established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Title II Claims Against Lincoln County</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Lincoln County on his Title II claim. He argues that the County failed to reasonably accommodate Buchanan's disability by (1) failing to draft law enforcement policies accommodating the needs of mentally ill members of the public, and (2) failing to adequately train its officers on the needs of the mentally ill public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that the district court misunderstood his Title II claim as asserting that Title II of the ADA governs how persons are taken into custody and prohibits arrests based on misperceptions caused by disability. He disavows those theories as factually inappropriate, and he says the court's analysis \"is misplaced.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> His point, he argues, is that the law requires sufficient training of officers to prevent miscommunication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bypass the question of whether Title II of the ADA imposes duties on a county sheriff's department to draft policies and train officers on the needs of the mentally ill public. Whether obliged to do so by Title II or not, the County did in fact have such policies and such training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lincoln County Sheriff's Department drafted a policy titled \"Response to Deviant Behavior\" on November 20, 1995. That policy went into effect on December 15, 1995 and specifically addresses issues concerning mentally ill persons. The document states that \"[i]t shall be the policy of this agency to assist persons who are exhibiting symptoms of deviant behavior and appear to represent an imminent danger to themselves or to someone else.\" The stated purpose of the policy is \"[t]o describe deviant behavior and circumstances under which police personnel will make an arrest or protective detention in order to assist said person or protect the general public.\" Furthermore, Deputies Emerson and Hatch were trained on the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department Policies on both \"Response to Deviant Behavior\" and \"Use of Force.\" Emerson and Hatch also received additional training with respect to the identification of mentally ill persons and methods to employ when dealing with such persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff contends that the policies put in place by the County and the training received by Emerson and Hatch were deficient. In particular, plaintiff takes issue with the lack of procedures and training to assist officers in <i>successfully communicating</i> with mentally ill individuals. An argument that police training, which was provided, was insufficient does not present a viable claim that Buchanan was \"denied the benefits of the services . . . of a public entity\" by reason of his mental illness, as required under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Section 1983 Claim Against Case Manager Gilbert</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the equal protection \"class of one\" claim, plaintiff argues that Gilbert intentionally denied critical intensive case management to Buchanan while providing that service to other high-risk mental health clients living in a community setting. He also argues that Buchanan did not receive the services to which he was entitled under the AMHI consent decree while others did get such services. Our prior analysis largely takes care of this issue, but we go on to discuss plaintiff's claim in the equal protection framework, which is different from the ADA method of analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's broad equal protection claims are insufficient; the more specific claim is that Buchanan did not receive a team-produced ISP, while other high-risk patients did.

Michael Buchanan was born in 1940 and moved to Maine in approximately 1978. Buchanan had shown signs of mental illness since the early 1970s. He was involuntarily committed to the Augusta Mental Health Institute (AMHI) on two separate occasions. The first admission was in 1988, and the second admission lasted from September 11, 1999 to October 19, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time there was litigation in the state courts over whether Maine, \"in its ... provision of treatment and services to present and former patients of AMHI,\" was violating the state and federal constitutions as well as state and federal laws. <i>Bates v. Dep't of Behavioral &amp; Developmental Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></span>, 894 (Me. 2004). In 1990, the parties settled the class action lawsuit by an agreement and consent decree in which Maine did not admit liability, and in which the State was to provide certain health care services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Every class member, generally, upon discharge from AMHI was entitled to receive an Individualized Support Plan (ISP) assessing the class member's strengths and needs, describing the class member's goals and objectives, and listing the services the class member needed to meet his or her goals and objectives. These individualized plans were to be \"coordinated and monitored by a community support worker\" who was then responsible for locating and delivering the needed services. Buchanan was a member of this class, as he was discharged from AMHI in October 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1999, while at AMHI, Buchanan was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychosis, schizo-affective disorder, and schizophrenia with paranoia. He was discharged on October 19, 1999, having been prescribed three medications: lithium, Haldol, and Cogentin. Buchanan was assigned to Joel Gilbert, an intensive case manager with three years of experience in that position. As an intensive case manager, Gilbert was a community support worker who was responsible for helping mental health clients live independently in the community. Gilbert described his job as helping clients obtain mental health services, as well as any other services they might need, such as housing assistance, welfare benefits, medical care, and fuel assistance. In the community support program, he handled the cases of ten to twelve high-risk patients who were seriously mentally ill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next month and a half in 1999, Gilbert visited Buchanan's house about once a week to check up on him. The house was located at the end of a one-half- to three-quarter-mile driveway that was frequently impassable by a regular vehicle. On a number of Gilbert's visits, Buchanan told Gilbert that he did not want to participate in the ISP process. The plaintiff maintains that Gilbert did not properly engage Buchanan in developing an ISP. It is uncontested that on December 2, 1999, Gilbert completed an \"outreach plan\" for Buchanan, under which Gilbert would make weekly visits to Buchanan to check on his living conditions, offer rides to town for errands, take him to doctor's appointments, and encourage him to take his medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert continued to visit Buchanan over the next two years. He took Buchanan grocery shopping at least eleven times. Gilbert took Buchanan to see the doctor at least eight times, picked up and delivered prescription drugs for Buchanan, took Buchanan to get fitted for glasses, and attended a dentist's appointment with Buchanan. Gilbert obtained state funds to purchase a wood stove and a propane heating system for Buchanan's home, as well as a watch so that Buchanan would know when to go out to the main road to be picked up by Gilbert. On two occasions, Gilbert also helped Buchanan fill out food stamp applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff asserts that, beginning in early 2001, Buchanan, after previously announcing that he would no longer take his medications, began to demonstrate signs of psychological decompensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is agreed that on December 28, 2001, Gilbert went to Buchanan's home to take him to a fuel assistance appointment. Buchanan accused Gilbert of shutting off his gas and became angry with Gilbert, claiming to have five gun permits and telling Gilbert he did not trust him. Gilbert told Buchanan he could not take him to his fuel assistance appointment in such a condition. According to Gilbert's written report, Buchanan waved his arms, made profane statements, and went back into his house stating, \"Don't come back here later, I don't want any[ ]more help, and don't bring those sheriffs here anymore either.\" As a result of this interaction, Gilbert believed it would be prudent to have a co-worker accompany him on any future visits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three days later, on December 31, 2001, Gilbert and a co-worker visited Buchanan's home. Buchanan was polite and did not appear to remember his angry interaction with Gilbert. This was Gilbert's last visit to Buchanan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert attempted to visit Buchanan twice in January 2002, but both times was unable to find a co-worker to accompany him. On February 5, 2002, Gilbert called Buchanan's brother Daniel to explain that he had been having difficulty making visits because Buchanan \"ha[d] become angry with [his] support.\" Gilbert did say that he had been keeping watch over Buchanan through Terry Johnston, Buchanan's neighbor and friend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 25, 2002, Johnston called Gilbert to report that Buchanan had growled and glared at her that morning, and that around 4:30 p.m. the same day, she had learned that someone resembling Buchanan had been spotted lighting a fire in her woodpile. Gilbert told Johnston that the fire was a criminal matter and that she should call the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining facts are pertinent particularly for plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim. Because Buchanan was killed, there is no dispute with respect to most of the facts surrounding the events after the deputies arrived at his house. We have only the account of the deputies. In limited respects, as described later, plaintiff offers a somewhat different version based either on speculation or on inference from physical facts such as the autopsy results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnston took Gilbert's advice and called the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department at approximately 5:11 p.m. on February 25, 2002, asking that officers perform a welfare check on Buchanan. Deputy Kenneth Hatch was assigned to respond to Johnston's call. Johnston told Hatch that she had contacted Buchanan's counselor about her concerns, and that Gilbert had said he would check on Buchanan the following day. She also told Hatch that although she did not wish to pursue any criminal charges, she was afraid Buchanan might light her barn on fire. After speaking with Johnston, Hatch asked Deputy Robert Emerson to accompany him to Buchanan's home. Another officer informed Hatch that Buchanan had a serious mental illness. The deputies had not had any prior dealings with Buchanan. In response to Johnston's request, the two officers promptly went out to Buchanan's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 5:59 p.m., in the winter dark, the deputies arrived at Buchanan's unplowed, snow-covered access road and set off on foot to reach the house. The house was approximately thirty-six feet long and twenty-four feet wide, and had a \"daylight basement\" with a single story over the basement. The deputies walked outside the house to the area where lights were on in the upstairs of the house. Hatch knocked on the door leading into the basement several times, but there was no response. Emerson saw Buchanan walk to the window on the long side of the house. Buchanan appeared to be screaming something, but Emerson could not hear what he was saying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan then walked to a window on the short side of the house, and pushed it open. Buchanan screamed out the window that he worked for the Massachusetts Sheriff's Department; he also said, \"You are not throwing me in a Nazi Jewish oven.\" Emerson yelled, \"Michael, are you okay? We are here to check on you.\" Buchanan answered that the deputies were not there to check on him, and then he started screaming about being with the New York State Police, that he was with the federal government, and that he had the right to sell guns. Buchanan also said something about \"not having any fires.\" Emerson yelled to Hatch and asked if he saw any fires. Hatch walked around the house, looking for open fires in or around the building. He found none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson explained to Buchanan that they only wanted to talk to him, but Buchanan said \"No\" and that they were trying to get \"Evelyn\" after him. Buchanan told the deputies to get off his property, to go back to the main road, and that he was going to kill them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan walked away from the window, then reappeared and threw some liquid at Emerson. Emerson managed to avoid being hit by most of the liquid, which smelled of liquor. Emerson thought that Buchanan was \"beyond agitated\" and seemed upset with the officers for reasons wholly unrelated to the stated purpose of their visit. Buchanan then shut the window, turned off the light in the room, went to the other side of the house, and turned lights on there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 6:20 p.m., while Emerson was still trying to talk with Buchanan, Hatch radioed dispatch to advise the officer of the situation and asked him to get in touch with Buchanan's mental health counselor to see what he advised. About one minute later, Hatch was told that Gilbert's line was busy; he instructed the officer to break through the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a loud smashing sound, which Emerson thought might be a gunshot; Hatch told Emerson that he was unsure but believed the noise was that of a window breaking. At approximately 6:24 p.m., after hearing the noise of shattering glass, Hatch spoke to dispatch and requested that the on-call supervisor be contacted and advised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Hatch did not tell Emerson that he had called the supervisor for advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan walked down the stairs of his home and appeared at the basement door. Emerson could see that the knuckles on at least one of Buchanan's hands were bloody. Emerson thought that Buchanan had put his fist through glass, and that this explained the earlier smashing sound. Buchanan opened the door and began screaming at Emerson and swearing about the \"warrants.\" Emerson explained in a soft voice that the deputies were only at Buchanan's house to talk to him. Buchanan spit on Emerson, hitting the deputy on his chest. Emerson continued to speak to Buchanan in a quiet, calm voice. Buchanan then turned and walked back into the house. We take these facts as the deputies recount them because plaintiff has offered no contrary facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson followed Buchanan into the house. Buchanan, who was on the second or third step of the staircase, spit at Emerson again. In his incident report, Emerson explained that by this time he had decided that even though Buchanan had committed several criminal acts, Emerson's thoughts were not to arrest Buchanan, but that it would be best to put Buchanan in protective custody and have him evaluated, because Emerson believed Buchanan was in an unstable mental state. Emerson listed Buchanan's agitated condition, his nonsensical screaming, and his apparently self-inflicted injuries as reasons why he believed putting Buchanan into protective custody was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch came to the door and saw a \"spot of blood\" on one of Buchanan's hands. Buchanan was again yelling and screaming, with his hands on the railing of the staircase. Emerson observed that there was fresh blood on Buchanan's hands, and although there wasn't \"a lot\" of blood, there was a \"substantial\" amount of blood. Emerson attempted to grab both of Buchanan's hands to subdue him, but Buchanan pulled his hands back, spit at Emerson a third time, and started up the basement stairs. Emerson followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buchanan went into a room and then returned to the top of the basement stairs, now carrying a knife. By this time, Deputy Emerson was almost at the top of the staircase, and Deputy Hatch was on the third or fourth step. Buchanan grabbed Emerson, and Emerson in turn attempted to reach for the knife. Buchanan grabbed Emerson's back and pushed him down against the stairs. Emerson screamed \"knife\" as Buchanan stabbed Emerson in the back of the shoulder. Emerson screamed for Hatch's help. Hatch drew his gun; Buchanan looked at Hatch as he continued to stab Emerson and did not stop. Hatch fired, but Buchanan stabbed Emerson at least two more times in the back and more times in the back of the head.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Hatch then repeatedly shot Buchanan until Buchanan fell over the railing on the stairs to the floor below. Hatch had hit Buchanan a total of four times. The first shot had hit Buchanan on the left side of his skull; the second, third, and fourth shots had all entered the left side of Buchanan's neck. The wounds were fatal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Summary Judgment Standard</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

According to plaintiff, Buchanan's odd behavior and ranting did not justify entry into the house. In fact, plaintiff argues, Buchanan made it clear that he wanted the deputies to leave, and had the officers done so, Buchanan would be alive today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff also argues that Buchanan posed no threat to himself. The cut on his hand, as the autopsy photos showed, was not serious. Nor did Buchanan pose any threat to anyone else. Furthermore, Buchanan did not provoke anyone: it was the officers who came to Buchanan and made him feel threatened, particularly when they entered Buchanan's house after he made it plain they should leave. Plaintiff argues that a reasonable officer would have waited outside Buchanan's house before making such a precipitous entry. After all, plaintiff argues, Hatch had asked the dispatch officer to contact Gilbert for advice on how to proceed. Hatch should have waited to get that advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no material disputes of fact, only disagreement about the conclusions to be drawn. The district court held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the merits, and that whether or not Hatch and Emerson <i>had</i> violated Buchanan's Fourth Amendment rights, the deputies would nonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Buchanan,</i> 417 F.Supp.2d at 57-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the first step of the immunity analysis, if we were to look only at the <i>allegations</i> in plaintiff's complaint, then we would conclude that the plaintiff has asserted a constitutional right to be free from warrantless entry in the absence of extenuating circumstances. The question becomes more complicated when there has been development of facts and a summary judgment record is before the court. We addressed that situation in <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v.

The language in <i>Saucier</i> is ambiguous on this point; the case refers both to \"the facts alleged\" and to the \"parties' submissions.\" But subsequent Supreme Court cases have clarified, implicitly if not explicitly, that courts assessing the first prong at summary judgment should look beyond the complaint to the broader summary judgment record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 61-62 (citation omitted) (quoting <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have described two situations in which a challenge based on a treatment decision might be made: (1) the treatment decision was so unreasonable as to be arbitrary and capricious, raising an implication of pretext for some discriminatory motive, and (2) if not pretextual, the treatment decision was based on stereotypes of the disabled rather than an individualized inquiry as to the plaintiff's conditions. <i>Kiman,</i> 451 F.3d at 284-85.
