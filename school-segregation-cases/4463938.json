Appellant, David A. Rogers (hereinafter “Rogers”), hereby pleads that the\n\nhonorable Court of Appeals reverse the sanctions order of the district court and\n\nrender an decision denying Appellee’s motion for sanctions against Rogers, and in\n\nsupport of this appeal shows this honorable Court as follows:\n\n                           Statement on Oral Argument\n\n2.     As this case is not legally complex, and as the facts are straightforward,\n\nRogers does not request oral argument. In the event the Court finds that oral\n\nargument would be helpful, Rogers requests to participate in such argument.\n\n                               Statement of the Case\n\n3.     Appellant is David A. Rogers (hereinafter “Rogers”).\n\n4.     Laura Pressley is a contestant of the 2014 run-off election for the District 4\n\nCity Counsel seat of Austin, Travis County, Texas.

As noted in Pressley’s brief (p. 3), the record is long and confusing.1 On\n\nJanuary 30, 2015 Pressley, through Rogers, filed her Original Contest of Election,\n\nMotion to Modify Discovery Deadlines, and Requests for Disclosure and\n\nProduction of Documents for the Office of the Austin City Council, District 4.\n\n(070215 CR 3-40)\n\n7.

Therein, Pressley designated Mark Cohen,\n\nEsq., as lead counsel in the election contest in the trial court below, replacing\n\nRogers as lead counsel and demoting him to co-counsel. Shortly after Cohen’s\n\ndesignation, Pressley was deposed by Casar’s trial counsel. Cohen defended that\n\ndeposition. During that deposition, Pressley did not specifically name persons who\n\nwere disenfranchised by the closure and consolidation of election precincts.\n\n(070215 CR 603-606)\n\n8.

Rogers asserts that the trial court, Honorable Dan Mills presiding, erred\n\nin granting sanctions against Rogers. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 8 makes\n\nclear that the lead attorney is the party responsible for the pleadings. The\n\nmotion for sanctions was based on the factual allegations asserted in the 5th and\n\n6th Amended Contests.2 At the time the allegedly violative pleadings were filed,\n\nCohen was the attorney-in-charge of the case responsible for the filings, not\n\nRogers. Consequently, as a matter of law, Rogers was not responsible for those\n\nfilings for purposes of imposing sanctions.\n\n14.                                                        Rogers further asserts that the trial court, Honorable Dan Mills\n\npresiding, erred in granting sanctions against Rogers based on the allegations\n\nin the pleadings and the responses to Contestee’s motion for no evidence summary\n\njudgment because said allegations were sufficiently supported by evidence to\n\ncomply with Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 10 and Texas Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 13 and defeat Appellee’s no evidence motion for summary\n\n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r   \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n2\n In Casar’s Amended Motion for Sanctions, filed 5-22-2015, Casar complained of the 6th\nAmended Contest, which omitted some of the materials complained of in the 5th Amended\nContest.

Was the right to seek sanctions foreclosed and barred by the\n\nlanguage of the only final judgment during the court’s plenary power, or by the\n\nRule 11 agreement that all issues between the parties were resolved for purposes of\n\nimposing sanctions?\n\n22.

Issue 6. Did the trial court err by awarding sanctions against Rogers under\n\nRogers Appellant Brief                                                          p. 6\n\fChapter 10 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code?\n\n\n\n                              Summary of Argument\n\n24.     Rogers filed the original election contest. Beginning with the April 16,\n\n2015 Notice of Designation of Lead Counsel, Mark Cohen was the attorney-in-\n\ncharge, responsible for all subsequent filings in the case. TEX. R. CIV. PRO. 8.\n\nRule 8 states:\n\n       RULE 8. ATTORNEY-IN-CHARGE On the occasion of a party's\n       first appearance through counsel, the attorney whose signature first\n       appears on the initial pleadings for any party shall be the attorney-in-\n       charge, unless another attorney is specifically designated therein.\n       Thereafter, until such designation is changed by written notice to the\n       court and all other parties in accordance with Rule 21a, said\n       attorney-in-charge shall be responsible for the suit as to such party.\n       All communications from the court or other counsel with respect to a\n       suit shall be sent to the attorney-in-charge.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n24.    Casar therefore lacked standing to move for sanctions against Rogers based\n\non post April 16, 2015 pleadings because Rogers was no longer the attorney-in-\n\ncharge of Pressley’s election contest. Casar lacked standing to seek sanctions from\n\nRogers. Standing is essential to a court’s jurisdiction. The trial court therefore\n\nlacked jurisdiction to award sanctions against Rogers. The trial court could not\n\nsanction Rogers on that basis.\n\n25.    Though this jurisdictional challenge was not raised below, a court’s\n\nRogers Appellant Brief                                                            p. 7\n\fjurisdiction may be challenged for the first time on appeal.\n\n26.                                 Based on the documents presented to the trial court, there was no basis for\n\nawarding attorney’s fees against Rogers related to filing the Fifth or Sixth\n\nAmended Contest or Contestant’s Response to Contestee’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment, all filed after Cohen was designated as lead counsel.\n\n27.                                 Rogers adopts Pressleys’ Brief, excepting Pressley’s arguments on pages 57-\n\n58 regarding the third Low4 factor. Pressley’s claims, both before and after the date\n\nCohen became lead counsel were sufficiently supported by fact and law and\n\nadequate investigation was made under the existing circumstances. The multiple\n\namendments are proof that Pressley’s counsel were responsive to the obligation to\n\npromptly amend pleadings as new facts were uncovered.\n\n28.                                 Rogers requests this honorable Appeals Court reverse and render, denying\n\nCasar’s motion for sanctions against Rogers.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              Argument\n\n   Issues 4-6\n\n29.

All claims of Pressley asserted by Rogers during the course of this election\n\ncontest were sufficiently supported by fact and law, in compliance with Texas Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 13, to meet the pleading requirements, and defeat Appellee’s\n\nno-evidence summary judgment, and, therefore, preclude the imposition of\n\nsanctions against Rogers pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nChapter 10.6\n\n31.                                                        Furthermore, “The mere fact that a trial court granted summary judgment or\n\na jury rejected a plaintiff’s claim doesn’t justify sanctions under CPRC 10.01.”\n\nHeritage Gulf Coast Props. v.

This is directly contrary to the theory advanced by\n\nCasar: “In the present case, the Court granted Mr. Casar's no-evidence summary\n\njudgment motion. Thus, the Court has already held that Ms. Pressley failed to\n\npresent evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact.

This is\n\nplainly not the law.\n\n32.    Pressley’s argument regarding the third Low factor is addressed in Rogers’\n\nappellant’s brief below.\n\n\n\nIssue 1: Lack of Jurisdiction\n\n33.    Rogers asserts the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award sanctions against\n\nhim because Casar lacked standing obtain sanctions against Rogers.\n\n\n\nStanding and Jurisdiction\n\n34.    The Texas Supreme Court, in Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control\n\nBd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444-46 (1993), explained the relationship between standing\n\nand subject matter jurisdiction:\n\n\n       Subject matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to\n       decide a case. Standing is implicit in the concept of subject-matter\n       jurisdiction. . . . Under the Texas Constitution, standing is implicit in\n       the open courts provision, which contemplates access to the courts\n       only for those litigants suffering an injury. . . . Because standing is a\n       constitutional prerequisite to maintaining a suit under both federal and\n       Texas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience\n       of the federal courts on this subject for any guidance it may yield.\n       Under federal law, a lack of standing deprives a court of\n       subject matter jurisdiction because standing is an element of such\n       jurisdiction.

On January 30, 2015, Pressley filed her Original Contest of Election signed\n\nby Rogers.

On\n\nApril 16, 2015, Pressley filed Contestant’s Notice of Designation of Lead Counsel\n\nsigned by Mark Cohen. (070215 CR 477-78). Therein, Pressley designated Mark\n\nCohen, as lead counsel in the election contest in the trial court below, replacing\n\nRogers as lead counsel and demoting him to co-counsel. See City of Tyler v.

Rogers asserts the abused its discretion in awarding sanctions against him\n\nbecause Casar lacked standing to seek sanctions against Rogers. “A trial court's\n\naward of sanctions is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.

Texas Air\n\nControl Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (1993): “The general test for standing in Texas\n\nrequires that there ‘(a) shall be a real controversy between the parties, which (b)\n\nwill be actually determined by the judicial declaration sought.’”\n\nRogers Appellant Brief                                                          p. 16\n\f47.                                                        There was no real controversy between the parties that could be resolved by\n\nthe motion for sanctions, because Casar’s controversy was against the party\n\nresponsible for the Fifth and Sixth Amended Petitions, which, as a matter of TRCP\n\n8, was Cohen, not Rogers. A judicial declaration about the conduct of Rogers\n\nwould not resolve the controversy between Casar and Cohen. Casar therefore had\n\nno standing to seek sanctions against Rogers for the filing of the Fifth and Sixth\n\nAmended Contests.                                                                                                                                                                                                           The ruling by the trial court, therefore, exceeded its\n\njurisdiction and was an abuse of discretion.\n\nIssue #3: Abuse of Discretion in the Amount of Sanctions\n\n48.                                                        “To determine if the sanctions were appropriate or just, the appellate court\n\nmust ensure there is a direct nexus between the improper conduct and the sanction\n\nimposed. Generally, courts presume that pleadings and other papers are filed in\n\ngood faith. The party seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming this\n\npresumption of good faith.” Low v.

In this case, the court did not find a nexus between improper conduct by\n\nRogers and a sanction of $50,000.

The election was held on December 16, 2014 and canvassed on December\n\n     30, 2014. In support of this election contest, Dr. Pressley will respectfully show as follows:\n\n                                               I. Discovery\n\n1.         The contestant intends that discovery be conducted under level three, a custom discovery\n\nplan for election contest devised with the approval of the court.\n\n2.        Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, and the motion set forth below, the plaintiff\n\nrequests that the defendants, within fifteen days of the service of this document, disclose the\n\ninformation and material described in Rule 194.2.\n\n                                              II. Summary\n\n3.        This contest is based on deprivation of voting rights of voters in two high population polling\n\nlocations which were improperly closed, irregularity in votes counted or not counted, and a failure to\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code requirement for storing, retrieval and printing of images of\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                              p.l\n                                                                                                              3\n\fballots cast in electronic voting machines. Travis County uses electronic voting machines from Hart\n\nIntercivic to conduct elections within the county. 1 The result of these multiple irregularities is that\n\nthe result cannot be known, and the Court must order a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such\n\nan election be timely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Election Code and the\n\nSecretary of State's regulations governing elections.\n\n\n                                                 III. Parties\n\n4.          Contestant, Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas. She is a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on December\n\n16, 2014.\n\n5.          Contestee, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas. He was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Casar may be served with process at his principal place ofbusiness, 301 W.\n\n2nd Street, Austin, Texas, 78701.\n\n6.          The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar was declared the\n\nvictor.\n\n7.          A manual recount of all early voting, election day, and provisional cast vote records, and\n\n1\n  Voters in different parts of the state utilize a number of different voting systems, all of which must\nfirst be certified by the Secretary of State. Tex. Elec. Code§ 122.001, .031. ... Once a system is\nThe eSlate, a paperless DRE manufactured by Hart Intercivic, is one of a handful ofDREs the\nSecretary has certified. [6] See Voting              Texas Secretary of State,\nhttp://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/votingsystems.shtml. Voters arriving at the polls in\ncounties using the eSlate are given a unique access code. The voter enters the code into the eSlate,\nwhich then displays the ballot. Voters tum a dial to highlight their ballot choice and then press\n\"enter\" to make a selection. After a voter completes his selections, the eSlate displays a ballot\nsummary page. If the voter's choices are correctly displayed, the voter presses the \"cast ballot\"\nbutton, and the vote is recorded. See Voter Instructions, Travis County,\nhttp://vlww. co. travis. tx. us/county_clerk/election/eS late/pdfs/English_Flyer_ 0 50923. pdf. Travis\nCounty purchased the eSlate system in 2001 and has used it since 2003.\nAndrade v. NAACP ofAustin, 345 S.\\V.3d 1, 4, 5-6 (Tex. 2011) (footnotes omitted.)\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                   p.2\n                                                                                                           4\n\fmailed-in ballots was performed on January 6 2015. 2 The results of the election were unchanged and\n\nMr. Casar remained the victor for the Run Off election and was sworn into office on January 6, 2014.\n\nHe has been notified of the filing of this action by a delivery of a copy of this Petition in accordance\n\nwith TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 21.003(b).\n\n                                      IV. Jurisdiction and Venue\n\n8.        Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                                  V. Facts\n\n9.        City of Austin District 4, comprised of 18 voting precincts, is located entirely in Travis\n\nCounty.\n\nEarly Voting\n\n10.       Early Voting for the Run Off Election for District 4 of the Austin City Council was held on\n\nDecember 1 through December 12, 2014. 3 During Early Voting from December 1 through December\n\nIih, the Travis County Clerk's Office released daily Reports for voters that voted via Ballot By Mail,\n\nand Early Voting.\n\n11.       During Early Voting, many election irregularities occurred. According to Travis Count\n\nElection Division director Michael Winn, no Zero Tapes4 were printed for machines used in Early\n\n\n2\n  Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred\ndid not satisfy statutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a\nstatutory manual recount as defined by the Texas Election Code.\n3\n  In a typical election, election officials create ballots using Ballot Origination Software System\n(\"BOSS\"). The ballot definitions are fed by the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to the eSlates\nattached to it.\n4\n  A \"zero tape\" is run on the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to ensure no votes reside in the\nsystem. When voters arrive they are given a JBC-generated PIN number that they enter on the\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                  p.3\n                                                                                                           5\n\fVoting to verify that prior to the first votes being cast, no votes were pre-registered on the machines. 5\n\nThis failure is in violation of Texas Secretary of State requirements. See Texas Secretary of State\n\n\n\n(last visited 1-29-2014).\n\nElection Day\n\n12.      Election Day was December 16, 2014. Many election irregularities occurred.\n\n13.      Voters seeking to vote at high-volume locations were improperly denied the right to cast\n\ntheir vote. Disenfranchisement of District 4 voters occurred as a result of the closing of the two\n\nhighest volume District 4 voting locations on the Run Off Election Day, December 16, 2014. The\n\nHighland Mall voting location at 6601 Airport Blvd was open during the General Election on\n\nNovember 4, 2014 and saw some of the highest volume of voters in District 4. This location was\n\nclosed for the December Run Off election and was moved to the far less convenient Travis County\n\nTax Office (5501 Airport Blvd). The Pressley campaign received multiple reports of voters being\n\nupset and confused because the voting location had been moved. The second highest voting\n\nprecinct and polling location in District 4 for the November General Election, was Precinct 222 at\n\nCooke Elementary (1511 Cripple Creek). That Precinct is comprised of more than 25% senior\n\nvoters who are 60 years and older. It was closed on Election Day for the December Run Off. It\n\nwas combined with the fourth lowest voter turnout location in District 4, Precinct 268, Grant AME\n\nWorship Center at 1701 Kramer Lane. The Pressley campaign received reports that voters\n\n\neSlate. They then vote and the votes are stored on the eSlate, Mobile Ballot Boxes (MBB), and JBC.\n5\n  Travis County received a waiver of the state requirement for such tapes for the general election\nonly in a letter dated September 30, 2014, based on the burden of the extremely long statewide\nballot. See attached September 30, 2014 letter from Texas Secretary of State.\nThe run-off election ballot includes only City Council and Mayoral candidates. The run-off was\nrestricted to two candidates in the races requiring a run-off, unlike the first round, in which as many\nas twelve candidates participated in some races.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                  p.4\n                                                                                                             6\n\fshowed up to Cooke Elementary for the December Run Off on Election Day and were upset and\n\nconfused and did not subsequently show up to vote at the Kramer location. This is voter\n\ndisenfranchisement of the two most critical, highest volume voting locations in District 4. For\n\nexample, there are 2,971 registered voters in Precinct 222 and only 545 voted in the December\n\n            6\nelection.       This action by the Travis County Clerk had a disproportionate effect on minorities,\n\nworking people, and elderly voters of District 4, which is one of the Hispanic-opportunity districts\n\nin the City of Austin. As a result, some voters registered at those locations were improperly\n\ndenied the right to cast their vote.\n\n14.         No zero tapes were printed at the countywide locations when the polls opened. The\n\nSecretary of State (\"SOS\") has procedures requiring these activities. See Texas Secretary of State\n\nAdvisory 2012-03, 6(g)(vi), httg:/                                                                 (last\n\nvisited 1-29-2014).\n\n15.         On Election Day, no results tapes were printed at the countywide locations when closing\n\nthe polls. The SOS procedures require the printing of closing results tapes, also. Texas Secretary\n\nof State Advisory 2012-03, 6(k)(iii)\n\n(last visited 1-29-2014).\n\n16.         On Election Day, Pressley campaign official poll watchers were denied access to signing\n\nresults tapes at two polling locations, Gus Garcia and Randall's at Research Blvd. This violates\n\nSecreatry of State regulations requiring that poll watchers be allowed to sign such tapes. \"The\n\npresiding election judge, an election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or more\n\nwatchers are present, shall sign the results tape(s).\" Texas Secretary of State Advisory 2012-03,\n\n6(k)(i)                                                                    (last visited 1-29-20 14).\n\n\n6\n    Polling location charts for November and December are attached.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                 p.5\n                                                                                                           7\n\f17.      On Election Day, Pressley campaign official poll watchers not allowed access at Dobie\n\nMiddle School, where the most important ballots (for the Graham, Gus Garcia, and Virginia\n\nBrown precincts) were placed in transit to central counting. Those boxes were the largest and\n\nstrongest Pressley boxes.\n\n18.      On Election Day, poll watchers were improperly denied access to Central Counting\n\nactivities with Mobile Ballot Boxes (\"MBB\"), Tally activities, and the like. 7\n\nThe Canvass\n\n19.      On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, the Mayor of Austin and the Austin City Council\n\n\n7\n  Hart's eSlate System\nHart's electronic (DRE) voting system is known as eSlate. The eSlate system is comprised of several\ndistinct components.\nThe Ballot Origination Software System (\"BOSS\") is used by election officials to define and create\nindividualized electronic ballots. Data is entered once into BOSS and then flows through all\ncomponents of the eSlate system.\nThe Mobile Ballot Box (\"MBB\") is a reusable, portable flash memory card. It is used to store and\ntransfer election information. When inserted into the Judge's Booth Controller, the MBB supplies\nelection information and ballot styles, it stores an electronic representation of how votes were cast.\nOnce voting has concluded the MBB is removed and its contents are tallied by the Tally software.\nThe Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") is the \"brain\" that manages the system, enabling poll workers\nto know which voting booths are in use at any time. The JBC issues access codes for the voters' use.\nIt can control up to 12 daisy-chained eSlate units.\neSlate refers to the system generally and to the device that voters use to cast ballots, unless using\npaper ballots, in which case Ballot Now is used. The eSlate may be equipped with a disabled access\nunit (\"DAU\") for use by disabled voters. The eSlate units are physically connected to the JBC,\nwhich stores cast-vote records.\nTally is a software application that reads, stores, and tabulates the cast-vote records from the MBB\n(the portable flash card that transferred the cast-vote records from the JBC). Tally tabulates all early\nvoting, absentee, and election day results, and produces various reports.\nRally is a software application that is capable of reading, storing, and transferring cast-vote data\nfrom polling places or collection centers with respect to early returns.\nThe System for Election Records and Verification Operations (\"SERVO\") software is an election\nrecords archiving and asset management system. SERVO is designed to recover data from\nequipment in the case of a lost or damaged MBB. SERVO also is designed for various recount\npurposes.\nBallot Now is a digital-scan paper ballot system that manages the printing, scanning, and resolution\nof mailed-in paper ballots. It also records the electronic cast vote records to an MBB to be read and\ntabulated with Tally.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                             p.6\n                                                                                                           8\n\fconducted an initial official canvass and certification for the Election Day results for all races\n\non the ballot, including City of Austin District 4. The canvassed and certified totals for District\n\n4 were Laura Pressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n20.      Comparison of the canvassed results with the Early Voting voter reports showed\n\ninconsistencies in the results. Travis County reported that 2,651 total voters voted in Early Voting in\n\nDistrict 4. Reviewing the voter ID's, 437 entries existed for those submitting Ballot by Mail (BBM).\n\nThere were at least 28 duplicate entries for BBM. At least 28 mail-in votes appear to have been\n\ncounted twice. See Appendix A.\n\n21.      Once duplicate BBM's were removed, 2,622 voter names remained that voted in Early Voting\n\naccording to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that were distributed prior to Election Day,\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for\n\nGreg Casar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number ofballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. Therefore, there are 79 more ballots than voters for Early Voting. These 79 extra ballots are\n\ndistributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4 Race. (One precinct, with one eligible voter,\n\nshowed no votes.) See Appendix B.\n\n22.      An initial review the 2,622 Early Voting voter names and addresses with returned mail,\n\nabout 14 of the voters had moved or no longer resided in District 4 and were not eligible to vote in\n\nthe District 4 Run Off Election. Therefore, at least 14 ineligible voters cast votes in this contest.\n\nStatistical Improbabilities\n\n23.      A analysis of the voting results show a pattern of mathematical anomalies which is highly\n\nunlikely to occur naturally. For the nine (9) precincts in District 4 with more than 200 voters, the\n\nhighest volume of voters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant received compared to Contestee is\n\nthe same ratio in theN ovember General Election (with a total of 8 candidates) as it was in the\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                p.7\n                                                                                                           9\n\fDecember Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 35.1% vs 35.0% respectively. In addition, the\n\naverage of the percentages of the unweighted precincts that the Contestant received compared to\n\nContestee, in the November General Election and the December Run Off, are also equal at equal\n\n35.1% and 35.1 %, respectively. No other race in the City is within a lOx such a close non-\n\nvariation, and only two races are within 1OOx such a variation. See Appendix C.\n\n24.      Such a result strongly suggests hardware problems, software problems, procedural issues\n\nor mishandling of machines which may have caused errors in tabulation or reporting.\n\n25.      A similar issue was observed for Early Voting (which typically experiences 1;2 the total\n\nvoting for an election). For the precincts with more than 100 voters, the highest volume of early\n\nvoters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant received compared to Contestee is the same ratio in\n\nthe Early Voting in the November General Election (with a total of8 candidates) as it was in the\n\nEarly Voting in the December Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 36.7% vs 36.7% respectively.\n\nAgain, no other race in the City is within a 1Ox such a close non-variation, and only two races are\n\nwithin lOOx such a variation. See Appendix D.\n\n26.      Such a result strongly suggests hardware problems, software problems, procedural issues\n\nor mishandling of machines which may have caused errors in tabulation or reporting.\n\n27.      Contestant is concerned there may have been some hardware issues, software\n\nmalfunctions or mishandling that may have caused errors in the tabulation of the results.\n\nAdditionally, some number of ineligible voters appear to have cast votes.\n\nThe Recount\n\n28.      Given the highly improbable statistical anomalies, the duplicate Ballot by Mail entries,\n\nand that there are more ballots than number of voters for Early Voting (overvotes), Contestant\n\nrequested a manual recount of the District 4 Election with the goal of reconciling the\n\n\nPressley v.

On January 4, 2015, the Mayor of Austin and City Clerk approved Contestant's\n\namended petition requesting a manual recount of actual stored balloting System. Contestant's\n\namended petition included a request to reconcile the ballots cast with the number of voters documented\n\non the sign in sheets and combination forms for District 4 for the countywide polling locations and\n\nPrecincts to ensure accurate reporting of results. The number of voters recorded and the number of votes\n\nrecorded did not match.\n\n30.      On January 5, 2015, prior to the Recount, Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 213.016,\n\n\"PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING ELECTRONIC\n\nVOTING MACHINES,\" Dr. Pressley communicated over the phone with the Director of Travis\n\nCounty Elections Division. Pressley informed the Director that she desired to be present during\n\nthe printing of images of ballots cast. \"Each candidate is entitled to be present and to have\n\nrepresentatives present in the same number as prescribed by Section 213.013(b) for a recount\n\nduring the printing of the images.\" An email was sent to The Travis County Clerk and copied to\n\nthe Texas Secretary of State's Office, to the same effect.\n\n31.      On January 6, 2015, a manual recount was conducted and additional irregularities ensued\n\nwith regard to and during the recount.\n\nNo Ballot images\n\n32.      On Tuesday, January 6, 2015, at 11 :OOam when the recount was to begin, the Travis\n\nCounty Clerk and the Recount Committee relayed to Contestant and her official recount watcher,\n\nKaren Renick, the images of ballots cast were not available, would not be printed, and would not\n\n\n\n\nPressley v.

See id. § 213.016.\"\n\nAndrade v. NAACP ofAustin, 287 S.W.3d 240, 258 (Tex. App. Austin 2009), rev'd on other\n\ngrounds by Andrade v. NAACP o.fAustin, 345 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2011). Failure to print images of\n\nballots violates this provision of the election code.\n\nPrinting errors\n\n33.        Prior to the start of the Recount, Travis County selected the data files to print and pre-\n\nprint an aggregated data file of Cast Vote Records (CVR's). The pre-printed CVR's contained a\n\nsubset of the data that a District 4 ballot contains. Upon starting the recount on January 6, 2014\n\naround 11 :OOam, Contestant relayed to the Travis County Clerk and the Recount Committee, that\n\nthe lack of providing printed images ofballots cast were a violation of TEX. ELEC. CODE§\n\n213.016.\n\n34.        Cast Vote Records are not \"images ofballots cast.\" Ballots are defined in Texas Election\n\nCode Chapter 52, Subchapter C. 9 Section 52.075 of the Subchapter also allows the Secretary of\n\n\n\n8\n  See attached Affidavit of Karen Renick\n9\n  For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that subchapter are Sec. 52.003 and Sec.\n52.070.\nSec. 52.003.

Casar OP Contest                                                               p.JO\n                                                                                                         12\n\fState to \"prescribe the form and content of a ballot\" for electronic voting machines.\n\n35.      At the same meeting, Dr. Pressley stated that the pre-printing of recount records and\n\nstarting the recount process was also a violation of213.016 and 213.009(c), respectively. A\n\nmember of the recount committee responded to one of the recount watchers: \"They started all this\n\non Sunday [January 4, 2015].\"\n\n36.      Pressley warned the County Clerk that the irregularities, of not printing the images of\n\nballots cast, were in violation of the approved amended Petition for Recount and the CODE and\n\nwas grounds for an Incident Report. Printing the CVR data files were in essence, reprinting the\n\nprevious results obtained on Election night. A CVR is essentially nothing more than a tally sheet-\n\nit does not \"count\" the images of ballots- it merely reprints the tally. It was not recounting the\n\nsource data of the images of the ballots cast, and as such it is not a meaningful check on the\n\noriginal count. 10 Using the CVR instead of ballot image also appears to violate Texas Election\n\n\nname.\"\n\n(e) A square shall be printed to the left of each line provided for write-in voting under Section\n52.066(c), but failure to place a mark in the square does not affect the counting of a write-in vote.\n(emphasis added.)\n10\n   Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (Dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.) In its 2014 Electronic Voting System\nProcedures bulletin, posted online at\n                            the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot\nimages. See, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8 - Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEC § 214.071):\n1. The candidate requesting a recount may request that the recount be done electronically or\n        manually.\n2.For an electronic recount, the persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n        also authorized to be present as the election media are reloaded into the central accumulator\n        system.\n3.For a manual recount of a DRE election, the Recount Coordinator shall organize the printing of\n        cast vote records (ballot images) for the affected race or issue.\n\n\nPressley v.

Contestant requested to conditionally proceed with the Recount and re-print the available\n\nCVR data files.\n\n38.      Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 213.007, the machines, materials, programs, and\n\nrecords may be available to the Recount Committee. Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§\n\n213.013(h), each person entitled to be present at a recount is entitled to observe recount activities.\n\nContestant was not allowed to view the full recount process and how the recount data was selected\n\nfrom the electronic voting machines. The CVR data files were identified, isolated and pre-selected\n\nprior to the beginning of the Recount. Contestant requested to view the source and properties of\n\nthe CRV files, such as dates of the CRV files and origination, and was denied by the Recount\n\nCommittee Member, the Travis County Director of Elections.\n\nPrecinct Returns\n\n39.      Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 214.002, counting procedures for a recount shall be\n\ncertified in the same manner as the original count. Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§\n\n\n\n4. The Recount Coordinator shall notify the parties in the recount of the date, place, and time the\n                printing of cast vote records (ballot images) will take place.\n5. The full recount committee is not required to be present at the printing of cast vote records (ballot\n                images) and the Recount Chair shall determine how many members should be\n                present. The persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n                entitled to be present as the cast vote records (ballot images) are printed and to have\n                the same number of representatives as allowed for the recount.\n6.If the manual recount does not take place immediately after the printing of the cast vote records\n                (ballot images), the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be locked and\n                secured until the recount takes place.\n7 .A manual count of the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be conducted in the same\n                manner as a recount of hand-counted paper ballots.\nAfter the recount is complete, the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be secured and\npreserved for the appropriate preservation period for maintaining election records.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                             p.l2\n                                                                                                           14\n\f65.014(b )(1), the procedures for preparing the original precinct returns must state the total number\n\nof voters who voted at the polling location as indicated by the poll list. Poll lists were not\n\napparently reviewed by the Recount Committee during the recount. Dr. Pressley requested the\n\npoll lists to be reviewed and the number voters per precinct be reconciled with those documented\n\non the polling location combination sign-in forms. Pressley requested those numbers be\n\nreconciled with the recount results, because of Early Voting voter lists discrepancies identified in\n\nthe Recount Petition. The request was denied by the Travis County Clerk, the Chair of the\n\nRecount Committee, and the Director of Travis County Elections. The request was also\n\nspecifically made prior to the recount in the Amended Petition for Recount.\n\n40.      Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 213.012, the committee chair prepared a report of the\n\nvote count. The chair wrote \"The numbers of voters matched the number of ballots cast,\" and\n\nsigned the report. During the Recount, the numbers of voters on voter lists were not reconciled\n\nwith the ballots recounted by the chair.\n\n41.      On January 6, 2015, the recount was conducted and completed. After the recount, the\n\ntotals were unchanged as compared to the original canvassed results. The totals were Laura\n\nPressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n42.      Reconciliation of voter signatures on rolls at polling locations and total ballots cast has\n\nnot been completed. An election contest is the only available remedy to explore the discrepancy\n\nbetween the the number of ballots counted and the number voter names and signatures in the\n\nprecincts.\n\n43.      Various records will need to be obtained from Travis County election officials to ensure\n\nthat all the information is obtained and available to be analyzed to ensure that all votes that should\n\nhave been counted were counted and, in the alternative, that all illegal votes which should not have\n\n\nPressley v.

The sum total of those voting irregularities exceeds the number of votes by which the\n\nelection was decided.\n\n45.      Because no images ofballots cast can be retrieved, printed and count, Travis County\n\ncannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and the election is void. As a matter\n\nof law, the Court must therefore order a new election. TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 232.041.\n\n                                       VI. Petition Timely Filed\n\n46.      This Election Contest is brought in accordance with the provisions of TEX. ELEC. CODE\n\n§ 232.008, which requires the Original Petition to be filed with the District Court not later than the\n\n30th day after the date the official result of the contested election is determined.\n\n47.      On Tuesday, December 30th, the Mayor and City Council of Austin conducted an official\n\ncanvass and certification of the Run Off results for all races on the December 16, 2014 ballot,\n\nincluding District 4. However a recount was conducted on January 6, 2015 and those results did\n\nnot change. The deadline for submission of a petition in an election contest is January 29, 2015.\n\nTherefore, this petition is timely filed.\n\n                                    VII.

Contestants further requests that the Court sign an order requiring that Contestee's\n\nresponse to the request for disclosure, and all other responses and answers in this case be hand-\n\ndelivered, faxed or emailed.\n\n52.      The foregoing modifications to standard discovery procedures are necessary because of\n\nthe accelerated procedures that apply to this primary election contest. For example, the trial\n\nwould be over before the disclosures and documents were due if the standard discovery deadlines\n\nremain applicable. The foregoing reasons constitute good cause for the requested relief.\n\n                                   REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION\n\n53.

The contestant intends that discovery be conducted under level three, a custom discovery\n\nplan for election contest devised with the approval of the court.\n\n                                  II. REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE\n\n2.        Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, and the motion set forth below, the plaintiff\n\nrequests that the defendants, within thirty days of the service of the Original Petition, disclose the\n\ninformation and material described in Rule 194.2.\n\n                                             III. SUMMARY\n\n3.         This contest is based on the facts that illegal votes were counted, election officers prevented\n\neligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal votes, and election officers made\n\nmistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true outcome. Thus, deprivation of\n\nvoting rights of voters in several high population polling locations which were improperly closed,\n\nirregularity in votes counted or not counted, and a failure to comply with the Texas Election Code\n\nrequirement for storing, retrieval and printing of \"images of ballots cast\" in electronic voting\n\nmachines occurred and negatively affected the outcome for Pressley. Particularly, the improper\n\nclosure, consolidation and moving of the voting locations alone appears to have reduced the vote\n\nconsiderably more than the margin reported in the canvass of the election. 2\n\n4.        Additionally, Travis County uses electronic voting machines from Hart Intercivic to conduct\n\n\n\n2This is sufficient to \"materially affect[] the election results.\" Gonzalez v.

ELEC. CODE\n\n§213.016). Without these statutorily-required \"images of ballots cast\" it is impossible for the Court\n\nto determine the actual election outcome, as the only actual ballots - the mail-in ballots - are exactly\n\nand perfectly tied between the two candidates. The Travis County Clerk has asserted that the system\n\nTravis County uses cannot print \"images of ballots cast.\" Images of ballots cast\" is not the same as\n\n\"cast vote records.\" The Court, consequently, must reject any \"cast vote records\" produced and\n\ntallied by such machines. The result of these multiple irregularities is that the result cannot be\n\nknown, and the Court must order a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such an election be\n\ntimely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Election Code and the Secretary of State's\n\nregulations governing elections.\n\n5.     \"The purpose of the election code is to ensure that the true will of the voters is 'fairly expressed'\n\nand that the evidence of that expression is 'properly preserved.'

While some actual ballots were preserved - the mail-in ballots, in which the candidates are\n\nperfectly tied - the vast majority of ballots and the evidence of the voters' intent were not preserved.\n\nAccording to the Travis County Clerk, there are no \"images of ballots cast\" that the court can\n\nreview.

Contestant Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis County,\n\nTexas. She was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on December 16,\n\n2014.\n\n8.        Contestee Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas.      He was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on\n\nDecember 16,2014. Casar has been served and has answered in this cause.\n\n9.        The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar was declared the\n\nvictor.\n\n10.       A \"manual recount\" of all early voting, election day, provisional, and mailed-in ballots was\n\nattempted on January 6, 2015. 6 The mail-in ballots were exactly tied between the candidates, at 240\n\n\n\n5 The requirement to preserve \"images of ballots cast\" in the statute is fundamental to preserving the\nevidence of the will of the voters. By failing to preserve that evidence, the County has destroyed\nevidence of the expression of the will of the voters and forced the court to call a new election.\n6 Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.4\n                                                                                                           342\n\feach, for a total of 480 votes. 7 The attempted recount was a nullity and a real recount was made\n\nimpossible in that the attempted recount violated state law and was incorrectly performed using of the\n\n\"cast vote records\" in lieu of \"images of ballots cast\" combined with the actual mail in ballots. Based\n\non the counting of \"cast vote records\" and mail in ballots, as could be predicted, the invalid recount did\n\nnot change the reported results of the election and the original declaration of Mr. Casar as the victor for\n\nthe run off election did not change. Casar was sworn into office on January 6, 2014.         He has been\n\nnotified of the filing of this action by a delivery of a copy of this Petition in accordance with TEX.\n\nELEC. CODE § 21.003(b).\n\n                                 V. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n11.     Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                               VI. FACTS\n\n            Travis County Election Officials Prevented Eligible Voters from Voting\n\n12.     City of Austin District 4, comprised of 18 voting precincts, is located entirely in Travis\n\nCounty. Early Voting and Election Day was December 1-12, and 16, 2014, respectively.               Voters\n\nseeking to vote at high-volume locations were improperly denied the right to cast their vote.\n\nDisenfranchisement of District 4 voters occurred as a result of the closing of the highest volume\n\nDistrict 4 voting locations in the Run Off during Early Voting and Election Day, December 16,\n\n\ndid not satisfy statutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a\nstatutory manual recount as defined by the Texas Election Code.\n7 These were the only actual ballots counted during the \"manual recount.\" The mail-in ballots were\nmore than 10% of the total ballots cast in the election. The allegation of the county is that, despite\nthe perfect tie in mail-in ballots, Casar beat Pressley by a 2-to-1 margin in the remaining ballots.\nThis is a variation in election results that is highly improbable and unrecorded to Contestant's\nknowledge.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                   p.5\n                                                                                                              343\n\f2014.\n\n13.     The Highland Mall voting location at 6601 Airport Blvd was open during the General\n\nElection for Early Voting and Election Day on October 20-31, and November 4, 2014,\n\nrespectively and saw some of the highest volume of voters in District 4. This location was the\n\ndesignated voting location for Precinct 142 and was an important and convenient voting location\n\nfor Precinct 156 and others nearby. It was closed for the December Run Off election for Early\n\nVoting and Election Day. It was moved to the far less convenient Travis County Tax Office at\n\n5501 Airport Blvd (See Appendix 1). The Pressley campaign received multiple reports of voters\n\nbeing upset and confused because the voting location had been moved.\n\n14.     Specifically, reports were received by Contestant on Election Day, December 16th , from\n\nvoters while Contestant was phone banking. District 4 voter, Thomas Crawford showed up at\n\nCooke Elementary to vote, and reported no signs were posted to indicate where the polling\n\nlocation had been moved. Similar reports were received by Brad Parsons, a campaign volunteer,\n\nwho was phone banking on Election Day. Campaign supporter, Matthew Palmer reported that\n\nHighland Mall was closed and it was a problem for voters.        Based on information and belief,\n\nContestant asserts that said confusion was a result of failure to post, or premature removal of, a\n\nnotice at Cooke Elementary, Precinct 222, of the relocation of the polling place.\n\n15.     Upon reviewing voter rolls for Pct 156 and 142, published by Travis County, Appendix 2\n\nshows names, addresses and precincts of 365 voters of Pcts 156 and 142 that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 365 voters were identified based on their voting histories which include\n\nbut are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary\n\nElections. The extensive voting histories of these 365 voters show they are the most consistent\n\nvoters in Precincts 142 and 156 and surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                           p.6\n                                                                                                     344\n\fin 2014.   In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters, multiple times, as very\n\nstrong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs posted), who were waiting\n\nto vote on Election Day. These voters total 73. Therefore, Contestant alleges a total of 438 voters\n\nin Precincts 142 and 156 were disenfranchised.\n\n16.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (detailed voter information of\n\nprecincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting in the General and\n\nRun off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County. Upon receipt and\n\nreview of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify additional voters and\n\nimprove the accuracy of this list.    Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of collecting\n\naffidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n17.    The second highest voting precinct and polling location in District 4 for the November\n\nGeneral Election was Precinct 222 at Cooke Elementary located at 1511 Cripple Creek. That\n\nPrecinct is comprised of more than 25% senior voters who are 60 years and older. It was closed\n\nduring Election Day for the December Run Off (See Appendix 1). It was combined with the\n\nfourth lowest voter turnout location in District 4, Precinct 268, Grant AME Worship Center at\n\n1701 Kramer Lane.\n\n18.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Rob Hale, a resident and voter in Pct 222.\n\nAs usual, he and other Pct 222 voters showed up to Cooke Elementary for the December Run Off\n\non Election Day and were confused as to why Cooke Elementary was closed for voting for Pct\n\n222. He helped senior voters look up an alternative location in which to vote on Kramer Lane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Kramer location, he waited for the senior voters and they did not arrive. In\n\naddition, he had a relative that showed up at Cooke Elementary to vote, and the relative reported\n\nno signs were posted to indicate where the polling location had been moved.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.7\n                                                                                                       345\n\f19.    Upon reviewing Pct 222 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 3 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 248 voters that we allege were disenfranchised. These 248 voters have\n\nvoting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin\n\nCouncil Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 248 voters show\n\nthey are the most consistent voters in Precinct 222 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City\n\nCouncil Run off election in 2014.     In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters,\n\nmultiple times, as very strong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs\n\nposted), which were waiting to vote on Election Day. These voters total 71. Therefore, Contestant\n\nalleges a total of319 voters in Precinct 222 alone were disenfranchised.\n\n20.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (such as detailed voter\n\ninformation such as precincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting\n\nin the General and Run off elections), has been requested through Discovery from Travis County.\n\nUpon receipt and review of Discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify\n\nadditional voters and improve the accuracy of this list. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process\n\nof collecting affidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n21.    Another voting location open during the General Election but closed for the District 4 Run\n\noff was Precinct 133, which was open for the General Election at Blanton Elementary located at\n\n5408 Westminster. It was combined with the non-District 4 Precinct 130, at Memorial UMC.\n\n22.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Pct 133, Election Judge, Arthur Turner, a\n\nresident and voter in Pct 133. During Election Day, voters from Pct 133, showed up at Blanton\n\nElementary to vote in the Run Off and were confused and upset as to why Blanton Elementary was\n\nclosed for voting for Pct 133. Mr. Turner had multiple calls from upset voters who did not know\n\nwhere to vote.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.8\n                                                                                                         346\n\f23.    Upon reviewing Pct 133 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 4 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 116 voters Contestant alleges were disenfranchised. These 116 voters\n\nhave voting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of\n\nAustin Council Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 116\n\nvoters show they are the most consistent voters in Precinct 133 and they surprisingly did not vote\n\nin the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n24.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (such as detailed voter\n\ninformation such as precincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting\n\nin the General and Run off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County.\n\nUpon receipt and review of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify\n\nadditional voters and improve the accuracy of this list. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process\n\nof collecting affidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n25.    Three additional polling locations were closed for the Run off election for District 4 (Pcts\n\n209, 258, and 260).     Upon reviewing the voter rolls for these precincts published by Travis\n\nCounty, Appendix 5 shows names, addresses and precincts of 235 voters that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 235 voters have voting histories which include but are not limited to\n\nvoting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary Elections.             The\n\nextensive voting histories of these 235 voters show they are the most consistent voters in Precincts\n\n209,258, and 260 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n26.    The total number of closed/moved/combined precincts in District 4 for the Run off comes\n\nto a total of 7 Precincts out of 17 voting precincts in District 4. Therefore, 41 % of District 4's\n\npolling locations were closed, combined or moved for the December Austin City Council Run off.\n\nAppendix 6. This caused a much lower than expected turnout for Election Day for District 4.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.9\n                                                                                                         347\n\f27.    To summarize, typically Election Day and Early Voting tum out is very similar. Early\n\nVoting for the District 4 Run Off race saw approximately 2,646 voters and on Election Day only\n\n1,771 turned out. Due closing/ moving/ combining of 41 % of District 4 Polling locations, voters\n\nwere confused and disenfranchised and Election Day voters were about 875 short.\n\n28.    The County's actions of closing multiple, key, high volume polling locations had a\n\ndisproportionate effect on minorities, working people, and elderly voters of District 4-one of the\n\nHispanic-opportunity districts in the City of Austin.        Four of Pressley's strongest voting\n\nlocations/boxes that showed over 50% for Pressley (222, 156, 133, 258), as evidenced by the only\n\nremaining ballots, Mail in Ballot results, were moved or closed for the Run Off election (See\n\nAppendix 6).\n\n\n\n29.    As a result of these aggressive and improper closures, voters registered at those locations\n\nwere improperly denied the right to cast their vote. The closure of these pro-Pressley precincts was\n\nunfair and undermined the true outcome of the election. A conservative count of disenfranchised\n\nvoters resulting from the improper closure/moving/combining of precincts 133, 142, 156, 209,\n\n222, 258, and 260 is 1,108. This value is consistent with the ]ow voter turnout on Election\n\nDay as compared to Early Voting. Upon evaluation of discovery responses from Travis County,\n\na more accurate number may be provided. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of obtaining\n\ntestimony regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n\n\nTravis County Ejection Officials Allowed Ineligible Voters to Cast Votes (Illegal Votes)\n\n30.

A\n\nmore detailed review of the voter registrar information provided by Travis County is needed with\n\nregard to Provisional Ballots, statements of residence, etc. Upon evaluation of Discovery\n\nresponses from Travis County, a more accurate number may be provided. A list of the 64 voter's\n\nVoter ID's and precincts are found in Appendix 7.\n\n31.    \\Vith regard to additional categories for illegal votes, it is unlikely that voters that are not\n\ninterested in voting in a General Election will be interested in voting in a Run Off election. After\n\nreviewing Travis County voter rolls (https:lltax-office.traviscountytx.gov/voter-data), for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off, 156 voters voted in the Run Off that did not vote in the General\n\nElection. Many are Ballot by Mails and a large number voted at specific locations. These are\n\npotentially illegal votes and we ask the court to allow Contestant time to review and evaluate\n\nvarious Discovery responses from Travis County voting records including, but not limited to,\n\nBallot by Mail, voter registration cards, polling location sign in sheets, and residency records, etc.\n\nto validate the votes were cast legally. A List of these voters are found in Appendix 8.\n\n                 More Ballots Than Voters During Early Voting (IHega} Votes)\n\n32.    On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, the Mayor of Austin and the Austin City Council\n\nconducted an initial official canvass and certification for the Election Day results for all races\n\non the ballot, including City of Austin District 4. The canvassed and certified totals for District\n\n4 were Laura Pressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n33.    The canvassed results were inconsistent with the Early Voting voter reports. Travis County\n\nreported that 2,651 total voters voted in Early Voting in District 4. Reviewing the voter ID's, 437\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.ll\n                                                                                                          349\n\fentries existed for those submitting Ballot by Mail (BBM). There were at least 28 duplicate entries for\n\nBBM. At least 28 mail-in votes appear to have been counted twice or three times. See Appendix 6,\n\nDuplicate Ballot by Mail Entries.\n\n34.     Once duplicate BBM's were removed, 2,622 voter names remained that voted in Early Voting\n\naccording to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that were distributed prior to Election Day,\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for\n\nGreg Casar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number of ballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. Therefore, there are 80 more ballots than voters for Early Voting. These 80 extra ballots are\n\ndistributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4 Race. 8 (One precinct, with one eligible voter,\n\nshowed no votes.) See Appendix 7, Early Voting Discrepancies.\n\n                                      Statistical Improbabilities\n\n35.    An analysis of the voting results show a pattern of mathematical anomalies which is highly\n\nunlikely to occur naturally. (See Appendix 8, pages 1-3.) For the nine (9) precincts in District 4\n\nwith more than 200 voters,9 the highest volume of voters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant\n\nreceived compared to Contestee is the same ratio in the November General Election (with a total\n\nof 8 candidates) as it was in the December Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 35.1 % vs 35.0%\n\nrespectively.   In addition, the average of the percentages of the unweighted precincts that the\n\nContestant received compared to Contestee, in the November General Election and the December\n\nRun Off, are also equal at 35.1 % and 35.1 %, respectively.

See\n\nattached Appendix 8, Comparison of Election Returns.\n\n36.     The fact that so many precincts showed exactly the same and unchanged results for the General\n\nElection and the Run Off is indicative of mistakes made by Travis County election officers. These\n\nmistakes are likely related to and are due to, but not limited to, the handling of voter hardware,\n\nsoftware, etc.\n\n37.         From Travis County Voter Rolls, though over 4,000 voters were different between the\n\nGeneral and Run Off elections, the unique and unlikely occurrence that the results remain unchanged\n\nand which has not occurred in the last 11 years in Travis County for any other Run Off candidate or\n\nelection is highly improbable. The occurrence is surprising, is strictly isolated to District 4, and is\n\nindicative of human error. Because so many high volume District 4 precincts showed exactly the same\n\npercentage results for Pressley and Casar, it is possible that some memory cards or counting software\n\nused in the General Election were mistakenly reused in error for the Run Off.\n\n38.         Contestee Casar alleges the factual and statistically improbable election results for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off \"are unsurprising.\" This is indicative of emotional wishful thinking\n\nrather than a clear-eyed analytical assessment of evidence and data. Additionally, Casar offers vague\n\nand irrelevant references and personal attacks from a politically biased news source, the far-left Austin\n\nChronicle. The Chronicle endorsed and directly campaigned for Contestee Casar. Additionally, the\n\nChronicle has little to no scientific expertise on statf that is qualified to offer expert testimony on\n\ncomplex topics of mathematics, chemistry, physics and engineering, which they attempt to report and\n\ncritique.\n\n39.

Several election safeguards and procedures defined by the Legislature and the Secretary of\n\nState that are intended to prevent human errors were mistakenly not followed by Travis County. The\n\nmistakes and failure to adhere to the Secretary of State's procedures led to and caused illegal votes to be\n\ncounted.\n\n41.        With regard to the counting of illegal votes, during Early and Election Day Voting, many\n\nelection irregularities occurred and mistakes were made by Travis County election officers.\n\nAccording to Travis County Election Division director Michael \\Vinn, no Zero Tapes 10 were printed\n\nfor machines to verify that directly prior to the first votes being cast, no votes were pre-registered on\n\n\n10 A \"zero tape\" is run on the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to ensure no votes reside in the\n\nsystem.

The eSlate system is comprised of several\ndistinct components.\nThe Ballot Origination Software System (\"BOSS\") is used by election officials to define and create\nindividualized electronic ballots. Data is entered once into BOSS and then flows through all\ncomponents of the eSlate system.\nThe Mobile Ballot Box (\"MBB\") is a reusable, portable flash memory card. It is used to store and\ntransfer election information. When inserted into the Judge's Booth Controller, the MBB supplies\nelection information and ballot styles, it stores an electronic representation of how votes were cast.\nOnce voting has concluded the MBB is removed and its contents are tallied by the Tally software.\nThe Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") is the \"brain\" that manages the system, enabling poll workers\nto know which voting booths are in use at any time. The JBC issues access codes for the voters' use.\nIt can control up to 12 daisy-chained eSlate units.\neSlate refers to the system generally and to the device that voters use to cast ballots, unless using\npaper ballots, in which case Ballot Now is used. The eSlate may be equipped with a disabled access\nunit (\"DAU\") for use by disabled voters. The eSlate units are physically connected to the JBC,\nwhich stores cast-vote records.\nTally is a software application that reads, stores, and tabulates the cast-vote records from the MBB\n(the portable flash card that transferred the cast-vote records from the JBC). Tally tabulates all early\nvoting, absentee, and election day results, and produces various reports.\nRally is a software application that is capable of reading, storing, and transferring cast-vote data\nfrom polling places or collection centers with respect to early returns.\nThe System for Election Records and Verification Operations (\"SERVO\") software is an election\nrecords archiving and asset management system. SERVO is designed to recover data from\nequipment in the case of a lost or damaged MBB. SERVO also is designed for various recount\npurposes.\nBallot Now is a digital-scan paper ballot system that manages the printing, scanning, and resolution\nof mailed-in paper ballots. It also records the electronic cast vote records to an MBB to be read and\ntabulated with Tally.\n\n\nPressley v.

Because of the previously noted, highly improbable statistical anomalies l3 , the duplicate\n\nBallot by Mail entries, and the fact that there are more ballots than number of voters for Early\n\nVoting (overvotes), Contestant requested a manual recount of the District 4 Election with the goal\n\nof reconciling the discrepancies.\n\n48.        Contestant claims the recount evidence and findings are critically material to this case\n\nand the allegations are legally relevant to this election contest.\n\n49.    The recount failed to only count legal votes because \"images of ballots cast\" were not\n\nprovided and counted.      Printing the \"cast vote record\" or \"CVR\" data files was in essence\n\nreprinting the previous electronically counted results obtained on Election night. A CVR prints\n\ndata from a data file to a template; it does not count the \"images of ballots cast\" - it merely\n\nreprints the tally on separate sheets of paper. It was not recounting the source data of the \"images\n\nof ballots cast,\" and as such it is not a meaningful check on the original count. 14 Using the CVR\n\n\n13 See Appendix 8.\n14 The Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (All dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.) In its 2014 Electronic Voting System\nProcedures bulletin, posted online at\n                           the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot\nimages. See, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8 - Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEC § 214.071):\n1. The candidate requesting a recount may request that the recount be done electronically or\n        manually.\n2. For an electronic recount, the persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n        also authorized to be present as the election media are reloaded into the central accumulator\n        system.\n3. For a manual recount of a DRE election, the Recount Coordinator shall organize the printing of\n        cast vote records (ballot images) for the affected race or issue.\n\n\nPressley v.

At the same meeting, Dr. Pressley stated that the pre-printing of recount records and\n\nstarting the recount process was also a violation of 213.016 and 213.009(c), respectively.           A\n\nmember of the recount committee responded to one of the recount watchers: \"They started all this\n\non Sunday [January 4,2015].\"\n\n57.    Pressley warned the County Clerk that the irregularities, of not printing the images of\n\n\n\n17 For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that subchapter are Sec. 52.003 and Sec.\n52.070.\nSec. 52.003.

Printing the CVR data files was in essence\n\nreprinting the previous electronically counted results obtained on Election night. A CVR is a\n\nprinting of a data file to a template - it does not \"count\" the images of ballots - it merely reprints\n\nthe tally on separate sheets of paper. It was not recounting the source data of the \"images of\n\n                                                                                    18\nballots cast,\" and as such it is not a meaningful check on the original count.           Using the CVR\n\ninstead of ballot image also appears to violate Texas Election Code 214.049 (e): \"If electronic\n\nvoting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original ballot, rather than the duplicate\n\n18 Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (All dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.)

Pressley requested those numbers be reconciled with the recount\n\nresults, because of Early Voting voter lists discrepancies identified in the Recount Petition.

The request was also specifically made prior to the recount\n\nin the Amended Petition for Recount (See Attached Appendix 11, Amended Petition for Recount.)\n\n\nPressley v.

Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.012, the committee chair prepared a report of the vote\n\ncount. The Travis County Clerk and the Director of the Elections Division repeatedly informed\n\nDr. Pressley that \"it was not the scope of the Recount\" to reconcile the ballots with the number of\n\nvoters. The chair wrote, \"The numbers of voters matched the number of ballots cast,\" and signed\n\nthe report (See Attached Appendix 14, \"Recount Affidavit of Jay Brim\"). During the Recount, the\n\nnumbers of voters on voter lists were not publicly reconciled with the ballots recounted by the\n\nchair.   Dr. Pressley commented to the chair, \"Matching the numbers was not supposedly done\n\ntoday,\" and no explanation was provided by the chair.\n\n62.      On January 5, 2015, the Mayor of Austin and City Clerk approved Contestant's amended\n\npetition requesting a manual recount of actual stored \"images ofballois cast.,,19 Contestant's amended\n\npetition included a request to reconcile the ballots cast with the number of voters documented on the sign\n\nin sheets and combination fomls for District 4 for the countywide polling locations and Precincts to\n\nensure accurate reporting of results. The number of voters recorded and the number of votes recorded\n\ndid not match.\n\n         Ballot by Mail Ballots Are The Only Legal Ballots That Are Properly Preserved\n\n63.       This is why printing the \"images of the ballots cast\" is critical. The ballot in the General\n\nElection was very different (8 candidates) from the ballot in the Run Off (2 candidates). If some\n\nmemory cards or counting software were reused by mistake, then the \"images of the ballots cast\" will\n\ninstantly and unmistakably distinguish the true votes from the illegal votes. This is the intent of the\n\n19 Texas Election Code §213.016.\nSec. 213.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING\nELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES. During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct\nrecording electronic voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\nrequired to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many committee members\nmust be present during the printing of the images. Each candidate is entitled to be present and to\nhave representatives present in the same number as prescribed by Section 213.0 13(b) for a recount\nduring the printing of the images.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.24\n                                                                                                             362\n\f\"images of ballots cast\" language of the law. Which ballots were counted is the question that can be\n\nanswered only by review of the \"images of ballots cast.\"\n\n64.       The mandatory nature of this requirement becomes clear in context.\n\n          [W]e believe that violations of certain recording provisions by election clerks can\n          certainly undermine the purpose of the election code and obscure the true will of the\n          qualified voters.\n\nGonzalez v. Villareal, 251 S.W.3d at 778\n\n65.       Failure to retain \"image of ballots cast,\" \"ballots\" and or \"ballot originals\" is precisely such\n\na violation, because there is no clear and unequivocal record of the voter's intent, absent such an\n\nImage.\n\n66.          Given the facts and the election mistakes made by Travis County election officers, all of the\n\n4,023 votes that show to be cast in person, are in question and must be verified. Therefore, we ask the\n\nCourt to compel Travis County to print and tally the \"images of ballots cast\" for the District 4 Run Off\n\nso the court may ascertain whether the outcome as shown by the canvass is not the tme outcome\n\nbecause illegal votes were counted. The list of the 4,023 voters and their Voter ID' s are provided in\n\nAppendix 15.\n\n67.       The recount included the Ballot by Mail ballots, and those specific results for Pressley and\n\nCasar were determined. 20 Ballot by Mail Votes were cast in seventeen of the eighteen precincts of\n\nDistrict 4. 21 Pressley received 240 votes and Casar received 240 votes of the 480 total votes cast\n\nfor either candidate for the Ballot by Mail ballots. Pressley received exactly 50% of the votes.\n\n68.       The Ballot by Mail result is very different from the 33.3 and 33.8% Pressley is reported to\n\nha ve received for early voting and election day voting from the \"cast vote records\" - a variation\n\nfrom mail-in votes and non-mail-in votes of almost 20% (See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount\n\n20   See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount Results.\"\n21   One precinct, with a population of a single voter, showed no votes.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.25\n                                                                                                             363\n\fResults\").\n\n69.    The only actual \"ballots\" that were preserved and counted during the recount show\n\nPressley and Casar split the vote exactly in half. Moreover, 10 of the 18 precincts showed 50% or\n\nmore of the vote for Pressley. The Ballot by Mail ballots that were cast for either candidate (total\n\nof 480 votes) were over 10% of the total ballots cast for the Run Off election.\n\n70.          The 480 Ballot by Mail ballots are the only\" ballots,\" as that term is defined in the\n\nElection Code, which were available and counted during the recount.            Therefore, the election\n\nshould have been re-canvassed only with the 480 Ballot by Mail \"ballots\" and not the results\n\nincluding the 4,023 illegally recounted \"cast vote records.\"\n\n71.    This is an additional reason for the court to compel the Travis County Clerk to comply with\n\nTEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.016 22 and 214.049 (e?3 to print and count the statutorily required \"images\n\nof ballots cast\" and ascertain whether the previous outcome of the election is not the true outcome.\n\n72.    On January 6, 2015, the recount was conducted and completed. After the recount, the\n\ntotals were unchanged as compared to the original canvassed results.           The totals were Laura\n\nPressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n73.    Reconciliation of voter signatures on rolls at polling locations and total ballots cast has not\n\nbeen completed. An election contest is the only available remedy to explore the discrepancy\n\nbetween the number of ballots counted and the number of voter names and signatures in the\n\nprecincts.\n\n74.    The sum total of all voting irregularities identified herein exceeds the number of votes by\n\n\n\n22 \"PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING ELECTRONIC\nVOTING MACHINES\"\n23\"If electronic voting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original ballot, rather than\nthe duplicate of the original ballot, shall be counted.\"\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.26\n                                                                                                         364\n\fwhich the election was decided.\n\n75.     If no \"images of ballots cast\" can be retrieved, printed and counted, Travis County cannot\n\nunequivocally determine the outcome of the election. The Court may order each of the more than\n\n4,000 voters who voted in person to testify as to how they voted, pursuant to Texas Election Code\n\nSec. 221.010. \"SECONDARY            EVIDENCE        FOR UNAVAILABLE              BALLOTS.

In the alternative, if Travis County cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\" to be printed\n\nand counted, then Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and\n\nthe election is void. As a matter oflaw, the Court must therefore order a new election. TEX. ELEC.\n\nCODE § 232.041. 24\n\n                                 VII. PETITION TIMELY FILED\n\n77.

VIOLATIONS OF LAW\n\n Texas Election Code Violation\n\n Lack of Notice of Relocation of Polling Place\n\n 82.    The facts asserted above are included herein by reference. Contestant claims that voters\n\n were disenfranchised due to the failure of Travis County to provide and/or maintain an adequate\n\n notice at the general election polling place (Highland Mall and other voting locations identified\n\n herein) detailing the relocation of the polling place to the Travis County offices for the runoff\n\n election in December 2014. Such failure to provide notice of relocation of the polling place for\n\n the runoff election is a violation of Texas Election Code § 43.062. Section 43.062 states:\n\n       Sec. 43.062. NOTICE AT PREVIOUS POLLING PLACE. If the location of the\n       polling place for an election precinct is different from the location used for the\n       precinct in the preceding election ordered by the same authority, the authority\n       responsible for giving notice of the election shall, if possible, post notice at the\n       entrance to the previous polling place stating that the location has changed and\n       providing the location of the new polling place.\n\n       Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 802, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1,2001.\n\n Contestant seeks an order requiring a vacation of the runoff election and an order requiring a\n\n properly noticed runoff election be held forthwith.\n\n\n\nFailure to Provide \"Images of Ballots Cast\"\n\n83.     Contestant asserts that the December 2014 runoff fails to comply with the statutory\n\nrequirements of the Texas Election Code Chapters 128 and 213. Section 128.001 states:\n\n       Sec. 128.001. COMPUTERIZED VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.28\n                                                                                                     366\n\f       (a) The secretary of state shall prescribe procedures to allow for the use of a\n       computerized voting system. The procedures must provide for the use of a\n       computerized voting system with:\n             (1) multiple voting terminals for the input of vote selections on the ballot\n             presented by a main computer; and\n             (2) a main computer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection,\n             ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\n\n\n84.    Section 2l3.016 states:\n\n       Sec. 2l3.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT\n       RECORDING ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES.\n\n       During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct recording electronic\n       voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\n       required to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many\n       committee members must be present during the printing of the images. Each\n       candidate is entitled to be present and to have representatives present during the\n       printing of the images in the same number as Section 2l3.0l3(b) prescribes for\n       watchers for a recount.\n\n       Added by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 583, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1,2003.\n       Amended by:\n               Acts 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., Ch. 1235 (S.B. 1970), Sec. 22, eff. September\n       1,2009.\n\n\n 85.    As asserted above, the Travis County Clerk cannot provide \"images of ballots cast\" for\n\n purposes of a recount in the December runoff election as required by the Texas Election Code.\n\n Because the Travis County Clerk cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\", the ballots cast on the\n\n electronic voting machines cannot be verified. Contestant seeks an order from this case vacating\n\n the December 2014 runoff election. Since the only verifiable votes in the December runoff are\n\n the ballots by mail, said votes resulting in a tie in the runoff, Contestant seeks an order from this\n\n Court directing that another runoff election be conducted and that the Travis County Clerk\n\n provide \"images of ballots cast\" in such a runoff election for purposes of allowing all affected\n\n parties to verify the results of said runoff in compliance with the above-referenced provisions of\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.29\n                                                                                                         367\n\f the Texas Election Code.\n\n\n\n Violation ofSection 2 of the Federal Voting Rights Act\n\n 86.    Contestant asserts that failure to provide notice at the general election polling place of the\n\n relocation of the polling place for the runoff has a disproportionate impact on minority voters in\n\n violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 42 U.S.c. §§ 1973b(f), 1973l(c)(3» (now 52\n\n USC 10303) bars voting discrimination against certain language minorities--specifically, persons\n\n of American Indian, Asian American, Native Alaskan, and Spanish heritage. Members of the\n\n protected class of Spanish heritage in Precincts 142 and 156 (Appendix 1) were disenfranchised\n\n by the confusion created by the lack of notice of the change in polling place for the December\n\n 2014 runoff election. Contestant seeks an injunction from this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.c.\n\n § 1983 vacating the runoff election and requiring a new runoff election forthwith.\n\n\n\n           IX. MOTION TO MODIFY STANDARD DISCOVERY PROCEDURES\n\n87.     Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 191.1, Contestants request that the Court sign\n\nan order shortening the time allowed for Contestee to comply with the discovery requests set forth\n\nbelow to no more than fifteen days.\n\n88.

RESPONSE TO SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS\n\n                                           Introduction\n\n91.    Dr. Pressley has found indisputable election irregularities and mistakes that were made in\n\nconducting the District 4 election held on December 16,2014 that show the outcome as shown by\n\nthe final canvass is not accurate and she is bringing this election contest. Because illegal votes were\n\ncounted, eligible voters were prevented from voting, legal votes were not counted, and Travis\n\nCounty election officers made errors and mistakes, Dr. Pressley is asking, pursuant to Section\n\n221.003 (a), for the \"court to ascertain whether the outcome of the District 4 Run Off election, as\n\nshown by the canvass, is not the true outcome.\"      If a contestant is prevented by the county clerk\n\nfrom proving the actual number of legal votes by the clerk's act of not preserving or requiring or\n\ncounting images of the ballots actually cast there is no way to conclude the clerk reported the true\n\noutcome . Without the images of the actual ballots there is not a true outcome and the run-off\n\nelection must be repeated preserving the images of the ballots cast as provided and required by state\n\nlaw.\n\n92.    Contestee alleges Dr. Pressley is attacking the entire state-wide electronic-voting system. In\n\nfact, the contest is limited solely to the discrete errors made by the Travis County Clerk's office in\n\nthis single election. All counties are capable of complying with the law and preserving images of\n\nthe actual ballots cast by a voter. Travis county just elected to ignore that law and the sound public\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.3l\n                                                                                                          369\n\fpolicy behind it. It cannot certify a true outcome by reason of its own misconduct in this election\n\nthat is at issue in this case.\n\n93.       Weaknesses in the Travis County Election systems are well known and have been\n\nextensively identified. Several years ago, Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir herself convened\n\na Travis County Clerk Election Study Group to evaluate Travis County's current voting system\n\nand             make             recommendations             for           future             systems.\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontentlimages/presentations_ articles/pdCtc _elections _E\n\nSG_Report_2009. pdf)        Clerk DeBeauvoir had determined that a study group was needed to\n\naddress public concerns about electronic voting and to ensure ample time to plan for an upgrade or\n\nreplacement of the existing system and \"its most significant recommendation is that Travis County\n\nmove away from an all-electronic voting system to one that offers electronically-counted paper\n\nballots.\" Clerk DeBeauvoir is on record stating the need to redesign and replace Travis County's\n\nvoting                                                                                        systems:\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontent/images/presentations articles/pdf tc elections 2\n\n013.07.26 star.pdf and https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files120 13/09/Dana-Debeauvoir-STAR-\n\nVoting-System-Diagram.pdf and \"Three years ago, DeBeauvoir decided that something had to\n\nchange. \"1 said, 'Okay, I'm fed up. I'm going to design my own system. '\" Part of her frustration\n\nstemmed from complaints lodged against the county that she felt blamed officials for things\n\nbeyond      their   control.\"(   https://www.texastribune.org12014107/09/travis-county-forges-new-\n\nterritory-voting-machines/):\n\n94.       Given the specific voting irregularities outlined herein, Dr. Laura Pressley fully supports\n\nthe Clerk's search for a more accountable and election system.      One critical component that the\n\nTravis County system is lacking is that Texas Election Code allows for a manual recount using\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.32\n                                                                                                         370\n\f\"images of ballots cast.\" When Pressley requested a manual recount using \"images of ballots cast\"\n\nfor the District 4 Run Off election, Travis County is on record stating they cannot comply.\n\nInterestingly, in January 2015, Pressley was informed both by DeBeauvoir and former Travis\n\nCounty Judge Bill Aleshire that no other candidate in Travis County's history had requested a\n\nmanual recount of \"images of ballots cast.\" A review of reported cases shows no indication that\n\nany candidate in the state has requested such a statutorily-allowed recount. This contest, therefore,\n\nto the extent it decides issues regarding this mandate and this language, is a case of first\n.       .     25\nImpressIOn.\n\n\n\n The court will, of course, be guided by the Texas Supreme Court's view of statutory language,\n25\nwhich is not as fluid as that of federal courts or other state courts.\n\n       If the statutory text is unambiguous, a court must adopt the interpretation supported\n       by the statute's plain language unless that interpretation would lead to absurd results.\n       See Tune v. Tex. Dep't ofPub. Safety, 23 S.W.3d 358,363 (Tex.2000) (\"We must\n       enforce the plain meaning of an unambiguous statute.\"); RepublicBank Dallas, NA.\n       v. Interkal, Inc., 691 S.W.2d 605,607 (Tex.1985) (\"Unless a statute is ambiguous, we\n       must follow the clear language of the statute. \"); Brazos River Auth. v. City of\n       Graham, 163 Tex. 167,354 S.W.2d 99, 109 n. 3 (1962) (\"[O]perating as we are\n       under a strict theoretical division of governmental powers, it would take a bit of\n       doing on the part of the judiciary to say, in the absence of ambiguous and\n       uncertain statement or patent and manifest absurdity, that the Legislature\n       intended something different from the clear import of the words chosen by\n       it.. .. \"); Gilmore v. Waples, 108 Tex. 167, 188 S.W. 1037, 1039 (1916) (The literal\n       meaning of a statute may be disregarded \"only where it is perfectly plain that the\n       literal sense works an absurdity or manifest injustice.\").\n\nTexas Dep't ofProtective and Regulatory Services v.

Ed. 2d 355 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in the\njudgment).\n\n       This Court recognizes that legislative intent is best embodied in legislative language.\n       We recently cautioned that \"over-reliance on secondary materials should be avoided,\n       particularly where a statute's language is clear. If the text is unambiguous, we must\n       take the Legislature at its word and not rummage around in legislative minutiae.\"\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.33\n                                                                                                         371\n\f95.      With regard to the fact that Travis Count's use of one version of the Hart InterCivic\n\neSlate system may violate the Texas Election Code requirements for storing, retrieving, and\n\nprinting of \"images of ballots cast,\" we respectfully assert any regulatory redefinition equating\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" with \"cast vote records\" exceeds the statutory grant of authority.26 Given\n\nthat the term \"ballot\" is defined in the Texas Election Code and \"images of ballots cast\" is\n\nreferenced with regard to recounts and \"cast vote records\" are not, the Texas Election Code trumps\n\nthe Secretary of State's administrative definitions.\n\n96.      Addressing the various pieces of evidence that became available and the irregularities that\n\noccurred during the recount is important in the analysis and evaluation of this election contest.\n\nThe recount evidence is critically material to this case and the allegations are legally relevant to\n\nthis election contest. Moreover, it is in the recount failures that Travis County's failure to use\n\nequipment up to statutory standards becomes clear.\n\n97.          The legal question raised by an election contest is whether the outcome of the\n\ncontested District 4 election is not, or cannot be conclusively determined to be, the true outcome.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Pressley has found that illegal votes were counted, Travis County Elections\n\nDivision prevented eligible voters from voting, failed to count legal votes, and engaged in other\n\nirregularities that materially affected the election results. Moreover, because of the failure of\n\nTravis County to maintain \"images of ballots cast\", the outcome cannot be determined to be the\n\n         Faced with clear statutory language, \"the judge's inquiry is at an end.\" It may be a\n         widespread practice to mine the minutiae of legislative records to discern what\n         lawmakers had in mind, but as we have held, relying on these materials is verboten\n         where the statutory text is, as here, absolutely clear.\n26 \\Ve cannot construe the rule in a manner that is inconsistent with the statute. See, e.g.,\nCenterpoint Energy, Inc. v. Public Uti!. Comm'n, 143 S.W.3d 81,85 (Tex. 2004) (observing that\nrule is invalid if it violates statutory provision); Texas Workers' Compo Comm In v. Patient\nAdvocates, 136 S.W.3d 643, 657-58 (Tex. 2004)\nTex.1Ifut. Ins. Co. v. Vista CmZV. Afed. Ctr., LLP, 275 S.W.3d 538,557,2008 Tex. App. LEXIS\n8602,45 (Tex.

Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.34\n                                                                                                       372\n\ftrue outcome.\n\n                   Case Law Presented by Contestee is largely irrelevant\n\n                        Andrade v. NAACP, 345 S.W. 3d 1 (Tex. 2011)\n\n98.      Contestee Casar's      ORIGINAL ANS\\VER AND                SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS             TO\n\nCONTESTANT'S ORIGINAL CONTEST OF ELECTION references the Andrade v. NAACP\n\ncase, seeks to apply it to the instant case, and states that \"the Secretary of State's certification of\n\neSlate for use by Travis County did not violate equal protection rights of voters using electronic\n\nvoting system.\"\n\n99.        Contestee Casar misinterprets Contestant Dr. Pressley's claims in this case. She does not\n\nassert a claim of violation of equal protection as it relates to electronic voting systems. Rather,\n\nContestant Dr. Pressley asserts that illegal votes were counted, election officers prevented eligible\n\nvoters from voting, election officers failed to count legal votes, and election officers made mistakes\n\nthat resulted in an election outcome which is not the true outcome and did not preserve images of\n\nballots to be used as acheck on the computer results which prevented a determination that the election\n\nand the recount was a true outcome. Thus, the Andrade case is irrelevant.\n\n100.     Contestee Dr. Pressley's election contest claims were not asserted in Andrade v. NAACP\n\nand Dr. Pressley has been directly harmed by Travis County's conduct during the District 4\n\nelection and she has been directly harmed by the County's inability to ascertain the true outcome\n\nbecause \"ballots,\" \"original ballots\" and/or \"images of ballots cast\" cannot be counted.\n\n            Tex. Democratic Party v. Williams, 285 Fed. Appx. 194, 195 (5 th eire 2008)\n\n101.      In CONTESTEE'S           ORIGINAL ANSWER AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS TO\n\nCONTESTANT'S ORIGINAL CONTEST OF ELECTION he references Tex. Democratic Party\n\nv. Williams, and applies it to our case with regard to \"the eSlate did not violate voters' rights under\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.35\n                                                                                                          373\n\fthe First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\"\n\n102.       Contestee Casar misinterprets Contestant Dr. Pressley's claims in this case. She does not\n\nassert claims of violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as\n\nit relates to electronic voting systems.    Rather, Contestant Dr. Pressley asserts, illegal votes were\n\ncounted, election officers prevented eligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal\n\nvotes, and election officers made mistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true\n\noutcome and they did not preserve the images of ballots which is a possible function of the eSlate\n\nprogram.\n\n103.       Additionally, as a matter of law, Dr. Pressley claims that \"cast vote records\" do not meet the\n\nstatutory requirements of \"ballots,\" \"original ballots\" and/or \"images of ballots cast.\" Therefore, if\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" were not preserved, and thus cannot be retrieved, printed and counted,\n\nthen Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                p.36\n                                                                                                            374\n\f                                             Conclusion\n\n104.        Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Contestant requests the run-off election be\n\ndeclared void, a new run-off be held at which images of the ballots actually cast be preserved\n\nusing procedures compliant with the Texas Election Code for use in the event of a contest, the\n\nCourt award reimbursement for the cost of her election contest, recount fees, and that the Court\n\ngrant all other and further relief, in law and in equity, to which she may be entitled.\n\n                                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               David Rogers\n                                               LA W OFFICE OF DAVlD ROGERS\n\n\n\n                                       By:       lsi David Rogers\n                                               David A.

The\nphantom need asserted to move this case so fast that it prejudices my client's chance to fairly\npresent the case is strongly objected to and it just unnecessarily creates additional grounds for\nnecessitating an appeal which will delay the final decision even more, The pendency of this case is\nhaving no more of an effect on Mr. Casar that every litigant waiting for the procedures of a trial to\nwork their way and there is no evidence that the city is being adversely effected in any way. Frankly\nMr, Herring's tactical efforts to prevent Ms, Presley from having a fair opportunity to provide you\nwith all of the admissible evidence just affirms how important it is that I have the time to provide it\nto you.

I know that there are huge differences between\n\n18    what the law says for paper ballots and what the law\n\n19    says for electronic.           And I'd have to have the law in\n\n20    front of me, to make the distinction between the two.\n\n21         Q.     (BY MR.

That's what it look-- that's what a paper\n\n20    ballot looks like.         This is a representation of a paper\n\n21    ballot.     That's why it said it's by mail.\n\n22         Q.

I don't remember.       We'll have to look it up.\n\n 9    It might say on here,          someplace.     I don't remember.\n\n10          Q.    You don't remember.           Okay.\n\n11                        And as you updated the -- with the new\n\n12    versions of the eSlate system, did you have some group\n\n13    of scientists and election experts verify that there\n\n14    was        that the update was appropriate?\n\n15          A.    Yes.     We go through a procedure, through the\n\n16    Secretary of State's office; and the main verification\n\n17    is called \"hash code testing.\"\n\n18          Q.     That goes -- you do that every time you\n\n19    incorporate an update into your system; is that correct?\n\n20          A.    Every time.\n\n21          Q.    Okay.     Let's take a look at the          what does\n\n22    the Tally -- what does the Tally portion of the eSlate\n\n23    system do?        What is that function?\n\n24          A.

So-- but it's not the official tally,            correct?\n\n 7          A.     It's not-- no.\n\n 8          Q.    No.\n\n 9          A.     It is for unofficial results on election night.\n\n10          Q.    Got you.     Okay.    Now,   let me go back.     I forgot\n\n11    to ask you a question about Exhibit 13.\n\n12                      This is -- you'd say this was a tally of\n\n13    the mail-in votes,       correct?

DISCOVERY\n\n1.        The contestant intends that discovery be conducted under level three, a custom discovery\n\nplan for election contest devised with the approval of the court.\n\n                                                  II. SUMMARY\n\n2.        This contest is based on the facts that election irregularities, mistakes, manual, mechanical\n\nand electronic errors occurred with the election activities and tabulation of the votes that were cast\n\nusing the electronic voting machines during Early Voting and on Election Day for the December\n\n\n1\n  This 6th Amended Petition is filed in response to the Discovery production of Travis County and has more specific\nallegations pleaded. Also, this Sixth Amended Petition is filed in Response to Contestee Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar's\nAnswer and Special Exceptions to Contestant's Original Contest of Election, and the Court's order of Aprill3, 2015\nregarding those Special Exceptions, and Casar's Motion to Strike the Fifth Amended Petition.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.l\n                                                                                                                      860\n\f16, 2014 Joint Special Runoff Election for the District 4 Austin City Council City of Austin\n\nelection (referred to as the \"Runoff') and January 6, 2015 District 4 Austin City Council Recount\n\n(referred to as the \"Recount\").\n\n3.       There are numerous election irregularities in the administration and results tabulation of the\n\nRunoff election. Specifically, the most material issues are related to:\n\n            a. nine instances of corrupt Mobile Ballot Box errors during vote tabulation on election\n\n                 night at Central Counting,\n\n            b. missing data log entries in the vote tabulation systems, the Tally Audit and Ballot Now\n\n                 audit logs,\n\n            c. suspicious mathematical patterns observed in the Runoff Election results that show\n\n                 them to be erroneous and not credible,\n\n            d. Travis County election officers instructing election officers to not print and retain\n\n                 crucial, mandated election records listing specific vote results for each candidate in a\n\n                 race (Zero Tapes, Tally/Results tapes),\n\n            e. election equipment security seals that were improperly sealed, subsequently\n\n                 unsealed and replaced,\n\n            f.   not producing, counting and retaining statutorily required ballot images,\n\n            g. obstructing Contestant's official poll watchers at polling locations and Central\n\n                 Counting after the polls closed.\n\n4.      These violations materially affected the outcome of the election in that an inordinate\n\nnumber of election irregularities occurred and there was a lack of accountability of election\n\nofficers with regard to no printing of Zero Tapes, no printing of Results Tapes, denying office poll\n\nwatchers access to election activities, improperly sealed electronic devices, security breaches of\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                        p.2\n                                                                                                            861\n\fthe Tally vote tabulation system, corrupt Mobile Ballot Box entries, and Tally Audit log deletions.\n\nBecause of the erroneous reported election results, the egregious election irregularities, the missing\n\nelection records, possible criminal and fraudulent violations, the outcome of the Runoff cannot be\n\nknown.\n\n5.          Specifically, these violations caused illegal votes to be counted and election officers failed\n\nto count legal votes correctly. In addition, the pervasive and numerous election irregularities make\n\nit impossible to conclude that the reported results are the true outcome of the election. Finally,\n\nbecause no ballots, or images of ballots were preserved by the Office of the Travis County Clerk,\n\nDana DeBeauvoir, there are no ballots to count and no ballots to use to verify the electronic \"cast\n\nvote records\" in the Recount except for the paper Absentee/Mail-In ballots .\n\n6.          Section 221.0 12 of the Texas Election Code provides in pertinent part:\n\n           Sec. 221.012. TRIBUNAL'S ACTION ON CONTEST.\n           (a) If the tribunal hearing an election contest can ascertain the true outcome of\n           the election, the tribunal shall declare the outcome.\n\n            (b) The tribunal shall declare the election void if it cannot ascertain the true\n            outcome of the election.\n\n\n7.           \"A contestant seeking to have an election declared void under this provision must allege and\n\nprove that the true results of the election are impossible to ascertain.\" See City of La Grulla v.\n\nRodriguez, 415 S.

As will be presented below, many crucial election records for the 3,937 electronically cast\n\nballots in the Runoff 2 are missing or corrupted3 on the Travis County's Hart Voting System: Ballot\n\n\n2\n    Exhibit A, Runoff Recount Results showing Ballot by Mail ballots of 480, and Cast Vote Records (electronically cast\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                    p.3\n                                                                                                                          862\n\fimages, vote tabulation Tally Audit logs 4 , Zero Tapes 5 , Tally/Results tapes 6 •7 , Mobile Ballot Box\n\n       .\ncorruptwn · , 1mproper1y sea1ed secunty\n         89 .                        . sea1s 10r\n                                             C':\n                                                 votmg\n                                                    •\n                                                       eqmpment\n                                                          •     10\n                                                                   , etc.\n\n9.        The only legal ballots that have been retained, produced and recounted by Travis County,\n\nare the 480 votes cast on paper, Mail in Ballots (Exhibit 1). These ballots show an exact tie at 240\n\nballots cast as votes for Pressley and 240 ballots cast as votes for Casar (Exhibit 1).                Therefore,\n\nthe outcome of the election is a tie and neither Pressley nor Casar may be declared the victor.\n\n10.       Given the only retained ballots show an exact tie, along with the numerous mathematical\n\nanomalies observed with the Runoff election results, the statutory and mandated retention of important\n\nelection records is needed to determine the true outcome of the election. In the absence of these crucial\n\nelection records, the outcome cannot be known and this Honorable Court cannot ascertain the true\n\noutcome of the Runoff election between Pressley and Casar, and thus declare the Runoff election void\n\nand order a new election.\n\n                                                 III. PARTIES\n\n11.     Contestant Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis County,\n\nTexas. She was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Runoff Election on December\n\n16, 2014.\n\n12.     Contestee Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas. He was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Runoff Election on\n\n\n\nballots) of3,937.\n3\n  Exhibit B, Tally Audit logs showing missing entries and multiple \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB[Mobile Ballot Box]\" errors.\n4\n  Exhibit B, Tally Audit logs,\n5\n  Exhibit C, Judges' Booth Controller (JBC) Judge's Envelope, p. xxx, Zero Tapes missing\n6\n  Exhibit C, Judges' Booth Controller (JBC), Judge's Envelope cover states, \"DO NOT PRINT THE TALLY\"\n7\n  Exhibit D, Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir's Deposition regarding no Results tapes, p. 128, line 15.\n8\n  Exhibit B, Tally Audit Logs, Mobile Ballot Box corruption on pgs. 5, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29 and 42.\n9\n  Exhibit D, DeBeauvoir's deposition regarding MBB corruption errors, p. 98, lines 18-20, and p. 99, lines 4-9\n10\n   Exhibit E, Hart Voting System election equipment with improperly sealed security seals, election official signed\naffidavits.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                p.4\n                                                                                                                      863\n\fDecember 16, 2014.          The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar\n\nwas declared the victor by 1,291 votes. 11 A \"manual recount\" of all early voting, election day,\n\nprovisional, and mailed-in ballots was attempted on January 6, 2015.\n\n13.      The mail-in ballots were exactly tied between the candidates, at 240 each, for a total of 480\n\nvotes (Exhibit A). The attempted recount was a nullity and a full recount was made impossible in\n\nthat the attempted recount violated state law and the manual recount of the 3,937 electronically\n\ncast ballots (Exhibit A) was incorrectly performed 12 using of the \"cast vote records\" in lieu of\n\n\"images of ballots cast.\"         Based on the counting of \"cast vote records\" and mail in ballots, as\n\ncould be predicted, the invalid recount did not change the reported results of the election and the\n\noriginal declaration of Mr. Casar as the victor for the runoff election did not change.\n\n14.      Casar was sworn into office on January 6, 2014. He has been notified of the filing of this\n\naction by a delivery of a copy of this Petition in accordance with TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 21.003(b).\n\n\n                                     IV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n15.      Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                                      V. FACTS\n\n                              Numerous Irregularities in Counting of Votes\n\n16.      Many election irregularities, errors, mistakes occurred with regard to the counting,\n\ntabulation, and reporting of votes for the District 4 Austin City Council Runoff Election and the\n\n\n11\n   Exhibit F, Official December 16, 2014 Runoff Cumulative Election Results.\n12\n  Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred did not satisfy\nstatutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a statutory manual recount as defined by the\nTexas Election Code 128.001(a)2, 213.016, 214.049(e), 213.016.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                    p.5\n                                                                                                                             864\n\fOfficial Recount. Many of these unexplained gaps in security and defect vote counts at a very\n\nminimum made fraud possible and make ruling out fraud an impossibility.\n\nUnnatural Mathematical Patterns Raises an Inference That the Reported Runoff Results are\n\nErroneous-November General Election and December Runoff Results Are the Same\n\n17.           The November 4, 2014 General Election for the District 4 Austin City Council City of\n\nAustin Election was comprised of 8 candidates and the December 2014 Runoff was comprised of 2\n\ncandidates (Pressley vs Casar).              A statistical analysis of the results of the election showed\n\nmathematical anomalies with the General Election and the Runoff.

Voters m the top nme (9) precincts m the City of Austin District 4 election compnse\n\nroughly 80% of the total voters in the Runoff (as documented by Exhibit G). 13 The ratio of\n\nprecinct level votes that the Contestant received compared to Contestee is the same ratio in the\n\nNovember General Election (8 candidates) as it was in the December Runoff Election (2\n\ncandidates), 35% vs 35% respectively. 14\n\n\n\n13\n     Exhibit G, Comparison Results, p. 1.\n14\n     Exhibit G, Comparison Results, p. 1.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                         p.6\n                                                                                                            865\n\f19.      In addition, the average of the percentages the Contestant received in the unweighted\n\nprecincts compared to Contestee, in the November General Election and the December Runoff, are\n\nalso equal at 35% and 35%, respectively. The fact that so many precincts showed exactly the\n\nsame and unchanged results for the General Election and the Runoff is sufficient to raise an\n\ninference that the reported results are erroneous.\n\n20.      The summary analysis (Exhibit G, p. 1) of the precinct level voting results for the General\n\nElection 15 and the precinct level results for the Runoff Election, 16 show very unusual and unique\n\nmathematical patterns and anomalies. This analysis reveals the Runoff results are erroneous and\n\nare a result of counting and tabulation errors committed by Travis County and thus the outcome of\n\nthe election cannot be determined.\n\n21.      Reviewing Travis County Voter election results for the General and Runoff Elections,\n\nthere was an overall attrition of over 4,000 voters from the General and Runoff elections. The\n\noccurrence of duplicated relative results for Pressley and Casar for the General and Runoff\n\nElection shows the results are strictly isolated to the District 4 Pressley vs Casar race, are\n\nerroneous, and are indicative of errors committed by Travis County in the vote collection and/or\n\ntabulation and clearly raises an inference that the reported results are not accurate.\n\n22.      For voters in just the top 9 precincts, there was an attrition of at least 600 voters (who\n\nvoted for either Pressley or Casar) between the General and the Runoff Elections24 · The unique\n\noccurrence that the results remain unchanged between Pressley's City Council General and Runoff\n\nis not correct.\n\n23.      From 2003 - 2014, a total of eleven races have resulted in a City of Austin City Council\n\n15\n   Exhibit H, Official 2014 General Election Results by precinct, self-authenticating public record, website for the Travis\nCounty Clerks' Election Results: http://www.traviscountyclerk.org/eclerk/Content.do?code=E.l\n16\n   Exhibit I, Official Runoff Election Results cumulative, and by precinct, self-authenticating public record, website for\nthe Travis County Clerks' Election Results: http://www.traviscountyclerk.org/eclerk/Content.do?code=E.l\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                     p.7\n                                                                                                                              866\n\fRunoff. 17 The graph below shows the ranges and standard deviations of the four, weighted and\n\nunweighted precinct results, values for those 11 races (similarly calculated as the Pressley race).\n\n24.      Furthermore, compared to the Pressley vs Casar race, no race in 11 years shows such a\n\ntight distribution with a standard deviation of0.06%. Ten races have greater than lOx the standard\n\ndeviation (0.67% or higher) and three races show greater than 100x the standard                                                        deviation\n\n(7.05% or higher).\n\n                         Comparison of           Retums for all Austin City      Run Off Races\n                           G.eru\\'ral Eledlonvs Run Off (Rimse and Standard Oeviatkm Shown)\n\n                                      f'<t ;.., !\"\"\"\"\"''thl«il\n                            GlOI'Ie<•l <l¥uo<11\n\n                            i!lu\" OOI'c;t.v\n                            l!t.m\n\n\n                                                  c::::J\n                                              'i,i)• f',U,.   >.D • LH'l>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            Q\n                                                                        >-.!>·(Pa\"i\n\n\n\n\n                        l'r<!SM$V                                           S.oyt     Almanu   1:1'*$'11           Oilril11\n                          <t0l4      ;!01.4       ({114                     lOtJt      2014     lOlA       1:000   200$.      tOO$\n\n\n\n\nNo other Council race in the history of electronic voting in the City of Austin for Council races\n\nfrom 2003 - 2014 has shown such a tight distribution between a General and a Runoff Elections\n\nand this fact strengthens the inference that the results are erroneous.

Because so many high volume District 4 precincts showed exactly the same percentage\n\nresults for Pressley and Casar, it is possible mistakes were made with the saving, loading and/or\n\ncounting the votes on the memory cards (Mobile Ballot Boxes).

See Exhibit N for\n\nduplicate Ballot by Mail Entries.\n\n30.      Once duplicate BBM's were removed from the voter rolls, 2,622 unique voter names\n\nremained that voted in Early Voting according to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that\n\nwere distributed prior to Election Day, December 16, 2014.\n\n31.      Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for Greg\n\nCasar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number of ballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. The unknown extra 80 ballots are distributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4\n\nRace (One precinct, with one eligible voter, showed no votes.). 26 See table below.\n\n32.      The pervasiveness of the Early Voting discrepancies in 15 precincts are evidence of\n\nsystemic errors occurring in the counting. Thus the Early Voting tabulation accuracy cannot be\n\nrelied on to determine the outcome of the election.\n\n33.      The issue of the mismatch between the number of individuals who voted and the number of\n\nballots cast, is indicative of several known and documented scenarios of errors and security\n\nbreaches that can occur with the Hart Electronic Voting Systems 27 •\n\n\n\n\n25\n   Exhibit N, Duplicate Ballot by Mail entries reported in Travis County's 24hr Early Voting Rolls\n26\n   Exhibit 0, Early Voting Discrepancies, more ballots than voters.\n27\n   Exhibit P, California Secretary of State Source Code Review of the Hart Expert and Exhibit S, affidavit declaration by\nDr. Jefferey Jacobson, Ph.D. regarding thelnterCivic Voting System:\nhttp://pubs.cs.rice.edu/sites/pubs.cs.rice.edu/files/Source%20Code%20Review%20ofl/o20the%20Hart%20InterCivic%20\nVoting%20System. pdf\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.JO\n                                                                                                                            869\n\f                                                Early Voting Dist:repandes\n\n                                          Total Ballots Cast   Voters Names per            Ballot\n                                 Pet      per Canvass and      Early Voting Roll<;      Discrepancy\n                                              Recount            from County            (Over votes}\n\n                                156              431                  42.2                   9\n                                2.22             319                  307                    12\n                                135              271                  2.64                   7\n                                139--            2.70                 265                    5\n                                140              233                  2.28                   5\n                                2.17             2.16                 2.05                   11\n                                149--            195                  191                    4\n                                133--            149                  145                    4\n                                164--            llfi                 113                    3\n                                2.60---          108                  103                    5\n                                142--            86                    83                    3\n                                2.09--           81                    77                    4\n                                2.23--           68                    66                    2.\n                                2.58--           59                    55                    4\n                                2.68--           59                    57                    2\n                                211--             24                   25                    -1\n                                2.24--            16                   16                    0\n\n\n34.        These tabulation irregularities also show the reported Runoff results for the Pressley/Casar\n\nrace are in question and are erroneous.\n                                                                               28\n35.        According to expert, Dr. Jefferey Jacobson, Ph.D.                        ,\n\n\n           The patterns Dr. Pressley found in the vote data are suspicious enough to warrant\n           further analysis and testing, especially in light of the numerous election irregularities\n           and given the security weaknesses in the Hart InterCivic voting system.\n\n36.        The previously noted, highly unlikely mathematical patterns associated with the 3,643\n\nvotes cast in the top 9 precincts, along with the Early Voting discrepancies, strongly suggests that\n\nthe electronically cast and counted votes in the Runoff cannot be relied in determining the true\n\noutcome of the election because there are no true ballot images to verify the voters' intent.\n\nContestant alleges the counting errors-in tabulating the top 9 precincts (3,643 votes) and the\n\ncounting errors in tabulating the Early Votes (2,701 votes)-committed by Travis County caused\n\n\n28\n     ExhibitS, Expert affidavit and declaration by Dr. Jeffrey Jacobson, Ph.D.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                  p.ll\n                                                                                                              870\n\fthese votes to be counted incorrectly and prevents knowing or ascertaining the true outcome of the\n\nelection.\n\n          B. Election Irregularities, Mistakes and Possibility of Fraud Makes Results Invalid\n\n37.        Travis County election officers committed numerous mistakes and election law violations\n\nrelated to all of the 3,937 electronically cast votes in the District 4 Runoff that materially affected\n\nthe outcome of the election.          For these specific electronically cast votes, Travis County failed to\n\nadhere to critical election rules, counting procedures, and security protocols as outlined in the\n\nTexas Constitution, the Texas Election Code, the Texas Secretary of States Procedure/Advisories,\n\nand the Federal Election Commission's Voting System's Standards, and the Hart Voting System\n\nrequirements.        Violations that materially affected the outcome of the election are outlined in\n\nchronological order as they occurred on Election Day and during the Recount in the following\n\nrespects:\n\n         1.   Not printing Zero Tape Reports\n\n38.        The Texas Secretary of State29 and Hart InterCivic Manuals 30 require the printing of Zero\n\nTape Reports during Early Voting and on Election Day at each precinct/polling location. Zero\n\nTape Reports are defined by the Texas Secretary of State as \"A Zero Tape is the tape that is\n\nprinted when the voting machine is first set up at the polls. It is called a Zero Tape since all\n\ncontests or propositions should have zero votes next to each name or question.\" Exhibit J, p. 13\n\nand 35.\n\n39.        According to the Texas Secretary of State's Election Advisory No. 2012-03(6)(g)(vi), for\n\n \"Opening the Polls:\n      vi. 1. At a minimum print one zero tape from each applicable device, as follows: The\n\n29\n     Exhibit J, Texas Secretary of State 2012-03 and June 2014 Electronic Voting Procedures Advisories.\n30\n     Exhibit M, Hart Training Manual\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.l2\n                                                                                                              871\n\f        presiding judge, an election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or more watchers\n        are present, shall sign the zero tape. 2. Maintain zero tapes in a secure location to be\n        returned with election materials (i.e. Ballot Box #4 or other secure means designated by the\n        general custodian of election records).\" (emphasis added)\n\n40.     According to Hart's Voting System Support Procedures Training Manual Exhibit J, p. 108,\n\n\"The \"Zero Tape\" report displays the contests and options [candidates] available on the ballot( s)\n\nfor this polling place. It is proof that the JBC has no votes cast on it the first day of Early Voting\n\nand/or the start of Election Day.\" emphasis added.\n\n41.     Travis County received a waiver from the Secretary of State granting permission to not\n\nprint Zero Tapes for the November 41h General Election because of the extensive number of races\n\nand candidates for the General Election. The Secretary of State did not provide a waiver granting\n\npermission to not print Zero Tapes for the December 16, 2014 Runoff and Special Election which\n\nhad a very small number of races and candidates (Austin Mayor, Council Members, AISD and\n\nACC Trustees).\n\n42.     Michael Winn, Travis County Elections Division Director, in a phone call, relayed to\n\nContestant on December 15, 2014, they were instructing election judges to not print Zero Tapes at\n\nthe beginning of Early Voting and to not print Zero Tapes on Election Day for the Runoff.\n\nReview of Discovery documents provided by Travis County, no Zero Tapes (showing the number\n\nof votes present on the Hart Voting equipment for each candidate when the polls open) were\n\nprinted during Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election Day of the Runoff. This\n                                                                                              31\nis evidenced by the JBC Report Envelope produced by Travis County, Exhibit C.\n\n43.     Travis County disregarded the printing Zero Tape Reports and the Hart InterCivic\n\noperational procedures and the retention of crucial election records mandated by the Texas\n\n31\n Exhibit C, JBC Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Zero Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                              p.l3\n                                                                                                                872\n\fSecretary of State. As a result, as the Hart Training Manual (Exhibit M) states, there is no ''proof\n\nthat the JBC has no votes cast on it the first day of Early Voting and/or the start of Election Day\"\n\n(emphasis added) at the Countywide Polling locations the Runoff.\n\n44.         A critical election security protocol for retaining key election records was ignored.                This\n\nundermines the claimed DRE results, (3,937) electronically cast ballots, for the District 4 race\n\nbecause there is no \"proofthat the JBC has no votes cast on it the first day of Early Voting and/or\n\nthe start of Election Day.\" The Travis County officers violations affected the outcome of the\n\nelection because votes may have remained on the voting equipment (Mobile Ballot Boxes\n\n(MBB's), eSlates and JBC) and as a result the court cannot ascertain the true outcome of the\n\nelection.\n\n          2. Not printing Results/Tally Tape Reports\n\n45.         The Texas Secretary of State also mandates the printing of Results/Tally Tape Reports on\n\nElection Day at each precinct/polling location. 32 Tally/Results Tape Reports are defined by the\n\nTexas Secretary of State as \"A Results Tape is the tape that is printed when the polls close. It is\n\ncalled a Results tape since all contests and propositions are listed and have the resulting votes next\n\nto each name or question.\" Exhibit J, p. 12 and 35.\n\n46.    According to the Texas Secretary of State's Election Advisory No. 2012-03(6)(k)(iii)\nExhibit J, for\n\n \"Closing the Polls:\"\n       iii. After the polls have been closed on Election Day, the precinct election officials shall\n       print out, at a minimum, two copies of the results tape from each applicable device and\n       secure the voting device against further use. (Warning do not print the results tape during\n       Early Voting; this includes the last day of Early Voting). 1. The presiding election judge,\n       an election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or more watchers are present,\n       shall sign the results tape(s). 2. The copies of the results tape(s) shall be distributed as\n\n32\n     Exhibit J, Texas Secretary of State 2012-03 and June 2014 Electronic Voting Procedures Advisories.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                     p.l4\n                                                                                                                        873\n\f        follows: a. Envelope #3 this is delivered to the presiding election judge; and b. Ballot Box\n        #4 (or other secure means designated) that is delivered to the general custodian of election\n        records, along with other election media and materials.\" Emphasis added.\n\n47.     Similarly as noted above, Travis County received a waiver from the Secretary of State\n\ngranting permission to not print Results/Tally Tape Reports for the November 41h General Election\n\nbecause of the extensive number of races and candidates for the General Election. 33 The Secretary\n\nof State did not provide a waiver granting permission to not print Results Tapes for the December\n\n16, 2014 Runoff and Special Election which had a very small number of races and candidates\n\n(Austin Mayor, Council Members, AISD and ACC Trustees).\n\n48.     Michael Winn, Travis County Director of Elections also relayed to Contestant on\n\nDecember 15, 2014, that election officers were instructed to not print Tally/Results Tapes at the\n\nclose of the polls on Election Day. A review of Discovery documents provided by Travis County,\n\nshows no Results Tapes were printed or signed by election officers on Election Day of the Runoff.\n34\n\n\n\n49.     Travis County produced actual envelopes the election officers used to store official election\n\nrecords. 35 On the front of each of the election judges' JBC Report Envelopes (where polling\n\nlocation election records are stored and returned), were the instructions, \"DO NOT PRINT THE\n\nTALLY.\" 36\n\n50.     In addition, in Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir's deposition (Exhibit D, p. 128, 13-\n\n15), she confirms election judges were instructed to not print the Tally/Results tapes that the Texas\n\n33\n   Exhibit T, Texas Secretary of State Waiver for General Election, Nov. 4th 2015.\n34\n   Exhibit C, JBC Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.\n35\n   Exhibit C, JBC Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.\n36\n   Exhibit C, JBC Report Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations. On the cover of the\nJBC Report Envelope, instructions to election officers clearly state, \"DO NOT PRINT THE TALLY.\"\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.l5\n                                                                                                                         874\n\fSecretary of State requires.\n\n51.    Without Results/Tally Tape Reports, there is no proof of the vote totals each candidate\n\nreceived during the election, prior to the election materials (eSlates, JBC' s and MBB' s) being\n\ntransferred to Central Counting for electronic tabulation.\n\n52.    The Results/Tally Tapes are an essential backup election record of the vote and they help\n\nensure the electronically cast 3,937 votes results are consistent with subsequent Central Counting\n\ncomputer tabulation results. A critical election security protocol for retaining key election records\n\nwas ignored by Travis County and thus invalidates the results for the (3,937) electronically cast\n\nballots for the District 4 race because there is no proof that the JBC had no votes cast on it\n\nerroneously for the Runoff or that there were computer corruption issues at Central Counting that\n\nskewed the true will of the voters in the Runoff.\n\n53.    The lack of retention of the Results/Tally tape further highlight the fact the Runoff results\n\nare erroneous, cannot be trusted due to corruption errors, and cannot be validated with retained\n\nelection records, and so many security protocols were violated. These irregularities have caused\n\nthe true outcome, of the 3,937 electronically cast votes in the Runoff, to not be known.\n\n\n\n      4.Contestant's Official Poll Watchers Were Denied Access on Election Night- Four Counts\n\n      of Criminal Violations Committed by Travis County Election Officer\n\n54.    Two of Contestant's Official Poll Watchers were denied access to and were prevented from\n\nsigning Results/Tally Tapes. Rae Nadler-Olenick and Paul Williams were official poll watchers\n\nfor the Pressley Campaign and they were enied access to Results/Tally Tapes on December 16,\n\n2014 at polling location Randalls at Braker/Research Hwy 183 and Gus Garcia Recreation Center,\n\nrespectively.\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.l6\n                                                                                                        875\n\f55.     Both Mrs. Nadler-Olenick and Mr. Williams were present and observed that official\n\nPoll/Tally tapes were not printed when the polls were closed at their respective polling locations.\n\nThey were both present and observed that Results/Tally tapes were not printed before the election\n\nmaterials     and     equipment      was     removed       from     their    respective     polling     locations.\n\nThey were both prevented from signing the official Results/Tally tapes because the election\n\nofficials at Randalls were instructed to not print the Results/Tally tapes 37 and they, intum, did not\n\nprint them. 38 See affidavit of official poll watcher, Paul Williams, Exhibit U. 39\n\n56.     The Travis County officers violations materially affected the outcome of the election\n\nbecause there is no way to verify the voting equipment and vote results (MBB, eSlate, and JBC)\n\nwere s not corrupted or modified after leaving the polling location. We know for a fact from\n\nmultiple Travis County election officer affidavits that many security seals on the election\n\nequipment were improperly sealed, seals were removed, and resealed because of security issues. 40\n\nTwo additional Pressley Official Poll Watchers were denied access to view election activities at\n\nthe Dobie Middle School election substation and the Travis County Central Counting facility on\n\nElection Day after the polls closed.\n\n57.     Sergio Martinez and Claire Martinez were also Official Campaign Poll Watchers for\n\nContestant. Sergio and Claire Martinez were initially denied access to Dobie Middle School,\n\nSubstation on December 16, 2014 and were not able to monitor and track the first set of election\n\nmaterials being transferred from the countywide polling location at Gus Garcia Recreation Center\n\n\n37\n   Exhibit C, JBC Report Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations. On the cover of the\nJBC Report Envelope, instructions to election officers clearly state, \"DO NOT PRINT THE TALLY.\"\n38\n   Exhibit C, JBC Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.\n39\n   Exhibit U, Affidavit of Official Poll Watcher, Paul Williams.\n40\n   Exhibit E, Affidavits from Runoff election officers documenting security seals are improperly sealed, removed and\nresealed.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.l7\n                                                                                                                         876\n\fto the Dobie Substation. This was one of the strongest Pressley precincts and voting locations in\n\nDistrict 4 and they intended to track the MBB chain of custody and transfer procedures.\n\n58.       Election materials entered and left the Dobie Substation and Mr. and Mrs. Martinez were\n\nnot able to monitor the chain of custody and transfer status of election materials (MBB's, etc.)\n\nfrom the various polling locations. This affected the outcome of the Runoff election in that errors\n\nin tabulating votes and maintaining security protocols occurred at Central Counting.\n\n59.       Also, Sergio and Claire Martinez were subsequently denied access in monitoring the\n\ntransfer of election materials (including but not limited to Mobile Ballot Boxes, sealed JBC and\n\neSlate computers, official envelopes with materials, and the like) and were prevented from\n\nmonitoring the tabulation activities occurring at Central Counting on Election night on December\n\n16, 2014.\n\n60.       On Election night, Contestant made numerous personal phone calls to the Travis County\n\nDirector of Elections, Michael Winn, informing him of that Mr. and Mrs. Martinez were\n\nrepeatedly being denied direct access to election and tabulation activities at Central Counting and\n\nMr. Winn did not correct the situation after multiple conversations.\n\n61.       Obstructing an official poll watcher is a Class A misdemeanor in the Texas Election Code\n\n33.061:\n\n          Sec. 33.061. UNLAWFULLY OBSTRUCTING WATCHER. (a) A person commits an\n          offense if the person serves in an official capacity at a location at which the presence of\n          watchers is authorized and knowingly prevents a watcher from observing an activity the\n          watcher is entitled to observe. (b) An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor.\n          Acts 1985, 69th Leg., ch. 211, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1986.\n\n62.       Multiple \"activities the watcher is entitled to observe\" were violate by Travis County\n\nelection officers as it relates to Pressley's official watchers:\n\n             a. Pressley poll watchers Paul Williams and Rae Nadler-Olenick were prevented from\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.l8\n                                                                                                        877\n\f               observing the printing and signing of Result tapes at the respective polling locations\n\n               they were serving on Election Day, and\n\n           b. Pressley poll watchers Sergio and Claire Martinez were prevented from accessing\n\n               and observing election materials transfer at Dobie Middle School and election\n\n               material transfer/election tabulation activities at Central Counting, respectively, on\n\n               Election Day.\n\n\n63.    Multiple election irregularities occurred at Central Counting on Election Day and\n\nPressley's poll watchers were denied access to monitor and report the issues. These election\n\nirregularities are the most concerning and egregious out of all the irregularities which occurred\n\nduring the Runoff election. These are very serious Class A misdemeanors, criminal violations, of\n\nthe Texas Election Code 33.061 and Contestant has documented violations of four separate counts.\n\n64.    These violations materially affected the outcome of the election in that an inordinate\n\nnumber of election irregularities occurred and there was a lack of accountability of election\n\nofficers with regard to no printing of Zero Tapes, no printing of Results Tapes, denying office poll\n\nwatchers access to election activities, improperly sealed electronic devices, security breaches of\n\nthe Tally vote tabulation system, corrupt Mobile Ballot Box entries, and Tally Audit log deletions.\n\nThe intent of the poll watchers is to ensure accountability, transparency, and secure practices are\n\nadhered to.      Because of the erroneous reported election results, the egregious election\n\nirregularities, and the missing election records, the outcome of the Runoff cannot be known.\n\n5.Audit Logs at Central Counting Show Missing Logs, Security Issues and Corrupt Files Loaded\n\n65.    Hart Voting System Audit Logs show multiple problems\n\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.l9\n                                                                                                        878\n\f               a. Tally Audit log and Ballot Now entries missing (Exhibit B, V, 41 W42 )\n\n               b. Security issues (Exhibit B, E)\n\n               c. MBB processing errors during vote tabulations at Central Counting on Election\n\n                   Day, December 16,2014, and (Exhibit B)\n\n               d. questionable entries into the Tally and security systems after Contestant filed her\n\n                   Election Contest, etc. (Exhibit B).\n\n66.        Numerous software/hardware errors occurred when Travis County electronically\n\ntransferred and tabulated the electronic Cast Vote Records.          There are nine \"Invalid/Corrupt\n\nMBB\" errors recorded in the Tally Audit logs during Election Day tabulations of votes. These are\n\nerrors associated with tabulating the electronic votes from the Mobile Ballot Boxes (Exhibit B\n\npages 5, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29 and 42). According to the Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir, the\n\nTally Audit logs are legally required and she describes the information the logs contain:\n\n           \"In general, they're going to track every single step, everything that's happening at the\n\n           counting station on election night.·· So every time something's turned on, every time\n\n           something's turned off, every time an entry happens.\" (Exhibit D, DeBeauvoir's Deposition,\n\n           p. 72 ,19-23)\n\n67.         The audit logs in the Tally (Exhibit B) and Ballot Now subsystems (Exhibit V and W)\n\nshow long periods of apparent inactivity between an administrator's last recorded action and a\n\nsession logout. They range from two hours to days long (see summary table, below).\n\n\n\n\n41\n     Exhibit V, Security audit logs for BN PC5system\n42\n     Exhibit V, Security audit logs for BN PC3 system\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.20\n                                                                                                        879\n\f                                                  Time System     Time Frame System Was Open and\n      Date of logOut   Travis County audit logs\n                                                   Was Open                 Vulnerable\n        12/1/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)         10 days                 Early Voting\n        12/2/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC5)          7 days                 Early Voting\n       12/10/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          9 days                 Early Voting\n       12/11/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          1 day                  Early Voting\n       12/12/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)           1day                  Early Voting\n       12/15/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          3 days                 Early Voting\n       12/16/2014               Tally             2 hrs, 44 min       Election Day Tabulations\n       12/16/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          1 day            Election Day Tabulations\n       12/18/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC5)          8 days           Election Day Tabulations\n        1/6/2015                Tally               4 hours                   Recount\n\n\n\n68.         During these extended logon times, anyone with physical access to the computer could\n\nuse the administrator account to arbitrarily change vote information in the database then directly\n\nedit the log files to hide the fact (ExhibitS, Dr. Jacobson's affidavit). This would require no more\n\nskill than reading the Tally manual and using legal administrator commands. There are unusually\n\nlong periods of apparent inactivity during a crucially important logged-in Tally administration\n\nsession during Election Day when vote tabulations were underway from !2:30pm thru 3:24pm\n\n(Exhibit B).\n\n69.         When not in use, the Tally system should be logged off to protect the security of the vote\n\ntabulation database. Having the system open is a critical security breach. The Tally system vote\n\ntabulation database was left open and security was compromised or there are activity files missing.\n\nEither way, the integrity of the electronic vote tabulation cannot be trusted.                   Thus, the outcome\n\ncannot be known to be true. Every vote counted electronically cast and counted (3,937) cannot be\n\nknown and exceed the margin of victory. The Court cannot determine the will of the votes and a\n\nnew election is required.\n\n70.         When asked about other extended time periods where the Tally administrator was logged\n\non and no activity was documented for roughly 7 days (Exhibit B) DeBeauvoir (Exhibit D,\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.21\n                                                                                                                     880\n\fdeposition) stated, \"I don't know what this means .. .I don't believe that's true .. .I doubt it's true .. .I\n\ndoubt it's true ... [the log is wrong?] yeah .. .I don't think that's true ... I don't know ... \" (Exhibit M,\n\nDana's Deposition p. 114, line 16 thru p. 117, p. 3).\n\n71.     In effect, the Travis County Clerk under oath when asked about the Tally Audit logs and\n\nthe issues, she stated, \"I don't think that's [Audit logs] true.\" Because the voting tabulation\n\nsystem was left open and security was compromised or there are log files missing, the integrity of\n\nthe vote tabulation cannot be trusted.          Thus, the outcome of the electronically tabulated votes\n\ncannot be known to be true.\n\n72.     Tally Audit Logs show multiple error codes being registered during the loading ofMBB's\n\nduring vote tabulations at Central Counting 43 .           With no Results/Tally Tape Reports from the\n\npolling locations (Exhibit C), there is no data to validate the results of the tabulation of the\n\nelectronically cast ballots and, thus, the results for the (3,937) electronically cast ballots for the\n\nDistrict 4 race and the outcome cannot be known.\n\n73.     In this election, the Tally Audit log produced by Travis County shows no less than nine (9)\n\ninstances of a corrupted Mobile Ballot Box being introduced into the Travis County election Tally\n\nsystem (Exhibit B). These documented, admitted nine (9) separate instances of corrupted data being\n\nintroduced into the election count system make it impossible to determine the true outcome of the\n\nelection. 44\n\n74.     This is an extraordinary level of corrupt mobile ballot boxes (MBBs), showing something\n\nwas wrong with the system that tallied the votes, according to the Travis County Clerk. From her\n\ndeposition (Exhibit D, page 98, lines 18-20; page 99 lines 4 -9):\n\n43\n  Exhibit B, Tally Audit Logs\n44\n  See ExhibitS, Declaration of expert witness Jeffrey Jacobson, Ph.D; See also Attachment B thereto, Audit Log\nproduced by Travis County; See also Exhibit D, Deposition of Dana DeBeauvoir, p. 87, 94, 96, 97, and 98, and Tally\nAudit Log, Exhibit 12 to Exhibit M (authenticated at page 55-56.)\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.22\n                                                                                                                     881\n\f       Q. [I]t's a little unusual to have so many\n       invalid MBBs in an election tally, isn't it?\n       A.· ·I've never heard of so many -\n\n       A. I suspect there's something wrong with the\n       reader, not the MBBs.\n       Q. (BY MR. COHEN) Okay. So you think-- your\n       suspicion is that there was something wrong with the\n       reader that night?\n       A. Correct.\n\n75.    There were more invalid/corrupt ballot boxes in a single election than Dana DeBeauvoir had\n\never heard of. DeBeauvoir is a person of extraordinary experience and knowledge in elections. She\n\nhas been Travis County Clerk for 28 years, overseeing elections in all that time, including every\n\nelection since 2002 using the Hart eSlate system. And she has NEVER HEARD OF as many invalid\n\nMBBs in an election tally as there were in this election. The Travis County Clerk herself conceded\n\nthat something was very wrong with the system tallying the votes -- that there was a degree of error\n\nin that election beyond anything she had ever heard of happening before.\n\n76.     And, according to her deposition testimony (Exhibit D), she has no idea why. From her\n\ndeposition, page 95, lines 6-10:\n\n       Q. · ·I haven't seen anywhere in this audit log what-- where it tells you what it did when it\n       found a corrupt MBB. .. Do you -- is that ...\n       A.· ·Yeah.· ·There would be other documentation that will tell you what happened.·· I can't\n       tell you.\n\n77.    From her deposition, page 96, lines 22-25:\n\n       ·Q.· ·(BY MR. COHEN)· ·Again, on page 23, if you go down by 8:42, there's another\n       \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB,\" and we still don't know what happened to that MBB.\n        A.· ·Same thing.\n\n78.    From her deposition, page 97, lines 1-8:\n\n       Q. · ·Okay.· ·And then there's another one a little further down, again.· ·And then there-- it\n       says \"MBB already read by Tally.\"· ·Do you see that?· ·There's three of those in a row.\n       A.· ·Uh-huh. · ·Uh-huh.\n       Q. · ·Do you have any idea what that-- what happened as a result of that?\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                    p.23\n                                                                                                        882\n\f           A.· ·I'm sorry.· ·I don't.\n\n According to expert, Dr. Jefferey Jacobson, Ph.D.(Exhibit S p. 1-2), \"Properly created MBB(s)\n\nmay have contained legitimate votes, but some event made it/them unreadable or corrupted ...\n\nAlternatively, a third party may 'Introduce corrupt MBBs into the legitimate flow ofMBBs from the\n\nprecincts back to Election Central' (California report, page 48, paragraph 1). 45 This could damage\n\nthe credibility of the vote counting process.\"\n\n79.        Corrupt MBBs, whether deliberately tampered with or accidentally introduced into the\n\nsystem, will either result in a failure to count actual votes, or in the counting of invalid votes, or in\n\nother corruption of the system.\n\n80.        In any event, nine (9) separate introductions of corrupted mobile ballot boxes into a system\n\ndesigned to tally votes is sufficient to undermine the reliability of the purported outcome.\n\n81.        The numerous irregularities (mathematical anomalies, failure to keep ballot images, failure to\n\nprint and keep Tally/Results tapes, numerous Invalid/Corrupt Mobile Ballot Box errors, Mobile\n\nBallot Box reader malfunction, deleted Tally Audit log data, and security breaches of the Tally\n\nsystem, shutting down polling locations) all render impossible a determination of the true outcome\n\nof the 3,93 7 electronically cast votes in the Runoff election.\n\n\n\n     6.Travis County Conducted Critical Recount Activities from January 4, 2015 through January 6,\n\n     2015 at 10:59am, before the Official Recount on January 6, 2015 at 11 :OOam.\n\n82.        The discussion of the problems and illegalities arising in the \"recount\" are relevant to the\n\n\n45\n  Exhibit A, Attachment 5, California Report: Inguva, S., Rescorla, E., Shacham, H., & Wallach, D.

This report is an official California government record, obtained through an\nofficial California government website, and is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under Texas Rule of\nEvidence 803(8) (c) (new number 803 (8)(A)(iii), effective Aprill, 2015.), and TRE 902 (5).\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                              p.24\n                                                                                                                        883\n\felection contest because the issues that appeared for the first time in the recount pointed to errors in\n\nthe conduct of the election. Specifically, the inability of Travis County to produce \"images of\n\nballots cast\" at the recount, in violation Texas Election Code§ 213.016led to the discovery that the\n\nmachines, as configured by Travis County for the December run-off election, violated Texas\n\nElection Code§ 128.001(a)(2). The discovery that Travis County, in operating the December run-\n\noff election, did not \"provide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main\n\ncomputer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection, ballot image storage, and result\n\ntabulation\" is conclusive evidence of illegality in the election.\n\n83.     One of the items the tribunal in an election contest is charges with determining is if \"the\n\noutcome of the contested election, as shown by the final canvass, is not the true outcome because: ...\n\nan election officer or other person officially involved in the administration of the election: ...\n\nengaged in other fraud or illegal conduct or made a mistake.\" TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 221.003.\n\n84.     Failing to print the legally required \"images of ballots cast\" for the election recount is a\n\nviolation of Texas Election Code§ 213.016 by itself. But it also led proximately to the discovery of\n\nadditional illegality.\n\n85.     Moreover, the discovery of those two illegalities undermine both the possibility of an\n\naccurate count or an accurate recount, as \"images of ballots cast\" are a prerequisite to a recount, and\n\nthe counting of actual ballots is the nature of a count.\n\n86.     The errors and illegalities at the \"recount\" also led to the discovery in the audit logs of\n\nmultiple corrupt mobile ballot boxes and other errors in the conduct of the election, some of which\n\nwere testified to by the County Clerk.\n\n87.     Unofficial recount activities were completed on January 4 - 6.           This was prior to the\n\nofficial Recount Start Notice (January 6, 2015 at 11:Oam) and as a result, Pressley and her official\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.25\n                                                                                                           884\n\fwatchers were not aware of and not allowed to monitor the unofficial recount activities that\n\noccurred prior.\n\n88.        On January 4 - January 5, 2015, prior to the start of the Official Recount on January 6,\n\n2015, Travis County Clerk and the Election Division officers conducted unofficial recount\n\nactivities in which they:\n\n               a.   gained access to the sealed and archived voting records for the District 4 Austin\n\n                    City Council Runoff Election on December 16, 2014, (Exhibit B)\n\n               b. Electronically extracted the District 4 voting records in the form of Cast Vote\n\n                    Records, (Exhibit B),\n\n               c. copied and compiled the official District 4, Cast Vote Records into a single pdf\n\n                    report, (Exhibit X) 46\n\n               d. printed roughly 4,000 Cast Vote Records for the District 4 race,\n\n               e. convened members of the Recount Committee whose roles were to recount votes\n\n                    (Exhibit Y) 47\n\n               f.   conducted unofficial Recount activities that lasted 4-6 hours 48 .\n\n89.        A Travis County employee, a member of the recount committee, who was present at the\n\nOfficial Recount on January 6th, relayed to one Pressley's recount watchers, on January 6, 2015,\n\n\"They started all this on Sunday [January 4, 2015].\"\n\n90.        Direct evidence of unofficial recount activities are shown in the Audit logs of Travis\n\nCounty's Hart Tally and SERVO systems (Exhibit B). These various audit logs document access,\n\nextraction, compilation, and printing of reports of the official District 4 Cast Vote Records and\n\n\n46\n     Exhibit X, Early Vote CVR in one file, used to print CVR, produced by Travis County\n47\n     Exhibit Y, Recount Invoice from Travis County\n48\n     Exhibit Y, Recount Invoice from Travis County\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.26\n                                                                                                        885\n\fdata on January 4th (2:18pm), January 5th (2:18pm), and January 6th (8:24am)-all prior to the start\n\ntime of the Official Recount on January 6, 2015 at 11 :OOam.\n\n91.    Contestant and her Official Vvatchers attended the Official Recount which started at 11:00\n\nam and individuals tasked with counting votes were dismissed around 4:30pm (roughly after 5.5\n\nhours). Additional evidence for unofficial recount activities are shown in the invoice (Exhibit Y)\n\nof the Recount charges which was provided to Contestant by Travis County after the Official\n\nRecount. The invoice documents Recount Committee members such as individuals who were\n\ntemporary employees and who counted votes. In many cases, individuals counting votes were\n\ndocumented as working over 9 hours performing vote recounting activities.\n\n92.    This Travis County Recount invoice documents Recount Committee members counting\n\nvotes, spent roughly twice the hours (Exhibit Y) required to complete the Official Recount and\n\nContestant's Official Watchers were not allowed to monitor those prior recount activities.\n\n93.    In addition, at the Official Recount, Contestant requested to view the source and properties\n\nof the CVR files, such as dates of the CVR files and origination, and was denied by the Recount\n\nCommittee Member, the Travis County Director of Elections, Michael Winn.\n\n94.    Obstructing an Official Watcher is a criminal offense and materially affected the outcome\n\nof the Recount.    Contestant and her Official Poll Watchers were denied access and were not\n\nallowed to monitor the critical recount activities such as vote retrieval and counting (Exhibit Y).\n\n95.    Most importantly, Contestant and her official Recount Watchers were not allowed to\n\nmonitor the integrity of where the Cast Vote Records were retrieved (Exhibit B), the source where\n\nthe retrieval occurred, or the copying of the Cast Vote Record files to an aggregated pdf file. The\n\nRecount pdf file obtained from Travis County during Production, is an electronic file and was\n\ncreated on January 6 approximately at 10:00 am was used to print, and was used to count votes in\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                   p.27\n                                                                                                      886\n\fthe Recount.\n\n96.       Denying Contestant her rightful access to monitor Recount activities and determine that\n\nillegal votes (in the form of duplicate copies of CVR's) were printed and counted, materially\n\naffected the outcome of the Recount. Counting copies of 3,937 CVR's do not meet the statutory\n\nrequirements for counting legal votes. The only legal votes produced at the Recount were the Mail\n\nin Ballots which were counted and tabulated to result in an exact tie of 240 votes for Pressley and\n\n240 votes for Casar (Exhibit A).\n\n7. Illegal Votes Counted-Statutory Ballots, Ballot Images and Images of Ballots Cast Were not\n\nRetained, Produced or Counted at Official Recount\n\n97.       On Tuesday, January 6, 2015, at 11:00 a.m. when the recount was to begin, the Travis\n\nCounty Clerk and the Recount Committee relayed to Contestant and her official recount watcher,\n\nKaren Renick that images of ballots cast on the Hart Electronic Voting System (eSlate) were not\n\navailable, would not be printed, and would not be recounted. 49\n\n98.       At that meeting, Dr. Pressley expressly stated, in her \"Petition Requesting a Recount,\" and\n\n\"Amended Petition Requesting a Recount\" that \"[w ]e are requesting a manual recount of the\n\nresults using the actual, stored, ballot images.\"     (See Appendix 11.) Pressley also expressly\n\nrequested \"a manual (by-hand) count.\" \"[T]he election code expressly provides for the 'printing\n\nof images of ballots cast using direct recording electronic voting machines for the purpose of a\n\nmanual recount.' See id. § 213.016.\" Andrade v. NAACP of Austin, 287 S.W.3d 240, 258 (Tex.\n\nApp. Austin 2009), rev'd on other grounds by Andrade v. NAACP of Austin, 345 S.W.3d 1 (Tex.\n\n2011).\n\n99.       Travis County's failure to print and count 3,937 images of ballots cast, for the District 4\n\n\n49\n     Exhibit Z, Affidavit of Karen Renick.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.28\n                                                                                                        887\n\fAustin City Council Election on December 16, 2014 on the Hart eSlate Electronic Voting System,\n\nviolates this provision of the election code and materially affected the outcome of the election\n\nbecause 3,937 illegal cast votes were counted.\n\n100.   Printing the CVR data files was in essence reprinting the previous electronically counted\n\nresults obtained on Election night. A CVR is a printing of a data file to a template. A template\n\nthat does not meet the statutory requirements for a \"ballot\" or an image of a \"ballot\" and as such it\n\nis not a meaningful check on the original count. 50\n\n101.   The recount failed to only count legal votes because \"images of ballots cast\" were not\n\n\n50\n   Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. Travis County's production of a \"cast vote\nrecord\" is a subset of the information on an Official Ballot. Therefore, an \"image of ballots cast,\" if\na true image, is an exact replica of a ballot cast. The 2014 Electronic Voting System Procedures\nbulletin, posted online at http://wVvw.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/clectronic-voting-system-\nprocedures.shtml, the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot images.\nSee, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8- Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEC § 214.071):\n1. The candidate requesting a recount may request that the recount be done electronically or\n        manually.\n2. For an electronic recount, the persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n        also authorized to be present as the election media are reloaded into the central accumulator\n        system.\n3. For a manual recount of a DRE election, the Recount Coordinator shall organize the printing of\n        cast vote records (ballot images) for the affected race or issue.\na.         The Recount Coordinator shall notify the parties in the recount of the date, place, and time\n                 the printing of cast vote records (ballot images) will take place.\nb.         The full recount committee is not required to be present at the printing of cast vote records\n                 (ballot images) and the Recount Chair shall determine how many members should be\n                 present. The persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n                 entitled to be present as the cast vote records (ballot images) are printed and to have\n                 the same number of representatives as allowed for the recount.\nc.         If the manual recount does not take place immediately after the printing of the cast vote\n                 records (ballot images), the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be locked\n                 and secured until the recount takes place.\nd.         A manual count of the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be conducted in the\n                 same manner as a recount of hand-counted paper ballots.\nAfter the recount is complete, the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be secured and\npreserved for the appropriate preservation period for maintaining election records.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                   p.29\n                                                                                                           888\n\fprovided and counted. Using the 3,937 CVR's instead of ballot image violates Texas Election\n\nCode 214.049 (e): \"If electronic voting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original\n\nballot, rather than the duplicate of the original ballot, shall be counted.\" Ballots are defined in\n\nTexas Election Code Chapter 52, Subchapter C. 5 1\n\nCast Vote Records are not legal Ballots, Ballot Images or Images of Ballots Cast\n\n102.   The most material fact in this lawsuit and is at a minimum hotly contested. Contestee relies\n\non post-hoc letters and instructions from agencies with a bureaucratic bias to argue that a cast vote\n\nrecord satisfies the statutory and constitutional requirements that an image of a ballot cast be kept to\n\nverify the computers tabulation of what the actual ballot the voter sees when the selecting a\n\ncandidate. Contestant relies on the factual difference between the ballot used and the cast vote\n\nrecord, expert testimony relying on reports and government statements and the statutes and laws of\n\nthe State of Texas to contend that a cast vote record does not comply with the law's requirement to\n\nmaintain images of the ballots cast. The resolution of this issue is very material to the decision in\n\nthis case because if a cast vote record is not a ballot or an image of a ballot there were no votes in\n\nthe election that can be counted other than the Absentee/Mail in Ballots.\n\n1. Definitions of \"Ballot Image\"\n\n51\n  For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that subchapter are Sec. 52.003 and Sec.\n52.070.\nSec. 52.003. PLACING CANDIDATE'S NAME ON BALLOT. (a) Except as otherwise provided\nby law, the authority responsible for having the official ballot prepared shall have placed on the\nballot the name of each candidate: ...\nSec. 52.070. VOTING SQUARE AND INSTRUCTION FOR CANDIDATES. (a) A square for\nvoting shall be printed to the left of each candidate's name on a ballot.\n(b) Immediately below \"OFFICIAL BALLOT,\" the following instruction shall be printed: \"Vote\nfor the candidate of your choice in each race by placing an 'X' in the square beside the candidate's\nname.\"\n\n(e) A square shall be printed to the left of each line provided for write-in voting under Section\n52.066(c), but failure to place a mark in the square does not affect the counting of a write-in vote.\n(emphasis added.)\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                    p.30\n                                                                                                           889\n\f103.    The Texas Secretary of State defines \"Ballot image\" without reference to a notion of \"Cast\n\nVote Records.\" 52 Per the Secretary of State's Glossary of Election Terminonolgy (Exhibit AA, p.\n\n2): \"Ballot Image: The ballot as it appears on a direct recording electronic (DRE) voting system. A\n\nballot image is self-evidently therefore not a Cast Vote Record.\n\n104.    The phrase \"Cast Vote Record\" does not appear in the Exhibit 0, Texas Secretary of State's\n\nGlossary of Election Terminology. !d.\n\n105.      The Federal government also defines \"Ballot image\" without reference to the notion of\n\n\"Cast Vote Record.\" In 1990, the Federal Election Commission's Performance and Testing Standard\n\nfor Punchcard, Marksense, and Direct Recording Electronic Voting Systems (DRE) 53 (Exhibit K, p.\n\n48, paragraph 1) reported:\n\n        To attain a measure of integrity over the process, DRE systems must also maintain\n        images of each ballot that is cast, such that records of individual ballots are\n        maintained by a subsystem independent and distinct from the main vote detection,\n        diagnostic, processing and reporting path.\n\n106.    Therefore, a Cast Vote Record (CVR) is not an image of\"each ballot that is cast.\"\n\n107.    To the extent the 1990 FEC report discusses what would later be known by others as \"Cast\n\nVote Records,\" the FEC distinguishes these data files from ballot images, saying there should be two\n\npathways for vote records in DRE's: a) images of ballots cast capability, and b) vote detection,\n\nprocessing and reporting path for vote data. The CVR is a reporting path/subsystem for reporting\n\nvoete results to the Tally system and a ballot image is an image file that is independent from a data\n\nreporting path (See Exhibit K). Therefore a Cast Vote Record is not an image file of a ballot.\n\n108.     In 2002, The Federal Elections Commission's 2002 Voting System's Standards, Volume 1,\n\n\n\n52\n   See Attached Exhibit AA, Texas Secretary of State's Glossary of Election Terminology,\nhttp://www. sos. state. tx. us/elections/laws/glossary. shtml.\n53\n   See Exhibit K the Federal Election Commission's 1990 Performance and Testing Standard for Punchcard, Marksense,\nand Direct Recording Electronic Voting Systems.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                            p.31\n                                                                                                                     890\n\fPerformance Standards 54 (Exhibit L) reinforced and upheld these 1990 requirements for DRE's to\n\nmaintain two pathways independent from each other so that vote data is stored and ballot images are\n\npreserved (p. 31-Section 2.2.4.2, p. 60-Section 3.2.lb(2), and page 135-Section 9.5.1.2.a).\n\nTherefore, a Cast Vote Record is not an image of a ballot.\n\n109.       In addition, Contestee never proves that the Cast Vote Record electronic file or paper copy\n\nproduced by Travis County is an image file, is a replica of anything a voter sees when they are\n\nvoting, or that it meets the legal standards of an Official ballot. The Cast Vote Record that Travis\n\nCounty has produced is not produced from an official ballot, is not produced from an image of an\n\nofficial ballot, or produced from anything a voter saw or experienced when casting their electronic\n\nvote. Therefore, a Cast Vote Record is not a ballot image.\n\n110.       Perhaps most decisively, the Hart Intercivic manuals themselves concede that a CVR is not\n\na ballot image. Hart's own Ballot Now Operations Manual documentation 55 provided to Travis\n\nCounty states that the eScan subsystem scans each paper ballot to create an exact digital image of\n\nthe ballot cast. The eScan creates and stores a ballot image (a bitmap, .bmp file) and then reads the\n\ndata to make a Cast Vote Record (Ballot Now manual, Exhibit AB, page 24 and 259-260). In this\n\nway, the Travis County's Hart manual clearly refers to the CVR (a data structure used to transfer\n\ndata for tabulation in Tally) and the ballot image (bitmap, .bmp file) as two technically different\n\nthings. Therfore, a Cast Vote Record is not an image of a ballot.\n\n                          1. A Cast Vote Record is not the same as a Ballot Image\n\n111.       Paragraph 22-29, above, decisively establish that the Texas Secretary of State, the Federal\n\nElection Commission and Hart InterCivic all define \"ballot image\" and \"Cast Vote Record\" as\n\n\n\n54\n     See Exhibit L Elections Commission's 2002 Voting System's Standards, Volume 1, Performance Standards.\n55\n     Exhibit AB, Ballot Now Manual produced by Travis County.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                            p.32\n                                                                                                             891\n\fdistinctly different. 56 This, at a minimum, creates a fact issue as to whether a Cast Vote Record is an\n\nimage ofballot cast that is required by law to preserved and counted in recount and contest.\n\n112.    Additionally, the following Texas statutes show that the Legislature intended the word\n\n\"ballot image\" to have a specific meaning that is different from the meaning asserted for \"Cast Vote\n\nRecord.\"\n\n113.    The Texas Election Code, Sec. 128.00l(a)(2), reqmres that \"The secretary of state shall\n\nprescribe procedures to allow for the use of a computerized voting system. The procedures must\n\nprovide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main computer to coordinate\n\nballot presentation, vote selection, ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\" The language of the\n        . man d atory. 57\nstatute 1s\n\n114.    Thus, the statute requires any Travis County electronic voting system have all of those four\n\ncomponents: a main computer to coordinate a) ballot presentation, b) vote selection, c) ballot image\n\nstorage, and 4) result tabulation.\n\n115.     Importantly, this section of the Code was enacted in 1997, before the word \"Cast Vote\n\nRecord\" appears in any Federal Election Commission and Texas Secretary of State records, and\n\nbefore such a term could have acquired any \"technical or particular meaning.\" The words must\n\ntherefore be construed as required under the Code Construction Act \"Sec. 311.011. COMMON\n\n56\n   Exhibit AC, additionally, Casar misrepresents the definitions of Cast Vote Record and ballot image in the 2007\nElection Assistance Commission Spanish-English Glossary of Key Election Terminology by omitting relevant pages in\nExhibit AC. Those relevant pages are attached, however in Exhibit 6 to Exhibit 24 of the Amended MSJ, and provide\nthe false notion that the EAC defines \"ballot image\" and \"Cast Vote Record\" as synonymous. The relevant pages are\nfound in Exhibit AC, p. 15, 16,and 19.\n57\n   Texas Government Code (Code Construction Act) governs the use of the word.\n\n         Sec. 311.016. \"MAY,\" \"SHALL,\" \"MUST,\" ETC. The following constructions apply unless the context in\nwhich the word or phrase appears necessarily requires a different construction or unless a different construction is\nexpressly provided by statute:\n                  ( 1) \"May\" creates discretionary authority or grants permission or a power.\n                  (2) \"Shall\" imposes a duty.\n                  (3) \"Must\" creates or recognizes a condition precedent.\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                             p.33\n                                                                                                                       892\n\fAND TECHNICAL USAGE OF WORDS. (a) Words and phrases shall be read in context and\n\nconstrued according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\" (emphasis added.)\n\nSee Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 1349, Sec. 50, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.\n\n116.     While Contestee mocks Pressley's use of the common usage of the word \"image\" as a\n\n\"picture,\" that is plainly the meaning contemplated by the Legislature in enacting the statute in 1997.\n\nA \"Cast Vote Record\" is nothing more than \"result tabulation\" referenced by the 1990 Federal\n\nElection Commission and contemplated by the 1997 statute. 58\n\n117.    This interpretation is subsequently supported by the 2002 Federal Election Commission\n\nreport (Exhibit L) and the Texas Secretary of State Glossary of Election Terms (Exhibit AA,\n\nhttp://www. sos. state. tx. us/elections/laws/ glossary. shtml, last visited March 15, 2015, 11 :36 a.m.)\n\ndefines as follows: \"Ballot Image: The ballot as it appears on a direct recording electronic (DRE)\n\nvoting system.\" No definition of \"Cast Vote Record\" appears in the Secretary of State's Glossary of\n\nElection Terms.\n\n118.    A genuine issue of material fact exists as to the central issue in this case: whether all four\n\ncomponents were provided in the conduct of the Runoff election in order to determine the victor in\n\nthe runoff. Plaintiffs assert the \"Cast Vote Record\" used in the Travis County Runoff election is not\n\nan \"image of a ballot cast.\" A side-by-side comparison of a Hart \"ballot image\" and \"cast vote\n\nrecord\" shows that the two are not the same.\n\n119.

Travis County admits that its system can only produce the easily-falsifiable Cast Vote\n\nRecords, not the more secure images of ballot cast required under the Texas Election Code\n\n(128.001a(2), 213.016).\n\n135.    During the recount, for the first time, it became apparent that Travis County had this illegal\n\ndefect in its procedures when Travis County only produced Cast Vote Records, and the election\n\nrecount supervisor stated that Travis County was incapable ofprinting images ofballots cast. 61\n\n136.    Because no ballot images were ever preserved, it is impossible for Travis County to produce\n\nand count the ballots, as required under the Tex. Constitution, Art. 6, Sec. 4, and Texas Election\n\nCode (213.016, 214.049(e)).\n\n13 7.   Because no ballot images were ever preserved, it is impossible for Travis County to conduct\n\na lawful recount the ballots, as required under the Texas Election Code (213.016, 214.049(e))\n\n138.    The ballot images must be preserved under the Texas Election Code. Failure to preserve\n\nballot images means that essential election records are missing.                  Such missing records make it\n\nimpossible for the tribunal to determine the outcome. In the event of such missing records, 62 an\n\norder to void the result and order a new election is appropriate. Garcia v. Avila, 597 S.W.2d 400,\n\n405 (Tex. Civ. App.-San Antonio 1980, writ dism'd).\n\n139.    Additionally, the evidence produced by Travis County shows that mistakes were made that\n\nmake it impossible for the tribunal to know the true outcome of the election.\n\n                                          Arguments and Authorities\n\n61\n   Attached Exhibit Z, Affidavit of Karen Renick, p.2\n62\n   DeBeauvoir confirmed that the election Tally system audit log is also missing data during Early Voting (Exhibit D,\nDeposition of Dana DeBeauvoir, p.76, line 7-15). In addition, DeBeauvoir confirmed that Travis County is also missing\nthe Results/Tally Tapes required by the Secretary of State. The SOS requires Results/Tally Tapes be printed when\nclosing the polls. When DeBeavoir was asked if the Runoff poll judges were told to not print Results/Tally tapes\ndirectly after the closing of the polls, her response was \"correct.\" (Exhibit M, Deposition of Dana DeBeauvoir, p. 128,\nline 15).\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                p.38\n                                                                                                                          897\n\f140.     \"The tribunal shall declare the election void if it cannot ascertain the true outcome of the\n\nelection.\" TEX.

The tribunal cannot ascertain the true outcome, because of\n\n                                                                           63\nevidence of mistakes and illegalities in the conduct of the election.\n\n141.     The largest and simplest illegality is plain. Travis County did not comply with the Texas\n\nElection Code requirement that, if it is to use a computerized voting system, it must use a system\n\n                             64\nwith ballot image storage.\n\nA CVR is not a \"Ballot Image.\"\n\n142.    As a matter of computer science, a CVR is not an \"image\" at all. Image files contain\n\ninformation not present in a CVR. The California report (Exhibit P, page 60, paragraph two) clearly\n\nstates that the CVR is a data structure. A data structure is a table or list of information, in this case,\n\na listing of the votes from one ballot. By contrast, an image file is a computer file which describes an\n\nimage as a grid of pixels, with color and other information for each pixel stored individually. A data\n\n                                                                                                           65\nstructure is not an image file, so the Cast Vote Record file is too small to be a ballot image file.\n\n143.    Image files are far larger than a Cast Vote Record .. \"A CVR is not ever more than 100 bytes\n\nlong (p 58, paragraph nine), which is more than enough room to hold a list of votes, at one byte per\n\nvote. But no image file format could do more than a dozen or so letters in 100 bytes; it certainly\n\n                                           66\ncould not hold an entire ballot image.\"         A CVR is nothing more than a simple data record. \"Hart's\n\nown documentation provided to Travis County states that the eScan subsystem scans each paper\n\nballot to create an exact digital image of the ballot cast.

In this way, the manuals clearly refer to\n\nthe CVR and the ballot image as two different things.\" 67 A CVR is not an image file.\n\n144.       Under Texas Statutes and constitution, a CVR is not a \"ballot image\" or \"image of\n\nballot cast.\"\n\n145.      A ballot image, as a matter of plain language, requires a \"Ballot\" and an \"image.\"\n\n146.      A ballot is defined through requirements set forth in the Texas Constitution and the Texas\n\nElection Code. It must possess:\n\n             a. a unique serial/ticket number (Texas Constitution, Article 6, Section 4 and Texas\n\n                  Election Code 52.062)\n\n             b. the election name (Texas Election Code 52.063), of Joint Special Runoff Election,\n\n                  Travis County\n\n             c. the election date (Texas Election Code 52.063), ofDecember 16, 2014,\n\n             d. the designation of Official Ballot (Texas Election Code 52.064)\n\n             e.   a voting square to the left of each candidate's name (Texas Election Code 52.070),\n\n                  and\n\n             f.   voting instructions (Texas Election Code 52.070, and 124.062)\n\n\n\n147.

The word \"image\" is defined at http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ as: Image noun\nim·age \\'i-mij\\\n: a picture that is produced by a camera, artist, mirror, etc.\n:a mental picture: the thought of how something looks or might look\n: the idea that people have about someone or something\nFull Definition of IMAGE\n1: a reproduction or imitation of the form of a person or thing; especially : an imitation in solid\nform : statue\n2 a: the optical counterpart of an object produced by an optical device (as a lens or mirror) or an\nelectronic device\nb : a visual representation of something: as (1) : a likeness of an object produced on a photographic\nmaterial (2) : a picture produced on an electronic display (as a television or computer screen)\n3 a : exact likeness : semblance <God created man in his own image- Genesis 1:27(Revised\nStandard Version)>\nb : a person strikingly like another person <she is the image of her mother>\n4 a : a tangible or visible representation : incarnation <the image of filial devotion>\nb archaic : an illusory form : apparition\n5 a (1): a mental picture or impression of something <had a negative body image ofherself> (2):\na mental conception held in common by members of a group and symbolic of a basic attitude and\norientation <a disorderly courtroom can seriously tarnish a community's image of justice -Herbert\nBrownell>\n\nb : idea, concept\n6: a vivid or graphic representation or description\n7: figure of speech\n8: a popular conception (as of a person, institution, or nation) projected especially through the mass\nmedia <promoting a corporate image of brotherly love and concern- R. C. Buck>\n9: a set of values given by a mathematical function (as a homomorphism) that corresponds to a\nparticular subset of the domain\n\n149.   Thus, an \"image\" of a ballot cast, as \"construed according to the rules of grammar and\n\ncommon usage,\" would require a \"picture\" or \"reproduction\" or \"optical counterpart\" or \"visual\n\nrepresentation\" or \"exact likeness\" or \"image\" file, in something similar to a photograph, a bitmap,\n\nJpeg, pdf, tif, etc. or similar computer format.\n\n150.   The Texas Election Code, Sec. 128.001(a)(2), requires that \"The secretary of state shall\n\nprescribe procedures to allow for the use of a computerized voting system. The procedures must\n\nprovide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main computer to coordinate\n\nballot presentation, vote selection, ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\"\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.41\n                                                                                                         900\n\f151.       A \"Cast Vote Record\" is nothing more than data storage file used for results tabulation. The\n\nTexas Government Code, Sec. 311.016(2) and (3) states:\n\n           \"MAY,\" \"SHALL,\" \"MUST,\" ETC. The following constructions apply unless the context in\n           which the word or phrase appears necessarily requires a different construction or unless a\n           different construction is expressly provided by statute:\n                   (2) \"Shall\" imposes a duty.\n                   (3) \"Must\" creates or recognizes a condition precedent.\n\n152.       Since Section 128.0001 ofthe Election Code states that the \"secretary of state shall prescribe\n\nprocedures [which] must provide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main\n\ncomputer to coordinate ... ballot image storage,\" the ballot image storage is a condition precedent\n\nto the legal use of any computerized voting system.\n\n153.        Travis County has failed to comply with this condition precedent to the legal conduct of an\n\nelection. While this would theoretically affect other races decided in December of 2014, the statute\n\nof limitations has passed for all election contests save this one.\n\n154.       The Hart Electronic Voting system can, according to its manuals, store ballot images and\n\ncast vote records. 69 The sky will not fall if this Court orders Travis County to conduct this election\n\nin conformance with Texas Election Code, using capabilities that are already part of the Hart\n\nIntercivic Ballot Now system (Exhibit A, Attachment 6). Contests of all other elections that have\n\nbeen held are barred by limitations. According to the Hart Manual it is a simple fix to have the\n\nsystem preserve images of the ballots the voters use in deciding which candidate to vote for and that\n\nconforms to the legal definition of a ballot.\n\n155.       Further, the Texas Government Code, Sec. 311.021, states in pertinent part:\n\n           Sec. 311.021. INTENTION IN ENACTMENT OF STATUTES. In enacting a statute, it is\n           presumed that:\n\n                   (1) compliance with the constitutions of this state and the United States is intended;\n\n69\n     Exhibit AB, Hart Ballot Now Operations Manual p. 24, 149, 259, 260\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                       p.42\n                                                                                                            901\n\f                   (2)   the entire statute is intended to be effective;\n                   (3)   a just and reasonable result is intended;\n                   (4)   a result feasible of execution is intended; and\n                   (5)   public interest is favored over any private interest.\n\n\n156.     Because the \"ballot image storage\" is listed separately as a requirement in two different parts\n\nof the statute, it is a just and reasonable to construe the entire statute as operating under that feasible\n\nrequirement that an actual \"ballot image,\" instead of a mere tally of the \"Cast Vote Records,\" be\n\nretained in the system in order to promote the public interest in transparent elections in which a\n\nhuman being can look at an image of a ballot and count by hand accordingly in a Recount, in a\n\nmanner closely analogous to the way that ballots have been counted in America for centuries.\n\n157.       The private interest of saving money by using a system on the cheap that does not fulfill the\n\npublic purpose of transparent elections is disfavored.                       The purpose of the Election Code is to\n\nprovide an accurate and transparent method of electing representatives to government offices in a\n\nway that is both efficient and conducive to public faith in the process. 70\n\n158.     In Alvarez v.

App.-San Antonio 1992, writ dism'd w.o.j.) (emphasis added). The court continued:\n\n         The public must have confidence that the election process is fair for all\n         candidates .... Those who have studied history and have observed the fragility of\n         democratic institutions in our own time realize that one of our country's most\n         precious possessions is the commitment of our public officials to the rule of law-fair\n         and evenhanded application of rules known in advance-and the widespread\n         acceptance of election results.\n\nId. at 249 (emphasis added).\n\n70\n  \"The purpose of the election code is to ensure that the true will of the voters is 'fairly expressed' and that the evidence of that\nexpression is 'properly preserved.'

The failures\nand mistakes illustrated in this Contest show that the will of voters was thwarted, and the evidence of that expression was\nnot properly preserved.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                           p.43\n                                                                                                                                        902\n\f159.   The United States Supreme Court has observed that:\n\n       [v ]oter fraud drives honest citizens out of the democratic process and breeds distrust\n       of our government. Voters who fear their legitimate votes will be outweighed by\n       fraudulent ones will feel disenfranchised. The right of suffrage can be denied by a\n       debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by\n       wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.\n\nPurcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 7 (2006) (per curiam) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n160.   By throwing out illegitimate votes of nonresidents, and enforcing the strict procedures for\n\nstorage of ballot images, use of only non-corrupt mobile ballot boxes and non-defective mobile\n\nballot box readers which protect against fraud and exploitation of voters, see Guerrero v. State, 820\n\nS.W.2d 378, 383 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 1991, pet. ref' d), this court will protect the franchise\n\nof all those District 4 voters who voted legitimately. The court should not hesitate, therefore, in\n\nordering a clean election.\n\n161.   Because \"ballot image storage\" was not used by Travis County, as the statute requires, the\n\nballot images from the runoff election are missing election records and there are no ballots that can\n\nbe counted other than the Absentee/Mail in Ballots which resulted in a tie. Therefore the only true\n\noutcome that can be ascertained is a tie which requires a new election.\n\n       \"Election records\" also include ballot boxes (containing voted ballots), tally sheets,\n       absentee ballots, applications for absentee ballots in person and by mail, signature\n       rosters for election day voting, and poll lists. Garcia v. Avila, 597 S.W.2d 400, 405\n       (Tex. Civ. App.-San Antonio 1980, writ dism'd). These items, and items like them,\n       also constitute \"precinct election records,\" as defined and used in chapter 66 of the\n       code. In addition, section 273.003 lists election returns, voted ballots, and the\n       signature roster as specific types of election records. TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. §\n       273.003 (Vernon 1986). Based on the uses of the term \"election records\" and the\n       examples listed within the code, we conclude \"election records\" are those which\n       memorialize the actual election and the actual conduct of the election.\n\nDallas Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Finlan, 27 S.W.3d 220, 228-229, 2000 Tex. App. LEXIS 5773, 13-14\n\n(Tex. App. Dallas 2000)\n\n162.     \"Ballot images\" are \"'election records' ... which memorialize the actual election and the\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                   p.44\n                                                                                                        903\n\factual conduct of the election.\"\n\n163.        Travis County has no ballot images.\n\n164.        Missing election records are, alone, sufficient grounds for this court to void the election.\n\nGarcia v. Avila, 597 S.W.2d 400, 403 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1980) (\"[B]ecause ofthe missing\n\nrecords it was impossible to ascertain the true results of the election. On that basis, the election was\n\ndeclared void and a special election was ordered.)\n\n165.        Similarly, in this case, because the election records are missing, this honorable Court must\n\nvoid the election and order a runoff election between the Contestant and Contestee on voting\n\nmachines that \"use ballot image storage\" as required by Texas Election Code 128.001 (a).\n\nContestee's amended motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n\nThe unserious \"argument\" that erroneous agency interpretation can retroactively affect\n\nstatutory history.\n\n166.        Contestee alleges, in what can only be described as a preposterous parody of statutory\n\nconstruction, that an ex post facto application of agency construction of language that flies in the\n\nface of plain meaning rule and which undermines the relevant federal standards and produces a\n\nresult that is both absurd and at odds with the statutory intent is to control.\n                                                                                      71\n167.        It is uncontested that the relevant Texas statutes were enacted in 1997        and 2003. 72 Those\n\nstatutes require \"ballot image storage.\" and \"images of ballots cast.\"\n\n168.        In his motion for traditional summary judgment, Contestee attempts to create ambiguity in\n\nthe reading of the statutes by asserting that various administrative agencies, years after the\n\nenactment of the statutes at issue, have redefined the words of the statutes in ways that are\n\ninconsistent with plain language and inconsistent with the meaning of the statutes as understood at\n\n71\n     Texas Election Code, Sec. 128.00l(a)(2)\n72\n     Texas Election Code, Sec. 213.016\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                         p.45\n                                                                                                                904\n\fthe time of their enactment.\n\n169.   This is, to put it generously, a badly mistaken view of statutory construction.\n\n170.   Administrative redefinition of statutes is not allowed.\n\n171.   Under Texas case law, as set forth in R.R. Comm 'n of Tex. v. Tex. Citizens for a Safe Future &\n\nClean Water, 336 S. W3d 619, 625 (Tex. 2011), the Texas Supreme Court reaffirmed it's 20-year-old\n\nrule that limited the deference due to administrative determinations to those that are \"'reasonable and\n\ndo[] not contradict the plain language of the statute.' First Am. Title Ins. Co., 258 S. W3d at 632\n\n(quoting Tarrant Appraisal Dist. v. Jl,foore, 845 S. W2d 820, 823 (Tex. 1993)).\"\n\n172.   The Safe Future Court added that \"this deference is tempered by several considerations:\"\n\n       It is true that courts give some deference to an agency regulation containing a reasonable\n       interpretation of an ambiguous statute. But there are several qualifiers in that statement.\n       First, it applies to formal opinions adopted after formal proceedings, not isolated\n       comments during a hearing or opinions [in a court brief]. Second, the language at issue\n       must be ambiguous; an agency's opinion cannot change plain language. Third, the\n       agency's construction must be reasonable; alternative unreasonable constructions do not\n       make a policy ambiguous.\n\n173.     The plain language ofthe statutes require an \"image\" of a \"ballot.\" A \"Cast Vote Record,\"\n\nas a mere data record is neither \"image\" nor \"ballot.\"\n\n174.     In Texas Dep 't of Protective and Regulatory Services v. Mega Child Care, 145 S.W.3d 170,\n\n177 (Tex. 2004), the Texas Supreme Court, in overruling a 25-year-long pattern of erroneous\n\ninterpretation of administrative law, made it clear that Texas embraces an unusually strong version\n\nof the plain meaning rule.\n\n       If the statutory text is unambiguous, a court must adopt the interpretation supported\n       by the statute's plain language unless that interpretation would lead to absurd results.\n       See Tune v. Tex. Dep't ofPub. Safety, 23 S.W.3d 358, 363 (Tex.2000) (\"We must\n       enforce the plain meaning of an unambiguous statute.\"); Republic Bank Dallas, N.A.\n       v.

Waples, 108\n        Tex. 167, 188 S.W. 1037, 1039 (1916) (The literal meaning of a statute may be\n        disregarded \"only where it is perfectly plain that the literal sense works an absurdity\n        or manifest injustice.\").\n\nSee also AIC Mgmt. v. Crews, 246 S.W.3d 640 (Willet, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted)\n(citing to Alex SheshunoffMgmt. Servs., L.P. v. Johnson, 209 S.W.3d 644,652 n.4 (Tex. 2006) and\n542 U.S. 241, 267, 124 S. Ct. 2466, 159 L. Ed. 2d 355 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in the\njudgment).\n\n175.    The language of 128.001(a)(2) and 213.016 is unambiguous. The application of the plain\n\nlanguage does not lead to absurd results. The plain language does not work an absurdity or manifest\n\ninjustice. Therefore, the Court must enforce the plain language requiring the storage and printing of\n\nimages ofballots cast.\n\n176.    Contestee argues that the plain meaning rule does not apply, because subsequent statements\n\nby administrative agencies contradict the plain meaning. In support of this notion, Contestee cites\n\nTexas Government Code 311.011 (b): \"Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or\n\nparticular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\"\n\n177.      First of all, it is obvious that there is no unanimous or consistent re-definition of a \"ballot\n\nimage\" as a \"Cast Vote Record\" at the federal level, or even within the Texas Secretary of State's\n\nOffice, or within the manuals of Hart InterCivic governing this very voting system. See supra,\n\nparagraphs 22-29.\n\n178.      Moreover, every suggestion of such a re-definition put forth by Contestee is dated AFTER\n\nthe statutes were enacted in 1997 and 2003. 73 It is impossible that documents published AFTER the\n\nstatutes were enacted were considered by the legislature, and intended to have effect in defining\n\n\n73\n   The Texas Secretary of State references cited are in 2012, 2014 and 2015. A single Election Assistance Commission\nreference, which is mischaracterized as described supra, is dated 2007. There is no evidence that the \"Words and\nphrases [] ha[ d] acquired a technical or particular meaning\" prior to statutory enactment.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.47\n                                                                                                                       906\n\fstatutes written years before they were published. 74 The suggestion, once clearly explained, 1s\n\nobviously ludicrous.\n\n179.     If that were not enough reason to disregard the notion put forward by Contestee, the Safe\n\nFuture deference \"applies [only] to formal opinions adopted after formal proceedings, not isolated\n\ncomments during a hearing or opinions [in a court brief].\" (second bracket set in original.)\n\n180.     Contestee has put forward no evidence of any \"formal opinions adopted after formal\n\nproceedings,\" and has explicitly attempted to rely on a 2008 \"isolated comments during a hearing or\n\nopinions [in a court brief].\" These random droppings are due no deference by this court ..\n\n181.     Contestee also rests its notion that the SOS may willy-nilly redefine the words in statutes on\n\nSection 52.075 of the Election Code. That section allows the SOS to \"prescribe the form and content of\n\na ballot for a ... electronic voting system .. to conform to the formatting requirements of the system.\"\n\nThe limiting language in the provision does not allow the SoS to redefine the statute. The limiting\n\nlanguage allows the SoS to change the form and content merely to the extent required to conform with\n\nfom1atting requirements of a computer system. This is unsurprising, necessary, and nowhere near as\n\nbroad a grant of power as Contestee imagines. This allows the SoS to choose, for instance, among\n\nvarious image file formats. But it does not allow the SoS to ignore the requirement of Texas Election\n\nCode, Sec. 128.00l(a)(2) for \"a main computer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection,\n\nballot image storage, and result tabulation.\"                    How the SoS mandates compliance with the\n\n128.001(a)(2) elements is discretionary under 52.075.                      If   they mandate compliance with the\n\n128.00l(a)(2) elements is not made discretionary by 52.075. Further, the more specific provisions\n\nof Election Code Chapter 124, SubChapter C Electronic Voting System Ballot, trump 52.075. (e.g.,\n\n\n74\n  Tex. Const., Art. 1, Sec. 16. states that \"No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing\nthe obligation of contracts, shall be made.\" There is no reason to believe that retroactive administrative rulings are in\nsome way exempt from this rule.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                      p.48\n                                                                                                                              907\n\fthe electronic system ballot must be a different color than the sample ballot, § 124.062; specific\n\ninstructions are required, §124.062.)\n\n182.   A ballot is defined through requirements set forth in the Texas Constitution and the Texas\n\nElection Code. It must possess:\n\n           a. a unique serial/ticket number (Texas Constitution, Article 6, Section 4 and Texas\n\n                Election Code 52.062)\n\n           b. the election name (Texas Election Code 52.063), of Joint Special Runoff Election,\n\n                Travis County\n\n           c. the election date (Texas Election Code 52.063), ofDecember 16, 2014,\n\n           d. the designation of Official Ballot (Texas Election Code 52.064)\n\n           e.   a voting square to the left of each candidate's name (Texas Election Code 52.070),\n\n                and\n\n           f.   voting instructions (Texas Election Code 52.070)\n\n183.   The cast vote records do not fulfill these requirements.\n\n184.   Consequently, the Court must reject any \"cast vote records\" counted, produced and tallied\n\non election night and the recount because they do not meet the statutory standards of an Official\n\nBallot and cannot be verified as representing the voter's intent in the District 4 Runoff race. This is\n\nespecially true when the election tally is pervasively tainted s described above.\n\n185.   In addition, the Texas Election Code is very clear that \"ballots,\" \"images of ballots cast,\"\n\nand \"ballot images\" are to be counted and used to verify voters' intent when the election results\n\nare challenged. It is well known, that an actual digital, electronic image file in the form of various\n\ntypes such as a bitmap, pdf, jpg, png, etc. is a different type of file compared to a CVR dataset file.\n\nThe legislature's specific language of \"ballot image\" provides a secondary method for verifying\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                    p.49\n                                                                                                          908\n\fballot counts. Simply printing out the same CVR data to a predefined CVR template, and counting\n\nthose CVR's which is what was already electronically counted, is not a verification method.\n\n8.Re-canvass Should have Occurred with Mail in Ballots\n\n186.     The District 4 Austin City Council Election made material errors and should have been re-\n\ncanvassed using the results of the recount of the Mail in Ballots (240 for Pressley and 240 for\n\nCasar) and the election should have been declared a tie between Contestant Pressley and Contestee\n\nCasar.\n\n187.     Travis County failed to follow statutorily required recount procedures and recounted the\n\n3,937 votes which were illegal on two counts. Primarily, the 3,937 votes were not counted from\n\n\"images ofballots cast.\" Secondarily, the 3,937 votes were not original Cast Vote Records-they\n\nwere copies of Cast Vote Records that were aggregated into a pdf file that was generated in\n\nJanuary 2015. Travis County made material errors because the 3,937 votes cast on the eSlate are\n\nillegal on both counts and the final canvassed result, which was derived from these illegal votes, is\n\nnot the true outcome of the election; the true outcome is a tie.\n\n\n                                        III. CAUSE OF ACTION\n\n188.     Contestant incorporates paragraphs 1 through 76 of this Petition herein\n\n189.     The runoff election for City Council of the City of Austin, Precinct 4 must be voided\n\npursuant to Section 221.012 of the Texas Election Code and a new election held as described below\n\nbecause the true outcome cannot be ascertained or, in the alternative the only ballots cast in the\n\nelection meeting legal requirements of a ballot resulted in a tie.\n\n190.     The result of these multiple irregularities, mistakes and possibility of fraud is that the\n\nresult cannot be ascertained. The Court may request voters to disclose how they voted. Or, the\n\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.50\n                                                                                                        909\n\fCourt may declare the election void without attempting to determine how voters voted (Texas\n\nElection Code 221.009) and call for a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such an election be\n\ntimely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Constitution and the Texas Election Code.\n\n191.     In Texas Constitution, Article 6, Section 4, \"In all elections by the people, the vote shall be\n\nby ballot...\" The Texas Election Code 52.001, also stipulates, \"the vote in an election is by\n\nofficial ballot. .. \" Ballots are defined in Texas Election Code Chapter 52, Subchapter C. 75\n\n192.     In addition, the Texas Election Code (xxx) is very clear that \"ballots,\" \"images of ballots\n\ncast,\" and \"ballot images\" are to be counted and used to verify voters' intent when the election\n\nresults are challenged. It is well known, that an actual digital, electronic image file in the form of\n\nvarious types such as a bitmap, pdf, jpg, png, etc. is a different type of file compared to a CVR\n\ndataset file. The legislature's specific language of\"ballot image\" provides a secondary method for\n\nverifying ballot counts. Simply printing out the same CVR data to a predefined CVR template,\n\nand counting those CVR's which is what was already electronically counted, is not a verification\n\nmethod.\n\n193.         Several election safeguards and procedures defined by the Legislature and the Secretary\n\nof State that are intended to prevent human errors were mistakenly not followed by Travis County.\n\nThe mistakes and failure to adhere to the Secretary of State's procedures led to and caused errors,\n\nand illegal votes to be counted, legal votes to be not counted, and the election outcome cannot be\n\n75\n   For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that subchapter are Sec. 52.003 and Sec. 52.070.\nSec. 52.003.

The sum total of all voting irregularities identified herein exceeds the number of votes by\n\nwhich the election was decided.\n\n195.     If no \"images of ballots cast\" can be retrieved, printed and counted, the true outcome of the\n\nelection cannot be ascertained. The Court may order each of the more than 4,000 voters who\n\nvoted in person to testify as to how they voted, pursuant to Texas Election Code\n\nSec. 221.010. \"SECONDARY                 EVIDENCE           FOR      UNAVAILABLE              BALLOTS.            If an\n\nexamination of ballots is needed in an election contest and the ballots are lost, destroyed, or\n\notherwise beyond the reach of the tribunal, the voters who cast the ballots may testify as to how\n\nthey voted.\"\n\n196.     In the alternative, if Travis County cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\" to be printed\n\nand counted, then Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and\n\nthe election is void. If the court does not count cast vote records because they are not images of\n\nanything defined by law as a ballot then it can ascertain the election to be a tie by counting the\n\nAbsentee/mail-In ballots either way as a matter of law, the Court must therefore order a new\n\nelection.

On Tuesday, December 301h, the Mayor and City Council of Austin conducted an official\n\ncanvass and certification of the Runoff results for all races on the December 16, 2014 ballot,\n\nincluding District 4. However a recount was conducted on January 6, 2015 and those results did\n\nnot change.

INTRODUCTION\n\n1. Contestant moves this honorable Court to compel the Clerk of Travis County, Texas to\n\nprovide documents responsive to her requests for production. While there is some overlap,\n\nbasically, the Travis County Clerk has either failed to provide such responsive documents, made\n\nerroneous objections, or asserted privileges which do not comply with Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 193.\n\n2. Procedurally, Travis County has not provided evidence to support the privileges they assert\n\nas required by TRCP 193.4. Rule 193.4(a) requires that \"The party making the objection or\n\nclaim of privilege must present any evidence necessary to support the objection or privilege.\"\n\nThe privilege log provides no such evidence of the basis for the privileges asserted.     Mere\n\nassertions are not enough to preclude Travis County from providing the documents requested.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Motion to Compel                                                  p.l\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  4501\n\f3. Further, there are documents missing from the production requested that Travis County has\n\nasserted neither objection nor privilege. The responses are either unclear or incomplete. Since\n\nthere are no timely objections or assertions of privilege as to the unclear or incomplete responses,\n\nthe Travis County Clerk must provide the requested documents.\n\n4. Based on the pleadings, dispositive motions, and expert 1 impressions on file with this Court,\n\nthe documents sought by this motion to compel discovery responses are essential to Contestant's\n\ncase for a new election. Contestant's response to Contestee's motions for summary judgment\n\ndemonstrates potential corruption of the election process.      Contestant's expert describes the\n\nnecessity and materiality of the documents requested. The documents sought delve into the\n\ndetails of Travis County's process of conducting the December 2014 Runoff Election for City\n\nCouncil District 4 using electronirc voting machines and the proof that not only that the process\n\nitself was full of irregularities that materially affected the outcome, but that the process used by\n\nTravis County does not produce an \"image of a ballot cast\" as required by the Texas Election\n\nCode.\n\n5. Contestant moves the Court issue an order to compel Travis County to produce the\n\ndocuments for which it claimed privilege as well as documents that are missing or clarification\n\nof the response.\n\n6. Finally, should Travis County fail to comply with the Court's order, Contestant requests that\n\nthe Court award attorney's fees and costs associated with this motion\n\n\n\n\n1\n Exhibit F, Expert's Mental Impressions and Exhibit G, Expert's Declaration in Lieu of\nAffidavit.\n\nPressley v. Casar Motion to Compel                                                       p.2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       4502\n\f                  II. STANDARD TO COMPEL IN ELELCTION CONTEST\n\n7. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.1 states that \"When responding to written discovery, a\n\nparty must make a complete response, based on all information reasonably available to the\n\nresponding party or its attorney at the time the response is made.\" See In re Allied Chern. Corp.,\n\n227 S.W.3d 652, 657 n.20 (Tex. 2007)(\"a party must make a complete response, based on all\n\ninformation reasonably available to the responding party or its attorney at the time the response is\n\nmade.\") Providing incomplete responses violates the Texas rules for discovery.\n\n8. To the extent privilege is asserted based on an agreement with one of the parties, the\n\nagreement itself cannot form the basis of a privilege when portions of the information therein are\n\ndiscoverable. Fleming v. Ahumada, 193 S.W.3d 704, 716 (Tex.App. - Corpus Christi 2006)\n\n(citing Scott v. Mc!lhany, 798 S. W2d 556, 559-60, 34 Tex. Sup. Ct. J 64 (Tex. 1990) (discussing\n\ninability of litigants to use private agreements to block discovery of information and testimony\n\nsought by third parties); In re Cont'l Ins., 994 S. W2d 423, 426 (Tex. App.-Waco 1999, orig.\n\nproceeding) mand. granted      In re Union Pac. Res. Co., 22 S. W3d 338, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J 145\n\n(Tex. 1999) (discussing limitations on contractual provisions to require litigant to \"raise frivolous\n\nobjections or grounds for refusing to produce discoverable information\"). See also In re DCP\n\nMidstream, L.P., 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 11092 (Tex.App.- Corpus Christi 2014) (\"the fact that\n\na settlement agreement contains a confidentiality provision does not render the agreement or its\n\ncontents undiscoverable as a matter of law ... Accordingly, the confidentiality provisions of the\n\nagreement do not insulate the settlement agreement from discovery if the discovery is otherwise\n\nwarranted.\")\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Motion to Compel                                                       p.3\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        4503\n\f9. Refusal to provide these documents and access to the election software and hardware used\n\ncould deprive Contestant of evidence at trial relating to the actual malfunction of the electronic\n\nvoting system actually used.\n\n                                            III. FACTS\n\n\n10. On March 19, 2015, Contestant served her First Requests for Production to Travis County,\n\nTexas County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir, and she responded. See attached Exhibit A for the initial\n\nRequest for Production, Exhibit B for Court's Order, Exhibit C for Privledge Log, Exhibit D for\n\nEmail responses regarding repeated requests for Production The Travis County Clerk failed to\n\nprovide documents in response to the following specific requests that were originally granted by\n\nCourt (Exhibit E).\n\n11. On April 13, 2015, the Court held that the Clerk was not required to produce access to\n\nproprietary information or inspection of direct electronic voting machines, eSlate voting system,\n\nJudge's booth controllers, software or hardware used in conjunction with eState system directly\n\nto Pressley. In attempted compliance with the order, the Clerk withheld that information from\n\nproduction and the equipment from inspection.\n\n12. The Clerk provided the privilege log attached hereto as Exhibit C listing what it did not\n\nproduce and why.\n\n13. Of course, the documents and items the Court allowed the Clerk to withhold from direct\n\nunprotected production and inspection are not privileged except to the extent they constitute\n\ntrade secrets.   The Texas Supreme Court in In re Bass, 113 S. W3d 735 (Tex. 2003) set forth the\n\nstandard by which information may be considered a trade secret entitled to privilege:\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Motion to Compel                                                      p.4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4504\n\fWe have held that a trade secret is \"any formula, pattern, device or compilation of\ninformation which is used in one's business and presents an opportunity to obtain an\nadvantage over competitors who do not know or use it ... To determine whether a trade\nsecret exists, this Court applies the Restatement of Torts' six- factor test:\n\n       (1) the extent to which the information is known outside of his business; (2) the\n       extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in his business; (3) the\n       extent of the measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the\n       value of the information to him and to his competitors; (5) the amount of effort or\n       money expended by him in developing the information; (6) the ease or difficulty with\n       which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others ...\n\n14. There is no privilege for evidence termed \"proprietary.\" Indeed, everything is proprietary to\n\nsomebody. The Court in In re Continental General Tire, 979 SW2d 609, 615 (Tex. 1998) held:\n\n       Trade secrets and confidential information are not necessarily ''privileged' matters\n       within the meaning of Rule 186a. If the information is material and necessary to the\n       litigation and unavailable from any other source, a witness may be required to make\n       disclosure.\n\n15. Some of the withheld information is not trade secrets and should be produced and their\n\ninspection does not violate a protectable trade secret.       Midstream, id. (the confidentiality\n\nprovisions of the agreement do not insulate the settlement agreement from discovery if the discovery\n\nis otherwise warranted.)\n\n16. To the extent such information and items for inspection may constitute trade secrets, they\n\nstill contain information relevant to the issues in this case. The proper procedure is for such\n\nitems to be tendered to the Court in camera for its determination if they are indeed trade secrets\n\nand with respect to trade secrets if they contain relevant information. If they contain relevant\n\ninformation, they should still be ordered disclosed subject to a protective order designed to\n\nprotect their secrecy consistent with their need for use in this proceeding.

Contestee's motion to strike and for sanctions must be denied. First, Contestee asks the\n\nCourt to strike Contestant's pleading based on lack of attachment of the lists referenced in the\n\npleading. Contestant made a good faith effort to amend her contest; the attachments were not, it\n\nturns out, accepted by the Court's electronic filing system, leaving the attachments off the filing.\n\nCounsel and Contestant were not aware that the electronic filing system had rejected the\n\nattachment to the 5th Amended Contest.\n\n2.     Second, a simple phone call or email from opposing counsel would have resulted in\n\nContestant's counsel emailing the attachments to them. As Contestant will show below, she has\n\ndone so. Constestee's counsel currently has in their possession the attachments Contestee asserts\n\nwere lacking, the basis of his motion to strike and sanctions.       Because Contestee has these\n\ndocuments in his possession, his claims that Contestant's assertions are groundless, are\n\nthemselves groundless.\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                       p.l\n                                                                                                       1525\n\f3.      Third, through discovery, Contestant has learned from Travis County's Audit Log for the\n\n2014 Runoff election that there were nine (9) mobile ballot boxes (MBB) from the Runoff\n\nelection were that were reported as corrupted. In addition to the fact the Contestee has the\n\ndocuments they claimed they lacked, the evidence that nine MBB' s were corrupted belies\n\nContestee's groundless claim.     Finally, the issues raised in Contestee's motion to strike are\n\naddressed, and therefore mooted, by Contestant's 6th Amended Petition. Contestee's motion\n\nmust be denied on the grounds set forth.\n\n\n\n     Error by Court Electronic Filing System in attaching the lists referenced in the pleading\n\n4.      Contestee complains that attachments referenced in the amended contest were missing\n\nfrom the filing.   Contestant made a good faith effort to cure the defects of her previous contest\n\nbased on the Court's order on special exception. Contestant attached the exhibits reference in\n\nContestee's Motion to Strike to the filing of her 5th Amended Contest. The Court's electronic\n\nfiling system did not accept the attachments as part of the system. See Exhibit A, Declaration of\n\nDavid Rogers with Attachment 1, E-FILETEXAS.GOV Email notice of Submission Failure\n\n4962344 included herein by reference as if fully set forth.\n\n5.      Neither Contestant nor her counsel were aware of the failure of the system to accept the\n\nexhibit attachments until Contestee's counsel filed this motion. Had counsel conferred with\n\nContestant's counsel regarding the missing exhibits, Contestant's counsel would have\n\nimmediately provided same. Contestant, through counsel, emailed the rejected attachments to\n\ncounsel for Contestee. See Exhibit B, Declaration of Charlotte Secord with Attachment 2, Email\n\nof 5th Amended Contest attachments to Contestee's counsel included herein by reference as if\n\nfully set forth.\n\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                        p.2\n                                                                                                       1526\n\f6.     The Court cannot strike the pleadings of a party that makes a good faith effort to cure\n\ndefects in their pleading. Humphreys v. Meadows, 938 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex.App. - Ft. Worth\n\n1996, writ denied). Instead, Contestee must file new special exceptions, the Court must sustain\n\nthem, and Contestant must be given another opportunity to amend before the Court may strike\n\nher pleadings. Baca v. Sanchez, 172 S.W.3d93, 95-96 (Tex.App. - El Paso 2005, no pet).\n\n\n\nNo Basis of Groundlessness\n\n7.     The court in Dike v. Peltier Chevrolet, Inc. 343 S.W. 3d 179 (Tex.App. - Texarkana\n\n2011) held:\n\n       [T]o award sanctions under Chapter 10, it must be shown that: (1) the pleading or\n       motion was brought for an improper purpose; (2) there were no grounds for the\n       legal arguments advanced; or (3) the factual allegations or denials lacked\n       evidentiary support. Chapter 10 specifies that one of the aims for imposition of\n       sanctions for the filing of frivolous or groundless pleadings is to \"deter repetition\n       of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.\"). (Citations\n       omitted)\n\n\n8.     More importantly, the court in Peltier expounded on the standard for the award of\n\nattorney's fees for sanctions:\n\n       In determining whether sanctions are appropriate, the trial court must examine the\n       facts available to the litigant and the circumstances existing when the litigant filed the\n       pleading Courts should presume parties and their counsel file all papers in good faith,\n       and the party seeking sanctions must overcome that presumption. The party seeking\n       sanctions has the burden of showing its right to relief. (Citations omitted.)\n\nSee also Nath v. Tex. Children's Hasp., 446 S.W.3d 355, 361 (Tex. 2014) (\"Generally, courts\n\npresume pleadings and other papers are filed in good faith The party seeking sanctions bears the\n\nburden of overcoming this presumption of good faith.\"); Zeijinan v. Michels, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS\n\n10523 (Tex.App. - Austin 2013).\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                           p.3\n                                                                                                          1527\n\f9.      Even in a case such as this, where the sanction is sought pursuant to CPRC 10.01 et. seq.,\n\nthe burden is on the party seeking sanctions to prove that the pleading is groundless, i.e., that the\n\nfact alleged could not be proved factually or there is no legal basis. In Peltier, 343 S.W. 3d\n\n179, 184, the court held:\n\n        Under Section 10.001, the signer of a pleading certifies that each claim and allegation\n        is based on the signatory's best knowledge, information, and belief, formed after\n        reasonable inquiry. Each allegation and factual contention in a pleading must have, or\n        be likely to have, evidentiary support after a reasonable investigation. (Citation\n        omitted)\n\nSee also Low v. Henry, 221 S. W3d 609,614 (Tex. 2007).\n\n\n10.     In this case, the sole basis for Contestee's motion is that Contestant allegedly failed to attach\n\nthe documents referred to in the Sth Amended Contest. As shown above, not only was the lack of\n\nattachments simply an electronic clerical error, Contestant has provided Contestee's counsel with the\n\ndocuments supporting Contestant's claims in her Sth Amended Contest (with a copy to the Court)\n\nrejected by the Court's e-filing system.\n\n11.     Counsel for Contestee could have swiftly and easily remedied the confusion by a phone call\n\nor email to counsel for Contestant for the attachments referenced in Contestant's Sth Amended\n\nContest. Instead, Contestee's counsel has chosen to exercise the resources of this Court to basically\n\naccomplish the same result.\n\n\nGroundlessness Belied by Corrupted Mobile Ballot Boxes\n\n\n12.     On May 11, 201S, counsel for Contestant deposed the Travis County, Texas County Clerk,\n\nDana DeBeauvoir regarding, among other things, the electronic voting system used in the 2014\n\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                           p.4\n                                                                                                            1528\n\fTravis County Runoff election. Among the exhibits about which she was deposed was the Official\n\nAudit Log for the December 16, 2014 Joint Special Runoff Election. See attached Exhibit C.\n\n13.     Therein, Contestant discovered entries for MBB's identified as corrupted. Below is a chart\n\nthat references the page numbers on which the corrupted MBB' s are listed:\n\n        Page                       Date                       Time                  Description\n\n5                       12/16/14                   12:30:00 pm               Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n22                      12/16/14                   8:34:45 pm                Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n23                      12/16/14                   8:42:16                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n23                      12/16/14                   8:42:43                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n26                      12/16/14                   8:53:36                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n27                      12/16/14                   8:57:04                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n27                      12/16/14                   8:57:04                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n29                      12/16/14                   9:09:34                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n42                      12/16/14                   10:12:44                  Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n\n\n14.     These nine entries on Travis County's 2014 Runoff election audit log clearly indicate that the\n\nmobile ballot boxes were either invalid or corrupted. The corrupt MBBs contained Runoff election\n\nvotes which mayor may not have been properly included in the Runoff election count and recount.\n\nRegardless, Contestants allegation and factual contention that corruption of votes in the corrupted\n\nTravis County electronic voting system in her contest has, or is likely to have, evidentiary support\n\nafter a reasonable investigation.

Because there is no basis for a groundless\n\npleading claim, Contestee's motion to strike and sanctions must be denied.\n\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                          p.5\n                                                                                                          1529\n\fContestee's motion to strike addressed and mooted by Contestant's 6th Amended Petition\n\n15.    The offending references to specific voters has been removed by the Contestant's filing\n\nof her 6th Amended Contest. Because the challenged portions of Contestant's prior pleadings no\n\nlonger exist in the live Contest, Contestee's motion to strike is moot. As the court in Houston\n\nChronicle Publ'g Co. v. Thomas, 196 S.W.3d 396, 399 (TexApp. Houston [1 st Dist.] 2006)\n\nexplained:\n\n       The mootness doctrine limits courts to deciding cases in which an actual controversy\n       exists.\" A controversy \"must exist between the parties at every stage of the legal\n       proceedings ...

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n63; Sosa v. Central Power & Light, 909 S.W.2d 893, 895 (Tex. 1995). Since the trial is not\n\nscheduled until July 20, 2015, Contestant may amend her pleading anytime prior to July 13,\n\n2015. Contestee has not asserted surprise from Contestant's amended pleading. Contestant has\n\nfiled a Sixth Amended Contest based on the partial discovery provided by the Travis County\n\nClerk.

REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE\n\n2.        Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, and the motion set forth below, the plaintiff\n\nrequests that the defendants, within thirty days of the service of the Original Petition, disclose the\n\ninformation and material described in Rule 194.2.\n\n                                             III. SUMMARY\n\n3.         This contest is based on the facts that illegal votes were counted, election officers prevented\n\neligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal votes, and election officers made\n\nmistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true outcome. Thus, deprivation of\n\nvoting rights of voters in several high population polling locations which were improperly closed,\n\nirregularity in votes counted or not counted, and a failure to comply with the Texas Election Code\n\nrequirement for storing, retrieval and printing of \"images of ballots cast\" in electronic voting\n\nmachines occurred and negatively affected the outcome for Pressley. Particularly, the improper\n\nclosure, consolidation and moving of the voting locations alone appears to have reduced the vote\n\nconsiderably more than the margin reported in the canvass of the election. 2\n\n4.        Additionally, Travis County uses electronic voting machines from Hart Intercivic to conduct\n\n\n\n2This is sufficient to \"materially affect[] the election results.\" Gonzalez v. Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d\n763,773,777-78 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2008, pet. dism'd w.o.j.) (quoting Tiller v. Martinez, 974\nS.W.2d 769,772 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1998, pet. dism'd w.o.j.)

Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                  p.2\n                                                                                                             1539\n\felections within the county? Pressley requests that the court compel Travis County election officers\n\nto print the \"images of ballots cast\" as required under the Texas Election Code. 4 (TEX. ELEC. CODE\n\n§213.016). Without these statutorily-required \"images of ballots cast\" it is impossible for the Court\n\nto determine the actual election outcome, as the only actual ballots - the mail-in ballots - are exactly\n\nand perfectly tied between the two candidates. The Travis County Clerk has asserted that the system\n\nTravis County uses cannot print \"images of ballots cast.\" Images of ballots cast\" is not the same as\n\n\"cast vote records.\" The Court, consequently, must reject any \"cast vote records\" produced and\n\ntallied by such machines. The result of these multiple irregularities is that the result cannot be\n\nknown, and the Court must order a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such an election be\n\ntimely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Election Code and the Secretary of State's\n\nregulations governing elections.\n\n5.     \"The purpose of the election code is to ensure that the true will of the voters is 'fairly expressed'\n\nand that the evidence of that expression is 'properly preserved.' Prado [v. Johnson, 625 S.W.2d 368\n\n\n3 Voters in different parts of the state utilize a number of different voting systems, all of which must\nfirst be certified by the Secretary of State. Tex. Elec. Code § 122.001, .031. ... Once a system is\ncertified, local political subdivisions may adopt it for use in elections. Id. § 123.001. ...\nThe eSlate, a paperless DRE manufactured by Hart Intercivic, is one of a handful ofDREs the\nSecretary has certified. See Voting Systems, Texas Secretary of State,\nhttp://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/votingsystems.shtml. Voters arriving at the polls in\ncounties using the eSlate are given a unique access code. The voter enters the code into the eSlate,\nwhich then displays the ballot. Voters tum a dial to highlight their ballot choice and then press\n\"enter\" to make a selection. After a voter completes his selections, the eSlate displays a ballot\nsummary page. If the voter's choices are correctly displayed, the voter presses the \"cast ballot\"\nbutton, and the vote is purportedly recorded. See Voter Instructions, Travis County,\nhttp://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk!election!eSlate/pdfs/English_Flyer_ 050923. pdf.

The failures and mistakes illustrated\n\nin this Contest show that the will of voters was thwarted, the evidence of that expression was not\n\nproperly preserved and thus, the true outcome cannot be determined. 5\n\n6.        While some actual ballots were preserved - the mail-in ballots, in which the candidates are\n\nperfectly tied - the vast majority of ballots and the evidence of the voters' intent were not preserved.\n\nAccording to the Travis County Clerk, there are no \"images of ballots cast\" that the court can\n\nreview. Therefore, if \"images of ballots cast\" cannot be produced, we request the court to order a\n\nnew election.\n\n\n                                             IV. PARTIES\n\n7.        Contestant Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis County,\n\nTexas. She was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on December 16,\n\n2014.\n\n8.        Contestee Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas.      He was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on\n\nDecember 16,2014. Casar has been served and has answered in this cause.\n\n9.        The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar was declared the\n\nvictor.\n\n10.       A \"manual recount\" of all early voting, election day, provisional, and mailed-in ballots was\n\nattempted on January 6, 2015. 6 The mail-in ballots were exactly tied between the candidates, at 240\n\n\n\n5 The requirement to preserve \"images of ballots cast\" in the statute is fundamental to preserving the\nevidence of the will of the voters. By failing to preserve that evidence, the County has destroyed\nevidence of the expression of the will of the voters and forced the court to call a new election.\n6 Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.4\n                                                                                                           1541\n\feach, for a total of 480 votes. 7 The attempted recount was a nullity and a real recount was made\n\nimpossible in that the attempted recount violated state law and was incorrectly performed using of the\n\n\"cast vote records\" in lieu of \"images of ballots cast\" combined with the actual mail in ballots. Based\n\non the counting of \"cast vote records\" and mail in ballots, as could be predicted, the invalid recount did\n\nnot change the reported results of the election and the original declaration of Mr. Casar as the victor for\n\nthe run off election did not change. Casar was sworn into office on January 6, 2014.         He has been\n\nnotified of the filing of this action by a delivery of a copy of this Petition in accordance with TEX.\n\nELEC. CODE § 21.003(b).\n\n                                 v. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n11.     Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                               VI. FACTS\n\n            Travis County Election Officials Prevented Eligible Voters from Voting\n\n12.     City of Austin District 4, comprised of 18 voting precincts, is located entirely           III   Travis\n\nCounty. Early Voting and Election Day was December 1-12, and 16, 2014, respectively.                     Voters\n\nseeking to vote at high-volume locations were improperly denied the right to cast their vote.\n\nDisenfranchisement of District 4 voters occurred as a result of the closing of the highest volume\n\nDistrict 4 voting locations in the Run Off during Early Voting and Election Day, December 16,\n\n\ndid not satisfy statutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a\nstatutory manual recount as defined by the Texas Election Code.\n7 These were the only actual ballots counted during the \"manual recount.\" The mail-in ballots were\nmore than 10% of the total ballots cast in the election. The allegation of the county is that, despite\nthe perfect tie in mail-in ballots, Casar beat Pressley by a 2-to-1 margin in the remaining ballots.\nThis is a variation in election results that is highly improbable and unrecorded to Contestant's\nknowledge.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                   p.5\n                                                                                                                  1542\n\f2014.\n\n13.     The Highland Mall voting location at 6601 Airport Blvd was open during the General\n\nElection for Early Voting and Election Day on October 20-31, and November 4, 2014,\n\nrespectively and saw some of the highest volume of voters in District 4. This location was the\n\ndesignated voting location for Precinct 142 and was an important and convenient voting location\n\nfor Precinct 156 and others nearby. It was closed for the December Run Off election for Early\n\nVoting and Election Day. It was moved to the far less convenient Travis County Tax Office at\n\n5501 Airport Blvd (See Appendix 1). The Pressley campaign received multiple reports of voters\n\nbeing upset and confused because the voting location had been moved.\n\n14.     Specifically, reports were received by Contestant on Election Day, December 16th , from\n\nvoters while Contestant was phone banking. District 4 voter, Thomas Crawford showed up at\n\nCooke Elementary to vote, and reported no signs were posted to indicate where the polling\n\nlocation had been moved. Similar reports were received by Brad Parsons, a campaign volunteer,\n\nwho was phone banking on Election Day. Campaign supporter, Matthew Palmer reported that\n\nHighland Mall was closed and it was a problem for voters.        Based on information and belief,\n\nContestant asserts that said confusion was a result of failure to post, or premature removal of, a\n\nnotice at Cooke Elementary, Precinct 222, of the relocation of the polling place.\n\n15.     Upon reviewing voter rolls for Pct 156 and 142, published by Travis County, Appendix 2\n\nshows names, addresses and precincts of 365 voters of Pcts 156 and 142 that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 365 voters were identified based on their voting histories which include\n\nbut are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary\n\nElections. The extensive voting histories of these 365 voters show they are the most consistent\n\nvoters in Precincts 142 and 156 and surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                           p.6\n                                                                                                     1543\n\fin 2014.   In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters, multiple times, as very\n\nstrong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs posted), who were waiting\n\nto vote on Election Day. These voters total 73. Therefore, Contestant alleges a total of 438 voters\n\nin Precincts 142 and 156 were disenfranchised.\n\n16.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (detailed voter information of\n\nprecincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting in the General and\n\nRun off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County.      Upon receipt and\n\nreview of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify additional voters and\n\nimprove the accuracy of this list.    Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of collecting\n\naffidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n17.    The second highest voting precinct and polling location in District 4 for the November\n\nGeneral Election was Precinct 222 at Cooke Elementary located at 1511 Cripple Creek. That\n\nPrecinct is comprised of more than 25% senior voters who are 60 years and older. It was closed\n\nduring Election Day for the December Run Off (See Appendix 1). It was combined with the\n\nfourth lowest voter turnout location in District 4, Precinct 268, Grant AME Worship Center at\n\n1701 Kramer Lane.\n\n18.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Rob Hale, a resident and voter in Pct 222.\n\nAs usual, he and other Pct 222 voters showed up to Cooke Elementary for the December Run Off\n\non Election Day and were confused as to why Cooke Elementary was closed for voting for Pct\n\n222. He helped senior voters look up an alternative location in which to vote on Kramer Lane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Kramer location, he waited for the senior voters and they did not arrive. In\n\naddition, he had a relative that showed up at Cooke Elementary to vote, and the relative reported\n\nno signs were posted to indicate where the polling location had been moved.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.7\n                                                                                                       1544\n\f19.    Upon reviewing Pct 222 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 3 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 248 voters that we allege were disenfranchised. These 248 voters have\n\nvoting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin\n\nCouncil Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 248 voters show\n\nthey are the most consistent voters in Precinct 222 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City\n\nCouncil Run off election in 2014.     In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters,\n\nmultiple times, as very strong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs\n\nposted), which were waiting to vote on Election Day. These voters total 71. Therefore, Contestant\n\nalleges a total of319 voters in Precinct 222 alone were disenfranchised.\n\n20.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (such as detailed voter\n\ninformation such as precincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting\n\nin the General and Run off elections), has been requested through Discovery from Travis County.\n\nUpon receipt and review of Discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify\n\nadditional voters and improve the accuracy of this list. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process\n\nof collecting affidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n21.    Another voting location open during the General Election but closed for the District 4 Run\n\noff was Precinct 133, which was open for the General Election at Blanton Elementary located at\n\n5408 Westminster. It was combined with the non-District 4 Precinct 130, at Memorial UMC.\n\n22.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Pct 133, Election Judge, Arthur Turner, a\n\nresident and voter in Pct 133. During Election Day, voters from Pct 133, showed up at Blanton\n\nElementary to vote in the Run Off and were confused and upset as to why Blanton Elementary was\n\nclosed for voting for Pct 133. Mr. Turner had multiple calls from upset voters who did not know\n\nwhere to vote.\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.8\n                                                                                                         1545\n\f23.    Upon reviewing Pct 133 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 4 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 116 voters Contestant alleges were disenfranchised. These 116 voters\n\nhave voting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of\n\nAustin Council Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 116\n\nvoters show they are the most consistent voters in Precinct 133 and they surprisingly did not vote\n\nin the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n24.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (such as detailed voter\n\ninformation such as precincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting\n\nin the General and Run off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County.\n\nUpon receipt and review of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify\n\nadditional voters and improve the accuracy of this list. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process\n\nof collecting affidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n25.    Three additional polling locations were closed for the Run off election for District 4 (Pcts\n\n209, 258, and 260).     Upon reviewing the voter rolls for these precincts published by Travis\n\nCounty, Appendix 5 shows names, addresses and precincts of 235 voters that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 235 voters have voting histories which include but are not limited to\n\nvoting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary Elections.             The\n\nextensive voting histories of these 235 voters show they are the most consistent voters in Precincts\n\n209,258, and 260 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n26.    The total number of closed/moved/combined precincts in District 4 for the Run off comes\n\nto a total of 7 Precincts out of 17 voting precincts in District 4. Therefore, 41 % of District 4's\n\npolling locations were closed, combined or moved for the December Austin City Council Run off.\n\nAppendix 6. This caused a much lower than expected turnout for Election Day for District 4.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.9\n                                                                                                         1546\n\f27.    To summarize, typically Election Day and Early Voting tum out is very similar. Early\n\nVoting for the District 4 Run Off race saw approximately 2,646 voters and on Election Day only\n\n1,771 turned out. Due closing/ moving/ combining of 41 % of District 4 Polling locations, voters\n\nwere confused and disenfranchised and Election Day voters were about 875 short.\n\n28.    The County's actions of closing multiple, key, high volume polling locations had a\n\ndisproportionate effect on minorities, working people, and elderly voters of District 4-one of the\n\nHispanic-opportunity districts in the City of Austin.        Four of Pressley's strongest voting\n\nlocations/boxes that showed over 50% for Pressley (222, 156, 133, 258), as evidenced by the only\n\nremaining ballots, Mail in Ballot results, were moved or closed for the Run Off election (See\n\nAppendix 6).\n\n\n\n29.    As a result of these aggressive and improper closures, voters registered at those locations\n\nwere improperly denied the right to cast their vote. The closure of these pro-Pressley precincts was\n\nunfair and undermined the true outcome of the election. A conservative count of disenfranchised\n\nvoters resulting from the improper closure/moving/combining of precincts 133, 142, 156, 209,\n\n222, 258, and 260 is 1,108. This value is consistent with the low voter turnout on Election\n\nDay as compared to Early Voting. Upon evaluation of discovery responses from Travis County,\n\na more accurate number may be provided. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of obtaining\n\ntestimony regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n\n\nTravis County Election Officials Allowed Ineligible Voters to Cast Votes (Illegal Votes)\n\n30.       A thorough review the 4,414 Early Voting and Election Day voter names and addresses\n\nwith returned mail, and the National Change of Address database (NCOA), and voter registration\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.lO\n                                                                                                       1547\n\frecords available online, 64 of the voters had moved, no longer resided in District 4, or had some\n\nother residency issues, and may not have been eligible to vote in the District 4 Run Off Election.\n\nTherefore, at least 64 ineligible voters cast votes in this election due to residency issues. A\n\nmore detailed review of the voter registrar information provided by Travis County is needed with\n\nregard to Provisional Ballots, statements of residence, etc. Upon evaluation of Discovery\n\nresponses from Travis County, a more accurate number may be provided. A list of the 64 voter's\n\nVoter ID's and precincts are found in Appendix 7.\n\n31.    \\Vith regard to additional categories for illegal votes, it is unlikely that voters that are not\n\ninterested in voting in a General Election will be interested in voting in a Run Off election. After\n\nreviewing Travis County voter rolls (https:lltax-office.traviscountytx.gov/voter-data), for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off, 156 voters voted in the Run Off that did not vote in the General\n\nElection. Many are Ballot by Mails and a large number voted at specific locations. These are\n\npotentially illegal votes and we ask the court to allow Contestant time to review and evaluate\n\nvarious Discovery responses from Travis County voting records including, but not limited to,\n\nBallot by Mail, voter registration cards, polling location sign in sheets, and residency records, etc.\n\nto validate the votes were cast legally. A List of these voters are found in Appendix 8.\n\n                 More Ballots Than Voters During Early Voting (megaI Votes)\n\n32.    On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, the Mayor of Austin and the Austin City Council\n\nconducted an initial official canvass and certification for the Election Day results for all races\n\non the ballot, including City of Austin District 4. The canvassed and certified totals for District\n\n4 were Laura Pressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n33.    The canvassed results were inconsistent with the Early Voting voter reports. Travis County\n\nreported that 2,651 total voters voted in Early Voting in District 4. Reviewing the voter ID's, 437\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.ll\n                                                                                                          1548\n\fentries existed for those submitting Ballot by Mail (BBM). There were at least 28 duplicate entries for\n\nBBM. At least 28 mail-in votes appear to have been counted twice or three times. See Appendix 6,\n\nDuplicate Ballot by Mail Entries.\n\n34.     Once duplicate BBM's were removed, 2,622 voter names remained that voted in Early Voting\n\naccording to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that were distributed prior to Election Day,\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for\n\nGreg Casar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number of ballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. Therefore, there are 80 more ballots than voters for Early Voting. These 80 extra ballots are\n\ndistributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4 Race. 8 (One precinct, with one eligible voter,\n\nshowed no votes.) See Appendix 7, Early Voting Discrepancies.\n\n                                      Statistical Improbabilities\n\n35.    An analysis of the voting results show a pattern of mathematical anomalies which is highly\n\nunlikely to occur naturally. (See Appendix 8, pages 1-3.) For the nine (9) precincts in District 4\n\nwith more than 200 voters,9 the highest volume of voters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant\n\nreceived compared to Contestee is the same ratio in the November General Election (with a total\n\nof 8 candidates) as it was in the December Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 35.1 % vs 35.0%\n\nrespectively.   In addition, the average of the percentages of the unweighted precincts that the\n\nContestant received compared to Contestee, in the November General Election and the December\n\nRun Off, are also equal at 35.1 % and 35.1 %, respectively. No other Council race in the history of\n\nelectronic voting in the City (2003 - current) has shown such a tight non-variation between a\n\n\n8 In the original petition, this number was identified as 79. One precinct, 211, had a single vote\nundervote. See Appendix 7, Early Voting Discrepancies.\" Additionally, there are an unknown\nnumber of ballot by mail overvotes, invalid voter registrations, ineligible voters and election day\novervotes.\n9 These precincts account for more than 80% of the vote in the District.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.12\n                                                                                                             1549\n\fgeneral election and a run off. Since 2003, of the total eleven Council races that went into a run\n\noft: seven races have greater than lOx variation and 3 show greater than 100x variation. See\n\nattached Appendix 8, Comparison of Election Returns.\n\n36.     The fact that so many precincts showed exactly the same and unchanged results for the General\n\nElection and the Run Off is indicative of mistakes made by Travis County election officers. These\n\nmistakes are likely related to and are due to, but not limited to, the handling of voter hardware,\n\nsoftware, etc.\n\n37.         From Travis County Voter Rolls, though over 4,000 voters were different between the\n\nGeneral and Run Off elections, the unique and unlikely occurrence that the results remain unchanged\n\nand which has not occurred in the last 11 years in Travis County for any other Run Otf candidate or\n\nelection is highly improbable. The occurrence is surprising, is strictly isolated to District 4, and is\n\nindicative of human error. Because so many high volume District 4 precincts showed exactly the same\n\npercentage results for Pressley and Casar, it is possible that some memory cards or counting software\n\nused in the General Election were mistakenly reused in error for the Run Off.\n\n38.         Contestee Casar alleges the factual and statistically improbable election results for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off \"are unsurprising.\" This is indicative of emotional wishful thinking\n\nrather than a clear-eyed analytical assessment of evidence and data. Additionally, Casar offers vague\n\nand irrelevant references and personal attacks from a politically biased news source, the far-left Austin\n\nChronicle. The Chronicle endorsed and directly campaigned for Contestee Casar. Additionally, the\n\nChronicle has little to no scientific expertise on staff that is qualified to offer expert testimony on\n\ncomplex topics of mathematics, chemistry, physics and engineering, which they attempt to report and\n\ncritique.\n\n39.

Several election safeguards and procedures defined by the Legislature and the Secretary of\n\nState that are intended to prevent human errors were mistakenly not followed by Travis County. The\n\nmistakes and failure to adhere to the Secretary of State's procedures led to and caused illegal votes to be\n\ncounted.\n\n41.        With regard to the counting of illegal votes, during Early and Election Day Voting, many\n\nelection irregularities occurred and mistakes were made by Travis County election officers.\n\nAccording to Travis County Election Division director Michael Winn, no Zero Tapes to were printed\n\nfor machines to verify that directly prior to the first votes being cast, no votes were pre-registered on\n\n\n10 A \"zero tape\" is run on the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to ensure no votes reside in the\n\nsystem.

Given so many high volume District 4 precincts showed exactly the same percentage results\n\nfor Pressley and Casar, it is possible that some memory cards or counting software used in the General\n\nElection were mistakenly reused in error for the Run Off. (See Appendix 8.)\n\n43.         In addition, with regard to illegal votes being counted, on Election Day, no results tapes\n\nwere printed at the countywide locations when closing the polls. The SOS procedures require the\n\nprinting of closing results tapes, also.    This failure is in violation of Texas Secretary of State\n\nrequirements.

Results Tapes were not printed as\n            required          by          Secretary          of         State         procedures\n                                                                              This affected the\n\n\n11 Travis County received a waiver of the state requirement for such tapes for the general election\nonly in a letter dated September 30,2014, based on the burden of the extremely long statewide\nballot. See attached Appendix 10, September 30, 2014 letter from Texas Secretary of State.\nThe run-off election ballot includes only City Council and Mayoral candidates. The run-off was\nrestricted to two candidates in the races requiring a run-off, unlike the first round, in which as many\nas twelve candidates participated in some races.\n\n\nPressley v.

This affected the outcome of the Run off election in that errors in counting,\n            ballots cast, and voters signing in, and maintaining security protocols may have occurred.\n         c) Sergio and Claire Martinez were denied access to Dobie Middle School, SubStation on\n            December 16, 2014 and were not able to monitor for election materials coming from Gus\n            Garcia. This affected the outcome of the Run off election in that errors in counting,\n            maintaining security protocols may have occurred.\n\n44.      This violates Secretary of State regulations requiring that poll watchers be allowed to sign\n\nsuch tapes. \"The presiding election judge, an election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if\n\none or more watchers are present, shall sign the results tape(s).\" The Travis County officers\n\nviolations affected the outcome of the election because votes may have remained on the voting\n\nequipment from prior activities or excess votes may have been added before or after the close of\n\nthe polls and the lack of \"images of ballots cast\" makes the results impossible to verify.

The eSlate system is comprised of several\ndistinct components.\nThe Ballot Origination Software System (\"BOSS\") is used by election officials to define and create\nindividualized electronic ballots. Data is entered once into BOSS and then flows through all\ncomponents of the eSlate system.\nThe Mobile Ballot Box (\"MBB\") is a reusable, portable flash memory card. It is used to store and\ntransfer election information. When inserted into the Judge's Booth Controller, the MBB supplies\nelection information and ballot styles, it stores an electronic representation of how votes were cast.\nOnce voting has concluded the MBB is removed and its contents are tallied by the Tally software.\nThe Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") is the \"brain\" that manages the system, enabling poll workers\nto know which voting booths are in use at any time. The JBC issues access codes for the voters' use.\nIt can control up to 12 daisy-chained eSlate units.\neSlate refers to the system generally and to the device that voters use to cast ballots, unless using\npaper ballots, in which case Ballot Now is used. The eSlate may be equipped with a disabled access\nunit (\"DAU\") for use by disabled voters. The eSlate units are physically connected to the JBC,\nwhich stores cast-vote records.\nTally is a software application that reads, stores, and tabulates the cast-vote records from the MBB\n(the portable flash card that transferred the cast-vote records from the JBC). Tally tabulates all early\nvoting, absentee, and election day results, and produces various reports.\nRally is a software application that is capable of reading, storing, and transferring cast-vote data\nfrom polling places or collection centers with respect to early returns.\nThe System for Election Records and Verification Operations (\"SERVO\") software is an election\nrecords archiving and asset management system. SERVO is designed to recover data from\nequipment in the case of a lost or damaged MBB. SERVO also is designed for various recount\npurposes.\nBallot Now is a digital-scan paper ballot system that manages the printing, scanning, and resolution\nof mailed-in paper ballots. It also records the electronic cast vote records to an MBB to be read and\ntabulated with Tally.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                  p.l7\n                                                                                                           1554\n\f                                             The Recount\n\n                                        Illegal Votes Counted\n\n47.    Because of the previously noted, highly improbable statistical anomalies l3 , the duplicate\n\nBallot by Mail entries, and the fact that there are more ballots than number of voters for Early\n\nVoting (overvotes), Contestant requested a manual recount of the Di strict 4 Election with the goal\n\nof reconciling the discrepancies.\n\n48.        Contestant claims the recount evidence and findings are critically material to this case\n\nand the allegations are legally relevant to this election contest.\n\n49.    The recount failed to only count legal votes because \"images of ballots cast\" were not\n\nprovided and counted.      Printing the \"cast vote record\" or \"CVR\" data files was in essence\n\nreprinting the previous electronically counted results obtained on Election night. A CVR prints\n\ndata from a data file to a template; it does not count the \"images of ballots cast\" - it merely\n\nreprints the tally on separate sheets of paper. It was not recounting the source data of the \"images\n\nof ballots cast,\" and as such it is not a meaningful check on the original count. 14 Using the CVR\n\n\n13 See Appendix 8.\n14 The Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (All dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.) In its 2014 Electronic Voting System\nProcedures bulletin, posted online at                  .\n                           the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot\nimages. See, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8 - Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEC § 214.071):\n1. The candidate requesting a recount may request that the recount be done electronically or\n        manually.\n2. For an electronic recount, the persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n        also authorized to be present as the election media are reloaded into the central accumulator\n        system.\n3. For a manual recount of a DRE election, the Recount Coordinator shall organize the printing of\n        cast vote records (ballot images) for the affected race or issue.\n\n\nPressley v.

In addition, on January 5, 2015, Dr. Pressley communicated over the phone with the\n\nDirector of Travis County Elections Division. Pressley informed the Director that she desired to\n\nbe present during the printing of images of ballots cast. An email was sent to The Travi s County\n\nClerk and copied to the Texas Secretary of State's Office, to the same effect.\n\n52.

On Tuesday, January 6, 2015, at 11:00 a.m. (See Appendix 12) when the recount was to\n\nbegin, the Travis County Clerk and the Recount Committee relayed to Contestant and her official\n\nrecount watcher, Karen Renick, that images of ballots cast were not available, would not be\n\nprinted, and would not be used for the recount. 16 Dr. Pressley expressly stated, in her \"Petition\n\nRequesting a Recount,\" and \"Amended Petition Requesting a Recount\" that \"[w]e are requesting a\n\nmanual recount of the results using the actual, stored, ballot images.\"          (See Appendix 11.)\n\nPressley also expressly requested \"a manual (by-hand) count.\" \"[T]he election code expressly\n\nprovides for the 'printing of images of ballots cast using direct recording electronic voting\n\nmachines for the purpose of a recount.'

Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.012, the committee chair prepared a report of the vote\n\ncount. The Travis County Clerk and the Director of the Elections Division repeatedly informed\n\nDr. Pressley that \"it was not the scope of the Recount\" to reconcile the ballots with the number of\n\nvoters. The chair wrote, \"The numbers of voters matched the number of ballots cast,\" and signed\n\nthe report (See Attached Appendix 14, \"Recount Affidavit of Jay Brim\"). During the Recount, the\n\nnumbers of voters on voter lists were not publicly reconciled with the ballots recounted by the\n\nchair.   Dr. Pressley commented to the chair, \"Matching the numbers was not supposedly done\n\ntoday,\" and no explanation was provided by the chair.\n\n62.      On January 5, 2015, the Mayor of Austin and City Clerk approved Contestant's amended\n\npetition requesting a manual recount of actual stored \"images of ballots cast.,,19 Contestant's amended\n\npetition included a request to reconcile the ballots cast with the number of voters documented on the sign\n\nin sheets and combination fomls for District 4 for the countywide polling locations and Precincts to\n\nensure accurate reporting of results. The number of voters recorded and the number of votes recorded\n\ndid not match.\n\n         Ballot by Mail Ballots Are The Only Legal Ballots That Are Properly Preserved\n\n63.       This is why printing the \"images of the ballots cast\" is critical. The ballot in the General\n\nElection was very different (8 candidates) from the ballot in the Run Off (2 candidates). If some\n\nmemory cards or counting software were reused by mistake, then the \"images of the ballots cast\" will\n\ninstantly and unmistakably distinguish the tme votes from the illegal votes. This is the intent of the\n\n19 Texas Election Code §213.016.\nSec. 213.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING\nELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES. During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct\nrecording electronic voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\nrequired to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many committee members\nmust be present during the printing of the images. Each candidate is entitled to be present and to\nhave representatives present in the same number as prescribed by Section 213.0 13(b) for a recount\nduring the printing of the images.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.24\n                                                                                                             1561\n\f\"images of ballots cast\" language of the law. Which ballots were counted is the question that can be\n\nanswered only by review of the \"images of ballots cast.\"\n\n64.       The mandatory nature of this requirement becomes clear in context.\n\n          [W]e believe that violations of certain recording provisions by election clerks can\n          certainly undermine the purpose of the election code and obscure the true will of the\n          qualified voters.\n\nGonzalez v. Villareal, 251 S.W.3d at 778\n\n65.       Failure to retain \"image of ballots cast,\" \"ballots\" and or \"ballot originals\" is precisely such\n\na violation, because there is no clear and unequivocal record of the voter's intent, absent such an\n\nImage.\n\n66.          Given the facts and the election mistakes made by Travis County election officers, all of the\n\n4,023 votes that show to be cast in person, are in question and must be verified. Therefore, we ask the\n\nCourt to compel Travis County to print and tally the \"images of ballots cast\" for the District 4 Run Off\n\nso the court may ascertain whether the outcome as shown by the canvass is not the true outcome\n\nbecause illegal votes were counted. The list of the 4,023 voters and their Voter ID' s are provided in\n\nAppendix 15.\n\n67.       The recount included the Ballot by Mail ballots, and those specific results for Pressley and\n\nCasar were determined?O Ballot by Mail Votes were cast in seventeen of the eighteen precincts of\n\nDistrict 4. 21 Pressley received 240 votes and Casar received 240 votes of the 480 total votes cast\n\nfor either candidate for the Ballot by Mail ballots. Pressley received exactly 50% of the votes.\n\n68.       The Ballot by Mail result is very different from the 33.3 and 33.8% Pressley is reported to\n\nha ve received for early voting and election day voting from the \"cast vote records\" - a variation\n\nfrom mail-in votes and non-mail-in votes of almost 20% (See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount\n\n20   See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount Results.\"\n21   One precinct, with a population of a single voter, showed no votes.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.25\n                                                                                                             1562\n\fResults\").\n\n69.    The only actual \"ballots\" that were preserved and counted during the recount show\n\nPressley and Casar split the vote exactly in half. Moreover, 10 of the 18 precincts showed 50% or\n\nmore of the vote for Pressley. The Ballot by Mail ballots that were cast for either candidate (total\n\nof 480 votes) were over 10% of the total ballots cast for the Run Off election.\n\n70.          The 480 Ballot by Mail ballots are the only\" ballots,\" as that term is defined in the\n\nElection Code, which were available and counted during the recount.            Therefore, the election\n\nshould have been re-canvassed only with the 480 Ballot by Mail \"ballots\" and not the results\n\nincluding the 4,023 illegally recounted \"cast vote records.\"\n\n71.    This is an additional reason for the court to compel the Travis County Clerk to comply with\n\nTEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.016 22 and 214.049 (e?3 to print and count the statutorily required \"images\n\nof ballots cast\" and ascertain whether the previous outcome of the election is not the true outcome.\n\n72.    On January 6, 2015, the recount was conducted and completed. After the recount, the\n\ntotals were unchanged as compared to the original canvassed results.           The totals were Laura\n\nPressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n73.    Reconciliation ofvoier signatures on rolls at polling locations and total ballots cast has not\n\nbeen completed. An election contest is the only available remedy to explore the discrepancy\n\nbetween the number of ballots counted and the number of voter names and signatures in the\n\nprecincts.\n\n74.    The sum total of all voting irregularities identified herein exceeds the number of votes by\n\n\n\n22 \"PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING ELECTRONIC\nVOTING MACHINES\"\n23\"If electronic voting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original ballot, rather than\nthe duplicate of the original ballot, shall be counted.\"\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.26\n                                                                                                         1563\n\fwhich the election was decided.\n\n75.     If no \"images of ballots cast\" can be retrieved, printed and counted, Travis County cannot\n\nunequivocally determine the outcome of the election. The Court may order each of the more than\n\n4,000 voters who voted in person to testify as to how they voted, pursuant to Texas Election Code\n\nSec. 221.010. \"SECONDARY            EVIDENCE        FOR UNAVAILABLE              BALLOTS.      If an\n\nexamination of ballots is needed in an election contest and the ballots are lost, destroyed, or\n\notherwise beyond the reach of the tribunal, the voters who cast the ballots may testify as to how\n\nthey voted.\"\n\n76.     In the alternative, if Travis County cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\" to be printed\n\nand counted, then Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and\n\nthe election is void. As a matter oflaw, the Court must therefore order a new election. TEX. ELEC.\n\nCODE § 232.041. 24\n\n                                 VII. PETITION TIMELY FILED\n\n77.

VIOLATIONS OF LAW\n\n Texas Election Code Violation\n\n Lack of Notice of Relocation of Polling Place\n\n 82.    The facts asserted above are included herein by reference. Contestant claims that voters\n\n were disenfranchised due to the failure of Travis County to provide and/or maintain an adequate\n\n notice at the general election polling place (Highland Mall and other voting locations identified\n\n herein) detailing the relocation of the polling place to the Travis County offices for the runoff\n\n election in December 2014. Such failure to provide notice of relocation of the polling place for\n\n the runoff election is a violation of Texas Election Code § 43.062. Section 43.062 states:\n\n       Sec. 43.062. NOTICE AT PREVIOUS POLLING PLACE. Ifthe location of the\n       polling place for an election precinct is different from the location used for the\n       precinct in the preceding election ordered by the same authority, the authority\n       responsible for giving notice of the election shall, if possible, post notice at the\n       entrance to the previous polling place stating that the location has changed and\n       providing the location of the new polling place.\n\n       Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 802, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1,2001.\n\n Contestant seeks an order requiring a vacation of the runoff election and an order requiring a\n\n properly noticed runoff election be held forthwith.\n\n\n\nFailure to Provide \"Images of Ballots Cast\"\n\n83.     Contestant asserts that the December 2014 runoff fails to comply with the statutory\n\nrequirements of the Texas Election Code Chapters 128 and 213. Section 128.001 states:\n\n       Sec. 128.001. COMPUTERIZED VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.28\n                                                                                                     1565\n\f       (a) The secretary of state shall prescribe procedures to allow for the use of a\n       computerized voting system. The procedures must provide for the use of a\n       computerized voting system with:\n             (1) multiple voting terminals for the input of vote selections on the ballot\n             presented by a main computer; and\n             (2) a main computer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection,\n             ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\n\n\n84.    Section 213.016 states:\n\n       Sec. 213.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT\n       RECORDING ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES.\n\n       During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct recording electronic\n       voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\n       required to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many\n       committee members must be present during the printing of the images. Each\n       candidate is entitled to be present and to have representatives present during the\n       printing of the images in the same number as Section 213.013(b) prescribes for\n       watchers for a recount.\n\n       Added by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 583, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1,2003.\n       Amended by:\n               Acts 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., Ch. 1235 (S.B. 1970), Sec. 22, eff. September\n       1,2009.\n\n\n 85.    As asserted above, the Travis County Clerk cannot provide \"images of ballots cast\" for\n\n purposes of a recount in the December runoff election as required by the Texas Election Code.\n\n Because the Travis County Clerk cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\", the ballots cast on the\n\n electronic voting machines cannot be verified. Contestant seeks an order from this case vacating\n\n the December 2014 runoff election. Since the only verifiable votes in the December runoff are\n\n the ballots by mail, said votes resulting in a tie in the runoff, Contestant seeks an order from this\n\n Court directing that another nmoff election be conducted and that the Travis County Clerk\n\n provide \"images of ballots cast\" in such a runoff election for purposes of allowing all affected\n\n parties to verify the results of said runoff in compliance with the above-referenced provisions of\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.29\n                                                                                                         1566\n\f the Texas Election Code.\n\n\n\n Violation ofSection 2 of the Federal Voting Rights Act\n\n 86.    Contestant asserts that failure to provide notice at the general election polling place of the\n\n relocation of the polling place for the runoff has a disproportionate impact on minority voters in\n\n violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 42 U.S.c. §§ 1973b(f), 1973l(c)(3» (now 52\n\n USC 10303) bars voting discrimination against certain language minorities--specifically, persons\n\n of American Indian, Asian American, Native Alaskan, and Spanish heritage. Members of the\n\n protected class of Spanish heritage in Precincts 142 and 156 (Appendix 1) were disenfranchised\n\n by the confusion created by the lack of notice of the change in polling place for the December\n\n 2014 runoff election. Contestant seeks an injunction from this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.c.\n\n § 1983 vacating the runoff election and requiring a new runoff election forthwith.\n\n\n\n           IX. MOTION TO MODIFY STANDARD DISCOVERY PROCEDURES\n\n87.     Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 191.1, Contestants request that the Court sign\n\nan order shortening the time allowed for Contestee to comply with the discovery requests set forth\n\nbelow to no more than fifteen days.\n\n88.     Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 191.1, Contestants request that the Court sign\n\nan order shortening the time allowed for Contestee and third-party witnesses, voters, the City of\n\nAustin and Travis County, to comply with the discovery requests set forth below in paragraph to\n\nno more than ten days, and that the period of notice required for Deposition on Written Questions\n\nbe reduced to ten days.\n\n89.     Contestants further requests that the Court slgn an order requmng that Contestee's\n\n\n\nPressley v.

The foregoing modifications to standard discovery procedures are necessary because of\n\nthe accelerated procedures that apply to this election contest. The foregoing reasons constitute\n\ngood cause for the requested relief.\n\n                        X. RESPONSE TO SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS\n\n                                           Introduction\n\n91.    Dr. Pressley has found indisputable election irregularities and mistakes that were made in\n\nconducting the District 4 election held on December 16, 2014 that show the outcome as shown by\n\nthe final canvass is not accurate and she is bringing this election contest. Because illegal votes were\n\ncounted, eligible voters were prevented from voting, legal votes were not counted, and Travis\n\nCounty election officers made errors and mistakes, Dr. Pressley is asking, pursuant to Section\n\n221.003 (a), for the \"court to ascertain whether the outcome of the District 4 Run Off election, as\n\nshown by the canvass, is not the true outcome.\"      If a contestant is prevented by the county clerk\n\nfrom proving the actual number of legal votes by the clerk's act of not preserving or requiring or\n\ncounting images of the ballots actually cast there is no way to conclude the clerk reported the true\n\noutcome . Without the images of the actual ballots there is not a true outcome and the run-off\n\nelection must be repeated preserving the images of the ballots cast as provided and required by state\n\nlaw.\n\n92.    Contestee alleges Dr. Pressley is attacking the entire state-wide electronic-voting system. In\n\nfact, the contest is limited solely to the discrete errors made by the Travis County Clerk's office in\n\nthis single election. All counties are capable of complying with the law and preserving images of\n\nthe actual ballots cast by a voter. Travis county just elected to ignore that law and the sound public\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.3l\n                                                                                                          1568\n\fpolicy behind it. It cannot certify a true outcome by reason of its own misconduct in this election\n\nthat is at issue in this case.\n\n93.       Weaknesses in the Travis County Election systems are well known and have been\n\nextensively identified. Several years ago, Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir herself convened\n\na Travis County Clerk Election Study Group to evaluate Travis County's current voting system\n\nand             make             recommendation s            for           future             systems.\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontent/images/presentations_ articles/pdCtc _elections _E\n\nSG_Report_2009. pdf)        Clerk DeBeauvoir had determined that a study group was needed to\n\naddress public concerns about electronic voting and to ensure ample time to plan for an upgrade or\n\nreplacement of the existing system and \"its most significant recommendation is that Travis County\n\nmove away from an all-electronic voting system to one that offers electronically-counted paper\n\nballots.\" Clerk DeBeauvoir is on record stating the need to redesign and replace Travis County's\n\nvoting                                                                                        systems:\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontent/images/presentations articles/pdf tc elections 2\n\n013.07.26 star.pdf and https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files12013/09/Dana-Debeauvoir-STAR-\n\nVoting-System-Diagram.pdf and \"Three years ago, DeBeauvoir decided that something had to\n\nchange. \"1 said, 'Okay, I'm fed up. I'm going to design my own system.'\" Part of her frustration\n\nstemmed from complaints lodged against the county that she felt blamed officials for things\n\nbeyond      their   control.\"(   https://www.texastribune.org120 14/07/09/travis-county-forges-new-\n\nterritory-voting-machines/):\n\n94.       Given the specific voting irregularities outlined herein, Dr. Laura Pressley fully supports\n\nthe Clerk's search for a more accountable and election system.      One critical component that the\n\nTravis County system is lacking is that Texas Election Code allows for a manual recount using\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.32\n                                                                                                         1569\n\f\"images of ballots cast.\" When Pressley requested a manual recount using \"images of ballots cast\"\n\nfor the District 4 Run Off election, Travis County is on record stating they cannot comply.\n\nInterestingly, in January 20] 5, Pressley was informed both by DeBeauvoir and fonner Travis\n\nCounty Judge Bill Aleshire that no other candidate in Travis County's history had requested a\n\nmanual recount of \"images of ballots cast.\" A review of reported cases shows no indication that\n\nany candidate in the state has requested such a statutorily-allowed recount. This contest, therefore,\n\nto the extent it decides issues regarding this mandate and this language, is a case of first\n.       .     25\nImpressIOn.\n\n\n\n The court will, of course, be guided by the Texas Supreme Court's view of statutory language,\n25\nwhich is not as fluid as that of federal courts or other state courts.\n\n       If the statutory text is unambiguous, a court must adopt the interpretation supported\n       by the statute's plain language unless that interpretation would lead to absurd results.\n       See Tune v. Tex. Dep't ofPub. Safety, 23 S.W.3d 358,363 (Tex.2000) (\"We must\n       enforce the plain meaning of an unambiguous statute.\"); RepublicBank Dallas, NA.\n       v.

With regard to the fact that Travis Count's use of one version of the Hart InterCivic\n\neSlate system may violate the Texas Election Code requirements for storing, retrieving, and\n\nprinting of \"images of ballots cast,\" we respectfully assert any regulatory redefinition equating\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" with \"cast vote records\" exceeds the statutory grant of authority?6 Given\n\nthat the term \"ballot\" is defined in the Texas Election Code and \"images of ballots cast\" is\n\nreferenced with regard to recounts and \"cast vote records\" are not, the Texas Election Code trumps\n\nthe Secretary of State's administrative definitions.\n\n96.      Addressing the various pieces of evidence that became available and the irregularities that\n\noccurred during the recount is important in the analysis and evaluation of this election contest.\n\nThe recount evidence is critically material to this case and the allegations are legally relevant to\n\nthis election contest. Moreover, it is in the recount failures that Travis County's failure to use\n\nequipment up to statutory standards becomes clear.\n\n97.          The legal question raised by an election contest is whether the outcome of the\n\ncontested District 4 election is not, or cannot be conclusively detennined to be, the true outcome.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Pressley has found that illegal votes were counted, Travis County Elections\n\nDivision prevented eligible voters from voting, failed to count legal votes, and engaged in other\n\nirregularities that materially affected the election results. Moreover, because of the failure of\n\nTravis County to maintain \"images of ballots cast\", the outcome cannot be detennined to be the\n\n         Faced with clear statutory language, \"the judge's inquiry is at an end.\" It may be a\n         widespread practice to mine the minutiae of legislative records to discern what\n         lawmakers had in mind, but as we have held, relying on these materials is verboten\n         where the statutory text is, as here, absolutely clear.\n26 We cannot construe the rule in a manner that is inconsistent with the statute.

Contestee Casar's      ORIGINAL ANSWER AND                 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS             TO\n\nCONTESTANT'S ORIGINAL CONTEST OF ELECTION references the Andrade v. NAACP\n\ncase, seeks to apply it to the instant case, and states that \"the Secretary of State's certification of\n\neSlate for use by Travis County did not violate equal protection rights of voters using electronic\n\nvoting system.\"\n\n99.        Contestee Casar misinterprets Contestant Dr. Pressley's claims in this case. She does not\n\nassert a claim of violation of equal protection as it relates to electronic voting systems. Rather,\n\nContestant Dr. Pressley asserts that illegal votes were counted, election officers prevented eligible\n\nvoters from voting, election officers failed to count legal votes, and election officers made mistakes\n\nthat resulted in an election outcome which is not the true outcome and did not preserve images of\n\nballots to be used as acheck on the computer results which prevented a detemlination that the election\n\nand the recount was a true outcome. Thus, the Andrade case is irrelevant.\n\n100.     Contestee Dr. Pressley's election contest claims were not asserted in Andrade v. NAACP\n\nand Dr. Pressley has been directly harmed by Travis County's conduct during the District 4\n\nelection and she has been directly harmed by the County's inability to ascertain the true outcome\n\nbecause \"ballots,\" \"original ballots\" and/or \"images of ballots cast\" cannot be counted.\n\n            Tex.

Contestee Casar misinterprets Contestant Dr. Pressley's claims in this case. She does not\n\nassert claims of violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as\n\nit relates to electronic voting systems.    Rather, Contestant Dr. Pressley asserts, illegal votes were\n\ncounted, election officers prevented eligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal\n\nvotes, and election officers made mistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true\n\noutcome and they did not preserve the images of ballots which is a possible function of the eSlate\n\nprogram.\n\n103.       Additionally, as a matter of law, Dr. Pressley claims that \"cast vote records\" do not meet the\n\nstatutory requirements of \"ballots,\" \"original ballots\" and/or \"images of ballots cast.\" Therefore, if\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" were not preserved, and thus cannot be retrieved, printed and counted,\n\nthen Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\n\n\nPressley v.

Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Contestant requests the run-off election be\n\ndeclared void, a new run-off be held at which images of the ballots actually cast be preserved\n\nusing procedures compliant with the Texas Election Code for use in the event of a contest, the\n\nCourt award reimbursement for the cost of her election contest, recount fees, and that the Court\n\ngrant all other and further relief, in law and in equity, to which she may be entitled.\n\n                                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               David Rogers\n                                               LA W OFFICE OF DAVlD ROGERS\n\n\n\n                                       By:       /s/ David Rogers\n                                               David A.

BACKGROUND\n\n1. Contestant requests this honorable Court to compel the Clerk of Travis County, Texas to\n\nprovide documents responsive to her Second Request for Production of Documents to Travis\n\nCounty Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir submitted on May 14, 2015.          Also, Contestant request this\n\nhonorable Court to compel the Clerk of Travis County, Texas to respond appropriately to\n\ndeposition requests that have been made by Contestant. The Clerk has recently filed a Motion for\n\nProtective Order claiming Contestant is conducting discovery which is outside the Court's Order\n\non Third Party Discovery Plan. This is not an accurate representation. The Travis County Clerk\n\nhas made erroneous objections, or asserted privileges which do not comply with Texas Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 193. Contestant's Second Request for Production ofDocuments submitted to the\n\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.l\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   4 0\n\fTravis County Clerk is relevant to the subject matter of her pending action and are directly\n\nrelated to new information disclosed in the Clerk's discovery response and Contestant would be\n\nunfairly prejudiced without such additional discovery.\n\n                             II.    ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n2. The Travis County Clerk continues to make overly broad statements and objections to\n\nContestant's production requests. The Clerk has not provided a good faith factual and legal basis\n\nfor the objections. Instead the Clerk's objections are broad, non-specific, and do not identify\n\nwhich of the 29 individual requests are problematic and why.\n\n3. According to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 192.3, it is not a ground for objection that the\n\ninformation sought will be inadmissible at trial if the information appears to be reasonably\n\ncalculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence. All of Contestant's requests will be\n\nadmissible and/or is expected to lead to admissible information.\n\n4. Contrary to the Clerk's assertion, Contestant is not seeking discovery that is contrary to the\n\nCourt's rulings. Contestant's Second Request for Production of Documents, submitted to the\n\nTravis County Clerk, is relevant to the subject matter of her pending action and are directly\n\nrelated to new information disclosed in the Clerk's discovery response and deposition.\n\nFurthermore, Contestant would be unfairly prejudiced without such additional discovery.\n\n5. If the Clerk believes a request violates the Court's ruling, the Clerk should be specific as to\n\nwhich requests from Contestant's Second Request for Production of Documents are in violation\n\nof the Third Party Discovery Control Plan.        At this time, the Clerk has only make broad\n\ngeneralities and no specific details of her allegations have been presented.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4 07\n\f6. If the Court desires, Contestant is more than amendable to providing details for the various\n\nproduction request to explain the importance of each item and describe how the requests will\n\neither be admissible evidence at trial or lead to admissible evidence. However, this has been\n\nmade clear in the response to summary judgment and the motion to compel already on file.\n\n7. In addition, in light of the recent discovery responses and the Clerk's deposition, new\n\npleadings have been filed in Contestant's 6th Amended Petition 1 . Contestant's Second Request\n\nfor Production of Documents 2 reflect, and are directly related to, new information disclosed in\n\nClerk's recent discovery response and Contestant would be unfairly prejudiced without such\n\nadditional discovery.\n\n8. In fact, this Court stated to Contestant's Council, Mr. Rogers, \"If you can provide the Court\n\nwith some evidence as to some -- one of these mistakes that you can identify, I'll have them\n\nsearch for those particular issues .... \"(Transcript from Special Hearing, April 6, 2015, pp. 124-\n\n5). See below for examples of such mistakes that warrant further discovery requests.\n\n9. The Clerk's discovery responses and her subsequent deposition have validated that numerous\n\nmistakes were made during the tabulation of votes on the night of the Runoff election. 3 ' 4 Many\n\nvote corruption mistakes (Exhibit C, pages 5, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29 and 42), as evidenced in the Hart\n\nVoting System security audit logs errors, \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB [Mobile Ballot Box-where\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Exhibit A, Contestant's 61h Amended Petition.\n2\n  Exhibit B, 2nd Request for Production for Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir\n3\n  Exhibit C, Tally system security audit logs\n4\n  Exhibit D, Deposition of Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.3\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4 08\n\fvotes are stored].\" Regarding these errors, the Clerk said, , \"I've never heard of so many.\" 5\n\n(Exhibit D, Page 98 lines 16-25)\n\n10. Contestant has made additional production requests based on the reasonable calculation that\n\nthe new information related to corrupt memory cards, corrupt hardware, preventive maintenance\n\nof hardware, corrective action logs, those with access to corrupt memory cards, manuals,\n\nspecifications, backup hardware, software, parallel testing, etc. will be admissible at trial or will\n\nlead to admissible information at trial so the Court can determine if the true outcome of the\n\nelection can be known\n\n11. In addition, discovery documents specifically state ballot images in the form of an image file\n\n(.bmp) and cast vote records are stored on the Hart Voting System6 (Exhibit E, page 24 and 259-\n\n260) and thus Contestant has made specific requests related to ballot images stored on the\n\nequipment.\n\n12. The Clerk further misrepresents the facts in this case with respect to the manual recount.\n\nThe manual recount was conducted in violation of the Texas Election Code, in that ballot images\n\nwere not used to recount votes, A cast vote record is not an image ofballots cast because it is not\n\na ballot, or an image.\n\n13. Also, in the Motion for Protective Order, the Clerk misrepresents that documents have been\n\nprovided to Contestant that \"verify the outcome of the election\":\n\n\n\n\n5\n    Exhibit D, Dana Deposition, MBB references.\n6\n    Exhibit E, Hart Voting System Ballot Now Operations Manual\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        4 0\n\f           a. Polling place sign in sheets-These do not verify the votes cast by voters, do not\n\n              meet requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and\n\n              therefore, do not verity the election outcome.\n\n           b. Audit logs- These do not verity the votes cast by voters, do not meet\n\n              requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and therefore,\n\n              do not verity the election outcome. In addition, the audit logs have been found to\n\n              have missing entries and thus are not credible.\n\n           c. Serial numbers of equipment- These do not verify the votes cast by voters, do\n\n              not meet requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and\n\n              therefore, do not verity the election outcome.\n\n           d. List of Early Votes names- These do not verity the votes cast by voters, do not\n\n              meet requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and\n\n              therefore, do not verify the election outcome. In addition, compared to Early\n\n              Voting lists provided in December to Contestant, it appears many voters names\n\n              have been removed and thus is not a credible list.\n\n           e. Canvass Reports- These do not verify the votes cast by voters, do not meet\n\n              requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and therefore,\n\n              do not verify the election outcome..     These lists are produced from the same\n\n              system that was subject to the \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB\" errors and thus are\n\n              unreliable.\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.5\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   4 10\n\f               f.   Zero Tapes-These do not verity the votes cast by voters, do not meet\n\n                    requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and therefore,\n\n                    do not verify the election outcome. In addition, discovery documents provided by\n\n                    Travis County show no \"Zero Tapes\" that meet the Texas Secretary of State's\n\n                    definition were printed and retained for the Runoff and thus were not provided to\n\n                    Contestant.\n\n\n\n14. To be clear, documents have not been provided to Contestant that meet Texas Election Code\n\nto verity the voters' intent in the District 4 Runoff election and thus do not verify the outcome of\n\nthe election.\n\n15. Furthermore, the Clerk misrepresents the intent of the Court's Discovery Control Plan Order7\n\nparagraph 8 whose subject matter specifically refers to communication documents and\n\nContestant's Second Request for Production do not ask for any communication related\n\ndocuments:\n\n               a. \" ... emails, memos, correspondence, or text messages regarding communications\n\n                    regarding the election without specificity as to the email and basis ... \"\n\n               b.    \" ... communications (including reports, emails, memo, correspondence, text\n\n                    messages, IM's, video conferencing or power points) regarding the election ... \"\n\n\n\n\n7\n    Exhibit F, Court's Discovery Plan Order\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         4 11\n\f16. It is unreasonable for the Clerk to claim immunity from further discovery requests since the\n\nelection records of the Runoff are statutorily held by the Travis County Clerk's office.\n\nAdditional discovery requests are needed to ascertain if the true outcome can be determined.\n\n17. Also, for the Clerk to continue to make statements that Contestant's case is a \"frivolous\n\ncontest\" is highly disingenuous and inappropriate given the numerous election irregularities and\n\npossible criminal violations that have caused statutorily required election records to be missing\n\nand/or deleted. Because of the missing election records, the true outcome of the Runoff cannot\n\nbe known and Contestant will continue to make requests for documents and depositions that will\n\nbe admissible in trial or lead to admissible information for trial.\n\n18. It is not been proven by the Travis County's Clerk's office that the Hart Voting System does\n\nnot have the capability to produce \"images of ballots cast\" per the Texas Election Code. Based\n\non Hart Manuals, and Hart patents, the equipment has the capability to store and use ballot\n\nimage files in the form of a bitmap (.bmp ). Contestant asserts that Travis County may not\n\nunderstand how their equipment stores or retrieves ballot images:\n\n               a. Firstly, the Ballot Now manual 8 provided to Contestant clearly documents the\n\n                   system saves \"ballot images\" in the form of a bitmap (.bmp format) file and in\n\n                   addition, it stores cast vote records (data structure format) to transfer data to Tally\n\n                   system. In the Clerk's deposition, she stated, the Ballot Now does not store ballot\n\n                   images. This is clearly a misinformed statement.\n\n\n\n\n8\n    Exhibit E, Hart's Ballot Now Operations Manual (page 24 and 259-260)\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.7\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             4 12\n\f               b. Secondly, in Contestant's First Request for Production, all Cast Vote Records\n\n                   were requested and we know they have not been produced. It has been repeatedly\n\n                   stated by the Clerk's counsel, Mr. Williams, that they have produced all cast vote\n\n                   records. This is clearly a misinformed statement given the Ballot Now manual9\n\n                   clearly states Cast Vote Records are stored and used to transfer Absentee/Mail in\n\n                   Ballot voter data, and\n\n               c. Thirdly, in Contestant's First Request for Production, all Ballot Images were\n\n                   requested and we know they have not been produced. It has been repeatedly\n\n                   stated by the Clerk's counsel, Mr. Williams, that they cannot produce any ballot\n\n                   1mages.     This is a misinformed statement given Travis County's Ballot Now\n\n                   Operations manual clearly states ballot images in the form of a bitmap file (.bmp)\n\n                   are stored and can be retrieved. 10\n\nThus, given these three examples of Travis County not being aware of the full capabilities of the\n\nHart system as they relate to cast vote records and ballot images, Contestant seeks information to\n\nprove or disprove ballot images remain on the eSlate, JBC, and the Mobile Ballot Boxes\n\n(MBB' s) for the Runoff.\n\n19. Contestant understands and is sensitive to proprietary concerns given she holds four U.S.\n\npatents herself and because of her extensive background in the technology industry here in\n\nAustin. With that in mind, Contestant is amenable to gaining access to documents under a\n\n\n\n9\n     Exhibit E, Hart's Ballot Now Operations Manual (page 24 and 259-260)\n10\n     Exhibit E, Hart's Ballot Now Operations Manual (page 24 and 259-260)\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.8\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        4 13\n\fprotective order or in camera inspection. The intent of the discovery requests are to determine if\n\nthe true outcome of the election can be known.\n\n20. Oral deposition of those Travis County employees and/or contractors that have information\n\nregarding security database error codes or security protocols that occurred during the Runoff\n\ngiven the security breaches, missing audit log entries, corrupt error codes, duplicate vote entries,\n\nthat occurred with the tabulation of votes is critical and is reasonably calculated to lead to\n\nadmissible information.       In addition, in her deposition, the Travis County Clerk agreed to\n\nprovide names of such individuals. 11\n\n21. The needs and circumstances of this election contest warrant the above referenced Second\n\nRequest for Production and deposition of Travis County employee( s) that have knowledge of the\n\ndetails of the Runoff election as it relates to the error codes and entries documented in the audit\n\nlogs.\n\n                                                                    Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                   David Rogers\n                                                   LAW OFFICE OF DAVID ROGERS\n\n\n\n                                           By:       Is/ David Rogers\n                                                   David A.

Rogers Misstates the Standard for Chapter 10 Sanctions\n\n       Contestee Casar seeks relief under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode. He does not seek sanctions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13, and Rogers'\n\nResponse confuses the two standards. Contestee's burden is not, as Rogers asserts, to prove that\n\nthe Contestant's pleadings were \"groundless,\" or brought for an \"improper purpose.\" See Reply\n\nat   5-7. This is the standard under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13. A different test applies\n\nunder Chapter 10 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code, the authority under which Contestee\n\nseeks sanctions.\n\n       Under § 10.001, the signer of a pleading or motion certifies that \"each claim, each\n\nallegation, and each denial is based on the signatory's best knowledge, information, and\n\nbelief, formed after reasonable inquiry.\" Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex.\n\n2007)(emphasis in original) (upholding sanctions under CPRC Chapter 10 against an attorney\n\nwho plead that two doctors provided or prescribed a certain drug to the plaintiff, in spite of\n\n                                               1\n\n                                                                                                   2020\n\finformation to the contrary in the plaintiff's medical records which the attorney possessed); see\n\nalso Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code 10.001(2)-(3) (referring to \"each claim\" and \"each\n\nallegation\"). Casar is not required to show bad faith or malicious intent by Rogers. He must only\n\nshow that Rogers certified he made a reasonable inquiry into all of the allegations when he did\n\nnot and that he certified that all the allegations in the petition had evidentiary support when some\n\nallegations did not. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 617. A reasonable inquiry is that amount of examination\n\nthat is reasonable under the circumstances of the case. Softech Int'l, Inc. v.

Bail Bond Bd., 233 S.W.3d 57, 63\n\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 2007, no pet.)).\n\n       The relevant portions of Section 10.001 state that:\n\n               \"The signing of a pleading or motion as required by the Texas\n               Rules of Civil Procedure constitutes a certificate by the signatory\n               that to the signatory's best knowledge, information, and belief,\n               formed after reasonable inquiry:\n\n               . . .

Section 10.001(2) applies only to counsel, Mr. Rogers, and § 10.001(3) applies to\n\nboth Ms. Pressley and Mr. Rogers.\n\n\n       II.     Rogers Failed to Make a Reasonable Inquiry into the Claims and Legal\n               Contentions Asserted under 10.001(2)\n\n\n       Rogers repeatedly, throughout six separate Contests, made the legal contention that a\n\n\"ballot image\" differs from a \"cast vote record.\" See Original Contest at    32-38; Second\n\nAmended Contest at      31-37; Third Amended Contest at       43-53; Fourth Amended Contest at\n\n   43-53; Fifth Amended Contest at      49-59; Sixth Amended Contest at       3, 13,82,84,97-\n\n138. In his reply, he attempts to justify these contentions by claiming that he reasonably relied on\n\nseveral sources. See Rogers' Response at       As an initial matter, Rogers did not cite most these\n\nsupposed legal sources until the Sixth Amended Contest and therefore could not have relied on\n\nthem for the first five Contests he filed. Furthermore, a close examination of these sources\n\nreveals that Rogers failed to make a reasonably inquiry into his claim that a Ballot Image differs\n\nfrom a Cast Vote Record.\n\n       Simply put, Rogers' inquiry was not reasonable. He ignored an abundance of controlling\n\nand persuasive legal authority from the Texas Secretary of State, Election Assistance\n\nCommission, and Travis County, which define ballot image and cast vote record as synonymous.\n\nSee, e.g., Contestee's Motion/or Summary Judgment at Ex. 15, U.S. Election Assistance\n\nCommission Glossary of Key Election Terminology (2007) at 10; Ex. 16, Memo from Keith\n\nIngram, Electronic Voting System Procedures, (April 1,2014). He also ignored the letters that\n\nthe Secretary of State's Election Administrator sent to Ms. Pressley, before suit was filed,\n\nexpressly stating that the Travis County Clerk had printed ballot images. See Contestee's\n\n\n                                                 3\n\n                                                                                                       2022\n\fAmended Motion for Summary Judgment, Ex. 6, Letter from Texas Secretary of State Director\n\nof Elections Keith Ingram to Pressley (Jan. 20,2015); Ex. 7, Letter from Texas Secretary of State\n\nDirector of Elections Keith Ingram to Pressley (Jan. 27,2015).\n\n        Instead, he pieced together unrelated and outdated excerpts from the Election Code, the\n\nTexas Constitution, and various other sources. See Rogers' Response at        The chart below\n\nanalyzes the evidence upon which Rogers claims he relies, and the reasons why his reliance on\n\nthese authorities is unreasonable.\n\n                 Source                             Reliance is Unreasonable Because ...\n\nTex. Elec. Code § 124.063;                  These authorities do not state that a cast vote record\nTexas Election Code § 12S.001(a)            differs from a ballot image. Moreover, Rogers'\nTexas Election Code Chapter 52; Texas       citation to these sections is selective and he ignores\nConstitution Article 6, Sec. 4              other, clearly applicable authority to the contrary.\n                                            For example, Texas Election Code § 52.075 gives\n                                            the Secretary of State authority to prescribe the form\n                                            and content of ballots for electronic voting machine.\n                                            Similarly, § 129.002 of the Election Code gives the\n    i\n    ,\n                                            Secretary of State the authority to implement Direct\n                                            Recording Electronic voting systems, like the Hart\n                                            Intercivic System, that utilize Cast Vote Records.\n\n1990 Federal Election Commission            Rogers did not cite these supposed legal sources\nPerformance and Test Standards              until the Sixth Contest.\n\n                                            The 1990 report is outdated and was superseded by a\n                                            2002 report from the FEC. Rogers failed to consider\n                                            the more recent definition from the FEC, which does\n                                            define a ballot image in a way that includes a CVR.\n                                            See Contestant's Response to Summary Judgment at\n                                            Ex.

And that is a proofing audit that's done before\n24    Q. -- and then --                                       24   the results are t·eleased.\n25    A. -- a locked bag, along with all of the               25            Then we also do after-election-night\n\n                                                   Page 78                                                          Page 80\n\n  I paperwork.                                                 1   audits, priot· to the canvass, where we go back and we\n 2    Q. And then that's what's -- on -- the information       2   confit·m every detail we can find. Many of these details\n 3 on that computer chip --                                    3   that we've just talked about, about them, you know--\n 4    A. Uh-huh.                                               4   there are-- I mean, it's about-- elections are about\n 5    Q. --is what your office uses to figure out who          5   human beings.

First step is the seals. I mentioned the list         9   doesn't really have any boundaries, per se. We check\n10 of seals. The first step is, the seals get checked.        10   whatever we need to check. Then when the canvass is\nII At·e we sure we have all of the ballot boxes? Is thue      11   pt·epat·ed, that's the final. That's the official\n12 two in this particulat· precinct, or is it just one? Are   12   results.\n13 there any special exceptions that we need to think         13             Does that-- does that help you?\n14 about? Do the number of names on the sign-up sheet         14      Q. So ifl -- ifl voted for Ms. Pressley but it\n15 match the number of ballots on the card?                   15   recorded -- but the computer said I voted for Mr. Casar,\n16          And are there any othet· checks that we go        16   how are you going to find that out?\n17 through?                                                   17      A. Well-- all right. That gets back to the\n18          Any affidavits, with anything special we          18   things that we wet·e going to talk about earliet·. There\n19 need to consider, like was thue an emugency situation,     19   at·e three diffet·ent tests that we perform, that would--\n20 whue they have paper ballots that we have to take into     20   that would catch that prior 01\" during voting. The first\n21 consideration? Anything else. All of that is               21   test that's going to-- and so let me tell you what the\n22 double-checked.                                            22   tht·ee tests are.\n23          Then once we are clear of what-- what             23      Q Okay.\n24 picture we have, then the ballot card, the-- there's a     24      A.

And it\n 5   if you use those tests.                                        5 doesn't know it's beent·andomly picked out of what's\n 6            Hash code testing says you are using the              6 been sent to the field.\n 7   software that is pi\"Opel\"ly certified to be used in your       7           So all day long, it's voted; and it's,\n 8   state for that particular system and that there is             8 typically, staff. It's kind of a fun thing. People go\n 9   nothing else resident on that software. No. 1.                 9 in with a list of candidates they't·e supposed to vote.\nI0            No. 2, logic and accuracy testing,                   10 It's double-checked so that we make sure we don't have\nII   especially if you do it by hand with as much permutation      II human errot·, which was our number-- it is our No. I\n12   and volume as you can possibly manage, tells you the          12 problem. And then at the end of the day, we go in and\n13   general mistakes that could get made, befm·e every            13 compat·e the known data of entry to what that system\n14   election. A lot of jul\"isdictions don't take it L & A         14 actually produces back out when you ask for a report\n15   seriously. We take it extraordinarily seriously.              15 from it. And you can tell if anything-- a Trojan\n16            It will tell you that you have every                 16 horse, a something ot· other that was going to cause\n17   candidate in the proper precinct; that you don't have         17 something to flip -- you can tell if that had happened\n18   them in the wrong precinct; that every race has all the       18 or, you know, was-- if there is any record of that.

But in-- on that Sunday, we\n 4             MS. THOMAS: -- question, then.                  4 did have a bright idea that-- we figured out a way to\n 5             MR. COHEN: I did.

And so on Sunday, we\n 8             MS. THOMAS: I did not.                          8   went tht·ough and we printed out bet· cast vote records\n 9             MR.

We are here with various motions.        We have\n\n 5   summary judgment motions.     We have motions for sanctions.\n\n 6   We have motions to strike pleadings.         We have motions to,\n\n 7   basically, enforce a Rule 11 agreement regrading\n\n 8   discovery costs unless that was resolved by Travis County\n\n 9   and Ms. Pressley's side of the lawsuit.\n\n10                  Anything that I missed?        Mr. Herring is\n\n11   here on behalf of Mr. Casar and Mr. Cohen is here on\n\n12   behalf Dr. Pressley.\n\n13                  MR. HERRING:     Thank you.     You have\n\n14   everything we have.\n\n15                  MR. COHEN:     There's a Motion to Compel\n\n16   Discovery.\n\n17                  THE COURT:     Right.   I have -- I have --\n\n18                  MR. COHEN:     Okay.    You didn't mention it.\n\n19   So I just want to make sure.     They have a protective\n\n20   order with respect to their motion, the County does.           So\n\n21   that's all joined on what you're going to do.         Both\n\n22   parties have briefed it pretty well.         You're just going\n\n23   to have to make a decision.\n\n24                  THE COURT:     Are you ready to proceed on the\n\n25   County's motion?\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                    5\n 1                  MR. COHEN:    Summary judgment?\n\n 2                  THE COURT:    For the payment of the money.\n\n 3                  MS. THOMAS:    Judge, counsel did forward a\n\n 4   check on Friday.   We just need them to make sure it's\n\n 5   written to the right person.     Also, we would like the\n\n 6   Court to entertain the attorneys fees, because it did\n\n 7   require filing of a motion before they were willing to\n\n 8   pay.\n\n 9                  THE COURT:    You asked for, like, $250\n\n10   attorneys fees, something like that?\n\n11                  MS. THOMAS:    I believe that is correct,\n\n12   Your Honor.\n\n13                  MR. COHEN:    Your Honor, we have a dispute\n\n14   about whether they were charging too much.       Rather than\n\n15   bring that to you, we eventually decided, well, it's a\n\n16   $500 difference, but it was a legitimate dispute.       They\n\n17   didn't give us any backup to the invoice.     They just sent\n\n18   an invoice.   The people that were there -- I can't speak\n\n19   to that.   I wasn't at the actual production session, but\n\n20   I'm told they were making copies with their own people\n\n21   and their own copies and charging us; just rinky dink\n\n22   stuff as far as I'm concerned.\n\n23                  THE COURT:    When I read the motion,\n\n24   counsel, as you -- you've probably practiced a long time,\n\n25   as I have and Mr. Herring has.    You well know -- all of\n                         LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                            (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                  6\n 1   you well know, judges don't like to get involved in those\n\n 2   kind of things, especially when you start reading, Did\n\n 3   they take a lunch break?    And, you know, the Court tried\n\n 4   to accommodate your client's side by reducing the costs,\n\n 5   and the County did, too.    And then to see a discovery\n\n 6   dispute come up about payment of fees and copiers and,\n\n 7   you know, pointing fingers --\n\n 8                 MR. COHEN:    It was a legitimate dispute.\n\n 9   We decided -- I decided, frankly, that it was not worth\n\n10   -- we shouldn't waste the Court's time on that today; and\n\n11   that if there's a dispute, it's over $500.      There's a lot\n\n12   more money being spent in this case than $500.\n\n13                 THE COURT:    So you want $250 in attorneys\n\n14   fees?\n\n15                 MS. THOMAS:    Yes, Your Honor.\n\n16                 MR. COHEN:    I just don't think there's any\n\n17   reason to warrant attorneys fees.    There's no attorneys\n\n18   fees -- there's no provision in the law for you to award\n\n19   attorneys fees and there's no -- you know, as you well\n\n20   know, in order to award attorneys fees, there has to be\n\n21   some sanctionable conduct, and disputing and debating the\n\n22   amount of the bill is not something that you would\n\n23   normally award attorneys fees for.\n\n24                 MS. THOMAS:    Your Honor, there was a series\n\n25   of exchanges with counsel on whether or not it was\n                        LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                           (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                       7\n 1   appropriate to pay that amount.    As you know, we went\n\n 2   above and beyond by not only even accommodating their\n\n 3   request to bring in their own printer.      So the fight --\n\n 4   it required us to file a motion.    That's all that we're\n\n 5   asking for is the time spent to require them to pay,\n\n 6   which didn't have to happen.    And it's the same type of\n\n 7   discovery issues we're seeing over and over with\n\n 8   Ms. Pressley.    So we ask that to deter the behavior in\n\n 9   the future.\n\n10                   THE COURT:   Sherine Thomas.   I'm sorry.     I\n\n11   didn't call your name since you were a party.      Ms. Thomas\n\n12   with the County Attorney representing the County Clerk.\n\n13                   My inclination is to award the attorneys\n\n14   fees because the motion got filed and it wasn't resolved.\n\n15   So I don't think $250 is an extremely large amount of\n\n16   money for the filing of that pleading, and I had to spend\n\n17   the time reading it, too.\n\n18                   MR. COHEN:   I understand, Your Honor, and\n\n19   there was a dispute.    There was a legitimate dispute.       It\n\n20   wasn't some frivolous thing.    There was a legitimate\n\n21   dispute about what we were paying for.      They did not give\n\n22   us a detailed accounting for where they got to that\n\n23   number.    And so we had a little discussion internally and\n\n24   decided that it wasn't worth fighting about, and so we\n\n25   paid it.\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                      8\n 1                    So what I'm saying is, there was -- they\n\n 2   didn't provide us with a backup to show that their bill\n\n 3   was legitimate and for us to say, Well, now, we saw it\n\n 4   this way.    How did you see it?    And the response was to\n\n 5   file a motion.    So they elected to file a motion that\n\n 6   they really didn't have to file until we worked it out,\n\n 7   and I shouldn't -- my client shouldn't have to pay their\n\n 8   attorneys fees for doing that.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:    What do you say?\n\n10                    MS. THOMAS:    Your Honor, we did lay it out\n\n11   for them; and, in fact, they were present.        The question\n\n12   of lunch hours and things -- they were present during,\n\n13   and they know that our clients were working throughout\n\n14   the day.    So that doesn't seem like a fair thing.\n\n15                    THE COURT:    You say they were present?\n\n16   You're talking about Ms. Pressley?\n\n17                    MS. THOMAS:   And her counsel.\n\n18                    THE COURT:    And the lawyer, Mr. Rogers, was\n\n19   there?\n\n20                    MS. THOMAS:   Mr. Rogers was there.     In\n\n21   addition, Your Honor, when the check was delivered, it\n\n22   had a cover letter saying that they're giving us the\n\n23   check in the amount under protest.      And so that means\n\n24   that this is still live in their minds, because that's\n\n25   what they asserted to us.      And we ask the Court to\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                       9\n 1   resolve the issue today so we don't have to be back here.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:    Mr. Rogers just appeared.\n\n 3                   Mr. Rogers, you heard Ms. Thomas say you\n\n 4   were present during the discovery when this issue of who\n\n 5   was out for lunch and who was eating sandwiches and who\n\n 6   had slow copiers and all the other things that were an\n\n 7   allegation.    Do you read those pleadings to be accurate?\n\n 8                   MR. ROGERS:    No, Your Honor, I don't.     And\n\n 9   while I was there for the whole time, one of the things\n\n10   that I can tell the Court was that, for a great deal of\n\n11   the time, the employees of the County Clerk's office left\n\n12   the area where we had our copier set up and went and made\n\n13   copies for the County Clerk's records on their own time\n\n14   and left the copiers alone.      We did get somebody in there\n\n15   when somebody was leaving for a whole hour for lunch.\n\n16                   The clerk's office was kind enough to bring\n\n17   a substitute in there, but I would say somewhere between\n\n18   a third and a half of the time that we were there, the\n\n19   County Clerk's employees were making copies for the\n\n20   County Clerk's records.      Their copies -- they gave us\n\n21   originals.    We made copies and then they made copies of\n\n22   our copies for their records.      I don't think my client\n\n23   should be charged for their making copies for their\n\n24   records, and that was a considerable amount of the time\n\n25   that was involved, Your Honor.\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                    10\n 1                    THE COURT:    Well, it doesn't sound -- a\n\n 2   check has been tendered, Mr. Cohen said.         Sounds like\n\n 3   maybe we ought to have a hearing and decide what really\n\n 4   went on if there's a really legitimate contest.         And then\n\n 5   if I find bad behavior, then I'll sanction somebody for\n\n 6   it.   So you-all can decide what we're going to do.        I\n\n 7   think the attorney's fees should be paid or else we're\n\n 8   going to have a hearing to determine whether sanctions\n\n 9   should be imposed, and I'll hold that in abeyance and\n\n10   you-all can talk about it.\n\n11                    MR. COHEN:    Your Honor, we don't want to\n\n12   have a hearing.    We don't want to fight about the\n\n13   minutia.   The only reason this is relevant is to the\n\n14   issue of attorney's fees and whether our dispute was\n\n15   reasonable and legitimate so that we didn't do anything\n\n16   sanctionable by it with them before they filed a motion.\n\n17   They elected to file a motion while we were discussing\n\n18   these matters.\n\n19                    THE COURT:    It doesn't look like -- they\n\n20   thought or felt compelled to file a motion because\n\n21   apparently they couldn't -- they didn't have any sense\n\n22   that they were going to be resolved.         If what Mr. Rogers\n\n23   is telling the Court, he still has some argument about\n\n24   what actually occurred.       So I'm willing to give you a\n\n25   hearing, and you can bring witnesses and we can spend two\n                           LAURA H.

And if I find bad\n\n 2   behavior, somebody's going to get sanctioned.\n\n 3                   MR. COHEN:    The reason I got paid --\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    You want to pay the attorney's\n\n 5   fees?\n\n 6                   MR. COHEN:    -- was so we didn't have to\n\n 7   have a hearing.    If you order it, I've got to comply with\n\n 8   your order, Your Honor.      I'm just objecting to it.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:    I'm affording you the\n\n10   opportunity to have the hearing.      That's what I'm\n\n11   affording you to do.      Do you want to have the hearing or\n\n12   pay the attorney's fees?\n\n13                   MR. COHEN:    We're going to just pay the\n\n14   attorneys fees.\n\n15                   THE COURT:    So the attorneys fees will get\n\n16   paid.    It's resolved.    That's what we'll do with that.\n\n17                   MS. THOMAS:    Your Honor, I have a draft\n\n18   order.\n\n19                   THE COURT:    Have you seen a copy?     Show him\n\n20   a copy of it.\n\n21                   MS. THOMAS:    It says that the payment has\n\n22   already been received for the $836; that it was\n\n23   appropriate and that there's $250 in attorney's fees.\n\n24                   THE COURT:    This order acceptable to you,\n\n25   Mr. Cohen?\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                     12\n 1                   MR. COHEN:     It's not acceptable to me as\n\n 2   far as the substance, but the form seems to be okay.\n\n 3                   THE COURT:     All right.     Based upon your\n\n 4   agreement, then I'll enter that.       I'll enter that order\n\n 5   is what we'll do.\n\n 6                   All right.     Now, the -- we have -- we have\n\n 7   a Motion to Strike Pleadings which relates -- that's the\n\n 8   -- that's the motion to strike the sixth amended\n\n 9   petition, Mr. --\n\n10                   MR. HERRING:     Judge, the motion was\n\n11   actually filed when they had filed either the fourth or\n\n12   fifth --\n\n13                   THE COURT:     The fifth maybe.\n\n14                   MR. HERRING:     And we have filed, now, the\n\n15   amended motion, and we're not seeking to strike those\n\n16   pleadings.    So that's off the table.      Our amended motion\n\n17   takes that request off.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     We don't have that motion?\n\n19                   MR. HERRING:     No.\n\n20                   THE COURT:     So then probably the next\n\n21   easiest thing to do is deal with the summary judgment\n\n22   motion.    Would counsel agree?\n\n23                   MR. HERRING:     I think --\n\n24                   MR. COHEN:     That's fine, Your Honor.\n\n25                   THE COURT:     Since it's your summary\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                         13\n 1   judgment motion, did you -- did you read all the\n\n 2   pleadings that were filed this morning, Mr. Herring?\n\n 3   There were pleadings sent.      When I turned my phone on\n\n 4   this morning, I had two more things that popped up on my\n\n 5   phone.\n\n 6                   MR. HERRING:     Right.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     When I got here to the\n\n 8   courthouse this morning, one of the clerks was kind\n\n 9   enough to have printed them.      And I read them.        I don't\n\n10   know whether you've read them.\n\n11                   MR. HERRING:     I have glanced at them, and\n\n12   someone here at the table with me has read them.           So I\n\n13   think we're ready to go.\n\n14                   THE COURT:     So you're ready to speak to\n\n15   that?\n\n16                   MR. HERRING:     At least one of those didn't\n\n17   relate to us.   It goes back to the County.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     Right.     It deals with\n\n19   compelling some production, basically.\n\n20                   MR. HERRING:     One of them addressed our\n\n21   Motion to Strike, which we're not seeking to strike.              All\n\n22   we have pending on that front is the request for\n\n23   attorney's fees which would come after the summary\n\n24   judgment motion depending on the Court's ruling.\n\n25                   THE COURT:     I have read all of your\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                  14\n 1   motions.   And I'll show you I've tagged them, as you can\n\n 2   see, with little points.     I read, you know -- I read all\n\n 3   the stuff again this morning.     So let me just say this.\n\n 4   This is my observation.     I'm not as smart as you are\n\n 5   about all these DREs and CVRs and mobile ballot boxes and\n\n 6   all that type of thing.     But it seems to the Court that\n\n 7   Dr. Pressley's lawsuit rises and falls or falls on the\n\n 8   issue of whether CVRs are ballot images; whether that\n\n 9   term CVR can be equated to a ballot image.\n\n10                  I read your expert's report that CVRs are,\n\n11   you know, some kind of data; that the other things are\n\n12   bits.   I've read all your little -- I'm not saying yours,\n\n13   but what you proposed to the Court about all these legal\n\n14   distinctions, computer terminology.     But what I want to\n\n15   ask Mr. Cohen that I don't know -- Mr. Rogers is here.        I\n\n16   don't know who is going to speak for Dr. Pressley.\n\n17                  MR. COHEN:    I will.\n\n18                  THE COURT:    Before we start, do you agree\n\n19   that that seems to be the crux of whether you win or lose\n\n20   this lawsuit, that particular issue?\n\n21                  MR. COHEN:    No, Your Honor.   That is one of\n\n22   the issues.   There's a statute that says that -- there's\n\n23   two statutes involved.     They have to be read to be\n\n24   consistent with each other.     221.012 says that if the\n\n25   tribunal cannot ascertain the outcome of the election,\n                         LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                            (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                  15\n 1   it's supposed to void the election.     And that two point\n\n 2   -- the other one is two point -- 221.003(a), which says\n\n 3   that a Court can void the election based on its findings\n\n 4   of certain things.   And one of them is mistakes.\n\n 5                   So we are contending that there are a lot\n\n 6   of mistakes, and we have fact allegations and fact\n\n 7   evidence, summary-judgment evidence that these mistakes\n\n 8   occurred and that those mistakes are sufficient to\n\n 9   prevent the Court from being able to ascertain the true\n\n10   outcome of the election.     One of those mistakes is the\n\n11   counting CVRs without maintaining images of ballots.\n\n12                   THE COURT:   But that's the bigger issue in\n\n13   terms of, if the Court determines that a CVR is the\n\n14   equivalent of a ballot image, you -- your client has had\n\n15   access to those, counted those, and those documents show\n\n16   what the tally came out where your client was, like, 1291\n\n17   votes behind.   I think it's 1291.\n\n18                   MR. COHEN:   That's correct.   If you\n\n19   determine that a CVR is equal -- is a ballot image, then\n\n20   that takes that off the plate.     If you determine that it\n\n21   isn't, then there's -- there's no way to count votes at\n\n22   all, okay, and you have to redo the election.     That's\n\n23   clear.   But assuming for a minute that you can look at\n\n24   this CVR --\n\n25                   THE COURT:   And I've looked --\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                16\n 1                   MR. COHEN:   That's a ballot.   Assuming you\n\n 2   can do that.    I can't do that, but assuming you can for a\n\n 3   minute --\n\n 4                   THE COURT:   It's more assuming that I think\n\n 5   the law allows that to be viewed that way not what I\n\n 6   particularly believe.     Does the law allow, based upon\n\n 7   what I've read and seen, looked at all your argument --\n\n 8                   MR. COHEN:   We'll talk about that as we go\n\n 9   through the hearing.    To answer your question, if you\n\n10   assume that the -- if you conclude that a CVR is the same\n\n11   as a ballot, either as a matter of law or as a matter of\n\n12   fact, then all that's left in our case is to point out\n\n13   all the mistakes that were made that bring into question\n\n14   whether the outcome is a true outcome or not.\n\n15                   THE COURT:   And those would be the nine\n\n16   errors with the mobile ballot boxes and the periods of\n\n17   time with the closing and opening of these so-called\n\n18   tally sheets.\n\n19                   MR. COHEN:   Yes.\n\n20                   THE COURT:   Is that a fair summation?\n\n21                   MR. COHEN:   There's a few others that I\n\n22   just can't remember off the top of my head.\n\n23                   THE COURT:   You didn't like the closing of\n\n24   certain polling places.\n\n25                   MR. COHEN:   Yeah, that -- I've kind of\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                    17\n 1   given up on that one.\n\n 2                    THE COURT:   I was going to ask you some\n\n 3   more about that, too, in terms of the fact that your\n\n 4   client had notice and didn't protest.        It seems -- you\n\n 5   pointed out there's nothing that says it's a waiver, but\n\n 6   when everybody gets notice that we're going to decide\n\n 7   where to go hold this runoff election -- and you and I\n\n 8   both know the runoffs all produce generally lower votes.\n\n 9   So there's reasons to reduce the number of polling\n\n10   places.     I'm not the one writing this, because somebody\n\n11   else can grade my paper, too, that goes up the road.\n\n12                    MR. COHEN:   I am assuming that we cannot\n\n13   establish that votes were lost because of that.        Okay.\n\n14   So the question -- what I'm getting at is, there's -- I\n\n15   have a list here right now, but not right in front of me.\n\n16                    THE COURT:   But it seems like there's\n\n17   three:     ballot images, CVR, mobile ballot boxes, and\n\n18   whatever errors that produced or didn't produce and those\n\n19   tally sheets being remaining open for periods of time --\n\n20   you know, for a couple of hours without activity, several\n\n21   days without activity.    Those seem to be the more\n\n22   problematic things with -- that's my reading of what you\n\n23   offered.\n\n24                    MR. COHEN:   Those are the most ones.\n\n25   You're right.    You pinpointed the ones that, in my view,\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                      18\n 1   show that the computer was subject to manipulation for\n\n 2   days at a time; that the clerk doesn't even -- has never\n\n 3   seen that many invalid MMBs (sic) and doesn't think that\n\n 4   the reader was working properly.       And so there are some\n\n 5   serious mistakes that were made during the course of\n\n 6   tallying the votes that bring into question whether or\n\n 7   not the computer actually properly tallied the voter's\n\n 8   selection on these ballots.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:   No.    I understand.   That calls\n\n10   into question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\n11                    MR. COHEN:   Yes.\n\n12                    THE COURT:   The tallies and mobile ballot\n\n13   box errors -- I'm not saying the other does.         We got --\n\n14   we have a CVR that no one -- I mean, all I read from your\n\n15   expert -- he doesn't say that ballot image that -- where\n\n16   they finally go vote is not accurately transcribed into a\n\n17   different electronic format when it goes to a Cast Vote\n\n18   Record.   He just doesn't like the format.      He wants the\n\n19   format to be more expansive, have more bits of\n\n20   information.     And I understand the legal distinction that\n\n21   you're making.\n\n22                    MR. COHEN:   Yes.    There's other policy\n\n23   discussions.     We're getting out of step here.      Yeah.\n\n24                    THE COURT:   And I just wanted Mr. Herring\n\n25   to know that before he started with his -- since he's\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                  19\n 1   going to go forward, and you get to respond.\n\n 2                 MR. COHEN:     He's jumping up because he\n\n 3   wants to do his motion for summary judgment.\n\n 4                 MR. HERRING:     I'm actually enjoying it.\n\n 5                 MR. COHEN:     So I will have a more detailed\n\n 6   response.\n\n 7                 THE COURT:     No.    That's fine.   We're close.\n\n 8                 MR. COHEN:     Two things:    One is, there's no\n\n 9   ballots without an image of the ballot.      That's the law.\n\n10   Now, the question is whether a CVR satisfies that or not\n\n11   is a different issue.    But without a ballot -- image of a\n\n12   ballot, there's no votes to count.\n\n13                 THE COURT:     Correct.    Only the absentee --\n\n14                 MR. COHEN:     Yes.\n\n15                 THE COURT:     There was a tie in the absentee\n\n16   ballots.\n\n17                 MR. COHEN:     Or the mail-in.\n\n18                 THE COURT:     Whatever it was.\n\n19                 MR. COHEN:     And the other issue is, there\n\n20   was enough mistakes to bring into question the validity\n\n21   of the tallied counts.   That's it.\n\n22                 THE COURT:     Mr. Cohen, thank you.\n\n23                 Go ahead, Mr. Herring.\n\n24                 MR. HERRING:     May it please the Court.\n\n25   Judge, I think you did a good job in helping save me time\n                        LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                           (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                   20\n 1   in terms of what I need to present by honing in on the\n\n 2   issues.   You've heard most of this before.        Let me\n\n 3   mention -- with the Court's indulgence, I'll have\n\n 4   Ms. Palvino speak after I do on the objection that we\n\n 5   filed to the summary-judgment evidence that they\n\n 6   presented.     Essentially, it focuses on the purported\n\n 7   expert who has zero expertise in election law, but I'll\n\n 8   save that.     She, also, is going to talk about these\n\n 9   supposed errors in the other system.         But I want to focus\n\n10   on the big issues.\n\n11                    Certainly, I want to start with the issue\n\n12   of CVR ballot image, because I think, as Mr. Rogers said\n\n13   during our first hearing -- he said, quote, the big\n\n14   central issue in this lawsuit is whether a CVR is a\n\n15   ballot image.    And he said in that first hearing, quote,\n\n16   if you rule that way, that would obviously put a big hole\n\n17   in our case.\n\n18                    And we think they have a massive hole in\n\n19   their case, Judge, as a result of that.        And let me -- I\n\n20   have a brief packet here from the summary-judgment\n\n21   evidence, if I may approach?\n\n22                    THE COURT:   Yes, sir.   I didn't -- I didn't\n\n23   print all your summary-judgment evidence.         It was just --\n\n24   there were too many pages.     I figured you would -- I'd\n\n25   read your footnotes and see whether it referenced a\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                    21\n 1   deposition or a document, but I did not go read all those\n\n 2   pieces of paper.\n\n 3                   MR. HERRING:     You need to, Judge.\n\n 4                   MR. COHEN:     It's my policy, Your Honor --\n\n 5                   MR. HERRING:     It's right here.\n\n 6                   MR. COHEN:     It's my policy that I just\n\n 7   don't go through all those things with the hearing on the\n\n 8   Motion for Summary Judgment.      I'm assuming that the Court\n\n 9   is very smart enough to read it all and understand it\n\n10   without me regurgitating it.      So it's going to be a short\n\n11   overview of what it says.\n\n12                   THE COURT:     What I was looking for was a\n\n13   basis of the allegation or representations that were\n\n14   made.   In other words, if you say there's some material\n\n15   fact that you want me to consider, then you reference\n\n16   that it's in a deposition or an exhibit list.       And if one\n\n17   side represents it wrong, I assume the other side is\n\n18   going to tell me, Well, Judge, they're not telling you\n\n19   the truth.    So I'm relying on the lawyers to do that\n\n20   rather than me reading it.      Like Mr. Herring has a stack\n\n21   of pages here about three feet high.\n\n22                   MR. COHEN:     We've got several boxes, also,\n\n23   Your Honor.\n\n24                   MR. HERRING:     Three and a half feet, but I\n\n25   left -- I left the Motion for Summary Judgment response\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                        22\n 1   in the boxes because, otherwise, it would fall over.           I\n\n 2   think what their defense is, is obfuscation through\n\n 3   deforestation.\n\n 4                    I think if you look at the real issues, the\n\n 5   overwhelming majority of those documents are completely\n\n 6   irrelevant and immaterial.     So let me get back to the\n\n 7   ballot image.    The evidence in the record, Judge, is\n\n 8   absolutely clear that every level of government says\n\n 9   uniformly, ballot image equals CVR for electronic voting.\n\n10                    The first page in the packet I handed you\n\n11   is from the United States Election Assistance Commission.\n\n12   As you recall, Judge, we've talked about this before.\n\n13   That commission is a bipartisan commission established\n\n14   after the 2002 Help America Vote Act.        It's bipartisan\n\n15   appointed by both parties in Congress through the\n\n16   president.\n\n17                    They have, then -- that commission has 37\n\n18   advisors and it has 110 standards advisors, people\n\n19   throughout the country.    So you have 37 of the foremost\n\n20   experts in election law and procedure and election\n\n21   computerization.    And then you've got 110, the very, very\n\n22   best advisors, two from each state and then others.\n\n23                    For Texas, importantly, the two advisors\n\n24   are Dana DeBeauvoir, the County Clerk who ran this\n\n25   election, who they're attacking, and Keith Ingram, the\n                           LAURA H.

That's\n\n 2   probably the best example is his reliance on Ballot Now.\n\n 3   There are some other examples that I'm happy to get into;\n\n 4   but I think, overall, he's just -- he's not qualified.\n\n 5                 THE COURT:     You're lodging a challenge to\n\n 6   his qualifications to render opinions, basically.\n\n 7                 MS.

Anything else --\n\n11                 MS. PALVINO:     That's all I have.\n\n12                 THE COURT:     -- Mr. Herring?\n\n13                 MR.

Contestee Casar seeks recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, and\n\nother remedies authorized by Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n(\"CPRC\"). On May 19, 2015, Contestant Laura Pressley filed her Sixth Amended Original\n\nContest (\"Sixth Contest\"). As with her previous Contest pleadings, the Sixth Contest contains\n\nclaims, allegations, and contentions that violate CPRC § 10.001(2)-(3). On May 26,2015, this\n\nCourt granted Casar's no-evidence summary judgment motion, which establishes that Pressley\n\nfailed to raise any genuine issue of material fact in response to Casar's motion. Additionally,\n\nduring the May 26 th hearings, counsel for Travis County and for County Clerk DeBeauvoir\n\ninformed the Court that this case has cost Travis County (and therefore the taxpayers of Travis\n\nCounty) well in excess of $40,000. Accordingly, Casar requests that this Court award against\n\nPressley and her counsel who has signed the Contests the recovery of fees, expenses, and other\n\nappropriate remedies provided by §§ 10.002 and 10.004.\n\n                Allegations Concerning Ballot Images and Cast Vote Records\n\n       2.      As first asserted in her Original Contest pleading! and repeated through all six\n\namended Contests, 2 Pressley alleges that Cast Vote Records (CVRs) are not \"images of ballot\n\n\n1 See Original Contest of Election, U 32-38.\n2 See Second Amended Contest, U 31-37; Third Amended Contest, U 43-53; Fourth Amended Contest,\nU 43-53; Fifth Amended Contest, U 49-59,65; and Amended Contest, U 3,13,82,84,97-138.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    1934\n\fcast\" under the Texas Election Code. But Pressley has asserted no legal basis for those\n\nallegations. Instead, she has testified that it \"makes sense to [her] as a layperson, kind of\n\ncommon knowledge, that an image is a picture of a ballot.,,3 Her contention that a Cast Vote\n\nRecord is not a Ballot Image is flatly inconsistent with the definition of that term as adopted and\n\napplied by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the Texas Secretary of State, Travis\n\nCounty, and the City of Austin. All of those governmental entities uniformly define a Cast Vote\n\nRecord as being synonymous with a Ballot Image. Pressley's factual allegations and legal\n\ncontentions to the contrary violate CPRC §§ 10.001(2) and (3).\n\n                                 Allegations Concerning Zero Tapes\n\n        3.      In <]I 42 of her Sixth Contest, Pressley alleges that \"[re ]view of Discovery\n\ndocuments provided by Travis County [show that] no Zero Tapes (showing the number of votes\n\npresent on the Hart Voting equipment for each candidate when the polls open) were printed\n\nduring Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election Day of the Runoff.\" Pressley\n\nhas similar allegations regarding the lack of Zero Tapes in <]I<]I 3, 8,43, and 64 of the Sixth\n\nContest and throughout her previous Contests. 4 At her deposition, however, Pressley testified\n\nthat she didn't know if Zero Tapes were printed, where they were printed, or when. 5 In fact, Zero\n\nTapes were printed.\n\n        4.      Moreover, Pressley attached the Zero Tapes of one District 4 precinct to her Sixth\n\nContest. See Exhibit C to Pressley's Sixth Contest. Travis County also produced the remaining\n\nZero Tapes for all other District 4 precincts to Pressley and her counsel at the document\n\n\n\n\n3 See Pressley Deposition, p. 58.\n4 See Original Contest, !]I 14; Second Amended Contest, !]I!]I 11, 14; Third Amended Contest, !]I 35; Fourth\nAmended Contest, !]I 35; and Fifth Amended Contest, !]I 41.\n5 See Pressley Deposition, p. 134.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               1935\n\fproduction. Pressley's statements to the contrary are without evidentiary support and therefore\n\nviolate CPRC §§ 10.001(3).\n\n                      Allegations Concerning Changes in Voting Locations\n\n        5.      In her first five versions of her Contest, Pressley alleged that Travis County\n\n\"illegally\" disenfranchised several thousand District 4 voters simply because certain voting\n\n                                                                                          6\nlocations were changed or consolidated for the December 16, 2014 runoff election. Pressley\n\nclaims these voters were \"disenfranchised\" because these voting location changes may have\n\n\"inconvenienced\" some voters. Pressley testified that if a voter had to drive only 20 seconds to a\n\n                                                                                              7\nnew voting location, that 20-second drive would constitute voter disenfranchisement. That\n\nfactual allegation is specious, and Pressley has no legal support for her extreme and frivolous\n\nlegal contention. Further, Pressley admitted in her deposition that she failed to attend the Austin\n\nCity Council meeting at which the Council approved the voting locations for the runoff, and\n\nfailed to have any of her ten campaign staffers attend, to object to the locations or request\n\nalternative locations.\n\n        6.      Apparently recognizing the baseless nature of these allegations, Pressley has\n\nomitted those allegations from her Sixth Contest. Including those contentions in the previous five\n\nContest pleadings violated CPRC §§ 10.001(2) and (3).\n\n                          Allegations Concerning Recount Irregularities\n\n        7.      In versions one through five of her Contest, Pressley alleged that numerous\n\nprocedural irregularities and Election Code violations occurred during the January 6,2015\n\n\n\n\n6 See Original Contest,!]I 13; Second Amended Contest,!]I 13; Third Amended Contest,!]I!]I 12-23; Fourth\nAmended Contest,!]I!]I 12-23; and Fifth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 12-29.\n7 See Pressley Deposition, p. 100-101.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           1936\n\f        8\nrecount. Specifically, Pressley claimed that Travis County improperly started the recount before\n\nthe scheduled start time, that the number of voters on voters lists were not publicly reconciled\n\nwith the recounted ballots, that CVRs were improperly used in the recount, and that the \"sum\n\ntotal of those voting irregularities exceeds the number of votes by which the election was\n\ndecided.\"\n\n        8.      In her Sixth Contest, Pressley and her counsel chose again to include allegations\n\nregarding alleged recount irregularities. 9 These allegations included, among others, that CVRs\n\nwere improperly used in the recount, and that Travis County Director of Elections Michael Winn\n\ncommitted a criminal violation by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the\n\nsource, properties, and copying of the CVR files. 10\n\n        9.      As this Court recognized, allegations relating to the recount are legally irrelevant\n\nbecause this case is an election contest, not a recount contest. 11 Under § 221.003(a) of the\n\nElection Code, Pressley was required to show that the runoff election was not the \"true\n\noutcome.\" Any claim or allegation that some alleged error during the recount could affect the\n\n\"true outcome\" of the election is legally frivolous. By incorporating those claims and legal\n\ncontentions into her Contests, Pressley and her counsel violated CPRC § 10.001(2).\n\n                                     Argument and Authorities\n\n        10.     Section 10.001 of the CPRC provides that the signer of a pleading is certifying\n\nthat each claim, each allegation, and each denial is based on the signatory's best knowledge,\n\ninformation, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry. Sections 10.002 and 10.004 authorize,\n\n\n\n8 See Original Contest,!]I 26-44; Second Amended Contest,!]I 26-44; Third Amended Contest, U 41-66;\nFourth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 41-66; and Fifth Amended Contest, U 47-74.\n9 Sixth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 82-101.\n10 Sixth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 93-95.\n\n11 Order Sustaining Contestee's Special Exceptions to Contestant's Fourth Amended Contest, <]I 7, April\n\n13,2015.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          1937\n\famong other remedies, an award of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the person\n\nwho signs the pleading or the represented party or both. Additionally, § 1O.004(c)(2) authorizes\n\nthe Court to order that those persons pay a penalty into court.\n\n        11.    As described above, Pressley's numerous Contests include many frivolous legal\n\ncontentions and factual allegations that are wholly unsupported by evidence. Incredibly, Pressley\n\nand her counsel have continued to make some of these unfounded allegations in no less than six\n\namendments to her Original Contest of Election. Those allegations have required Casar to incur\n\nsubstantial attorney's fees and expenses, and have required Travis County and the taxpayers to\n\nexpend many of tens of thousands of dollars to address Pressley's unsupported allegations and\n\ndemands.\n\n        12.    Casar requests that the Court award against Pressley and her counsel who signed\n\nthe pleadings (i) the reasonable attorney's fees and expenses Casar has incurred in presenting this\n\nmotion and in defending against the claims, allegations, and contentions identified above; (ii) a\n\npenalty into court; and (iii) that the Court issue an Order granting such other relief as the Court\n\ndeems appropriate under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n                                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                      HERRING & IRWIN, L.L.P.\n                                                      1411 West Avenue, Suite 100\n                                                      Austin, Texas 78701\n                                                      (512) 320-0665\n                                                      (512) 519-7580 - Facsimile\n\n\n                                                      By: lsi Charles Herring, Jr.\n                                                         Charles Herring, Jr. - 09534100\n                                                         cherring@herring-irwin.com\n                                                          Lauren Ross - 24092001\n                                                         laurenbross@gma}Lcom\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      1938\n\f                                                      Kurt Kuhn - 24002433\n                                                      Kurt @KuhnHobbs.com\n                                                      KUHN HOBBS PLLC\n                                                      3307 Northland Drive, # 310\n                                                      Austin, Texas 78731\n                                                      (512) 476-6000\n                                                      (512) 476-6002 - Facsimile\n\n\n                                                      Jessica Palvino - 24048780\n                                                      jpalvino@mcginnislaw.com\n                                                      McGINNIS LOCHRIDGE & KILGORE\n                                                      600 Congress Ave., Ste. 2100\n                                                      Austin, Texas 78701\n                                                      (512) 495-6079\n                                                      (512) 505-6379 - Facsimile\n\n                                                      ATTORNEYS FOR CONTESTEE,\n                                                      GREGORIO \"GREG\" CASAR\n\n\n                                  CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n        I certify that a true and correct copy of the above and foregoing Contestee's Third\nAmended Motion for Sanctions has been delivered to counsel for Contestant by electronic\nservice through the electronic filing manager, or if counsel is not registered with the electronic\nfiling manager, by email, to Mr. Mark Cohen, 805 W. 10th , #100, Austin, Texas 78701 and\nMr. David A.

In compliance with Section 10.005 ofthe Civil Practice and Remedies Code, the\n\nCourt makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law supporting this Order\n\nof sanctions:\n\n                                  FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n9.     In November 2002, Travis County began using the Hart Intercivic eSlate system\n\n(the \"Hart eSlate System\") as an electronic voting system.\n\n10.    Since November 2011, Travis County has used a countywide voting system that\n\nemploys central voting centers. Instead of requiring voters to vote at their home precinct\n\npolling locations, vote centers allow all registered voters in Travis County the option of\n\nvoting at any of the county's polling locations on Election Day.\n\n11.    Pressley and Casar were among eight candidates for the District 4 seat of the\n\nAustin City Council at the November 4, 2014 general election. In the general election,\n\nCasar received the highest number of votes (3,272 or 38.63%), Pressley received the\n\nsecond-highest ( 1,826 or 21.56% ), and the remaining votes were distributed among the\n\nother six candidates.\n\n12.    Some voting locations in the City of Austin were changed between the general\n\nand the runoff elections as is normal practice for a runoff election. For the December 16,\n\n2014 runoff, there were 136 citywide voting locations available to all City of Austin\n\nvoters. The City of Austin gave the public notice of the voting locations for the runoff\n\nelection and an opportunity to comment on the proposed locations. On November 13,\n\n2014, the Austin City Council posted the agenda ofthe November 18,2014 Special\n\nCalled Meeting of the Austin City Council. The agenda included setting the run-off\n\nelection and making provisions for the runoff election. On Tuesday, November 18, 2014,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             21\n\f                                    DC             BK15205 PG2207\n\n\n\n\nthe Austin City Council held the special called meeting and approved an ordinance\n\nordering the runoff election. A list of all polling locations for the runoff was attached to\n\nthe City Council's approved ordinance. The locations were also posted at City Hall and in\n\nthe office of the City Clerk, as well as published in the newspaper. Additionally, the City\n\nof Austin and the Travis County Clerk websites both posted information about the runoff\n\nelection and a list of polling locations.\n\n13.     At the November 18, 2014 Austin City Council meeting, neither Pressley nor any\n\nof her ten campaign workers attended the meeting to lodge any complaint or objections\n\nabout the changes in voting locations. Pressley could have attended the meeting but did\n\nnot. Over the years, she has attended and commented at 30 or more Austin City Council\n\nMeetings. She knows where the agendas are posted, knows how to read them in advance,\n\nand is familiar with the process for commenting at a Council meeting.\n\n14.     Casar won the December 16, 2014 runoff election by a margin of almost 65% to\n\n35%; the difference in their vote totals was 1,291 votes. 4,417 votes were cast in the\n\nDistrict 4 runoff election. Of those votes, 480 were mail-in ballots. The remaining 3,93 7\n\nballots were cast using Travis County's chosen electronic voting system, the Hart eSlate\n\nSystem.\n\n15.     As required by Chapter 122 ofthe Election Code, and after an analysis ofthe Hart\n\neSlate System by a team of computer and election law experts, the Secretary of State\n\nreviewed, approved, and certified the Hart eSlate System. The Secretary of State found\n\nthat the Hart eSlate System fully complied with Election Code requirements and, of\n\nparticular relevance in this case, was \"capable of providing records from which the\n\noperation of the system may be audited[.]\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               22\n\f                                DC             BK15205 PG2208\n\n\n\n\n16.     On January 5, 2015, the day before Casar was to be sworn-in, Pressley filed a\n\nrecount petition with the Secretary of State. Before the recount took place, County Clerk\n\nDana DeBeauvoir offered to run an audit of the election results for Pressley. An audit\n\nwould have provided much more detailed information about the electronic votes than a\n\nrecount, including many of the questions Pressley has presented in this lawsuit. Pressley\n\nrefused DeBeauvoir's offer and demanded a recount. An audit would have provided a\n\nreasonable opportunity to view issues raised in the lawsuit and would have allowed for a\n\nreasonable inquiry into many of the allegations alleged by the Contestant in this lawsuit\n\nto determine ifthere was merit to any of such claims.\n\n17.     On January 6, 2015, Travis County conducted a manual recount of all early,\n\nelection day, mail-in, and provisional ballots. The recount confirmed the election result.\n\nJay Brim, the Chair of the Recount Committee, and Dana DeBeauvoir, the Travis County\n\nClerk, supervised the recount. For votes cast electronically, the recount team printed off\n\nthe Cast Vote Records (CVRs), also called Ballot Images. Pressley witnessed the printing\n\nof the Cast Vote Records. All votes were then manually recounted. Mr. Brim found that\n\nthe totals in all precincts matched those in the original canvas, and that the number of\n\nvoters matched the number of ballots cast. He declared that Casar remained the victor of\n\nthe election.\n\n18.     The Secretary of State had a representative present at the recount-Christina\n\nAdkins. During the recount, Pressley complained to Ms. Adkins that the Cast Vote\n\nRecords were not \"images ofballots cast,\" and pointed to the specific provisions of the\n\nElection Code that she believed were germane. Ms. Adkins witnessed the County's use of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             23\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2209\n\n\n\n\nthe Cast Vote Records for the recount, disagreed with Pressley's interpretation of the\n\nElection Code, and refused to challenge the use of the Cast Vote Records in the recount.\n\n19.    After the recount, Pressley lodged several complaints regarding the recount with\n\nthe Secretary of State. One ofPressley's complaints was that she and her poll watchers\n\nwere not allowed to be present at the printing of the ballots as Pressley believed she was\n\nentitled to view the source, properties, retrieval and counting of the ballots. In its January\n\n20, 2015 response letter to Pressley, the Secretary of State dismissed this complaint and\n\nconfirmed that Pressley had been present when the \"ballot images (also known as 'cast\n\nvote records')\" were printed:\n\n               You state that Travis County conducted activities such as\n               extracting data from the Hart electronic voting system,\n               compiling ballot images onto a centralized system, printing\n               ballot images (also known as \"cast vote records\"), and\n               sorting by mail ballots before the recount was scheduled to\n               begin . . . . [W]e agree with you that you and your\n               representatives under Section 213.013(b) were entitled to\n               be present at the printing of the ballot images, and when\n               you raised this issue with the Travis County Elections\n               Division, Travis County agreed to re-print the ballot images\n               in the presence of you and your watchers.\n\n20.     Responding to a subsequent complaint from Pressley, the Secretary of State again\n\nmade the same point in another letter, dated January 27, 2015. That letter also noted that\n\nan inspector from the Secretary of State's office had confirmed the printing of the ballot\n\nImages:\n\n               You have stated that upon your arrival, you discovered that\n               ballot images had already been printed. You alerted Travis\n               County to the issue and reminded them that you and your\n               watchers were entitled to be present at the printing. In\n               response, Travis County began anew with the printing of\n               the ballot images in the presence of you and your watchers,\n               and only the ballot images printed in your presence were\n               used in the recount. This information is confirmed by the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 24\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2210\n\n\n\n\n                inspector sent by our office to attend the recount.\n                Therefore, our office believes you and your watchers were\n                able to witness the printing of all ballot images used in\n                verifying the vote count in your race.\n\n21.     With the Hart eState System, the permanent record of the vote cast is known as a\n\nCast Vote Record or CVR. A CVR is a data field representation depicting which votes\n\nwere cast on each voting device. The Cast Vote Records are used for counting votes and\n\na visual representation of the CVR can be printed in the event of a recount.\n\n22.     The U.S. Election Assistance Commission is an independent, bipartisan\n\ncommission charged with developing guidance to meet the requirements of the Help\n\nAmerica Vote Act of2002. It is charged by statute with adopting voluntary voting system\n\nguidelines and to serve as a national clearinghouse of information on election\n\nadministration. In its Glossary of Key Election Tenninology, the U.S. Election\n\nAssistance Commission defines \"Cast Vote Record\" as \"a ballot image when used to\n\nrefer to electronic ballots.\"\n\n23.     The Texas Secretary of State defines \"Cast Vote Record\" as a Ballot Image. Ten\n\ndays before Pressley filed this lawsuit, the Secretary of State expressly stated in its\n\nJanuary 20, 2015 letter to Pressley that \"ballot images\" are also known as \"cast vote\n\nrecords.\"\n\n24.     As required by the Election Code, Travis County and the City of Austin used the\n\nSecretary of State's definitions when interpreting the Election Code in this case.\n\n25.     On January 31, 2015, Pressley filed her Original Contest of Election against\n\nCasar, seeking to overturn the results of the runoff election for the Austin City Council\n\nDistrict 4 seat. Pressley's Original Contest was signed by her counsel David Rogers.\n\n26.     In paragraphs 32 through 38, the Original Contest alleged that the Hart eState\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            25\n\f                                DC             BK15205 PG2211\n\n\n\n\nSystem did not comply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast\n\nVote Records, which Pressley claimed were not \"images ofballots cast\" under the Texas\n\nElection Code. In paragraph 13, the Original Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised District 4 voters because certain voting locations were changed between\n\nthe general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 14 and 15, the Original Contest\n\nalleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on Election Day as\n\nrequired by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 26 through 44, the Original\n\nContest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the recount.\n\n27.    On February 18, 2015, Pressley filed her Second Amended Contest. In paragraphs\n\n31 through 37, the Second Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\nIn paragraph 13, the Second Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised District 4 voters because certain voting locations were changed between\n\nthe general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 11 and 14, the Second\n\nAmended Contest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on\n\nElection Day as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 26 through 44,\n\nthe Second Amended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the\n\nrecount.\n\n28.    On February 27, 2015, Pressley filed her Third Amended Contest. In paragraphs\n\n43 through 53, the Third Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              26\n\f                                  DC            BK15205 PG2212\n\n\n\n\nIn paragraphs 12 through 23, the Third Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised District 4 voters because certain voting locations were changed between\n\nthe general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 35 and 37, the Third Amended\n\nContest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on Election\n\nDay as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 41 through 66, the Third\n\nAmended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the recount that\n\nmaterially affected the election results.\n\n29.     On March 12,2015, Pressley filed her Fourth Amended Contest. In paragraphs 43\n\nthrough 53, the Fourth Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\nIn paragraphs 12 through 23, the Fourth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised thousands of District 4 voters because certain voting locations were\n\nchanged between the general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 35 and 37,\n\nthe Fourth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and\n\nresults tapes on Election Day as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs\n\n41 through 66, the Fourth Amended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities\n\noccurred during the recount that materially affected the election results.\n\n30.     On April 16, 2015, the deposition of Pressley took place. At her deposition,\n\nPressley admitted that she could not identify a single voter who was disenfranchised by\n\nthe change in voting locations for the runoff election. Pressley did testify she had spoken\n\nwith people who claimed they had difficulty in voting, but she was not able to obtain\n\neven one affidavit from one voter who claimed to have been disenfranchised. Pressley\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              27\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2213\n\n\n\n\nalso admitted that she did not know what a Cast Vote Record was and that the U.S.\n\nElection Assistance Commission, the Texas Secretary of State, Travis County, and the\n\nCity of Austin all reject her definition of\"ballot image.\" Pressley also testified that she\n\ndid not know if zero tapes had been printed, where they may have been printed, or when.\n\n31.    On April 20, 2015, Pressley filed her Fifth Amended Contest. In paragraphs 49\n\nthrough 59, the Fifth Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\nIn paragraphs 12 through 29, the Fifth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised thousands of District 4 voters because certain voting locations were\n\nchanged between the general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 41 and 43,\n\nthe Fifth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results\n\ntapes on Election Day as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 47\n\nthrough 74, the Fifth Amended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred\n\nduring the recount that materially affected the election results.\n\n32.    Pressley filed her final and Sixth Amended Contest on May 19, 2015. In\n\nparagraphs 3, 13, 82, 84, and 97 through 138, the Sixth Amended Contest alleged that the\n\nHart eSlate System did not comply with the Texas Election Code because it could print\n\nonly Cast Vote Records, which Pressley claimed were not \"images ofballots cast\" under\n\nthe Texas Election Code. In paragraphs 3, 4, 8, 42 through 52, and 64, the Fifth Amended\n\nContest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on Election\n\nDay as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 82 through 101, the Fifth\n\nAmended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the recount that\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              28\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2214\n\n\n\n\nmaterially affected the election results. In paragraphs 93 and 94, Pressley alleged that\n\nTravis County Director of Elections Michael Winn committed a criminal violation by not\n\nallowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, properties, and copying of the\n\nCVR files during the recount. Pressley dropped from her Sixth Amended Contest her\n\nallegations that Travis County disenfranchised thousands of District 4 voters because\n\ncertain voting locations were changed between the general election and the runoff\n\nelection.\n\n33.      Travis County produced documents in this case on April22 and 23, 2015. County\n\nClerk Dana DeBeauvoir was deposed on May 11, 2015. The due date for the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment response was May 19,2015. On May 22,2015, County Clerk Dana\n\nDeBeauvoir made changes to her deposition testimony.\n\n34.      On May 26, 2015, after briefing and a hearing, this Court granted Casar's no-\n\nevidence summary judgment motion, which establishes that Pressley failed to raise any\n\ngenuine issue of material fact in response to Casar's motion.\n\n35.      Rogers had prior experience working on election contest cases. According to\n\nRogers, most successful election contests involved a margin of victory of less than 50\n\nvotes.\n\n36.      Before filing the Contests, Rogers had never heard of an election contest case in\n\nwhich a contestant had overcome a margin of victory of 1,291 votes.\n\n37.      Before filing the Contests, Rogers was aware of the Texas Supreme Court\n\ndecision in Andrade v. NAACP, 345 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2011), in which the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt rejected an equal-protection challenge to the Hart eSlate System and held that\n\n\"[t[he Secretary [of State] made a reasonable, nondiscriminatory choice to certify the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             29\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2215\n\n\n\n\neSlate, a decision justified by the State's important regulatory interests.\"\n\n38.      The Cast Vote Record is a \"ballot image\" as that term is used in the Texas\n\nElection Code.\n\n39.      The U.S. Election Assistance Commission and Texas Secretary of State have\n\nconsistently stated that for electronic voting, the Cast Vote Record is the Ballot Image.\n\nThe Secretary of State stated this to Pressley explicitly in its January 20, 2015 letter to\n\nher.\n\n40.      The City of Austin and Travis County define a Cast Vote Record as a Ballot\n\nImage.\n\n41.      Texas Election Code § 52.075 gives the Secretary of State authority to prescribe\n\nthe form and content ofballots for electronic voting machines.\n\n42.      Texas Election Code§ 129.002 of the Election Code gives the Secretary of State\n\nthe authority to implement Direct Recording Electronic voting systems that utilize Cast\n\nVote Records.\n\n43.      Pressley and Rogers did not cite the 1990 Federal Election Commission\n\nPerformance and Test Standards until the Sixth Amended Contest, and these standards do\n\nnot distinguish a Ballot Image from a Cast Vote Record. The 2002 Federal Election\n\nCommission Report entitled \"Voting Systems Standards Volume I- Performance\n\nStandards\" defines Ballot Image as \"an electronic record of all votes cast by the voter.\"\n\n44.      Pressley and Rogers did not cite the 2007 Source Code Review of the Hart\n\nIntercivic Voting System until the Sixth Amended Contest, and this report does not\n\ndistinguish a Ballot Image from a Cast Vote Record.\n\n45.      The allegation that the consolidation or changing of voting locations for the runoff\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                30\n\f                                  DC              BK15205 PG2216\n\n\n\n\nelection disenfranchised District 4 voters is not warranted by existing law or by a\n\nnonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment ofnew law. See Gonzalez v Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763,777-778 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Corpus Christi 2008, pet. dism'd w.o.j.).\n\n46.    There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that the consolidation or\n\nchanging of voting locations for the runoff election disenfranchised District 4 voters.\n\n47.    The Texas Secretary of State repeatedly rejected Pressley's complaints regarding\n\nalleged irregularities at the recount, including both at the recount itself and in multiple\n\nsubsequent letters responding to Pressley's complaints.\n\n48.    The allegation that irregularities allegedly occurred during the recount materially\n\naffected the outcome of the runoff election is not warranted by existing law or by a\n\nnonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment of new law.\n\n49.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that irregularities that allegedly\n\noccurred during the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff election. See\n\nGonzalez v Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763, 777-778 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2008, pet.\n\ndism'd w.o.j.).\n\n50.     The allegations that Travis County Director of Elections Michael Winn\n\ncommitted a criminal violation are not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous\n\nargument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\n\n51.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that Travis County Director of\n\nElections Michael Winn committed a Class A misdemeanor criminal violation by not\n\nallowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, properties, and copying of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                31\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2217\n\n\n\n\nCVR files at the recount. The Election Code provides that at a recount, the candidate and\n\nher representatives are entitled to be present \"during the printing of the images [ofballots\n\ncast].\" Pressley and her poll watchers were present while the Travis County recount team\n\nprinted all of the CVRs for the recount. The Secretary of State confirmed this in its\n\nJanuary 27, 2015 letter to Pressley, stating \"Travis County began anew with the printing\n\nof the ballot images in the presence of you and your watchers, and only the ballot images\n\nprinted in your presence were used in the recount. This information is confirmed by the\n\ninspector sent by our office to attend the recount. Therefore, our office believes you and\n\nyour watchers were able to witness the printing of all ballot images used in verifying the\n\nvote count in your race.\"\n\n52.    Pressley and Rogers failed to exercise due diligence in investigating the\n\nevidentiary support for each of the allegations in the Contests before filing them.\n\n53.    Pressley testified that she does not know what a \"Cast Vote Record\" is.\n\n54.    Pressley acknowledged that the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the Texas\n\nSecretary of State, Travis County, and the City of Austin all reject her definition of\n\n\"ballot image.\"\n\n55.     Over 100 counties in Texas use the Hart eSlate System. County Clerk DeBeauvoir\n\ntestified that, before this lawsuit, she had never heard anyone ever allege that CVRs are\n\nnot ballot images for purposes of electronic voting. She also serves on the Standards\n\nBoard for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\n56.     County Clerk DeBeauvoir fully complied with the Texas Election Code and\n\nSecretary of State procedures in conducting the general and runoff elections.\n\n57.     Pressley failed to exercise her right to comment on or object to any of the voting\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               32\n\f                                    DC           BK15205 PG2218\n\n\n\n\nlocation changes at the Austin City Council meeting.\n\n58.    Consolidating voting locations between a general election and a runoff election is\n\na routine and entirely legal and proper practice. Such changes occur for a variety of\n\nlegitimate reasons, including to achieve cost and staffing efficiencies due to the lower\n\nvoter turnout and fewer number of candidates generally associated with runoffs. In this\n\nelection, a total of304 candidates were on the ballot countywide at the November 4, 2014\n\ngeneral election. By contrast, in the runoff election in District 4, only four races were on\n\nthe ballot: this Council race, the Mayor's race, and 2 school district races-a total of\n\neight candidates.\n\n59.     Because Travis County uses countywide voting centers, any voter in Travis\n\nCounty could vote at any one ofthe 136 voting locations across the county for the runoff\n\nelection. In District 4 alone, there were 9 voting centers within the district, as well as 7\n\ncenters located within a five-minute drive of the district and 17 centers located within a\n\nten-minute drive of the district.\n\n60.     Pressley testified if a voter had to drive as little as 20 seconds to a new voting\n\nlocation, that voter was disenfranchised.\n\n61.     Rogers did not identify a single witness who could or would testify that changes\n\nin voting locations had disenfranchised District 4 voters.\n\n62.     When Pressley was deposed on Aprill6, 2015, she could not identify a single\n\nvoter who was disenfranchised as a result of the changes in voting locations. Four days\n\nlater, on April20, 2015, she filed her Fifth Amended Contest, which alleged in Paragraph\n\n29 that 1,108 voters, at least, were disenfranchised as a result of the change in voting\n\nlocation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               33\n\f                                  DC              BK15205 PG2219\n\n\n\n\n63.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that the Austin City Council\n\nchanged the voting locations for the runoff to disenfranchise any District 4 voters.\n\n64.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that the changes in the voting\n\nlocations for the runoff resulted in the disenfranchisement of any District 4 voters.\n\n65.     There is no evidentiary support that any voter was actually prevented from voting\n\nat the new locations.\n\n66.     Paragraph 42 of Pressley's Sixth Amended Contest states that \"[r]eview of\n\nDiscovery documents provided by Travis County [shows that] no Zero Tapes (showing\n\nthe number of votes present on the Hart Voting equipment for each candidate when the\n\npolls open) were printed during Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election\n\nDay of the Runoff.\" Similar allegations are contained in ,-r,-r 3, 8, 43, & 64 of the Sixth\n\nAmended Contest and in prior Contests.\n\n67.     Zero Tapes were produced to Pressley and Rogers by Travis County during their\n\ndocument production on April22 and 23, 2015. Pressley's Sixth Amended Contest was\n\nfiled on May 19, 2015.\n\n68.     Travis County printed zero tapes both before the runoff election and on the day of\n\nthe runoff election. There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that zero tapes were\n\nnot printed on the day of the runoff election.\n\n69.     Pressley and Rogers attached as Exhibit C to the Sixth Contest a zero tape that\n\nwas printed on December 16, 2014, the day of the runoff election.\n\n70.     Results tapes were printed the day of the runoff election. There is no evidentiary\n\nsupport for the allegation that results tapes were not printed as required by the Texas\n\nSecretary of State.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               34\n\f                                  DC              BK15205 PG2220\n\n\n\n\n71.     Pressley took a personal and participatory role in this lawsuit. Pressley testified\n\nshe personally authored portions of the Contests and their appendices. She estimated that\n\nshe spent hours and hours working on the lawsuit and that she had worked until 3 :00 a.m.\n\ndrafting the Contests. Pressley was present at the deposition of County Clerk\n\nDeBeauvoir, as well as the two-day document production by the County Clerk's office.\n\n72.     Pressley testified at least three people assisted her in drafting discovery and with\n\nvarious other aspects of this election contest.\n\n73.     Pressley testified Contestee Casar has done nothing wrong in the conduct of the\n\nelection.\n\n74.     Pressley testified she has assets and income sufficient to be able to pay a\n\nmonetary sanction. Specifl.cally, Pressley has: (1) approximately $30,000 to $40,000 that\n\nshe has raised for the cost of pursuing this Contest and the appeal; (2) at least $170,000 in\n\nher business account for Pure Rain LLC, which is a Limited Liability Company of which\n\nshe is the only owner; (3) real estate in Wyoming with a net value ofbetween $10,000\n\nand $25,000; (4) profit from a home that she and her husband recently sold for\n\napproximately $530,000; (5) annual sales of$50,000 to $60,000 per year from Pure Rain\n\nLLC; (6) annual income of approximately $130,000 to $160,000 from her husband's job\n\nas an engineer at Applied Materials; (7) a personal checking account valued at\n\napproximately $1 ,000; (8) her husband's personal account which is valued at\n\napproximately $5,000; and (9) savings of approximately $51,500 in legal fees which were\n\nowed to her attorney David Rogers. Additionally, Pressley has income earning capacity\n\nof over $100,000 per year based on her previous jobs.\n\n75.     Rogers has assets and income sufficient to be able to pay a monetary sanction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                35\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2221\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Rogers is a practicing attorney who charges approximately $350/hour.\n\nAdditionally, Rogers testified he has the financial ability to be able to forgo legal fees of\n\napproximately $51,500 from Pressley.\n\nFindings of Fact Supporting Attorneys Fees\n\n76.    During this litigation, Casar retained Charles Herring, Jr. and Lauren Ross of\n\nHerring & Irwin LLP and Jessica Palvino of McGinnis Lochridge & Kilgore LLP.\n\n77.    The services rendered by Charles Herring, Jr., Lauren Ross, and Jessica Palvino in\n\ndefending Casar in this litigation were reasonable and necessary for these types of\n\nservices in Travis County.\n\n78.    The fees charged by Herring & Irwin LLP and McGinnis Lochridge & Kilgore\n\nLLP in defending Casar in this litigation were $ 150,000.00.\n\n79.     The fees and rates charged by Charles Herring, Jr., Lauren Ross, and Jessica\n\nPalvino in defending Casar in this litigation were reasonable and customary for these\n\ntypes of services in Travis County.\n\n                                CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n80.     Irregularities that allegedly occurred during the recount did not materially affect\n\nthe outcome of the runoff election. See Gonzalez v Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763, 777-778\n\n(Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2008, pet. dism'd w.o.j.) (headnotes 10 and 11).\n\n81.     At the time the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth Amended,\n\nFifth Amended, and Sixth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers certified that to his best\n\nknowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, that the allegation\n\nthat irregularities that occurred during the recount materially affected the outcome of the\n\nrunoff election was warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument tor the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                36\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2222\n\n\n\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n82.    There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that irregularities that allegedly\n\noccurred during the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff election. See\n\nGonzalez v Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763,777-778 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2008, pet.\n\ndism'd w.o.j.).\n\n83.    Rogers failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether each allegation (that\n\nirregularities that allegedly occurred during the recount materially affected the outcome\n\nof the runoff election) was warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for\n\nthe extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n84.    Rogers knew or should have known this allegation (that irregularities that\n\nallegedly occurred during the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff\n\nelection) was not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n85.    A reasonable inquiry would have revealed irregularities that allegedly occurred\n\nduring the recount did not materially affect the outcome of the runoff election.\n\n86.    The allegations that irregularities that allegedly occurred during the recount\n\nmaterially affected the outcome of the runoff election were not supported by existing law\n\nand there was not a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of\n\nexisting law or the establishment of new law.\n\n87.    By failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether the legal contentions in\n\nthe Contests were warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law, Rogers violated Section 10.001 (2) of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               37\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2223\n\n\n\n\n88.    By asserting legal contentions in the Contests that were not warranted by existing\n\nlaw or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing\n\nlaw, Rogers violated Section 10.001(2) ofthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n89.    This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers because of this\n\nviolation of Section 10.001 (2). This authority arises from Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that determines that a person\n\nhas signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001 may impose a sanction on\n\nthe person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n90.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, Fifth Amended, and Sixth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley\n\ncertified that, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after\n\nreasonable inquiry, each allegation or other factual contention in the Contests had\n\nevidentiary support, including the allegation that irregularities that allegedly occurred\n\nduring the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff election.\n\n91.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, Fifth Amended, and Sixth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley\n\nfailed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether their allegation (that irregularities that\n\nallegedly occurred during the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff\n\nelection) had evidentiary support.\n\n92.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, Fifth Amended, and Sixth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley\n\nknew or should have known their allegation that irregularities that allegedly occurred\n\nduring the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff election did not have\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 38\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2224\n\n\n\n\nevidentiary support.\n\n93.    The allegation that irregularities that allegedly occurred during the recount\n\nmaterially affected the outcome of the runoff election has no evidentiary support.\n\n94.    By failing to make a reasonable inquiry into whether factual claims in the\n\nContests had evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe\n\nCivil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n95.    By asserting factual claims in the Contests that Pressley and Rogers knew were\n\nwithout evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code.\n\n96.    This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers and on Laura\n\nPressley because of this violation of Section 10.001 (3 ). This authority arises from Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001\n\nmay impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n97.    Travis County Director of Elections Michael Winn did not commit a criminal\n\nviolation by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, properties,\n\nand copying of the CVR files during the recount.\n\n98.    At the time the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers certified that to the best\n\nof his knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, that the\n\nallegation that Mr. Winn committed a criminal violation by not allowing Pressley and her\n\npoll watchers to view the source, property, and copying of the CVR files was warranted\n\nby existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or\n\nreversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              39\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2225\n\n\n\n\n99.    Rogers failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether this allegation (that\n\nMichael Winn committed a criminal violation) was warranted by existing law or by a\n\nnon-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment of new law.\n\n100.   Rogers knew that this allegation (that Michael Winn committed a criminal\n\nviolation) was not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n101.   A reasonable inquiry would have revealed that Mr. Winn did not violate Texas\n\nElection Code§ 33.061 by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source\n\nand properties of the CVR files during the recount; that, under Election Code§ 213.016,\n\nPressley and her poll watchers were allowed to be and were present for the printing of the\n\nCVRs; and that nothing in the Election Code authorized Pressley or her poll watchers to\n\nview the source and properties of the CVR files, such as dates of the CVR files and\n\norigination.\n\n102.   The allegations that Mr. Winn committed criminal violations were not supported\n\nby existing law and there was not a non-frivolous argument for the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n103.   By failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether the legal contentions in\n\nthe Contests were warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law, Rogers violated Section 10.001(2) of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n104.   By asserting legal contentions in the Contests that were not warranted by existing\n\nlaw or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             40\n\f                                 DC            BK15205 PG2226\n\n\n\n\nlaw, Rogers violated Section 10.001(2) ofthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n105.   This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers because of this\n\nviolation of Section 10.001 (2). This authority arises from Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that determines that a person\n\nhas signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001 may impose a sanction on\n\nthe person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n106.   At the time the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley certified\n\nthat, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief: formed after reasonable\n\ninquiry, each allegation or other factual contention in the Contests had evidentiary\n\nsupport, including the allegation that Mr. Winn committed a criminal violation by not\n\nallowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, property, and copying of the\n\nCVR files.\n\n107.   At the time that the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley failed\n\nto conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether their allegation (that Mr. Winn committed a\n\ncriminal violation by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source,\n\nproperty, and copying of the CVR files) had evidentiary support.\n\n108.   At the time that the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley knew\n\nthat their allegation (that Mr. Winn committed a criminal violation by not allowing\n\nPressley and her poll watchers to view the source, property, and copying of the CVR\n\nfiles) did not have evidentiary support.\n\n109.   The allegation that Mr. Winn committed a criminal violation by not allowing\n\nPressley and her poll watchers to view the source, property, and copying of the CVR files\n\nhas no evidentiary support.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            41\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2227\n\n\n\n\n110.   By failing to make a reasonable inquiry into whether factual claims in the\n\nContests had evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe\n\nCivil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n111.   By asserting factual claims in the Contests that Pressley and Rogers knew were\n\nwithout evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code.\n\n112.   This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers and on Laura\n\nPressley because of this violation of Section 10.001 (3 ). This authority arises from Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001\n\nmay impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n113.   No credible evidence exists to prove that any Travis County voters were\n\ndisenfranchised by the consolidation of voting locations between the general election,\n\nheld on November 4, 2014 and the runoff election held on December 16, 2014.\n\n114.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers certified that to his best\n\nknowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, that the allegation\n\nthat Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by consolidating voting\n\nlocations was warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n115.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers failed to conduct a reasonable\n\ninquiry in whether this allegation (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              42\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2228\n\n\n\n\nvoters by consolidating voting locations) was supported by existing law or a non-\n\nfrivolous argument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment of new law.\n\n116.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers knew or should have known\n\nthat this allegation (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by\n\nconsolidating voting locations) was unsupported by existing law or a non-frivolous\n\nargument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of\n\nnew law.\n\n11 7.   A reasonable inquiry would have revealed that existing law did not support the\n\nallegation that voters had been illegally disenfranchised by the consolidation of voting\n\nlocations, and that there was not a non-frivolous argument for the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n118.    By failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether the legal contentions in\n\nthe Contests were warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law, Rogers violated Section 10.001 (2) of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n119.    By asserting legal contentions in the Contests that were not warranted by existing\n\nlaw or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing\n\nlaw, Rogers violated Section 10.001(2) ofthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n120.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley certified that, to\n\nthe best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             43\n\f                                  DC            BK15205 PG2229\n\n\n\n\neach allegation or other factual contention in the Contest had evidentiary support,\n\nincluding the allegations that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by\n\nconsolidating voting locations.\n\n121.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, and Fourth\n\nAmended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry\n\ninto whether these factual allegations (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised\n\nDistrict 4 voters by consolidating voting locations) had evidentiary support.\n\n122.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, and Fourth\n\nAmended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley knew that these factual allegations\n\n(that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by consolidating voting\n\nlocations) had no evidentiary support.\n\n123.   At the time that the Fifth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley knew\n\nthat these allegations (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by\n\nconsolidating voting locations) did not have evidentiary support. Pressley testified four\n\ndays prior to filing the Fifth Amended Contest that she could not identify a single voter\n\nwho was disenfranchised due to the change in voting locations. Pressley testified that\n\nregardless of the fact that she could not obtain one affidavit from one voter attesting to\n\ndisenfranchisement of voters, she made her claims based on statistical analysis of prior\n\nvoting patterns and conversations she had with persons she could not identify.\n\n124.   The allegation that Travis County illegally disenfranchised thousands of District 4\n\nvoters by consolidating voting locations has no evidentiary support.\n\n125.   By failing to make a reasonable inquiry into whether factual claims in the\n\nContests had evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              44\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2230\n\n\n\n\nCivil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n126.   By asserting factual claims in the Contests that Pressley and Rogers knew were\n\nwithout evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code.\n\n127.   This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers and Laura\n\nPressley because of this violation of Section 10.001 (3). This authority arises from Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001\n\nmay impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n128.   Travis County printed zero tapes and results tapes for the runoff election as\n\nrequired by the Texas Secretary of State. Some of the zero tapes were printed prior to the\n\ndate ofthe run-off election held on December 16,2014.\n\n129.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley certified that, to\n\nthe best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry,\n\neach allegation or other factual contention in the Contest had evidentiary support,\n\nincluding the allegations that Travis County failed to print zero tapes and results tapes in\n\naccordance with the Texas Secretary of State's requirements.\n\n130.   At the time that the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley\n\ncertified that, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after\n\nreasonable inquiry, each allegation or other factual contention in the Contest had\n\nevidentiary support, including the allegations that \"discovery documents provided by\n\nTravis County [shows that] no Zero Tapes (showing the number of votes present on the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               45\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2231\n\n\n\n\nHart Voting equipment for each candidate when the polls open) were printed during\n\nEarly Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election Day of the Runoff.\"\n\n131.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley knew that these\n\nallegations (that Travis County failed to print zero tapes and results tapes in accordance\n\nwith the Texas Secretary of State's requirements) lacked evidentiary support.\n\n132.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley failed to conduct\n\na reasonable inquiry into whether these allegations (that Travis County failed to print\n\nzero tapes and results tapes in accordance with the Texas Secretary of State's\n\nrequirements) had evidentiary support.\n\n133.   At the time that the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley knew\n\nthat these allegations (that Travis County failed to print zero tapes and results tapes in\n\naccordance with the Texas Secretary of State's requirements and that discovery\n\ndocuments provided by Travis County showed that no Zero Tapes were printed during\n\nEarly Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election Day of the Runoff) lacked\n\nevidentiary support. Zero Tapes were produced by Travis County during their document\n\nproduction on April22 and 23, 2015. Pressley's Sixth Amended Contest was filed on\n\nMay 19,2015. Pressley and Rogers attached as Exhibit C to the Sixth Contest a zero tape\n\nthat was printed on December 16, 2014, the day of the runoff election. County Clerk\n\nDana DeBeauvoir testified in her deposition on May 11, 2015 that zero tapes and results\n\ntapes were printed.\n\n134.    The allegations that Travis County failed to print zero tapes and results tapes in\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             46\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2232\n\n\n\n\naccordance with the Texas Secretary of State's requirements have no evidentiary support.\n\nSome of the zero tapes were not printed on December 16, 2014, the date of the runoff\n\nelection.\n\n135.    The allegations that discovery documents provided by Travis County showed that\n\nno Zero Tapes were printed during Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on\n\nElection Day of the Runoffhas no evidentiary support.\n\n136.    By failing to make a reasonable inquiry into whether factual claims in the\n\nContests had evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) of the\n\nCivil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n137.    By asserting factual claims in the Contests that Pressley and Rogers knew were\n\nwithout evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) of the Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code.\n\n138.    This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers and Laura\n\nPressley because ofthis violation ofSection 10.001(3). This authority arises from Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001\n\nmay impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n139.    The factors articulated by the Texas Supreme Court in Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d\n\n609 (Tex. 2007), support an award of sanctions in this case.\n\n140.    The first Low factor, the good faith or bad faith of the offender, weighs in favor of\n\nawarding sanctions. Pressley's conduct during the case, including making false\n\nallegations of criminal activity against the Travis County Director of Elections Michael\n\nWinn, indicate that she was not acting in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                47\n\f                                  DC            BK15205 PG2233\n\n\n\n\n141.    The second Low factor, the degree of willfulness, vindictiveness, negligence, or\n\nfrivolousness involved in the offense, weighs heavily in favor of sanctions. Pressley lost\n\nthe election by a margin of 1,291 votes, a margin far greater than Rogers had ever seen\n\nand greater than has been overcome in the history of reported Texas jurisprudence. The\n\nHart eSlate system, which Pressley alleges violated the Texas Election Code, was\n\ncertified by the Texas Secretary of State and variations of the system have been used in\n\nother counties in Texas. There are two court decisions rejecting attacks on the Hart eSlate\n\nsystem. In the Andrade v. NAACP case, 345 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2011), the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt found that \"[t]he Secretary made a reasonable, nondiscriminatory choice to certify\n\nthe eSlate, a decision justified by the State's important regulatory interests.\" In Texas\n\nDemocratic Party v. Williams, No. A-07-CA-115-SS (W.O. Tex. Aug. 16, 2007), the\n\nWestern District of Texas noted that the Secretary of State \"made a reasonable, politically\n\nneutral, and non-discriminatory choice to certify the eSlate voting machines for use in\n\nelections, and nothing in the Constitution forbids this choice.\" Rogers was either aware of\n\nor failed to adequately investigate the legal and factual bases for Pressley's allegations.\n\n142.   The third Low factor, the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the offender,\n\nalso weighs in favor of awarding sanctions. Rogers is an experienced attorney who has\n\nhandled election contests previously and holds himself out as being knowledgeable\n\nregarding election contests. Pressley has a PhD in Chemistry, is actively involved in her\n\ncommunity, and has appeared before Austin City Council at least thirty times. She was\n\npersonally involved in drafting portions of the Contests and discovery.\n\n143.    The fourth Low factor, any prior history of sanctionable conduct on the part of the\n\noffender, is not applicable in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              48\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2234\n\n\n\n\n144.    The fifth Low factor, the reasonableness and necessity of the out-of-pocket\n\nexpenses incurred by the offended person as a result of the misconduct, weighs in favor\n\nof awarding sanctions. Contestee Casar seeks the reasonable and necessary attorney's\n\nfees incurred in defending this election contest, and his attorneys are charging a reduced\n\nhourly rate. Casar has not yet paid any of his attorney fees.\n\n145.    The sixth Low factor, the nature and extent of prejudice, apart from out-of-pocket\n\nexpenses, suffered by the offended person as a result of the misconduct, also weighs in\n\nfavor of awarding sanctions. Contestee Casar is now a Council Member for the City of\n\nAustin, and has been required to divide his time between his duties as a Council Member\n\nand responding to Pressley's Election Contests. His city council annual salary is\n\napproximately $70,000.00.\n\n146.    The seventh Low factor, the relative culpability of client and counsel, also weighs\n\nin favor of awarding sanctions. Pressley took a personal and participatory role in this\n\nlawsuit. She testified she drafted portions of the Contests, drafted discovery questions to\n\nTravis County for Rogers to decide how to use, and was, according to Rogers, the most\n\nhands-on client he's ever had.\n\n14 7.   The eighth Low factor, the risk of chilling the specific type of litigation involved,\n\nalso weighs in favor of awarding sanctions. There should not be a chilling effect from\n\nawarding sanctions in this case, as the purpose of sanctions in this case would be to\n\nencourage compliance with Chapter 10.\n\n148.    The ninth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offender, including the\n\noffender's ability to pay a monetary sanction, also weighs in favor of awarding sanctions.\n\nPressley has assets and income potential due to her high level of education sufficient to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                49\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2235\n\n\n\n\njustify the award of sanctions. Rogers has the ability to earn income sufficient to justify\n\nthe award of sanctions.\n\n149.    The tenth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offended party, including\n\nthe offended person's need for compensation, also weighs in favor of awarding sanctions.\n\nPressley testified she knew of nothing Contestee Casar did wrong in the conduct of the\n\nelection. Because of Pressley's election contest, Contestee Casar has incurred more than\n\n$150,000 in attorney's fees and has been unable to fully devote himself to his role as City\n\nCouncilmember. His annual income as a council member is far less than Ms. Pressley's.\n\n150.    The eleventh Low factor, the relative magnitude of sanction necessary to achieve\n\nthe goal or goals of the sanction, also weighs in favor of awarding sanctions. The goals in\n\nawarding sanctions, according to the Texas Supreme Court in Remington Arms v.\n\nCaldwell are compensation, punishment, and deterrence. 850 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. 1993).\n\nThe Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code Section 10.004 states that the sanction\n\nmust be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable\n\nconduct by others similarly situated. The same challenge to the Hart eSlate voting system\n\nthat was brought by Pressley in this Election Contest could have been brought against any\n\nelected official in Austin, Travis County, or the hundreds of other counties in Texas that\n\nuse the eSlate voting machine. It is important to deter these types of challenges to the\n\nHart eSlate voting system, which has been fully approved and certified by the Texas\n\nSecretary of State.\n\n151.    The twelfth Low factor, burdens on the court system attributable to the\n\nmisconduct, including consumption of judicial time and incurrence of juror fees and other\n\ncourt costs, have to date minimal impact in favor of awarding sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              50\n\f                                 DC            BK15205 PG2236\n\n\n\n\n152.   The thirteenth Low factor, the degree to which the offended person's own\n\nbehavior caused the expenses for which recovery is sought, also weighs in favor of\n\nawarding sanctions. Pressley admits that Casar did nothing wrong in the conduct of the\n\nelection.\n\n153.    Rogers and Pressley failed to show due diligence in violation of Section 10.002 of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n154.    All Conclusions of Law shall also be deemed to be Findings of Fact. To the extent\n\nany Conclusion of Law is a Finding of Fact or is a mixed question oflaw and fact, the\n\nsame is found as a fact.\n\nIT SO ORDERED.                tL\n        SIGNED this the    2} day of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             51\n\f                                                                                    Filed in The District Court\n                                       DC                  BK15212 PG776             of Travis County, Texas\n\n                                                                                          JUL 2 3 2015 q\n                                                                                   At\n                                                                                            (           .0\n                                                                                           I 0'0.:.:Y AM.\n                                      NO.

On June 12,2015,\n\nContestee Casar timely filed his Third Amended Motion for Sanctions to amend the May\n\n26,2015 Order to include an award of sanctions. On June 24,2015, the Court entered an\n\nAmended Summary Judgment Order that amended and replaced the May 26,2015 Order.\n\nThe Court now enters this Amended Final Judgment and FINDS and ORDERS as\n\nfollows:\n\n       1.

As this case is not legally complex, and as the facts are straightforward,\n\nRogers does not request oral argument.

Therein, Pressley designated Mark Cohen,\n\nEsq., as lead counsel in the election contest in the trial court below, replacing\n\nRogers as lead counsel and demoting him to co-counsel. Shortly after Cohen’s\n\ndesignation, Pressley was deposed by Casar’s trial counsel. Cohen defended that\n\ndeposition. During that deposition, Pressley did not specifically name persons who\n\nwere disenfranchised by the closure and consolidation of election precincts.\n\n(070215 CR 603-606)\n\n8.

Rogers filed the original election contest. Beginning with the April 16,\n\n2015 Notice of Designation of Lead Counsel, Mark Cohen was the attorney-in-\n\ncharge, responsible for all subsequent filings in the case. TEX. R. CIV. PRO. 8.\n\nRule 8 states:\n\n       RULE 8. ATTORNEY-IN-CHARGE On the occasion of a party's\n       first appearance through counsel, the attorney whose signature first\n       appears on the initial pleadings for any party shall be the attorney-in-\n       charge, unless another attorney is specifically designated therein.\n       Thereafter, until such designation is changed by written notice to the\n       court and all other parties in accordance with Rule 21a, said\n       attorney-in-charge shall be responsible for the suit as to such party.\n       All communications from the court or other counsel with respect to a\n       suit shall be sent to the attorney-in-charge.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n24.    Casar therefore lacked standing to move for sanctions against Rogers based\n\non post April 16, 2015 pleadings because Rogers was no longer the attorney-in-\n\ncharge of Pressley’s election contest. Casar lacked standing to seek sanctions from\n\nRogers. Standing is essential to a court’s jurisdiction. The trial court therefore\n\nlacked jurisdiction to award sanctions against Rogers. The trial court could not\n\nsanction Rogers on that basis.\n\n25.    Though this jurisdictional challenge was not raised below, a court’s\n\nRogers Appellant Brief                                                            p. 7\n\fjurisdiction may be challenged for the first time on appeal.\n\n26.                                 Based on the documents presented to the trial court, there was no basis for\n\nawarding attorney’s fees against Rogers related to filing the Fifth or Sixth\n\nAmended Contest or Contestant’s Response to Contestee’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment, all filed after Cohen was designated as lead counsel.\n\n27.                                 Rogers adopts Pressleys’ Brief, excepting Pressley’s arguments on pages 57-\n\n58 regarding the third Low4 factor. Pressley’s claims, both before and after the date\n\nCohen became lead counsel were sufficiently supported by fact and law and\n\nadequate investigation was made under the existing circumstances. The multiple\n\namendments are proof that Pressley’s counsel were responsive to the obligation to\n\npromptly amend pleadings as new facts were uncovered.\n\n28.                                 Rogers requests this honorable Appeals Court reverse and render, denying\n\nCasar’s motion for sanctions against Rogers.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                              Argument\n\n   Issues 4-6\n\n29.

Standing is implicit in the concept of subject-matter\n       jurisdiction. . . . Under the Texas Constitution, standing is implicit in\n       the open courts provision, which contemplates access to the courts\n       only for those litigants suffering an injury. . . . Because standing is a\n       constitutional prerequisite to maintaining a suit under both federal and\n       Texas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience\n       of the federal courts on this subject for any guidance it may yield.\n       Under federal law, a lack of standing deprives a court of\n       subject matter jurisdiction because standing is an element of such\n       jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction is an issue that may be raised\n       for the first time on appeal; it may not be waived by the parties.\n       Because we conclude that standing is a component of subject matter\n\nRogers Appellant Brief                                                             p. 10\n\f                                                           jurisdiction, it cannot be waived and may be raised for the first time\n                                                           on appeal. . . .

The ruling by the trial court, therefore, exceeded its\n\njurisdiction and was an abuse of discretion.\n\nIssue #3: Abuse of Discretion in the Amount of Sanctions\n\n48.                                                        “To determine if the sanctions were appropriate or just, the appellate court\n\nmust ensure there is a direct nexus between the improper conduct and the sanction\n\nimposed. Generally, courts presume that pleadings and other papers are filed in\n\ngood faith. The party seeking sanctions bears the burden of overcoming this\n\npresumption of good faith.” Low v.

In this case, the court did not find a nexus between improper conduct by\n\nRogers and a sanction of $50,000.

The Court must find, therefore, that Casar did not overcome the\n\npresumption of good faith as to Rogers.

The election was held on December 16, 2014 and canvassed on December\n\n     30, 2014. In support of this election contest, Dr. Pressley will respectfully show as follows:\n\n                                               I. Discovery\n\n1.         The contestant intends that discovery be conducted under level three, a custom discovery\n\nplan for election contest devised with the approval of the court.\n\n2.        Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, and the motion set forth below, the plaintiff\n\nrequests that the defendants, within fifteen days of the service of this document, disclose the\n\ninformation and material described in Rule 194.2.\n\n                                              II. Summary\n\n3.        This contest is based on deprivation of voting rights of voters in two high population polling\n\nlocations which were improperly closed, irregularity in votes counted or not counted, and a failure to\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code requirement for storing, retrieval and printing of images of\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                              p.l\n                                                                                                              3\n\fballots cast in electronic voting machines. Travis County uses electronic voting machines from Hart\n\nIntercivic to conduct elections within the county. 1 The result of these multiple irregularities is that\n\nthe result cannot be known, and the Court must order a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such\n\nan election be timely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Election Code and the\n\nSecretary of State's regulations governing elections.\n\n\n                                                 III. Parties\n\n4.          Contestant, Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas. She is a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on December\n\n16, 2014.\n\n5.          Contestee, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas. He was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Casar may be served with process at his principal place ofbusiness, 301 W.\n\n2nd Street, Austin, Texas, 78701.\n\n6.          The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar was declared the\n\nvictor.\n\n7.          A manual recount of all early voting, election day, and provisional cast vote records, and\n\n1\n  Voters in different parts of the state utilize a number of different voting systems, all of which must\nfirst be certified by the Secretary of State. Tex. Elec. Code§ 122.001, .031. ... Once a system is\nThe eSlate, a paperless DRE manufactured by Hart Intercivic, is one of a handful ofDREs the\nSecretary has certified. [6] See Voting              Texas Secretary of State,\nhttp://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/votingsystems.shtml. Voters arriving at the polls in\ncounties using the eSlate are given a unique access code. The voter enters the code into the eSlate,\nwhich then displays the ballot. Voters tum a dial to highlight their ballot choice and then press\n\"enter\" to make a selection. After a voter completes his selections, the eSlate displays a ballot\nsummary page. If the voter's choices are correctly displayed, the voter presses the \"cast ballot\"\nbutton, and the vote is recorded. See Voter Instructions, Travis County,\nhttp://vlww. co. travis. tx. us/county_clerk/election/eS late/pdfs/English_Flyer_ 0 50923. pdf. Travis\nCounty purchased the eSlate system in 2001 and has used it since 2003.\nAndrade v. NAACP ofAustin, 345 S.\\V.3d 1, 4, 5-6 (Tex. 2011) (footnotes omitted.)\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                   p.2\n                                                                                                           4\n\fmailed-in ballots was performed on January 6 2015. 2 The results of the election were unchanged and\n\nMr. Casar remained the victor for the Run Off election and was sworn into office on January 6, 2014.\n\nHe has been notified of the filing of this action by a delivery of a copy of this Petition in accordance\n\nwith TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 21.003(b).\n\n                                      IV. Jurisdiction and Venue\n\n8.        Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                                  V. Facts\n\n9.        City of Austin District 4, comprised of 18 voting precincts, is located entirely in Travis\n\nCounty.\n\nEarly Voting\n\n10.       Early Voting for the Run Off Election for District 4 of the Austin City Council was held on\n\nDecember 1 through December 12, 2014. 3 During Early Voting from December 1 through December\n\nIih, the Travis County Clerk's Office released daily Reports for voters that voted via Ballot By Mail,\n\nand Early Voting.\n\n11.       During Early Voting, many election irregularities occurred. According to Travis Count\n\nElection Division director Michael Winn, no Zero Tapes4 were printed for machines used in Early\n\n\n2\n  Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred\ndid not satisfy statutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a\nstatutory manual recount as defined by the Texas Election Code.\n3\n  In a typical election, election officials create ballots using Ballot Origination Software System\n(\"BOSS\"). The ballot definitions are fed by the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to the eSlates\nattached to it.\n4\n  A \"zero tape\" is run on the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to ensure no votes reside in the\nsystem. When voters arrive they are given a JBC-generated PIN number that they enter on the\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                  p.3\n                                                                                                           5\n\fVoting to verify that prior to the first votes being cast, no votes were pre-registered on the machines. 5\n\nThis failure is in violation of Texas Secretary of State requirements. See Texas Secretary of State\n\n\n\n(last visited 1-29-2014).\n\nElection Day\n\n12.      Election Day was December 16, 2014. Many election irregularities occurred.\n\n13.      Voters seeking to vote at high-volume locations were improperly denied the right to cast\n\ntheir vote. Disenfranchisement of District 4 voters occurred as a result of the closing of the two\n\nhighest volume District 4 voting locations on the Run Off Election Day, December 16, 2014. The\n\nHighland Mall voting location at 6601 Airport Blvd was open during the General Election on\n\nNovember 4, 2014 and saw some of the highest volume of voters in District 4. This location was\n\nclosed for the December Run Off election and was moved to the far less convenient Travis County\n\nTax Office (5501 Airport Blvd). The Pressley campaign received multiple reports of voters being\n\nupset and confused because the voting location had been moved. The second highest voting\n\nprecinct and polling location in District 4 for the November General Election, was Precinct 222 at\n\nCooke Elementary (1511 Cripple Creek). That Precinct is comprised of more than 25% senior\n\nvoters who are 60 years and older. It was closed on Election Day for the December Run Off. It\n\nwas combined with the fourth lowest voter turnout location in District 4, Precinct 268, Grant AME\n\nWorship Center at 1701 Kramer Lane. The Pressley campaign received reports that voters\n\n\neSlate. They then vote and the votes are stored on the eSlate, Mobile Ballot Boxes (MBB), and JBC.\n5\n  Travis County received a waiver of the state requirement for such tapes for the general election\nonly in a letter dated September 30, 2014, based on the burden of the extremely long statewide\nballot. See attached September 30, 2014 letter from Texas Secretary of State.\nThe run-off election ballot includes only City Council and Mayoral candidates. The run-off was\nrestricted to two candidates in the races requiring a run-off, unlike the first round, in which as many\nas twelve candidates participated in some races.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                  p.4\n                                                                                                             6\n\fshowed up to Cooke Elementary for the December Run Off on Election Day and were upset and\n\nconfused and did not subsequently show up to vote at the Kramer location. This is voter\n\ndisenfranchisement of the two most critical, highest volume voting locations in District 4. For\n\nexample, there are 2,971 registered voters in Precinct 222 and only 545 voted in the December\n\n            6\nelection.       This action by the Travis County Clerk had a disproportionate effect on minorities,\n\nworking people, and elderly voters of District 4, which is one of the Hispanic-opportunity districts\n\nin the City of Austin. As a result, some voters registered at those locations were improperly\n\ndenied the right to cast their vote.\n\n14.         No zero tapes were printed at the countywide locations when the polls opened. The\n\nSecretary of State (\"SOS\") has procedures requiring these activities. See Texas Secretary of State\n\nAdvisory 2012-03, 6(g)(vi), httg:/                                                                 (last\n\nvisited 1-29-2014).\n\n15.         On Election Day, no results tapes were printed at the countywide locations when closing\n\nthe polls. The SOS procedures require the printing of closing results tapes, also. Texas Secretary\n\nof State Advisory 2012-03, 6(k)(iii)\n\n(last visited 1-29-2014).\n\n16.         On Election Day, Pressley campaign official poll watchers were denied access to signing\n\nresults tapes at two polling locations, Gus Garcia and Randall's at Research Blvd. This violates\n\nSecreatry of State regulations requiring that poll watchers be allowed to sign such tapes. \"The\n\npresiding election judge, an election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or more\n\nwatchers are present, shall sign the results tape(s).\" Texas Secretary of State Advisory 2012-03,\n\n6(k)(i)                                                                    (last visited 1-29-20 14).\n\n\n6\n    Polling location charts for November and December are attached.\n\n\nPressley v.

On Election Day, Pressley campaign official poll watchers not allowed access at Dobie\n\nMiddle School, where the most important ballots (for the Graham, Gus Garcia, and Virginia\n\nBrown precincts) were placed in transit to central counting. Those boxes were the largest and\n\nstrongest Pressley boxes.\n\n18.      On Election Day, poll watchers were improperly denied access to Central Counting\n\nactivities with Mobile Ballot Boxes (\"MBB\"), Tally activities, and the like. 7\n\nThe Canvass\n\n19.      On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, the Mayor of Austin and the Austin City Council\n\n\n7\n  Hart's eSlate System\nHart's electronic (DRE) voting system is known as eSlate. The eSlate system is comprised of several\ndistinct components.\nThe Ballot Origination Software System (\"BOSS\") is used by election officials to define and create\nindividualized electronic ballots. Data is entered once into BOSS and then flows through all\ncomponents of the eSlate system.\nThe Mobile Ballot Box (\"MBB\") is a reusable, portable flash memory card. It is used to store and\ntransfer election information. When inserted into the Judge's Booth Controller, the MBB supplies\nelection information and ballot styles, it stores an electronic representation of how votes were cast.\nOnce voting has concluded the MBB is removed and its contents are tallied by the Tally software.\nThe Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") is the \"brain\" that manages the system, enabling poll workers\nto know which voting booths are in use at any time. The JBC issues access codes for the voters' use.\nIt can control up to 12 daisy-chained eSlate units.\neSlate refers to the system generally and to the device that voters use to cast ballots, unless using\npaper ballots, in which case Ballot Now is used. The eSlate may be equipped with a disabled access\nunit (\"DAU\") for use by disabled voters. The eSlate units are physically connected to the JBC,\nwhich stores cast-vote records.\nTally is a software application that reads, stores, and tabulates the cast-vote records from the MBB\n(the portable flash card that transferred the cast-vote records from the JBC). Tally tabulates all early\nvoting, absentee, and election day results, and produces various reports.\nRally is a software application that is capable of reading, storing, and transferring cast-vote data\nfrom polling places or collection centers with respect to early returns.\nThe System for Election Records and Verification Operations (\"SERVO\") software is an election\nrecords archiving and asset management system. SERVO is designed to recover data from\nequipment in the case of a lost or damaged MBB. SERVO also is designed for various recount\npurposes.\nBallot Now is a digital-scan paper ballot system that manages the printing, scanning, and resolution\nof mailed-in paper ballots. It also records the electronic cast vote records to an MBB to be read and\ntabulated with Tally.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                             p.6\n                                                                                                           8\n\fconducted an initial official canvass and certification for the Election Day results for all races\n\non the ballot, including City of Austin District 4. The canvassed and certified totals for District\n\n4 were Laura Pressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n20.      Comparison of the canvassed results with the Early Voting voter reports showed\n\ninconsistencies in the results. Travis County reported that 2,651 total voters voted in Early Voting in\n\nDistrict 4. Reviewing the voter ID's, 437 entries existed for those submitting Ballot by Mail (BBM).\n\nThere were at least 28 duplicate entries for BBM. At least 28 mail-in votes appear to have been\n\ncounted twice. See Appendix A.\n\n21.      Once duplicate BBM's were removed, 2,622 voter names remained that voted in Early Voting\n\naccording to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that were distributed prior to Election Day,\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for\n\nGreg Casar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number ofballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. Therefore, there are 79 more ballots than voters for Early Voting. These 79 extra ballots are\n\ndistributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4 Race. (One precinct, with one eligible voter,\n\nshowed no votes.) See Appendix B.\n\n22.      An initial review the 2,622 Early Voting voter names and addresses with returned mail,\n\nabout 14 of the voters had moved or no longer resided in District 4 and were not eligible to vote in\n\nthe District 4 Run Off Election. Therefore, at least 14 ineligible voters cast votes in this contest.\n\nStatistical Improbabilities\n\n23.      A analysis of the voting results show a pattern of mathematical anomalies which is highly\n\nunlikely to occur naturally. For the nine (9) precincts in District 4 with more than 200 voters, the\n\nhighest volume of voters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant received compared to Contestee is\n\nthe same ratio in theN ovember General Election (with a total of 8 candidates) as it was in the\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                                p.7\n                                                                                                           9\n\fDecember Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 35.1% vs 35.0% respectively. In addition, the\n\naverage of the percentages of the unweighted precincts that the Contestant received compared to\n\nContestee, in the November General Election and the December Run Off, are also equal at equal\n\n35.1% and 35.1 %, respectively. No other race in the City is within a lOx such a close non-\n\nvariation, and only two races are within 1OOx such a variation. See Appendix C.\n\n24.      Such a result strongly suggests hardware problems, software problems, procedural issues\n\nor mishandling of machines which may have caused errors in tabulation or reporting.\n\n25.      A similar issue was observed for Early Voting (which typically experiences 1;2 the total\n\nvoting for an election). For the precincts with more than 100 voters, the highest volume of early\n\nvoters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant received compared to Contestee is the same ratio in\n\nthe Early Voting in the November General Election (with a total of8 candidates) as it was in the\n\nEarly Voting in the December Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 36.7% vs 36.7% respectively.\n\nAgain, no other race in the City is within a 1Ox such a close non-variation, and only two races are\n\nwithin lOOx such a variation. See Appendix D.\n\n26.      Such a result strongly suggests hardware problems, software problems, procedural issues\n\nor mishandling of machines which may have caused errors in tabulation or reporting.\n\n27.      Contestant is concerned there may have been some hardware issues, software\n\nmalfunctions or mishandling that may have caused errors in the tabulation of the results.\n\nAdditionally, some number of ineligible voters appear to have cast votes.\n\nThe Recount\n\n28.      Given the highly improbable statistical anomalies, the duplicate Ballot by Mail entries,\n\nand that there are more ballots than number of voters for Early Voting (overvotes), Contestant\n\nrequested a manual recount of the District 4 Election with the goal of reconciling the\n\n\nPressley v. Casar OP Contest                                                             p.8\n                                                                                                      10\n\fdiscrepancies.\n\n29.      On January 4, 2015, the Mayor of Austin and City Clerk approved Contestant's\n\namended petition requesting a manual recount of actual stored balloting System. Contestant's\n\namended petition included a request to reconcile the ballots cast with the number of voters documented\n\non the sign in sheets and combination forms for District 4 for the countywide polling locations and\n\nPrecincts to ensure accurate reporting of results. The number of voters recorded and the number of votes\n\nrecorded did not match.\n\n30.      On January 5, 2015, prior to the Recount, Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 213.016,\n\n\"PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING ELECTRONIC\n\nVOTING MACHINES,\" Dr. Pressley communicated over the phone with the Director of Travis\n\nCounty Elections Division. Pressley informed the Director that she desired to be present during\n\nthe printing of images of ballots cast. \"Each candidate is entitled to be present and to have\n\nrepresentatives present in the same number as prescribed by Section 213.013(b) for a recount\n\nduring the printing of the images.\" An email was sent to The Travis County Clerk and copied to\n\nthe Texas Secretary of State's Office, to the same effect.\n\n31.      On January 6, 2015, a manual recount was conducted and additional irregularities ensued\n\nwith regard to and during the recount.\n\nNo Ballot images\n\n32.      On Tuesday, January 6, 2015, at 11 :OOam when the recount was to begin, the Travis\n\nCounty Clerk and the Recount Committee relayed to Contestant and her official recount watcher,\n\nKaren Renick, the images of ballots cast were not available, would not be printed, and would not\n\n\n\n\nPressley v.

Failure to print images of\n\nballots violates this provision of the election code.\n\nPrinting errors\n\n33.        Prior to the start of the Recount, Travis County selected the data files to print and pre-\n\nprint an aggregated data file of Cast Vote Records (CVR's). The pre-printed CVR's contained a\n\nsubset of the data that a District 4 ballot contains. Upon starting the recount on January 6, 2014\n\naround 11 :OOam, Contestant relayed to the Travis County Clerk and the Recount Committee, that\n\nthe lack of providing printed images ofballots cast were a violation of TEX. ELEC. CODE§\n\n213.016.\n\n34.        Cast Vote Records are not \"images ofballots cast.\" Ballots are defined in Texas Election\n\nCode Chapter 52, Subchapter C. 9 Section 52.075 of the Subchapter also allows the Secretary of\n\n\n\n8\n  See attached Affidavit of Karen Renick\n9\n  For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that subchapter are Sec. 52.003 and Sec.\n52.070.\nSec. 52.003.

At the same meeting, Dr. Pressley stated that the pre-printing of recount records and\n\nstarting the recount process was also a violation of213.016 and 213.009(c), respectively. A\n\nmember of the recount committee responded to one of the recount watchers: \"They started all this\n\non Sunday [January 4, 2015].\"\n\n36.      Pressley warned the County Clerk that the irregularities, of not printing the images of\n\nballots cast, were in violation of the approved amended Petition for Recount and the CODE and\n\nwas grounds for an Incident Report. Printing the CVR data files were in essence, reprinting the\n\nprevious results obtained on Election night. A CVR is essentially nothing more than a tally sheet-\n\nit does not \"count\" the images of ballots- it merely reprints the tally. It was not recounting the\n\nsource data of the images of the ballots cast, and as such it is not a meaningful check on the\n\noriginal count. 10 Using the CVR instead of ballot image also appears to violate Texas Election\n\n\nname.\"\n\n(e) A square shall be printed to the left of each line provided for write-in voting under Section\n52.066(c), but failure to place a mark in the square does not affect the counting of a write-in vote.\n(emphasis added.)\n10\n   Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (Dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.) In its 2014 Electronic Voting System\nProcedures bulletin, posted online at\n                            the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot\nimages. See, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8 - Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEC § 214.071):\n1.

Poll lists were not\n\napparently reviewed by the Recount Committee during the recount. Dr. Pressley requested the\n\npoll lists to be reviewed and the number voters per precinct be reconciled with those documented\n\non the polling location combination sign-in forms. Pressley requested those numbers be\n\nreconciled with the recount results, because of Early Voting voter lists discrepancies identified in\n\nthe Recount Petition. The request was denied by the Travis County Clerk, the Chair of the\n\nRecount Committee, and the Director of Travis County Elections. The request was also\n\nspecifically made prior to the recount in the Amended Petition for Recount.\n\n40.      Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 213.012, the committee chair prepared a report of the\n\nvote count. The chair wrote \"The numbers of voters matched the number of ballots cast,\" and\n\nsigned the report. During the Recount, the numbers of voters on voter lists were not reconciled\n\nwith the ballots recounted by the chair.\n\n41.      On January 6, 2015, the recount was conducted and completed. After the recount, the\n\ntotals were unchanged as compared to the original canvassed results. The totals were Laura\n\nPressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n42.      Reconciliation of voter signatures on rolls at polling locations and total ballots cast has\n\nnot been completed. An election contest is the only available remedy to explore the discrepancy\n\nbetween the the number of ballots counted and the number voter names and signatures in the\n\nprecincts.\n\n43.

The sum total of those voting irregularities exceeds the number of votes by which the\n\nelection was decided.\n\n45.      Because no images ofballots cast can be retrieved, printed and count, Travis County\n\ncannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and the election is void.

On Tuesday, December 30th, the Mayor and City Council of Austin conducted an official\n\ncanvass and certification of the Run Off results for all races on the December 16, 2014 ballot,\n\nincluding District 4. However a recount was conducted on January 6, 2015 and those results did\n\nnot change. The deadline for submission of a petition in an election contest is January 29, 2015.\n\nTherefore, this petition is timely filed.\n\n                                    VII.

Contestants further requests that the Court sign an order requiring that Contestee's\n\nresponse to the request for disclosure, and all other responses and answers in this case be hand-\n\ndelivered, faxed or emailed.\n\n52.      The foregoing modifications to standard discovery procedures are necessary because of\n\nthe accelerated procedures that apply to this primary election contest. For example, the trial\n\nwould be over before the disclosures and documents were due if the standard discovery deadlines\n\nremain applicable. The foregoing reasons constitute good cause for the requested relief.\n\n                                   REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION\n\n53.      Contestant requests that the Travis County produce promptly for inspection and copying,\n\nall voter sign-in sheets of the City of Austin election, December 16, 2014, including early voting\n\nsign-in sheets.\n\n54.      Contestant requests that Travis County produce promptly for inspection and copying, all\n\nvoter registration records, including but not limited to voter registration cards, that were validly\n\naccepted in the City of Austin, Texas, District 4, as of the date of the election, December 16,\n\n2014.\n\n55.

In support of this election contest, Dr. Pressley will respectfully\n\n     show as follows:\n\n                                             I. DISCOVERY\n\n1.        The contestant intends that discovery be conducted under level three, a custom discovery\n\nplan for election contest devised with the approval of the court.\n\n                                  II. REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE\n\n2.        Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, and the motion set forth below, the plaintiff\n\nrequests that the defendants, within thirty days of the service of the Original Petition, disclose the\n\ninformation and material described in Rule 194.2.\n\n                                             III. SUMMARY\n\n3.         This contest is based on the facts that illegal votes were counted, election officers prevented\n\neligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal votes, and election officers made\n\nmistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true outcome. Thus, deprivation of\n\nvoting rights of voters in several high population polling locations which were improperly closed,\n\nirregularity in votes counted or not counted, and a failure to comply with the Texas Election Code\n\nrequirement for storing, retrieval and printing of \"images of ballots cast\" in electronic voting\n\nmachines occurred and negatively affected the outcome for Pressley. Particularly, the improper\n\nclosure, consolidation and moving of the voting locations alone appears to have reduced the vote\n\nconsiderably more than the margin reported in the canvass of the election. 2\n\n4.        Additionally, Travis County uses electronic voting machines from Hart Intercivic to conduct\n\n\n\n2This is sufficient to \"materially affect[] the election results.\" Gonzalez v.

ELEC. CODE\n\n§213.016). Without these statutorily-required \"images of ballots cast\" it is impossible for the Court\n\nto determine the actual election outcome, as the only actual ballots - the mail-in ballots - are exactly\n\nand perfectly tied between the two candidates. The Travis County Clerk has asserted that the system\n\nTravis County uses cannot print \"images of ballots cast.\" Images of ballots cast\" is not the same as\n\n\"cast vote records.\" The Court, consequently, must reject any \"cast vote records\" produced and\n\ntallied by such machines. The result of these multiple irregularities is that the result cannot be\n\nknown, and the Court must order a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such an election be\n\ntimely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Election Code and the Secretary of State's\n\nregulations governing elections.\n\n5.     \"The purpose of the election code is to ensure that the true will of the voters is 'fairly expressed'\n\nand that the evidence of that expression is 'properly preserved.'

While some actual ballots were preserved - the mail-in ballots, in which the candidates are\n\nperfectly tied - the vast majority of ballots and the evidence of the voters' intent were not preserved.\n\nAccording to the Travis County Clerk, there are no \"images of ballots cast\" that the court can\n\nreview.

Contestant Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis County,\n\nTexas. She was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on December 16,\n\n2014.\n\n8.        Contestee Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas.      He was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on\n\nDecember 16,2014. Casar has been served and has answered in this cause.\n\n9.        The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar was declared the\n\nvictor.\n\n10.       A \"manual recount\" of all early voting, election day, provisional, and mailed-in ballots was\n\nattempted on January 6, 2015. 6 The mail-in ballots were exactly tied between the candidates, at 240\n\n\n\n5 The requirement to preserve \"images of ballots cast\" in the statute is fundamental to preserving the\nevidence of the will of the voters. By failing to preserve that evidence, the County has destroyed\nevidence of the expression of the will of the voters and forced the court to call a new election.\n6 Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.4\n                                                                                                           342\n\feach, for a total of 480 votes. 7 The attempted recount was a nullity and a real recount was made\n\nimpossible in that the attempted recount violated state law and was incorrectly performed using of the\n\n\"cast vote records\" in lieu of \"images of ballots cast\" combined with the actual mail in ballots. Based\n\non the counting of \"cast vote records\" and mail in ballots, as could be predicted, the invalid recount did\n\nnot change the reported results of the election and the original declaration of Mr. Casar as the victor for\n\nthe run off election did not change. Casar was sworn into office on January 6, 2014.         He has been\n\nnotified of the filing of this action by a delivery of a copy of this Petition in accordance with TEX.\n\nELEC. CODE § 21.003(b).\n\n                                 V. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n11.     Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                               VI. FACTS\n\n            Travis County Election Officials Prevented Eligible Voters from Voting\n\n12.     City of Austin District 4, comprised of 18 voting precincts, is located entirely in Travis\n\nCounty. Early Voting and Election Day was December 1-12, and 16, 2014, respectively.               Voters\n\nseeking to vote at high-volume locations were improperly denied the right to cast their vote.\n\nDisenfranchisement of District 4 voters occurred as a result of the closing of the highest volume\n\nDistrict 4 voting locations in the Run Off during Early Voting and Election Day, December 16,\n\n\ndid not satisfy statutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a\nstatutory manual recount as defined by the Texas Election Code.\n7 These were the only actual ballots counted during the \"manual recount.\" The mail-in ballots were\nmore than 10% of the total ballots cast in the election. The allegation of the county is that, despite\nthe perfect tie in mail-in ballots, Casar beat Pressley by a 2-to-1 margin in the remaining ballots.\nThis is a variation in election results that is highly improbable and unrecorded to Contestant's\nknowledge.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                   p.5\n                                                                                                              343\n\f2014.\n\n13.     The Highland Mall voting location at 6601 Airport Blvd was open during the General\n\nElection for Early Voting and Election Day on October 20-31, and November 4, 2014,\n\nrespectively and saw some of the highest volume of voters in District 4. This location was the\n\ndesignated voting location for Precinct 142 and was an important and convenient voting location\n\nfor Precinct 156 and others nearby. It was closed for the December Run Off election for Early\n\nVoting and Election Day. It was moved to the far less convenient Travis County Tax Office at\n\n5501 Airport Blvd (See Appendix 1). The Pressley campaign received multiple reports of voters\n\nbeing upset and confused because the voting location had been moved.\n\n14.     Specifically, reports were received by Contestant on Election Day, December 16th , from\n\nvoters while Contestant was phone banking. District 4 voter, Thomas Crawford showed up at\n\nCooke Elementary to vote, and reported no signs were posted to indicate where the polling\n\nlocation had been moved. Similar reports were received by Brad Parsons, a campaign volunteer,\n\nwho was phone banking on Election Day. Campaign supporter, Matthew Palmer reported that\n\nHighland Mall was closed and it was a problem for voters.        Based on information and belief,\n\nContestant asserts that said confusion was a result of failure to post, or premature removal of, a\n\nnotice at Cooke Elementary, Precinct 222, of the relocation of the polling place.\n\n15.     Upon reviewing voter rolls for Pct 156 and 142, published by Travis County, Appendix 2\n\nshows names, addresses and precincts of 365 voters of Pcts 156 and 142 that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 365 voters were identified based on their voting histories which include\n\nbut are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary\n\nElections. The extensive voting histories of these 365 voters show they are the most consistent\n\nvoters in Precincts 142 and 156 and surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                           p.6\n                                                                                                     344\n\fin 2014.   In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters, multiple times, as very\n\nstrong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs posted), who were waiting\n\nto vote on Election Day. These voters total 73. Therefore, Contestant alleges a total of 438 voters\n\nin Precincts 142 and 156 were disenfranchised.\n\n16.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (detailed voter information of\n\nprecincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting in the General and\n\nRun off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County. Upon receipt and\n\nreview of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify additional voters and\n\nimprove the accuracy of this list.    Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of collecting\n\naffidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n17.    The second highest voting precinct and polling location in District 4 for the November\n\nGeneral Election was Precinct 222 at Cooke Elementary located at 1511 Cripple Creek. That\n\nPrecinct is comprised of more than 25% senior voters who are 60 years and older. It was closed\n\nduring Election Day for the December Run Off (See Appendix 1). It was combined with the\n\nfourth lowest voter turnout location in District 4, Precinct 268, Grant AME Worship Center at\n\n1701 Kramer Lane.\n\n18.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Rob Hale, a resident and voter in Pct 222.\n\nAs usual, he and other Pct 222 voters showed up to Cooke Elementary for the December Run Off\n\non Election Day and were confused as to why Cooke Elementary was closed for voting for Pct\n\n222. He helped senior voters look up an alternative location in which to vote on Kramer Lane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Kramer location, he waited for the senior voters and they did not arrive. In\n\naddition, he had a relative that showed up at Cooke Elementary to vote, and the relative reported\n\nno signs were posted to indicate where the polling location had been moved.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.7\n                                                                                                       345\n\f19.    Upon reviewing Pct 222 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 3 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 248 voters that we allege were disenfranchised. These 248 voters have\n\nvoting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin\n\nCouncil Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 248 voters show\n\nthey are the most consistent voters in Precinct 222 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City\n\nCouncil Run off election in 2014.     In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters,\n\nmultiple times, as very strong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs\n\nposted), which were waiting to vote on Election Day. These voters total 71. Therefore, Contestant\n\nalleges a total of319 voters in Precinct 222 alone were disenfranchised.\n\n20.

Another voting location open during the General Election but closed for the District 4 Run\n\noff was Precinct 133, which was open for the General Election at Blanton Elementary located at\n\n5408 Westminster. It was combined with the non-District 4 Precinct 130, at Memorial UMC.\n\n22.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Pct 133, Election Judge, Arthur Turner, a\n\nresident and voter in Pct 133. During Election Day, voters from Pct 133, showed up at Blanton\n\nElementary to vote in the Run Off and were confused and upset as to why Blanton Elementary was\n\nclosed for voting for Pct 133. Mr. Turner had multiple calls from upset voters who did not know\n\nwhere to vote.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.8\n                                                                                                         346\n\f23.    Upon reviewing Pct 133 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 4 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 116 voters Contestant alleges were disenfranchised. These 116 voters\n\nhave voting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of\n\nAustin Council Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 116\n\nvoters show they are the most consistent voters in Precinct 133 and they surprisingly did not vote\n\nin the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n24.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (such as detailed voter\n\ninformation such as precincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting\n\nin the General and Run off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County.\n\nUpon receipt and review of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify\n\nadditional voters and improve the accuracy of this list. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process\n\nof collecting affidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n25.    Three additional polling locations were closed for the Run off election for District 4 (Pcts\n\n209, 258, and 260).     Upon reviewing the voter rolls for these precincts published by Travis\n\nCounty, Appendix 5 shows names, addresses and precincts of 235 voters that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 235 voters have voting histories which include but are not limited to\n\nvoting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary Elections.             The\n\nextensive voting histories of these 235 voters show they are the most consistent voters in Precincts\n\n209,258, and 260 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n26.    The total number of closed/moved/combined precincts in District 4 for the Run off comes\n\nto a total of 7 Precincts out of 17 voting precincts in District 4. Therefore, 41 % of District 4's\n\npolling locations were closed, combined or moved for the December Austin City Council Run off.\n\nAppendix 6. This caused a much lower than expected turnout for Election Day for District 4.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.9\n                                                                                                         347\n\f27.    To summarize, typically Election Day and Early Voting tum out is very similar. Early\n\nVoting for the District 4 Run Off race saw approximately 2,646 voters and on Election Day only\n\n1,771 turned out. Due closing/ moving/ combining of 41 % of District 4 Polling locations, voters\n\nwere confused and disenfranchised and Election Day voters were about 875 short.\n\n28.    The County's actions of closing multiple, key, high volume polling locations had a\n\ndisproportionate effect on minorities, working people, and elderly voters of District 4-one of the\n\nHispanic-opportunity districts in the City of Austin.        Four of Pressley's strongest voting\n\nlocations/boxes that showed over 50% for Pressley (222, 156, 133, 258), as evidenced by the only\n\nremaining ballots, Mail in Ballot results, were moved or closed for the Run Off election (See\n\nAppendix 6).\n\n\n\n29.    As a result of these aggressive and improper closures, voters registered at those locations\n\nwere improperly denied the right to cast their vote. The closure of these pro-Pressley precincts was\n\nunfair and undermined the true outcome of the election. A conservative count of disenfranchised\n\nvoters resulting from the improper closure/moving/combining of precincts 133, 142, 156, 209,\n\n222, 258, and 260 is 1,108. This value is consistent with the ]ow voter turnout on Election\n\nDay as compared to Early Voting. Upon evaluation of discovery responses from Travis County,\n\na more accurate number may be provided. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of obtaining\n\ntestimony regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n\n\nTravis County Ejection Officials Allowed Ineligible Voters to Cast Votes (Illegal Votes)\n\n30.

A\n\nmore detailed review of the voter registrar information provided by Travis County is needed with\n\nregard to Provisional Ballots, statements of residence, etc. Upon evaluation of Discovery\n\nresponses from Travis County, a more accurate number may be provided. A list of the 64 voter's\n\nVoter ID's and precincts are found in Appendix 7.\n\n31.    \\Vith regard to additional categories for illegal votes, it is unlikely that voters that are not\n\ninterested in voting in a General Election will be interested in voting in a Run Off election. After\n\nreviewing Travis County voter rolls (https:lltax-office.traviscountytx.gov/voter-data), for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off, 156 voters voted in the Run Off that did not vote in the General\n\nElection. Many are Ballot by Mails and a large number voted at specific locations. These are\n\npotentially illegal votes and we ask the court to allow Contestant time to review and evaluate\n\nvarious Discovery responses from Travis County voting records including, but not limited to,\n\nBallot by Mail, voter registration cards, polling location sign in sheets, and residency records, etc.\n\nto validate the votes were cast legally. A List of these voters are found in Appendix 8.\n\n                 More Ballots Than Voters During Early Voting (IHega} Votes)\n\n32.    On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, the Mayor of Austin and the Austin City Council\n\nconducted an initial official canvass and certification for the Election Day results for all races\n\non the ballot, including City of Austin District 4. The canvassed and certified totals for District\n\n4 were Laura Pressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n33.    The canvassed results were inconsistent with the Early Voting voter reports. Travis County\n\nreported that 2,651 total voters voted in Early Voting in District 4. Reviewing the voter ID's, 437\n\n\n\nPressley v.

There were at least 28 duplicate entries for\n\nBBM. At least 28 mail-in votes appear to have been counted twice or three times. See Appendix 6,\n\nDuplicate Ballot by Mail Entries.\n\n34.     Once duplicate BBM's were removed, 2,622 voter names remained that voted in Early Voting\n\naccording to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that were distributed prior to Election Day,\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for\n\nGreg Casar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number of ballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. Therefore, there are 80 more ballots than voters for Early Voting. These 80 extra ballots are\n\ndistributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4 Race. 8 (One precinct, with one eligible voter,\n\nshowed no votes.) See Appendix 7, Early Voting Discrepancies.\n\n                                      Statistical Improbabilities\n\n35.    An analysis of the voting results show a pattern of mathematical anomalies which is highly\n\nunlikely to occur naturally. (See Appendix 8, pages 1-3.) For the nine (9) precincts in District 4\n\nwith more than 200 voters,9 the highest volume of voters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant\n\nreceived compared to Contestee is the same ratio in the November General Election (with a total\n\nof 8 candidates) as it was in the December Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 35.1 % vs 35.0%\n\nrespectively.   In addition, the average of the percentages of the unweighted precincts that the\n\nContestant received compared to Contestee, in the November General Election and the December\n\nRun Off, are also equal at 35.1 % and 35.1 %, respectively. No other Council race in the history of\n\nelectronic voting in the City (2003 - current) has shown such a tight non-variation between a\n\n\n8 In the original petition, this number was identified as 79. One precinct, 211, had a single vote\nundervote. See Appendix 7, Early Voting Discrepancies.\" Additionally, there are an unknown\nnumber of ballot by mail overvotes, invalid voter registrations, ineligible voters and election day\novervotes.\n9 These precincts account for more than 80% of the vote in the District.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.12\n                                                                                                             350\n\fgeneral election and a run off.

See\n\nattached Appendix 8, Comparison of Election Returns.\n\n36.     The fact that so many precincts showed exactly the same and unchanged results for the General\n\nElection and the Run Off is indicative of mistakes made by Travis County election officers. These\n\nmistakes are likely related to and are due to, but not limited to, the handling of voter hardware,\n\nsoftware, etc.\n\n37.         From Travis County Voter Rolls, though over 4,000 voters were different between the\n\nGeneral and Run Off elections, the unique and unlikely occurrence that the results remain unchanged\n\nand which has not occurred in the last 11 years in Travis County for any other Run Off candidate or\n\nelection is highly improbable. The occurrence is surprising, is strictly isolated to District 4, and is\n\nindicative of human error. Because so many high volume District 4 precincts showed exactly the same\n\npercentage results for Pressley and Casar, it is possible that some memory cards or counting software\n\nused in the General Election were mistakenly reused in error for the Run Off.\n\n38.         Contestee Casar alleges the factual and statistically improbable election results for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off \"are unsurprising.\" This is indicative of emotional wishful thinking\n\nrather than a clear-eyed analytical assessment of evidence and data. Additionally, Casar offers vague\n\nand irrelevant references and personal attacks from a politically biased news source, the far-left Austin\n\nChronicle. The Chronicle endorsed and directly campaigned for Contestee Casar. Additionally, the\n\nChronicle has little to no scientific expertise on statf that is qualified to offer expert testimony on\n\ncomplex topics of mathematics, chemistry, physics and engineering, which they attempt to report and\n\ncritique.\n\n39.

Several election safeguards and procedures defined by the Legislature and the Secretary of\n\nState that are intended to prevent human errors were mistakenly not followed by Travis County. The\n\nmistakes and failure to adhere to the Secretary of State's procedures led to and caused illegal votes to be\n\ncounted.\n\n41.        With regard to the counting of illegal votes, during Early and Election Day Voting, many\n\nelection irregularities occurred and mistakes were made by Travis County election officers.\n\nAccording to Travis County Election Division director Michael \\Vinn, no Zero Tapes 10 were printed\n\nfor machines to verify that directly prior to the first votes being cast, no votes were pre-registered on\n\n\n10 A \"zero tape\" is run on the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to ensure no votes reside in the\n\nsystem.

The eSlate system is comprised of several\ndistinct components.\nThe Ballot Origination Software System (\"BOSS\") is used by election officials to define and create\nindividualized electronic ballots. Data is entered once into BOSS and then flows through all\ncomponents of the eSlate system.\nThe Mobile Ballot Box (\"MBB\") is a reusable, portable flash memory card. It is used to store and\ntransfer election information. When inserted into the Judge's Booth Controller, the MBB supplies\nelection information and ballot styles, it stores an electronic representation of how votes were cast.\nOnce voting has concluded the MBB is removed and its contents are tallied by the Tally software.\nThe Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") is the \"brain\" that manages the system, enabling poll workers\nto know which voting booths are in use at any time. The JBC issues access codes for the voters' use.\nIt can control up to 12 daisy-chained eSlate units.\neSlate refers to the system generally and to the device that voters use to cast ballots, unless using\npaper ballots, in which case Ballot Now is used. The eSlate may be equipped with a disabled access\nunit (\"DAU\") for use by disabled voters. The eSlate units are physically connected to the JBC,\nwhich stores cast-vote records.\nTally is a software application that reads, stores, and tabulates the cast-vote records from the MBB\n(the portable flash card that transferred the cast-vote records from the JBC). Tally tabulates all early\nvoting, absentee, and election day results, and produces various reports.\nRally is a software application that is capable of reading, storing, and transferring cast-vote data\nfrom polling places or collection centers with respect to early returns.\nThe System for Election Records and Verification Operations (\"SERVO\") software is an election\nrecords archiving and asset management system. SERVO is designed to recover data from\nequipment in the case of a lost or damaged MBB.

Because of the previously noted, highly improbable statistical anomalies l3 , the duplicate\n\nBallot by Mail entries, and the fact that there are more ballots than number of voters for Early\n\nVoting (overvotes), Contestant requested a manual recount of the District 4 Election with the goal\n\nof reconciling the discrepancies.\n\n48.        Contestant claims the recount evidence and findings are critically material to this case\n\nand the allegations are legally relevant to this election contest.\n\n49.    The recount failed to only count legal votes because \"images of ballots cast\" were not\n\nprovided and counted.      Printing the \"cast vote record\" or \"CVR\" data files was in essence\n\nreprinting the previous electronically counted results obtained on Election night. A CVR prints\n\ndata from a data file to a template; it does not count the \"images of ballots cast\" - it merely\n\nreprints the tally on separate sheets of paper. It was not recounting the source data of the \"images\n\nof ballots cast,\" and as such it is not a meaningful check on the original count. 14 Using the CVR\n\n\n13 See Appendix 8.\n14 The Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (All dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.) In its 2014 Electronic Voting System\nProcedures bulletin, posted online at\n                           the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot\nimages.

Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.012, the committee chair prepared a report of the vote\n\ncount. The Travis County Clerk and the Director of the Elections Division repeatedly informed\n\nDr. Pressley that \"it was not the scope of the Recount\" to reconcile the ballots with the number of\n\nvoters. The chair wrote, \"The numbers of voters matched the number of ballots cast,\" and signed\n\nthe report (See Attached Appendix 14, \"Recount Affidavit of Jay Brim\"). During the Recount, the\n\nnumbers of voters on voter lists were not publicly reconciled with the ballots recounted by the\n\nchair.   Dr. Pressley commented to the chair, \"Matching the numbers was not supposedly done\n\ntoday,\" and no explanation was provided by the chair.\n\n62.      On January 5, 2015, the Mayor of Austin and City Clerk approved Contestant's amended\n\npetition requesting a manual recount of actual stored \"images ofballois cast.,,19 Contestant's amended\n\npetition included a request to reconcile the ballots cast with the number of voters documented on the sign\n\nin sheets and combination fomls for District 4 for the countywide polling locations and Precincts to\n\nensure accurate reporting of results. The number of voters recorded and the number of votes recorded\n\ndid not match.\n\n         Ballot by Mail Ballots Are The Only Legal Ballots That Are Properly Preserved\n\n63.       This is why printing the \"images of the ballots cast\" is critical. The ballot in the General\n\nElection was very different (8 candidates) from the ballot in the Run Off (2 candidates). If some\n\nmemory cards or counting software were reused by mistake, then the \"images of the ballots cast\" will\n\ninstantly and unmistakably distinguish the true votes from the illegal votes. This is the intent of the\n\n19 Texas Election Code §213.016.\nSec. 213.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING\nELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES. During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct\nrecording electronic voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\nrequired to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many committee members\nmust be present during the printing of the images. Each candidate is entitled to be present and to\nhave representatives present in the same number as prescribed by Section 213.0 13(b) for a recount\nduring the printing of the images.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.24\n                                                                                                             362\n\f\"images of ballots cast\" language of the law. Which ballots were counted is the question that can be\n\nanswered only by review of the \"images of ballots cast.\"\n\n64.       The mandatory nature of this requirement becomes clear in context.\n\n          [W]e believe that violations of certain recording provisions by election clerks can\n          certainly undermine the purpose of the election code and obscure the true will of the\n          qualified voters.\n\nGonzalez v. Villareal, 251 S.W.3d at 778\n\n65.       Failure to retain \"image of ballots cast,\" \"ballots\" and or \"ballot originals\" is precisely such\n\na violation, because there is no clear and unequivocal record of the voter's intent, absent such an\n\nImage.\n\n66.          Given the facts and the election mistakes made by Travis County election officers, all of the\n\n4,023 votes that show to be cast in person, are in question and must be verified. Therefore, we ask the\n\nCourt to compel Travis County to print and tally the \"images of ballots cast\" for the District 4 Run Off\n\nso the court may ascertain whether the outcome as shown by the canvass is not the tme outcome\n\nbecause illegal votes were counted. The list of the 4,023 voters and their Voter ID' s are provided in\n\nAppendix 15.\n\n67.       The recount included the Ballot by Mail ballots, and those specific results for Pressley and\n\nCasar were determined. 20 Ballot by Mail Votes were cast in seventeen of the eighteen precincts of\n\nDistrict 4. 21 Pressley received 240 votes and Casar received 240 votes of the 480 total votes cast\n\nfor either candidate for the Ballot by Mail ballots. Pressley received exactly 50% of the votes.\n\n68.       The Ballot by Mail result is very different from the 33.3 and 33.8% Pressley is reported to\n\nha ve received for early voting and election day voting from the \"cast vote records\" - a variation\n\nfrom mail-in votes and non-mail-in votes of almost 20% (See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount\n\n20   See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount Results.\"\n21   One precinct, with a population of a single voter, showed no votes.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.25\n                                                                                                             363\n\fResults\").\n\n69.    The only actual \"ballots\" that were preserved and counted during the recount show\n\nPressley and Casar split the vote exactly in half. Moreover, 10 of the 18 precincts showed 50% or\n\nmore of the vote for Pressley. The Ballot by Mail ballots that were cast for either candidate (total\n\nof 480 votes) were over 10% of the total ballots cast for the Run Off election.\n\n70.          The 480 Ballot by Mail ballots are the only\" ballots,\" as that term is defined in the\n\nElection Code, which were available and counted during the recount.            Therefore, the election\n\nshould have been re-canvassed only with the 480 Ballot by Mail \"ballots\" and not the results\n\nincluding the 4,023 illegally recounted \"cast vote records.\"\n\n71.    This is an additional reason for the court to compel the Travis County Clerk to comply with\n\nTEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.016 22 and 214.049 (e?3 to print and count the statutorily required \"images\n\nof ballots cast\" and ascertain whether the previous outcome of the election is not the true outcome.\n\n72.    On January 6, 2015, the recount was conducted and completed. After the recount, the\n\ntotals were unchanged as compared to the original canvassed results.           The totals were Laura\n\nPressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n73.    Reconciliation of voter signatures on rolls at polling locations and total ballots cast has not\n\nbeen completed. An election contest is the only available remedy to explore the discrepancy\n\nbetween the number of ballots counted and the number of voter names and signatures in the\n\nprecincts.\n\n74.    The sum total of all voting irregularities identified herein exceeds the number of votes by\n\n\n\n22 \"PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING ELECTRONIC\nVOTING MACHINES\"\n23\"If electronic voting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original ballot, rather than\nthe duplicate of the original ballot, shall be counted.\"\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.26\n                                                                                                         364\n\fwhich the election was decided.\n\n75.     If no \"images of ballots cast\" can be retrieved, printed and counted, Travis County cannot\n\nunequivocally determine the outcome of the election. The Court may order each of the more than\n\n4,000 voters who voted in person to testify as to how they voted, pursuant to Texas Election Code\n\nSec. 221.010. \"SECONDARY            EVIDENCE        FOR UNAVAILABLE              BALLOTS.

In the alternative, if Travis County cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\" to be printed\n\nand counted, then Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and\n\nthe election is void. As a matter oflaw, the Court must therefore order a new election. TEX. ELEC.\n\nCODE § 232.041. 24\n\n                                 VII. PETITION TIMELY FILED\n\n77.

VIOLATIONS OF LAW\n\n Texas Election Code Violation\n\n Lack of Notice of Relocation of Polling Place\n\n 82.    The facts asserted above are included herein by reference. Contestant claims that voters\n\n were disenfranchised due to the failure of Travis County to provide and/or maintain an adequate\n\n notice at the general election polling place (Highland Mall and other voting locations identified\n\n herein) detailing the relocation of the polling place to the Travis County offices for the runoff\n\n election in December 2014. Such failure to provide notice of relocation of the polling place for\n\n the runoff election is a violation of Texas Election Code § 43.062. Section 43.062 states:\n\n       Sec. 43.062. NOTICE AT PREVIOUS POLLING PLACE. If the location of the\n       polling place for an election precinct is different from the location used for the\n       precinct in the preceding election ordered by the same authority, the authority\n       responsible for giving notice of the election shall, if possible, post notice at the\n       entrance to the previous polling place stating that the location has changed and\n       providing the location of the new polling place.\n\n       Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 802, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1,2001.\n\n Contestant seeks an order requiring a vacation of the runoff election and an order requiring a\n\n properly noticed runoff election be held forthwith.\n\n\n\nFailure to Provide \"Images of Ballots Cast\"\n\n83.     Contestant asserts that the December 2014 runoff fails to comply with the statutory\n\nrequirements of the Texas Election Code Chapters 128 and 213. Section 128.001 states:\n\n       Sec. 128.001. COMPUTERIZED VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.28\n                                                                                                     366\n\f       (a) The secretary of state shall prescribe procedures to allow for the use of a\n       computerized voting system. The procedures must provide for the use of a\n       computerized voting system with:\n             (1) multiple voting terminals for the input of vote selections on the ballot\n             presented by a main computer; and\n             (2) a main computer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection,\n             ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\n\n\n84.    Section 2l3.016 states:\n\n       Sec. 2l3.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT\n       RECORDING ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES.\n\n       During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct recording electronic\n       voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\n       required to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many\n       committee members must be present during the printing of the images. Each\n       candidate is entitled to be present and to have representatives present during the\n       printing of the images in the same number as Section 2l3.0l3(b) prescribes for\n       watchers for a recount.\n\n       Added by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 583, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1,2003.\n       Amended by:\n               Acts 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., Ch. 1235 (S.B. 1970), Sec. 22, eff. September\n       1,2009.\n\n\n 85.    As asserted above, the Travis County Clerk cannot provide \"images of ballots cast\" for\n\n purposes of a recount in the December runoff election as required by the Texas Election Code.\n\n Because the Travis County Clerk cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\", the ballots cast on the\n\n electronic voting machines cannot be verified. Contestant seeks an order from this case vacating\n\n the December 2014 runoff election. Since the only verifiable votes in the December runoff are\n\n the ballots by mail, said votes resulting in a tie in the runoff, Contestant seeks an order from this\n\n Court directing that another runoff election be conducted and that the Travis County Clerk\n\n provide \"images of ballots cast\" in such a runoff election for purposes of allowing all affected\n\n parties to verify the results of said runoff in compliance with the above-referenced provisions of\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.29\n                                                                                                         367\n\f the Texas Election Code.\n\n\n\n Violation ofSection 2 of the Federal Voting Rights Act\n\n 86.    Contestant asserts that failure to provide notice at the general election polling place of the\n\n relocation of the polling place for the runoff has a disproportionate impact on minority voters in\n\n violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 42 U.S.c. §§ 1973b(f), 1973l(c)(3» (now 52\n\n USC 10303) bars voting discrimination against certain language minorities--specifically, persons\n\n of American Indian, Asian American, Native Alaskan, and Spanish heritage. Members of the\n\n protected class of Spanish heritage in Precincts 142 and 156 (Appendix 1) were disenfranchised\n\n by the confusion created by the lack of notice of the change in polling place for the December\n\n 2014 runoff election. Contestant seeks an injunction from this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.c.\n\n § 1983 vacating the runoff election and requiring a new runoff election forthwith.\n\n\n\n           IX. MOTION TO MODIFY STANDARD DISCOVERY PROCEDURES\n\n87.     Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 191.1, Contestants request that the Court sign\n\nan order shortening the time allowed for Contestee to comply with the discovery requests set forth\n\nbelow to no more than fifteen days.\n\n88.     Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 191.1, Contestants request that the Court sign\n\nan order shortening the time allowed for Contestee and third-party witnesses, voters, the City of\n\nAustin and Travis County, to comply with the discovery requests set forth below in paragraph to\n\nno more than ten days, and that the period of notice required for Deposition on Written Questions\n\nbe reduced to ten days.\n\n89.     Contestants further requests that the Court sIgn an order requmng that Contestee's\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.30\n                                                                                                         368\n\fresponse to the request for disclosure, and all other responses and answers in this case be hand-\n\ndelivered, faxed or emailed.\n\n90.      The foregoing modifications to standard discovery procedures are necessary because of\n\nthe accelerated procedures that apply to this election contest. The foregoing reasons constitute\n\ngood cause for the requested relief.\n\n                        X. RESPONSE TO SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS\n\n                                           Introduction\n\n91.    Dr. Pressley has found indisputable election irregularities and mistakes that were made in\n\nconducting the District 4 election held on December 16,2014 that show the outcome as shown by\n\nthe final canvass is not accurate and she is bringing this election contest. Because illegal votes were\n\ncounted, eligible voters were prevented from voting, legal votes were not counted, and Travis\n\nCounty election officers made errors and mistakes, Dr. Pressley is asking, pursuant to Section\n\n221.003 (a), for the \"court to ascertain whether the outcome of the District 4 Run Off election, as\n\nshown by the canvass, is not the true outcome.\"      If a contestant is prevented by the county clerk\n\nfrom proving the actual number of legal votes by the clerk's act of not preserving or requiring or\n\ncounting images of the ballots actually cast there is no way to conclude the clerk reported the true\n\noutcome . Without the images of the actual ballots there is not a true outcome and the run-off\n\nelection must be repeated preserving the images of the ballots cast as provided and required by state\n\nlaw.\n\n92.    Contestee alleges Dr. Pressley is attacking the entire state-wide electronic-voting system. In\n\nfact, the contest is limited solely to the discrete errors made by the Travis County Clerk's office in\n\nthis single election. All counties are capable of complying with the law and preserving images of\n\nthe actual ballots cast by a voter. Travis county just elected to ignore that law and the sound public\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.3l\n                                                                                                          369\n\fpolicy behind it. It cannot certify a true outcome by reason of its own misconduct in this election\n\nthat is at issue in this case.\n\n93.       Weaknesses in the Travis County Election systems are well known and have been\n\nextensively identified. Several years ago, Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir herself convened\n\na Travis County Clerk Election Study Group to evaluate Travis County's current voting system\n\nand             make             recommendations             for           future             systems.\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontentlimages/presentations_ articles/pdCtc _elections _E\n\nSG_Report_2009. pdf)        Clerk DeBeauvoir had determined that a study group was needed to\n\naddress public concerns about electronic voting and to ensure ample time to plan for an upgrade or\n\nreplacement of the existing system and \"its most significant recommendation is that Travis County\n\nmove away from an all-electronic voting system to one that offers electronically-counted paper\n\nballots.\" Clerk DeBeauvoir is on record stating the need to redesign and replace Travis County's\n\nvoting                                                                                        systems:\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontent/images/presentations articles/pdf tc elections 2\n\n013.07.26 star.pdf and https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files120 13/09/Dana-Debeauvoir-STAR-\n\nVoting-System-Diagram.pdf and \"Three years ago, DeBeauvoir decided that something had to\n\nchange. \"1 said, 'Okay, I'm fed up. I'm going to design my own system. '\" Part of her frustration\n\nstemmed from complaints lodged against the county that she felt blamed officials for things\n\nbeyond      their   control.\"(   https://www.texastribune.org12014107/09/travis-county-forges-new-\n\nterritory-voting-machines/):\n\n94.       Given the specific voting irregularities outlined herein, Dr. Laura Pressley fully supports\n\nthe Clerk's search for a more accountable and election system.      One critical component that the\n\nTravis County system is lacking is that Texas Election Code allows for a manual recount using\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.32\n                                                                                                         370\n\f\"images of ballots cast.\" When Pressley requested a manual recount using \"images of ballots cast\"\n\nfor the District 4 Run Off election, Travis County is on record stating they cannot comply.\n\nInterestingly, in January 2015, Pressley was informed both by DeBeauvoir and former Travis\n\nCounty Judge Bill Aleshire that no other candidate in Travis County's history had requested a\n\nmanual recount of \"images of ballots cast.\" A review of reported cases shows no indication that\n\nany candidate in the state has requested such a statutorily-allowed recount. This contest, therefore,\n\nto the extent it decides issues regarding this mandate and this language, is a case of first\n.       .     25\nImpressIOn.\n\n\n\n The court will, of course, be guided by the Texas Supreme Court's view of statutory language,\n25\nwhich is not as fluid as that of federal courts or other state courts.\n\n       If the statutory text is unambiguous, a court must adopt the interpretation supported\n       by the statute's plain language unless that interpretation would lead to absurd results.\n       See Tune v.

If the text is unambiguous, we must\n       take the Legislature at its word and not rummage around in legislative minutiae.\"\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.33\n                                                                                                         371\n\f95.      With regard to the fact that Travis Count's use of one version of the Hart InterCivic\n\neSlate system may violate the Texas Election Code requirements for storing, retrieving, and\n\nprinting of \"images of ballots cast,\" we respectfully assert any regulatory redefinition equating\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" with \"cast vote records\" exceeds the statutory grant of authority.26 Given\n\nthat the term \"ballot\" is defined in the Texas Election Code and \"images of ballots cast\" is\n\nreferenced with regard to recounts and \"cast vote records\" are not, the Texas Election Code trumps\n\nthe Secretary of State's administrative definitions.\n\n96.      Addressing the various pieces of evidence that became available and the irregularities that\n\noccurred during the recount is important in the analysis and evaluation of this election contest.\n\nThe recount evidence is critically material to this case and the allegations are legally relevant to\n\nthis election contest. Moreover, it is in the recount failures that Travis County's failure to use\n\nequipment up to statutory standards becomes clear.\n\n97.          The legal question raised by an election contest is whether the outcome of the\n\ncontested District 4 election is not, or cannot be conclusively determined to be, the true outcome.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Pressley has found that illegal votes were counted, Travis County Elections\n\nDivision prevented eligible voters from voting, failed to count legal votes, and engaged in other\n\nirregularities that materially affected the election results. Moreover, because of the failure of\n\nTravis County to maintain \"images of ballots cast\", the outcome cannot be determined to be the\n\n         Faced with clear statutory language, \"the judge's inquiry is at an end.\" It may be a\n         widespread practice to mine the minutiae of legislative records to discern what\n         lawmakers had in mind, but as we have held, relying on these materials is verboten\n         where the statutory text is, as here, absolutely clear.\n26 \\Ve cannot construe the rule in a manner that is inconsistent with the statute.

Contestee Casar's      ORIGINAL ANS\\VER AND                SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS             TO\n\nCONTESTANT'S ORIGINAL CONTEST OF ELECTION references the Andrade v. NAACP\n\ncase, seeks to apply it to the instant case, and states that \"the Secretary of State's certification of\n\neSlate for use by Travis County did not violate equal protection rights of voters using electronic\n\nvoting system.\"\n\n99.        Contestee Casar misinterprets Contestant Dr. Pressley's claims in this case. She does not\n\nassert a claim of violation of equal protection as it relates to electronic voting systems. Rather,\n\nContestant Dr. Pressley asserts that illegal votes were counted, election officers prevented eligible\n\nvoters from voting, election officers failed to count legal votes, and election officers made mistakes\n\nthat resulted in an election outcome which is not the true outcome and did not preserve images of\n\nballots to be used as acheck on the computer results which prevented a determination that the election\n\nand the recount was a true outcome. Thus, the Andrade case is irrelevant.\n\n100.     Contestee Dr. Pressley's election contest claims were not asserted in Andrade v. NAACP\n\nand Dr. Pressley has been directly harmed by Travis County's conduct during the District 4\n\nelection and she has been directly harmed by the County's inability to ascertain the true outcome\n\nbecause \"ballots,\" \"original ballots\" and/or \"images of ballots cast\" cannot be counted.\n\n            Tex.

In CONTESTEE'S           ORIGINAL ANSWER AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS TO\n\nCONTESTANT'S ORIGINAL CONTEST OF ELECTION he references Tex. Democratic Party\n\nv. Williams, and applies it to our case with regard to \"the eSlate did not violate voters' rights under\n\n\n\nPressley v.

Contestee Casar misinterprets Contestant Dr. Pressley's claims in this case. She does not\n\nassert claims of violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as\n\nit relates to electronic voting systems.    Rather, Contestant Dr. Pressley asserts, illegal votes were\n\ncounted, election officers prevented eligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal\n\nvotes, and election officers made mistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true\n\noutcome and they did not preserve the images of ballots which is a possible function of the eSlate\n\nprogram.\n\n103.       Additionally, as a matter of law, Dr. Pressley claims that \"cast vote records\" do not meet the\n\nstatutory requirements of \"ballots,\" \"original ballots\" and/or \"images of ballots cast.\" Therefore, if\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" were not preserved, and thus cannot be retrieved, printed and counted,\n\nthen Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\n\n\nPressley v.

Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Contestant requests the run-off election be\n\ndeclared void, a new run-off be held at which images of the ballots actually cast be preserved\n\nusing procedures compliant with the Texas Election Code for use in the event of a contest, the\n\nCourt award reimbursement for the cost of her election contest, recount fees, and that the Court\n\ngrant all other and further relief, in law and in equity, to which she may be entitled.\n\n                                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               David Rogers\n                                               LA W OFFICE OF DAVlD ROGERS\n\n\n\n                                       By:       lsi David Rogers\n                                               David A.

As I told Mr. Herring I will be contacting Sherri and him for a mutually convenient date to\ntake the depositions and then we have of course the printing of the deposition and the time for the\ndeponent(s) to read and sign and I will need time to prepare a response to the Motion. The\nphantom need asserted to move this case so fast that it prejudices my client's chance to fairly\npresent the case is strongly objected to and it just unnecessarily creates additional grounds for\nnecessitating an appeal which will delay the final decision even more, The pendency of this case is\nhaving no more of an effect on Mr. Casar that every litigant waiting for the procedures of a trial to\nwork their way and there is no evidence that the city is being adversely effected in any way. Frankly\nMr, Herring's tactical efforts to prevent Ms, Presley from having a fair opportunity to provide you\nwith all of the admissible evidence just affirms how important it is that I have the time to provide it\nto you.

DISCOVERY\n\n1.        The contestant intends that discovery be conducted under level three, a custom discovery\n\nplan for election contest devised with the approval of the court.\n\n                                                  II. SUMMARY\n\n2.        This contest is based on the facts that election irregularities, mistakes, manual, mechanical\n\nand electronic errors occurred with the election activities and tabulation of the votes that were cast\n\nusing the electronic voting machines during Early Voting and on Election Day for the December\n\n\n1\n  This 6th Amended Petition is filed in response to the Discovery production of Travis County and has more specific\nallegations pleaded. Also, this Sixth Amended Petition is filed in Response to Contestee Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar's\nAnswer and Special Exceptions to Contestant's Original Contest of Election, and the Court's order of Aprill3, 2015\nregarding those Special Exceptions, and Casar's Motion to Strike the Fifth Amended Petition.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.l\n                                                                                                                      860\n\f16, 2014 Joint Special Runoff Election for the District 4 Austin City Council City of Austin\n\nelection (referred to as the \"Runoff') and January 6, 2015 District 4 Austin City Council Recount\n\n(referred to as the \"Recount\").\n\n3.       There are numerous election irregularities in the administration and results tabulation of the\n\nRunoff election. Specifically, the most material issues are related to:\n\n            a. nine instances of corrupt Mobile Ballot Box errors during vote tabulation on election\n\n                 night at Central Counting,\n\n            b. missing data log entries in the vote tabulation systems, the Tally Audit and Ballot Now\n\n                 audit logs,\n\n            c. suspicious mathematical patterns observed in the Runoff Election results that show\n\n                 them to be erroneous and not credible,\n\n            d. Travis County election officers instructing election officers to not print and retain\n\n                 crucial, mandated election records listing specific vote results for each candidate in a\n\n                 race (Zero Tapes, Tally/Results tapes),\n\n            e. election equipment security seals that were improperly sealed, subsequently\n\n                 unsealed and replaced,\n\n            f.   not producing, counting and retaining statutorily required ballot images,\n\n            g. obstructing Contestant's official poll watchers at polling locations and Central\n\n                 Counting after the polls closed.\n\n4.      These violations materially affected the outcome of the election in that an inordinate\n\nnumber of election irregularities occurred and there was a lack of accountability of election\n\nofficers with regard to no printing of Zero Tapes, no printing of Results Tapes, denying office poll\n\nwatchers access to election activities, improperly sealed electronic devices, security breaches of\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                        p.2\n                                                                                                            861\n\fthe Tally vote tabulation system, corrupt Mobile Ballot Box entries, and Tally Audit log deletions.\n\nBecause of the erroneous reported election results, the egregious election irregularities, the missing\n\nelection records, possible criminal and fraudulent violations, the outcome of the Runoff cannot be\n\nknown.\n\n5.          Specifically, these violations caused illegal votes to be counted and election officers failed\n\nto count legal votes correctly. In addition, the pervasive and numerous election irregularities make\n\nit impossible to conclude that the reported results are the true outcome of the election. Finally,\n\nbecause no ballots, or images of ballots were preserved by the Office of the Travis County Clerk,\n\nDana DeBeauvoir, there are no ballots to count and no ballots to use to verify the electronic \"cast\n\nvote records\" in the Recount except for the paper Absentee/Mail-In ballots .\n\n6.          Section 221.0 12 of the Texas Election Code provides in pertinent part:\n\n           Sec. 221.012. TRIBUNAL'S ACTION ON CONTEST.\n           (a) If the tribunal hearing an election contest can ascertain the true outcome of\n           the election, the tribunal shall declare the outcome.\n\n            (b) The tribunal shall declare the election void if it cannot ascertain the true\n            outcome of the election.\n\n\n7.           \"A contestant seeking to have an election declared void under this provision must allege and\n\nprove that the true results of the election are impossible to ascertain.\" See City of La Grulla v.\n\nRodriguez, 415 S.

As will be presented below, many crucial election records for the 3,937 electronically cast\n\nballots in the Runoff 2 are missing or corrupted3 on the Travis County's Hart Voting System: Ballot\n\n\n2\n    Exhibit A, Runoff Recount Results showing Ballot by Mail ballots of 480, and Cast Vote Records (electronically cast\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                    p.3\n                                                                                                                          862\n\fimages, vote tabulation Tally Audit logs 4 , Zero Tapes 5 , Tally/Results tapes 6 •7 , Mobile Ballot Box\n\n       .\ncorruptwn · , 1mproper1y sea1ed secunty\n         89 .                        . sea1s 10r\n                                             C':\n                                                 votmg\n                                                    •\n                                                       eqmpment\n                                                          •     10\n                                                                   , etc.\n\n9.        The only legal ballots that have been retained, produced and recounted by Travis County,\n\nare the 480 votes cast on paper, Mail in Ballots (Exhibit 1). These ballots show an exact tie at 240\n\nballots cast as votes for Pressley and 240 ballots cast as votes for Casar (Exhibit 1).                Therefore,\n\nthe outcome of the election is a tie and neither Pressley nor Casar may be declared the victor.\n\n10.       Given the only retained ballots show an exact tie, along with the numerous mathematical\n\nanomalies observed with the Runoff election results, the statutory and mandated retention of important\n\nelection records is needed to determine the true outcome of the election. In the absence of these crucial\n\nelection records, the outcome cannot be known and this Honorable Court cannot ascertain the true\n\noutcome of the Runoff election between Pressley and Casar, and thus declare the Runoff election void\n\nand order a new election.\n\n                                                 III. PARTIES\n\n11.     Contestant Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis County,\n\nTexas. She was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Runoff Election on December\n\n16, 2014.\n\n12.

The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar\n\nwas declared the victor by 1,291 votes. 11 A \"manual recount\" of all early voting, election day,\n\nprovisional, and mailed-in ballots was attempted on January 6, 2015.\n\n13.      The mail-in ballots were exactly tied between the candidates, at 240 each, for a total of 480\n\nvotes (Exhibit A). The attempted recount was a nullity and a full recount was made impossible in\n\nthat the attempted recount violated state law and the manual recount of the 3,937 electronically\n\ncast ballots (Exhibit A) was incorrectly performed 12 using of the \"cast vote records\" in lieu of\n\n\"images of ballots cast.\"         Based on the counting of \"cast vote records\" and mail in ballots, as\n\ncould be predicted, the invalid recount did not change the reported results of the election and the\n\noriginal declaration of Mr. Casar as the victor for the runoff election did not change.\n\n14.      Casar was sworn into office on January 6, 2014. He has been notified of the filing of this\n\naction by a delivery of a copy of this Petition in accordance with TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 21.003(b).\n\n\n                                     IV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n15.      Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                                      V. FACTS\n\n                              Numerous Irregularities in Counting of Votes\n\n16.      Many election irregularities, errors, mistakes occurred with regard to the counting,\n\ntabulation, and reporting of votes for the District 4 Austin City Council Runoff Election and the\n\n\n11\n   Exhibit F, Official December 16, 2014 Runoff Cumulative Election Results.\n12\n  Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred did not satisfy\nstatutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a statutory manual recount as defined by the\nTexas Election Code 128.001(a)2, 213.016, 214.049(e), 213.016.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                    p.5\n                                                                                                                             864\n\fOfficial Recount. Many of these unexplained gaps in security and defect vote counts at a very\n\nminimum made fraud possible and make ruling out fraud an impossibility.\n\nUnnatural Mathematical Patterns Raises an Inference That the Reported Runoff Results are\n\nErroneous-November General Election and December Runoff Results Are the Same\n\n17.           The November 4, 2014 General Election for the District 4 Austin City Council City of\n\nAustin Election was comprised of 8 candidates and the December 2014 Runoff was comprised of 2\n\ncandidates (Pressley vs Casar).              A statistical analysis of the results of the election showed\n\nmathematical anomalies with the General Election and the Runoff.

Voters m the top nme (9) precincts m the City of Austin District 4 election compnse\n\nroughly 80% of the total voters in the Runoff (as documented by Exhibit G). 13 The ratio of\n\nprecinct level votes that the Contestant received compared to Contestee is the same ratio in the\n\nNovember General Election (8 candidates) as it was in the December Runoff Election (2\n\ncandidates), 35% vs 35% respectively. 14\n\n\n\n13\n     Exhibit G, Comparison Results, p. 1.\n14\n     Exhibit G, Comparison Results, p. 1.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                         p.6\n                                                                                                            865\n\f19.      In addition, the average of the percentages the Contestant received in the unweighted\n\nprecincts compared to Contestee, in the November General Election and the December Runoff, are\n\nalso equal at 35% and 35%, respectively. The fact that so many precincts showed exactly the\n\nsame and unchanged results for the General Election and the Runoff is sufficient to raise an\n\ninference that the reported results are erroneous.\n\n20.      The summary analysis (Exhibit G, p. 1) of the precinct level voting results for the General\n\nElection 15 and the precinct level results for the Runoff Election, 16 show very unusual and unique\n\nmathematical patterns and anomalies. This analysis reveals the Runoff results are erroneous and\n\nare a result of counting and tabulation errors committed by Travis County and thus the outcome of\n\nthe election cannot be determined.\n\n21.      Reviewing Travis County Voter election results for the General and Runoff Elections,\n\nthere was an overall attrition of over 4,000 voters from the General and Runoff elections. The\n\noccurrence of duplicated relative results for Pressley and Casar for the General and Runoff\n\nElection shows the results are strictly isolated to the District 4 Pressley vs Casar race, are\n\nerroneous, and are indicative of errors committed by Travis County in the vote collection and/or\n\ntabulation and clearly raises an inference that the reported results are not accurate.\n\n22.      For voters in just the top 9 precincts, there was an attrition of at least 600 voters (who\n\nvoted for either Pressley or Casar) between the General and the Runoff Elections24 · The unique\n\noccurrence that the results remain unchanged between Pressley's City Council General and Runoff\n\nis not correct.\n\n23.

Furthermore, compared to the Pressley vs Casar race, no race in 11 years shows such a\n\ntight distribution with a standard deviation of0.06%. Ten races have greater than lOx the standard\n\ndeviation (0.67% or higher) and three races show greater than 100x the standard                                                        deviation\n\n(7.05% or higher).\n\n                         Comparison of           Retums for all Austin City      Run Off Races\n                           G.eru\\'ral Eledlonvs Run Off (Rimse and Standard Oeviatkm Shown)\n\n                                      f'<t ;.., !\"\"\"\"\"''thl«il\n                            GlOI'Ie<•l <l¥uo<11\n\n                            i!lu\" OOI'c;t.v\n                            l!t.m\n\n\n                                                  c::::J\n                                              'i,i)• f',U,.   >.D • LH'l>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            Q\n                                                                        >-.!>·(Pa\"i\n\n\n\n\n                        l'r<!SM$V                                           S.oyt     Almanu   1:1'*$'11           Oilril11\n                          <t0l4      ;!01.4       ({114                     lOtJt      2014     lOlA       1:000   200$.      tOO$\n\n\n\n\nNo other Council race in the history of electronic voting in the City of Austin for Council races\n\nfrom 2003 - 2014 has shown such a tight distribution between a General and a Runoff Elections\n\nand this fact strengthens the inference that the results are erroneous.                                            These vote tabulation\n\nmistakes by Travis County are likely related to violations of, but not limited to\n\n             a. mishandling and tabulation of the electronic ballots cast on the Hart InterCivic\n\n                  hardware and software,\n17\n   Self-authenticating Travis County Website of precinct level results for Austin City Council races for the General and\nthe Runoff elections for 2003,2005,2008, and 2011 http://www.traviscountyclerk.org/eclerk/Content.do?code=E.l.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                                                p.8\n                                                                                                                                                   867\n\f             b. not adhering to the specific laws and procedures as defined by the Texas\n\n                  Constitution 18 , Texas Election Code 19 , Texas Secretary of State 20 , US Federal\n                        .\n                  El ectwns c omm1sswn\n                                 . . 2122\n                                       ' , an d\n\n25.      Hart InterCivic operation and training manuals. 23 Errors committed by Travis County\n\ncaused these 3,937 electronically cast votes 24 to be counted and tabulated incorrectly. Thus,\n\nelection officers failed to count legal votes correctly.\n\n26.      Because so many high volume District 4 precincts showed exactly the same percentage\n\nresults for Pressley and Casar, it is possible mistakes were made with the saving, loading and/or\n\ncounting the votes on the memory cards (Mobile Ballot Boxes). In addition, errors, mistakes, or\n\npossible fraudulent activity may have occurred with the hardware or software used for counting\n\nand tabulating voting results (Mobile Ballot Boxes, Tally, Rally, BOSS, JBC, eSlates, etc.) used\n\nfor the Runoff.\n\n      A.

The\n\nDecember 30, 2014 canvassed results for Early Voting were inconsistent with the December 1-10,\n\n2014 Travis County Early Voting voter reports received from Travis County.\n\n28.      During Early Voting from December 1 -December 10, Travis County published 24 hour\n\nreports that reported 2,651 total voters voted in Early Voting in District 4.

There were at least 28 duplicate entries for BBM. 25 At least 28 Ballot by Mail, mail-in\n\nballots, appear to have been counted and/or referenced twice or three times. See Exhibit N for\n\nduplicate Ballot by Mail Entries.\n\n30.      Once duplicate BBM's were removed from the voter rolls, 2,622 unique voter names\n\nremained that voted in Early Voting according to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that\n\nwere distributed prior to Election Day, December 16, 2014.\n\n31.      Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for Greg\n\nCasar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number of ballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. The unknown extra 80 ballots are distributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4\n\nRace (One precinct, with one eligible voter, showed no votes.). 26 See table below.\n\n32.      The pervasiveness of the Early Voting discrepancies in 15 precincts are evidence of\n\nsystemic errors occurring in the counting. Thus the Early Voting tabulation accuracy cannot be\n\nrelied on to determine the outcome of the election.\n\n33.      The issue of the mismatch between the number of individuals who voted and the number of\n\nballots cast, is indicative of several known and documented scenarios of errors and security\n\nbreaches that can occur with the Hart Electronic Voting Systems 27 •\n\n\n\n\n25\n   Exhibit N, Duplicate Ballot by Mail entries reported in Travis County's 24hr Early Voting Rolls\n26\n   Exhibit 0, Early Voting Discrepancies, more ballots than voters.\n27\n   Exhibit P, California Secretary of State Source Code Review of the Hart Expert and Exhibit S, affidavit declaration by\nDr. Jefferey Jacobson, Ph.D. regarding thelnterCivic Voting System:\nhttp://pubs.cs.rice.edu/sites/pubs.cs.rice.edu/files/Source%20Code%20Review%20ofl/o20the%20Hart%20InterCivic%20\nVoting%20System. pdf\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.JO\n                                                                                                                            869\n\f                                                Early Voting Dist:repandes\n\n                                          Total Ballots Cast   Voters Names per            Ballot\n                                 Pet      per Canvass and      Early Voting Roll<;      Discrepancy\n                                              Recount            from County            (Over votes}\n\n                                156              431                  42.2                   9\n                                2.22             319                  307                    12\n                                135              271                  2.64                   7\n                                139--            2.70                 265                    5\n                                140              233                  2.28                   5\n                                2.17             2.16                 2.05                   11\n                                149--            195                  191                    4\n                                133--            149                  145                    4\n                                164--            llfi                 113                    3\n                                2.60---          108                  103                    5\n                                142--            86                    83                    3\n                                2.09--           81                    77                    4\n                                2.23--           68                    66                    2.\n                                2.58--           59                    55                    4\n                                2.68--           59                    57                    2\n                                211--             24                   25                    -1\n                                2.24--            16                   16                    0\n\n\n34.        These tabulation irregularities also show the reported Runoff results for the Pressley/Casar\n\nrace are in question and are erroneous.\n                                                                               28\n35.        According to expert, Dr. Jefferey Jacobson, Ph.D.                        ,\n\n\n           The patterns Dr. Pressley found in the vote data are suspicious enough to warrant\n           further analysis and testing, especially in light of the numerous election irregularities\n           and given the security weaknesses in the Hart InterCivic voting system.\n\n36.        The previously noted, highly unlikely mathematical patterns associated with the 3,643\n\nvotes cast in the top 9 precincts, along with the Early Voting discrepancies, strongly suggests that\n\nthe electronically cast and counted votes in the Runoff cannot be relied in determining the true\n\noutcome of the election because there are no true ballot images to verify the voters' intent.\n\nContestant alleges the counting errors-in tabulating the top 9 precincts (3,643 votes) and the\n\ncounting errors in tabulating the Early Votes (2,701 votes)-committed by Travis County caused\n\n\n28\n     ExhibitS, Expert affidavit and declaration by Dr. Jeffrey Jacobson, Ph.D.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                  p.ll\n                                                                                                              870\n\fthese votes to be counted incorrectly and prevents knowing or ascertaining the true outcome of the\n\nelection.\n\n          B. Election Irregularities, Mistakes and Possibility of Fraud Makes Results Invalid\n\n37.        Travis County election officers committed numerous mistakes and election law violations\n\nrelated to all of the 3,937 electronically cast votes in the District 4 Runoff that materially affected\n\nthe outcome of the election.          For these specific electronically cast votes, Travis County failed to\n\nadhere to critical election rules, counting procedures, and security protocols as outlined in the\n\nTexas Constitution, the Texas Election Code, the Texas Secretary of States Procedure/Advisories,\n\nand the Federal Election Commission's Voting System's Standards, and the Hart Voting System\n\nrequirements.        Violations that materially affected the outcome of the election are outlined in\n\nchronological order as they occurred on Election Day and during the Recount in the following\n\nrespects:\n\n         1.   Not printing Zero Tape Reports\n\n38.        The Texas Secretary of State29 and Hart InterCivic Manuals 30 require the printing of Zero\n\nTape Reports during Early Voting and on Election Day at each precinct/polling location. Zero\n\nTape Reports are defined by the Texas Secretary of State as \"A Zero Tape is the tape that is\n\nprinted when the voting machine is first set up at the polls. It is called a Zero Tape since all\n\ncontests or propositions should have zero votes next to each name or question.\" Exhibit J, p. 13\n\nand 35.\n\n39.        According to the Texas Secretary of State's Election Advisory No. 2012-03(6)(g)(vi), for\n\n \"Opening the Polls:\n      vi. 1. At a minimum print one zero tape from each applicable device, as follows: The\n\n29\n     Exhibit J, Texas Secretary of State 2012-03 and June 2014 Electronic Voting Procedures Advisories.\n30\n     Exhibit M, Hart Training Manual\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.l2\n                                                                                                              871\n\f        presiding judge, an election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or more watchers\n        are present, shall sign the zero tape. 2. Maintain zero tapes in a secure location to be\n        returned with election materials (i.e. Ballot Box #4 or other secure means designated by the\n        general custodian of election records).\" (emphasis added)\n\n40.     According to Hart's Voting System Support Procedures Training Manual Exhibit J, p. 108,\n\n\"The \"Zero Tape\" report displays the contests and options [candidates] available on the ballot( s)\n\nfor this polling place. It is proof that the JBC has no votes cast on it the first day of Early Voting\n\nand/or the start of Election Day.\" emphasis added.\n\n41.     Travis County received a waiver from the Secretary of State granting permission to not\n\nprint Zero Tapes for the November 41h General Election because of the extensive number of races\n\nand candidates for the General Election. The Secretary of State did not provide a waiver granting\n\npermission to not print Zero Tapes for the December 16, 2014 Runoff and Special Election which\n\nhad a very small number of races and candidates (Austin Mayor, Council Members, AISD and\n\nACC Trustees).\n\n42.     Michael Winn, Travis County Elections Division Director, in a phone call, relayed to\n\nContestant on December 15, 2014, they were instructing election judges to not print Zero Tapes at\n\nthe beginning of Early Voting and to not print Zero Tapes on Election Day for the Runoff.\n\nReview of Discovery documents provided by Travis County, no Zero Tapes (showing the number\n\nof votes present on the Hart Voting equipment for each candidate when the polls open) were\n\nprinted during Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election Day of the Runoff. This\n                                                                                              31\nis evidenced by the JBC Report Envelope produced by Travis County, Exhibit C.\n\n43.     Travis County disregarded the printing Zero Tape Reports and the Hart InterCivic\n\noperational procedures and the retention of crucial election records mandated by the Texas\n\n31\n Exhibit C, JBC Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Zero Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                              p.l3\n                                                                                                                872\n\fSecretary of State. As a result, as the Hart Training Manual (Exhibit M) states, there is no ''proof\n\nthat the JBC has no votes cast on it the first day of Early Voting and/or the start of Election Day\"\n\n(emphasis added) at the Countywide Polling locations the Runoff.\n\n44.         A critical election security protocol for retaining key election records was ignored.                This\n\nundermines the claimed DRE results, (3,937) electronically cast ballots, for the District 4 race\n\nbecause there is no \"proofthat the JBC has no votes cast on it the first day of Early Voting and/or\n\nthe start of Election Day.\" The Travis County officers violations affected the outcome of the\n\nelection because votes may have remained on the voting equipment (Mobile Ballot Boxes\n\n(MBB's), eSlates and JBC) and as a result the court cannot ascertain the true outcome of the\n\nelection.\n\n          2. Not printing Results/Tally Tape Reports\n\n45.         The Texas Secretary of State also mandates the printing of Results/Tally Tape Reports on\n\nElection Day at each precinct/polling location. 32 Tally/Results Tape Reports are defined by the\n\nTexas Secretary of State as \"A Results Tape is the tape that is printed when the polls close. It is\n\ncalled a Results tape since all contests and propositions are listed and have the resulting votes next\n\nto each name or question.\" Exhibit J, p. 12 and 35.\n\n46.    According to the Texas Secretary of State's Election Advisory No. 2012-03(6)(k)(iii)\nExhibit J, for\n\n \"Closing the Polls:\"\n       iii. After the polls have been closed on Election Day, the precinct election officials shall\n       print out, at a minimum, two copies of the results tape from each applicable device and\n       secure the voting device against further use. (Warning do not print the results tape during\n       Early Voting; this includes the last day of Early Voting). 1. The presiding election judge,\n       an election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or more watchers are present,\n       shall sign the results tape(s). 2. The copies of the results tape(s) shall be distributed as\n\n32\n     Exhibit J, Texas Secretary of State 2012-03 and June 2014 Electronic Voting Procedures Advisories.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                     p.l4\n                                                                                                                        873\n\f        follows: a. Envelope #3 this is delivered to the presiding election judge; and b. Ballot Box\n        #4 (or other secure means designated) that is delivered to the general custodian of election\n        records, along with other election media and materials.\" Emphasis added.\n\n47.     Similarly as noted above, Travis County received a waiver from the Secretary of State\n\ngranting permission to not print Results/Tally Tape Reports for the November 41h General Election\n\nbecause of the extensive number of races and candidates for the General Election. 33 The Secretary\n\nof State did not provide a waiver granting permission to not print Results Tapes for the December\n\n16, 2014 Runoff and Special Election which had a very small number of races and candidates\n\n(Austin Mayor, Council Members, AISD and ACC Trustees).\n\n48.     Michael Winn, Travis County Director of Elections also relayed to Contestant on\n\nDecember 15, 2014, that election officers were instructed to not print Tally/Results Tapes at the\n\nclose of the polls on Election Day. A review of Discovery documents provided by Travis County,\n\nshows no Results Tapes were printed or signed by election officers on Election Day of the Runoff.\n34\n\n\n\n49.     Travis County produced actual envelopes the election officers used to store official election\n\nrecords. 35 On the front of each of the election judges' JBC Report Envelopes (where polling\n\nlocation election records are stored and returned), were the instructions, \"DO NOT PRINT THE\n\nTALLY.\" 36\n\n50.     In addition, in Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir's deposition (Exhibit D, p. 128, 13-\n\n15), she confirms election judges were instructed to not print the Tally/Results tapes that the Texas\n\n33\n   Exhibit T, Texas Secretary of State Waiver for General Election, Nov. 4th 2015.\n34\n   Exhibit C, JBC Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.\n35\n   Exhibit C, JBC Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.\n36\n   Exhibit C, JBC Report Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations. On the cover of the\nJBC Report Envelope, instructions to election officers clearly state, \"DO NOT PRINT THE TALLY.\"\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.l5\n                                                                                                                         874\n\fSecretary of State requires.\n\n51.    Without Results/Tally Tape Reports, there is no proof of the vote totals each candidate\n\nreceived during the election, prior to the election materials (eSlates, JBC' s and MBB' s) being\n\ntransferred to Central Counting for electronic tabulation.\n\n52.    The Results/Tally Tapes are an essential backup election record of the vote and they help\n\nensure the electronically cast 3,937 votes results are consistent with subsequent Central Counting\n\ncomputer tabulation results. A critical election security protocol for retaining key election records\n\nwas ignored by Travis County and thus invalidates the results for the (3,937) electronically cast\n\nballots for the District 4 race because there is no proof that the JBC had no votes cast on it\n\nerroneously for the Runoff or that there were computer corruption issues at Central Counting that\n\nskewed the true will of the voters in the Runoff.\n\n53.    The lack of retention of the Results/Tally tape further highlight the fact the Runoff results\n\nare erroneous, cannot be trusted due to corruption errors, and cannot be validated with retained\n\nelection records, and so many security protocols were violated. These irregularities have caused\n\nthe true outcome, of the 3,937 electronically cast votes in the Runoff, to not be known.\n\n\n\n      4.Contestant's Official Poll Watchers Were Denied Access on Election Night- Four Counts\n\n      of Criminal Violations Committed by Travis County Election Officer\n\n54.    Two of Contestant's Official Poll Watchers were denied access to and were prevented from\n\nsigning Results/Tally Tapes. Rae Nadler-Olenick and Paul Williams were official poll watchers\n\nfor the Pressley Campaign and they were enied access to Results/Tally Tapes on December 16,\n\n2014 at polling location Randalls at Braker/Research Hwy 183 and Gus Garcia Recreation Center,\n\nrespectively.\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.l6\n                                                                                                        875\n\f55.     Both Mrs. Nadler-Olenick and Mr. Williams were present and observed that official\n\nPoll/Tally tapes were not printed when the polls were closed at their respective polling locations.\n\nThey were both present and observed that Results/Tally tapes were not printed before the election\n\nmaterials     and     equipment      was     removed       from     their    respective     polling     locations.\n\nThey were both prevented from signing the official Results/Tally tapes because the election\n\nofficials at Randalls were instructed to not print the Results/Tally tapes 37 and they, intum, did not\n\nprint them. 38 See affidavit of official poll watcher, Paul Williams, Exhibit U. 39\n\n56.     The Travis County officers violations materially affected the outcome of the election\n\nbecause there is no way to verify the voting equipment and vote results (MBB, eSlate, and JBC)\n\nwere s not corrupted or modified after leaving the polling location. We know for a fact from\n\nmultiple Travis County election officer affidavits that many security seals on the election\n\nequipment were improperly sealed, seals were removed, and resealed because of security issues. 40\n\nTwo additional Pressley Official Poll Watchers were denied access to view election activities at\n\nthe Dobie Middle School election substation and the Travis County Central Counting facility on\n\nElection Day after the polls closed.\n\n57.     Sergio Martinez and Claire Martinez were also Official Campaign Poll Watchers for\n\nContestant. Sergio and Claire Martinez were initially denied access to Dobie Middle School,\n\nSubstation on December 16, 2014 and were not able to monitor and track the first set of election\n\nmaterials being transferred from the countywide polling location at Gus Garcia Recreation Center\n\n\n37\n   Exhibit C, JBC Report Envelope contents produced by Travis County showing the District 4 polling locations election\nmaterials- no Results/Tally Tapes were printed or signed by election judges at those locations.

This was one of the strongest Pressley precincts and voting locations in\n\nDistrict 4 and they intended to track the MBB chain of custody and transfer procedures.\n\n58.       Election materials entered and left the Dobie Substation and Mr. and Mrs. Martinez were\n\nnot able to monitor the chain of custody and transfer status of election materials (MBB's, etc.)\n\nfrom the various polling locations. This affected the outcome of the Runoff election in that errors\n\nin tabulating votes and maintaining security protocols occurred at Central Counting.\n\n59.       Also, Sergio and Claire Martinez were subsequently denied access in monitoring the\n\ntransfer of election materials (including but not limited to Mobile Ballot Boxes, sealed JBC and\n\neSlate computers, official envelopes with materials, and the like) and were prevented from\n\nmonitoring the tabulation activities occurring at Central Counting on Election night on December\n\n16, 2014.\n\n60.       On Election night, Contestant made numerous personal phone calls to the Travis County\n\nDirector of Elections, Michael Winn, informing him of that Mr. and Mrs. Martinez were\n\nrepeatedly being denied direct access to election and tabulation activities at Central Counting and\n\nMr. Winn did not correct the situation after multiple conversations.\n\n61.       Obstructing an official poll watcher is a Class A misdemeanor in the Texas Election Code\n\n33.061:\n\n          Sec. 33.061. UNLAWFULLY OBSTRUCTING WATCHER. (a) A person commits an\n          offense if the person serves in an official capacity at a location at which the presence of\n          watchers is authorized and knowingly prevents a watcher from observing an activity the\n          watcher is entitled to observe. (b) An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor.\n          Acts 1985, 69th Leg., ch. 211, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1986.\n\n62.       Multiple \"activities the watcher is entitled to observe\" were violate by Travis County\n\nelection officers as it relates to Pressley's official watchers:\n\n             a. Pressley poll watchers Paul Williams and Rae Nadler-Olenick were prevented from\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.l8\n                                                                                                        877\n\f               observing the printing and signing of Result tapes at the respective polling locations\n\n               they were serving on Election Day, and\n\n           b. Pressley poll watchers Sergio and Claire Martinez were prevented from accessing\n\n               and observing election materials transfer at Dobie Middle School and election\n\n               material transfer/election tabulation activities at Central Counting, respectively, on\n\n               Election Day.\n\n\n63.    Multiple election irregularities occurred at Central Counting on Election Day and\n\nPressley's poll watchers were denied access to monitor and report the issues. These election\n\nirregularities are the most concerning and egregious out of all the irregularities which occurred\n\nduring the Runoff election. These are very serious Class A misdemeanors, criminal violations, of\n\nthe Texas Election Code 33.061 and Contestant has documented violations of four separate counts.\n\n64.    These violations materially affected the outcome of the election in that an inordinate\n\nnumber of election irregularities occurred and there was a lack of accountability of election\n\nofficers with regard to no printing of Zero Tapes, no printing of Results Tapes, denying office poll\n\nwatchers access to election activities, improperly sealed electronic devices, security breaches of\n\nthe Tally vote tabulation system, corrupt Mobile Ballot Box entries, and Tally Audit log deletions.\n\nThe intent of the poll watchers is to ensure accountability, transparency, and secure practices are\n\nadhered to.      Because of the erroneous reported election results, the egregious election\n\nirregularities, and the missing election records, the outcome of the Runoff cannot be known.\n\n5.Audit Logs at Central Counting Show Missing Logs, Security Issues and Corrupt Files Loaded\n\n65.    Hart Voting System Audit Logs show multiple problems\n\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.l9\n                                                                                                        878\n\f               a. Tally Audit log and Ballot Now entries missing (Exhibit B, V, 41 W42 )\n\n               b. Security issues (Exhibit B, E)\n\n               c. MBB processing errors during vote tabulations at Central Counting on Election\n\n                   Day, December 16,2014, and (Exhibit B)\n\n               d. questionable entries into the Tally and security systems after Contestant filed her\n\n                   Election Contest, etc. (Exhibit B).\n\n66.        Numerous software/hardware errors occurred when Travis County electronically\n\ntransferred and tabulated the electronic Cast Vote Records.          There are nine \"Invalid/Corrupt\n\nMBB\" errors recorded in the Tally Audit logs during Election Day tabulations of votes. These are\n\nerrors associated with tabulating the electronic votes from the Mobile Ballot Boxes (Exhibit B\n\npages 5, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29 and 42). According to the Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir, the\n\nTally Audit logs are legally required and she describes the information the logs contain:\n\n           \"In general, they're going to track every single step, everything that's happening at the\n\n           counting station on election night.·· So every time something's turned on, every time\n\n           something's turned off, every time an entry happens.\" (Exhibit D, DeBeauvoir's Deposition,\n\n           p. 72 ,19-23)\n\n67.         The audit logs in the Tally (Exhibit B) and Ballot Now subsystems (Exhibit V and W)\n\nshow long periods of apparent inactivity between an administrator's last recorded action and a\n\nsession logout. They range from two hours to days long (see summary table, below).\n\n\n\n\n41\n     Exhibit V, Security audit logs for BN PC5system\n42\n     Exhibit V, Security audit logs for BN PC3 system\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.20\n                                                                                                        879\n\f                                                  Time System     Time Frame System Was Open and\n      Date of logOut   Travis County audit logs\n                                                   Was Open                 Vulnerable\n        12/1/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)         10 days                 Early Voting\n        12/2/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC5)          7 days                 Early Voting\n       12/10/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          9 days                 Early Voting\n       12/11/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          1 day                  Early Voting\n       12/12/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)           1day                  Early Voting\n       12/15/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          3 days                 Early Voting\n       12/16/2014               Tally             2 hrs, 44 min       Election Day Tabulations\n       12/16/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC3)          1 day            Election Day Tabulations\n       12/18/2014        Ballot Now (BNPC5)          8 days           Election Day Tabulations\n        1/6/2015                Tally               4 hours                   Recount\n\n\n\n68.         During these extended logon times, anyone with physical access to the computer could\n\nuse the administrator account to arbitrarily change vote information in the database then directly\n\nedit the log files to hide the fact (ExhibitS, Dr. Jacobson's affidavit). This would require no more\n\nskill than reading the Tally manual and using legal administrator commands. There are unusually\n\nlong periods of apparent inactivity during a crucially important logged-in Tally administration\n\nsession during Election Day when vote tabulations were underway from !2:30pm thru 3:24pm\n\n(Exhibit B).\n\n69.         When not in use, the Tally system should be logged off to protect the security of the vote\n\ntabulation database. Having the system open is a critical security breach. The Tally system vote\n\ntabulation database was left open and security was compromised or there are activity files missing.\n\nEither way, the integrity of the electronic vote tabulation cannot be trusted.                   Thus, the outcome\n\ncannot be known to be true. Every vote counted electronically cast and counted (3,937) cannot be\n\nknown and exceed the margin of victory. The Court cannot determine the will of the votes and a\n\nnew election is required.\n\n70.         When asked about other extended time periods where the Tally administrator was logged\n\non and no activity was documented for roughly 7 days (Exhibit B) DeBeauvoir (Exhibit D,\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                 p.21\n                                                                                                                     880\n\fdeposition) stated, \"I don't know what this means .. .I don't believe that's true .. .I doubt it's true .. .I\n\ndoubt it's true ... [the log is wrong?] yeah .. .I don't think that's true ... I don't know ... \" (Exhibit M,\n\nDana's Deposition p. 114, line 16 thru p. 117, p. 3).\n\n71.     In effect, the Travis County Clerk under oath when asked about the Tally Audit logs and\n\nthe issues, she stated, \"I don't think that's [Audit logs] true.\" Because the voting tabulation\n\nsystem was left open and security was compromised or there are log files missing, the integrity of\n\nthe vote tabulation cannot be trusted.          Thus, the outcome of the electronically tabulated votes\n\ncannot be known to be true.\n\n72.     Tally Audit Logs show multiple error codes being registered during the loading ofMBB's\n\nduring vote tabulations at Central Counting 43 .           With no Results/Tally Tape Reports from the\n\npolling locations (Exhibit C), there is no data to validate the results of the tabulation of the\n\nelectronically cast ballots and, thus, the results for the (3,937) electronically cast ballots for the\n\nDistrict 4 race and the outcome cannot be known.\n\n73.     In this election, the Tally Audit log produced by Travis County shows no less than nine (9)\n\ninstances of a corrupted Mobile Ballot Box being introduced into the Travis County election Tally\n\nsystem (Exhibit B). These documented, admitted nine (9) separate instances of corrupted data being\n\nintroduced into the election count system make it impossible to determine the true outcome of the\n\nelection. 44\n\n74.     This is an extraordinary level of corrupt mobile ballot boxes (MBBs), showing something\n\nwas wrong with the system that tallied the votes, according to the Travis County Clerk. From her\n\ndeposition (Exhibit D, page 98, lines 18-20; page 99 lines 4 -9):\n\n43\n  Exhibit B, Tally Audit Logs\n44\n  See ExhibitS, Declaration of expert witness Jeffrey Jacobson, Ph.D; See also Attachment B thereto, Audit Log\nproduced by Travis County; See also Exhibit D, Deposition of Dana DeBeauvoir, p. 87, 94, 96, 97, and 98, and Tally\nAudit Log, Exhibit 12 to Exhibit M (authenticated at page 55-56.)\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.22\n                                                                                                                     881\n\f       Q. [I]t's a little unusual to have so many\n       invalid MBBs in an election tally, isn't it?\n       A.· ·I've never heard of so many -\n\n       A. I suspect there's something wrong with the\n       reader, not the MBBs.\n       Q. (BY MR. COHEN) Okay. So you think-- your\n       suspicion is that there was something wrong with the\n       reader that night?\n       A. Correct.\n\n75.    There were more invalid/corrupt ballot boxes in a single election than Dana DeBeauvoir had\n\never heard of. DeBeauvoir is a person of extraordinary experience and knowledge in elections. She\n\nhas been Travis County Clerk for 28 years, overseeing elections in all that time, including every\n\nelection since 2002 using the Hart eSlate system. And she has NEVER HEARD OF as many invalid\n\nMBBs in an election tally as there were in this election. The Travis County Clerk herself conceded\n\nthat something was very wrong with the system tallying the votes -- that there was a degree of error\n\nin that election beyond anything she had ever heard of happening before.\n\n76.     And, according to her deposition testimony (Exhibit D), she has no idea why. From her\n\ndeposition, page 95, lines 6-10:\n\n       Q. · ·I haven't seen anywhere in this audit log what-- where it tells you what it did when it\n       found a corrupt MBB. .. Do you -- is that ...\n       A.· ·Yeah.· ·There would be other documentation that will tell you what happened.·· I can't\n       tell you.\n\n77.    From her deposition, page 96, lines 22-25:\n\n       ·Q.· ·(BY MR. COHEN)· ·Again, on page 23, if you go down by 8:42, there's another\n       \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB,\" and we still don't know what happened to that MBB.\n        A.· ·Same thing.\n\n78.    From her deposition, page 97, lines 1-8:\n\n       Q. · ·Okay.· ·And then there's another one a little further down, again.· ·And then there-- it\n       says \"MBB already read by Tally.\"· ·Do you see that?· ·There's three of those in a row.\n       A.· ·Uh-huh. · ·Uh-huh.\n       Q. · ·Do you have any idea what that-- what happened as a result of that?\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                    p.23\n                                                                                                        882\n\f           A.· ·I'm sorry.· ·I don't.\n\n According to expert, Dr. Jefferey Jacobson, Ph.D.(Exhibit S p. 1-2), \"Properly created MBB(s)\n\nmay have contained legitimate votes, but some event made it/them unreadable or corrupted ...\n\nAlternatively, a third party may 'Introduce corrupt MBBs into the legitimate flow ofMBBs from the\n\nprecincts back to Election Central' (California report, page 48, paragraph 1). 45 This could damage\n\nthe credibility of the vote counting process.\"\n\n79.        Corrupt MBBs, whether deliberately tampered with or accidentally introduced into the\n\nsystem, will either result in a failure to count actual votes, or in the counting of invalid votes, or in\n\nother corruption of the system.\n\n80.        In any event, nine (9) separate introductions of corrupted mobile ballot boxes into a system\n\ndesigned to tally votes is sufficient to undermine the reliability of the purported outcome.\n\n81.        The numerous irregularities (mathematical anomalies, failure to keep ballot images, failure to\n\nprint and keep Tally/Results tapes, numerous Invalid/Corrupt Mobile Ballot Box errors, Mobile\n\nBallot Box reader malfunction, deleted Tally Audit log data, and security breaches of the Tally\n\nsystem, shutting down polling locations) all render impossible a determination of the true outcome\n\nof the 3,93 7 electronically cast votes in the Runoff election.\n\n\n\n     6.Travis County Conducted Critical Recount Activities from January 4, 2015 through January 6,\n\n     2015 at 10:59am, before the Official Recount on January 6, 2015 at 11 :OOam.\n\n82.        The discussion of the problems and illegalities arising in the \"recount\" are relevant to the\n\n\n45\n  Exhibit A, Attachment 5, California Report: Inguva, S., Rescorla, E., Shacham, H., & Wallach, D.

This report is an official California government record, obtained through an\nofficial California government website, and is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under Texas Rule of\nEvidence 803(8) (c) (new number 803 (8)(A)(iii), effective Aprill, 2015.), and TRE 902 (5).\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                              p.24\n                                                                                                                        883\n\felection contest because the issues that appeared for the first time in the recount pointed to errors in\n\nthe conduct of the election. Specifically, the inability of Travis County to produce \"images of\n\nballots cast\" at the recount, in violation Texas Election Code§ 213.016led to the discovery that the\n\nmachines, as configured by Travis County for the December run-off election, violated Texas\n\nElection Code§ 128.001(a)(2). The discovery that Travis County, in operating the December run-\n\noff election, did not \"provide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main\n\ncomputer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection, ballot image storage, and result\n\ntabulation\" is conclusive evidence of illegality in the election.\n\n83.     One of the items the tribunal in an election contest is charges with determining is if \"the\n\noutcome of the contested election, as shown by the final canvass, is not the true outcome because: ...\n\nan election officer or other person officially involved in the administration of the election: ...\n\nengaged in other fraud or illegal conduct or made a mistake.\" TEX. ELEC. CODE§ 221.003.\n\n84.     Failing to print the legally required \"images of ballots cast\" for the election recount is a\n\nviolation of Texas Election Code§ 213.016 by itself. But it also led proximately to the discovery of\n\nadditional illegality.\n\n85.     Moreover, the discovery of those two illegalities undermine both the possibility of an\n\naccurate count or an accurate recount, as \"images of ballots cast\" are a prerequisite to a recount, and\n\nthe counting of actual ballots is the nature of a count.\n\n86.     The errors and illegalities at the \"recount\" also led to the discovery in the audit logs of\n\nmultiple corrupt mobile ballot boxes and other errors in the conduct of the election, some of which\n\nwere testified to by the County Clerk.\n\n87.     Unofficial recount activities were completed on January 4 - 6.           This was prior to the\n\nofficial Recount Start Notice (January 6, 2015 at 11:Oam) and as a result, Pressley and her official\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.25\n                                                                                                           884\n\fwatchers were not aware of and not allowed to monitor the unofficial recount activities that\n\noccurred prior.\n\n88.        On January 4 - January 5, 2015, prior to the start of the Official Recount on January 6,\n\n2015, Travis County Clerk and the Election Division officers conducted unofficial recount\n\nactivities in which they:\n\n               a.   gained access to the sealed and archived voting records for the District 4 Austin\n\n                    City Council Runoff Election on December 16, 2014, (Exhibit B)\n\n               b. Electronically extracted the District 4 voting records in the form of Cast Vote\n\n                    Records, (Exhibit B),\n\n               c. copied and compiled the official District 4, Cast Vote Records into a single pdf\n\n                    report, (Exhibit X) 46\n\n               d. printed roughly 4,000 Cast Vote Records for the District 4 race,\n\n               e. convened members of the Recount Committee whose roles were to recount votes\n\n                    (Exhibit Y) 47\n\n               f.   conducted unofficial Recount activities that lasted 4-6 hours 48 .\n\n89.        A Travis County employee, a member of the recount committee, who was present at the\n\nOfficial Recount on January 6th, relayed to one Pressley's recount watchers, on January 6, 2015,\n\n\"They started all this on Sunday [January 4, 2015].\"\n\n90.        Direct evidence of unofficial recount activities are shown in the Audit logs of Travis\n\nCounty's Hart Tally and SERVO systems (Exhibit B). These various audit logs document access,\n\nextraction, compilation, and printing of reports of the official District 4 Cast Vote Records and\n\n\n46\n     Exhibit X, Early Vote CVR in one file, used to print CVR, produced by Travis County\n47\n     Exhibit Y, Recount Invoice from Travis County\n48\n     Exhibit Y, Recount Invoice from Travis County\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.26\n                                                                                                        885\n\fdata on January 4th (2:18pm), January 5th (2:18pm), and January 6th (8:24am)-all prior to the start\n\ntime of the Official Recount on January 6, 2015 at 11 :OOam.\n\n91.    Contestant and her Official Vvatchers attended the Official Recount which started at 11:00\n\nam and individuals tasked with counting votes were dismissed around 4:30pm (roughly after 5.5\n\nhours). Additional evidence for unofficial recount activities are shown in the invoice (Exhibit Y)\n\nof the Recount charges which was provided to Contestant by Travis County after the Official\n\nRecount. The invoice documents Recount Committee members such as individuals who were\n\ntemporary employees and who counted votes. In many cases, individuals counting votes were\n\ndocumented as working over 9 hours performing vote recounting activities.\n\n92.    This Travis County Recount invoice documents Recount Committee members counting\n\nvotes, spent roughly twice the hours (Exhibit Y) required to complete the Official Recount and\n\nContestant's Official Watchers were not allowed to monitor those prior recount activities.\n\n93.    In addition, at the Official Recount, Contestant requested to view the source and properties\n\nof the CVR files, such as dates of the CVR files and origination, and was denied by the Recount\n\nCommittee Member, the Travis County Director of Elections, Michael Winn.\n\n94.    Obstructing an Official Watcher is a criminal offense and materially affected the outcome\n\nof the Recount.    Contestant and her Official Poll Watchers were denied access and were not\n\nallowed to monitor the critical recount activities such as vote retrieval and counting (Exhibit Y).\n\n95.    Most importantly, Contestant and her official Recount Watchers were not allowed to\n\nmonitor the integrity of where the Cast Vote Records were retrieved (Exhibit B), the source where\n\nthe retrieval occurred, or the copying of the Cast Vote Record files to an aggregated pdf file. The\n\nRecount pdf file obtained from Travis County during Production, is an electronic file and was\n\ncreated on January 6 approximately at 10:00 am was used to print, and was used to count votes in\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                   p.27\n                                                                                                      886\n\fthe Recount.\n\n96.       Denying Contestant her rightful access to monitor Recount activities and determine that\n\nillegal votes (in the form of duplicate copies of CVR's) were printed and counted, materially\n\naffected the outcome of the Recount. Counting copies of 3,937 CVR's do not meet the statutory\n\nrequirements for counting legal votes. The only legal votes produced at the Recount were the Mail\n\nin Ballots which were counted and tabulated to result in an exact tie of 240 votes for Pressley and\n\n240 votes for Casar (Exhibit A).\n\n7. Illegal Votes Counted-Statutory Ballots, Ballot Images and Images of Ballots Cast Were not\n\nRetained, Produced or Counted at Official Recount\n\n97.       On Tuesday, January 6, 2015, at 11:00 a.m. when the recount was to begin, the Travis\n\nCounty Clerk and the Recount Committee relayed to Contestant and her official recount watcher,\n\nKaren Renick that images of ballots cast on the Hart Electronic Voting System (eSlate) were not\n\navailable, would not be printed, and would not be recounted. 49\n\n98.       At that meeting, Dr. Pressley expressly stated, in her \"Petition Requesting a Recount,\" and\n\n\"Amended Petition Requesting a Recount\" that \"[w ]e are requesting a manual recount of the\n\nresults using the actual, stored, ballot images.\"     (See Appendix 11.) Pressley also expressly\n\nrequested \"a manual (by-hand) count.\" \"[T]he election code expressly provides for the 'printing\n\nof images of ballots cast using direct recording electronic voting machines for the purpose of a\n\nmanual recount.'

Printing the CVR data files was in essence reprinting the previous electronically counted\n\nresults obtained on Election night. A CVR is a printing of a data file to a template. A template\n\nthat does not meet the statutory requirements for a \"ballot\" or an image of a \"ballot\" and as such it\n\nis not a meaningful check on the original count. 50\n\n101.   The recount failed to only count legal votes because \"images of ballots cast\" were not\n\n\n50\n   Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. Travis County's production of a \"cast vote\nrecord\" is a subset of the information on an Official Ballot. Therefore, an \"image of ballots cast,\" if\na true image, is an exact replica of a ballot cast. The 2014 Electronic Voting System Procedures\nbulletin, posted online at http://wVvw.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/clectronic-voting-system-\nprocedures.shtml, the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot images.\nSee, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8- Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEC § 214.071):\n1. The candidate requesting a recount may request that the recount be done electronically or\n        manually.\n2. For an electronic recount, the persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n        also authorized to be present as the election media are reloaded into the central accumulator\n        system.\n3. For a manual recount of a DRE election, the Recount Coordinator shall organize the printing of\n        cast vote records (ballot images) for the affected race or issue.\na.         The Recount Coordinator shall notify the parties in the recount of the date, place, and time\n                 the printing of cast vote records (ballot images) will take place.\nb.         The full recount committee is not required to be present at the printing of cast vote records\n                 (ballot images) and the Recount Chair shall determine how many members should be\n                 present. The persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n                 entitled to be present as the cast vote records (ballot images) are printed and to have\n                 the same number of representatives as allowed for the recount.\nc.         If the manual recount does not take place immediately after the printing of the cast vote\n                 records (ballot images), the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be locked\n                 and secured until the recount takes place.\nd.         A manual count of the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be conducted in the\n                 same manner as a recount of hand-counted paper ballots.\nAfter the recount is complete, the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be secured and\npreserved for the appropriate preservation period for maintaining election records.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                   p.29\n                                                                                                           888\n\fprovided and counted. Using the 3,937 CVR's instead of ballot image violates Texas Election\n\nCode 214.049 (e): \"If electronic voting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original\n\nballot, rather than the duplicate of the original ballot, shall be counted.\" Ballots are defined in\n\nTexas Election Code Chapter 52, Subchapter C. 5 1\n\nCast Vote Records are not legal Ballots, Ballot Images or Images of Ballots Cast\n\n102.   The most material fact in this lawsuit and is at a minimum hotly contested. Contestee relies\n\non post-hoc letters and instructions from agencies with a bureaucratic bias to argue that a cast vote\n\nrecord satisfies the statutory and constitutional requirements that an image of a ballot cast be kept to\n\nverify the computers tabulation of what the actual ballot the voter sees when the selecting a\n\ncandidate. Contestant relies on the factual difference between the ballot used and the cast vote\n\nrecord, expert testimony relying on reports and government statements and the statutes and laws of\n\nthe State of Texas to contend that a cast vote record does not comply with the law's requirement to\n\nmaintain images of the ballots cast. The resolution of this issue is very material to the decision in\n\nthis case because if a cast vote record is not a ballot or an image of a ballot there were no votes in\n\nthe election that can be counted other than the Absentee/Mail in Ballots.\n\n1. Definitions of \"Ballot Image\"\n\n51\n  For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that subchapter are Sec. 52.003 and Sec.\n52.070.\nSec. 52.003. PLACING CANDIDATE'S NAME ON BALLOT. (a) Except as otherwise provided\nby law, the authority responsible for having the official ballot prepared shall have placed on the\nballot the name of each candidate: ...\nSec. 52.070. VOTING SQUARE AND INSTRUCTION FOR CANDIDATES. (a) A square for\nvoting shall be printed to the left of each candidate's name on a ballot.\n(b) Immediately below \"OFFICIAL BALLOT,\" the following instruction shall be printed: \"Vote\nfor the candidate of your choice in each race by placing an 'X' in the square beside the candidate's\nname.\"\n\n(e) A square shall be printed to the left of each line provided for write-in voting under Section\n52.066(c), but failure to place a mark in the square does not affect the counting of a write-in vote.\n(emphasis added.)\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                    p.30\n                                                                                                           889\n\f103.    The Texas Secretary of State defines \"Ballot image\" without reference to a notion of \"Cast\n\nVote Records.\" 52 Per the Secretary of State's Glossary of Election Terminonolgy (Exhibit AA, p.\n\n2): \"Ballot Image: The ballot as it appears on a direct recording electronic (DRE) voting system. A\n\nballot image is self-evidently therefore not a Cast Vote Record.\n\n104.    The phrase \"Cast Vote Record\" does not appear in the Exhibit 0, Texas Secretary of State's\n\nGlossary of Election Terminology. !d.\n\n105.      The Federal government also defines \"Ballot image\" without reference to the notion of\n\n\"Cast Vote Record.\" In 1990, the Federal Election Commission's Performance and Testing Standard\n\nfor Punchcard, Marksense, and Direct Recording Electronic Voting Systems (DRE) 53 (Exhibit K, p.\n\n48, paragraph 1) reported:\n\n        To attain a measure of integrity over the process, DRE systems must also maintain\n        images of each ballot that is cast, such that records of individual ballots are\n        maintained by a subsystem independent and distinct from the main vote detection,\n        diagnostic, processing and reporting path.\n\n106.    Therefore, a Cast Vote Record (CVR) is not an image of\"each ballot that is cast.\"\n\n107.    To the extent the 1990 FEC report discusses what would later be known by others as \"Cast\n\nVote Records,\" the FEC distinguishes these data files from ballot images, saying there should be two\n\npathways for vote records in DRE's: a) images of ballots cast capability, and b) vote detection,\n\nprocessing and reporting path for vote data. The CVR is a reporting path/subsystem for reporting\n\nvoete results to the Tally system and a ballot image is an image file that is independent from a data\n\nreporting path (See Exhibit K). Therefore a Cast Vote Record is not an image file of a ballot.\n\n108.     In 2002, The Federal Elections Commission's 2002 Voting System's Standards, Volume 1,\n\n\n\n52\n   See Attached Exhibit AA, Texas Secretary of State's Glossary of Election Terminology,\nhttp://www. sos. state. tx. us/elections/laws/glossary. shtml.\n53\n   See Exhibit K the Federal Election Commission's 1990 Performance and Testing Standard for Punchcard, Marksense,\nand Direct Recording Electronic Voting Systems.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                            p.31\n                                                                                                                     890\n\fPerformance Standards 54 (Exhibit L) reinforced and upheld these 1990 requirements for DRE's to\n\nmaintain two pathways independent from each other so that vote data is stored and ballot images are\n\npreserved (p. 31-Section 2.2.4.2, p. 60-Section 3.2.lb(2), and page 135-Section 9.5.1.2.a).\n\nTherefore, a Cast Vote Record is not an image of a ballot.\n\n109.       In addition, Contestee never proves that the Cast Vote Record electronic file or paper copy\n\nproduced by Travis County is an image file, is a replica of anything a voter sees when they are\n\nvoting, or that it meets the legal standards of an Official ballot. The Cast Vote Record that Travis\n\nCounty has produced is not produced from an official ballot, is not produced from an image of an\n\nofficial ballot, or produced from anything a voter saw or experienced when casting their electronic\n\nvote. Therefore, a Cast Vote Record is not a ballot image.\n\n110.       Perhaps most decisively, the Hart Intercivic manuals themselves concede that a CVR is not\n\na ballot image. Hart's own Ballot Now Operations Manual documentation 55 provided to Travis\n\nCounty states that the eScan subsystem scans each paper ballot to create an exact digital image of\n\nthe ballot cast. The eScan creates and stores a ballot image (a bitmap, .bmp file) and then reads the\n\ndata to make a Cast Vote Record (Ballot Now manual, Exhibit AB, page 24 and 259-260). In this\n\nway, the Travis County's Hart manual clearly refers to the CVR (a data structure used to transfer\n\ndata for tabulation in Tally) and the ballot image (bitmap, .bmp file) as two technically different\n\nthings. Therfore, a Cast Vote Record is not an image of a ballot.\n\n                          1. A Cast Vote Record is not the same as a Ballot Image\n\n111.       Paragraph 22-29, above, decisively establish that the Texas Secretary of State, the Federal\n\nElection Commission and Hart InterCivic all define \"ballot image\" and \"Cast Vote Record\" as\n\n\n\n54\n     See Exhibit L Elections Commission's 2002 Voting System's Standards, Volume 1, Performance Standards.\n55\n     Exhibit AB, Ballot Now Manual produced by Travis County.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                            p.32\n                                                                                                             891\n\fdistinctly different. 56 This, at a minimum, creates a fact issue as to whether a Cast Vote Record is an\n\nimage ofballot cast that is required by law to preserved and counted in recount and contest.\n\n112.    Additionally, the following Texas statutes show that the Legislature intended the word\n\n\"ballot image\" to have a specific meaning that is different from the meaning asserted for \"Cast Vote\n\nRecord.\"\n\n113.    The Texas Election Code, Sec. 128.00l(a)(2), reqmres that \"The secretary of state shall\n\nprescribe procedures to allow for the use of a computerized voting system. The procedures must\n\nprovide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main computer to coordinate\n\nballot presentation, vote selection, ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\" The language of the\n        . man d atory. 57\nstatute 1s\n\n114.    Thus, the statute requires any Travis County electronic voting system have all of those four\n\ncomponents: a main computer to coordinate a) ballot presentation, b) vote selection, c) ballot image\n\nstorage, and 4) result tabulation.\n\n115.     Importantly, this section of the Code was enacted in 1997, before the word \"Cast Vote\n\nRecord\" appears in any Federal Election Commission and Texas Secretary of State records, and\n\nbefore such a term could have acquired any \"technical or particular meaning.\" The words must\n\ntherefore be construed as required under the Code Construction Act \"Sec. 311.011. COMMON\n\n56\n   Exhibit AC, additionally, Casar misrepresents the definitions of Cast Vote Record and ballot image in the 2007\nElection Assistance Commission Spanish-English Glossary of Key Election Terminology by omitting relevant pages in\nExhibit AC. Those relevant pages are attached, however in Exhibit 6 to Exhibit 24 of the Amended MSJ, and provide\nthe false notion that the EAC defines \"ballot image\" and \"Cast Vote Record\" as synonymous. The relevant pages are\nfound in Exhibit AC, p. 15, 16,and 19.\n57\n   Texas Government Code (Code Construction Act) governs the use of the word.\n\n         Sec. 311.016. \"MAY,\" \"SHALL,\" \"MUST,\" ETC.

(a) Words and phrases shall be read in context and\n\nconstrued according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\" (emphasis added.)\n\nSee Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 1349, Sec. 50, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.\n\n116.     While Contestee mocks Pressley's use of the common usage of the word \"image\" as a\n\n\"picture,\" that is plainly the meaning contemplated by the Legislature in enacting the statute in 1997.\n\nA \"Cast Vote Record\" is nothing more than \"result tabulation\" referenced by the 1990 Federal\n\nElection Commission and contemplated by the 1997 statute. 58\n\n117.    This interpretation is subsequently supported by the 2002 Federal Election Commission\n\nreport (Exhibit L) and the Texas Secretary of State Glossary of Election Terms (Exhibit AA,\n\nhttp://www. sos. state. tx. us/elections/laws/ glossary. shtml, last visited March 15, 2015, 11 :36 a.m.)\n\ndefines as follows: \"Ballot Image: The ballot as it appears on a direct recording electronic (DRE)\n\nvoting system.\" No definition of \"Cast Vote Record\" appears in the Secretary of State's Glossary of\n\nElection Terms.\n\n118.    A genuine issue of material fact exists as to the central issue in this case: whether all four\n\ncomponents were provided in the conduct of the Runoff election in order to determine the victor in\n\nthe runoff. Plaintiffs assert the \"Cast Vote Record\" used in the Travis County Runoff election is not\n\nan \"image of a ballot cast.\" A side-by-side comparison of a Hart \"ballot image\" and \"cast vote\n\nrecord\" shows that the two are not the same.\n\n119.    The Cast Vote Record shown below (Exhibit AD) is authenticated in Exhibit D, Deposition\n\nof Dana DeBeauvoir, Exhibit 10, p. 42 lines 18-21.\n\n\n\n\n58\n  Alternatively, a CVR could also be described using the language of the FEC report, as a vote data storage pathway -\nessentially synonymous with \"results tabulation.\"\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                p.34\n                                                                                                                        893\n\f                                                                           \"Cast Vote Record\"\n                \"Ballot !mage' from Hart lnterCivic Ballot Now Manual\n                                                                        Produced by Travis Count<{\n                              Produced by Travis County\n\n\n                                                    !MIJ&JJif)!f\n\n\n\n\n          ao\n            ..\n          ;;;\n          .\n                   tl©..\n\n\n\n                   \"*\"\"!

Travis County admits that its system can only produce the easily-falsifiable Cast Vote\n\nRecords, not the more secure images of ballot cast required under the Texas Election Code\n\n(128.001a(2), 213.016).\n\n135.    During the recount, for the first time, it became apparent that Travis County had this illegal\n\ndefect in its procedures when Travis County only produced Cast Vote Records, and the election\n\nrecount supervisor stated that Travis County was incapable ofprinting images ofballots cast. 61\n\n136.    Because no ballot images were ever preserved, it is impossible for Travis County to produce\n\nand count the ballots, as required under the Tex. Constitution, Art. 6, Sec. 4, and Texas Election\n\nCode (213.016, 214.049(e)).\n\n13 7.   Because no ballot images were ever preserved, it is impossible for Travis County to conduct\n\na lawful recount the ballots, as required under the Texas Election Code (213.016, 214.049(e))\n\n138.    The ballot images must be preserved under the Texas Election Code. Failure to preserve\n\nballot images means that essential election records are missing.                  Such missing records make it\n\nimpossible for the tribunal to determine the outcome. In the event of such missing records, 62 an\n\norder to void the result and order a new election is appropriate.

Additionally, the evidence produced by Travis County shows that mistakes were made that\n\nmake it impossible for the tribunal to know the true outcome of the election.\n\n                                          Arguments and Authorities\n\n61\n   Attached Exhibit Z, Affidavit of Karen Renick, p.2\n62\n   DeBeauvoir confirmed that the election Tally system audit log is also missing data during Early Voting (Exhibit D,\nDeposition of Dana DeBeauvoir, p.76, line 7-15). In addition, DeBeauvoir confirmed that Travis County is also missing\nthe Results/Tally Tapes required by the Secretary of State. The SOS requires Results/Tally Tapes be printed when\nclosing the polls. When DeBeavoir was asked if the Runoff poll judges were told to not print Results/Tally tapes\ndirectly after the closing of the polls, her response was \"correct.\" (Exhibit M, Deposition of Dana DeBeauvoir, p. 128,\nline 15).\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                p.38\n                                                                                                                          897\n\f140.     \"The tribunal shall declare the election void if it cannot ascertain the true outcome of the\n\nelection.\" TEX.

The tribunal cannot ascertain the true outcome, because of\n\n                                                                           63\nevidence of mistakes and illegalities in the conduct of the election.\n\n141.     The largest and simplest illegality is plain. Travis County did not comply with the Texas\n\nElection Code requirement that, if it is to use a computerized voting system, it must use a system\n\n                             64\nwith ballot image storage.\n\nA CVR is not a \"Ballot Image.\"\n\n142.    As a matter of computer science, a CVR is not an \"image\" at all. Image files contain\n\ninformation not present in a CVR. The California report (Exhibit P, page 60, paragraph two) clearly\n\nstates that the CVR is a data structure. A data structure is a table or list of information, in this case,\n\na listing of the votes from one ballot. By contrast, an image file is a computer file which describes an\n\nimage as a grid of pixels, with color and other information for each pixel stored individually. A data\n\n                                                                                                           65\nstructure is not an image file, so the Cast Vote Record file is too small to be a ballot image file.\n\n143.    Image files are far larger than a Cast Vote Record .. \"A CVR is not ever more than 100 bytes\n\nlong (p 58, paragraph nine), which is more than enough room to hold a list of votes, at one byte per\n\nvote. But no image file format could do more than a dozen or so letters in 100 bytes; it certainly\n\n                                           66\ncould not hold an entire ballot image.\"         A CVR is nothing more than a simple data record. \"Hart's\n\nown documentation provided to Travis County states that the eScan subsystem scans each paper\n\nballot to create an exact digital image of the ballot cast.

In this way, the manuals clearly refer to\n\nthe CVR and the ballot image as two different things.\" 67 A CVR is not an image file.\n\n144.       Under Texas Statutes and constitution, a CVR is not a \"ballot image\" or \"image of\n\nballot cast.\"\n\n145.      A ballot image, as a matter of plain language, requires a \"Ballot\" and an \"image.\"\n\n146.      A ballot is defined through requirements set forth in the Texas Constitution and the Texas\n\nElection Code. It must possess:\n\n             a. a unique serial/ticket number (Texas Constitution, Article 6, Section 4 and Texas\n\n                  Election Code 52.062)\n\n             b. the election name (Texas Election Code 52.063), of Joint Special Runoff Election,\n\n                  Travis County\n\n             c. the election date (Texas Election Code 52.063), ofDecember 16, 2014,\n\n             d. the designation of Official Ballot (Texas Election Code 52.064)\n\n             e.   a voting square to the left of each candidate's name (Texas Election Code 52.070),\n\n                  and\n\n             f.   voting instructions (Texas Election Code 52.070, and 124.062)\n\n\n\n147.      The Texas Code Construction Act68 governs the interpretation of words in statutes.\n\n\"Sec. 311.011. COMMON AND TECHNICAL USAGE OF WORDS. (a) Words and phrases shall\n\nbe read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\" (emphasis\n\nadded.)\n\n\n67\n   See ExhibitS, Declaration of expert witness Jeffrey Jacobson, Ph.D. See also Hart Ballot Now manual, attached as\nExhibit AB, p. 24, 149, 259, 260\n68\n   Texas Government Code, Chapter 311.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.40\n                                                                                                                      899\n\f148. The word \"image\" is defined at http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ as: Image noun\nim·age \\'i-mij\\\n: a picture that is produced by a camera, artist, mirror, etc.\n:a mental picture: the thought of how something looks or might look\n: the idea that people have about someone or something\nFull Definition of IMAGE\n1: a reproduction or imitation of the form of a person or thing; especially : an imitation in solid\nform : statue\n2 a: the optical counterpart of an object produced by an optical device (as a lens or mirror) or an\nelectronic device\nb : a visual representation of something: as (1) : a likeness of an object produced on a photographic\nmaterial (2) : a picture produced on an electronic display (as a television or computer screen)\n3 a : exact likeness : semblance <God created man in his own image- Genesis 1:27(Revised\nStandard Version)>\nb : a person strikingly like another person <she is the image of her mother>\n4 a : a tangible or visible representation : incarnation <the image of filial devotion>\nb archaic : an illusory form : apparition\n5 a (1): a mental picture or impression of something <had a negative body image ofherself> (2):\na mental conception held in common by members of a group and symbolic of a basic attitude and\norientation <a disorderly courtroom can seriously tarnish a community's image of justice -Herbert\nBrownell>\n\nb : idea, concept\n6: a vivid or graphic representation or description\n7: figure of speech\n8: a popular conception (as of a person, institution, or nation) projected especially through the mass\nmedia <promoting a corporate image of brotherly love and concern- R. C. Buck>\n9: a set of values given by a mathematical function (as a homomorphism) that corresponds to a\nparticular subset of the domain\n\n149.   Thus, an \"image\" of a ballot cast, as \"construed according to the rules of grammar and\n\ncommon usage,\" would require a \"picture\" or \"reproduction\" or \"optical counterpart\" or \"visual\n\nrepresentation\" or \"exact likeness\" or \"image\" file, in something similar to a photograph, a bitmap,\n\nJpeg, pdf, tif, etc. or similar computer format.\n\n150.   The Texas Election Code, Sec. 128.001(a)(2), requires that \"The secretary of state shall\n\nprescribe procedures to allow for the use of a computerized voting system. The procedures must\n\nprovide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main computer to coordinate\n\nballot presentation, vote selection, ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\"\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                  p.41\n                                                                                                         900\n\f151.       A \"Cast Vote Record\" is nothing more than data storage file used for results tabulation. The\n\nTexas Government Code, Sec. 311.016(2) and (3) states:\n\n           \"MAY,\" \"SHALL,\" \"MUST,\" ETC. The following constructions apply unless the context in\n           which the word or phrase appears necessarily requires a different construction or unless a\n           different construction is expressly provided by statute:\n                   (2) \"Shall\" imposes a duty.\n                   (3) \"Must\" creates or recognizes a condition precedent.\n\n152.       Since Section 128.0001 ofthe Election Code states that the \"secretary of state shall prescribe\n\nprocedures [which] must provide for the use of a computerized voting system with ... (2) a main\n\ncomputer to coordinate ... ballot image storage,\" the ballot image storage is a condition precedent\n\nto the legal use of any computerized voting system.\n\n153.        Travis County has failed to comply with this condition precedent to the legal conduct of an\n\nelection. While this would theoretically affect other races decided in December of 2014, the statute\n\nof limitations has passed for all election contests save this one.\n\n154.       The Hart Electronic Voting system can, according to its manuals, store ballot images and\n\ncast vote records. 69 The sky will not fall if this Court orders Travis County to conduct this election\n\nin conformance with Texas Election Code, using capabilities that are already part of the Hart\n\nIntercivic Ballot Now system (Exhibit A, Attachment 6). Contests of all other elections that have\n\nbeen held are barred by limitations. According to the Hart Manual it is a simple fix to have the\n\nsystem preserve images of the ballots the voters use in deciding which candidate to vote for and that\n\nconforms to the legal definition of a ballot.\n\n155.       Further, the Texas Government Code, Sec. 311.021, states in pertinent part:\n\n           Sec. 311.021. INTENTION IN ENACTMENT OF STATUTES. In enacting a statute, it is\n           presumed that:\n\n                   (1) compliance with the constitutions of this state and the United States is intended;\n\n69\n     Exhibit AB, Hart Ballot Now Operations Manual p. 24, 149, 259, 260\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                       p.42\n                                                                                                            901\n\f                   (2)   the entire statute is intended to be effective;\n                   (3)   a just and reasonable result is intended;\n                   (4)   a result feasible of execution is intended; and\n                   (5)   public interest is favored over any private interest.\n\n\n156.     Because the \"ballot image storage\" is listed separately as a requirement in two different parts\n\nof the statute, it is a just and reasonable to construe the entire statute as operating under that feasible\n\nrequirement that an actual \"ballot image,\" instead of a mere tally of the \"Cast Vote Records,\" be\n\nretained in the system in order to promote the public interest in transparent elections in which a\n\nhuman being can look at an image of a ballot and count by hand accordingly in a Recount, in a\n\nmanner closely analogous to the way that ballots have been counted in America for centuries.\n\n157.       The private interest of saving money by using a system on the cheap that does not fulfill the\n\npublic purpose of transparent elections is disfavored.                       The purpose of the Election Code is to\n\nprovide an accurate and transparent method of electing representatives to government offices in a\n\nway that is both efficient and conducive to public faith in the process. 70\n\n158.

Because \"ballot image storage\" was not used by Travis County, as the statute requires, the\n\nballot images from the runoff election are missing election records and there are no ballots that can\n\nbe counted other than the Absentee/Mail in Ballots which resulted in a tie. Therefore the only true\n\noutcome that can be ascertained is a tie which requires a new election.\n\n       \"Election records\" also include ballot boxes (containing voted ballots), tally sheets,\n       absentee ballots, applications for absentee ballots in person and by mail, signature\n       rosters for election day voting, and poll lists.

Similarly, in this case, because the election records are missing, this honorable Court must\n\nvoid the election and order a runoff election between the Contestant and Contestee on voting\n\nmachines that \"use ballot image storage\" as required by Texas Election Code 128.001 (a).\n\nContestee's amended motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n\nThe unserious \"argument\" that erroneous agency interpretation can retroactively affect\n\nstatutory history.\n\n166.        Contestee alleges, in what can only be described as a preposterous parody of statutory\n\nconstruction, that an ex post facto application of agency construction of language that flies in the\n\nface of plain meaning rule and which undermines the relevant federal standards and produces a\n\nresult that is both absurd and at odds with the statutory intent is to control.\n                                                                                      71\n167.        It is uncontested that the relevant Texas statutes were enacted in 1997        and 2003. 72 Those\n\nstatutes require \"ballot image storage.\" and \"images of ballots cast.\"\n\n168.        In his motion for traditional summary judgment, Contestee attempts to create ambiguity in\n\nthe reading of the statutes by asserting that various administrative agencies, years after the\n\nenactment of the statutes at issue, have redefined the words of the statutes in ways that are\n\ninconsistent with plain language and inconsistent with the meaning of the statutes as understood at\n\n71\n     Texas Election Code, Sec. 128.00l(a)(2)\n72\n     Texas Election Code, Sec. 213.016\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                         p.45\n                                                                                                                904\n\fthe time of their enactment.\n\n169.   This is, to put it generously, a badly mistaken view of statutory construction.\n\n170.   Administrative redefinition of statutes is not allowed.\n\n171.   Under Texas case law, as set forth in R.R. Comm 'n of Tex. v. Tex. Citizens for a Safe Future &\n\nClean Water, 336 S. W3d 619, 625 (Tex. 2011), the Texas Supreme Court reaffirmed it's 20-year-old\n\nrule that limited the deference due to administrative determinations to those that are \"'reasonable and\n\ndo[] not contradict the plain language of the statute.'

The Safe Future Court added that \"this deference is tempered by several considerations:\"\n\n       It is true that courts give some deference to an agency regulation containing a reasonable\n       interpretation of an ambiguous statute. But there are several qualifiers in that statement.\n       First, it applies to formal opinions adopted after formal proceedings, not isolated\n       comments during a hearing or opinions [in a court brief]. Second, the language at issue\n       must be ambiguous; an agency's opinion cannot change plain language. Third, the\n       agency's construction must be reasonable; alternative unreasonable constructions do not\n       make a policy ambiguous.\n\n173.     The plain language ofthe statutes require an \"image\" of a \"ballot.\" A \"Cast Vote Record,\"\n\nas a mere data record is neither \"image\" nor \"ballot.\"\n\n174.

The application of the plain\n\nlanguage does not lead to absurd results. The plain language does not work an absurdity or manifest\n\ninjustice. Therefore, the Court must enforce the plain language requiring the storage and printing of\n\nimages ofballots cast.\n\n176.    Contestee argues that the plain meaning rule does not apply, because subsequent statements\n\nby administrative agencies contradict the plain meaning. In support of this notion, Contestee cites\n\nTexas Government Code 311.011 (b): \"Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or\n\nparticular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\"\n\n177.      First of all, it is obvious that there is no unanimous or consistent re-definition of a \"ballot\n\nimage\" as a \"Cast Vote Record\" at the federal level, or even within the Texas Secretary of State's\n\nOffice, or within the manuals of Hart InterCivic governing this very voting system. See supra,\n\nparagraphs 22-29.\n\n178.      Moreover, every suggestion of such a re-definition put forth by Contestee is dated AFTER\n\nthe statutes were enacted in 1997 and 2003. 73 It is impossible that documents published AFTER the\n\nstatutes were enacted were considered by the legislature, and intended to have effect in defining\n\n\n73\n   The Texas Secretary of State references cited are in 2012, 2014 and 2015. A single Election Assistance Commission\nreference, which is mischaracterized as described supra, is dated 2007. There is no evidence that the \"Words and\nphrases [] ha[ d] acquired a technical or particular meaning\" prior to statutory enactment.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                               p.47\n                                                                                                                       906\n\fstatutes written years before they were published. 74 The suggestion, once clearly explained, 1s\n\nobviously ludicrous.\n\n179.     If that were not enough reason to disregard the notion put forward by Contestee, the Safe\n\nFuture deference \"applies [only] to formal opinions adopted after formal proceedings, not isolated\n\ncomments during a hearing or opinions [in a court brief].\" (second bracket set in original.)\n\n180.     Contestee has put forward no evidence of any \"formal opinions adopted after formal\n\nproceedings,\" and has explicitly attempted to rely on a 2008 \"isolated comments during a hearing or\n\nopinions [in a court brief].\" These random droppings are due no deference by this court ..\n\n181.     Contestee also rests its notion that the SOS may willy-nilly redefine the words in statutes on\n\nSection 52.075 of the Election Code. That section allows the SOS to \"prescribe the form and content of\n\na ballot for a ... electronic voting system .. to conform to the formatting requirements of the system.\"\n\nThe limiting language in the provision does not allow the SoS to redefine the statute. The limiting\n\nlanguage allows the SoS to change the form and content merely to the extent required to conform with\n\nfom1atting requirements of a computer system. This is unsurprising, necessary, and nowhere near as\n\nbroad a grant of power as Contestee imagines. This allows the SoS to choose, for instance, among\n\nvarious image file formats. But it does not allow the SoS to ignore the requirement of Texas Election\n\nCode, Sec. 128.00l(a)(2) for \"a main computer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection,\n\nballot image storage, and result tabulation.\"                    How the SoS mandates compliance with the\n\n128.001(a)(2) elements is discretionary under 52.075.                      If   they mandate compliance with the\n\n128.00l(a)(2) elements is not made discretionary by 52.075. Further, the more specific provisions\n\nof Election Code Chapter 124, SubChapter C Electronic Voting System Ballot, trump 52.075. (e.g.,\n\n\n74\n  Tex. Const., Art. 1, Sec. 16. states that \"No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing\nthe obligation of contracts, shall be made.\" There is no reason to believe that retroactive administrative rulings are in\nsome way exempt from this rule.\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                                      p.48\n                                                                                                                              907\n\fthe electronic system ballot must be a different color than the sample ballot, § 124.062; specific\n\ninstructions are required, §124.062.)\n\n182.   A ballot is defined through requirements set forth in the Texas Constitution and the Texas\n\nElection Code. It must possess:\n\n           a. a unique serial/ticket number (Texas Constitution, Article 6, Section 4 and Texas\n\n                Election Code 52.062)\n\n           b. the election name (Texas Election Code 52.063), of Joint Special Runoff Election,\n\n                Travis County\n\n           c. the election date (Texas Election Code 52.063), ofDecember 16, 2014,\n\n           d. the designation of Official Ballot (Texas Election Code 52.064)\n\n           e.   a voting square to the left of each candidate's name (Texas Election Code 52.070),\n\n                and\n\n           f.   voting instructions (Texas Election Code 52.070)\n\n183.   The cast vote records do not fulfill these requirements.\n\n184.   Consequently, the Court must reject any \"cast vote records\" counted, produced and tallied\n\non election night and the recount because they do not meet the statutory standards of an Official\n\nBallot and cannot be verified as representing the voter's intent in the District 4 Runoff race. This is\n\nespecially true when the election tally is pervasively tainted s described above.\n\n185.   In addition, the Texas Election Code is very clear that \"ballots,\" \"images of ballots cast,\"\n\nand \"ballot images\" are to be counted and used to verify voters' intent when the election results\n\nare challenged. It is well known, that an actual digital, electronic image file in the form of various\n\ntypes such as a bitmap, pdf, jpg, png, etc. is a different type of file compared to a CVR dataset file.\n\nThe legislature's specific language of \"ballot image\" provides a secondary method for verifying\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                    p.49\n                                                                                                          908\n\fballot counts. Simply printing out the same CVR data to a predefined CVR template, and counting\n\nthose CVR's which is what was already electronically counted, is not a verification method.\n\n8.Re-canvass Should have Occurred with Mail in Ballots\n\n186.     The District 4 Austin City Council Election made material errors and should have been re-\n\ncanvassed using the results of the recount of the Mail in Ballots (240 for Pressley and 240 for\n\nCasar) and the election should have been declared a tie between Contestant Pressley and Contestee\n\nCasar.\n\n187.     Travis County failed to follow statutorily required recount procedures and recounted the\n\n3,937 votes which were illegal on two counts. Primarily, the 3,937 votes were not counted from\n\n\"images ofballots cast.\" Secondarily, the 3,937 votes were not original Cast Vote Records-they\n\nwere copies of Cast Vote Records that were aggregated into a pdf file that was generated in\n\nJanuary 2015. Travis County made material errors because the 3,937 votes cast on the eSlate are\n\nillegal on both counts and the final canvassed result, which was derived from these illegal votes, is\n\nnot the true outcome of the election; the true outcome is a tie.\n\n\n                                        III. CAUSE OF ACTION\n\n188.     Contestant incorporates paragraphs 1 through 76 of this Petition herein\n\n189.     The runoff election for City Council of the City of Austin, Precinct 4 must be voided\n\npursuant to Section 221.012 of the Texas Election Code and a new election held as described below\n\nbecause the true outcome cannot be ascertained or, in the alternative the only ballots cast in the\n\nelection meeting legal requirements of a ballot resulted in a tie.\n\n190.     The result of these multiple irregularities, mistakes and possibility of fraud is that the\n\nresult cannot be ascertained. The Court may request voters to disclose how they voted. Or, the\n\n\n\n\nPressley 61h Amended Election Contest                                                      p.50\n                                                                                                        909\n\fCourt may declare the election void without attempting to determine how voters voted (Texas\n\nElection Code 221.009) and call for a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such an election be\n\ntimely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Constitution and the Texas Election Code.\n\n191.     In Texas Constitution, Article 6, Section 4, \"In all elections by the people, the vote shall be\n\nby ballot...\" The Texas Election Code 52.001, also stipulates, \"the vote in an election is by\n\nofficial ballot. .. \" Ballots are defined in Texas Election Code Chapter 52, Subchapter C. 75\n\n192.     In addition, the Texas Election Code (xxx) is very clear that \"ballots,\" \"images of ballots\n\ncast,\" and \"ballot images\" are to be counted and used to verify voters' intent when the election\n\nresults are challenged. It is well known, that an actual digital, electronic image file in the form of\n\nvarious types such as a bitmap, pdf, jpg, png, etc. is a different type of file compared to a CVR\n\ndataset file. The legislature's specific language of\"ballot image\" provides a secondary method for\n\nverifying ballot counts. Simply printing out the same CVR data to a predefined CVR template,\n\nand counting those CVR's which is what was already electronically counted, is not a verification\n\nmethod.\n\n193.         Several election safeguards and procedures defined by the Legislature and the Secretary\n\nof State that are intended to prevent human errors were mistakenly not followed by Travis County.\n\nThe mistakes and failure to adhere to the Secretary of State's procedures led to and caused errors,\n\nand illegal votes to be counted, legal votes to be not counted, and the election outcome cannot be\n\n75\n   For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that subchapter are Sec. 52.003 and Sec. 52.070.\nSec. 52.003.

If no \"images of ballots cast\" can be retrieved, printed and counted, the true outcome of the\n\nelection cannot be ascertained. The Court may order each of the more than 4,000 voters who\n\nvoted in person to testify as to how they voted, pursuant to Texas Election Code\n\nSec. 221.010. \"SECONDARY                 EVIDENCE           FOR      UNAVAILABLE              BALLOTS.            If an\n\nexamination of ballots is needed in an election contest and the ballots are lost, destroyed, or\n\notherwise beyond the reach of the tribunal, the voters who cast the ballots may testify as to how\n\nthey voted.\"\n\n196.     In the alternative, if Travis County cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\" to be printed\n\nand counted, then Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and\n\nthe election is void. If the court does not count cast vote records because they are not images of\n\nanything defined by law as a ballot then it can ascertain the election to be a tie by counting the\n\nAbsentee/mail-In ballots either way as a matter of law, the Court must therefore order a new\n\nelection.

On Tuesday, December 301h, the Mayor and City Council of Austin conducted an official\n\ncanvass and certification of the Runoff results for all races on the December 16, 2014 ballot,\n\nincluding District 4. However a recount was conducted on January 6, 2015 and those results did\n\nnot change. The deadline for submission of a petition in an election contest is January 29, 2015.\n\nThe original petition was filed on or before that date and was timely filed.\n\n\n                                  VII.

INTRODUCTION\n\n1. Contestant moves this honorable Court to compel the Clerk of Travis County, Texas to\n\nprovide documents responsive to her requests for production. While there is some overlap,\n\nbasically, the Travis County Clerk has either failed to provide such responsive documents, made\n\nerroneous objections, or asserted privileges which do not comply with Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 193.\n\n2. Procedurally, Travis County has not provided evidence to support the privileges they assert\n\nas required by TRCP 193.4. Rule 193.4(a) requires that \"The party making the objection or\n\nclaim of privilege must present any evidence necessary to support the objection or privilege.\"\n\nThe privilege log provides no such evidence of the basis for the privileges asserted.     Mere\n\nassertions are not enough to preclude Travis County from providing the documents requested.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Motion to Compel                                                  p.l\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  4501\n\f3. Further, there are documents missing from the production requested that Travis County has\n\nasserted neither objection nor privilege. The responses are either unclear or incomplete. Since\n\nthere are no timely objections or assertions of privilege as to the unclear or incomplete responses,\n\nthe Travis County Clerk must provide the requested documents.\n\n4. Based on the pleadings, dispositive motions, and expert 1 impressions on file with this Court,\n\nthe documents sought by this motion to compel discovery responses are essential to Contestant's\n\ncase for a new election. Contestant's response to Contestee's motions for summary judgment\n\ndemonstrates potential corruption of the election process.      Contestant's expert describes the\n\nnecessity and materiality of the documents requested. The documents sought delve into the\n\ndetails of Travis County's process of conducting the December 2014 Runoff Election for City\n\nCouncil District 4 using electronirc voting machines and the proof that not only that the process\n\nitself was full of irregularities that materially affected the outcome, but that the process used by\n\nTravis County does not produce an \"image of a ballot cast\" as required by the Texas Election\n\nCode.\n\n5. Contestant moves the Court issue an order to compel Travis County to produce the\n\ndocuments for which it claimed privilege as well as documents that are missing or clarification\n\nof the response.\n\n6. Finally, should Travis County fail to comply with the Court's order, Contestant requests that\n\nthe Court award attorney's fees and costs associated with this motion\n\n\n\n\n1\n Exhibit F, Expert's Mental Impressions and Exhibit G, Expert's Declaration in Lieu of\nAffidavit.\n\nPressley v. Casar Motion to Compel                                                       p.2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       4502\n\f                  II. STANDARD TO COMPEL IN ELELCTION CONTEST\n\n7. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.1 states that \"When responding to written discovery, a\n\nparty must make a complete response, based on all information reasonably available to the\n\nresponding party or its attorney at the time the response is made.\" See In re Allied Chern. Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894877\"><a href=\"/opinion/894877/in-re-allied-chemical-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657 n.20 (Tex. 2007)(\"a party must make a complete response, based on all\n\ninformation reasonably available to the responding party or its attorney at the time the response is\n\nmade.\") Providing incomplete responses violates the Texas rules for discovery.\n\n8. To the extent privilege is asserted based on an agreement with one of the parties, the\n\nagreement itself cannot form the basis of a privilege when portions of the information therein are\n\ndiscoverable.

Refusal to provide these documents and access to the election software and hardware used\n\ncould deprive Contestant of evidence at trial relating to the actual malfunction of the electronic\n\nvoting system actually used.\n\n                                            III. FACTS\n\n\n10. On March 19, 2015, Contestant served her First Requests for Production to Travis County,\n\nTexas County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir, and she responded. See attached Exhibit A for the initial\n\nRequest for Production, Exhibit B for Court's Order, Exhibit C for Privledge Log, Exhibit D for\n\nEmail responses regarding repeated requests for Production The Travis County Clerk failed to\n\nprovide documents in response to the following specific requests that were originally granted by\n\nCourt (Exhibit E).\n\n11. On April 13, 2015, the Court held that the Clerk was not required to produce access to\n\nproprietary information or inspection of direct electronic voting machines, eSlate voting system,\n\nJudge's booth controllers, software or hardware used in conjunction with eState system directly\n\nto Pressley. In attempted compliance with the order, the Clerk withheld that information from\n\nproduction and the equipment from inspection.\n\n12. The Clerk provided the privilege log attached hereto as Exhibit C listing what it did not\n\nproduce and why.\n\n13. Of course, the documents and items the Court allowed the Clerk to withhold from direct\n\nunprotected production and inspection are not privileged except to the extent they constitute\n\ntrade secrets.   The Texas Supreme Court in In re Bass, 113 S. W3d 735 (Tex. 2003) set forth the\n\nstandard by which information may be considered a trade secret entitled to privilege:\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Motion to Compel                                                      p.4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4504\n\fWe have held that a trade secret is \"any formula, pattern, device or compilation of\ninformation which is used in one's business and presents an opportunity to obtain an\nadvantage over competitors who do not know or use it ... To determine whether a trade\nsecret exists, this Court applies the Restatement of Torts' six- factor test:\n\n       (1) the extent to which the information is known outside of his business; (2) the\n       extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in his business; (3) the\n       extent of the measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the\n       value of the information to him and to his competitors; (5) the amount of effort or\n       money expended by him in developing the information; (6) the ease or difficulty with\n       which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others ...\n\n14. There is no privilege for evidence termed \"proprietary.\" Indeed, everything is proprietary to\n\nsomebody. The Court in In re Continental General Tire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416508\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416508/in-re-continental-general-tire-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615 (Tex. 1998) held:\n\n       Trade secrets and confidential information are not necessarily ''privileged' matters\n       within the meaning of Rule 186a. If the information is material and necessary to the\n       litigation and unavailable from any other source, a witness may be required to make\n       disclosure.\n\n15. Some of the withheld information is not trade secrets and should be produced and their\n\ninspection does not violate a protectable trade secret.       Midstream, id.

Contestee's motion to strike and for sanctions must be denied. First, Contestee asks the\n\nCourt to strike Contestant's pleading based on lack of attachment of the lists referenced in the\n\npleading. Contestant made a good faith effort to amend her contest; the attachments were not, it\n\nturns out, accepted by the Court's electronic filing system, leaving the attachments off the filing.\n\nCounsel and Contestant were not aware that the electronic filing system had rejected the\n\nattachment to the 5th Amended Contest.\n\n2.     Second, a simple phone call or email from opposing counsel would have resulted in\n\nContestant's counsel emailing the attachments to them. As Contestant will show below, she has\n\ndone so. Constestee's counsel currently has in their possession the attachments Contestee asserts\n\nwere lacking, the basis of his motion to strike and sanctions.       Because Contestee has these\n\ndocuments in his possession, his claims that Contestant's assertions are groundless, are\n\nthemselves groundless.\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                       p.l\n                                                                                                       1525\n\f3.      Third, through discovery, Contestant has learned from Travis County's Audit Log for the\n\n2014 Runoff election that there were nine (9) mobile ballot boxes (MBB) from the Runoff\n\nelection were that were reported as corrupted. In addition to the fact the Contestee has the\n\ndocuments they claimed they lacked, the evidence that nine MBB' s were corrupted belies\n\nContestee's groundless claim.     Finally, the issues raised in Contestee's motion to strike are\n\naddressed, and therefore mooted, by Contestant's 6th Amended Petition. Contestee's motion\n\nmust be denied on the grounds set forth.\n\n\n\n     Error by Court Electronic Filing System in attaching the lists referenced in the pleading\n\n4.      Contestee complains that attachments referenced in the amended contest were missing\n\nfrom the filing.   Contestant made a good faith effort to cure the defects of her previous contest\n\nbased on the Court's order on special exception. Contestant attached the exhibits reference in\n\nContestee's Motion to Strike to the filing of her 5th Amended Contest. The Court's electronic\n\nfiling system did not accept the attachments as part of the system. See Exhibit A, Declaration of\n\nDavid Rogers with Attachment 1, E-FILETEXAS.GOV Email notice of Submission Failure\n\n4962344 included herein by reference as if fully set forth.\n\n5.      Neither Contestant nor her counsel were aware of the failure of the system to accept the\n\nexhibit attachments until Contestee's counsel filed this motion. Had counsel conferred with\n\nContestant's counsel regarding the missing exhibits, Contestant's counsel would have\n\nimmediately provided same. Contestant, through counsel, emailed the rejected attachments to\n\ncounsel for Contestee. See Exhibit B, Declaration of Charlotte Secord with Attachment 2, Email\n\nof 5th Amended Contest attachments to Contestee's counsel included herein by reference as if\n\nfully set forth.\n\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                        p.2\n                                                                                                       1526\n\f6.     The Court cannot strike the pleadings of a party that makes a good faith effort to cure\n\ndefects in their pleading. Humphreys v.

Chapter 10 specifies that one of the aims for imposition of\n       sanctions for the filing of frivolous or groundless pleadings is to \"deter repetition\n       of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.\"). (Citations\n       omitted)\n\n\n8.     More importantly, the court in Peltier expounded on the standard for the award of\n\nattorney's fees for sanctions:\n\n       In determining whether sanctions are appropriate, the trial court must examine the\n       facts available to the litigant and the circumstances existing when the litigant filed the\n       pleading Courts should presume parties and their counsel file all papers in good faith,\n       and the party seeking sanctions must overcome that presumption. The party seeking\n       sanctions has the burden of showing its right to relief. (Citations omitted.)\n\nSee also Nath v. Tex.

Even in a case such as this, where the sanction is sought pursuant to CPRC 10.01 et. seq.,\n\nthe burden is on the party seeking sanctions to prove that the pleading is groundless, i.e., that the\n\nfact alleged could not be proved factually or there is no legal basis.

Henry, 221 S. W3d 609,614 (Tex. 2007).\n\n\n10.     In this case, the sole basis for Contestee's motion is that Contestant allegedly failed to attach\n\nthe documents referred to in the Sth Amended Contest. As shown above, not only was the lack of\n\nattachments simply an electronic clerical error, Contestant has provided Contestee's counsel with the\n\ndocuments supporting Contestant's claims in her Sth Amended Contest (with a copy to the Court)\n\nrejected by the Court's e-filing system.\n\n11.     Counsel for Contestee could have swiftly and easily remedied the confusion by a phone call\n\nor email to counsel for Contestant for the attachments referenced in Contestant's Sth Amended\n\nContest. Instead, Contestee's counsel has chosen to exercise the resources of this Court to basically\n\naccomplish the same result.\n\n\nGroundlessness Belied by Corrupted Mobile Ballot Boxes\n\n\n12.     On May 11, 201S, counsel for Contestant deposed the Travis County, Texas County Clerk,\n\nDana DeBeauvoir regarding, among other things, the electronic voting system used in the 2014\n\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                           p.4\n                                                                                                            1528\n\fTravis County Runoff election. Among the exhibits about which she was deposed was the Official\n\nAudit Log for the December 16, 2014 Joint Special Runoff Election. See attached Exhibit C.\n\n13.     Therein, Contestant discovered entries for MBB's identified as corrupted. Below is a chart\n\nthat references the page numbers on which the corrupted MBB' s are listed:\n\n        Page                       Date                       Time                  Description\n\n5                       12/16/14                   12:30:00 pm               Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n22                      12/16/14                   8:34:45 pm                Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n23                      12/16/14                   8:42:16                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n23                      12/16/14                   8:42:43                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n26                      12/16/14                   8:53:36                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n27                      12/16/14                   8:57:04                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n27                      12/16/14                   8:57:04                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n29                      12/16/14                   9:09:34                   Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n42                      12/16/14                   10:12:44                  Invalid/Corrupt MBB\n\n\n\n14.     These nine entries on Travis County's 2014 Runoff election audit log clearly indicate that the\n\nmobile ballot boxes were either invalid or corrupted. The corrupt MBBs contained Runoff election\n\nvotes which mayor may not have been properly included in the Runoff election count and recount.\n\nRegardless, Contestants allegation and factual contention that corruption of votes in the corrupted\n\nTravis County electronic voting system in her contest has, or is likely to have, evidentiary support\n\nafter a reasonable investigation. Peltier, id.; Nath, id.    Because there is no basis for a groundless\n\npleading claim, Contestee's motion to strike and sanctions must be denied.\n\n\n\n\nPressley Response To Casar's Motion To Strike Pleadings And For Sanctions                          p.5\n                                                                                                          1529\n\fContestee's motion to strike addressed and mooted by Contestant's 6th Amended Petition\n\n15.

In support of this election contest, Dr. Pressley will respectfully\n\n     show as follows:\n\n                                             I. DISCOVERY\n\n1.        The contestant intends that discovery be conducted under level three, a custom discovery\n\nplan for election contest devised with the approval of the court.\n\n                                  II. REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE\n\n2.        Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, and the motion set forth below, the plaintiff\n\nrequests that the defendants, within thirty days of the service of the Original Petition, disclose the\n\ninformation and material described in Rule 194.2.\n\n                                             III. SUMMARY\n\n3.         This contest is based on the facts that illegal votes were counted, election officers prevented\n\neligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal votes, and election officers made\n\nmistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true outcome. Thus, deprivation of\n\nvoting rights of voters in several high population polling locations which were improperly closed,\n\nirregularity in votes counted or not counted, and a failure to comply with the Texas Election Code\n\nrequirement for storing, retrieval and printing of \"images of ballots cast\" in electronic voting\n\nmachines occurred and negatively affected the outcome for Pressley. Particularly, the improper\n\nclosure, consolidation and moving of the voting locations alone appears to have reduced the vote\n\nconsiderably more than the margin reported in the canvass of the election. 2\n\n4.        Additionally, Travis County uses electronic voting machines from Hart Intercivic to conduct\n\n\n\n2This is sufficient to \"materially affect[] the election results.\" Gonzalez v.

Pressley requests that the court compel Travis County election officers\n\nto print the \"images of ballots cast\" as required under the Texas Election Code. 4 (TEX. ELEC. CODE\n\n§213.016). Without these statutorily-required \"images of ballots cast\" it is impossible for the Court\n\nto determine the actual election outcome, as the only actual ballots - the mail-in ballots - are exactly\n\nand perfectly tied between the two candidates. The Travis County Clerk has asserted that the system\n\nTravis County uses cannot print \"images of ballots cast.\" Images of ballots cast\" is not the same as\n\n\"cast vote records.\" The Court, consequently, must reject any \"cast vote records\" produced and\n\ntallied by such machines. The result of these multiple irregularities is that the result cannot be\n\nknown, and the Court must order a new election. Dr. Pressley requests that such an election be\n\ntimely set, and conducted in compliance with the Texas Election Code and the Secretary of State's\n\nregulations governing elections.\n\n5.     \"The purpose of the election code is to ensure that the true will of the voters is 'fairly expressed'\n\nand that the evidence of that expression is 'properly preserved.'

The failures and mistakes illustrated\n\nin this Contest show that the will of voters was thwarted, the evidence of that expression was not\n\nproperly preserved and thus, the true outcome cannot be determined. 5\n\n6.        While some actual ballots were preserved - the mail-in ballots, in which the candidates are\n\nperfectly tied - the vast majority of ballots and the evidence of the voters' intent were not preserved.\n\nAccording to the Travis County Clerk, there are no \"images of ballots cast\" that the court can\n\nreview. Therefore, if \"images of ballots cast\" cannot be produced, we request the court to order a\n\nnew election.\n\n\n                                             IV. PARTIES\n\n7.        Contestant Laura Pressley is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis County,\n\nTexas. She was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on December 16,\n\n2014.\n\n8.        Contestee Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar is a resident of Austin City Council District 4, Travis\n\nCounty, Texas.      He was a candidate in the Austin City Council District 4 Run Off Election on\n\nDecember 16,2014. Casar has been served and has answered in this cause.\n\n9.        The election results were canvassed on December 30, 2014 and Mr. Casar was declared the\n\nvictor.\n\n10.       A \"manual recount\" of all early voting, election day, provisional, and mailed-in ballots was\n\nattempted on January 6, 2015. 6 The mail-in ballots were exactly tied between the candidates, at 240\n\n\n\n5 The requirement to preserve \"images of ballots cast\" in the statute is fundamental to preserving the\nevidence of the will of the voters. By failing to preserve that evidence, the County has destroyed\nevidence of the expression of the will of the voters and forced the court to call a new election.\n6 Though the County Clerk termed the action a \"manual recount,\" because the event as it occurred\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.4\n                                                                                                           1541\n\feach, for a total of 480 votes. 7 The attempted recount was a nullity and a real recount was made\n\nimpossible in that the attempted recount violated state law and was incorrectly performed using of the\n\n\"cast vote records\" in lieu of \"images of ballots cast\" combined with the actual mail in ballots. Based\n\non the counting of \"cast vote records\" and mail in ballots, as could be predicted, the invalid recount did\n\nnot change the reported results of the election and the original declaration of Mr. Casar as the victor for\n\nthe run off election did not change.

Jurisdiction and venue in this case are proper and mandatory in Travis County because\n\nthe office being sought is for a district entirely within the boundaries of Travis County under the\n\nTexas Elections Code, Section 232.006.\n\n                                               VI. FACTS\n\n            Travis County Election Officials Prevented Eligible Voters from Voting\n\n12.     City of Austin District 4, comprised of 18 voting precincts, is located entirely           III   Travis\n\nCounty. Early Voting and Election Day was December 1-12, and 16, 2014, respectively.                     Voters\n\nseeking to vote at high-volume locations were improperly denied the right to cast their vote.\n\nDisenfranchisement of District 4 voters occurred as a result of the closing of the highest volume\n\nDistrict 4 voting locations in the Run Off during Early Voting and Election Day, December 16,\n\n\ndid not satisfy statutory criteria, Pressley does not concede that what occurred was actually a\nstatutory manual recount as defined by the Texas Election Code.\n7 These were the only actual ballots counted during the \"manual recount.\" The mail-in ballots were\nmore than 10% of the total ballots cast in the election. The allegation of the county is that, despite\nthe perfect tie in mail-in ballots, Casar beat Pressley by a 2-to-1 margin in the remaining ballots.\nThis is a variation in election results that is highly improbable and unrecorded to Contestant's\nknowledge.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                   p.5\n                                                                                                                  1542\n\f2014.\n\n13.     The Highland Mall voting location at 6601 Airport Blvd was open during the General\n\nElection for Early Voting and Election Day on October 20-31, and November 4, 2014,\n\nrespectively and saw some of the highest volume of voters in District 4. This location was the\n\ndesignated voting location for Precinct 142 and was an important and convenient voting location\n\nfor Precinct 156 and others nearby. It was closed for the December Run Off election for Early\n\nVoting and Election Day. It was moved to the far less convenient Travis County Tax Office at\n\n5501 Airport Blvd (See Appendix 1). The Pressley campaign received multiple reports of voters\n\nbeing upset and confused because the voting location had been moved.\n\n14.     Specifically, reports were received by Contestant on Election Day, December 16th , from\n\nvoters while Contestant was phone banking. District 4 voter, Thomas Crawford showed up at\n\nCooke Elementary to vote, and reported no signs were posted to indicate where the polling\n\nlocation had been moved. Similar reports were received by Brad Parsons, a campaign volunteer,\n\nwho was phone banking on Election Day. Campaign supporter, Matthew Palmer reported that\n\nHighland Mall was closed and it was a problem for voters.        Based on information and belief,\n\nContestant asserts that said confusion was a result of failure to post, or premature removal of, a\n\nnotice at Cooke Elementary, Precinct 222, of the relocation of the polling place.\n\n15.     Upon reviewing voter rolls for Pct 156 and 142, published by Travis County, Appendix 2\n\nshows names, addresses and precincts of 365 voters of Pcts 156 and 142 that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 365 voters were identified based on their voting histories which include\n\nbut are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary\n\nElections. The extensive voting histories of these 365 voters show they are the most consistent\n\nvoters in Precincts 142 and 156 and surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                           p.6\n                                                                                                     1543\n\fin 2014.   In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters, multiple times, as very\n\nstrong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs posted), who were waiting\n\nto vote on Election Day. These voters total 73. Therefore, Contestant alleges a total of 438 voters\n\nin Precincts 142 and 156 were disenfranchised.\n\n16.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (detailed voter information of\n\nprecincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting in the General and\n\nRun off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County.      Upon receipt and\n\nreview of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify additional voters and\n\nimprove the accuracy of this list.    Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of collecting\n\naffidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n17.    The second highest voting precinct and polling location in District 4 for the November\n\nGeneral Election was Precinct 222 at Cooke Elementary located at 1511 Cripple Creek. That\n\nPrecinct is comprised of more than 25% senior voters who are 60 years and older. It was closed\n\nduring Election Day for the December Run Off (See Appendix 1). It was combined with the\n\nfourth lowest voter turnout location in District 4, Precinct 268, Grant AME Worship Center at\n\n1701 Kramer Lane.\n\n18.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Rob Hale, a resident and voter in Pct 222.\n\nAs usual, he and other Pct 222 voters showed up to Cooke Elementary for the December Run Off\n\non Election Day and were confused as to why Cooke Elementary was closed for voting for Pct\n\n222. He helped senior voters look up an alternative location in which to vote on Kramer Lane.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Kramer location, he waited for the senior voters and they did not arrive. In\n\naddition, he had a relative that showed up at Cooke Elementary to vote, and the relative reported\n\nno signs were posted to indicate where the polling location had been moved.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.7\n                                                                                                       1544\n\f19.    Upon reviewing Pct 222 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 3 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 248 voters that we allege were disenfranchised. These 248 voters have\n\nvoting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of Austin\n\nCouncil Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 248 voters show\n\nthey are the most consistent voters in Precinct 222 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City\n\nCouncil Run off election in 2014.     In addition, the Pressley campaign verified additional voters,\n\nmultiple times, as very strong Pressley supporters (by block walking/phone banking/yard signs\n\nposted), which were waiting to vote on Election Day. These voters total 71. Therefore, Contestant\n\nalleges a total of319 voters in Precinct 222 alone were disenfranchised.\n\n20.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (such as detailed voter\n\ninformation such as precincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting\n\nin the General and Run off elections), has been requested through Discovery from Travis County.\n\nUpon receipt and review of Discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify\n\nadditional voters and improve the accuracy of this list. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process\n\nof collecting affidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n21.    Another voting location open during the General Election but closed for the District 4 Run\n\noff was Precinct 133, which was open for the General Election at Blanton Elementary located at\n\n5408 Westminster. It was combined with the non-District 4 Precinct 130, at Memorial UMC.\n\n22.    The Pressley campaign received reports from Pct 133, Election Judge, Arthur Turner, a\n\nresident and voter in Pct 133. During Election Day, voters from Pct 133, showed up at Blanton\n\nElementary to vote in the Run Off and were confused and upset as to why Blanton Elementary was\n\nclosed for voting for Pct 133. Mr. Turner had multiple calls from upset voters who did not know\n\nwhere to vote.\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.8\n                                                                                                         1545\n\f23.    Upon reviewing Pct 133 voter rolls published by Travis County, Appendix 4 shows names,\n\naddresses and precincts of 116 voters Contestant alleges were disenfranchised. These 116 voters\n\nhave voting histories which include but are not limited to voting in General Elections, City of\n\nAustin Council Elections, and Primary Elections. The extensive voting histories of these 116\n\nvoters show they are the most consistent voters in Precinct 133 and they surprisingly did not vote\n\nin the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n24.    To enhance the accuracy of this list, additional information (such as detailed voter\n\ninformation such as precincts, ballot styles, voting histories, and voting locations for those voting\n\nin the General and Run off elections), has been requested through discovery from Travis County.\n\nUpon receipt and review of discovery responses from Travis County, Contestant may identify\n\nadditional voters and improve the accuracy of this list. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process\n\nof collecting affidavits regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n25.    Three additional polling locations were closed for the Run off election for District 4 (Pcts\n\n209, 258, and 260).     Upon reviewing the voter rolls for these precincts published by Travis\n\nCounty, Appendix 5 shows names, addresses and precincts of 235 voters that we allege were\n\ndisenfranchised. These 235 voters have voting histories which include but are not limited to\n\nvoting in General Elections, City of Austin Council Elections, and Primary Elections.             The\n\nextensive voting histories of these 235 voters show they are the most consistent voters in Precincts\n\n209,258, and 260 and they surprisingly did not vote in the City Council Run off election in 2014.\n\n26.    The total number of closed/moved/combined precincts in District 4 for the Run off comes\n\nto a total of 7 Precincts out of 17 voting precincts in District 4. Therefore, 41 % of District 4's\n\npolling locations were closed, combined or moved for the December Austin City Council Run off.\n\nAppendix 6. This caused a much lower than expected turnout for Election Day for District 4.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                               p.9\n                                                                                                         1546\n\f27.    To summarize, typically Election Day and Early Voting tum out is very similar. Early\n\nVoting for the District 4 Run Off race saw approximately 2,646 voters and on Election Day only\n\n1,771 turned out. Due closing/ moving/ combining of 41 % of District 4 Polling locations, voters\n\nwere confused and disenfranchised and Election Day voters were about 875 short.\n\n28.    The County's actions of closing multiple, key, high volume polling locations had a\n\ndisproportionate effect on minorities, working people, and elderly voters of District 4-one of the\n\nHispanic-opportunity districts in the City of Austin.        Four of Pressley's strongest voting\n\nlocations/boxes that showed over 50% for Pressley (222, 156, 133, 258), as evidenced by the only\n\nremaining ballots, Mail in Ballot results, were moved or closed for the Run Off election (See\n\nAppendix 6).\n\n\n\n29.    As a result of these aggressive and improper closures, voters registered at those locations\n\nwere improperly denied the right to cast their vote. The closure of these pro-Pressley precincts was\n\nunfair and undermined the true outcome of the election. A conservative count of disenfranchised\n\nvoters resulting from the improper closure/moving/combining of precincts 133, 142, 156, 209,\n\n222, 258, and 260 is 1,108. This value is consistent with the low voter turnout on Election\n\nDay as compared to Early Voting. Upon evaluation of discovery responses from Travis County,\n\na more accurate number may be provided. Also, for trial, Contestant is in the process of obtaining\n\ntestimony regarding disenfranchisement specifics from these voters.\n\n\n\nTravis County Election Officials Allowed Ineligible Voters to Cast Votes (Illegal Votes)\n\n30.       A thorough review the 4,414 Early Voting and Election Day voter names and addresses\n\nwith returned mail, and the National Change of Address database (NCOA), and voter registration\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.lO\n                                                                                                       1547\n\frecords available online, 64 of the voters had moved, no longer resided in District 4, or had some\n\nother residency issues, and may not have been eligible to vote in the District 4 Run Off Election.\n\nTherefore, at least 64 ineligible voters cast votes in this election due to residency issues. A\n\nmore detailed review of the voter registrar information provided by Travis County is needed with\n\nregard to Provisional Ballots, statements of residence, etc. Upon evaluation of Discovery\n\nresponses from Travis County, a more accurate number may be provided. A list of the 64 voter's\n\nVoter ID's and precincts are found in Appendix 7.\n\n31.    \\Vith regard to additional categories for illegal votes, it is unlikely that voters that are not\n\ninterested in voting in a General Election will be interested in voting in a Run Off election. After\n\nreviewing Travis County voter rolls (https:lltax-office.traviscountytx.gov/voter-data), for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off, 156 voters voted in the Run Off that did not vote in the General\n\nElection. Many are Ballot by Mails and a large number voted at specific locations. These are\n\npotentially illegal votes and we ask the court to allow Contestant time to review and evaluate\n\nvarious Discovery responses from Travis County voting records including, but not limited to,\n\nBallot by Mail, voter registration cards, polling location sign in sheets, and residency records, etc.\n\nto validate the votes were cast legally. A List of these voters are found in Appendix 8.\n\n                 More Ballots Than Voters During Early Voting (megaI Votes)\n\n32.    On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, the Mayor of Austin and the Austin City Council\n\nconducted an initial official canvass and certification for the Election Day results for all races\n\non the ballot, including City of Austin District 4. The canvassed and certified totals for District\n\n4 were Laura Pressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n33.    The canvassed results were inconsistent with the Early Voting voter reports. Travis County\n\nreported that 2,651 total voters voted in Early Voting in District 4. Reviewing the voter ID's, 437\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.ll\n                                                                                                          1548\n\fentries existed for those submitting Ballot by Mail (BBM). There were at least 28 duplicate entries for\n\nBBM. At least 28 mail-in votes appear to have been counted twice or three times. See Appendix 6,\n\nDuplicate Ballot by Mail Entries.\n\n34.     Once duplicate BBM's were removed, 2,622 voter names remained that voted in Early Voting\n\naccording to the Early Voting lists from Travis County that were distributed prior to Election Day,\n\nDecember 16, 2014. Based on Travis County's Canvassed and Recount results for those that voted for\n\nGreg Casar, or Laura Pressley or Under Voted, the total number of ballots cast for Early Voting is\n\n2,701. Therefore, there are 80 more ballots than voters for Early Voting. These 80 extra ballots are\n\ndistributed among 15 of the 18 precincts of the District 4 Race. 8 (One precinct, with one eligible voter,\n\nshowed no votes.) See Appendix 7, Early Voting Discrepancies.\n\n                                      Statistical Improbabilities\n\n35.    An analysis of the voting results show a pattern of mathematical anomalies which is highly\n\nunlikely to occur naturally. (See Appendix 8, pages 1-3.) For the nine (9) precincts in District 4\n\nwith more than 200 voters,9 the highest volume of voters, the ratio of votes that the Contestant\n\nreceived compared to Contestee is the same ratio in the November General Election (with a total\n\nof 8 candidates) as it was in the December Run Off Election (with 2 candidates), 35.1 % vs 35.0%\n\nrespectively.   In addition, the average of the percentages of the unweighted precincts that the\n\nContestant received compared to Contestee, in the November General Election and the December\n\nRun Off, are also equal at 35.1 % and 35.1 %, respectively. No other Council race in the history of\n\nelectronic voting in the City (2003 - current) has shown such a tight non-variation between a\n\n\n8 In the original petition, this number was identified as 79. One precinct, 211, had a single vote\nundervote. See Appendix 7, Early Voting Discrepancies.\" Additionally, there are an unknown\nnumber of ballot by mail overvotes, invalid voter registrations, ineligible voters and election day\novervotes.\n9 These precincts account for more than 80% of the vote in the District.\n\n\nPressley v.

See\n\nattached Appendix 8, Comparison of Election Returns.\n\n36.     The fact that so many precincts showed exactly the same and unchanged results for the General\n\nElection and the Run Off is indicative of mistakes made by Travis County election officers. These\n\nmistakes are likely related to and are due to, but not limited to, the handling of voter hardware,\n\nsoftware, etc.\n\n37.         From Travis County Voter Rolls, though over 4,000 voters were different between the\n\nGeneral and Run Off elections, the unique and unlikely occurrence that the results remain unchanged\n\nand which has not occurred in the last 11 years in Travis County for any other Run Otf candidate or\n\nelection is highly improbable. The occurrence is surprising, is strictly isolated to District 4, and is\n\nindicative of human error. Because so many high volume District 4 precincts showed exactly the same\n\npercentage results for Pressley and Casar, it is possible that some memory cards or counting software\n\nused in the General Election were mistakenly reused in error for the Run Off.\n\n38.         Contestee Casar alleges the factual and statistically improbable election results for the\n\nGeneral Election and the Run Off \"are unsurprising.\" This is indicative of emotional wishful thinking\n\nrather than a clear-eyed analytical assessment of evidence and data. Additionally, Casar offers vague\n\nand irrelevant references and personal attacks from a politically biased news source, the far-left Austin\n\nChronicle. The Chronicle endorsed and directly campaigned for Contestee Casar. Additionally, the\n\nChronicle has little to no scientific expertise on staff that is qualified to offer expert testimony on\n\ncomplex topics of mathematics, chemistry, physics and engineering, which they attempt to report and\n\ncritique.\n\n39.

Several election safeguards and procedures defined by the Legislature and the Secretary of\n\nState that are intended to prevent human errors were mistakenly not followed by Travis County. The\n\nmistakes and failure to adhere to the Secretary of State's procedures led to and caused illegal votes to be\n\ncounted.\n\n41.        With regard to the counting of illegal votes, during Early and Election Day Voting, many\n\nelection irregularities occurred and mistakes were made by Travis County election officers.\n\nAccording to Travis County Election Division director Michael Winn, no Zero Tapes to were printed\n\nfor machines to verify that directly prior to the first votes being cast, no votes were pre-registered on\n\n\n10 A \"zero tape\" is run on the Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") to ensure no votes reside in the\n\nsystem. When voters arrive they are given a JBC-generated PIN number that they enter on the\neSlate. They then vote and the votes are stored on the eSlate, Mobile Ballot Boxes (MBB), and JBC.\n\n\nPressley v.

The eSlate system is comprised of several\ndistinct components.\nThe Ballot Origination Software System (\"BOSS\") is used by election officials to define and create\nindividualized electronic ballots. Data is entered once into BOSS and then flows through all\ncomponents of the eSlate system.\nThe Mobile Ballot Box (\"MBB\") is a reusable, portable flash memory card. It is used to store and\ntransfer election information. When inserted into the Judge's Booth Controller, the MBB supplies\nelection information and ballot styles, it stores an electronic representation of how votes were cast.\nOnce voting has concluded the MBB is removed and its contents are tallied by the Tally software.\nThe Judge's Booth Controller (\"JBC\") is the \"brain\" that manages the system, enabling poll workers\nto know which voting booths are in use at any time. The JBC issues access codes for the voters' use.\nIt can control up to 12 daisy-chained eSlate units.\neSlate refers to the system generally and to the device that voters use to cast ballots, unless using\npaper ballots, in which case Ballot Now is used. The eSlate may be equipped with a disabled access\nunit (\"DAU\") for use by disabled voters. The eSlate units are physically connected to the JBC,\nwhich stores cast-vote records.\nTally is a software application that reads, stores, and tabulates the cast-vote records from the MBB\n(the portable flash card that transferred the cast-vote records from the JBC). Tally tabulates all early\nvoting, absentee, and election day results, and produces various reports.\nRally is a software application that is capable of reading, storing, and transferring cast-vote data\nfrom polling places or collection centers with respect to early returns.\nThe System for Election Records and Verification Operations (\"SERVO\") software is an election\nrecords archiving and asset management system. SERVO is designed to recover data from\nequipment in the case of a lost or damaged MBB. SERVO also is designed for various recount\npurposes.\nBallot Now is a digital-scan paper ballot system that manages the printing, scanning, and resolution\nof mailed-in paper ballots. It also records the electronic cast vote records to an MBB to be read and\ntabulated with Tally.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                  p.l7\n                                                                                                           1554\n\f                                             The Recount\n\n                                        Illegal Votes Counted\n\n47.    Because of the previously noted, highly improbable statistical anomalies l3 , the duplicate\n\nBallot by Mail entries, and the fact that there are more ballots than number of voters for Early\n\nVoting (overvotes), Contestant requested a manual recount of the Di strict 4 Election with the goal\n\nof reconciling the discrepancies.\n\n48.        Contestant claims the recount evidence and findings are critically material to this case\n\nand the allegations are legally relevant to this election contest.\n\n49.    The recount failed to only count legal votes because \"images of ballots cast\" were not\n\nprovided and counted.      Printing the \"cast vote record\" or \"CVR\" data files was in essence\n\nreprinting the previous electronically counted results obtained on Election night. A CVR prints\n\ndata from a data file to a template; it does not count the \"images of ballots cast\" - it merely\n\nreprints the tally on separate sheets of paper. It was not recounting the source data of the \"images\n\nof ballots cast,\" and as such it is not a meaningful check on the original count. 14 Using the CVR\n\n\n13 See Appendix 8.\n14 The Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (All dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.) In its 2014 Electronic Voting System\nProcedures bulletin, posted online at                  .\n                           the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot\nimages. See, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8 - Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEC § 214.071):\n1. The candidate requesting a recount may request that the recount be done electronically or\n        manually.\n2. For an electronic recount, the persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n        also authorized to be present as the election media are reloaded into the central accumulator\n        system.\n3. For a manual recount of a DRE election, the Recount Coordinator shall organize the printing of\n        cast vote records (ballot images) for the affected race or issue.\n\n\nPressley v.

Printing the CVR data files was in essence\n\nreprinting the previous electronically counted results obtained on Election night. A CVR is a\n\nprinting of a data file to a template - it does not \"count\" the images of ballots - it merely reprints\n\nthe tally on separate sheets of paper. It was not recounting the source data of the \"images of\n\nballots cast,\" and as such it is not a meaningful check on the original count. 18 Using the CVR\n\ninstead of ballot image also appears to violate Texas Election Code 214.049 (e): \"If electronic\n\nvoting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original ballot, rather than the duplicate\n\n18 Secretary of State is somewhat unclear on this issue. While \"images of ballots cast\" could be\nconsidered as a subset of the category \"cast vote records,\" the CVRs in this case are not, in fact,\nimages. In logical terms, the expression would be that just because all A are B does not mean all B\nare A. (All dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.) In its 2014 Electronic Voting System\nProcedures bulletin, posted online at\n                             the SOS appears to not clearly differentiate cast vote records from ballot\nimages. See, e.g., Section 8:\nSection 8 - Requested Recounts (if necessary)\nRequested Recount on DRE Voting Systems (Pursuant to TEe § 214.071):\n4. The candidate requesting a recount may request that the recount be done electronically or\n        manually.\n5. For an electronic recount, the persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n        also authorized to be present as the election media are reloaded into the central accumulator\n        system.\n6. For a manual recount of a DRE election, the Recount Coordinator shall organize the printing of\n        cast vote records (ballot images) for the affected race or issue.\na.         The Recount Coordinator shall notifY the parties in the recount of the date, place, and time\n                 the printing of cast vote records (ballot images) will take place.\nb.         The full recount committee is not required to be present at the printing of cast vote records\n                 (ballot images) and the Recount Chair shall determine how many members should be\n                 present. The persons specifically permitted by law to be present at the recount are\n                 entitled to be present as the cast vote records (ballot images) are printed and to have\n                 the same number of representatives as allowed for the recount.\nc.         If the manual recount does not take place immediately after the printing of the cast vote\n                 records (ballot images), the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be locked\n                 and secured until the recount takes place.\nd.        A manual count of the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be conducted in the\n                 same manner as a recount of hand-counted paper ballots.\nAfter the recount is complete, the printed cast vote records (ballot images) shall be secured and\npreserved for the appropriate preservation period for maintaining election records.\n\n\nPressley v.

Contestant requested to conditionally proceed with the Recount and re-print the available\n\nCVR data tiles.\n\n59.    Pursuant to TEX. ELEC.

CODE § 213.013(h), each\n\nperson entitled to be present at a recount is entitled to observe recount activities. Contestant was\n\nnot allowed to view the full recount process and how the recount data was selected from the\n\nelectronic voting machines. The CVR data files were identified, isolated and pre-selected prior to\n\nthe beginning of the Recount. Contestant requested to view the source and properties of the CVR\n\nfiles, such as dates of the CVR files and origination, and was denied by the Recount Committee\n\nMember, the Travis County Director of Elections, Michael Winn.\n\n                       Recount Precinct Returns-mega] Votes Counted\n\n60.    Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE § 214.002, counting procedures for a recount shall be\n\ncertified in the same manner as the original count. Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE § 65.014(b)(l),\n\nthe procedures for preparing the original precinct returns must state the total number of voters who\n\nvoted at the polling location as indicated by the poll list. Poll lists were not apparently reviewed\n\nby the Recount Committee during the recount. Dr. Pressley requested the poll lists to be reviewed\n\nand the number voters per precinct be reconciled with those documented on the polling location\n\ncombination sign-in forms.    Pressley requested those numbers be reconciled with the recount\n\nresults, because of Early Voting voter lists discrepancies identified in the Recount Petition. The\n\nrequest was denied by the Travis County Clerk, the Chair of the Recount Committee, and the\n\nDirector of Travis County Elections. The request was also specifically made prior to the recount\n\nin the Amended Petition for Recount (See Attached Appendix 11, Amended Petition for Recount.)\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.23\n                                                                                                       1560\n\f61.      Pursuant to TEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.012, the committee chair prepared a report of the vote\n\ncount. The Travis County Clerk and the Director of the Elections Division repeatedly informed\n\nDr. Pressley that \"it was not the scope of the Recount\" to reconcile the ballots with the number of\n\nvoters. The chair wrote, \"The numbers of voters matched the number of ballots cast,\" and signed\n\nthe report (See Attached Appendix 14, \"Recount Affidavit of Jay Brim\"). During the Recount, the\n\nnumbers of voters on voter lists were not publicly reconciled with the ballots recounted by the\n\nchair.   Dr. Pressley commented to the chair, \"Matching the numbers was not supposedly done\n\ntoday,\" and no explanation was provided by the chair.\n\n62.      On January 5, 2015, the Mayor of Austin and City Clerk approved Contestant's amended\n\npetition requesting a manual recount of actual stored \"images of ballots cast.,,19 Contestant's amended\n\npetition included a request to reconcile the ballots cast with the number of voters documented on the sign\n\nin sheets and combination fomls for District 4 for the countywide polling locations and Precincts to\n\nensure accurate reporting of results. The number of voters recorded and the number of votes recorded\n\ndid not match.\n\n         Ballot by Mail Ballots Are The Only Legal Ballots That Are Properly Preserved\n\n63.       This is why printing the \"images of the ballots cast\" is critical. The ballot in the General\n\nElection was very different (8 candidates) from the ballot in the Run Off (2 candidates). If some\n\nmemory cards or counting software were reused by mistake, then the \"images of the ballots cast\" will\n\ninstantly and unmistakably distinguish the tme votes from the illegal votes. This is the intent of the\n\n19 Texas Election Code §213.016.\nSec. 213.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING\nELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES. During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct\nrecording electronic voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\nrequired to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many committee members\nmust be present during the printing of the images. Each candidate is entitled to be present and to\nhave representatives present in the same number as prescribed by Section 213.0 13(b) for a recount\nduring the printing of the images.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.24\n                                                                                                             1561\n\f\"images of ballots cast\" language of the law. Which ballots were counted is the question that can be\n\nanswered only by review of the \"images of ballots cast.\"\n\n64.       The mandatory nature of this requirement becomes clear in context.\n\n          [W]e believe that violations of certain recording provisions by election clerks can\n          certainly undermine the purpose of the election code and obscure the true will of the\n          qualified voters.\n\nGonzalez v. Villareal, 251 S.W.3d at 778\n\n65.       Failure to retain \"image of ballots cast,\" \"ballots\" and or \"ballot originals\" is precisely such\n\na violation, because there is no clear and unequivocal record of the voter's intent, absent such an\n\nImage.\n\n66.          Given the facts and the election mistakes made by Travis County election officers, all of the\n\n4,023 votes that show to be cast in person, are in question and must be verified. Therefore, we ask the\n\nCourt to compel Travis County to print and tally the \"images of ballots cast\" for the District 4 Run Off\n\nso the court may ascertain whether the outcome as shown by the canvass is not the true outcome\n\nbecause illegal votes were counted. The list of the 4,023 voters and their Voter ID' s are provided in\n\nAppendix 15.\n\n67.       The recount included the Ballot by Mail ballots, and those specific results for Pressley and\n\nCasar were determined?O Ballot by Mail Votes were cast in seventeen of the eighteen precincts of\n\nDistrict 4. 21 Pressley received 240 votes and Casar received 240 votes of the 480 total votes cast\n\nfor either candidate for the Ballot by Mail ballots. Pressley received exactly 50% of the votes.\n\n68.       The Ballot by Mail result is very different from the 33.3 and 33.8% Pressley is reported to\n\nha ve received for early voting and election day voting from the \"cast vote records\" - a variation\n\nfrom mail-in votes and non-mail-in votes of almost 20% (See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount\n\n20   See attached Appendix 3, \"Recount Results.\"\n21   One precinct, with a population of a single voter, showed no votes.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                                 p.25\n                                                                                                             1562\n\fResults\").\n\n69.    The only actual \"ballots\" that were preserved and counted during the recount show\n\nPressley and Casar split the vote exactly in half. Moreover, 10 of the 18 precincts showed 50% or\n\nmore of the vote for Pressley. The Ballot by Mail ballots that were cast for either candidate (total\n\nof 480 votes) were over 10% of the total ballots cast for the Run Off election.\n\n70.          The 480 Ballot by Mail ballots are the only\" ballots,\" as that term is defined in the\n\nElection Code, which were available and counted during the recount.            Therefore, the election\n\nshould have been re-canvassed only with the 480 Ballot by Mail \"ballots\" and not the results\n\nincluding the 4,023 illegally recounted \"cast vote records.\"\n\n71.    This is an additional reason for the court to compel the Travis County Clerk to comply with\n\nTEX. ELEC. CODE § 213.016 22 and 214.049 (e?3 to print and count the statutorily required \"images\n\nof ballots cast\" and ascertain whether the previous outcome of the election is not the true outcome.\n\n72.    On January 6, 2015, the recount was conducted and completed. After the recount, the\n\ntotals were unchanged as compared to the original canvassed results.           The totals were Laura\n\nPressley 1,563, Gregorio \"Greg\" Casar 2,854 for a total of 4,417 votes cast.\n\n73.    Reconciliation ofvoier signatures on rolls at polling locations and total ballots cast has not\n\nbeen completed. An election contest is the only available remedy to explore the discrepancy\n\nbetween the number of ballots counted and the number of voter names and signatures in the\n\nprecincts.\n\n74.    The sum total of all voting irregularities identified herein exceeds the number of votes by\n\n\n\n22 \"PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT RECORDING ELECTRONIC\nVOTING MACHINES\"\n23\"If electronic voting system ballots are to be recounted manually, the original ballot, rather than\nthe duplicate of the original ballot, shall be counted.\"\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.26\n                                                                                                         1563\n\fwhich the election was decided.\n\n75.     If no \"images of ballots cast\" can be retrieved, printed and counted, Travis County cannot\n\nunequivocally determine the outcome of the election. The Court may order each of the more than\n\n4,000 voters who voted in person to testify as to how they voted, pursuant to Texas Election Code\n\nSec. 221.010. \"SECONDARY            EVIDENCE        FOR UNAVAILABLE              BALLOTS.      If an\n\nexamination of ballots is needed in an election contest and the ballots are lost, destroyed, or\n\notherwise beyond the reach of the tribunal, the voters who cast the ballots may testify as to how\n\nthey voted.\"\n\n76.     In the alternative, if Travis County cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\" to be printed\n\nand counted, then Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election, and\n\nthe election is void. As a matter oflaw, the Court must therefore order a new election. TEX. ELEC.\n\nCODE § 232.041. 24\n\n                                 VII. PETITION TIMELY FILED\n\n77.

VIOLATIONS OF LAW\n\n Texas Election Code Violation\n\n Lack of Notice of Relocation of Polling Place\n\n 82.    The facts asserted above are included herein by reference. Contestant claims that voters\n\n were disenfranchised due to the failure of Travis County to provide and/or maintain an adequate\n\n notice at the general election polling place (Highland Mall and other voting locations identified\n\n herein) detailing the relocation of the polling place to the Travis County offices for the runoff\n\n election in December 2014. Such failure to provide notice of relocation of the polling place for\n\n the runoff election is a violation of Texas Election Code § 43.062. Section 43.062 states:\n\n       Sec. 43.062. NOTICE AT PREVIOUS POLLING PLACE. Ifthe location of the\n       polling place for an election precinct is different from the location used for the\n       precinct in the preceding election ordered by the same authority, the authority\n       responsible for giving notice of the election shall, if possible, post notice at the\n       entrance to the previous polling place stating that the location has changed and\n       providing the location of the new polling place.\n\n       Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 802, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1,2001.\n\n Contestant seeks an order requiring a vacation of the runoff election and an order requiring a\n\n properly noticed runoff election be held forthwith.\n\n\n\nFailure to Provide \"Images of Ballots Cast\"\n\n83.     Contestant asserts that the December 2014 runoff fails to comply with the statutory\n\nrequirements of the Texas Election Code Chapters 128 and 213. Section 128.001 states:\n\n       Sec. 128.001. COMPUTERIZED VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                            p.28\n                                                                                                     1565\n\f       (a) The secretary of state shall prescribe procedures to allow for the use of a\n       computerized voting system. The procedures must provide for the use of a\n       computerized voting system with:\n             (1) multiple voting terminals for the input of vote selections on the ballot\n             presented by a main computer; and\n             (2) a main computer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote selection,\n             ballot image storage, and result tabulation.\n\n\n84.    Section 213.016 states:\n\n       Sec. 213.016. PRINTING IMAGES OF BALLOTS CAST USING DIRECT\n       RECORDING ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES.\n\n       During any printing of images of ballots cast using direct recording electronic\n       voting machines for the purpose of a recount, the full recount committee is not\n       required to be present. The recount committee chair shall determine how many\n       committee members must be present during the printing of the images. Each\n       candidate is entitled to be present and to have representatives present during the\n       printing of the images in the same number as Section 213.013(b) prescribes for\n       watchers for a recount.\n\n       Added by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 583, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1,2003.\n       Amended by:\n               Acts 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., Ch. 1235 (S.B. 1970), Sec. 22, eff. September\n       1,2009.\n\n\n 85.    As asserted above, the Travis County Clerk cannot provide \"images of ballots cast\" for\n\n purposes of a recount in the December runoff election as required by the Texas Election Code.\n\n Because the Travis County Clerk cannot produce \"images of ballots cast\", the ballots cast on the\n\n electronic voting machines cannot be verified. Contestant seeks an order from this case vacating\n\n the December 2014 runoff election. Since the only verifiable votes in the December runoff are\n\n the ballots by mail, said votes resulting in a tie in the runoff, Contestant seeks an order from this\n\n Court directing that another nmoff election be conducted and that the Travis County Clerk\n\n provide \"images of ballots cast\" in such a runoff election for purposes of allowing all affected\n\n parties to verify the results of said runoff in compliance with the above-referenced provisions of\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                              p.29\n                                                                                                         1566\n\f the Texas Election Code.\n\n\n\n Violation ofSection 2 of the Federal Voting Rights Act\n\n 86.    Contestant asserts that failure to provide notice at the general election polling place of the\n\n relocation of the polling place for the runoff has a disproportionate impact on minority voters in\n\n violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 42 U.S.c. §§ 1973b(f), 1973l(c)(3» (now 52\n\n USC 10303) bars voting discrimination against certain language minorities--specifically, persons\n\n of American Indian, Asian American, Native Alaskan, and Spanish heritage. Members of the\n\n protected class of Spanish heritage in Precincts 142 and 156 (Appendix 1) were disenfranchised\n\n by the confusion created by the lack of notice of the change in polling place for the December\n\n 2014 runoff election. Contestant seeks an injunction from this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.c.\n\n § 1983 vacating the runoff election and requiring a new runoff election forthwith.\n\n\n\n           IX. MOTION TO MODIFY STANDARD DISCOVERY PROCEDURES\n\n87.     Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 191.1, Contestants request that the Court sign\n\nan order shortening the time allowed for Contestee to comply with the discovery requests set forth\n\nbelow to no more than fifteen days.\n\n88.     Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 191.1, Contestants request that the Court sign\n\nan order shortening the time allowed for Contestee and third-party witnesses, voters, the City of\n\nAustin and Travis County, to comply with the discovery requests set forth below in paragraph to\n\nno more than ten days, and that the period of notice required for Deposition on Written Questions\n\nbe reduced to ten days.\n\n89.

RESPONSE TO SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS\n\n                                           Introduction\n\n91.    Dr. Pressley has found indisputable election irregularities and mistakes that were made in\n\nconducting the District 4 election held on December 16, 2014 that show the outcome as shown by\n\nthe final canvass is not accurate and she is bringing this election contest. Because illegal votes were\n\ncounted, eligible voters were prevented from voting, legal votes were not counted, and Travis\n\nCounty election officers made errors and mistakes, Dr. Pressley is asking, pursuant to Section\n\n221.003 (a), for the \"court to ascertain whether the outcome of the District 4 Run Off election, as\n\nshown by the canvass, is not the true outcome.\"      If a contestant is prevented by the county clerk\n\nfrom proving the actual number of legal votes by the clerk's act of not preserving or requiring or\n\ncounting images of the ballots actually cast there is no way to conclude the clerk reported the true\n\noutcome . Without the images of the actual ballots there is not a true outcome and the run-off\n\nelection must be repeated preserving the images of the ballots cast as provided and required by state\n\nlaw.\n\n92.    Contestee alleges Dr. Pressley is attacking the entire state-wide electronic-voting system. In\n\nfact, the contest is limited solely to the discrete errors made by the Travis County Clerk's office in\n\nthis single election. All counties are capable of complying with the law and preserving images of\n\nthe actual ballots cast by a voter. Travis county just elected to ignore that law and the sound public\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.3l\n                                                                                                          1568\n\fpolicy behind it. It cannot certify a true outcome by reason of its own misconduct in this election\n\nthat is at issue in this case.\n\n93.       Weaknesses in the Travis County Election systems are well known and have been\n\nextensively identified. Several years ago, Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir herself convened\n\na Travis County Clerk Election Study Group to evaluate Travis County's current voting system\n\nand             make             recommendation s            for           future             systems.\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontent/images/presentations_ articles/pdCtc _elections _E\n\nSG_Report_2009. pdf)        Clerk DeBeauvoir had determined that a study group was needed to\n\naddress public concerns about electronic voting and to ensure ample time to plan for an upgrade or\n\nreplacement of the existing system and \"its most significant recommendation is that Travis County\n\nmove away from an all-electronic voting system to one that offers electronically-counted paper\n\nballots.\" Clerk DeBeauvoir is on record stating the need to redesign and replace Travis County's\n\nvoting                                                                                        systems:\n\n(http://www. traviscountyclerk.org/eclerklcontent/images/presentations articles/pdf tc elections 2\n\n013.07.26 star.pdf and https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files12013/09/Dana-Debeauvoir-STAR-\n\nVoting-System-Diagram.pdf and \"Three years ago, DeBeauvoir decided that something had to\n\nchange. \"1 said, 'Okay, I'm fed up. I'm going to design my own system.'\" Part of her frustration\n\nstemmed from complaints lodged against the county that she felt blamed officials for things\n\nbeyond      their   control.\"(   https://www.texastribune.org120 14/07/09/travis-county-forges-new-\n\nterritory-voting-machines/):\n\n94.       Given the specific voting irregularities outlined herein, Dr. Laura Pressley fully supports\n\nthe Clerk's search for a more accountable and election system.      One critical component that the\n\nTravis County system is lacking is that Texas Election Code allows for a manual recount using\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.32\n                                                                                                         1569\n\f\"images of ballots cast.\" When Pressley requested a manual recount using \"images of ballots cast\"\n\nfor the District 4 Run Off election, Travis County is on record stating they cannot comply.\n\nInterestingly, in January 20] 5, Pressley was informed both by DeBeauvoir and fonner Travis\n\nCounty Judge Bill Aleshire that no other candidate in Travis County's history had requested a\n\nmanual recount of \"images of ballots cast.\" A review of reported cases shows no indication that\n\nany candidate in the state has requested such a statutorily-allowed recount. This contest, therefore,\n\nto the extent it decides issues regarding this mandate and this language, is a case of first\n.       .     25\nImpressIOn.\n\n\n\n The court will, of course, be guided by the Texas Supreme Court's view of statutory language,\n25\nwhich is not as fluid as that of federal courts or other state courts.\n\n       If the statutory text is unambiguous, a court must adopt the interpretation supported\n       by the statute's plain language unless that interpretation would lead to absurd results.\n       See Tune v.

If the text is unambiguous, we must\n       take the Legislature at its word and not rummage around in legislative minutiae.\"\n\n\nPressley v. Casar Fifth Amended OP Contest                                             p.33\n                                                                                                         1570\n\f95.      With regard to the fact that Travis Count's use of one version of the Hart InterCivic\n\neSlate system may violate the Texas Election Code requirements for storing, retrieving, and\n\nprinting of \"images of ballots cast,\" we respectfully assert any regulatory redefinition equating\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" with \"cast vote records\" exceeds the statutory grant of authority?6 Given\n\nthat the term \"ballot\" is defined in the Texas Election Code and \"images of ballots cast\" is\n\nreferenced with regard to recounts and \"cast vote records\" are not, the Texas Election Code trumps\n\nthe Secretary of State's administrative definitions.\n\n96.      Addressing the various pieces of evidence that became available and the irregularities that\n\noccurred during the recount is important in the analysis and evaluation of this election contest.\n\nThe recount evidence is critically material to this case and the allegations are legally relevant to\n\nthis election contest. Moreover, it is in the recount failures that Travis County's failure to use\n\nequipment up to statutory standards becomes clear.\n\n97.          The legal question raised by an election contest is whether the outcome of the\n\ncontested District 4 election is not, or cannot be conclusively detennined to be, the true outcome.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Pressley has found that illegal votes were counted, Travis County Elections\n\nDivision prevented eligible voters from voting, failed to count legal votes, and engaged in other\n\nirregularities that materially affected the election results. Moreover, because of the failure of\n\nTravis County to maintain \"images of ballots cast\", the outcome cannot be detennined to be the\n\n         Faced with clear statutory language, \"the judge's inquiry is at an end.\" It may be a\n         widespread practice to mine the minutiae of legislative records to discern what\n         lawmakers had in mind, but as we have held, relying on these materials is verboten\n         where the statutory text is, as here, absolutely clear.\n26 We cannot construe the rule in a manner that is inconsistent with the statute.

Contestee Casar misinterprets Contestant Dr. Pressley's claims in this case. She does not\n\nassert a claim of violation of equal protection as it relates to electronic voting systems.

Thus, the Andrade case is irrelevant.\n\n100.     Contestee Dr. Pressley's election contest claims were not asserted in Andrade v.

Rather, Contestant Dr. Pressley asserts, illegal votes were\n\ncounted, election officers prevented eligible voters from voting, election officers failed to count legal\n\nvotes, and election officers made mistakes that resulted in an election outcome which is not the true\n\noutcome and they did not preserve the images of ballots which is a possible function of the eSlate\n\nprogram.\n\n103.       Additionally, as a matter of law, Dr. Pressley claims that \"cast vote records\" do not meet the\n\nstatutory requirements of \"ballots,\" \"original ballots\" and/or \"images of ballots cast.\" Therefore, if\n\n\"images of ballots cast\" were not preserved, and thus cannot be retrieved, printed and counted,\n\nthen Travis County cannot unequivocally determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\n\n\nPressley v.

BACKGROUND\n\n1. Contestant requests this honorable Court to compel the Clerk of Travis County, Texas to\n\nprovide documents responsive to her Second Request for Production of Documents to Travis\n\nCounty Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir submitted on May 14, 2015.          Also, Contestant request this\n\nhonorable Court to compel the Clerk of Travis County, Texas to respond appropriately to\n\ndeposition requests that have been made by Contestant. The Clerk has recently filed a Motion for\n\nProtective Order claiming Contestant is conducting discovery which is outside the Court's Order\n\non Third Party Discovery Plan. This is not an accurate representation. The Travis County Clerk\n\nhas made erroneous objections, or asserted privileges which do not comply with Texas Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 193. Contestant's Second Request for Production ofDocuments submitted to the\n\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.l\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   4 0\n\fTravis County Clerk is relevant to the subject matter of her pending action and are directly\n\nrelated to new information disclosed in the Clerk's discovery response and Contestant would be\n\nunfairly prejudiced without such additional discovery.\n\n                             II.    ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n2. The Travis County Clerk continues to make overly broad statements and objections to\n\nContestant's production requests. The Clerk has not provided a good faith factual and legal basis\n\nfor the objections. Instead the Clerk's objections are broad, non-specific, and do not identify\n\nwhich of the 29 individual requests are problematic and why.\n\n3. According to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 192.3, it is not a ground for objection that the\n\ninformation sought will be inadmissible at trial if the information appears to be reasonably\n\ncalculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence. All of Contestant's requests will be\n\nadmissible and/or is expected to lead to admissible information.\n\n4. Contrary to the Clerk's assertion, Contestant is not seeking discovery that is contrary to the\n\nCourt's rulings. Contestant's Second Request for Production of Documents, submitted to the\n\nTravis County Clerk, is relevant to the subject matter of her pending action and are directly\n\nrelated to new information disclosed in the Clerk's discovery response and deposition.\n\nFurthermore, Contestant would be unfairly prejudiced without such additional discovery.\n\n5. If the Clerk believes a request violates the Court's ruling, the Clerk should be specific as to\n\nwhich requests from Contestant's Second Request for Production of Documents are in violation\n\nof the Third Party Discovery Control Plan.        At this time, the Clerk has only make broad\n\ngeneralities and no specific details of her allegations have been presented.\n\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4 07\n\f6. If the Court desires, Contestant is more than amendable to providing details for the various\n\nproduction request to explain the importance of each item and describe how the requests will\n\neither be admissible evidence at trial or lead to admissible evidence. However, this has been\n\nmade clear in the response to summary judgment and the motion to compel already on file.\n\n7. In addition, in light of the recent discovery responses and the Clerk's deposition, new\n\npleadings have been filed in Contestant's 6th Amended Petition 1 . Contestant's Second Request\n\nfor Production of Documents 2 reflect, and are directly related to, new information disclosed in\n\nClerk's recent discovery response and Contestant would be unfairly prejudiced without such\n\nadditional discovery.\n\n8. In fact, this Court stated to Contestant's Council, Mr. Rogers, \"If you can provide the Court\n\nwith some evidence as to some -- one of these mistakes that you can identify, I'll have them\n\nsearch for those particular issues .... \"(Transcript from Special Hearing, April 6, 2015, pp. 124-\n\n5). See below for examples of such mistakes that warrant further discovery requests.\n\n9. The Clerk's discovery responses and her subsequent deposition have validated that numerous\n\nmistakes were made during the tabulation of votes on the night of the Runoff election. 3 ' 4 Many\n\nvote corruption mistakes (Exhibit C, pages 5, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29 and 42), as evidenced in the Hart\n\nVoting System security audit logs errors, \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB [Mobile Ballot Box-where\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Exhibit A, Contestant's 61h Amended Petition.\n2\n  Exhibit B, 2nd Request for Production for Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir\n3\n  Exhibit C, Tally system security audit logs\n4\n  Exhibit D, Deposition of Travis County Clerk, Dana DeBeauvoir\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.3\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     4 08\n\fvotes are stored].\" Regarding these errors, the Clerk said, , \"I've never heard of so many.\" 5\n\n(Exhibit D, Page 98 lines 16-25)\n\n10. Contestant has made additional production requests based on the reasonable calculation that\n\nthe new information related to corrupt memory cards, corrupt hardware, preventive maintenance\n\nof hardware, corrective action logs, those with access to corrupt memory cards, manuals,\n\nspecifications, backup hardware, software, parallel testing, etc. will be admissible at trial or will\n\nlead to admissible information at trial so the Court can determine if the true outcome of the\n\nelection can be known\n\n11. In addition, discovery documents specifically state ballot images in the form of an image file\n\n(.bmp) and cast vote records are stored on the Hart Voting System6 (Exhibit E, page 24 and 259-\n\n260) and thus Contestant has made specific requests related to ballot images stored on the\n\nequipment.\n\n12. The Clerk further misrepresents the facts in this case with respect to the manual recount.\n\nThe manual recount was conducted in violation of the Texas Election Code, in that ballot images\n\nwere not used to recount votes, A cast vote record is not an image ofballots cast because it is not\n\na ballot, or an image.\n\n13. Also, in the Motion for Protective Order, the Clerk misrepresents that documents have been\n\nprovided to Contestant that \"verify the outcome of the election\":\n\n\n\n\n5\n    Exhibit D, Dana Deposition, MBB references.\n6\n    Exhibit E, Hart Voting System Ballot Now Operations Manual\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        4 0\n\f           a. Polling place sign in sheets-These do not verify the votes cast by voters, do not\n\n              meet requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and\n\n              therefore, do not verity the election outcome.\n\n           b. Audit logs- These do not verity the votes cast by voters, do not meet\n\n              requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and therefore,\n\n              do not verity the election outcome. In addition, the audit logs have been found to\n\n              have missing entries and thus are not credible.\n\n           c. Serial numbers of equipment- These do not verify the votes cast by voters, do\n\n              not meet requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and\n\n              therefore, do not verity the election outcome.\n\n           d. List of Early Votes names- These do not verity the votes cast by voters, do not\n\n              meet requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and\n\n              therefore, do not verify the election outcome. In addition, compared to Early\n\n              Voting lists provided in December to Contestant, it appears many voters names\n\n              have been removed and thus is not a credible list.\n\n           e. Canvass Reports- These do not verify the votes cast by voters, do not meet\n\n              requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and therefore,\n\n              do not verify the election outcome..     These lists are produced from the same\n\n              system that was subject to the \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB\" errors and thus are\n\n              unreliable.\n\n\n\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.5\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   4 10\n\f               f.   Zero Tapes-These do not verity the votes cast by voters, do not meet\n\n                    requirements in the Texas Election Code as statutory ballot images, and therefore,\n\n                    do not verify the election outcome. In addition, discovery documents provided by\n\n                    Travis County show no \"Zero Tapes\" that meet the Texas Secretary of State's\n\n                    definition were printed and retained for the Runoff and thus were not provided to\n\n                    Contestant.\n\n\n\n14. To be clear, documents have not been provided to Contestant that meet Texas Election Code\n\nto verity the voters' intent in the District 4 Runoff election and thus do not verify the outcome of\n\nthe election.\n\n15. Furthermore, the Clerk misrepresents the intent of the Court's Discovery Control Plan Order7\n\nparagraph 8 whose subject matter specifically refers to communication documents and\n\nContestant's Second Request for Production do not ask for any communication related\n\ndocuments:\n\n               a. \" ... emails, memos, correspondence, or text messages regarding communications\n\n                    regarding the election without specificity as to the email and basis ... \"\n\n               b.    \" ... communications (including reports, emails, memo, correspondence, text\n\n                    messages, IM's, video conferencing or power points) regarding the election ... \"\n\n\n\n\n7\n    Exhibit F, Court's Discovery Plan Order\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         4 11\n\f16. It is unreasonable for the Clerk to claim immunity from further discovery requests since the\n\nelection records of the Runoff are statutorily held by the Travis County Clerk's office.\n\nAdditional discovery requests are needed to ascertain if the true outcome can be determined.\n\n17. Also, for the Clerk to continue to make statements that Contestant's case is a \"frivolous\n\ncontest\" is highly disingenuous and inappropriate given the numerous election irregularities and\n\npossible criminal violations that have caused statutorily required election records to be missing\n\nand/or deleted. Because of the missing election records, the true outcome of the Runoff cannot\n\nbe known and Contestant will continue to make requests for documents and depositions that will\n\nbe admissible in trial or lead to admissible information for trial.\n\n18. It is not been proven by the Travis County's Clerk's office that the Hart Voting System does\n\nnot have the capability to produce \"images of ballots cast\" per the Texas Election Code. Based\n\non Hart Manuals, and Hart patents, the equipment has the capability to store and use ballot\n\nimage files in the form of a bitmap (.bmp ). Contestant asserts that Travis County may not\n\nunderstand how their equipment stores or retrieves ballot images:\n\n               a. Firstly, the Ballot Now manual 8 provided to Contestant clearly documents the\n\n                   system saves \"ballot images\" in the form of a bitmap (.bmp format) file and in\n\n                   addition, it stores cast vote records (data structure format) to transfer data to Tally\n\n                   system. In the Clerk's deposition, she stated, the Ballot Now does not store ballot\n\n                   images. This is clearly a misinformed statement.\n\n\n\n\n8\n    Exhibit E, Hart's Ballot Now Operations Manual (page 24 and 259-260)\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.7\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             4 12\n\f               b. Secondly, in Contestant's First Request for Production, all Cast Vote Records\n\n                   were requested and we know they have not been produced. It has been repeatedly\n\n                   stated by the Clerk's counsel, Mr. Williams, that they have produced all cast vote\n\n                   records. This is clearly a misinformed statement given the Ballot Now manual9\n\n                   clearly states Cast Vote Records are stored and used to transfer Absentee/Mail in\n\n                   Ballot voter data, and\n\n               c. Thirdly, in Contestant's First Request for Production, all Ballot Images were\n\n                   requested and we know they have not been produced. It has been repeatedly\n\n                   stated by the Clerk's counsel, Mr. Williams, that they cannot produce any ballot\n\n                   1mages.     This is a misinformed statement given Travis County's Ballot Now\n\n                   Operations manual clearly states ballot images in the form of a bitmap file (.bmp)\n\n                   are stored and can be retrieved. 10\n\nThus, given these three examples of Travis County not being aware of the full capabilities of the\n\nHart system as they relate to cast vote records and ballot images, Contestant seeks information to\n\nprove or disprove ballot images remain on the eSlate, JBC, and the Mobile Ballot Boxes\n\n(MBB' s) for the Runoff.\n\n19. Contestant understands and is sensitive to proprietary concerns given she holds four U.S.\n\npatents herself and because of her extensive background in the technology industry here in\n\nAustin. With that in mind, Contestant is amenable to gaining access to documents under a\n\n\n\n9\n     Exhibit E, Hart's Ballot Now Operations Manual (page 24 and 259-260)\n10\n     Exhibit E, Hart's Ballot Now Operations Manual (page 24 and 259-260)\n\nPressley v. Casar, Contestant's Response to Third Party Protective Order\n                                           p.8\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        4 13\n\fprotective order or in camera inspection. The intent of the discovery requests are to determine if\n\nthe true outcome of the election can be known.\n\n20. Oral deposition of those Travis County employees and/or contractors that have information\n\nregarding security database error codes or security protocols that occurred during the Runoff\n\ngiven the security breaches, missing audit log entries, corrupt error codes, duplicate vote entries,\n\nthat occurred with the tabulation of votes is critical and is reasonably calculated to lead to\n\nadmissible information.       In addition, in her deposition, the Travis County Clerk agreed to\n\nprovide names of such individuals. 11\n\n21.

Rogers Misstates the Standard for Chapter 10 Sanctions\n\n       Contestee Casar seeks relief under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode. He does not seek sanctions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13, and Rogers'\n\nResponse confuses the two standards. Contestee's burden is not, as Rogers asserts, to prove that\n\nthe Contestant's pleadings were \"groundless,\" or brought for an \"improper purpose.\" See Reply\n\nat   5-7. This is the standard under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13. A different test applies\n\nunder Chapter 10 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code, the authority under which Contestee\n\nseeks sanctions.\n\n       Under § 10.001, the signer of a pleading or motion certifies that \"each claim, each\n\nallegation, and each denial is based on the signatory's best knowledge, information, and\n\nbelief, formed after reasonable inquiry.\" Low v.

Rogers Failed to Make a Reasonable Inquiry into the Claims and Legal\n               Contentions Asserted under 10.001(2)\n\n\n       Rogers repeatedly, throughout six separate Contests, made the legal contention that a\n\n\"ballot image\" differs from a \"cast vote record.\" See Original Contest at    32-38; Second\n\nAmended Contest at      31-37; Third Amended Contest at       43-53; Fourth Amended Contest at\n\n   43-53; Fifth Amended Contest at      49-59; Sixth Amended Contest at       3, 13,82,84,97-\n\n138. In his reply, he attempts to justify these contentions by claiming that he reasonably relied on\n\nseveral sources. See Rogers' Response at       As an initial matter, Rogers did not cite most these\n\nsupposed legal sources until the Sixth Amended Contest and therefore could not have relied on\n\nthem for the first five Contests he filed. Furthermore, a close examination of these sources\n\nreveals that Rogers failed to make a reasonably inquiry into his claim that a Ballot Image differs\n\nfrom a Cast Vote Record.\n\n       Simply put, Rogers' inquiry was not reasonable.

We are here with various motions.        We have\n\n 5   summary judgment motions.     We have motions for sanctions.\n\n 6   We have motions to strike pleadings.         We have motions to,\n\n 7   basically, enforce a Rule 11 agreement regrading\n\n 8   discovery costs unless that was resolved by Travis County\n\n 9   and Ms. Pressley's side of the lawsuit.\n\n10                  Anything that I missed?        Mr. Herring is\n\n11   here on behalf of Mr. Casar and Mr. Cohen is here on\n\n12   behalf Dr. Pressley.\n\n13                  MR. HERRING:     Thank you.     You have\n\n14   everything we have.\n\n15                  MR. COHEN:     There's a Motion to Compel\n\n16   Discovery.\n\n17                  THE COURT:     Right.   I have -- I have --\n\n18                  MR. COHEN:     Okay.    You didn't mention it.\n\n19   So I just want to make sure.     They have a protective\n\n20   order with respect to their motion, the County does.           So\n\n21   that's all joined on what you're going to do.         Both\n\n22   parties have briefed it pretty well.         You're just going\n\n23   to have to make a decision.\n\n24                  THE COURT:     Are you ready to proceed on the\n\n25   County's motion?\n                           LAURA H.

COHEN:    Summary judgment?\n\n 2                  THE COURT:    For the payment of the money.\n\n 3                  MS. THOMAS:    Judge, counsel did forward a\n\n 4   check on Friday.   We just need them to make sure it's\n\n 5   written to the right person.     Also, we would like the\n\n 6   Court to entertain the attorneys fees, because it did\n\n 7   require filing of a motion before they were willing to\n\n 8   pay.\n\n 9                  THE COURT:    You asked for, like, $250\n\n10   attorneys fees, something like that?\n\n11                  MS. THOMAS:    I believe that is correct,\n\n12   Your Honor.\n\n13                  MR. COHEN:    Your Honor, we have a dispute\n\n14   about whether they were charging too much.       Rather than\n\n15   bring that to you, we eventually decided, well, it's a\n\n16   $500 difference, but it was a legitimate dispute.       They\n\n17   didn't give us any backup to the invoice.     They just sent\n\n18   an invoice.   The people that were there -- I can't speak\n\n19   to that.   I wasn't at the actual production session, but\n\n20   I'm told they were making copies with their own people\n\n21   and their own copies and charging us; just rinky dink\n\n22   stuff as far as I'm concerned.\n\n23                  THE COURT:    When I read the motion,\n\n24   counsel, as you -- you've probably practiced a long time,\n\n25   as I have and Mr. Herring has.    You well know -- all of\n                         LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                            (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                  6\n 1   you well know, judges don't like to get involved in those\n\n 2   kind of things, especially when you start reading, Did\n\n 3   they take a lunch break?    And, you know, the Court tried\n\n 4   to accommodate your client's side by reducing the costs,\n\n 5   and the County did, too.    And then to see a discovery\n\n 6   dispute come up about payment of fees and copiers and,\n\n 7   you know, pointing fingers --\n\n 8                 MR. COHEN:    It was a legitimate dispute.\n\n 9   We decided -- I decided, frankly, that it was not worth\n\n10   -- we shouldn't waste the Court's time on that today; and\n\n11   that if there's a dispute, it's over $500.      There's a lot\n\n12   more money being spent in this case than $500.\n\n13                 THE COURT:    So you want $250 in attorneys\n\n14   fees?\n\n15                 MS. THOMAS:    Yes, Your Honor.\n\n16                 MR. COHEN:    I just don't think there's any\n\n17   reason to warrant attorneys fees.    There's no attorneys\n\n18   fees -- there's no provision in the law for you to award\n\n19   attorneys fees and there's no -- you know, as you well\n\n20   know, in order to award attorneys fees, there has to be\n\n21   some sanctionable conduct, and disputing and debating the\n\n22   amount of the bill is not something that you would\n\n23   normally award attorneys fees for.\n\n24                 MS. THOMAS:    Your Honor, there was a series\n\n25   of exchanges with counsel on whether or not it was\n                        LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                           (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                       7\n 1   appropriate to pay that amount.    As you know, we went\n\n 2   above and beyond by not only even accommodating their\n\n 3   request to bring in their own printer.      So the fight --\n\n 4   it required us to file a motion.    That's all that we're\n\n 5   asking for is the time spent to require them to pay,\n\n 6   which didn't have to happen.    And it's the same type of\n\n 7   discovery issues we're seeing over and over with\n\n 8   Ms. Pressley.    So we ask that to deter the behavior in\n\n 9   the future.\n\n10                   THE COURT:   Sherine Thomas.   I'm sorry.     I\n\n11   didn't call your name since you were a party.      Ms. Thomas\n\n12   with the County Attorney representing the County Clerk.\n\n13                   My inclination is to award the attorneys\n\n14   fees because the motion got filed and it wasn't resolved.\n\n15   So I don't think $250 is an extremely large amount of\n\n16   money for the filing of that pleading, and I had to spend\n\n17   the time reading it, too.\n\n18                   MR. COHEN:   I understand, Your Honor, and\n\n19   there was a dispute.    There was a legitimate dispute.       It\n\n20   wasn't some frivolous thing.    There was a legitimate\n\n21   dispute about what we were paying for.      They did not give\n\n22   us a detailed accounting for where they got to that\n\n23   number.    And so we had a little discussion internally and\n\n24   decided that it wasn't worth fighting about, and so we\n\n25   paid it.\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                      8\n 1                    So what I'm saying is, there was -- they\n\n 2   didn't provide us with a backup to show that their bill\n\n 3   was legitimate and for us to say, Well, now, we saw it\n\n 4   this way.    How did you see it?    And the response was to\n\n 5   file a motion.    So they elected to file a motion that\n\n 6   they really didn't have to file until we worked it out,\n\n 7   and I shouldn't -- my client shouldn't have to pay their\n\n 8   attorneys fees for doing that.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:    What do you say?\n\n10                    MS. THOMAS:    Your Honor, we did lay it out\n\n11   for them; and, in fact, they were present.        The question\n\n12   of lunch hours and things -- they were present during,\n\n13   and they know that our clients were working throughout\n\n14   the day.    So that doesn't seem like a fair thing.\n\n15                    THE COURT:    You say they were present?\n\n16   You're talking about Ms. Pressley?\n\n17                    MS. THOMAS:   And her counsel.\n\n18                    THE COURT:    And the lawyer, Mr. Rogers, was\n\n19   there?\n\n20                    MS. THOMAS:   Mr. Rogers was there.     In\n\n21   addition, Your Honor, when the check was delivered, it\n\n22   had a cover letter saying that they're giving us the\n\n23   check in the amount under protest.      And so that means\n\n24   that this is still live in their minds, because that's\n\n25   what they asserted to us.      And we ask the Court to\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                       9\n 1   resolve the issue today so we don't have to be back here.\n\n 2                   THE COURT:    Mr. Rogers just appeared.\n\n 3                   Mr. Rogers, you heard Ms. Thomas say you\n\n 4   were present during the discovery when this issue of who\n\n 5   was out for lunch and who was eating sandwiches and who\n\n 6   had slow copiers and all the other things that were an\n\n 7   allegation.    Do you read those pleadings to be accurate?\n\n 8                   MR. ROGERS:    No, Your Honor, I don't.     And\n\n 9   while I was there for the whole time, one of the things\n\n10   that I can tell the Court was that, for a great deal of\n\n11   the time, the employees of the County Clerk's office left\n\n12   the area where we had our copier set up and went and made\n\n13   copies for the County Clerk's records on their own time\n\n14   and left the copiers alone.      We did get somebody in there\n\n15   when somebody was leaving for a whole hour for lunch.\n\n16                   The clerk's office was kind enough to bring\n\n17   a substitute in there, but I would say somewhere between\n\n18   a third and a half of the time that we were there, the\n\n19   County Clerk's employees were making copies for the\n\n20   County Clerk's records.      Their copies -- they gave us\n\n21   originals.    We made copies and then they made copies of\n\n22   our copies for their records.      I don't think my client\n\n23   should be charged for their making copies for their\n\n24   records, and that was a considerable amount of the time\n\n25   that was involved, Your Honor.\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                    10\n 1                    THE COURT:    Well, it doesn't sound -- a\n\n 2   check has been tendered, Mr. Cohen said.         Sounds like\n\n 3   maybe we ought to have a hearing and decide what really\n\n 4   went on if there's a really legitimate contest.         And then\n\n 5   if I find bad behavior, then I'll sanction somebody for\n\n 6   it.   So you-all can decide what we're going to do.        I\n\n 7   think the attorney's fees should be paid or else we're\n\n 8   going to have a hearing to determine whether sanctions\n\n 9   should be imposed, and I'll hold that in abeyance and\n\n10   you-all can talk about it.\n\n11                    MR. COHEN:    Your Honor, we don't want to\n\n12   have a hearing.    We don't want to fight about the\n\n13   minutia.   The only reason this is relevant is to the\n\n14   issue of attorney's fees and whether our dispute was\n\n15   reasonable and legitimate so that we didn't do anything\n\n16   sanctionable by it with them before they filed a motion.\n\n17   They elected to file a motion while we were discussing\n\n18   these matters.\n\n19                    THE COURT:    It doesn't look like -- they\n\n20   thought or felt compelled to file a motion because\n\n21   apparently they couldn't -- they didn't have any sense\n\n22   that they were going to be resolved.         If what Mr. Rogers\n\n23   is telling the Court, he still has some argument about\n\n24   what actually occurred.       So I'm willing to give you a\n\n25   hearing, and you can bring witnesses and we can spend two\n                           LAURA H.

And if I find bad\n\n 2   behavior, somebody's going to get sanctioned.\n\n 3                   MR. COHEN:    The reason I got paid --\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    You want to pay the attorney's\n\n 5   fees?\n\n 6                   MR. COHEN:    -- was so we didn't have to\n\n 7   have a hearing.    If you order it, I've got to comply with\n\n 8   your order, Your Honor.      I'm just objecting to it.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:    I'm affording you the\n\n10   opportunity to have the hearing.      That's what I'm\n\n11   affording you to do.      Do you want to have the hearing or\n\n12   pay the attorney's fees?\n\n13                   MR. COHEN:    We're going to just pay the\n\n14   attorneys fees.\n\n15                   THE COURT:    So the attorneys fees will get\n\n16   paid.    It's resolved.    That's what we'll do with that.\n\n17                   MS. THOMAS:    Your Honor, I have a draft\n\n18   order.\n\n19                   THE COURT:    Have you seen a copy?     Show him\n\n20   a copy of it.\n\n21                   MS. THOMAS:    It says that the payment has\n\n22   already been received for the $836; that it was\n\n23   appropriate and that there's $250 in attorney's fees.\n\n24                   THE COURT:    This order acceptable to you,\n\n25   Mr. Cohen?\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                     12\n 1                   MR. COHEN:     It's not acceptable to me as\n\n 2   far as the substance, but the form seems to be okay.\n\n 3                   THE COURT:     All right.     Based upon your\n\n 4   agreement, then I'll enter that.       I'll enter that order\n\n 5   is what we'll do.\n\n 6                   All right.     Now, the -- we have -- we have\n\n 7   a Motion to Strike Pleadings which relates -- that's the\n\n 8   -- that's the motion to strike the sixth amended\n\n 9   petition, Mr. --\n\n10                   MR. HERRING:     Judge, the motion was\n\n11   actually filed when they had filed either the fourth or\n\n12   fifth --\n\n13                   THE COURT:     The fifth maybe.\n\n14                   MR. HERRING:     And we have filed, now, the\n\n15   amended motion, and we're not seeking to strike those\n\n16   pleadings.    So that's off the table.      Our amended motion\n\n17   takes that request off.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     We don't have that motion?\n\n19                   MR. HERRING:     No.\n\n20                   THE COURT:     So then probably the next\n\n21   easiest thing to do is deal with the summary judgment\n\n22   motion.    Would counsel agree?\n\n23                   MR. HERRING:     I think --\n\n24                   MR. COHEN:     That's fine, Your Honor.\n\n25                   THE COURT:     Since it's your summary\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                         13\n 1   judgment motion, did you -- did you read all the\n\n 2   pleadings that were filed this morning, Mr. Herring?\n\n 3   There were pleadings sent.      When I turned my phone on\n\n 4   this morning, I had two more things that popped up on my\n\n 5   phone.\n\n 6                   MR. HERRING:     Right.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:     When I got here to the\n\n 8   courthouse this morning, one of the clerks was kind\n\n 9   enough to have printed them.      And I read them.        I don't\n\n10   know whether you've read them.\n\n11                   MR. HERRING:     I have glanced at them, and\n\n12   someone here at the table with me has read them.           So I\n\n13   think we're ready to go.\n\n14                   THE COURT:     So you're ready to speak to\n\n15   that?\n\n16                   MR. HERRING:     At least one of those didn't\n\n17   relate to us.   It goes back to the County.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     Right.     It deals with\n\n19   compelling some production, basically.\n\n20                   MR. HERRING:     One of them addressed our\n\n21   Motion to Strike, which we're not seeking to strike.              All\n\n22   we have pending on that front is the request for\n\n23   attorney's fees which would come after the summary\n\n24   judgment motion depending on the Court's ruling.\n\n25                   THE COURT:     I have read all of your\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                  14\n 1   motions.   And I'll show you I've tagged them, as you can\n\n 2   see, with little points.     I read, you know -- I read all\n\n 3   the stuff again this morning.     So let me just say this.\n\n 4   This is my observation.     I'm not as smart as you are\n\n 5   about all these DREs and CVRs and mobile ballot boxes and\n\n 6   all that type of thing.     But it seems to the Court that\n\n 7   Dr. Pressley's lawsuit rises and falls or falls on the\n\n 8   issue of whether CVRs are ballot images; whether that\n\n 9   term CVR can be equated to a ballot image.\n\n10                  I read your expert's report that CVRs are,\n\n11   you know, some kind of data; that the other things are\n\n12   bits.   I've read all your little -- I'm not saying yours,\n\n13   but what you proposed to the Court about all these legal\n\n14   distinctions, computer terminology.     But what I want to\n\n15   ask Mr. Cohen that I don't know -- Mr. Rogers is here.        I\n\n16   don't know who is going to speak for Dr. Pressley.\n\n17                  MR. COHEN:    I will.\n\n18                  THE COURT:    Before we start, do you agree\n\n19   that that seems to be the crux of whether you win or lose\n\n20   this lawsuit, that particular issue?\n\n21                  MR. COHEN:    No, Your Honor.   That is one of\n\n22   the issues.   There's a statute that says that -- there's\n\n23   two statutes involved.     They have to be read to be\n\n24   consistent with each other.     221.012 says that if the\n\n25   tribunal cannot ascertain the outcome of the election,\n                         LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                            (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                  15\n 1   it's supposed to void the election.     And that two point\n\n 2   -- the other one is two point -- 221.003(a), which says\n\n 3   that a Court can void the election based on its findings\n\n 4   of certain things.   And one of them is mistakes.\n\n 5                   So we are contending that there are a lot\n\n 6   of mistakes, and we have fact allegations and fact\n\n 7   evidence, summary-judgment evidence that these mistakes\n\n 8   occurred and that those mistakes are sufficient to\n\n 9   prevent the Court from being able to ascertain the true\n\n10   outcome of the election.     One of those mistakes is the\n\n11   counting CVRs without maintaining images of ballots.\n\n12                   THE COURT:   But that's the bigger issue in\n\n13   terms of, if the Court determines that a CVR is the\n\n14   equivalent of a ballot image, you -- your client has had\n\n15   access to those, counted those, and those documents show\n\n16   what the tally came out where your client was, like, 1291\n\n17   votes behind.   I think it's 1291.\n\n18                   MR. COHEN:   That's correct.   If you\n\n19   determine that a CVR is equal -- is a ballot image, then\n\n20   that takes that off the plate.     If you determine that it\n\n21   isn't, then there's -- there's no way to count votes at\n\n22   all, okay, and you have to redo the election.     That's\n\n23   clear.   But assuming for a minute that you can look at\n\n24   this CVR --\n\n25                   THE COURT:   And I've looked --\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                16\n 1                   MR. COHEN:   That's a ballot.   Assuming you\n\n 2   can do that.    I can't do that, but assuming you can for a\n\n 3   minute --\n\n 4                   THE COURT:   It's more assuming that I think\n\n 5   the law allows that to be viewed that way not what I\n\n 6   particularly believe.     Does the law allow, based upon\n\n 7   what I've read and seen, looked at all your argument --\n\n 8                   MR. COHEN:   We'll talk about that as we go\n\n 9   through the hearing.    To answer your question, if you\n\n10   assume that the -- if you conclude that a CVR is the same\n\n11   as a ballot, either as a matter of law or as a matter of\n\n12   fact, then all that's left in our case is to point out\n\n13   all the mistakes that were made that bring into question\n\n14   whether the outcome is a true outcome or not.\n\n15                   THE COURT:   And those would be the nine\n\n16   errors with the mobile ballot boxes and the periods of\n\n17   time with the closing and opening of these so-called\n\n18   tally sheets.\n\n19                   MR. COHEN:   Yes.\n\n20                   THE COURT:   Is that a fair summation?\n\n21                   MR. COHEN:   There's a few others that I\n\n22   just can't remember off the top of my head.\n\n23                   THE COURT:   You didn't like the closing of\n\n24   certain polling places.\n\n25                   MR. COHEN:   Yeah, that -- I've kind of\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                    17\n 1   given up on that one.\n\n 2                    THE COURT:   I was going to ask you some\n\n 3   more about that, too, in terms of the fact that your\n\n 4   client had notice and didn't protest.        It seems -- you\n\n 5   pointed out there's nothing that says it's a waiver, but\n\n 6   when everybody gets notice that we're going to decide\n\n 7   where to go hold this runoff election -- and you and I\n\n 8   both know the runoffs all produce generally lower votes.\n\n 9   So there's reasons to reduce the number of polling\n\n10   places.     I'm not the one writing this, because somebody\n\n11   else can grade my paper, too, that goes up the road.\n\n12                    MR. COHEN:   I am assuming that we cannot\n\n13   establish that votes were lost because of that.        Okay.\n\n14   So the question -- what I'm getting at is, there's -- I\n\n15   have a list here right now, but not right in front of me.\n\n16                    THE COURT:   But it seems like there's\n\n17   three:     ballot images, CVR, mobile ballot boxes, and\n\n18   whatever errors that produced or didn't produce and those\n\n19   tally sheets being remaining open for periods of time --\n\n20   you know, for a couple of hours without activity, several\n\n21   days without activity.    Those seem to be the more\n\n22   problematic things with -- that's my reading of what you\n\n23   offered.\n\n24                    MR. COHEN:   Those are the most ones.\n\n25   You're right.    You pinpointed the ones that, in my view,\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                      18\n 1   show that the computer was subject to manipulation for\n\n 2   days at a time; that the clerk doesn't even -- has never\n\n 3   seen that many invalid MMBs (sic) and doesn't think that\n\n 4   the reader was working properly.       And so there are some\n\n 5   serious mistakes that were made during the course of\n\n 6   tallying the votes that bring into question whether or\n\n 7   not the computer actually properly tallied the voter's\n\n 8   selection on these ballots.\n\n 9                    THE COURT:   No.    I understand.   That calls\n\n10   into question the legitimacy of the outcome.\n\n11                    MR. COHEN:   Yes.\n\n12                    THE COURT:   The tallies and mobile ballot\n\n13   box errors -- I'm not saying the other does.         We got --\n\n14   we have a CVR that no one -- I mean, all I read from your\n\n15   expert -- he doesn't say that ballot image that -- where\n\n16   they finally go vote is not accurately transcribed into a\n\n17   different electronic format when it goes to a Cast Vote\n\n18   Record.   He just doesn't like the format.      He wants the\n\n19   format to be more expansive, have more bits of\n\n20   information.     And I understand the legal distinction that\n\n21   you're making.\n\n22                    MR. COHEN:   Yes.    There's other policy\n\n23   discussions.     We're getting out of step here.      Yeah.\n\n24                    THE COURT:   And I just wanted Mr. Herring\n\n25   to know that before he started with his -- since he's\n                           LAURA H.

COHEN:     He's jumping up because he\n\n 3   wants to do his motion for summary judgment.\n\n 4                 MR. HERRING:     I'm actually enjoying it.\n\n 5                 MR. COHEN:     So I will have a more detailed\n\n 6   response.\n\n 7                 THE COURT:     No.    That's fine.   We're close.\n\n 8                 MR. COHEN:     Two things:    One is, there's no\n\n 9   ballots without an image of the ballot.      That's the law.\n\n10   Now, the question is whether a CVR satisfies that or not\n\n11   is a different issue.    But without a ballot -- image of a\n\n12   ballot, there's no votes to count.\n\n13                 THE COURT:     Correct.    Only the absentee --\n\n14                 MR. COHEN:     Yes.\n\n15                 THE COURT:     There was a tie in the absentee\n\n16   ballots.\n\n17                 MR. COHEN:     Or the mail-in.\n\n18                 THE COURT:     Whatever it was.\n\n19                 MR. COHEN:     And the other issue is, there\n\n20   was enough mistakes to bring into question the validity\n\n21   of the tallied counts.   That's it.\n\n22                 THE COURT:     Mr. Cohen, thank you.\n\n23                 Go ahead, Mr. Herring.\n\n24                 MR. HERRING:     May it please the Court.\n\n25   Judge, I think you did a good job in helping save me time\n                        LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                           (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                   20\n 1   in terms of what I need to present by honing in on the\n\n 2   issues.   You've heard most of this before.        Let me\n\n 3   mention -- with the Court's indulgence, I'll have\n\n 4   Ms. Palvino speak after I do on the objection that we\n\n 5   filed to the summary-judgment evidence that they\n\n 6   presented.     Essentially, it focuses on the purported\n\n 7   expert who has zero expertise in election law, but I'll\n\n 8   save that.     She, also, is going to talk about these\n\n 9   supposed errors in the other system.         But I want to focus\n\n10   on the big issues.\n\n11                    Certainly, I want to start with the issue\n\n12   of CVR ballot image, because I think, as Mr. Rogers said\n\n13   during our first hearing -- he said, quote, the big\n\n14   central issue in this lawsuit is whether a CVR is a\n\n15   ballot image.    And he said in that first hearing, quote,\n\n16   if you rule that way, that would obviously put a big hole\n\n17   in our case.\n\n18                    And we think they have a massive hole in\n\n19   their case, Judge, as a result of that.        And let me -- I\n\n20   have a brief packet here from the summary-judgment\n\n21   evidence, if I may approach?\n\n22                    THE COURT:   Yes, sir.   I didn't -- I didn't\n\n23   print all your summary-judgment evidence.         It was just --\n\n24   there were too many pages.     I figured you would -- I'd\n\n25   read your footnotes and see whether it referenced a\n                           LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                              (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                    21\n 1   deposition or a document, but I did not go read all those\n\n 2   pieces of paper.\n\n 3                   MR. HERRING:     You need to, Judge.\n\n 4                   MR. COHEN:     It's my policy, Your Honor --\n\n 5                   MR. HERRING:     It's right here.\n\n 6                   MR. COHEN:     It's my policy that I just\n\n 7   don't go through all those things with the hearing on the\n\n 8   Motion for Summary Judgment.      I'm assuming that the Court\n\n 9   is very smart enough to read it all and understand it\n\n10   without me regurgitating it.      So it's going to be a short\n\n11   overview of what it says.\n\n12                   THE COURT:     What I was looking for was a\n\n13   basis of the allegation or representations that were\n\n14   made.   In other words, if you say there's some material\n\n15   fact that you want me to consider, then you reference\n\n16   that it's in a deposition or an exhibit list.       And if one\n\n17   side represents it wrong, I assume the other side is\n\n18   going to tell me, Well, Judge, they're not telling you\n\n19   the truth.    So I'm relying on the lawyers to do that\n\n20   rather than me reading it.      Like Mr. Herring has a stack\n\n21   of pages here about three feet high.\n\n22                   MR. COHEN:     We've got several boxes, also,\n\n23   Your Honor.\n\n24                   MR. HERRING:     Three and a half feet, but I\n\n25   left -- I left the Motion for Summary Judgment response\n                          LAURA H. TAYLOR, CSR\n                             (512) 854-9054\n\f                                                                        22\n 1   in the boxes because, otherwise, it would fall over.           I\n\n 2   think what their defense is, is obfuscation through\n\n 3   deforestation.\n\n 4                    I think if you look at the real issues, the\n\n 5   overwhelming majority of those documents are completely\n\n 6   irrelevant and immaterial.     So let me get back to the\n\n 7   ballot image.    The evidence in the record, Judge, is\n\n 8   absolutely clear that every level of government says\n\n 9   uniformly, ballot image equals CVR for electronic voting.\n\n10                    The first page in the packet I handed you\n\n11   is from the United States Election Assistance Commission.\n\n12   As you recall, Judge, we've talked about this before.\n\n13   That commission is a bipartisan commission established\n\n14   after the 2002 Help America Vote Act.        It's bipartisan\n\n15   appointed by both parties in Congress through the\n\n16   president.\n\n17                    They have, then -- that commission has 37\n\n18   advisors and it has 110 standards advisors, people\n\n19   throughout the country.    So you have 37 of the foremost\n\n20   experts in election law and procedure and election\n\n21   computerization.    And then you've got 110, the very, very\n\n22   best advisors, two from each state and then others.\n\n23                    For Texas, importantly, the two advisors\n\n24   are Dana DeBeauvoir, the County Clerk who ran this\n\n25   election, who they're attacking, and Keith Ingram, the\n                           LAURA H.

That's\n\n 2   probably the best example is his reliance on Ballot Now.\n\n 3   There are some other examples that I'm happy to get into;\n\n 4   but I think, overall, he's just -- he's not qualified.\n\n 5                 THE COURT:     You're lodging a challenge to\n\n 6   his qualifications to render opinions, basically.\n\n 7                 MS. PALVINO:     Yes, Judge.\n\n 8                 THE COURT:     Okay.   All right.   I'll let\n\n 9   Mr. Cohen speak to that and then make some decision on it\n\n10   after I hear him speak.    Anything else --\n\n11                 MS. PALVINO:     That's all I have.\n\n12                 THE COURT:     -- Mr. Herring?\n\n13                 MR.

Contestee Casar seeks recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, and\n\nother remedies authorized by Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n(\"CPRC\"). On May 19, 2015, Contestant Laura Pressley filed her Sixth Amended Original\n\nContest (\"Sixth Contest\"). As with her previous Contest pleadings, the Sixth Contest contains\n\nclaims, allegations, and contentions that violate CPRC § 10.001(2)-(3). On May 26,2015, this\n\nCourt granted Casar's no-evidence summary judgment motion, which establishes that Pressley\n\nfailed to raise any genuine issue of material fact in response to Casar's motion. Additionally,\n\nduring the May 26 th hearings, counsel for Travis County and for County Clerk DeBeauvoir\n\ninformed the Court that this case has cost Travis County (and therefore the taxpayers of Travis\n\nCounty) well in excess of $40,000. Accordingly, Casar requests that this Court award against\n\nPressley and her counsel who has signed the Contests the recovery of fees, expenses, and other\n\nappropriate remedies provided by §§ 10.002 and 10.004.\n\n                Allegations Concerning Ballot Images and Cast Vote Records\n\n       2.      As first asserted in her Original Contest pleading! and repeated through all six\n\namended Contests, 2 Pressley alleges that Cast Vote Records (CVRs) are not \"images of ballot\n\n\n1 See Original Contest of Election, U 32-38.\n2 See Second Amended Contest, U 31-37; Third Amended Contest, U 43-53; Fourth Amended Contest,\nU 43-53; Fifth Amended Contest, U 49-59,65; and Amended Contest, U 3,13,82,84,97-138.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    1934\n\fcast\" under the Texas Election Code. But Pressley has asserted no legal basis for those\n\nallegations. Instead, she has testified that it \"makes sense to [her] as a layperson, kind of\n\ncommon knowledge, that an image is a picture of a ballot.,,3 Her contention that a Cast Vote\n\nRecord is not a Ballot Image is flatly inconsistent with the definition of that term as adopted and\n\napplied by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the Texas Secretary of State, Travis\n\nCounty, and the City of Austin. All of those governmental entities uniformly define a Cast Vote\n\nRecord as being synonymous with a Ballot Image. Pressley's factual allegations and legal\n\ncontentions to the contrary violate CPRC §§ 10.001(2) and (3).\n\n                                 Allegations Concerning Zero Tapes\n\n        3.      In <]I 42 of her Sixth Contest, Pressley alleges that \"[re ]view of Discovery\n\ndocuments provided by Travis County [show that] no Zero Tapes (showing the number of votes\n\npresent on the Hart Voting equipment for each candidate when the polls open) were printed\n\nduring Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election Day of the Runoff.\" Pressley\n\nhas similar allegations regarding the lack of Zero Tapes in <]I<]I 3, 8,43, and 64 of the Sixth\n\nContest and throughout her previous Contests. 4 At her deposition, however, Pressley testified\n\nthat she didn't know if Zero Tapes were printed, where they were printed, or when. 5 In fact, Zero\n\nTapes were printed.\n\n        4.      Moreover, Pressley attached the Zero Tapes of one District 4 precinct to her Sixth\n\nContest. See Exhibit C to Pressley's Sixth Contest. Travis County also produced the remaining\n\nZero Tapes for all other District 4 precincts to Pressley and her counsel at the document\n\n\n\n\n3 See Pressley Deposition, p. 58.\n4 See Original Contest, !]I 14; Second Amended Contest, !]I!]I 11, 14; Third Amended Contest, !]I 35; Fourth\nAmended Contest, !]I 35; and Fifth Amended Contest, !]I 41.\n5 See Pressley Deposition, p. 134.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               1935\n\fproduction. Pressley's statements to the contrary are without evidentiary support and therefore\n\nviolate CPRC §§ 10.001(3).\n\n                      Allegations Concerning Changes in Voting Locations\n\n        5.      In her first five versions of her Contest, Pressley alleged that Travis County\n\n\"illegally\" disenfranchised several thousand District 4 voters simply because certain voting\n\n                                                                                          6\nlocations were changed or consolidated for the December 16, 2014 runoff election. Pressley\n\nclaims these voters were \"disenfranchised\" because these voting location changes may have\n\n\"inconvenienced\" some voters. Pressley testified that if a voter had to drive only 20 seconds to a\n\n                                                                                              7\nnew voting location, that 20-second drive would constitute voter disenfranchisement. That\n\nfactual allegation is specious, and Pressley has no legal support for her extreme and frivolous\n\nlegal contention. Further, Pressley admitted in her deposition that she failed to attend the Austin\n\nCity Council meeting at which the Council approved the voting locations for the runoff, and\n\nfailed to have any of her ten campaign staffers attend, to object to the locations or request\n\nalternative locations.\n\n        6.      Apparently recognizing the baseless nature of these allegations, Pressley has\n\nomitted those allegations from her Sixth Contest. Including those contentions in the previous five\n\nContest pleadings violated CPRC §§ 10.001(2) and (3).\n\n                          Allegations Concerning Recount Irregularities\n\n        7.      In versions one through five of her Contest, Pressley alleged that numerous\n\nprocedural irregularities and Election Code violations occurred during the January 6,2015\n\n\n\n\n6 See Original Contest,!]I 13; Second Amended Contest,!]I 13; Third Amended Contest,!]I!]I 12-23; Fourth\nAmended Contest,!]I!]I 12-23; and Fifth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 12-29.\n7 See Pressley Deposition, p. 100-101.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           1936\n\f        8\nrecount. Specifically, Pressley claimed that Travis County improperly started the recount before\n\nthe scheduled start time, that the number of voters on voters lists were not publicly reconciled\n\nwith the recounted ballots, that CVRs were improperly used in the recount, and that the \"sum\n\ntotal of those voting irregularities exceeds the number of votes by which the election was\n\ndecided.\"\n\n        8.      In her Sixth Contest, Pressley and her counsel chose again to include allegations\n\nregarding alleged recount irregularities. 9 These allegations included, among others, that CVRs\n\nwere improperly used in the recount, and that Travis County Director of Elections Michael Winn\n\ncommitted a criminal violation by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the\n\nsource, properties, and copying of the CVR files. 10\n\n        9.      As this Court recognized, allegations relating to the recount are legally irrelevant\n\nbecause this case is an election contest, not a recount contest. 11 Under § 221.003(a) of the\n\nElection Code, Pressley was required to show that the runoff election was not the \"true\n\noutcome.\" Any claim or allegation that some alleged error during the recount could affect the\n\n\"true outcome\" of the election is legally frivolous. By incorporating those claims and legal\n\ncontentions into her Contests, Pressley and her counsel violated CPRC § 10.001(2).\n\n                                     Argument and Authorities\n\n        10.     Section 10.001 of the CPRC provides that the signer of a pleading is certifying\n\nthat each claim, each allegation, and each denial is based on the signatory's best knowledge,\n\ninformation, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry. Sections 10.002 and 10.004 authorize,\n\n\n\n8 See Original Contest,!]I 26-44; Second Amended Contest,!]I 26-44; Third Amended Contest, U 41-66;\nFourth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 41-66; and Fifth Amended Contest, U 47-74.\n9 Sixth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 82-101.\n10 Sixth Amended Contest,!]I!]I 93-95.\n\n11 Order Sustaining Contestee's Special Exceptions to Contestant's Fourth Amended Contest, <]I 7, April\n\n13,2015.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          1937\n\famong other remedies, an award of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the person\n\nwho signs the pleading or the represented party or both. Additionally, § 1O.004(c)(2) authorizes\n\nthe Court to order that those persons pay a penalty into court.\n\n        11.    As described above, Pressley's numerous Contests include many frivolous legal\n\ncontentions and factual allegations that are wholly unsupported by evidence. Incredibly, Pressley\n\nand her counsel have continued to make some of these unfounded allegations in no less than six\n\namendments to her Original Contest of Election. Those allegations have required Casar to incur\n\nsubstantial attorney's fees and expenses, and have required Travis County and the taxpayers to\n\nexpend many of tens of thousands of dollars to address Pressley's unsupported allegations and\n\ndemands.\n\n        12.    Casar requests that the Court award against Pressley and her counsel who signed\n\nthe pleadings (i) the reasonable attorney's fees and expenses Casar has incurred in presenting this\n\nmotion and in defending against the claims, allegations, and contentions identified above; (ii) a\n\npenalty into court; and (iii) that the Court issue an Order granting such other relief as the Court\n\ndeems appropriate under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n                                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                      HERRING & IRWIN, L.L.P.\n                                                      1411 West Avenue, Suite 100\n                                                      Austin, Texas 78701\n                                                      (512) 320-0665\n                                                      (512) 519-7580 - Facsimile\n\n\n                                                      By: lsi Charles Herring, Jr.\n                                                         Charles Herring, Jr. - 09534100\n                                                         cherring@herring-irwin.com\n                                                          Lauren Ross - 24092001\n                                                         laurenbross@gma}Lcom\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      1938\n\f                                                      Kurt Kuhn - 24002433\n                                                      Kurt @KuhnHobbs.com\n                                                      KUHN HOBBS PLLC\n                                                      3307 Northland Drive, # 310\n                                                      Austin, Texas 78731\n                                                      (512) 476-6000\n                                                      (512) 476-6002 - Facsimile\n\n\n                                                      Jessica Palvino - 24048780\n                                                      jpalvino@mcginnislaw.com\n                                                      McGINNIS LOCHRIDGE & KILGORE\n                                                      600 Congress Ave., Ste. 2100\n                                                      Austin, Texas 78701\n                                                      (512) 495-6079\n                                                      (512) 505-6379 - Facsimile\n\n                                                      ATTORNEYS FOR CONTESTEE,\n                                                      GREGORIO \"GREG\" CASAR\n\n\n                                  CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n        I certify that a true and correct copy of the above and foregoing Contestee's Third\nAmended Motion for Sanctions has been delivered to counsel for Contestant by electronic\nservice through the electronic filing manager, or if counsel is not registered with the electronic\nfiling manager, by email, to Mr. Mark Cohen, 805 W. 10th , #100, Austin, Texas 78701 and\nMr. David A.

In compliance with Section 10.005 ofthe Civil Practice and Remedies Code, the\n\nCourt makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law supporting this Order\n\nof sanctions:\n\n                                  FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n9.     In November 2002, Travis County began using the Hart Intercivic eSlate system\n\n(the \"Hart eSlate System\") as an electronic voting system.\n\n10.    Since November 2011, Travis County has used a countywide voting system that\n\nemploys central voting centers. Instead of requiring voters to vote at their home precinct\n\npolling locations, vote centers allow all registered voters in Travis County the option of\n\nvoting at any of the county's polling locations on Election Day.\n\n11.    Pressley and Casar were among eight candidates for the District 4 seat of the\n\nAustin City Council at the November 4, 2014 general election. In the general election,\n\nCasar received the highest number of votes (3,272 or 38.63%), Pressley received the\n\nsecond-highest ( 1,826 or 21.56% ), and the remaining votes were distributed among the\n\nother six candidates.\n\n12.    Some voting locations in the City of Austin were changed between the general\n\nand the runoff elections as is normal practice for a runoff election. For the December 16,\n\n2014 runoff, there were 136 citywide voting locations available to all City of Austin\n\nvoters. The City of Austin gave the public notice of the voting locations for the runoff\n\nelection and an opportunity to comment on the proposed locations. On November 13,\n\n2014, the Austin City Council posted the agenda ofthe November 18,2014 Special\n\nCalled Meeting of the Austin City Council. The agenda included setting the run-off\n\nelection and making provisions for the runoff election. On Tuesday, November 18, 2014,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             21\n\f                                    DC             BK15205 PG2207\n\n\n\n\nthe Austin City Council held the special called meeting and approved an ordinance\n\nordering the runoff election. A list of all polling locations for the runoff was attached to\n\nthe City Council's approved ordinance. The locations were also posted at City Hall and in\n\nthe office of the City Clerk, as well as published in the newspaper. Additionally, the City\n\nof Austin and the Travis County Clerk websites both posted information about the runoff\n\nelection and a list of polling locations.\n\n13.     At the November 18, 2014 Austin City Council meeting, neither Pressley nor any\n\nof her ten campaign workers attended the meeting to lodge any complaint or objections\n\nabout the changes in voting locations. Pressley could have attended the meeting but did\n\nnot. Over the years, she has attended and commented at 30 or more Austin City Council\n\nMeetings. She knows where the agendas are posted, knows how to read them in advance,\n\nand is familiar with the process for commenting at a Council meeting.\n\n14.     Casar won the December 16, 2014 runoff election by a margin of almost 65% to\n\n35%; the difference in their vote totals was 1,291 votes. 4,417 votes were cast in the\n\nDistrict 4 runoff election. Of those votes, 480 were mail-in ballots. The remaining 3,93 7\n\nballots were cast using Travis County's chosen electronic voting system, the Hart eSlate\n\nSystem.\n\n15.     As required by Chapter 122 ofthe Election Code, and after an analysis ofthe Hart\n\neSlate System by a team of computer and election law experts, the Secretary of State\n\nreviewed, approved, and certified the Hart eSlate System. The Secretary of State found\n\nthat the Hart eSlate System fully complied with Election Code requirements and, of\n\nparticular relevance in this case, was \"capable of providing records from which the\n\noperation of the system may be audited[.]\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               22\n\f                                DC             BK15205 PG2208\n\n\n\n\n16.     On January 5, 2015, the day before Casar was to be sworn-in, Pressley filed a\n\nrecount petition with the Secretary of State. Before the recount took place, County Clerk\n\nDana DeBeauvoir offered to run an audit of the election results for Pressley. An audit\n\nwould have provided much more detailed information about the electronic votes than a\n\nrecount, including many of the questions Pressley has presented in this lawsuit. Pressley\n\nrefused DeBeauvoir's offer and demanded a recount. An audit would have provided a\n\nreasonable opportunity to view issues raised in the lawsuit and would have allowed for a\n\nreasonable inquiry into many of the allegations alleged by the Contestant in this lawsuit\n\nto determine ifthere was merit to any of such claims.\n\n17.     On January 6, 2015, Travis County conducted a manual recount of all early,\n\nelection day, mail-in, and provisional ballots. The recount confirmed the election result.\n\nJay Brim, the Chair of the Recount Committee, and Dana DeBeauvoir, the Travis County\n\nClerk, supervised the recount. For votes cast electronically, the recount team printed off\n\nthe Cast Vote Records (CVRs), also called Ballot Images. Pressley witnessed the printing\n\nof the Cast Vote Records. All votes were then manually recounted. Mr. Brim found that\n\nthe totals in all precincts matched those in the original canvas, and that the number of\n\nvoters matched the number of ballots cast. He declared that Casar remained the victor of\n\nthe election.\n\n18.     The Secretary of State had a representative present at the recount-Christina\n\nAdkins. During the recount, Pressley complained to Ms. Adkins that the Cast Vote\n\nRecords were not \"images ofballots cast,\" and pointed to the specific provisions of the\n\nElection Code that she believed were germane. Ms. Adkins witnessed the County's use of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             23\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2209\n\n\n\n\nthe Cast Vote Records for the recount, disagreed with Pressley's interpretation of the\n\nElection Code, and refused to challenge the use of the Cast Vote Records in the recount.\n\n19.    After the recount, Pressley lodged several complaints regarding the recount with\n\nthe Secretary of State. One ofPressley's complaints was that she and her poll watchers\n\nwere not allowed to be present at the printing of the ballots as Pressley believed she was\n\nentitled to view the source, properties, retrieval and counting of the ballots. In its January\n\n20, 2015 response letter to Pressley, the Secretary of State dismissed this complaint and\n\nconfirmed that Pressley had been present when the \"ballot images (also known as 'cast\n\nvote records')\" were printed:\n\n               You state that Travis County conducted activities such as\n               extracting data from the Hart electronic voting system,\n               compiling ballot images onto a centralized system, printing\n               ballot images (also known as \"cast vote records\"), and\n               sorting by mail ballots before the recount was scheduled to\n               begin . . . . [W]e agree with you that you and your\n               representatives under Section 213.013(b) were entitled to\n               be present at the printing of the ballot images, and when\n               you raised this issue with the Travis County Elections\n               Division, Travis County agreed to re-print the ballot images\n               in the presence of you and your watchers.\n\n20.     Responding to a subsequent complaint from Pressley, the Secretary of State again\n\nmade the same point in another letter, dated January 27, 2015. That letter also noted that\n\nan inspector from the Secretary of State's office had confirmed the printing of the ballot\n\nImages:\n\n               You have stated that upon your arrival, you discovered that\n               ballot images had already been printed. You alerted Travis\n               County to the issue and reminded them that you and your\n               watchers were entitled to be present at the printing. In\n               response, Travis County began anew with the printing of\n               the ballot images in the presence of you and your watchers,\n               and only the ballot images printed in your presence were\n               used in the recount. This information is confirmed by the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 24\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2210\n\n\n\n\n                inspector sent by our office to attend the recount.\n                Therefore, our office believes you and your watchers were\n                able to witness the printing of all ballot images used in\n                verifying the vote count in your race.\n\n21.     With the Hart eState System, the permanent record of the vote cast is known as a\n\nCast Vote Record or CVR. A CVR is a data field representation depicting which votes\n\nwere cast on each voting device. The Cast Vote Records are used for counting votes and\n\na visual representation of the CVR can be printed in the event of a recount.\n\n22.     The U.S. Election Assistance Commission is an independent, bipartisan\n\ncommission charged with developing guidance to meet the requirements of the Help\n\nAmerica Vote Act of2002. It is charged by statute with adopting voluntary voting system\n\nguidelines and to serve as a national clearinghouse of information on election\n\nadministration. In its Glossary of Key Election Tenninology, the U.S. Election\n\nAssistance Commission defines \"Cast Vote Record\" as \"a ballot image when used to\n\nrefer to electronic ballots.\"\n\n23.     The Texas Secretary of State defines \"Cast Vote Record\" as a Ballot Image. Ten\n\ndays before Pressley filed this lawsuit, the Secretary of State expressly stated in its\n\nJanuary 20, 2015 letter to Pressley that \"ballot images\" are also known as \"cast vote\n\nrecords.\"\n\n24.     As required by the Election Code, Travis County and the City of Austin used the\n\nSecretary of State's definitions when interpreting the Election Code in this case.\n\n25.     On January 31, 2015, Pressley filed her Original Contest of Election against\n\nCasar, seeking to overturn the results of the runoff election for the Austin City Council\n\nDistrict 4 seat. Pressley's Original Contest was signed by her counsel David Rogers.\n\n26.     In paragraphs 32 through 38, the Original Contest alleged that the Hart eState\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            25\n\f                                DC             BK15205 PG2211\n\n\n\n\nSystem did not comply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast\n\nVote Records, which Pressley claimed were not \"images ofballots cast\" under the Texas\n\nElection Code. In paragraph 13, the Original Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised District 4 voters because certain voting locations were changed between\n\nthe general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 14 and 15, the Original Contest\n\nalleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on Election Day as\n\nrequired by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 26 through 44, the Original\n\nContest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the recount.\n\n27.    On February 18, 2015, Pressley filed her Second Amended Contest. In paragraphs\n\n31 through 37, the Second Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\nIn paragraph 13, the Second Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised District 4 voters because certain voting locations were changed between\n\nthe general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 11 and 14, the Second\n\nAmended Contest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on\n\nElection Day as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 26 through 44,\n\nthe Second Amended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the\n\nrecount.\n\n28.    On February 27, 2015, Pressley filed her Third Amended Contest. In paragraphs\n\n43 through 53, the Third Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              26\n\f                                  DC            BK15205 PG2212\n\n\n\n\nIn paragraphs 12 through 23, the Third Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised District 4 voters because certain voting locations were changed between\n\nthe general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 35 and 37, the Third Amended\n\nContest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on Election\n\nDay as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 41 through 66, the Third\n\nAmended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the recount that\n\nmaterially affected the election results.\n\n29.     On March 12,2015, Pressley filed her Fourth Amended Contest. In paragraphs 43\n\nthrough 53, the Fourth Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\nIn paragraphs 12 through 23, the Fourth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised thousands of District 4 voters because certain voting locations were\n\nchanged between the general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 35 and 37,\n\nthe Fourth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and\n\nresults tapes on Election Day as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs\n\n41 through 66, the Fourth Amended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities\n\noccurred during the recount that materially affected the election results.\n\n30.     On April 16, 2015, the deposition of Pressley took place. At her deposition,\n\nPressley admitted that she could not identify a single voter who was disenfranchised by\n\nthe change in voting locations for the runoff election. Pressley did testify she had spoken\n\nwith people who claimed they had difficulty in voting, but she was not able to obtain\n\neven one affidavit from one voter who claimed to have been disenfranchised. Pressley\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              27\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2213\n\n\n\n\nalso admitted that she did not know what a Cast Vote Record was and that the U.S.\n\nElection Assistance Commission, the Texas Secretary of State, Travis County, and the\n\nCity of Austin all reject her definition of\"ballot image.\" Pressley also testified that she\n\ndid not know if zero tapes had been printed, where they may have been printed, or when.\n\n31.    On April 20, 2015, Pressley filed her Fifth Amended Contest. In paragraphs 49\n\nthrough 59, the Fifth Amended Contest alleged that the Hart eSlate System did not\n\ncomply with the Texas Election Code because it could print only Cast Vote Records,\n\nwhich Pressley claimed were not \"images of ballots cast\" under the Texas Election Code.\n\nIn paragraphs 12 through 29, the Fifth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County\n\ndisenfranchised thousands of District 4 voters because certain voting locations were\n\nchanged between the general election and the runoff election. In paragraphs 41 and 43,\n\nthe Fifth Amended Contest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results\n\ntapes on Election Day as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 47\n\nthrough 74, the Fifth Amended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred\n\nduring the recount that materially affected the election results.\n\n32.    Pressley filed her final and Sixth Amended Contest on May 19, 2015. In\n\nparagraphs 3, 13, 82, 84, and 97 through 138, the Sixth Amended Contest alleged that the\n\nHart eSlate System did not comply with the Texas Election Code because it could print\n\nonly Cast Vote Records, which Pressley claimed were not \"images ofballots cast\" under\n\nthe Texas Election Code. In paragraphs 3, 4, 8, 42 through 52, and 64, the Fifth Amended\n\nContest alleged that Travis County did not print zero tapes and results tapes on Election\n\nDay as required by the Texas Secretary of State. In paragraphs 82 through 101, the Fifth\n\nAmended Contest alleged that procedural irregularities occurred during the recount that\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              28\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2214\n\n\n\n\nmaterially affected the election results. In paragraphs 93 and 94, Pressley alleged that\n\nTravis County Director of Elections Michael Winn committed a criminal violation by not\n\nallowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, properties, and copying of the\n\nCVR files during the recount. Pressley dropped from her Sixth Amended Contest her\n\nallegations that Travis County disenfranchised thousands of District 4 voters because\n\ncertain voting locations were changed between the general election and the runoff\n\nelection.\n\n33.      Travis County produced documents in this case on April22 and 23, 2015. County\n\nClerk Dana DeBeauvoir was deposed on May 11, 2015. The due date for the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment response was May 19,2015. On May 22,2015, County Clerk Dana\n\nDeBeauvoir made changes to her deposition testimony.\n\n34.      On May 26, 2015, after briefing and a hearing, this Court granted Casar's no-\n\nevidence summary judgment motion, which establishes that Pressley failed to raise any\n\ngenuine issue of material fact in response to Casar's motion.\n\n35.      Rogers had prior experience working on election contest cases. According to\n\nRogers, most successful election contests involved a margin of victory of less than 50\n\nvotes.\n\n36.      Before filing the Contests, Rogers had never heard of an election contest case in\n\nwhich a contestant had overcome a margin of victory of 1,291 votes.\n\n37.      Before filing the Contests, Rogers was aware of the Texas Supreme Court\n\ndecision in Andrade v. NAACP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895342\"><a href=\"/opinion/895342/andrade-v-naacp-of-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011), in which the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt rejected an equal-protection challenge to the Hart eSlate System and held that\n\n\"[t[he Secretary [of State] made a reasonable, nondiscriminatory choice to certify the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             29\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2215\n\n\n\n\neSlate, a decision justified by the State's important regulatory interests.\"\n\n38.      The Cast Vote Record is a \"ballot image\" as that term is used in the Texas\n\nElection Code.\n\n39.      The U.S. Election Assistance Commission and Texas Secretary of State have\n\nconsistently stated that for electronic voting, the Cast Vote Record is the Ballot Image.\n\nThe Secretary of State stated this to Pressley explicitly in its January 20, 2015 letter to\n\nher.\n\n40.      The City of Austin and Travis County define a Cast Vote Record as a Ballot\n\nImage.\n\n41.      Texas Election Code § 52.075 gives the Secretary of State authority to prescribe\n\nthe form and content ofballots for electronic voting machines.\n\n42.      Texas Election Code§ 129.002 of the Election Code gives the Secretary of State\n\nthe authority to implement Direct Recording Electronic voting systems that utilize Cast\n\nVote Records.\n\n43.      Pressley and Rogers did not cite the 1990 Federal Election Commission\n\nPerformance and Test Standards until the Sixth Amended Contest, and these standards do\n\nnot distinguish a Ballot Image from a Cast Vote Record. The 2002 Federal Election\n\nCommission Report entitled \"Voting Systems Standards Volume I- Performance\n\nStandards\" defines Ballot Image as \"an electronic record of all votes cast by the voter.\"\n\n44.      Pressley and Rogers did not cite the 2007 Source Code Review of the Hart\n\nIntercivic Voting System until the Sixth Amended Contest, and this report does not\n\ndistinguish a Ballot Image from a Cast Vote Record.\n\n45.      The allegation that the consolidation or changing of voting locations for the runoff\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                30\n\f                                  DC              BK15205 PG2216\n\n\n\n\nelection disenfranchised District 4 voters is not warranted by existing law or by a\n\nnonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment ofnew law.

There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that the consolidation or\n\nchanging of voting locations for the runoff election disenfranchised District 4 voters.\n\n47.    The Texas Secretary of State repeatedly rejected Pressley's complaints regarding\n\nalleged irregularities at the recount, including both at the recount itself and in multiple\n\nsubsequent letters responding to Pressley's complaints.\n\n48.    The allegation that irregularities allegedly occurred during the recount materially\n\naffected the outcome of the runoff election is not warranted by existing law or by a\n\nnonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment of new law.\n\n49.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that irregularities that allegedly\n\noccurred during the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff election.

The allegations that Travis County Director of Elections Michael Winn\n\ncommitted a criminal violation are not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous\n\nargument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\n\n51.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that Travis County Director of\n\nElections Michael Winn committed a Class A misdemeanor criminal violation by not\n\nallowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, properties, and copying of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                31\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2217\n\n\n\n\nCVR files at the recount. The Election Code provides that at a recount, the candidate and\n\nher representatives are entitled to be present \"during the printing of the images [ofballots\n\ncast].\" Pressley and her poll watchers were present while the Travis County recount team\n\nprinted all of the CVRs for the recount. The Secretary of State confirmed this in its\n\nJanuary 27, 2015 letter to Pressley, stating \"Travis County began anew with the printing\n\nof the ballot images in the presence of you and your watchers, and only the ballot images\n\nprinted in your presence were used in the recount. This information is confirmed by the\n\ninspector sent by our office to attend the recount. Therefore, our office believes you and\n\nyour watchers were able to witness the printing of all ballot images used in verifying the\n\nvote count in your race.\"\n\n52.    Pressley and Rogers failed to exercise due diligence in investigating the\n\nevidentiary support for each of the allegations in the Contests before filing them.\n\n53.    Pressley testified that she does not know what a \"Cast Vote Record\" is.\n\n54.    Pressley acknowledged that the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the Texas\n\nSecretary of State, Travis County, and the City of Austin all reject her definition of\n\n\"ballot image.\"\n\n55.     Over 100 counties in Texas use the Hart eSlate System. County Clerk DeBeauvoir\n\ntestified that, before this lawsuit, she had never heard anyone ever allege that CVRs are\n\nnot ballot images for purposes of electronic voting. She also serves on the Standards\n\nBoard for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\n56.     County Clerk DeBeauvoir fully complied with the Texas Election Code and\n\nSecretary of State procedures in conducting the general and runoff elections.\n\n57.     Pressley failed to exercise her right to comment on or object to any of the voting\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               32\n\f                                    DC           BK15205 PG2218\n\n\n\n\nlocation changes at the Austin City Council meeting.\n\n58.    Consolidating voting locations between a general election and a runoff election is\n\na routine and entirely legal and proper practice. Such changes occur for a variety of\n\nlegitimate reasons, including to achieve cost and staffing efficiencies due to the lower\n\nvoter turnout and fewer number of candidates generally associated with runoffs. In this\n\nelection, a total of304 candidates were on the ballot countywide at the November 4, 2014\n\ngeneral election. By contrast, in the runoff election in District 4, only four races were on\n\nthe ballot: this Council race, the Mayor's race, and 2 school district races-a total of\n\neight candidates.\n\n59.     Because Travis County uses countywide voting centers, any voter in Travis\n\nCounty could vote at any one ofthe 136 voting locations across the county for the runoff\n\nelection. In District 4 alone, there were 9 voting centers within the district, as well as 7\n\ncenters located within a five-minute drive of the district and 17 centers located within a\n\nten-minute drive of the district.\n\n60.     Pressley testified if a voter had to drive as little as 20 seconds to a new voting\n\nlocation, that voter was disenfranchised.\n\n61.     Rogers did not identify a single witness who could or would testify that changes\n\nin voting locations had disenfranchised District 4 voters.\n\n62.     When Pressley was deposed on Aprill6, 2015, she could not identify a single\n\nvoter who was disenfranchised as a result of the changes in voting locations. Four days\n\nlater, on April20, 2015, she filed her Fifth Amended Contest, which alleged in Paragraph\n\n29 that 1,108 voters, at least, were disenfranchised as a result of the change in voting\n\nlocation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               33\n\f                                  DC              BK15205 PG2219\n\n\n\n\n63.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that the Austin City Council\n\nchanged the voting locations for the runoff to disenfranchise any District 4 voters.\n\n64.     There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that the changes in the voting\n\nlocations for the runoff resulted in the disenfranchisement of any District 4 voters.\n\n65.     There is no evidentiary support that any voter was actually prevented from voting\n\nat the new locations.\n\n66.     Paragraph 42 of Pressley's Sixth Amended Contest states that \"[r]eview of\n\nDiscovery documents provided by Travis County [shows that] no Zero Tapes (showing\n\nthe number of votes present on the Hart Voting equipment for each candidate when the\n\npolls open) were printed during Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election\n\nDay of the Runoff.\" Similar allegations are contained in ,-r,-r 3, 8, 43, & 64 of the Sixth\n\nAmended Contest and in prior Contests.\n\n67.     Zero Tapes were produced to Pressley and Rogers by Travis County during their\n\ndocument production on April22 and 23, 2015. Pressley's Sixth Amended Contest was\n\nfiled on May 19, 2015.\n\n68.     Travis County printed zero tapes both before the runoff election and on the day of\n\nthe runoff election. There is no evidentiary support for the allegation that zero tapes were\n\nnot printed on the day of the runoff election.\n\n69.     Pressley and Rogers attached as Exhibit C to the Sixth Contest a zero tape that\n\nwas printed on December 16, 2014, the day of the runoff election.\n\n70.     Results tapes were printed the day of the runoff election. There is no evidentiary\n\nsupport for the allegation that results tapes were not printed as required by the Texas\n\nSecretary of State.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               34\n\f                                  DC              BK15205 PG2220\n\n\n\n\n71.     Pressley took a personal and participatory role in this lawsuit. Pressley testified\n\nshe personally authored portions of the Contests and their appendices. She estimated that\n\nshe spent hours and hours working on the lawsuit and that she had worked until 3 :00 a.m.\n\ndrafting the Contests. Pressley was present at the deposition of County Clerk\n\nDeBeauvoir, as well as the two-day document production by the County Clerk's office.\n\n72.     Pressley testified at least three people assisted her in drafting discovery and with\n\nvarious other aspects of this election contest.\n\n73.     Pressley testified Contestee Casar has done nothing wrong in the conduct of the\n\nelection.\n\n74.     Pressley testified she has assets and income sufficient to be able to pay a\n\nmonetary sanction.

Rogers failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether each allegation (that\n\nirregularities that allegedly occurred during the recount materially affected the outcome\n\nof the runoff election) was warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for\n\nthe extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n84.    Rogers knew or should have known this allegation (that irregularities that\n\nallegedly occurred during the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff\n\nelection) was not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n85.    A reasonable inquiry would have revealed irregularities that allegedly occurred\n\nduring the recount did not materially affect the outcome of the runoff election.\n\n86.    The allegations that irregularities that allegedly occurred during the recount\n\nmaterially affected the outcome of the runoff election were not supported by existing law\n\nand there was not a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of\n\nexisting law or the establishment of new law.\n\n87.    By failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether the legal contentions in\n\nthe Contests were warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law, Rogers violated Section 10.001 (2) of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               37\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2223\n\n\n\n\n88.    By asserting legal contentions in the Contests that were not warranted by existing\n\nlaw or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing\n\nlaw, Rogers violated Section 10.001(2) ofthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n89.    This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers because of this\n\nviolation of Section 10.001 (2). This authority arises from Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that determines that a person\n\nhas signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001 may impose a sanction on\n\nthe person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n90.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, Fifth Amended, and Sixth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley\n\ncertified that, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after\n\nreasonable inquiry, each allegation or other factual contention in the Contests had\n\nevidentiary support, including the allegation that irregularities that allegedly occurred\n\nduring the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff election.\n\n91.

At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, Fifth Amended, and Sixth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley\n\nknew or should have known their allegation that irregularities that allegedly occurred\n\nduring the recount materially affected the outcome of the runoff election did not have\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 38\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2224\n\n\n\n\nevidentiary support.\n\n93.    The allegation that irregularities that allegedly occurred during the recount\n\nmaterially affected the outcome of the runoff election has no evidentiary support.\n\n94.    By failing to make a reasonable inquiry into whether factual claims in the\n\nContests had evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe\n\nCivil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n95.    By asserting factual claims in the Contests that Pressley and Rogers knew were\n\nwithout evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code.\n\n96.    This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers and on Laura\n\nPressley because of this violation of Section 10.001 (3 ). This authority arises from Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001\n\nmay impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n97.    Travis County Director of Elections Michael Winn did not commit a criminal\n\nviolation by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, properties,\n\nand copying of the CVR files during the recount.\n\n98.    At the time the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers certified that to the best\n\nof his knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, that the\n\nallegation that Mr. Winn committed a criminal violation by not allowing Pressley and her\n\npoll watchers to view the source, property, and copying of the CVR files was warranted\n\nby existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or\n\nreversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              39\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2225\n\n\n\n\n99.    Rogers failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether this allegation (that\n\nMichael Winn committed a criminal violation) was warranted by existing law or by a\n\nnon-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment of new law.\n\n100.   Rogers knew that this allegation (that Michael Winn committed a criminal\n\nviolation) was not warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n101.   A reasonable inquiry would have revealed that Mr. Winn did not violate Texas\n\nElection Code§ 33.061 by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source\n\nand properties of the CVR files during the recount; that, under Election Code§ 213.016,\n\nPressley and her poll watchers were allowed to be and were present for the printing of the\n\nCVRs; and that nothing in the Election Code authorized Pressley or her poll watchers to\n\nview the source and properties of the CVR files, such as dates of the CVR files and\n\norigination.\n\n102.   The allegations that Mr. Winn committed criminal violations were not supported\n\nby existing law and there was not a non-frivolous argument for the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n103.   By failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether the legal contentions in\n\nthe Contests were warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law, Rogers violated Section 10.001(2) of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n104.

At the time the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley certified\n\nthat, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief: formed after reasonable\n\ninquiry, each allegation or other factual contention in the Contests had evidentiary\n\nsupport, including the allegation that Mr. Winn committed a criminal violation by not\n\nallowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source, property, and copying of the\n\nCVR files.\n\n107.   At the time that the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley failed\n\nto conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether their allegation (that Mr. Winn committed a\n\ncriminal violation by not allowing Pressley and her poll watchers to view the source,\n\nproperty, and copying of the CVR files) had evidentiary support.\n\n108.

No credible evidence exists to prove that any Travis County voters were\n\ndisenfranchised by the consolidation of voting locations between the general election,\n\nheld on November 4, 2014 and the runoff election held on December 16, 2014.\n\n114.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers certified that to his best\n\nknowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, that the allegation\n\nthat Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by consolidating voting\n\nlocations was warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n115.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers failed to conduct a reasonable\n\ninquiry in whether this allegation (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              42\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2228\n\n\n\n\nvoters by consolidating voting locations) was supported by existing law or a non-\n\nfrivolous argument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment of new law.\n\n116.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers knew or should have known\n\nthat this allegation (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by\n\nconsolidating voting locations) was unsupported by existing law or a non-frivolous\n\nargument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of\n\nnew law.\n\n11 7.   A reasonable inquiry would have revealed that existing law did not support the\n\nallegation that voters had been illegally disenfranchised by the consolidation of voting\n\nlocations, and that there was not a non-frivolous argument for the extension,\n\nmodification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\n\n118.    By failing to conduct a reasonable inquiry into whether the legal contentions in\n\nthe Contests were warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the\n\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law, Rogers violated Section 10.001 (2) of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n119.    By asserting legal contentions in the Contests that were not warranted by existing\n\nlaw or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing\n\nlaw, Rogers violated Section 10.001(2) ofthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n120.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley certified that, to\n\nthe best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             43\n\f                                  DC            BK15205 PG2229\n\n\n\n\neach allegation or other factual contention in the Contest had evidentiary support,\n\nincluding the allegations that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by\n\nconsolidating voting locations.\n\n121.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, and Fourth\n\nAmended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry\n\ninto whether these factual allegations (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised\n\nDistrict 4 voters by consolidating voting locations) had evidentiary support.\n\n122.    At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, and Fourth\n\nAmended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley knew that these factual allegations\n\n(that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by consolidating voting\n\nlocations) had no evidentiary support.\n\n123.   At the time that the Fifth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley knew\n\nthat these allegations (that Travis County illegally disenfranchised District 4 voters by\n\nconsolidating voting locations) did not have evidentiary support. Pressley testified four\n\ndays prior to filing the Fifth Amended Contest that she could not identify a single voter\n\nwho was disenfranchised due to the change in voting locations. Pressley testified that\n\nregardless of the fact that she could not obtain one affidavit from one voter attesting to\n\ndisenfranchisement of voters, she made her claims based on statistical analysis of prior\n\nvoting patterns and conversations she had with persons she could not identify.\n\n124.   The allegation that Travis County illegally disenfranchised thousands of District 4\n\nvoters by consolidating voting locations has no evidentiary support.\n\n125.   By failing to make a reasonable inquiry into whether factual claims in the\n\nContests had evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              44\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2230\n\n\n\n\nCivil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n126.   By asserting factual claims in the Contests that Pressley and Rogers knew were\n\nwithout evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) ofthe Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code.\n\n127.   This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers and Laura\n\nPressley because of this violation of Section 10.001 (3). This authority arises from Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001\n\nmay impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n128.   Travis County printed zero tapes and results tapes for the runoff election as\n\nrequired by the Texas Secretary of State. Some of the zero tapes were printed prior to the\n\ndate ofthe run-off election held on December 16,2014.\n\n129.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley certified that, to\n\nthe best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry,\n\neach allegation or other factual contention in the Contest had evidentiary support,\n\nincluding the allegations that Travis County failed to print zero tapes and results tapes in\n\naccordance with the Texas Secretary of State's requirements.\n\n130.   At the time that the Sixth Amended Contest was filed, Rogers and Pressley\n\ncertified that, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after\n\nreasonable inquiry, each allegation or other factual contention in the Contest had\n\nevidentiary support, including the allegations that \"discovery documents provided by\n\nTravis County [shows that] no Zero Tapes (showing the number of votes present on the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               45\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2231\n\n\n\n\nHart Voting equipment for each candidate when the polls open) were printed during\n\nEarly Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on Election Day of the Runoff.\"\n\n131.   At the time that the Original, Second Amended, Third Amended, Fourth\n\nAmended, and Fifth Amended Contests were filed, Rogers and Pressley knew that these\n\nallegations (that Travis County failed to print zero tapes and results tapes in accordance\n\nwith the Texas Secretary of State's requirements) lacked evidentiary support.\n\n132.

Zero Tapes were produced by Travis County during their document\n\nproduction on April22 and 23, 2015. Pressley's Sixth Amended Contest was filed on\n\nMay 19,2015. Pressley and Rogers attached as Exhibit C to the Sixth Contest a zero tape\n\nthat was printed on December 16, 2014, the day of the runoff election. County Clerk\n\nDana DeBeauvoir testified in her deposition on May 11, 2015 that zero tapes and results\n\ntapes were printed.\n\n134.

The allegations that discovery documents provided by Travis County showed that\n\nno Zero Tapes were printed during Early Voting and no Zero Tapes were printed on\n\nElection Day of the Runoffhas no evidentiary support.\n\n136.    By failing to make a reasonable inquiry into whether factual claims in the\n\nContests had evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) of the\n\nCivil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n137.    By asserting factual claims in the Contests that Pressley and Rogers knew were\n\nwithout evidentiary support, Pressley and Rogers violated Section 10.001(3) of the Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code.\n\n138.    This Court has authority to impose a sanction on David Rogers and Laura\n\nPressley because ofthis violation ofSection 10.001(3). This authority arises from Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code Section 10.004, which states that \"a court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section 10.001\n\nmay impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or both.\"\n\n139.    The factors articulated by the Texas Supreme Court in Low v. Henry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894843\"><a href=\"/opinion/894843/low-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2007), support an award of sanctions in this case.\n\n140.    The first Low factor, the good faith or bad faith of the offender, weighs in favor of\n\nawarding sanctions. Pressley's conduct during the case, including making false\n\nallegations of criminal activity against the Travis County Director of Elections Michael\n\nWinn, indicate that she was not acting in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                47\n\f                                  DC            BK15205 PG2233\n\n\n\n\n141.    The second Low factor, the degree of willfulness, vindictiveness, negligence, or\n\nfrivolousness involved in the offense, weighs heavily in favor of sanctions. Pressley lost\n\nthe election by a margin of 1,291 votes, a margin far greater than Rogers had ever seen\n\nand greater than has been overcome in the history of reported Texas jurisprudence. The\n\nHart eSlate system, which Pressley alleges violated the Texas Election Code, was\n\ncertified by the Texas Secretary of State and variations of the system have been used in\n\nother counties in Texas. There are two court decisions rejecting attacks on the Hart eSlate\n\nsystem. In the Andrade v. NAACP case, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895342\"><a href=\"/opinion/895342/andrade-v-naacp-of-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011), the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt found that \"[t]he Secretary made a reasonable, nondiscriminatory choice to certify\n\nthe eSlate, a decision justified by the State's important regulatory interests.\" In Texas\n\nDemocratic Party v. Williams, No. A-07-CA-115-SS (W.O. Tex. Aug. 16, 2007), the\n\nWestern District of Texas noted that the Secretary of State \"made a reasonable, politically\n\nneutral, and non-discriminatory choice to certify the eSlate voting machines for use in\n\nelections, and nothing in the Constitution forbids this choice.\" Rogers was either aware of\n\nor failed to adequately investigate the legal and factual bases for Pressley's allegations.\n\n142.   The third Low factor, the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the offender,\n\nalso weighs in favor of awarding sanctions. Rogers is an experienced attorney who has\n\nhandled election contests previously and holds himself out as being knowledgeable\n\nregarding election contests. Pressley has a PhD in Chemistry, is actively involved in her\n\ncommunity, and has appeared before Austin City Council at least thirty times. She was\n\npersonally involved in drafting portions of the Contests and discovery.\n\n143.    The fourth Low factor, any prior history of sanctionable conduct on the part of the\n\noffender, is not applicable in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              48\n\f                                  DC             BK15205 PG2234\n\n\n\n\n144.    The fifth Low factor, the reasonableness and necessity of the out-of-pocket\n\nexpenses incurred by the offended person as a result of the misconduct, weighs in favor\n\nof awarding sanctions. Contestee Casar seeks the reasonable and necessary attorney's\n\nfees incurred in defending this election contest, and his attorneys are charging a reduced\n\nhourly rate. Casar has not yet paid any of his attorney fees.\n\n145.    The sixth Low factor, the nature and extent of prejudice, apart from out-of-pocket\n\nexpenses, suffered by the offended person as a result of the misconduct, also weighs in\n\nfavor of awarding sanctions. Contestee Casar is now a Council Member for the City of\n\nAustin, and has been required to divide his time between his duties as a Council Member\n\nand responding to Pressley's Election Contests. His city council annual salary is\n\napproximately $70,000.00.\n\n146.    The seventh Low factor, the relative culpability of client and counsel, also weighs\n\nin favor of awarding sanctions. Pressley took a personal and participatory role in this\n\nlawsuit. She testified she drafted portions of the Contests, drafted discovery questions to\n\nTravis County for Rogers to decide how to use, and was, according to Rogers, the most\n\nhands-on client he's ever had.\n\n14 7.   The eighth Low factor, the risk of chilling the specific type of litigation involved,\n\nalso weighs in favor of awarding sanctions. There should not be a chilling effect from\n\nawarding sanctions in this case, as the purpose of sanctions in this case would be to\n\nencourage compliance with Chapter 10.\n\n148.    The ninth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offender, including the\n\noffender's ability to pay a monetary sanction, also weighs in favor of awarding sanctions.\n\nPressley has assets and income potential due to her high level of education sufficient to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                49\n\f                                 DC             BK15205 PG2235\n\n\n\n\njustify the award of sanctions. Rogers has the ability to earn income sufficient to justify\n\nthe award of sanctions.\n\n149.    The tenth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offended party, including\n\nthe offended person's need for compensation, also weighs in favor of awarding sanctions.\n\nPressley testified she knew of nothing Contestee Casar did wrong in the conduct of the\n\nelection. Because of Pressley's election contest, Contestee Casar has incurred more than\n\n$150,000 in attorney's fees and has been unable to fully devote himself to his role as City\n\nCouncilmember. His annual income as a council member is far less than Ms. Pressley's.\n\n150.    The eleventh Low factor, the relative magnitude of sanction necessary to achieve\n\nthe goal or goals of the sanction, also weighs in favor of awarding sanctions. The goals in\n\nawarding sanctions, according to the Texas Supreme Court in Remington Arms v.\n\nCaldwell are compensation, punishment, and deterrence. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1717670\"><a href=\"/opinion/1717670/remington-arms-co-inc-v-caldwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1993).\n\nThe Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code Section 10.004 states that the sanction\n\nmust be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable\n\nconduct by others similarly situated. The same challenge to the Hart eSlate voting system\n\nthat was brought by Pressley in this Election Contest could have been brought against any\n\nelected official in Austin, Travis County, or the hundreds of other counties in Texas that\n\nuse the eSlate voting machine. It is important to deter these types of challenges to the\n\nHart eSlate voting system, which has been fully approved and certified by the Texas\n\nSecretary of State.\n\n151.    The twelfth Low factor, burdens on the court system attributable to the\n\nmisconduct, including consumption of judicial time and incurrence of juror fees and other\n\ncourt costs, have to date minimal impact in favor of awarding sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              50\n\f                                 DC            BK15205 PG2236\n\n\n\n\n152.   The thirteenth Low factor, the degree to which the offended person's own\n\nbehavior caused the expenses for which recovery is sought, also weighs in favor of\n\nawarding sanctions. Pressley admits that Casar did nothing wrong in the conduct of the\n\nelection.\n\n153.    Rogers and Pressley failed to show due diligence in violation of Section 10.002 of\n\nthe Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n154.    All Conclusions of Law shall also be deemed to be Findings of Fact. To the extent\n\nany Conclusion of Law is a Finding of Fact or is a mixed question oflaw and fact, the\n\nsame is found as a fact.\n\nIT SO ORDERED.                tL\n        SIGNED this the    2} day of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             51\n\f                                                                                    Filed in The District Court\n                                       DC                  BK15212 PG776             of Travis County, Texas\n\n                                                                                          JUL 2 3 2015 q\n                                                                                   At\n                                                                                            (           .0\n                                                                                           I 0'0.:.:Y AM.\n                                      NO.
