Goldstein\n       Washington, D.C. 20507\n\n        Attorney for EEOC\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nSLOVITER, Circuit Judge.\n\nI.\n\nPlaintiff-appellant Gerard Cardenas, a Mexican-American,\nwas hired as of January 29, 1990 as the manager of the\nOffice Systems Unit in the Information Systems Division\n(\"ISD\") of New Jersey's Administrative Office of the Courts\n(\"AOC\") following the retirement of Joseph Ribsam.\nCardenas asserts that through 1989 every manager or\nsupervisor in the ISD was a white non-Hispanic male.\nAppellee James Rebo, head of the ISD, had advertised the\nposition at pay grades G-32 and G-30. Cardenas was\nappointed at the G-30 level. Cardenas resigned on March 1,\n1996. On August 23, 1996, he filed this suit against Jon\nMassey, his immediate supervisor, and Rebo (individually\nand in their official capacities), as well as Robert Lipscher,\nDirector of the AOC (individually), James Ciancia\n(Lipscher's successor, in his official capacity), Deborah\nPoritz (New Jersey's Chief Justice, in her official capacity),\n\n                                  2\n\fand the State of New Jersey. The complaint stated\ndisparate pay, hostile work environment, and retaliation\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. S 1981, 42 U.S.C. S 2000e, et seq.\n(\"Title VII\"), and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination\n(\"LAD\"), N.J. Stat. Ann. S 10:5-1, et seq., and a common law\nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against\nMassey. Essentially, the claims raised in Cardenas' 128\nparagraph complaint revolve around his contention that he\nwas hired at a lower grade level than merited by the work\nhe was assigned, received disparate pay as a result, was\nnot promoted as merited, was the subject of retaliation, and\nwas subject to a hostile work environment, all as a result\nof his ethnicity.\n\nAfter discovery, the defendants moved for summary\njudgment and Cardenas moved for partial summary\njudgment on his disparate pay claims. The District Court\ngranted defendants' motion, except as to the LAD and\nS 1981 hostile work environment claims against defendant\nMassey, and denied Cardenas' motion by opinion dated\nDecember 2, 1999 (hereafter \"Dec. 2 opinion\"). The court\nsubsequently denied Cardenas' motion for reargument by\nopinion dated February 2, 2000. Cardenas settled his\nclaims against Massey, resolving the remainder of the\naction. He then filed a timely notice of appeal as to the\nremaining defendants. On appeal, the EEOC has filed an\namicus curiae brief solely as to the issue of the proper\napplication of the statute of limitations to disparate pay\nclaims.\n\nThe District Court had jurisdiction over this action under\n28 U.S.C. SS 1331, 1343, 1367. This court has appellate\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nII.\n\nCardenas has set forth a litany of incidents from his six\nyears employment at the AOC that he contends show\ndiscrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment.\nOur review of the grant of summary judgment is plenary.\nSee Wheeler v. Towanda Area Sch. Dist., 950 F.2d 128, 129\n(3d Cir. 1991).\n\n                                3\n\fFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides for\nsummary judgment when \"there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a\njudgment as a matter of law.\" An issue is genuine if \"the\nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a\nverdict for the nonmoving party.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). In Anderson , the Court\nexplained that the judge's role when adjudicating a motion\nfor summary judgment \"is not himself to weigh the evidence\nand determine the truth of the matter but to determine\nwhether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Id. at 249. In\nmaking this determination, a court is to draw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the non-moving party. See Berner Int'l\nCorp. v. Mars Sales Co., 987 F.2d 975, 978 (3d Cir. 1993).\nIn other words, Rule 56(c) \"mandates the entry of summary\njudgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon\nmotion, against a party who fails to make a showing\nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential\nto that party's case, and on which that party will bear the\nburden of proof at trial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n317, 322 (1986).\n\nIII.\n\nCardenas' disparate pay claims stem, at least in part,\nfrom his initial hiring at the G-30 level. Cardenas contends\nthat he performed all of the responsibilities of his\npredecessor, who was Chief, Office Services Systems, a G-\n31, and came to assume additional ones (the \"PC/LAN\nduties\"). He contends that Richard Chelenza, another mid-\nlevel ISD manager, previously had the PC/LAN duties and,\nas a result, Chelenza's pay grade had been raised from G-\n31 to G-33 at Rebo's request. He claims he resolved LAN\nproblems caused by inadequate materials supplied to the\nAOC by AT&T, negotiating a deal with the company\nwhereby it replaced over $400,000 of defective materials\nand yet he remained at pay level G-30, the grade he held\nthroughout his six-year tenure at the AOC.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. After June 1994, all AOC managers' salaries were frozen. It is not\nclear whether the freeze applied to promotions.\n\n                               4\n\fThe District Court recognized that Cardenas asserted\nthree legal bases for his wage discrimination claim--\nS 1981, LAD, and Title VII, and that a separate limitations\nperiod applies to each. Cardenas' S 1981 claims are subject\nto a two-year statute of limitations. See Goodman v. Lukens\nSteel Co., 482 U.S. 656, 662 (1987); N.J. Stat. Ann.\nS 2A:14-2. A two-year statute of limitations also applies to\nLAD claims whose \"operative facts\" occurred after July 27,\n1993, whereas LAD claims based on events occurring\nbefore this date are subject to a six-year statute of\nlimitations. See Martinez v. Nat'l Broadcasting Co., 877 F.\nSupp. 219, 230 (D.N.J. 1994); Montells v. Haynes , 133 N.J.\n282, 286, 627 A.2d 654, 655 (1993). Title VII claims must\nbe the subject of a charge filed with the EEOC within either\n180 days or 300 days of the complained-of unlawful\nemployment practice, depending upon whether the state\nhas an anti-discrimination law, see Miller v. Beneficial\nMgmt. Corp., 977 F.2d 834, 842 (3d Cir. 1992), and a\ncomplaint must be filed in the district court within 90 days\nof receipt of a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, see 42\nU.S.C. S 2000e-5(f)(1). The District Court calculated that to\nmaintain an action for disparate pay based on his pay\ngrade under Title VII, Cardenas had to file a complaint with\nthe EEOC on or before July 29, 19902; to maintain a S 1981\naction, he had to file his complaint in the district court on\nor before January 29, 1992; and to maintain an action\nunder LAD, he had to file his complaint in the district court\non or before January 29, 1996.\n\nThe District Court found that because Cardenas'\ndisparate pay claims stem from his initial pay grade\nclassification, they accrued when he began working at the\nAOC on January 29, 1990, and are therefore time-barred.\nIt rejected Cardenas' argument that each paycheck he\nreceived over the course of his AOC employment, which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The court incorrectly believed that under Title VII Cardenas' claims\nhad to be presented to the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged unlawful\nemployment practice. In fact, because New Jersey has an anti-\ndiscrimination law, a claim must be presented to the EEOC within 300\ndays of the alleged unlawful employment practice. See 42 U.S.C.\nS 2000e-5(e)(1), construed in Seredinski v. Clifton Precision Prods., 776\nF.2d 56, 61-62 (3d Cir. 1985).\n\n                               5\n\fended on March 1, 1996, constituted a separate\ndiscriminatory act that brought his claims within the\nstatutes of limitations pursuant to the continuing violations\ndoctrine. See Miller, 977 F.2d at 842 (\"[I]f the alleged\ndiscriminatory conduct is a `continuing violation,' the\nstatute of limitations begins to run on the date of the last\noccurrence of discrimination, rather than the first.\"). Citing,\ninter alia, Lorance v. AT&T Techs., Inc., 490 U.S. 900\n(1989), rev'd by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, S 112,\nDelaware State Coll. v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980),\nand United Airlines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 560\n(1977), the court found the continuing violations doctrine\ninapplicable because Cardenas described his pay checks as\n\"consequences\" of his pay grade and did not allege the\nAOC's pay-grade structure was facially discriminatory.\n\nWe believe that is too narrow a reading of the facts and\nthe law. In Evans, the discrimination, which was forcing\nplaintiff to resign when she married, occurred outside the\nstatutory period. Although she was rehired within the\nstatutory period, her seniority was calculated from the date\nof her re-hire. The Supreme Court rejected plaintiff 's\nargument that this application of the seniority system\nconstituted a continuing violation because it gave present\neffect to the employer's past discriminatory act by\ndisregarding the seniority she had accrued before her\nforced resignation. The Court held that no present violation\nexisted because the seniority system, its adoption, and its\noperation were nondiscriminatory. See Evans, 431 U.S. at\n557-60.\n\nIn Ricks, the employer College denied the plaintiff\nprofessor tenure and gave him a \"terminal\" one-year\ncontract pursuant to College policy. The tenure denial was\noutside the statutory period, but plaintiff 's final day of\nemployment was not, and he argued that his discharge was\na continuing violation. The Court disagreed, finding that it\nwas \"a delayed, but inevitable, consequence of the denial of\ntenure. In order for the limitations periods to commence\nwith the date of discharge, Ricks would have had to allege\nand prove that the manner in which his employment was\nterminated differed discriminatorily from the manner in\nwhich the College terminated other professors who also had\n\n                               6\n\fbeen denied tenure.\" Ricks, 449 U.S. at 257-58. The Court\ncited Evans for the proposition that we look not for\ncontinuing effects but for present acts of discrimination. Id.\n\nIn Lorance, the plaintiffs were demoted under a facially\nneutral seniority system, operated in a non-discriminatory\nmanner but allegedly adopted with a discriminatory\npurpose outside the statutory period. The Court, citing\nEvans, Ricks, and the special status of seniority systems in\ndiscrimination law, Lorance, 490 U.S. at 911-12, declined\nto apply the continuing violations doctrine, holding that\n\"[b]ecause the claimed invalidity of the . . . seniority system\nis wholly dependent on the alleged illegality of signing the\nunderlying [collective bargaining] agreement, it is the date\nof that signing which governs the limitations period.\" Id. at\n911.\n\nIn all three cases, the Supreme Court held there was no\ncontinuing violation where the effects of prior\ndiscriminatory acts, but no actual discrimination, occurred\nwithin the limitations period. The Evans-Ricks-Lorance line\nof cases bars claims where the relevant aspect of the\nemployment system (such as promotion, seniority, or\ntermination) is facially neutral, and any discrete\ndiscriminatory conduct took place and ceased outside the\nperiod of limitations. As the Lorance Court observed, \"[w]ith\na facially neutral system the discriminatory act occurs only\nat the time of adoption, for each application is\nnondiscriminatory.\" Id. at 912 n.5. However, this line of\ncases does not bar claims based on conduct which is\nalleged to have \"continued to discriminate unlawfully each\ntime it was applied.\" Anderson v. Zubieta, 180 F.3d 329,\n336 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\nHere, Cardenas alleges the decision not to promote him,\nor increase his wage level to one appropriate to his skills,\nwas made on an ongoing basis. The facially-neutral-system\nanalysis of Evans, Ricks, and Lorance is thus inapposite. A\nmore pertinent Supreme Court decision is Bazemore v.\nFriday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986), where the Court reversed the\ndismissal of a Title VII disparate pay claim on statute of\nlimitations grounds and held that each of plaintiffs' pay\nchecks constituted a distinct violation of their right to\nnondiscriminatory compensation. The Court stated that the\n\n                               7\n\flimitations defense could not be based on the ground that\nthe disparities stemmed from discriminatory policies pre-\ndating the effective date of Title VII, explaining:\n\n       that the [employer] discriminated with respect to\n       salaries prior to the time it was covered by Title VII\n       does not excuse perpetuating that discrimination after\n       [it] became covered by Title VII. . . . A pattern or\n       practice that would have constituted a violation of Title\n       VII, but for the fact that the statute had not yet\n       become effective, became a violation upon Title VII's\n       effective date, and to the extent an employer continued\n       to engage in that act or practice, it is liable under that\n       statute. . . . Each week's paycheck that delivers less to\n       a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong\n       actionable under Title VII, regardless of the fact that this\n       pattern was begun prior to the effective date of Title VII.\n\nBazemore, 478 U.S. at 395-96 (third emphasis added)\n(Brennan, J., concurring in part, joined by all members of\nthe Court).\n\nThereafter, in Miller v. Beneficial Management Corp., 977\nF.2d 834 (3d Cir. 1992), a case brought under the Equal\nPay Act rather than Title VII, this court came to a similar\nconclusion. We held that the statute of limitations for an\nEPA claim began to run on the date the plaintiff received\nher last allegedly discriminatory paycheck. In fact,\"[m]ost\ncourts appear to treat pay discrimination claims as\ncontinuing violations.\" Miller, 977 F.2d at 843. Certainly, in\nthis circuit, \" `discriminatory wage payments constitute a\ncontinuing violation. . . . To hold otherwise would permit\nperpetual wage discrimination by an employer whose\nviolation . . . had already lasted without attack for [longer\nthan the limitations period].' \" Id. (quoting Hodgson v.\nBehrens Drug Co., 475 F.2d 1041, 1050 (5th Cir. 1973)).\n\nThe EEOC filed its brief as amicus curiae in this case\nbecause of its view that the District Court erroneously\napplied the statute of limitations to Cardenas' Title VII\nclaim. The EEOC states that \"both Bazemore and Miller\ncontemplate that an individual may challenge allegedly\ndiscriminatory wage payments so long as one such\npayment falls within the limitations period.\" Br. of EEOC at\n\n                                8\n\f14. It further states that \"Cardenas received allegedly\ndiscriminatory paychecks within 300 days prior to the filing\nof his administrative charge, and so his claim should have\nbeen deemed timely.\" Id. at 10. The EEOC argues that if the\nDistrict Court's opinion is allowed to stand, it\"would\nfrustrate enforcement of Title VII by improperly insulating\ncurrent discriminatory conduct from challenge under the\nstatute.\" Id. at 1.\n\nIn its opinion on Cardenas' request for reargument, the\nDistrict Court rejected Cardenas' argument that it had\noverlooked the Miller decision. The court first noted that\nCardenas had not cited Miller and then held that Miller was\nnot controlling because it analyzed the statute of limitations\nunder the Equal Pay Act whereas Cardenas sued under\nTitle VII. However, the Supreme Court's opinion in\nBazemore concerns a Title VII claim. Moreover, application\nof the continuing violations doctrine is not dependent on\nwhich statute gives rise to the plaintiff 's claim. See\nBrinkley-Obu v. Hughes Training, Inc., 36 F.3d 336, 345-51\n(4th Cir. 1994) (applying continuing violation theory to both\nTitle VII and EPA disparate pay claims). Although Miller\nmay have been brought under a different statute, its\nholding is still applicable here. Cf. Miller, 977 F.2d at 843\n(relying in part on Hall v. Ledex, Inc., 669 F.2d 397 (6th\nCir. 1982) (Title VII and EPA) and Satz v. I.T.T. Fin. Corp.,\n619 F.2d 738 (8th Cir. 1990) (Title VII)). Finally, there are\nnumerous cases in other circuits that have followed the\nBazemore decision to hold that in a Title VII case claiming\ndiscriminatory pay, the receipt of each paycheck is a\ncontinuing violation. See, e.g., Anderson v. Zubieta, 180\nF.3d 329, 335-37 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Ashley v. Boyle's\nFamous Corned Beef Co., 66 F.3d 164, 167-68 (8th Cir.\n1995) (en banc); Brinkley-Obu, 36 F.3d at 345-51.\n\nThe defendants seek to uphold the summary judgment\non the disparate pay claim on the ground that the\nundisputed facts show that any difference in pay between\nthe employees in the ISD unit who also had the title of\nproject manager \"was a result of the varying degrees of\nseniority, experience, education and difference in job\nresponsibilities.\" Br. of Appellees at 19. It may, indeed, be\ntrue that whatever differences existed were the result of\n\n                               9\n\ffactors other than ethnicity and that the failure to promote\nCardenas to a level that he claims would have been\nconsistent with his responsibilities may have been due to\nhis failure to request and/or merit promotion. However,\nbecause the District Court disposed of the disparate pay\nclaim on the basis of the statute of limitations rather than\nany merits factor, we cannot reach those issues but will\nleave them to the District Court on remand.3\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we will reverse the\nDistrict Court's order granting summary judgment for\ndefendants on Cardenas' disparate pay claims and remand\nthe case for a determination on the merits.\n\nIV.\n\nCardenas contends he became subject to a hostile work\nenvironment after Jon Massey became his immediate\nsupervisor on March 7, 1991 pursuant to an ISD\nreorganization. According to Cardenas, Massey subjected\nhim to ethnic slurs and comments, beginning with their\ninitial interview and continuing through 1994. Among other\nthings, Massey allegedly called Cardenas the \"boy from the\nbarrio,\" app. at 1185, asked Cardenas why he had\nanglicized his name, and regularly dealt with professional\ndisagreements by questioning whether Cardenas intended\nto pull out a switchblade. Until 1993, Cardenas also found\nderogatory anonymous messages on the marker board in\nhis cubicle, which he believes Massey wrote. The most\noffensive message used the word \"mojado,\" which means\n\"wetback.\" App. at 895, 1189.\n\nHe further contends that Massey discriminated against\nhim in completing performance evaluations.4 Regarding\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Nor do we decide whether the initial decision to hire Cardenas at a\nlevel 30 was due to ethnicity or, as defendants argue, the policy or\npractice not to hire any new hire at level 32. We will give the District\nCourt the opportunity to decide in the first instance whether it is a\nseparate claim or survives the statute of limitations bar because it is\ninextricably bound to the disparate pay claim.\n\n4. The AOC performance evaluations consist of ten component ratings\nand an overall rating. The component categories are: (1) knowledge of\n\n                                10\n\fMassey's disparate performance evaluations, Cardenas has\nprovided evidence that appears to show that Massey\nregularly rounded up the component ratings when\ndetermining the overall scores of non Hispanic subordinates\nbut rounded down when calculating ratings of Cardenas,\nsometimes to the point of rating Cardenas lower overall\nthan white employees with lower component ratings. 5\nCardenas contends that Rebo also discriminated against\nhim, though more subtly than Massey. For example, he\npoints out that Rebo assigned minorities and trainees\ndisproportionately to his unit and claims that Rebo\ntarnished his reputation by spreading the word that he was\nan affirmative-action hire. He further notes that Rebo\nreviewed each of Massey's performance evaluations (of\nCardenas and of Massey's other subordinates) before they\nwere issued, and had the authority to change the ratings.\nApp. at 971-73.\n\nFinally, Cardenas asserts Rebo and Massey collectively\nimpeded his job performance through other facially neutral\nmanagement devices, such as knowingly contradictory\ninstructions and assignments incompatible with his staff\nresources. He claims that Massey insisted Cardenas obey\nhim even when he contradicted Rebo and did not defend\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwork, (2) attendance history, (3) quantity of work, (4) quality of work,\n(5)\nplanning and organization, (6) initiative, (7) mental ability, (8)\nanalytical\nability and judgment, (9) leadership, and (10) development of personnel.\nThe evaluator gives the employee one of five rankings (unsatisfactory,\nmarginal, satisfactory, commendable, and outstanding/superior) for each\ncategory and an overall rating. See, e.g., App. at 206-13.\n\n5. Cardenas assigned each rating a number, from 0 to 4, then calculated\nhis \"GPA\" from the ratings in the component categories, which he then\ncompared to the overall ratings. Massey gave Cardenas an overall rating\nof \"satisfactory\" or \"2\" for GPAs of 2.5, 2.4, and 2.6, and an overall\nrating of \"marginal\" or \"1\" for a GPA of 1.7. App. at 474-505. By\ncontrast, Massey gave other subordinates overall ratings of\n\"commendable\" or \"3\" for GPAs of 2.4, 2.55, 2.6, and 2.6, and a\n\"satisfactory +\" or \"2.5\" for a GPA of 2.2. App. at 896-935. Notably,\nCardenas himself received an overall rating of \"commendable\" or \"3\" for\na GPA of 2.6 in an evaluation he received from his previous supervisor.\nApp. at 216-23. We express no opinion on the accuracy of Cardenas'\nrating system, an issue for the trier of fact.\n\n                               11\n\fCardenas when his express directives got Cardenas into\ntrouble.\n\nCardenas claims that he complained to Massey, Rebo,\nLipscher, Bobby Battle (the AOC's Equal Employment\nOpportunity (\"EEO\") Officer), and Human Resources\npersonnel about Massey's harassment to no avail. He\nasserts that Battle refused to address the problem\ninformally and that the harassment continued unabated\nuntil Cardenas submitted a formal complaint on December\n30, 1994, which he had been reluctant to do for fear of\nretaliation. Defendants emphasize that Cardenas made no\nallegations of specific discrimination to anyone in the AOC\nuntil the summer of 1994, and that many of his complaints\nwere non-specific or accompanied by requests that the\nparticular incident be treated as minor or that he be left to\ndeal with the problem on his own to avoid reprisals.\n\nThe failure to complain to higher management did not\ndefeat plaintiffs' Title VII claims in Faragher v. Boca Raton,\n524 U.S. 775, 782 (1998), or Burlington Industries, Inc. v.\nEllerth, 524 U.S. 742, 748-49 (1998), and we see no reason\nwhy the failure to file a formal complaint would defeat\nCardenas' claim here. As noted, he did subsequently file a\ncomplaint pursuant to the AOC procedures. Thus, at most,\nif Cardenas sent a mixed message, it would be an issue\ngoing to his credibility as to the severity of the harassment.\n\nCardenas did not complete providing detailed allegations\nfor his EEO complaint until March 1995. On March 3,\n1995, the AOC rejected his request that he and his entire\nunit be transferred out of the ISD immediately, but offered\nhim three temporary alternative work assignments for the\npendency of the EEO investigation. Cardenas asserts that\nthe options were unacceptable because they either left him\nunder Rebo's or Massey's supervision or demoted him by\nremoving his management responsibilities. Moreover,\nCardenas claims that when he nonetheless professed\ninterest in one option, his efforts to accept it were\nstonewalled. On April 6, 1995, he filed a charge with the\nEEOC.\n\nCardenas contends that the internal EEO investigation\nwas overly long, pointing out that the investigators did not\n\n                               12\n\fsend charges to Rebo and Massey until June 1995, and\nthen granted their request for an extension to respond. The\nEEO did not issue a report until October 30, 1995.\nCardenas received a copy of the report in November 1995.\nHe argues that the report's conclusion finding \"no evidence\nof discrimination,\" App. at 285, is unfounded. He also notes\nthat the investigation did not address his disparate pay\nclaim.\n\nCardenas has also asserted a claim of retaliation which\nhe attributes to his engaging in three protected activities in\n1994 and 1995 known to Massey and Rebo. He supported\na subordinate's sexual harassment allegations against Rebo\nin June 1994, filed a formal discrimination complaint\nagainst Massey and Rebo with the AOC's EEO that\nDecember, and offered to support a lateral job applicant's\nEEO complaint against Massey in January 1995. Cardenas\nclaims to have suffered retaliation from Rebo and Massey\nfor his protected activities. He cites, for example, an\nallegedly undeservedly low performance evaluation in\nAugust 1994, a threat of discipline which sent him to the\nhospital with stress-induced chest pains, increased\npersonnel disruptions in his unit, and an unusual\nsummons to the human resources department which\nprovoked a second stress attack severe enough to warrant\na second hospital visit.\n\nIn November 1995, allegedly realizing he could not\nsalvage his job, Cardenas began looking for new\nemployment. He left the AOC on March 1, 1996, and\nreceived his \"right-to-sue\" letter from the EEOC on May 28,\n1996.\n\nA hostile work environment, first recognized by the\nSupreme Court as a basis for a discrimination claim under\nTitle VII in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinsen , 477 U.S.\n57, 65-68 (1986), in a case claiming sexual harassment, is\nnow established as a basis for various discrimination\nclaims. See Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 786-87\n(1998) (discussing the Court's \"repeated\" clarifications of\nthe foundations of hostile work environment claims). In\norder to establish a hostile work environment claim under\nTitle VII, Cardenas must show that (1) he suffered\nintentional discrimination because of his national origin; (2)\n\n                               13\n\fthe discrimination was pervasive and regular; (3) it\ndetrimentally affected him; (4) it would have detrimentally\naffected a reasonable person of the same protected class in\nhis position; and (5) there is a basis for vicarious liability.\nSee Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074,\n1081 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\nIn considering whether Cardenas has established the\nelements of a hostile work environment claim, the record\nmust be evaluated as a whole to decide whether the\nplaintiff has proved his or her case, because \"[p]articularly\nin the discrimination area, it is often difficult to determine\nthe motivations of an action and any analysis is filled with\npitfalls and ambiguities. . . . [A] discrimination analysis\nmust concentrate not on individual incidents, but on the\noverall scenario.\" Durham Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 166 F.3d\n139, 149 (3d Cir. 1999) (quotations omitted); see also\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)\n(\"Whether an environment is `hostile' . . . can be determined\nonly by looking at all the circumstances.\"). Title VII applies\nto both \"facially neutral mistreatment . . .[and] overt\n[ethnic] discrimination . . . [which] in sum constitute[ ] the\nhostile work environment.\" Id. at 148; 6 see also Aman, 85\nF.3d at 1081-84 (discussing the increased sophistication of\nmodern violators, the obligation of courts to be\n\"increasingly vigilant\" against subtle forms of\ndiscrimination, and the importance of allowing plaintiffs to\nprove discrimination indirectly: \"[i]n light of the suspicious\nremarks [arguably racial slurs] . . . , a reasonable jury\ncould interpret [facially neutral] behavior[such as stolen\ntime cards] as part of a complex tapestry of\ndiscrimination\").\n\nThe District Court accepted that Massey's alleged\nremarks and the anonymous marker-board messages\nsatisfied the causation element of the hostile work\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We draw here on standards developed in sexual harassment cases. As\nthe Supreme Court observed in Faragher,\"[a]lthough racial and sexual\nharassment will often take different forms, and standards may not be\nentirely interchangeable, we think there is good sense in seeking\ngenerally to harmonize the standards of what amounts to actionable\nharassment.\" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787 (1998).\n\n                               14\n\fenvironment claims but noted that \"some of the other\nallegedly hostile actions taken by the [appellees] were not\novertly ethnically based.\" Dec. 2 opinion at 20. However,\nreviewing the totality of defendants' alleged discriminatory\nconduct as required by Durham, the District Court\nconcluded that Cardenas' \"only factual allegations . . . that\narguably can be considered severe and pervasive instances\nof ethnically hostile conduct are [his] claims regarding\nMassey's disparaging comments about [Cardenas']\nethnicity.\" Id. at 24. The court held that assigning minority\nworkers to a minority manager's unit does not create a\nhostile environment, found that Cardenas \"failed to come\nforward with any evidence . . . indicat[ing] racial hostility\ninfected the [performance] evaluation process,\" id. at 23,\nand found no evidence that Massey and Rebo set Cardenas\nup to fail. Although the District Court agreed that Cardenas\nhad presented evidence of ethnic animus on Massey's part,\nthe court stated that \"a plaintiff cannot prove a case of\nethnic discrimination merely by . . . raising the specter of\ndiscrimination over otherwise legitimate management\ndecisions that may have negatively impacted a minority\nemployee.\" Id. at 24.\n\nWe cannot say that the District Court's evaluation of the\nevidence was not a reasonable one for a trier of fact to\nreach. However, the District Court declined to examine the\npossibility that defendants' \"management decisions\"\nmasked discriminatory intent. As this court has previously\nemphasized, the advent of more sophisticated and subtle\nforms of discrimination requires that we analyze the\naggregate effect of all evidence and reasonable inferences\ntherefrom, including those concerning incidents of facially\nneutral mistreatment, in evaluating a hostile work\nenvironment claim. See Durham, 166 F.3d at 148-49;\nAman, 85 F.3d at 1081-84.\n\nIn addition to the oral and written ethnic slurs cited by\nthe District Court, Cardenas has provided evidence from\nwhich a jury might find ethnic animus underlying other\nostensibly nondiscriminatory incidents. For example,\ndisproportionate assignment of minority employees to the\nonly unit supervised by a minority manager might create an\nimpression of, or be motivated by an intent to achieve,\n\n                                15\n\fsegregation. Likewise, consistently lower performance\nevaluations for a protected class member as compared to\nnon-protected co-workers may indicate discriminatory\nintent.7\n\nDefendants contest the manner in which Cardenas has\nmade numerical equivalents, but Cardenas' figures create\nan inference strong enough that we cannot disregard the\nevidence for purposes of summary judgment. The AOC's\nevaluation process is subjective and a jury could conclude\nthat Massey, who allegedly subjected Cardenas to\nethnically-charged comments, was motivated by ethnic\nanimus in giving Cardenas lower overall ratings than white\nemployees when Cardenas had higher component ratings.\nSimilarly, a jury could find that Rebo might reasonably\nhave been expected to notice and address this suspect\npattern.\n\nFinally, Cardenas has provided evidence from which a\njury could conclude that Rebo and Massey set him up to\nfail. Cf. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23 (one of many factors which\nmay indicate hostile work environment is \"whether it\nunreasonably interferes with an employee's work\nperformance.\").8 For example, Cardenas testified at his\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. One commentator has written of the effect of similar conduct in sexual\nharassment situations. See Vicki Schultz, Reconceptualizing Sexual\nHarassment, 107 Yale L.J. 1687 (1998) cited with approval in Durham\nLife Ins. Co. v. Evans, 166 F.3d 139, 149 (3d Cir. 1999) (observing that\nsome prevalent forms of sexual harassment include\"denigrating\n[victims'] performance . . . , providing sexist evaluations of [victims']\nperformance or denying them deserved promotions, . .. denying [victims]\nthe perks or privileges that are required for success, . . . [and]\nengaging\nin taunting, pranks, and other forms of hazing designed to remind\n[victims] that they are different and out of place.\").\n\n8. \"To render visible many of the . . . forms of harassment that remain\nhidden, we should also recognize that much of the behavior that creates\na hostile working environment is conduct that has the purpose or effect\nof undermining the perceived or actual competence of[the victim of\ndiscrimination].\" Schultz, supra note 7, at 1762. Indeed, \"there are\ndiverse ways of subverting a [victim's] perceived or actual competence.\nSometimes it takes the form of deliberate sabotage of a [victim's] work\nperformance, such as . . . simply assigning her tasks that are impossible\nto accomplish.\" Id. at 1764. (internal citations omitted).\n\n                               16\n\fdeposition regarding an incident where, pursuant to\nMassey's orders, he curtailed the scope of a presentation\nrequested by Rebo, and was publicly berated by Rebo as a\nresult. App. at 1017-18. If true, this may be analogous to\nincidents referred to in Durham which were included as\nconstituting a hostile workplace. 166 F.3d at 145-46. He\nalso claims that he was given assignments too complicated\nfor his unit, which had a disproportionately high number of\ntrainees, to complete successfully. See id.\n\nThe District Court determined that a jury could conclude\nthat Cardenas' allegations regarding the ethnically\nharassing comments by Massey were severe and pervasive\nenough and would offend a reasonable person, satisfying\nthe elements of the hostile work environment claim as to\nMassey. Feb. 2 op. at 25. However, it found \"a paucity of\ncredible evidence\" showing that the other defendants acted\nin a discriminatory manner based on Cardenas' ethnicity.\nId. at 24. Although Cardenas may not have presented as\nmuch evidence as did plaintiffs in other hostile workplace\nenvironment cases, we cannot conclude that he has not\npresented enough evidence to make a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact. We believe that a jury could determine that\nthis hostile work environment stemmed from several forms\nof facially neutral mistreatment as well as from Massey's\nfacially discriminatory comments.\n\nWe have no reason to believe the result would be any\ndifferent under the LAD. To establish a hostile work\nenvironment claim under the LAD, a plaintiff \"must\ndemonstrate that the defendant's conduct (1) would not\nhave occurred but for the employee's [national origin]; and\n[the conduct] was (2) severe or pervasive enough to make a\n(3) reasonable [person of the same protected class] believe\nthat (4) the conditions of employment are altered and the\nworking environment is hostile or abusive.\" Taylor v.\nMetzger, 152 N.J. 490, 498, 706 A.2d 685, 688-89 (1998)\n(quotations omitted). The elements of this claim closely\nresemble the first four elements of the Title VII hostile work\nenvironment claim. Moreover, like this court, the New\nJersey Supreme Court requires a cumulative analysis of the\nincidents comprising an alleged hostile work environment.\nSee Lehmann v. Toys `R' Us, Inc., 132 N.J. 587, 607, 626\n\n                                17\n\fA.2d 445, 455 (1993). Therefore, our discussion of the Title\nVII claim above applies with equal force to this claim's basic\nelements. We conclude that Cardenas has provided\nsufficient evidence of an actionable hostile work\nenvironment under the LAD to survive summary judgment.\n\nCardenas also claims retaliation as another basis for\nliability. The District Court recognized that to establish a\nprima facie retaliation claim under Title VII,S 1981, or the\nLAD, Cardenas must show: (1) that he engaged in a\nprotected activity; (2) that he suffered an adverse\nemployment action; and (3) that there was a causal\nconnection between the protected activity and the adverse\nemployment action. Dec. 2 opinion at 38; see Robinson v.\nCity of Pittsburgh, 120 F.3d 1286, 1299 (3d Cir. 1997) (Title\nVII); Delli Santi v. CNA Ins. Cos., 88 F.3d 192, 198 (3d Cir.\n1996) (LAD); Khair v. Campbell Soup Co., 893 F. Supp. 316,\n335 (D.N.J. 1995) (S 1981).\n\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for\ndefendants on Cardenas' retaliation claims, finding that\nCardenas had not shown that he engaged in a protected\nactivity or, assuming Cardenas suffered an adverse\nemployment action, any causal relationship between that\nactivity and the actions that were allegedly retaliatory. Dec.\n2 op. at 39. We are satisfied that Cardenas has pointed to\nevidence that he engaged in three protected activities\nbetween June 1994 and January 1995 in the form of his\nown discrimination complaint and his cooperation in the\ncomplaints of two other individuals.\n\nIn Robinson, we stated that an adverse employment\naction is one which is \"serious and tangible enough to alter\nan employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment.\" See 120 F.3d at 1300. Cardenas\nclaims that his resignation was a constructive discharge,\nwhich we will assume arguendo would constitute an\nadverse employment action. \"In order to establish a\nconstructive discharge, a plaintiff must show that the\nemployer knowingly permitted conditions of discrimination\nin employment so intolerable that a reasonable person\nsubject to them would resign.\" Aman, 85 F.3d at 1084\n(quotations omitted). A \"continuous pattern of\ndiscriminatory treatment over a period of years\" may\n\n                               18\n\fconstitute \"intolerable\" conditions even without a particular\negregious precipitating incident. Id. (\"The fact that Aman\nhad been subject to continuous discrimination during her\nemployment could support a conclusion that she simply\nhad had enough. No other precipitating facts were legally\nrequired.\").\n\nThe District Court was willing to assume for purposes of\nsummary judgment that Cardenas suffered a constructive\ndischarge but found missing evidence of any causal link to\nany of the alleged protected activity. As to the poor\nperformance evaluation, which Cardenas also cites here as\nretaliatory, the District Court concluded that Cardenas\nfailed to show that the improper performance evaluation\nwas causally related to Cardenas' engaging in any protected\nactivity. Dec. 2 opinion at 40.\n\nWe are, of course, cognizant of our obligation to view the\nrecord and submissions of the parties so that we may draw\nall reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\nAs is evident from the foregoing, we have been able to find\nenough evidence to show the existence of a genuine issue\nof material fact as to the existence of a hostile work\nenvironment. We have been unable to find any such issue\nwith respect to the required causal element in Cardenas'\nretaliation claim. He contends that the evaluation that\nrated the work he performed through August 1995 as\n\"marginal,\" the lowest he ever received, was not presented\nto him until after the completion of the EEO report. There\nhave been cases in which the temporal relation between an\nadverse employment action and the protected activity has\nenabled the court to draw the inference of causal\nrelationship. See, e.g., Jalil v. Advel Corp., 873 F.2d 701,\n708 (3d Cir. 1989) (inferring causation when discharge\noccurred two days after employer's notice of plaintiff 's\nEEOC complaint). However, \"temporal proximity alone will\nbe insufficient to establish the necessary causal connection\nwhen the temporal relationship is not `unusually\nsuggestive.' \" Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d\n271, 280 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Krouse v. American\nSterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 503 (3d Cir. 1997)). The\ntemporal relationship in this case is, alone, insufficient to\nestablish causation, because the alleged protected activity\n\n                               19\n\ftook place over a substantial period of time and any routine\nemployment action taken during that period would\nnecessarily be related temporally. In such circumstances,\nthere would have to be another basis to permit the\ninference of a causal relationship.\n\nAlthough we have held that many of the employment\nactions to which Cardenas points as retaliatory were part of\nthe fabric of incidents from which a factfinder could\nconclude made for a hostile work environment, it was\nMassey's overt ethnic hostility that formed the thread\nbetween the employment actions and the alleged hostile\nenvironment. There is no similar basis to form a thread\nbetween the same otherwise routine employment actions\nand the protected activity. Our finding such a thread would\nbe sheer speculation. Under that circumstance, we will\naffirm the judgment of the District Court granting\ndefendants summary judgment on Cardenas' retaliation\nclaim.\n\nV.\n\nHaving determined that the District Court's dismissal of\nCardenas' claim for disparate pay on the basis of the\nstatute of limitations was erroneous as a matter of law and\nthat its grant of summary judgment for the defendants on\nliability for a hostile workplace cannot be sustained, we\nmust decide which claim survives as to which defendant.\nInasmuch as Cardenas settled with Massey, the defendant\nwith the most direct culpability, we consider only the\nclaims against the other defendants.\n\nThe District Court, having dismissed the disparate pay\nclaims, never considered which defendants would be liable\nif Cardenas were to prevail on the merits of that claim. Dec.\n2 opinion at 17. We believe it appropriate for the District\nCourt to consider that issue in the first instance. We\ntherefore limit our consideration to the question of liability\non the hostile work environment claim. Of course, if\nCardenas does not prevail, there would be no reason to\nconsider relief as to any of the defendants. Nonetheless, we\nproceed to consider whether there are other grounds to\naffirm the District Court's dismissals as to each defendant\nat this stage.\n\n                               20\n\fCardenas seeks only equitable relief from Chief Justice\nPoritz and Ciancia. He seeks an injunction requiring them\nto implement specific anti-discrimination policies at the\nAOC and alter his employment records retroactively to\nreflect, contrary to fact, a higher pay-grade classification\nand more favorable performance evaluations. In support of\nhis position, Cardenas cites authority for the proposition\nthat Title VII, S 1981, and the LAD all provide for equitable\nrelief, see 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-5(g)(1) (Title VII); Johnson v.\nRailway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 460 (1975)\n(S 1981); Shaner v. Horizon Bancorp., 116 N.J. 433, 441,\n561 A.2d 1130 (1989) (LAD), and contends that he\"cannot\nobtain the whole remedy that Title VII specifically promises\nand that is implicit in S 1981 and the LAD\" without the\nequitable relief he seeks, Br. for Appellant at 62.\n\nBecause Cardenas is no longer employed by the AOC, he\nwill not be affected by its implementation of, or failure to\nimplement, new anti-discrimination policies. Therefore, a\nchange in AOC anti-discrimination policies will not make\nhim \"whole\" or remedy violations he contends the\ndefendants committed.9 Regarding Cardenas' novel request\nfor an injunction requiring the AOC to alter his\nperformance evaluations and pay-grade classification to\nreflect not what they actually were but what they would\nhave been without discrimination, he has presented no\nprecedent, nor have we found one, granting equitable relief\nwhich would require a public agency to complete its records\ncounterfactually. We therefore affirm the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment to Ciancia and Poritz regarding\nCardenas' claim for equitable relief.\n\nWe consider next whether there is any basis on which\nCardenas could maintain his claims for a hostile work\nenvironment against the state of New Jersey. The Supreme\nCourt recently reviewed the standard for Title VII employer\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. To the extent he seeks relief for perceived ongoing discrimination at\nthe AOC against current employees, he has presented no evidence of\nsuch discrimination and cannot in any case assert the rights of the\nemployees. See O'Malley v. Brierley, 477 F.2d 785, 789 (3d Cir. 1973)\n(citing \"the principle that one cannot sue for the deprivation of\nanother's\ncivil rights\") (quotations omitted).\n\n                               21\n\fliability in the context of sexual harassment and clarified\nthat agency principles apply. See Burlington Indus., Inc. v.\nEllerth, 524 U.S. 742 (1998); Faragher v. City of Boca\nRaton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998). An employer is liable for acts\ncommitted by its employees in the scope of their\nemployment, which may include some types of disparate\ntreatment of employees by supervisors, such as\ndiscriminatory reprimands or job assignments. See\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 798-99. Pure harassment (e.g., ethnic\nslurs) is not within the scope of employment and the Court\nsuggested that hostile work environment cases will most\noften properly be analyzed under the rubric of either\nemployer negligence or vicarious liability. See id. at 802-07;\nEllerth, 524 U.S. at 757-59.\n\nThe Court held that employers are subject to vicarious\nliability under Title VII for hostile work environments\ncreated by supervisory employees. However, it also\nenunciated an affirmative defense limiting this liability\nwhen the plaintiff has not suffered a tangible adverse\nemployment action. The defense depends on the\nreasonableness of both the employer's and the plaintiff 's\npreventative and remedial measures. Specifically, the Court\nheld:\n\n       An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a\n       victimized employee for an actionable hostile\n       environment created by a supervisor with immediate\n       (or successively higher) authority over the employee.\n       When no tangible employment action is taken, a\n       defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to\n       liability or damages, subject to proof by a\n       preponderance of the evidence . . . . The defense\n       comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the\n       employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and\n       correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and\n       (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to\n       take advantage of any preventive or corrective\n       opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid\n       harm otherwise. . . . No affirmative defense is available,\n       however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates\n       in a tangible employment action, such as discharge,\n       demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\n\n                               22\n\fEllerth, 524 U.S. at 765; Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807-08.\n\nIn this case, the District Court held that although\nCardenas had made a prima facie case showing a hostile\nwork environment based on Massey's ethnically disparaging\ncomments, the undisputed evidence \"shows that the\ndefendants took reasonable steps to prevent harassment in\nthe workplace, and the plaintiff failed to avail himself of the\nAOC's complaint procedure until December, 1994.\" Dec. 2\nopinion at 34. The court continued, \"[o]nce the plaintiff did\nfile a complaint, the undisputed evidence shows that the\nAOC took immediate, albeit temporary, remedial measures\nwhile it conducted an investigation, and the harassment\nstopped.\" Id.\n\nCardenas does not have to prove at this stage that New\nJersey is liable for a hostile work environment. Instead, he\nneed merely show that there is a genuine issue of material\nfact that it may be held liable for employer liability. If\nCardenas does prove the existence of a hostile work\nenvironment, New Jersey will be liable if (1) Cardenas\nshows that Massey's overt harassment or Rebo's more\nsubtle approach led to a tangible employment action or (2)\none of the two bases for an Ellerth/Faragher affirmative\ndefense as to employer supervisory liability is not available.\nCardenas argues that his resignation from the AOC was in\nfact a constructive discharge which would constitute a\ntangible employment action and preclude New Jersey from\nusing the Ellerth/Faragher defense. 10 If Cardenas convinces\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. \"A tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in\nemployment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote,\nreassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision\ncausing a significant change in benefits.\" Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 761. There\nappears to be some disagreement on whether constructive discharge\nconstitutes a tangible employment action. Compare Caridad v. Metro\nNorth Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 294 (2d Cir. 1999) (stating\n\"constructive discharge does not constitute a`tangible employment\naction' as that term is used in Ellerth and Faragher.\") with Durham Life\nIns. Co. v. Evans, 166 F.3d 139, 153 (3d Cir. 1999) (observing \"[u]nder\n[plaintiff]'s theory, any substantial adverse action . . . would not be a\ntangible adverse employment action if it led the affected employee to quit\nbefore the demotion took effect. This is contrary to Title VII doctrine,\nwhich recognizes a constructive discharge under such circumstances.\")\n\n                               23\n\fa jury that he was victimized by a hostile work environment\ncreated by Massey or Rebo, it is certainly possible that the\nsame jury would find that the hostile environment was\nsevere enough to have precipitated Cardenas' resignation,\ni.e., a constructive discharge. We have found that Cardenas\npresented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact on\nthe existence of a hostile work environment. It follows that\nhe presented enough to survive summary judgment on the\nconstructive discharge issue, and hence New Jersey's\nemployer liability.\n\nEven if the alleged hostile work environment had not\nculminated in a tangible employment action, summary\njudgment for New Jersey based on the Ellerth/Faragher\ndefense, which the District Court found dispositive, would\nbe premature. There are factual issues outstanding as to\nthe reasonableness of the parties' respective actions. As the\nDistrict Court pointed out, Cardenas did delay before filing\na formal EEO complaint and did refuse the alternative\npositions the AOC offered him. On the other hand, he had\ncomplained informally to Rebo, Massey, and Battle, the\nEEO Officer, and Battle refused to address Cardenas'\nconcerns without a formal complaint. In these\ncircumstances, Cardenas' reluctance to file a formal\ncomplaint for fear of aggravating the situation or branding\nhimself a troublemaker might not have been unreasonable.\n\nCardenas argues that the AOC's published anti-\ndiscrimination policy and complaint procedure, on which\nthe District Court relied, was insufficient to satisfy\nEllerth/Faragher for a number of reasons. Cardenas asserts\nthat the investigators declined to re-interview him when he\ninsisted that his lawyer be present but instead adopted\nMassey's explanation of the alleged ethnic slurs; the report\nwas issued seven months after he submitted his detailed\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nand Cherry v. Menard Inc., 101 F.Supp.2d 1160, 1171 (W.D. Iowa 2000)\n(\"This court, however, does not agree with the decisions reached in\nCaridad.\").\n\nWe leave this issue to the District Court in the first instance. For\npurposes of this discussion, we assume a constructive discharge is a\ntangible employment action.\n\n                               24\n\fdiscrimination allegations (ten months after his initial,\nformal complaint) and during that period he remained\nunder the supervision of Massey and Rebo, allegedly\nsubject to continuing discrimination; the AOC allegedly did\nnot respond to his e-mail asking for protection against\nongoing retaliation; the alternative positions offered to\nCardenas pending the investigation purportedly either left\nhim under the supervision of Rebo or Massey or effectively\ndemoted him by eliminating or significantly decreasing his\nmanagerial duties, and his effort to find out more about,\nand possibly accept, one of the positions was stonewalled;\nand the internal investigation failed to address his\ndisparate pay claim and concluded that there was no\ndiscrimination and therefore offered him no relief.\nInasmuch as we cannot rule out a genuine issue of material\nfact with respect to whether the Ellerth/Faragher\naffirmative defense would be available to New Jersey, we\ncannot sustain the grant of summary judgment on the Title\nVII claim as to New Jersey.\n\nSimilarly, New Jersey may be liable under its own LAD.\nUnder New Jersey's LAD, employers are liable under\ntraditional agency principles. See, e.g., Rudolph v. Adamar\nof N.J., Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10902, *39 (D.N.J. July\n31, 2001) (\"Suits brought against the State as an employer\nare clearly within the scope of the explicit waiver of\nsovereign immunity contained in [the LAD]\"); Newsome v.\nAdministrative Office of Courts, 103 F.Supp.2d 807, 821\n(D.N.J. 2000) (\"As with Title VII, under the LAD, traditional\nagency principles govern the extent to which the[employer]\nmay be liable for compensatory damages for [a supervisor's]\nactions. When a supervisor . . . , acting within the scope of\nhis employment, harasses an employee under his\nsupervision, the employer is vicariously liable.\").\n\nIt remains to consider whether there is a basis also to\nretain as defendants the two remaining named individuals,\nRebo and Lipscher. Although claims against individual\nsupervisors are not permitted under Title VII, see, e.g.,\nSheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., 100 F.3d\n1061, 1077-78 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc), this court has\nfound individual liability under S 1981 \"when [the\ndefendants] intentionally cause an infringement of rights\n\n                               25\n\fprotected by Section 1981, regardless of whether the\n[employer] may also be held liable.\" See Al-Khazraji v. Saint\nFrancis Coll., 784 F.2d 505, 518 (3d Cir. 1986); see also\nSantiago v. City of Vineland, 107 F.Supp.2d 512, 540-41\n(D.N.J. 2000). In Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S.\n701 (1989), the Supreme Court held S 1983 provides the\n\" `exclusive federal damages remedy for the violation of the\nrights guaranteed by S 1981 when the claim is pressed\nagainst a state actor.' \" Following Jett , Congress passed the\nCivil Rights Act of 1991 which amended S 1981 to provide\nthat \"rights protected by this section are protected against\nimpairment by nongovernmental discrimination and\nimpairment under color of State law.\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 1981(c)(1994). As a district court has noted, \"[f]ederal\ncourts have disagreed whether S 1981(c) abrogates Jett by\ncreating an implied independent cause of action.\" Meachum\nv. Temple Univ., 42 F.Supp.2d 533, 541 n.9. (E.D. Pa.\n1999); see also Jones v. School Dist., 198 F.3d 403, 414-15\n(3d Cir. 1999); Santiago, 107 F.Supp.2d at 540 n.17 (D.N.J.\n2000) (suggesting it is an open question in this circuit\nwhether S 1981 claims are available against state actors).\n\nUnder the LAD a supervisory employee may be liable for\ndiscrimination for aiding and abetting another's (the\nemployer's) violation. See Hurley, 174 F.3d at 126; see also\nFailla v. City of Passaic, 146 F.3d 149, 158 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(\"[A] person is liable for harm resulting to a third person\nfrom the conduct of another when he knows that the\nother's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives\nsubstantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to\nconduct himself.\") (quotation omitted). Moreover, a\nsupervisor has a duty under New Jersey law to act against\nharassment, and a supervisor's violation of this duty by\neither deliberate indifference or affirmative harassment\nsubjects the supervisor to LAD liability. Hurley , 174 F.3d at\n128 (citing New Jersey cases); see also id. at 126 (failure to\nact may qualify as aiding and abetting when it rises to the\nlevel of \"substantial assistance or encouragement.\")\n(quotation omitted).\n\nWe need not reach that issue as to Lipscher because the\nonly evidence implicating Lipscher in discriminatory\nactivities is his ultimate responsibility for the investigation\n\n                               26\n\fas the AOC Director. There is no evidence suggesting that\nhe was aware of, but ignored, Cardenas' cries for help or\ndefects in the investigation. There is no evidence that\nLipscher discriminated against Cardenas or was\ndeliberately indifferent to the discrimination he suffered.\nThe evidence indicates that Lipscher had little contact with\nCardenas and that he did not make the type of daily\nmanagerial decisions Cardenas claims masked Massey's\nand Rebo's discriminatory intent. There is no evidence that\nLipscher had any reason to believe Cardenas' direct\nsupervisors were breaching their duty not to discriminate.\nLipscher's acceptance of the investigator's report, which\nCardenas characterizes as a \"whitewash\" and which\nexcused Massey's derogatory comments (or purported to\nexplain why they were not derogatory), does not create a\ngenuine issue as to his discriminatory intent. Cardenas has\nnot presented any evidence that Lipscher had reason to\nbelieve the report was inaccurate, incomplete, or in bad\nfaith. No reasonable jury could find that Lipscher aided or\nabetted any discrimination against Cardenas. The evidence\nshows that Lipscher took Cardenas' complaint seriously,\nassigned an investigator to the case, and accepted the\ninvestigator's report. We agree with the District Court that\na reasonable jury could not find any basis for liability as to\nLipscher, either individually or in his official capacity.\n\nRetention of Rebo is, of course, a different matter. The\nmajority of the behavior which Cardenas found offensive\nwas perpetrated by either Rebo or Massey. Whether Rebo\nwas involved in, or deliberately indifferent to, many of the\nallegedly discriminatory actions contributing to the claimed\nhostile work environment is an issue of fact. For example,\nRebo was allegedly aware of some of Massey's comments\nand conflicting directives to Cardenas but failed to prevent\nthem. He also controlled personnel assignments resulting in\ndisproportionate numbers of both minorities and trainees in\nCardenas' unit, and somehow the fact that Rebo had\nselected Cardenas in part based on his ethnicity became\ncommon knowledge in ISD. Moreover, Rebo failed to\nrecommend Cardenas' reclassification after assigning\nCardenas duties which he had previously used to help\njustify a reclassification for another employee and after\nCardenas' successful negotiations with AT&T. Finally, Rebo\n\n                               27\n\freviewed and approved Massey's allegedly disparate\nperformance reviews of his subordinates. A reasonable jury\ncould conclude from the available evidence that Rebo was\ndeliberately indifferent to, or participated in, Massey's\nalleged harassment of Cardenas. There is sufficient basis to\nraise a question of fact as to Rebo's liability on the basis of\nintentional discrimination under the LAD and under\nS 1981. We will, therefore, reverse the District Court's grant\nof summary judgment to Rebo and remand for further\nproceedings.11\n\nVI.\n\nTo summarize, we will reverse the District Court's order\ngranting summary judgment for defendants on Cardenas'\ndisparate pay claims and remand for a determination on\nthe merits as to those claims; we will reverse the District\nCourt's grant of summary judgment to New Jersey on\nCardenas' claim of a hostile work environment under Title\nVII and the LAD; we will reverse the District Court's grant\nof summary judgment on behalf of Rebo on Cardenas' claim\nof a hostile work environment under S 1981 and the LAD,\nand in all other respects we will affirm the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. We have found it difficult to discern the bases of some of Cardenas'\nclaims. On remand, the District Court may use the procedures available\nunder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require Cardenas to narrow\nand clarify his remaining claims and their evidentiary bases.\n\n                               28\n\f",

Goldstein\n       Washington, D.C. 20507\n\n        Attorney for EEOC\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nSLOVITER, Circuit Judge.\n\nI.\n\nPlaintiff-appellant Gerard Cardenas, a Mexican-American,\nwas hired as of January 29, 1990 as the manager of the\nOffice Systems Unit in the Information Systems Division\n(\"ISD\") of New Jersey's Administrative Office of the Courts\n(\"AOC\") following the retirement of Joseph Ribsam.\nCardenas asserts that through 1989 every manager or\nsupervisor in the ISD was a white non-Hispanic male.\nAppellee James Rebo, head of the ISD, had advertised the\nposition at pay grades G-32 and G-30. Cardenas was\nappointed at the G-30 level. Cardenas resigned on March 1,\n1996. On August 23, 1996, he filed this suit against Jon\nMassey, his immediate supervisor, and Rebo (individually\nand in their official capacities), as well as Robert Lipscher,\nDirector of the AOC (individually), James Ciancia\n(Lipscher's successor, in his official capacity), Deborah\nPoritz (New Jersey's Chief Justice, in her official capacity),\n\n                                  2\n\fand the State of New Jersey. The complaint stated\ndisparate pay, hostile work environment, and retaliation\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. S 1981, 42 U.S.C. S 2000e, et seq.\n(\"Title VII\"), and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination\n(\"LAD\"), N.J. Stat. Ann. S 10:5-1, et seq., and a common law\nclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against\nMassey. Essentially, the claims raised in Cardenas' 128\nparagraph complaint revolve around his contention that he\nwas hired at a lower grade level than merited by the work\nhe was assigned, received disparate pay as a result, was\nnot promoted as merited, was the subject of retaliation, and\nwas subject to a hostile work environment, all as a result\nof his ethnicity.\n\nAfter discovery, the defendants moved for summary\njudgment and Cardenas moved for partial summary\njudgment on his disparate pay claims. The District Court\ngranted defendants' motion, except as to the LAD and\nS 1981 hostile work environment claims against defendant\nMassey, and denied Cardenas' motion by opinion dated\nDecember 2, 1999 (hereafter \"Dec. 2 opinion\"). The court\nsubsequently denied Cardenas' motion for reargument by\nopinion dated February 2, 2000. Cardenas settled his\nclaims against Massey, resolving the remainder of the\naction. He then filed a timely notice of appeal as to the\nremaining defendants. On appeal, the EEOC has filed an\namicus curiae brief solely as to the issue of the proper\napplication of the statute of limitations to disparate pay\nclaims.\n\nThe District Court had jurisdiction over this action under\n28 U.S.C. SS 1331, 1343, 1367. This court has appellate\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nII.\n\nCardenas has set forth a litany of incidents from his six\nyears employment at the AOC that he contends show\ndiscrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment.\nOur review of the grant of summary judgment is plenary.\nSee Wheeler v.

In Anderson , the Court\nexplained that the judge's role when adjudicating a motion\nfor summary judgment \"is not himself to weigh the evidence\nand determine the truth of the matter but to determine\nwhether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Id. at 249. In\nmaking this determination, a court is to draw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the non-moving party. See Berner Int'l\nCorp. v.

Cardenas contends\nthat he performed all of the responsibilities of his\npredecessor, who was Chief, Office Services Systems, a G-\n31, and came to assume additional ones (the \"PC/LAN\nduties\"). He contends that Richard Chelenza, another mid-\nlevel ISD manager, previously had the PC/LAN duties and,\nas a result, Chelenza's pay grade had been raised from G-\n31 to G-33 at Rebo's request. He claims he resolved LAN\nproblems caused by inadequate materials supplied to the\nAOC by AT&T, negotiating a deal with the company\nwhereby it replaced over $400,000 of defective materials\nand yet he remained at pay level G-30, the grade he held\nthroughout his six-year tenure at the AOC.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. After June 1994, all AOC managers' salaries were frozen. It is not\nclear whether the freeze applied to promotions.\n\n                               4\n\fThe District Court recognized that Cardenas asserted\nthree legal bases for his wage discrimination claim--\nS 1981, LAD, and Title VII, and that a separate limitations\nperiod applies to each. Cardenas' S 1981 claims are subject\nto a two-year statute of limitations. See Goodman v. Lukens\nSteel Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111926\"><a href=\"/opinion/111926/goodman-v-lukens-steel-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 662 (1987); N.J.

A two-year statute of limitations also applies to\nLAD claims whose \"operative facts\" occurred after July 27,\n1993, whereas LAD claims based on events occurring\nbefore this date are subject to a six-year statute of\nlimitations. See Martinez v. Nat'l Broadcasting Co., 877 F.\nSupp. 219, 230 (D.N.J. 1994); Montells v.

S 2000e-5(f)(1). The District Court calculated that to\nmaintain an action for disparate pay based on his pay\ngrade under Title VII, Cardenas had to file a complaint with\nthe EEOC on or before July 29, 19902; to maintain a S 1981\naction, he had to file his complaint in the district court on\nor before January 29, 1992; and to maintain an action\nunder LAD, he had to file his complaint in the district court\non or before January 29, 1996.\n\nThe District Court found that because Cardenas'\ndisparate pay claims stem from his initial pay grade\nclassification, they accrued when he began working at the\nAOC on January 29, 1990, and are therefore time-barred.\nIt rejected Cardenas' argument that each paycheck he\nreceived over the course of his AOC employment, which\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The court incorrectly believed that under Title VII Cardenas' claims\nhad to be presented to the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged unlawful\nemployment practice. In fact, because New Jersey has an anti-\ndiscrimination law, a claim must be presented to the EEOC within 300\ndays of the alleged unlawful employment practice.

In Evans, the discrimination, which was forcing\nplaintiff to resign when she married, occurred outside the\nstatutory period. Although she was rehired within the\nstatutory period, her seniority was calculated from the date\nof her re-hire. The Supreme Court rejected plaintiff 's\nargument that this application of the seniority system\nconstituted a continuing violation because it gave present\neffect to the employer's past discriminatory act by\ndisregarding the seniority she had accrued before her\nforced resignation. The Court held that no present violation\nexisted because the seniority system, its adoption, and its\noperation were nondiscriminatory. See Evans, 431 U.S. at\n557-60.\n\nIn Ricks, the employer College denied the plaintiff\nprofessor tenure and gave him a \"terminal\" one-year\ncontract pursuant to College policy. The tenure denial was\noutside the statutory period, but plaintiff 's final day of\nemployment was not, and he argued that his discharge was\na continuing violation. The Court disagreed, finding that it\nwas \"a delayed, but inevitable, consequence of the denial of\ntenure. In order for the limitations periods to commence\nwith the date of discharge, Ricks would have had to allege\nand prove that the manner in which his employment was\nterminated differed discriminatorily from the manner in\nwhich the College terminated other professors who also had\n\n                               6\n\fbeen denied tenure.\" Ricks, 449 U.S. at 257-58. The Court\ncited Evans for the proposition that we look not for\ncontinuing effects but for present acts of discrimination. Id.\n\nIn Lorance, the plaintiffs were demoted under a facially\nneutral seniority system, operated in a non-discriminatory\nmanner but allegedly adopted with a discriminatory\npurpose outside the statutory period. The Court, citing\nEvans, Ricks, and the special status of seniority systems in\ndiscrimination law, Lorance, 490 U.S. at 911-12, declined\nto apply the continuing violations doctrine, holding that\n\"[b]ecause the claimed invalidity of the . . . seniority system\nis wholly dependent on the alleged illegality of signing the\nunderlying [collective bargaining] agreement, it is the date\nof that signing which governs the limitations period.\" Id. at\n911.\n\nIn all three cases, the Supreme Court held there was no\ncontinuing violation where the effects of prior\ndiscriminatory acts, but no actual discrimination, occurred\nwithin the limitations period. The Evans-Ricks-Lorance line\nof cases bars claims where the relevant aspect of the\nemployment system (such as promotion, seniority, or\ntermination) is facially neutral, and any discrete\ndiscriminatory conduct took place and ceased outside the\nperiod of limitations. As the Lorance Court observed, \"[w]ith\na facially neutral system the discriminatory act occurs only\nat the time of adoption, for each application is\nnondiscriminatory.\" Id. at 912 n.5. However, this line of\ncases does not bar claims based on conduct which is\nalleged to have \"continued to discriminate unlawfully each\ntime it was applied.\" Anderson v.

A\nmore pertinent Supreme Court decision is Bazemore v.\nFriday, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111746\"><a href=\"/opinion/111746/bazemore-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), where the Court reversed the\ndismissal of a Title VII disparate pay claim on statute of\nlimitations grounds and held that each of plaintiffs' pay\nchecks constituted a distinct violation of their right to\nnondiscriminatory compensation. The Court stated that the\n\n                               7\n\flimitations defense could not be based on the ground that\nthe disparities stemmed from discriminatory policies pre-\ndating the effective date of Title VII, explaining:\n\n       that the [employer] discriminated with respect to\n       salaries prior to the time it was covered by Title VII\n       does not excuse perpetuating that discrimination after\n       [it] became covered by Title VII. . . . A pattern or\n       practice that would have constituted a violation of Title\n       VII, but for the fact that the statute had not yet\n       become effective, became a violation upon Title VII's\n       effective date, and to the extent an employer continued\n       to engage in that act or practice, it is liable under that\n       statute. . . . Each week's paycheck that delivers less to\n       a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong\n       actionable under Title VII, regardless of the fact that this\n       pattern was begun prior to the effective date of Title VII.\n\nBazemore, 478 U.S. at 395-96 (third emphasis added)\n(Brennan, J., concurring in part, joined by all members of\nthe Court).\n\nThereafter, in Miller v.

In fact,\"[m]ost\ncourts appear to treat pay discrimination claims as\ncontinuing violations.\" Miller, 977 F.2d at 843. Certainly, in\nthis circuit, \" `discriminatory wage payments constitute a\ncontinuing violation. . . .

The EEOC states that \"both Bazemore and Miller\ncontemplate that an individual may challenge allegedly\ndiscriminatory wage payments so long as one such\npayment falls within the limitations period.\" Br. of EEOC at\n\n                                8\n\f14. It further states that \"Cardenas received allegedly\ndiscriminatory paychecks within 300 days prior to the filing\nof his administrative charge, and so his claim should have\nbeen deemed timely.\" Id. at 10. The EEOC argues that if the\nDistrict Court's opinion is allowed to stand, it\"would\nfrustrate enforcement of Title VII by improperly insulating\ncurrent discriminatory conduct from challenge under the\nstatute.\" Id. at 1.\n\nIn its opinion on Cardenas' request for reargument, the\nDistrict Court rejected Cardenas' argument that it had\noverlooked the Miller decision. The court first noted that\nCardenas had not cited Miller and then held that Miller was\nnot controlling because it analyzed the statute of limitations\nunder the Equal Pay Act whereas Cardenas sued under\nTitle VII. However, the Supreme Court's opinion in\nBazemore concerns a Title VII claim. Moreover, application\nof the continuing violations doctrine is not dependent on\nwhich statute gives rise to the plaintiff 's claim. See\nBrinkley-Obu v.

It may, indeed, be\ntrue that whatever differences existed were the result of\n\n                               9\n\ffactors other than ethnicity and that the failure to promote\nCardenas to a level that he claims would have been\nconsistent with his responsibilities may have been due to\nhis failure to request and/or merit promotion. However,\nbecause the District Court disposed of the disparate pay\nclaim on the basis of the statute of limitations rather than\nany merits factor, we cannot reach those issues but will\nleave them to the District Court on remand.3\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we will reverse the\nDistrict Court's order granting summary judgment for\ndefendants on Cardenas' disparate pay claims and remand\nthe case for a determination on the merits.\n\nIV.\n\nCardenas contends he became subject to a hostile work\nenvironment after Jon Massey became his immediate\nsupervisor on March 7, 1991 pursuant to an ISD\nreorganization. According to Cardenas, Massey subjected\nhim to ethnic slurs and comments, beginning with their\ninitial interview and continuing through 1994. Among other\nthings, Massey allegedly called Cardenas the \"boy from the\nbarrio,\" app. at 1185, asked Cardenas why he had\nanglicized his name, and regularly dealt with professional\ndisagreements by questioning whether Cardenas intended\nto pull out a switchblade. Until 1993, Cardenas also found\nderogatory anonymous messages on the marker board in\nhis cubicle, which he believes Massey wrote. The most\noffensive message used the word \"mojado,\" which means\n\"wetback.\" App. at 895, 1189.\n\nHe further contends that Massey discriminated against\nhim in completing performance evaluations.4 Regarding\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Nor do we decide whether the initial decision to hire Cardenas at a\nlevel 30 was due to ethnicity or, as defendants argue, the policy or\npractice not to hire any new hire at level 32. We will give the District\nCourt the opportunity to decide in the first instance whether it is a\nseparate claim or survives the statute of limitations bar because it is\ninextricably bound to the disparate pay claim.\n\n4. The AOC performance evaluations consist of ten component ratings\nand an overall rating. The component categories are: (1) knowledge of\n\n                                10\n\fMassey's disparate performance evaluations, Cardenas has\nprovided evidence that appears to show that Massey\nregularly rounded up the component ratings when\ndetermining the overall scores of non Hispanic subordinates\nbut rounded down when calculating ratings of Cardenas,\nsometimes to the point of rating Cardenas lower overall\nthan white employees with lower component ratings. 5\nCardenas contends that Rebo also discriminated against\nhim, though more subtly than Massey. For example, he\npoints out that Rebo assigned minorities and trainees\ndisproportionately to his unit and claims that Rebo\ntarnished his reputation by spreading the word that he was\nan affirmative-action hire. He further notes that Rebo\nreviewed each of Massey's performance evaluations (of\nCardenas and of Massey's other subordinates) before they\nwere issued, and had the authority to change the ratings.\nApp. at 971-73.\n\nFinally, Cardenas asserts Rebo and Massey collectively\nimpeded his job performance through other facially neutral\nmanagement devices, such as knowingly contradictory\ninstructions and assignments incompatible with his staff\nresources. He claims that Massey insisted Cardenas obey\nhim even when he contradicted Rebo and did not defend\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwork, (2) attendance history, (3) quantity of work, (4) quality of work,\n(5)\nplanning and organization, (6) initiative, (7) mental ability, (8)\nanalytical\nability and judgment, (9) leadership, and (10) development of personnel.\nThe evaluator gives the employee one of five rankings (unsatisfactory,\nmarginal, satisfactory, commendable, and outstanding/superior) for each\ncategory and an overall rating. See, e.g., App. at 206-13.\n\n5. Cardenas assigned each rating a number, from 0 to 4, then calculated\nhis \"GPA\" from the ratings in the component categories, which he then\ncompared to the overall ratings. Massey gave Cardenas an overall rating\nof \"satisfactory\" or \"2\" for GPAs of 2.5, 2.4, and 2.6, and an overall\nrating of \"marginal\" or \"1\" for a GPA of 1.7. App. at 474-505. By\ncontrast, Massey gave other subordinates overall ratings of\n\"commendable\" or \"3\" for GPAs of 2.4, 2.55, 2.6, and 2.6, and a\n\"satisfactory +\" or \"2.5\" for a GPA of 2.2. App. at 896-935. Notably,\nCardenas himself received an overall rating of \"commendable\" or \"3\" for\na GPA of 2.6 in an evaluation he received from his previous supervisor.\nApp. at 216-23. We express no opinion on the accuracy of Cardenas'\nrating system, an issue for the trier of fact.\n\n                               11\n\fCardenas when his express directives got Cardenas into\ntrouble.\n\nCardenas claims that he complained to Massey, Rebo,\nLipscher, Bobby Battle (the AOC's Equal Employment\nOpportunity (\"EEO\") Officer), and Human Resources\npersonnel about Massey's harassment to no avail. He\nasserts that Battle refused to address the problem\ninformally and that the harassment continued unabated\nuntil Cardenas submitted a formal complaint on December\n30, 1994, which he had been reluctant to do for fear of\nretaliation. Defendants emphasize that Cardenas made no\nallegations of specific discrimination to anyone in the AOC\nuntil the summer of 1994, and that many of his complaints\nwere non-specific or accompanied by requests that the\nparticular incident be treated as minor or that he be left to\ndeal with the problem on his own to avoid reprisals.\n\nThe failure to complain to higher management did not\ndefeat plaintiffs' Title VII claims in Faragher v. Boca Raton,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 782 (1998), or Burlington Industries, Inc. v.\nEllerth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 748-49 (1998), and we see no reason\nwhy the failure to file a formal complaint would defeat\nCardenas' claim here. As noted, he did subsequently file a\ncomplaint pursuant to the AOC procedures. Thus, at most,\nif Cardenas sent a mixed message, it would be an issue\ngoing to his credibility as to the severity of the harassment.\n\nCardenas did not complete providing detailed allegations\nfor his EEO complaint until March 1995. On March 3,\n1995, the AOC rejected his request that he and his entire\nunit be transferred out of the ISD immediately, but offered\nhim three temporary alternative work assignments for the\npendency of the EEO investigation. Cardenas asserts that\nthe options were unacceptable because they either left him\nunder Rebo's or Massey's supervision or demoted him by\nremoving his management responsibilities. Moreover,\nCardenas claims that when he nonetheless professed\ninterest in one option, his efforts to accept it were\nstonewalled. On April 6, 1995, he filed a charge with the\nEEOC.\n\nCardenas contends that the internal EEO investigation\nwas overly long, pointing out that the investigators did not\n\n                               12\n\fsend charges to Rebo and Massey until June 1995, and\nthen granted their request for an extension to respond. The\nEEO did not issue a report until October 30, 1995.\nCardenas received a copy of the report in November 1995.\nHe argues that the report's conclusion finding \"no evidence\nof discrimination,\" App. at 285, is unfounded. He also notes\nthat the investigation did not address his disparate pay\nclaim.\n\nCardenas has also asserted a claim of retaliation which\nhe attributes to his engaging in three protected activities in\n1994 and 1995 known to Massey and Rebo. He supported\na subordinate's sexual harassment allegations against Rebo\nin June 1994, filed a formal discrimination complaint\nagainst Massey and Rebo with the AOC's EEO that\nDecember, and offered to support a lateral job applicant's\nEEO complaint against Massey in January 1995. Cardenas\nclaims to have suffered retaliation from Rebo and Massey\nfor his protected activities. He cites, for example, an\nallegedly undeservedly low performance evaluation in\nAugust 1994, a threat of discipline which sent him to the\nhospital with stress-induced chest pains, increased\npersonnel disruptions in his unit, and an unusual\nsummons to the human resources department which\nprovoked a second stress attack severe enough to warrant\na second hospital visit.\n\nIn November 1995, allegedly realizing he could not\nsalvage his job, Cardenas began looking for new\nemployment. He left the AOC on March 1, 1996, and\nreceived his \"right-to-sue\" letter from the EEOC on May 28,\n1996.\n\nA hostile work environment, first recognized by the\nSupreme Court as a basis for a discrimination claim under\nTitle VII in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.

Although the District Court agreed that Cardenas\nhad presented evidence of ethnic animus on Massey's part,\nthe court stated that \"a plaintiff cannot prove a case of\nethnic discrimination merely by . . . raising the specter of\ndiscrimination over otherwise legitimate management\ndecisions that may have negatively impacted a minority\nemployee.\" Id. at 24.\n\nWe cannot say that the District Court's evaluation of the\nevidence was not a reasonable one for a trier of fact to\nreach. However, the District Court declined to examine the\npossibility that defendants' \"management decisions\"\nmasked discriminatory intent. As this court has previously\nemphasized, the advent of more sophisticated and subtle\nforms of discrimination requires that we analyze the\naggregate effect of all evidence and reasonable inferences\ntherefrom, including those concerning incidents of facially\nneutral mistreatment, in evaluating a hostile work\nenvironment claim. See Durham, 166 F.3d at 148-49;\nAman, 85 F.3d at 1081-84.\n\nIn addition to the oral and written ethnic slurs cited by\nthe District Court, Cardenas has provided evidence from\nwhich a jury might find ethnic animus underlying other\nostensibly nondiscriminatory incidents. For example,\ndisproportionate assignment of minority employees to the\nonly unit supervised by a minority manager might create an\nimpression of, or be motivated by an intent to achieve,\n\n                                15\n\fsegregation. Likewise, consistently lower performance\nevaluations for a protected class member as compared to\nnon-protected co-workers may indicate discriminatory\nintent.7\n\nDefendants contest the manner in which Cardenas has\nmade numerical equivalents, but Cardenas' figures create\nan inference strong enough that we cannot disregard the\nevidence for purposes of summary judgment. The AOC's\nevaluation process is subjective and a jury could conclude\nthat Massey, who allegedly subjected Cardenas to\nethnically-charged comments, was motivated by ethnic\nanimus in giving Cardenas lower overall ratings than white\nemployees when Cardenas had higher component ratings.\nSimilarly, a jury could find that Rebo might reasonably\nhave been expected to notice and address this suspect\npattern.\n\nFinally, Cardenas has provided evidence from which a\njury could conclude that Rebo and Massey set him up to\nfail. Cf. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23 (one of many factors which\nmay indicate hostile work environment is \"whether it\nunreasonably interferes with an employee's work\nperformance.\").8 For example, Cardenas testified at his\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7.

The elements of this claim closely\nresemble the first four elements of the Title VII hostile work\nenvironment claim.

Therefore, our discussion of the Title\nVII claim above applies with equal force to this claim's basic\nelements. We conclude that Cardenas has provided\nsufficient evidence of an actionable hostile work\nenvironment under the LAD to survive summary judgment.\n\nCardenas also claims retaliation as another basis for\nliability. The District Court recognized that to establish a\nprima facie retaliation claim under Title VII,S 1981, or the\nLAD, Cardenas must show: (1) that he engaged in a\nprotected activity; (2) that he suffered an adverse\nemployment action; and (3) that there was a causal\nconnection between the protected activity and the adverse\nemployment action.

Dec.\n2 op. at 39. We are satisfied that Cardenas has pointed to\nevidence that he engaged in three protected activities\nbetween June 1994 and January 1995 in the form of his\nown discrimination complaint and his cooperation in the\ncomplaints of two other individuals.\n\nIn Robinson, we stated that an adverse employment\naction is one which is \"serious and tangible enough to alter\nan employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment.\" See 120 F.3d at 1300. Cardenas\nclaims that his resignation was a constructive discharge,\nwhich we will assume arguendo would constitute an\nadverse employment action. \"In order to establish a\nconstructive discharge, a plaintiff must show that the\nemployer knowingly permitted conditions of discrimination\nin employment so intolerable that a reasonable person\nsubject to them would resign.\" Aman, 85 F.3d at 1084\n(quotations omitted). A \"continuous pattern of\ndiscriminatory treatment over a period of years\" may\n\n                               18\n\fconstitute \"intolerable\" conditions even without a particular\negregious precipitating incident. Id. (\"The fact that Aman\nhad been subject to continuous discrimination during her\nemployment could support a conclusion that she simply\nhad had enough. No other precipitating facts were legally\nrequired.\").\n\nThe District Court was willing to assume for purposes of\nsummary judgment that Cardenas suffered a constructive\ndischarge but found missing evidence of any causal link to\nany of the alleged protected activity. As to the poor\nperformance evaluation, which Cardenas also cites here as\nretaliatory, the District Court concluded that Cardenas\nfailed to show that the improper performance evaluation\nwas causally related to Cardenas' engaging in any protected\nactivity. Dec. 2 opinion at 40.\n\nWe are, of course, cognizant of our obligation to view the\nrecord and submissions of the parties so that we may draw\nall reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\nAs is evident from the foregoing, we have been able to find\nenough evidence to show the existence of a genuine issue\nof material fact as to the existence of a hostile work\nenvironment. We have been unable to find any such issue\nwith respect to the required causal element in Cardenas'\nretaliation claim. He contends that the evaluation that\nrated the work he performed through August 1995 as\n\"marginal,\" the lowest he ever received, was not presented\nto him until after the completion of the EEO report. There\nhave been cases in which the temporal relation between an\nadverse employment action and the protected activity has\nenabled the court to draw the inference of causal\nrelationship. See, e.g., Jalil v. Advel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522185\"><a href=\"/opinion/522185/ricardo-jalil-v-avdel-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n708 (3d Cir. 1989) (inferring causation when discharge\noccurred two days after employer's notice of plaintiff 's\nEEOC complaint).

The\ntemporal relationship in this case is, alone, insufficient to\nestablish causation, because the alleged protected activity\n\n                               19\n\ftook place over a substantial period of time and any routine\nemployment action taken during that period would\nnecessarily be related temporally. In such circumstances,\nthere would have to be another basis to permit the\ninference of a causal relationship.\n\nAlthough we have held that many of the employment\nactions to which Cardenas points as retaliatory were part of\nthe fabric of incidents from which a factfinder could\nconclude made for a hostile work environment, it was\nMassey's overt ethnic hostility that formed the thread\nbetween the employment actions and the alleged hostile\nenvironment. There is no similar basis to form a thread\nbetween the same otherwise routine employment actions\nand the protected activity. Our finding such a thread would\nbe sheer speculation. Under that circumstance, we will\naffirm the judgment of the District Court granting\ndefendants summary judgment on Cardenas' retaliation\nclaim.\n\nV.\n\nHaving determined that the District Court's dismissal of\nCardenas' claim for disparate pay on the basis of the\nstatute of limitations was erroneous as a matter of law and\nthat its grant of summary judgment for the defendants on\nliability for a hostile workplace cannot be sustained, we\nmust decide which claim survives as to which defendant.\nInasmuch as Cardenas settled with Massey, the defendant\nwith the most direct culpability, we consider only the\nclaims against the other defendants.\n\nThe District Court, having dismissed the disparate pay\nclaims, never considered which defendants would be liable\nif Cardenas were to prevail on the merits of that claim. Dec.\n2 opinion at 17. We believe it appropriate for the District\nCourt to consider that issue in the first instance. We\ntherefore limit our consideration to the question of liability\non the hostile work environment claim. Of course, if\nCardenas does not prevail, there would be no reason to\nconsider relief as to any of the defendants. Nonetheless, we\nproceed to consider whether there are other grounds to\naffirm the District Court's dismissals as to each defendant\nat this stage.\n\n                               20\n\fCardenas seeks only equitable relief from Chief Justice\nPoritz and Ciancia. He seeks an injunction requiring them\nto implement specific anti-discrimination policies at the\nAOC and alter his employment records retroactively to\nreflect, contrary to fact, a higher pay-grade classification\nand more favorable performance evaluations. In support of\nhis position, Cardenas cites authority for the proposition\nthat Title VII, S 1981, and the LAD all provide for equitable\nrelief, see 42 U.S.C.

Therefore, a\nchange in AOC anti-discrimination policies will not make\nhim \"whole\" or remedy violations he contends the\ndefendants committed.9 Regarding Cardenas' novel request\nfor an injunction requiring the AOC to alter his\nperformance evaluations and pay-grade classification to\nreflect not what they actually were but what they would\nhave been without discrimination, he has presented no\nprecedent, nor have we found one, granting equitable relief\nwhich would require a public agency to complete its records\ncounterfactually. We therefore affirm the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment to Ciancia and Poritz regarding\nCardenas' claim for equitable relief.\n\nWe consider next whether there is any basis on which\nCardenas could maintain his claims for a hostile work\nenvironment against the state of New Jersey. The Supreme\nCourt recently reviewed the standard for Title VII employer\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9.

An employer is liable for acts\ncommitted by its employees in the scope of their\nemployment, which may include some types of disparate\ntreatment of employees by supervisors, such as\ndiscriminatory reprimands or job assignments. See\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 798-99. Pure harassment (e.g., ethnic\nslurs) is not within the scope of employment and the Court\nsuggested that hostile work environment cases will most\noften properly be analyzed under the rubric of either\nemployer negligence or vicarious liability. See id. at 802-07;\nEllerth, 524 U.S. at 757-59.\n\nThe Court held that employers are subject to vicarious\nliability under Title VII for hostile work environments\ncreated by supervisory employees. However, it also\nenunciated an affirmative defense limiting this liability\nwhen the plaintiff has not suffered a tangible adverse\nemployment action. The defense depends on the\nreasonableness of both the employer's and the plaintiff 's\npreventative and remedial measures. Specifically, the Court\nheld:\n\n       An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a\n       victimized employee for an actionable hostile\n       environment created by a supervisor with immediate\n       (or successively higher) authority over the employee.\n       When no tangible employment action is taken, a\n       defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to\n       liability or damages, subject to proof by a\n       preponderance of the evidence . . . . The defense\n       comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the\n       employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and\n       correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and\n       (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to\n       take advantage of any preventive or corrective\n       opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid\n       harm otherwise. . . . No affirmative defense is available,\n       however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates\n       in a tangible employment action, such as discharge,\n       demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\n\n                               22\n\fEllerth, 524 U.S. at 765; Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807-08.\n\nIn this case, the District Court held that although\nCardenas had made a prima facie case showing a hostile\nwork environment based on Massey's ethnically disparaging\ncomments, the undisputed evidence \"shows that the\ndefendants took reasonable steps to prevent harassment in\nthe workplace, and the plaintiff failed to avail himself of the\nAOC's complaint procedure until December, 1994.\" Dec. 2\nopinion at 34. The court continued, \"[o]nce the plaintiff did\nfile a complaint, the undisputed evidence shows that the\nAOC took immediate, albeit temporary, remedial measures\nwhile it conducted an investigation, and the harassment\nstopped.\" Id.\n\nCardenas does not have to prove at this stage that New\nJersey is liable for a hostile work environment. Instead, he\nneed merely show that there is a genuine issue of material\nfact that it may be held liable for employer liability. If\nCardenas does prove the existence of a hostile work\nenvironment, New Jersey will be liable if (1) Cardenas\nshows that Massey's overt harassment or Rebo's more\nsubtle approach led to a tangible employment action or (2)\none of the two bases for an Ellerth/Faragher affirmative\ndefense as to employer supervisory liability is not available.\nCardenas argues that his resignation from the AOC was in\nfact a constructive discharge which would constitute a\ntangible employment action and preclude New Jersey from\nusing the Ellerth/Faragher defense. 10 If Cardenas convinces\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. \"A tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in\nemployment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote,\nreassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision\ncausing a significant change in benefits.\" Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 761.

It follows that\nhe presented enough to survive summary judgment on the\nconstructive discharge issue, and hence New Jersey's\nemployer liability.\n\nEven if the alleged hostile work environment had not\nculminated in a tangible employment action, summary\njudgment for New Jersey based on the Ellerth/Faragher\ndefense, which the District Court found dispositive, would\nbe premature. There are factual issues outstanding as to\nthe reasonableness of the parties' respective actions. As the\nDistrict Court pointed out, Cardenas did delay before filing\na formal EEO complaint and did refuse the alternative\npositions the AOC offered him. On the other hand, he had\ncomplained informally to Rebo, Massey, and Battle, the\nEEO Officer, and Battle refused to address Cardenas'\nconcerns without a formal complaint. In these\ncircumstances, Cardenas' reluctance to file a formal\ncomplaint for fear of aggravating the situation or branding\nhimself a troublemaker might not have been unreasonable.\n\nCardenas argues that the AOC's published anti-\ndiscrimination policy and complaint procedure, on which\nthe District Court relied, was insufficient to satisfy\nEllerth/Faragher for a number of reasons.

Moreover, a\nsupervisor has a duty under New Jersey law to act against\nharassment, and a supervisor's violation of this duty by\neither deliberate indifference or affirmative harassment\nsubjects the supervisor to LAD liability. Hurley , 174 F.3d at\n128 (citing New Jersey cases); see also id. at 126 (failure to\nact may qualify as aiding and abetting when it rises to the\nlevel of \"substantial assistance or encouragement.\")\n(quotation omitted).\n\nWe need not reach that issue as to Lipscher because the\nonly evidence implicating Lipscher in discriminatory\nactivities is his ultimate responsibility for the investigation\n\n                               26\n\fas the AOC Director. There is no evidence suggesting that\nhe was aware of, but ignored, Cardenas' cries for help or\ndefects in the investigation. There is no evidence that\nLipscher discriminated against Cardenas or was\ndeliberately indifferent to the discrimination he suffered.\nThe evidence indicates that Lipscher had little contact with\nCardenas and that he did not make the type of daily\nmanagerial decisions Cardenas claims masked Massey's\nand Rebo's discriminatory intent. There is no evidence that\nLipscher had any reason to believe Cardenas' direct\nsupervisors were breaching their duty not to discriminate.\nLipscher's acceptance of the investigator's report, which\nCardenas characterizes as a \"whitewash\" and which\nexcused Massey's derogatory comments (or purported to\nexplain why they were not derogatory), does not create a\ngenuine issue as to his discriminatory intent. Cardenas has\nnot presented any evidence that Lipscher had reason to\nbelieve the report was inaccurate, incomplete, or in bad\nfaith. No reasonable jury could find that Lipscher aided or\nabetted any discrimination against Cardenas. The evidence\nshows that Lipscher took Cardenas' complaint seriously,\nassigned an investigator to the case, and accepted the\ninvestigator's report. We agree with the District Court that\na reasonable jury could not find any basis for liability as to\nLipscher, either individually or in his official capacity.\n\nRetention of Rebo is, of course, a different matter. The\nmajority of the behavior which Cardenas found offensive\nwas perpetrated by either Rebo or Massey. Whether Rebo\nwas involved in, or deliberately indifferent to, many of the\nallegedly discriminatory actions contributing to the claimed\nhostile work environment is an issue of fact. For example,\nRebo was allegedly aware of some of Massey's comments\nand conflicting directives to Cardenas but failed to prevent\nthem. He also controlled personnel assignments resulting in\ndisproportionate numbers of both minorities and trainees in\nCardenas' unit, and somehow the fact that Rebo had\nselected Cardenas in part based on his ethnicity became\ncommon knowledge in ISD. Moreover, Rebo failed to\nrecommend Cardenas' reclassification after assigning\nCardenas duties which he had previously used to help\njustify a reclassification for another employee and after\nCardenas' successful negotiations with AT&T. Finally, Rebo\n\n                               27\n\freviewed and approved Massey's allegedly disparate\nperformance reviews of his subordinates. A reasonable jury\ncould conclude from the available evidence that Rebo was\ndeliberately indifferent to, or participated in, Massey's\nalleged harassment of Cardenas. There is sufficient basis to\nraise a question of fact as to Rebo's liability on the basis of\nintentional discrimination under the LAD and under\nS 1981. We will, therefore, reverse the District Court's grant\nof summary judgment to Rebo and remand for further\nproceedings.11\n\nVI.\n\nTo summarize, we will reverse the District Court's order\ngranting summary judgment for defendants on Cardenas'\ndisparate pay claims and remand for a determination on\nthe merits as to those claims; we will reverse the District\nCourt's grant of summary judgment to New Jersey on\nCardenas' claim of a hostile work environment under Title\nVII and the LAD; we will reverse the District Court's grant\nof summary judgment on behalf of Rebo on Cardenas' claim\nof a hostile work environment under S 1981 and the LAD,\nand in all other respects we will affirm the District Court's\ngrant of summary judgment.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. We have found it difficult to discern the bases of some of Cardenas'\nclaims. On remand, the District Court may use the procedures available\nunder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require Cardenas to narrow\nand clarify his remaining claims and their evidentiary bases.\n\n                               28\n\f</pre>",
