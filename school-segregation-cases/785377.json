The district court granted summary\njudgment in favor of Defendants, dismissing the Relators’ claims pursuant to\nthe FCA’s public disclosure bar because it found there was a public disclosure\nof the allegations and transactions on which the complaint is based and that\n\n\n       * Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH\nCIR.

Thereafter, the Relators filed a\nmotion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2), which was denied.\nRelators appealed both decisions, and the appeals were consolidated. We\nAFFIRM both the grant of summary judgment and the denial of Rule 60(b)(2)\nrelief.\n                                   I. Background\nA. The Defendants’ Regulatory Obligations\n          The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”)\ngrants federal funding to units of local government for the purpose of\n“providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding\neconomic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.”\n42 U.S.C. §§ 5301(c), 5303. Because the City receives grants from HUD, it is\nannually required to submit various reports and certifications to HUD,\nincluding a certification that it will “affirmatively further fair housing\n[(“AFFH”)], which means that it will conduct an analysis to identify\nimpediments to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction [(“AI”)], take\nappropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments,” and maintain\nrecords of the analysis and actions taken. 24 C.F.R. § 91.225(a)(1). In a similar\nfashion, the DHA is also required to certify that it will AFFH. See 24 C.F.R.\n§ 903.7(o).\n          Since 1985, pursuant to the action Walker v. City of Mesquite, No. 3:85-\nCV-1210 (N.D. Tex.), the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Texas has monitored the DHA’s compliance with its obligations under the\nprograms it administers, including its obligation to AFFH. The City and HUD\nwere parties to the Walker litigation, and a consent decree entered into in that\ncase also required the City to AFFH and submit records of its actions to the\ncourt, the parties, and a special master. While operating under this consent\ndecree, the City completed AIs in 1994 and 1998. The 1998 AI and the City’s\n                                          2\n\f    Case: 13-10884     Document: 00512721590      Page: 3   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                           Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nefforts to AFFH were challenged in the Walker litigation through the\n“Plaintiffs’ Motion to Require City to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing\nDesegregation.” The City also completed a separate AI in 2007.\nB. Relators’ Personal Experiences\n      In 2007, the Dallas City Council approved a conditional development\nagreement with Relators for redeveloping a 32-story office building in\nDowntown Dallas into a housing complex (the “LTV Project”). Despite the City\ninitially approving $102 million in bond funding, construction never began on\nthe project and the available funding lapsed. The Relators allege that city\nofficials made statements indicating their disapproval of the project due to the\nRelators’ proposed amount of low-income housing in the building. Primarily,\nthe Relators allege that the Director of Economic Development for the City told\nthem that “Downtown Dallas is not the right place for low-income housing” and\nthat “low-income housing is not part of the vision for Downtown Dallas.” From\ntheir interactions with the City, the Relators “came to the conclusion that the\nCity was actively discouraging the development of low-income housing\navailable for people of color outside of the Southern Sector” of the City and that\n“the City was not promoting housing integration, but rather was furthering\nsegregation.” To corroborate their conclusion, Relators embarked on a fifteen-\nmonth investigation that involved compiling data and performing analyses of\nDHA properties, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project locations, and City\nplans and reports.\n      In 2010, Relators filed a formal complaint with HUD against the City,\nalleging discriminatory housing practices by the City. This administrative\naction, styled “1600 Pacific LP v. City of Dallas,” HUD Case Nos. 06-10-0449-\n4, -6, -8, -9, was ongoing at the time the district court dismissed this case, but,\nas discussed more fully below, has since resulted in a HUD Letter of Findings\nagainst the City.\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 4   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\n      The Relators have not had any personal experiences with the DHA itself,\nand the HUD administrative action did not involve the DHA.\nC. Procedural Background\n      In February of 2011, Relators filed this action on behalf of the United\nStates, alleging that the City and DHA violated 31 U.S.C. § 3729 by making\nfalse certifications and submitting false claims for federal housing funds. After\nthe United States decided not to intervene, the Relators served the Defendants\nwith a forty-page amended complaint, which generally alleges that the\nDefendants certified that they were AFFH while failing to conduct a proper AI.\nThe complaint quotes extensively from the HUD Fair Housing Planning Guide\n(“HUD Guide”) and explains how the Defendants have not complied with\nHUD’s guidelines on how properly to conduct an AI. It alleges that the City’s\n1993, 1998, and 2007 AIs were deficient for failing to analyze various\nimpediments in accordance with the HUD regulations and the HUD Guide.\n      The complaint also alleges that the City encouraged discriminatory\nhousing practices and, therefore, failed to AFFH but did not include this\nimpediment its AIs. This section contains the only reference to Relators’\npersonal experiences with the City, a passing paragraph in a lengthy\ncomplaint.\n      As to the DHA, the complaint alleges that, in completing its Public\nHousing Agency Plan, the DHA “falsely certified its compliance with civil\nrights and fair housing laws as well as its obligations to AFFH.” It also alleges\nthat the DHA was complicit with the violations committed by the City.\n      The Defendants filed motions to dismiss arguing, inter alia, that the\ndistrict court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under the FCA’s public\ndisclosure bar. See § 3730(e)(4). The parties appended substantial evidence to\ntheir briefing on the motions to dismiss, and the district court converted the\nmotions to summary judgment motions. The court granted summary judgment\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 5   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nfor the Defendants, holding that there was a public disclosure of the allegations\nor transactions underlying the complaint and that the Relators were not an\noriginal source of the information.\n      Relators timely appealed. While briefing in this court was ongoing,\nRelators filed a Rule 60(b)(2) motion to set aside the judgment in the district\ncourt, seeking an indicative ruling pursuant to Rule 62.1. See FED. R. CIV. P.\n60(b)(2) & 62.1. Relators argued that a recently issued HUD Letter of Findings\nof Non-Compliance against the City and recent news articles constituted newly\ndiscovered evidence that made clear that they were an original source. HUD’s\nletter of findings concluded that the City was “in noncompliance with Title VI\nof the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Section 109 of the Housing and Community\nDevelopment Act of 1974, and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.” The\ndistrict court denied the Relators’ Rule 60(b)(2) motion, finding that the newly\ndiscovered evidence was cumulative and would not change the court’s decision.\nRelators timely appealed the denial of their motion, and the two appeals were\nconsolidated.\n                            II. Standard of Review\n      A challenge under § 3730(e)(4)’s public disclosure bar “is necessarily\nintertwined with the merits and is, therefore, properly treated as a motion for\nsummary judgment.” United States ex rel. Jamison v. McKesson Corp., 649\nF.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo. Id. Summary judgment is\nproper if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant,\nthere is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law. Id.; see FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).\n      We review a district court’s denial of relief under Rule 60(b) for abuse of\ndiscretion. Hesling v. CSX Transp., Inc., 396 F.3d 632, 638 (5th Cir. 2005). A\n\n\n                                       5\n\f     Case: 13-10884       Document: 00512721590          Page: 6     Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                               Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\ndistrict court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view\nof the law or a clearly erroneous view of the evidence. Id.\n                                      III. Discussion\n       The FCA imposes monetary liability on any person who knowingly\npresents a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly\nmakes a false statement material to a false claim. See § 3729(a)(1). The FCA\nauthorizes private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the United States\nto enforce its provision, see § 3730(b); however, it bars certain private actions\nthat involve publicly disclosed allegations, see § 3730(e)(4) (the “public\ndisclosure bar”). The prior version of the public disclosure bar provided that\n“[n]o court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon\nthe public disclosure of allegations or transactions” unless “the person bringing\nthe action is an original source of the information” or the Attorney General. 31\nU.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A) (2006). Relators argue that, because they are an original\nsource, the district court erred in holding that their claims were barred by this\nprovision. 1\n       Under the prior version of the public disclosure bar, an original source is\n“an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information\non which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the\ninformation to the Government before filing an action under this section.”\n§ 3730(e)(4)(B).     Here, the determination turns on the “knowledge” prong\n\n\n       1  In 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the public\ndisclosure bar was amended such that the jurisdictional language was eliminated and other\nlanguage was modified. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4) (2012). The parties agreed below and on\nappeal that the prior version of the public disclosure bar applied to any conduct of the\nDefendants that occurred prior to July 22, 2010. See, e.g., United States ex rel. May v. Purdue\nPharma L.P., 737 F.3d 908, 914–18 (4th Cir. 2013). The parties dispute whether the current\nversion of the public disclosure bar applies to the minimal conduct of the Defendants that\nwas alleged to have occurred after July 22, 2010. Because we conclude, infra, that Relators’\narguments under the current version of the public disclosure bar also fail, we need not resolve\nthis dispute.\n                                              6\n\f     Case: 13-10884       Document: 00512721590         Page: 7     Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                               Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nbecause there is no dispute on appeal that Relators voluntarily provided the\ninformation to the Government prior to suit. Id. The direct and independent\nknowledge inquiry focuses on the Relators’ knowledge underlying the specific\nallegations of the complaint. See Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S.\n457, 470–71 (2007).\n       Direct knowledge is “firsthand knowledge,” United States ex rel. Fried v.\nWest Indep. Sch. Dist., 527 F.3d 439, 442 (5th Cir. 2008), that was “derived\nfrom the source without interruption or gained by the relator’s own efforts\nrather than learned second-hand through the efforts of others,” United States\nex rel. Reagan v. E. Tex. Med. Ctr. Reg’l Healthcare Sys., 384 F.3d 168, 177 (5th\nCir. 2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                      Similarly,\nindependent knowledge is knowledge that does not depend or rely on public\ndisclosures. See Fried, 527 F.3d at 442–43; Reagan, 384 F.3d at 177. The\nburden is on the Relators to show that “the information and allegations [they]\ndiscovered were qualitatively different information than what had already\nbeen discovered and not merely the product and outgrowth of publicly disclosed\ninformation.” Fried, 527 F.3d at 443 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n       The Relators attempt to meet their burden by pointing to two categories\nof knowledge: (1) knowledge personally learned from their LTV Tower project; 2\nand (2) knowledge learned from their further investigation. In Reagan, we\nconsidered and rejected a similar argument that a relator’s minimal personal\n\n\n\n       2  Relators’ personal experiences with the City regarding the LTV Project do not\nsupport an original source determination as to the Relators’ claims against the DHA. The\nSupreme Court has held that “[§] 3730(e)(4) does not permit jurisdiction in gross just because\na relator is an original source with respect to some claim.” Rockwell, 549 U.S. at 476\n(explaining that “§ 3730(e)(4) does not permit such claim smuggling”). Relators admit they\nhave no personal experience with the DHA. Their claims against the DHA depend solely on\ntheir investigative knowledge and the alleged relationship between the DHA and the City.\n                                              7\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 8   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nknowledge, when combined with her investigation of publicly disclosed\ninformation, was sufficient to make her an original source. See 384 F.3d at\n178–79; see also Fried, 527 F.3d at 443 (rejecting a similar investigation\nargument).    There, the relator’s personal experiences in her position of\nemployment caused her to become suspicious of certain financial irregularities,\n384 F.3d at 171–72, and led her to investigate by “piecing together fragments\nof documentation through [Freedom of Information Act] requests, interviews,\nand review of documents in the state archives,” id. at 178 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We found that the relator’s knowledge was “almost entirely\nindirect” because it was “based on research and review of public records, not,\nwith minor exceptions, her own observation.” Id. at 178–79. We also found\nthat her knowledge was not independent because it was “derived almost\nentirely from information that has been publicly disclosed.” Id. at 178. We\nthus held that she was not an original source. Id. at 179–80.\n      Reagan controls here.     The Relators’ knowledge of the information\nunderlying their complaint is “almost entirely indirect” because it is “based on\nresearch and review of public records, not, with minor exceptions, [their] own\nobservation.” Id. at 178–79. The Relators’ personal experiences with the City\non the LTV Project form the basis for only one paragraph in their 40-page\ncomplaint and serve as but one example of the impediments that Relators\nallege the Defendants failed to analyze in their AIs. As the district court\nobserved, “most of Relators’ complaint is simply regurgitations of HUD\npublished guidelines, census data, publicly disclosed reports, information\ndisclosed by news media, and other information disclosed in statutory sources.”\nThe overwhelming majority of the complaint is thus based, not on the Relators’\npersonal experiences with the City, but on their research of publicly disclosed\ninformation. Accordingly, the Relators knowledge is not independent because\nit is “is derived almost entirely from information that has been publicly\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 9   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\ndisclosed.” Id. at 178.\n      Relators nonetheless argue that they are an original source because their\ninvestigation put HUD “on the trail” of the City’s alleged fraud, relying on the\nfollowing passage from Reagan:\n      It is true that some other circuits have held that a relator may\n      meet the “direct and independent knowledge” requirement by\n      contributing her own investigative efforts and experience to\n      develop allegations of fraud. These cases, however, do not mean\n      that second-hand information may be converted into “direct and\n      independent knowledge” simply because the plaintiff discovered\n      through investigation or experience what the public already knew.\n      Instead, the investigation or experience of the relator either must\n      translate into some additional compelling fact, or must\n      demonstrate a new and undisclosed relationship between disclosed\n      facts, that puts a government agency “on the trail” of fraud, where\n      that fraud might otherwise go unnoticed.\n384 F.3d at 179 (citations omitted). Relators put talismanic significance on the\n“on the trail” language which is not there. But even using their interpretation,\nRelators’ investigation does not make them an original source pursuant to this\navenue because their investigation did not translate the publicly disclosed\ninformation “into some additional compelling fact” or “demonstrate a new and\nundisclosed relationship between disclosed facts.” Id.\n      It was already extensively alleged through public disclosures that the\nCity and DHA were failing to live up to their obligations to AFFH by not\nincluding certain impediments in their AIs and not remedying impediments.\nAllegations such as those made by Relators were publicly disclosed, among\nother places, in news articles, in the long-running Walker litigation, to which\nHUD, the City, and the DHA were parties, and in a review of the City’s actions\nby the Texas Affordable Housing Project. The Relators’ investigation produced\ninformation that mirrored the prior publicly disclosed allegations that the\nDefendants were not AFFH because they were failing properly to analyze\n\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 13-10884       Document: 00512721590          Page: 10     Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                               Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nimpediments and were not promoting housing integration. See Fried, 527 F.3d\nat 443 (“[The relator] merely received information about a program that had\nbeen publicly disclosed and hotly debated.”). The “burden [is] on [the Relators]\nto show that the information and allegations [they] discovered were\nqualitatively different information than what had already been discovered and\nnot merely the product and outgrowth of publicly disclosed information.” Id.\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Relators fail to meet that\nburden. The district court correctly concluded that the Relators were not an\noriginal source under the prior version of § 3730(e)(4)(B).\n       We also reject the Relators’ argument that the district court erred in\nconcluding that they were not an original source under the amended version of\nthe public disclosure bar when considering alleged conduct by Defendants that\noccurred after July 22, 2010. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B) (2012). First,\nRelators have waived any arguments as to the application of the amended\nstatute by arguing on appeal only that which they failed to argue in the district\ncourt. 3 Second, for the reasons stated above, we find no merit in the Relators’\nargument on appeal that they have “knowledge that is independent of and\nmaterially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.”                    Id.\n\n\n       3  Under the current version of the FCA, an original source is “an individual who either\n(i) prior to a public disclosure under subsection (e)(4)(a), has voluntarily disclosed to the\nGovernment the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based, or (2)\n[sic] who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed\nallegations or transactions, and who has voluntarily provided the information to the\nGovernment before filing an action under this section.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B) (2012). The\ndistrict court found that Relators failed to meet either prong. In their briefing before the\ndistrict court on the motion to dismiss, the Relators did not mention the “knowledge prong,”\narguing only that they were an original source pursuant to the “prior voluntary disclosure\nprong.” Therefore, arguments as to the application of the “knowledge prong” are waived. See\nTex. Commercial Energy v. TXU Energy, Inc., 413 F.3d 503, 510 (5th Cir. 2005). Conversely,\nRelators have abandoned any arguments as to the “prior voluntary disclosure prong” by\narguing on appeal only that they are an original source pursuant to the “knowledge prong.”\nSee Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons v. Tex. Med. Bd., 627 F.3d 547, 550 n.2 (5th Cir.\n2010).\n                                             10\n\f    Case: 13-10884      Document: 00512721590         Page: 11    Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                              Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nWhile the language in the current version of the statute differs from the “direct\nand independent knowledge” language in the prior version of the statute, 31\nU.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B) (2006), on the facts of this case, the outcome is the same. 4\n      Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Relators’\nRule 60(b)(2) motion. To warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(2) a movant must\ndemonstrate, inter alia, “that the evidence is material and controlling and\nclearly would have produced a different result if present before the original\njudgment.” Hesling, 396 F.3d at 639 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Here, the “newly discovered evidence” consisted of a HUD Letter of\nFindings of Non-Compliance against the City, which was the culmination of\nthe HUD administrative action initiated by the Relators, as well as news\narticles reporting on the letter.           HUD found that the City was “in\nnoncompliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Section 109 of the\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974, and Section 504 of the 1973\nRehabilitation Act.” The focus of the letter is on specific decisions by the City\nthat were purportedly either discriminatory or did not comply with regulatory\nhousing requirements.        Most prominently, the letter discusses the City’s\ndecision not to approve the LTV Project. The subject of the letter differs from\nthat of this action because it does not discuss the Defendants’ alleged failure\nto AFFH by not properly analyzing various impediments. Given this differing\nfocus, the Relators’ personal experiences with the City on the LTV Project\nfeature much more prominently in the HUD administrative action than they\ndo in the Relators’ complaint in this action\n      Relators argue that this evidence demonstrates that they are an original\nsource because it “shows beyond doubt that Relators placed HUD on the trail\n\n\n      4   Because we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment pursuant to\n§ 3730(e)(4), we do not address the Defendants’ argument that this action is also precluded\nby § 3730(e)(3)’s related litigation bar.\n                                            11\n\f   Case: 13-10884     Document: 00512721590      Page: 12   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nof Dallas’s wrongdoing with information qualitatively different from anything\nthe public previously knew.” We first note that, because it does not discuss or\nimplicate the DHA, the HUD letter would not have produced a different result\nas to whether the Relators were an original source of the information\nunderlying their allegations against the DHA. As to the City, the HUD letter\nsimply shows that HUD found the allegations in the Relators’ administrative\ncomplaint to have merit; it does not offer insight into whether the Relators had\n“direct” and “independent” knowledge of the information underlying their\nseparate complaint in this FCA action, which is predominantly based on an\ninvestigation of publicly disclosed information. The new evidence does not\nchange the fact that the Relators’ knowledge underlying their complaint in this\naction is “based on research and review of public records, not, with minor\nexceptions, [their] own observation.” Reagan, 384 F.3d at 178–79. Nor does it\nshow that the investigation underlying the complaint in this action\ntransformed the publicly disclosed information “into some additional\ncompelling fact” or “demonstrate[d] a new and undisclosed relationship\nbetween disclosed facts.” Id. at 179; see also Fried, 527 F.3d at 443. Since this\nnewly discovered evidence would not clearly have produced a different result,\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Relators’ Rule\n60(b)(2) motion. See Hesling, 396 F.3d at 639.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\f",

We\nAFFIRM both the grant of summary judgment and the denial of Rule 60(b)(2)\nrelief.\n                                   I. Background\nA. The Defendants’ Regulatory Obligations\n          The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”)\ngrants federal funding to units of local government for the purpose of\n“providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding\neconomic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.”\n42 U.S.C. §§ 5301(c), 5303. Because the City receives grants from HUD, it is\nannually required to submit various reports and certifications to HUD,\nincluding a certification that it will “affirmatively further fair housing\n[(“AFFH”)], which means that it will conduct an analysis to identify\nimpediments to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction [(“AI”)], take\nappropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments,” and maintain\nrecords of the analysis and actions taken. 24 C.F.R. § 91.225(a)(1). In a similar\nfashion, the DHA is also required to certify that it will AFFH. See 24 C.F.R.\n§ 903.7(o).\n          Since 1985, pursuant to the action Walker v. City of Mesquite, No. 3:85-\nCV-1210 (N.D. Tex.), the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Texas has monitored the DHA’s compliance with its obligations under the\nprograms it administers, including its obligation to AFFH. The City and HUD\nwere parties to the Walker litigation, and a consent decree entered into in that\ncase also required the City to AFFH and submit records of its actions to the\ncourt, the parties, and a special master. While operating under this consent\ndecree, the City completed AIs in 1994 and 1998. The 1998 AI and the City’s\n                                          2\n\f    Case: 13-10884     Document: 00512721590      Page: 3   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                           Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nefforts to AFFH were challenged in the Walker litigation through the\n“Plaintiffs’ Motion to Require City to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing\nDesegregation.” The City also completed a separate AI in 2007.\nB. Relators’ Personal Experiences\n      In 2007, the Dallas City Council approved a conditional development\nagreement with Relators for redeveloping a 32-story office building in\nDowntown Dallas into a housing complex (the “LTV Project”). Despite the City\ninitially approving $102 million in bond funding, construction never began on\nthe project and the available funding lapsed. The Relators allege that city\nofficials made statements indicating their disapproval of the project due to the\nRelators’ proposed amount of low-income housing in the building. Primarily,\nthe Relators allege that the Director of Economic Development for the City told\nthem that “Downtown Dallas is not the right place for low-income housing” and\nthat “low-income housing is not part of the vision for Downtown Dallas.” From\ntheir interactions with the City, the Relators “came to the conclusion that the\nCity was actively discouraging the development of low-income housing\navailable for people of color outside of the Southern Sector” of the City and that\n“the City was not promoting housing integration, but rather was furthering\nsegregation.” To corroborate their conclusion, Relators embarked on a fifteen-\nmonth investigation that involved compiling data and performing analyses of\nDHA properties, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project locations, and City\nplans and reports.\n      In 2010, Relators filed a formal complaint with HUD against the City,\nalleging discriminatory housing practices by the City. This administrative\naction, styled “1600 Pacific LP v. City of Dallas,” HUD Case Nos. 06-10-0449-\n4, -6, -8, -9, was ongoing at the time the district court dismissed this case, but,\nas discussed more fully below, has since resulted in a HUD Letter of Findings\nagainst the City.\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 4   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\n      The Relators have not had any personal experiences with the DHA itself,\nand the HUD administrative action did not involve the DHA.\nC. Procedural Background\n      In February of 2011, Relators filed this action on behalf of the United\nStates, alleging that the City and DHA violated 31 U.S.C. § 3729 by making\nfalse certifications and submitting false claims for federal housing funds. After\nthe United States decided not to intervene, the Relators served the Defendants\nwith a forty-page amended complaint, which generally alleges that the\nDefendants certified that they were AFFH while failing to conduct a proper AI.\nThe complaint quotes extensively from the HUD Fair Housing Planning Guide\n(“HUD Guide”) and explains how the Defendants have not complied with\nHUD’s guidelines on how properly to conduct an AI. It alleges that the City’s\n1993, 1998, and 2007 AIs were deficient for failing to analyze various\nimpediments in accordance with the HUD regulations and the HUD Guide.\n      The complaint also alleges that the City encouraged discriminatory\nhousing practices and, therefore, failed to AFFH but did not include this\nimpediment its AIs. This section contains the only reference to Relators’\npersonal experiences with the City, a passing paragraph in a lengthy\ncomplaint.\n      As to the DHA, the complaint alleges that, in completing its Public\nHousing Agency Plan, the DHA “falsely certified its compliance with civil\nrights and fair housing laws as well as its obligations to AFFH.” It also alleges\nthat the DHA was complicit with the violations committed by the City.\n      The Defendants filed motions to dismiss arguing, inter alia, that the\ndistrict court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under the FCA’s public\ndisclosure bar. See § 3730(e)(4). The parties appended substantial evidence to\ntheir briefing on the motions to dismiss, and the district court converted the\nmotions to summary judgment motions. The court granted summary judgment\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 5   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nfor the Defendants, holding that there was a public disclosure of the allegations\nor transactions underlying the complaint and that the Relators were not an\noriginal source of the information.\n      Relators timely appealed. While briefing in this court was ongoing,\nRelators filed a Rule 60(b)(2) motion to set aside the judgment in the district\ncourt, seeking an indicative ruling pursuant to Rule 62.1. See FED. R. CIV. P.\n60(b)(2) & 62.1. Relators argued that a recently issued HUD Letter of Findings\nof Non-Compliance against the City and recent news articles constituted newly\ndiscovered evidence that made clear that they were an original source. HUD’s\nletter of findings concluded that the City was “in noncompliance with Title VI\nof the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Section 109 of the Housing and Community\nDevelopment Act of 1974, and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.” The\ndistrict court denied the Relators’ Rule 60(b)(2) motion, finding that the newly\ndiscovered evidence was cumulative and would not change the court’s decision.\nRelators timely appealed the denial of their motion, and the two appeals were\nconsolidated.\n                            II. Standard of Review\n      A challenge under § 3730(e)(4)’s public disclosure bar “is necessarily\nintertwined with the merits and is, therefore, properly treated as a motion for\nsummary judgment.” United States ex rel.

Id.\n                                      III. Discussion\n       The FCA imposes monetary liability on any person who knowingly\npresents a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly\nmakes a false statement material to a false claim. See § 3729(a)(1). The FCA\nauthorizes private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the United States\nto enforce its provision, see § 3730(b); however, it bars certain private actions\nthat involve publicly disclosed allegations, see § 3730(e)(4) (the “public\ndisclosure bar”). The prior version of the public disclosure bar provided that\n“[n]o court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon\nthe public disclosure of allegations or transactions” unless “the person bringing\nthe action is an original source of the information” or the Attorney General. 31\nU.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A) (2006). Relators argue that, because they are an original\nsource, the district court erred in holding that their claims were barred by this\nprovision. 1\n       Under the prior version of the public disclosure bar, an original source is\n“an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information\non which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the\ninformation to the Government before filing an action under this section.”\n§ 3730(e)(4)(B).     Here, the determination turns on the “knowledge” prong\n\n\n       1  In 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the public\ndisclosure bar was amended such that the jurisdictional language was eliminated and other\nlanguage was modified. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4) (2012). The parties agreed below and on\nappeal that the prior version of the public disclosure bar applied to any conduct of the\nDefendants that occurred prior to July 22, 2010. See, e.g., United States ex rel. May v. Purdue\nPharma L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 914–18 (4th Cir. 2013). The parties dispute whether the current\nversion of the public disclosure bar applies to the minimal conduct of the Defendants that\nwas alleged to have occurred after July 22, 2010. Because we conclude, infra, that Relators’\narguments under the current version of the public disclosure bar also fail, we need not resolve\nthis dispute.\n                                              6\n\f     Case: 13-10884       Document: 00512721590         Page: 7     Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                               Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nbecause there is no dispute on appeal that Relators voluntarily provided the\ninformation to the Government prior to suit.

Similarly,\nindependent knowledge is knowledge that does not depend or rely on public\ndisclosures. See Fried, 527 F.3d at 442–43; Reagan, 384 F.3d at 177. The\nburden is on the Relators to show that “the information and allegations [they]\ndiscovered were qualitatively different information than what had already\nbeen discovered and not merely the product and outgrowth of publicly disclosed\ninformation.” Fried, 527 F.3d at 443 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n       The Relators attempt to meet their burden by pointing to two categories\nof knowledge: (1) knowledge personally learned from their LTV Tower project; 2\nand (2) knowledge learned from their further investigation. In Reagan, we\nconsidered and rejected a similar argument that a relator’s minimal personal\n\n\n\n       2  Relators’ personal experiences with the City regarding the LTV Project do not\nsupport an original source determination as to the Relators’ claims against the DHA. The\nSupreme Court has held that “[§] 3730(e)(4) does not permit jurisdiction in gross just because\na relator is an original source with respect to some claim.” Rockwell, 549 U.S. at 476\n(explaining that “§ 3730(e)(4) does not permit such claim smuggling”). Relators admit they\nhave no personal experience with the DHA. Their claims against the DHA depend solely on\ntheir investigative knowledge and the alleged relationship between the DHA and the City.\n                                              7\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 8   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nknowledge, when combined with her investigation of publicly disclosed\ninformation, was sufficient to make her an original source. See 384 F.3d at\n178–79; see also Fried, 527 F.3d at 443 (rejecting a similar investigation\nargument).    There, the relator’s personal experiences in her position of\nemployment caused her to become suspicious of certain financial irregularities,\n384 F.3d at 171–72, and led her to investigate by “piecing together fragments\nof documentation through [Freedom of Information Act] requests, interviews,\nand review of documents in the state archives,” id. at 178 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We found that the relator’s knowledge was “almost entirely\nindirect” because it was “based on research and review of public records, not,\nwith minor exceptions, her own observation.” Id. at 178–79. We also found\nthat her knowledge was not independent because it was “derived almost\nentirely from information that has been publicly disclosed.” Id. at 178. We\nthus held that she was not an original source. Id. at 179–80.\n      Reagan controls here.     The Relators’ knowledge of the information\nunderlying their complaint is “almost entirely indirect” because it is “based on\nresearch and review of public records, not, with minor exceptions, [their] own\nobservation.” Id. at 178–79. The Relators’ personal experiences with the City\non the LTV Project form the basis for only one paragraph in their 40-page\ncomplaint and serve as but one example of the impediments that Relators\nallege the Defendants failed to analyze in their AIs. As the district court\nobserved, “most of Relators’ complaint is simply regurgitations of HUD\npublished guidelines, census data, publicly disclosed reports, information\ndisclosed by news media, and other information disclosed in statutory sources.”\nThe overwhelming majority of the complaint is thus based, not on the Relators’\npersonal experiences with the City, but on their research of publicly disclosed\ninformation. Accordingly, the Relators knowledge is not independent because\nit is “is derived almost entirely from information that has been publicly\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 13-10884    Document: 00512721590     Page: 9   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\ndisclosed.” Id. at 178.\n      Relators nonetheless argue that they are an original source because their\ninvestigation put HUD “on the trail” of the City’s alleged fraud, relying on the\nfollowing passage from Reagan:\n      It is true that some other circuits have held that a relator may\n      meet the “direct and independent knowledge” requirement by\n      contributing her own investigative efforts and experience to\n      develop allegations of fraud. These cases, however, do not mean\n      that second-hand information may be converted into “direct and\n      independent knowledge” simply because the plaintiff discovered\n      through investigation or experience what the public already knew.\n      Instead, the investigation or experience of the relator either must\n      translate into some additional compelling fact, or must\n      demonstrate a new and undisclosed relationship between disclosed\n      facts, that puts a government agency “on the trail” of fraud, where\n      that fraud might otherwise go unnoticed.\n384 F.3d at 179 (citations omitted). Relators put talismanic significance on the\n“on the trail” language which is not there. But even using their interpretation,\nRelators’ investigation does not make them an original source pursuant to this\navenue because their investigation did not translate the publicly disclosed\ninformation “into some additional compelling fact” or “demonstrate a new and\nundisclosed relationship between disclosed facts.” Id.\n      It was already extensively alleged through public disclosures that the\nCity and DHA were failing to live up to their obligations to AFFH by not\nincluding certain impediments in their AIs and not remedying impediments.\nAllegations such as those made by Relators were publicly disclosed, among\nother places, in news articles, in the long-running Walker litigation, to which\nHUD, the City, and the DHA were parties, and in a review of the City’s actions\nby the Texas Affordable Housing Project. The Relators’ investigation produced\ninformation that mirrored the prior publicly disclosed allegations that the\nDefendants were not AFFH because they were failing properly to analyze\n\n                                       9\n\f    Case: 13-10884       Document: 00512721590          Page: 10     Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                               Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nimpediments and were not promoting housing integration. See Fried, 527 F.3d\nat 443 (“[The relator] merely received information about a program that had\nbeen publicly disclosed and hotly debated.”). The “burden [is] on [the Relators]\nto show that the information and allegations [they] discovered were\nqualitatively different information than what had already been discovered and\nnot merely the product and outgrowth of publicly disclosed information.” Id.\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Relators fail to meet that\nburden. The district court correctly concluded that the Relators were not an\noriginal source under the prior version of § 3730(e)(4)(B).\n       We also reject the Relators’ argument that the district court erred in\nconcluding that they were not an original source under the amended version of\nthe public disclosure bar when considering alleged conduct by Defendants that\noccurred after July 22, 2010. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B) (2012). First,\nRelators have waived any arguments as to the application of the amended\nstatute by arguing on appeal only that which they failed to argue in the district\ncourt. 3 Second, for the reasons stated above, we find no merit in the Relators’\nargument on appeal that they have “knowledge that is independent of and\nmaterially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.”                    Id.\n\n\n       3  Under the current version of the FCA, an original source is “an individual who either\n(i) prior to a public disclosure under subsection (e)(4)(a), has voluntarily disclosed to the\nGovernment the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based, or (2)\n[sic] who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed\nallegations or transactions, and who has voluntarily provided the information to the\nGovernment before filing an action under this section.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B) (2012). The\ndistrict court found that Relators failed to meet either prong. In their briefing before the\ndistrict court on the motion to dismiss, the Relators did not mention the “knowledge prong,”\narguing only that they were an original source pursuant to the “prior voluntary disclosure\nprong.” Therefore, arguments as to the application of the “knowledge prong” are waived. See\nTex. Commercial Energy v. TXU Energy, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790827\"><a href=\"/opinion/790827/texas-commercial-energy-a-texas-limited-liability-company-v-txu-energy/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510 (5th Cir. 2005). Conversely,\nRelators have abandoned any arguments as to the “prior voluntary disclosure prong” by\narguing on appeal only that they are an original source pursuant to the “knowledge prong.”\nSee Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgeons v. Tex. Med. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180260\"><a href=\"/opinion/180260/association-of-amer-physicians-v-texas-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 550 n.2 (5th Cir.\n2010).\n                                             10\n\f    Case: 13-10884      Document: 00512721590         Page: 11    Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                              Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nWhile the language in the current version of the statute differs from the “direct\nand independent knowledge” language in the prior version of the statute, 31\nU.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B) (2006), on the facts of this case, the outcome is the same. 4\n      Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Relators’\nRule 60(b)(2) motion. To warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(2) a movant must\ndemonstrate, inter alia, “that the evidence is material and controlling and\nclearly would have produced a different result if present before the original\njudgment.” Hesling, 396 F.3d at 639 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Here, the “newly discovered evidence” consisted of a HUD Letter of\nFindings of Non-Compliance against the City, which was the culmination of\nthe HUD administrative action initiated by the Relators, as well as news\narticles reporting on the letter.           HUD found that the City was “in\nnoncompliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Section 109 of the\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974, and Section 504 of the 1973\nRehabilitation Act.” The focus of the letter is on specific decisions by the City\nthat were purportedly either discriminatory or did not comply with regulatory\nhousing requirements.        Most prominently, the letter discusses the City’s\ndecision not to approve the LTV Project. The subject of the letter differs from\nthat of this action because it does not discuss the Defendants’ alleged failure\nto AFFH by not properly analyzing various impediments. Given this differing\nfocus, the Relators’ personal experiences with the City on the LTV Project\nfeature much more prominently in the HUD administrative action than they\ndo in the Relators’ complaint in this action\n      Relators argue that this evidence demonstrates that they are an original\nsource because it “shows beyond doubt that Relators placed HUD on the trail\n\n\n      4   Because we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment pursuant to\n§ 3730(e)(4), we do not address the Defendants’ argument that this action is also precluded\nby § 3730(e)(3)’s related litigation bar.\n                                            11\n\f   Case: 13-10884     Document: 00512721590      Page: 12   Date Filed: 08/04/2014\n\n\n\n                          Nos. 13-10884 & 14-10063\nof Dallas’s wrongdoing with information qualitatively different from anything\nthe public previously knew.” We first note that, because it does not discuss or\nimplicate the DHA, the HUD letter would not have produced a different result\nas to whether the Relators were an original source of the information\nunderlying their allegations against the DHA. As to the City, the HUD letter\nsimply shows that HUD found the allegations in the Relators’ administrative\ncomplaint to have merit; it does not offer insight into whether the Relators had\n“direct” and “independent” knowledge of the information underlying their\nseparate complaint in this FCA action, which is predominantly based on an\ninvestigation of publicly disclosed information. The new evidence does not\nchange the fact that the Relators’ knowledge underlying their complaint in this\naction is “based on research and review of public records, not, with minor\nexceptions, [their] own observation.” Reagan, 384 F.3d at 178–79. Nor does it\nshow that the investigation underlying the complaint in this action\ntransformed the publicly disclosed information “into some additional\ncompelling fact” or “demonstrate[d] a new and undisclosed relationship\nbetween disclosed facts.” Id. at 179; see also Fried, 527 F.3d at 443. Since this\nnewly discovered evidence would not clearly have produced a different result,\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Relators’ Rule\n60(b)(2) motion. See Hesling, 396 F.3d at 639.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\f</pre>",
