Sections 2 and 5, Article VII,\nConstitution of Texas; Articles 5415a, 5421c-3, V.C.S.\n\n            Section 2 of Article VII of the Constitution of Texas\nprovides:\n\n           \"All funds, lands and other property hereto-\n     fore set apart and appropriated for the support\n     of public schools;' all the alternate sections of\n     land reserved by the State out of grants hereto-\n     fore made or that may hereafter be made to rail-\n     roads or'other corporations of any nature whatso,-\n     ever ; one half of the public domain of the State:\n     and all sums of money that may come to the State\n     from the sale of any portion of the same, shall\n     constitute a perpetual public school fund.\"\n\n          The effect of Section 2 of Article VII of the Consti-\ntution of Texas was not to vest in the school fund an undivided\none-half interest of all the public domain unappropriated at\nthe time of its adoption, but to vest in the school fund one-\nhalf of such public land as shoclld remain unappropriated for the\nother purposes enumerated in the Constitution;- Hbgue v. Baker,\n92 Tex. 63, 45 S.W. 1004 (1898).\n\n          In State v. Bradford, 121 Tex. 515, 50 S.W.Zd 1065\n(1932), the Supreme Court stated that the Constitution did not\nindependently of legislative acts place beds of channels of\nnavigable streams in the permanent school fund.\n\n          In determining what was placed in the permanent school\nfund, in Hogue v.~ Baker, supra, the Supreme Court in constru-\ning Section 2 of Article VII of the Constitution of Texas stated:\n            II\n                 .  The plain purpose of the section is\n                     .   .\n\n     to declare what shall be the school fund. Lands\n     theretofore set apart to that fund are preserved\n     tom it, ~:and..it\n                     is further declared that one-half\n     of the public domain shall constitute a part of\n     the constitutional dedication.    In our opinion,\n     it fixed the right of the school~fund in one-\n     half of the ,unappropriated public domain, but\n     left the legislature, as we have previously\n     intimated, with extended authority over the\n     segregation of that interest by partition of\n     the lands or of their proceeds.    It gave to the\n     school fund the right to an equitable half of\n     the public domain, and,in so far the provision\n     executed itself.    . . .\n                                -1756-\n\fHon.

Walker, 73 S.W.2d\n520, 524 (Tex.Comm.App. 1934):\n\n          “By the pertinent provisions of chapter 11,\n     Acts (1st Called Sess.) 26th Leg.

Under\n     such act of 1900, when proof of~occupancy was\n     not filed in the General Land Office and pay-\n     ment of patent fees made, and patent applied\n     for, before~January 1, 1902, thisland became\n     absolutely-and unconditionally the~property\n     of the said~public school fund.

Sadler, 399 S.W.Zd 411 (Tex.Civ.\nApp. 1966, error ref. n.r.e.1. For the,purposes of this opinion\nit is not necessary to review this entire history, but it may\nbe stated that submerged lands have always been treated in a\nspecial category since the earliest days of the Republic.\n\n          It was held in State v. Bryan, 210 S.W.2d 455 (Tex;\nCiv.App. 1948, error ref. n.r.e.), that:\n\n           \"We think there can be no serious question\n     but that the bed of Green Lake (regardless of\n     its navigableness vel non) was a part of the\n     public domain set aside to the permanent school\n     fund. This appears from the tabulation that was\n     made under Chap. XVI, p. 14, Gen.Laws, 26th Leg.,\n     1899; and from the wording of the Settlement Act\n     (Chap.

Preston Smith, page 5 (M-356)\n\n\n\n46th Legislature, R.S., 1939, Ch. 3, p. 465. The Court pointed\nout that the Settlement Act of 1900 specifically provided that\n\"this Act shall not have the effect to transfer to the school\nfund any of the lakes, bays, and islands on the Gulf of Mexico\nwithin tidewater limits, whether surveyed or unsurveyed.\"\n\n           In 1898 the Supreme Court in Hogue v. Baker, supra,\njudicially determined that the half of the public domain not\ndedicated to the school fund had already been exhausted and\nwhatremains   \"belongs equitably to that fund.\" The Court further\nheld:\n\n          \"In our opinion, it [Tex.Const., Art.  VTI,  Sec.\n     21 fixed the right of the school fund in one-half\n     of the unappropriated public domain, but left the\n     legislature,, as we have previously intimated, with\n     extended authority over the segregation of that in-\n     terest by partition of the lands or of their pro-\n     ceeds. It gave to the school fund the right to\n     an equitable half of the public domain, and in so\n     far the provision executed itself. The mode of\n     partition or of the segregation of that half, ex-\n     cept as to alternate certificates granted to rail-\n     road companies and other corporations, was left\n     wholly to legislative control; and it seems to\n     us that, if the legislature had made a partition\n     or provided a mode of segregation, its action\n     would have been conclusive.   We see no good rea-\n     son why value should not have been the guide in\n     making a division, and, since this involved the\n     determination of a question of fact, its action\n     could hardly be the subject of review by the\n     courts, unless, perchance, it should appear ob-\n     viously and grossly inequitable.    . . .\n\n          \"It follows from what has been said that, in\n     our opinion, where the legislature has taken af-\n     firmative action, and has provided pro tanto for\n     the segregation of the interest of the school fund,\n     its action is final.  . . .\" (Brackets ours.)\n\n           Therefore the Court in construing Section 2 of Article\nVII established the principle that the Constitution fixed the\nright of the permanent school fund in one-half of the unappro-\npriated public domain, but left to the Legislature the mode of\npartit~ion or of segregation of that half and held that where\nthe Legislature had taken affirmative action with regard to\nsuch partition its action is final. The Legislature in 1900\npassed the Settlement Act which settled permanently the division\n                               -1759-\n\f                                                     ,   .\n\n\n\n\nHon. Preston Smith, page 6   (M-356)\n\n\n\n\nof the public domain included in the Settlement Act. The Settle-\nment Act (S.S.B. 2, Acts of the 26th Legislature, 1st Called\nSession, 1900, Ch. XI, p. 29) specifically provided:\n\n         \"Section 1. For the purpose of adjusting and\n    finally settling the controversy between the perma-\n    nent school fund and the State of Texas, growing\n    out of the division of the public domain, there is\n    hereby set apart and granted to said school fund four\n    million, four hundred and forty-four thousand and\n    one hundred and ninety-five acres or all of the     ;\n    unappropriated public domain remaining in the State\n    of Texas of whatever character, and wheresoever\n    located, including any lands hereafter recovered.\n    by the State, except that included in lakes, bays\n    and islands,along the Gulf of Mexico within tide\n    water limits, whether the same be more or less\n    than said four million, four hundred and forty-\n    four thousand one hundred and ninety-five acres;\n    provided, this act shall not have the effect to\n    transfer to the school fund any of the lakes, bays\n    and islands on the Gulf of Mexico within tide\n    water limits whether surveyed or unsurveyed.\"\n\n          Nothing contained in the Constitution or in the cases\nconstruing Section 2 of Article VII prevents the Legislature from\nplacing those lands excluded by Section 1 of the Settlement Act,\nabove quoted,~in the permanent school fund. The Legislature has\nsubsequently (in 1939 --Article 5421c-3, and in 1941--Article\n5415a) placed these lands in the permanent school fund,and it\nis our opinion the same rule must apply to those lands as was\napplied to lands contained in the Settlement Act, to wit: the\nlegislative action is final.\n\n          Furthermore, it was held in Eyl v. State, 84 S.W. 607\n(Tex.Civ.App. 1904, error ref.):\n          II\n               .

Preston Smith, page 5 (M-356)\n\n\n\n46th Legislature, R.S., 1939, Ch. 3, p. 465. The Court pointed\nout that the Settlement Act of 1900 specifically provided that\n\"this Act shall not have the effect to transfer to the school\nfund any of the lakes, bays, and islands on the Gulf of Mexico\nwithin tidewater limits, whether surveyed or unsurveyed.\"\n\n           In 1898 the Supreme Court in Hogue v. Baker, supra,\njudicially determined that the half of the public domain not\ndedicated to the school fund had already been exhausted and\nwhatremains   \"belongs equitably to that fund.\" The Court further\nheld:\n\n          \"In our opinion, it [Tex.Const., Art.  VTI,  Sec.\n     21 fixed the right of the school fund in one-half\n     of the unappropriated public domain, but left the\n     legislature,, as we have previously intimated, with\n     extended authority over the segregation of that in-\n     terest by partition of the lands or of their pro-\n     ceeds. It gave to the school fund the right to\n     an equitable half of the public domain, and in so\n     far the provision executed itself. The mode of\n     partition or of the segregation of that half, ex-\n     cept as to alternate certificates granted to rail-\n     road companies and other corporations, was left\n     wholly to legislative control; and it seems to\n     us that, if the legislature had made a partition\n     or provided a mode of segregation, its action\n     would have been conclusive.   We see no good rea-\n     son why value should not have been the guide in\n     making a division, and, since this involved the\n     determination of a question of fact, its action\n     could hardly be the subject of review by the\n     courts, unless, perchance, it should appear ob-\n     viously and grossly inequitable.    . . .\n\n          \"It follows from what has been said that, in\n     our opinion, where the legislature has taken af-\n     firmative action, and has provided pro tanto for\n     the segregation of the interest of the school fund,\n     its action is final.  . . .\" (Brackets ours.)\n\n           Therefore the Court in construing Section 2 of Article\nVII established the principle that the Constitution fixed the\nright of the permanent school fund in one-half of the unappro-\npriated public domain, but left to the Legislature the mode of\npartit~ion or of segregation of that half and held that where\nthe Legislature had taken affirmative action with regard to\nsuch partition its action is final.
