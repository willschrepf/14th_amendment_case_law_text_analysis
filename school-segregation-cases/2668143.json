The trial\n\ncourt resolved some issues by directed verdict; other issues were presented to the\n\fjury for resolution. Salesi obtained a judgment against the Pugas for $7,217.19 in\n\ndamages and $51,169.36 in attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Pugas appeal that judgment and contend that the trial court erred by\n\n(1) awarding Salesi damages on her encroachment claim, (2) awarding Salesi any\n\nattorney’s fees or, alternatively, awarding too much, and (3) failing to submit for\n\nthe jury’s determination the Pugas’ own attorney’s fee claim.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n                                   Background\n\n      This is a boundary dispute between Barbara Salesi and the owners of the\n\nproperty next door, Ronny and Rickey Puga. Several years before the litigation, the\n\nPugas repaired a sewage leak in their backyard and asked Salesi for permission to\n\ntemporarily remove the boundary fence to access underground pipes. She agreed.\n\nThe Pugas removed the chain-link fence but also allegedly removed and replaced\n\none of Salesi’s support posts. Salesi alleged that the Pugas also removed survey\n\nirons that marked the property line.\n\n      Sometime after the first encounter, the Pugas asked permission to attach a\n\nportion of a new fence they were constructing to a different support post on\n\nSalesi’s property. She refused. Nonetheless, according to Salesi, they attached their\n\nfence to her post while she was at work. When she realized what had occurred, the\n\nparties argued and a witness called the police to intervene. Ultimately, Salesi\n\n\n                                         2\n\fobtained a judgment against the Pugas for $350 to replace the post to which they\n\nattached their new fence. Subsequently, another dispute arose when Salesi alleged\n\nthat the Pugas damaged three additional fence posts on her property.\n\n      As tensions grew, the Pugas’ attorney sent Salesi a letter alleging that one of\n\nher fence posts was on the Pugas’ property and threatening litigation. Salesi\n\ninvestigated and concluded that, when the Pugas took down her fence to repair\n\ntheir sewage line, they also removed one of her fence posts and repositioned it\n\nwithin their property. She testified that she understood the attorney’s letter to be\n\nreferencing this post. Salesi responded to the Pugas’ letter by suggesting that the\n\nparties adhere to a 2006 survey of her property1 and that the fence be moved, if\n\nnecessary, to return it to the property line shown in that survey. According to\n\nSalesi, the Pugas never responded to her suggestion.\n\n      Salesi filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that the\n\n2006 survey accurately depicted the property lines and that the Pugas were bound\n\nby that demarcation. She also sought damages for the cost to return the fence posts\n\nto their original location. In other words, she sought a declaration and damages to\n\nresolve in her favor the allegation in the Pugas’ presuit letter that her fence post\n\nwas on their property.\n\n1\n      That survey was conducted by court order in a separate lawsuit in which another\n      neighbor sued Barbara Salesi. The court ordered a “survey [of] both properties in\n      question with special attention to the disputed boundary line . . . .” The 2006\n      survey established the perimeter line of all of Salesi’s property.\n                                          3\n\f      While suit was pending, Salesi discovered that, when the Pugas were doing\n\nthe sewage line repairs, they installed an underground pipe that ran under the\n\nchain-link fence and connected to pipes within her property. She sought damages\n\nfor rerouting the Pugas’ pipe to remove it from her property.\n\n      Salesi filed a “motion to enforce court order,” requesting that the trial court\n\nbind the parties to the 2006 survey. The Pugas did not respond to the motion. The\n\nmotion was granted.\n\n      Separately, Salesi moved for the trial court to take judicial notice that the\n\n2006 court-ordered survey “is the proper survey of [her] property and the border\n\nand with the Pugas’ property, as well.” Salesi explained that she filed the\n\npreviously granted motion to enforce “to put the issue of where the proper property\n\nlines are to bed” and that, after the Pugas failed to respond or to designate an\n\nexpert and the trial court granted the motion, they should not be permitted to\n\nchallenge the location of the property lines. After discussion, the trial court\n\nconfirmed that Salesi could refer to the 2006 survey during trial as “the survey that\n\nthis Court has held to be . . . the actual property lines for these properties.”\n\n      Salesi preadmitted her trial exhibits, including the 2006 survey, without\n\nobjection. The parties also entered into a stipulation regarding Pugas’ backyard\n\nplumbing work. They stipulated as follows: “The parties stipulate that the PVC\n\npipe as depicted in Plaintiff’s Ex. 8 was installed by Defendants and runs from the\n\n\n                                            4\n\fPuga property onto the Salesi property and connects to the concrete pipe that runs\n\nthrough the Salesi property.”\n\n      During trial, Salesi testified that she wanted the fence moved back to the\n\nproperty line and the Pugas’ pipe disconnected and rerouted. Salesi’s contractor\n\ntestified about the cost to move the fence and reroute the pipe. He offered two\n\nalternative routes for moving the pipe, the least expensive of which was\n\napproximately $5,000.\n\n      The Pugas, their contractor, and one of their former tenants testified as well.\n\nDuring direct examination, the Pugas disputed moving Salesi’s fence post;\n\nhowever, on cross-examination they agreed that they had testified otherwise in\n\ntheir depositions.\n\n      Attorneys for both sides testified about attorneys’ fees. Salesi’s attorney\n\ntestified that she should be awarded $40,700 in reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees to cover pretrial through post-judgment services and an additional\n\n$25,000 in case of appeal. The Pugas’ attorney testified that they should be\n\nawarded $53,425.22 in fees.\n\n      At the conclusion of the evidence, Salesi moved for a directed verdict on\n\ntwo of her claims: (1) a declaration that the property boundary is where indicated\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fin the 2006 survey and that all of her fence posts are within her property 2 and (2) a\n\nliability finding on her encroachment claim based on the Puga pipe crossing the\n\nproperty boundary and tying into her pipe. The trial court granted a directed verdict\n\non both issues.\n\n      The single liability question in the court’s charge asked whether the Pugas\n\nwere “negligent,” and the jury found that both of them were. The second question\n\nasked the cost to (1) replace and reposition the fence, (2) replace other fence posts,\n\nand (3) replace and reposition the survey iron that Salesi alleged had been removed\n\nby the Pugas. The jury awarded an amount for each, totaling $2,070.87.\n\n      The next question was a damages question related to the directed verdict for\n\nencroachment and asked the cost to remove and reposition the plumbing line from\n\nSalesi’s property to be within the boundary of the Pugas’ property. The jury\n\nanswered the damages question by awarding zero dollars.\n\n      Next, the jury was asked about Salesi’s attorney’s fees. 3 The jury awarded\n\n$35,000 for past fees and zero dollars for appellate fees. The trial court did not\n\nsubmit a jury question on the amount of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees\n\n\n\n2\n      Specifically, it was a declaration related to the proposed jury question whether “all\n      of the Plaintiff’s fence posts other than the Puga pipe post [which the Pugas\n      allegedly moved while making sewer pipe repairs] are within the boundaries of\n      Plaintiff’s property.”\n3\n      Salesi elected to have the jury determine her attorney’s fees.\n                                            6\n\ffor the Pugas. The Pugas neither requested the question nor objected to its\n\nomission.\n\n         Finally, the jury was asked whether Rickey or Ronny Puga acted with\n\nmalice. The jury concluded that they did not and awarded no exemplary damages.\n\n         Salesi filed a motion to disregard jury findings and for entry of final\n\njudgment. First, she argued that the trial court should disregard the jury’s zero\n\ndamages finding with regard to the encroachment claim. She argued that she\n\nconclusively proved through expert testimony a minimum of $5,146.32 as the cost\n\nto remove the Pugas’ pipe from her property.\n\n         Second, she argued that she established her attorney’s fees with undisputed\n\nevidence and, therefore, requested that the trial court disregard the jury’s finding\n\nand increase her fee award to $51,169.39.\n\n         The Pugas did not respond to Salesi’s motion to disregard. There is no\n\nwritten order in the record concerning the motion; however, the final judgment\n\nreflects that the trial court did award encroachment damages and attorney’s fees in\n\nthe requested amounts. The Pugas timely appealed.\n\n                              Encroachment Damages\n\n         In their third issue, the Pugas contend that the trial court erred by\n\ndisregarding the jury’s decision not to award damages on Salesi’s encroachment\n\nclaim.\n\n\n                                          7\n\fA.    Standard of review\n\n      It is within the jury’s province, as the factfinder, to resolve conflicts in\n\nevidence and determine issues of witness credibility; however, a jury “cannot\n\nignore undisputed testimony that is clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible, free\n\nfrom contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily\n\ncontroverted.” City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 820 (Tex. 2005).\n\n      A trial court may disregard a jury’s finding that has no support in the\n\nevidence. TEX. R. CIV. P. 301; Tiller v. McLure, 121 S.W.3d 709, 713 (Tex. 2003);\n\nBrown v. Bank of Galveston, N.A., 963 S.W.2d 511, 513 (Tex.1998); Williams v.\n\nBriscoe, 137 S.W.3d 120, 124 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.). “A\n\ntrial court may disregard a jury’s negative finding and substitute its own\n\naffirmative finding only if the evidence conclusively establishes the affirmative\n\nfinding.” Cale’s Clean Scene Carwash, Inc. v. Hubbard, 76 S.W.3d 784, 786 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.). We view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the finding. Tiller, 121 S.W.3d at 713; Williams, 137 S.W.3d at 124.\n\nB.    Damages were established\n\n      At trial, Salesi’s contractor testified that the Pugas’ underground pipe could\n\nbe rerouted off of Salesi’s property in one of two ways, the least expensive of\n\nwhich would cost approximately $5,000 while the more expensive would cost over\n\n$9,000. His work estimates were admitted into evidence without objection. He was\n\n\n                                         8\n\fnot cross-examined on the cost projections. The Pugas did not designate an expert\n\non the issues of encroachment or damages related to Salesi’s claim. In her motion\n\nto disregard jury findings, Salesi requested that the trial court award the lower of\n\nthe two estimate amounts as encroachment damages. The trial court awarded that\n\namount.\n\n      Salesi contends that she established damages of at least the amount awarded\n\nthrough undisputed expert testimony at trial. But the Pugas contend that Salesi\n\ncould not have established a right to that lower amount of damages as a matter of\n\nlaw because the expert testified about two different work plans with two different\n\ntotal costs, which according to the Pugas, “by definition contradict each other.”\n\n      Salesi’s expert, however, proffered undisputed evidence that the cost of\n\nrerouting the pipe would be at least the amount that the trial court awarded.\n\nAlthough the Pugas cross-examined Salesi’s expert about the nature of the\n\nencroachment and whether it existed before they purchased the property, they did\n\nnot challenge the expert’s testimony regarding the estimated amounts to reroute the\n\npipe or proffer their own evidence about the cost. Because the evidence adduced at\n\ntrial conclusively proved damages of at least the amount awarded, we conclude\n\nthat the trial court did not err by disregarding the jury’s zero damages\n\ndetermination and, instead, awarding damages on the encroachment claim in the\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\famount requested, which corresponded to the lesser of the two repair estimates.\n\nSee City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 820.\n\n      We overrule this issue.\n\n                       Salesi’s Claim for Attorney’s Fees\n\n      The Pugas make four arguments challenging Salesi’s fee award. First, they\n\nargue that there is no basis in law for an award of attorney’s fees because Salesi\n\ndid not obtain a declaratory judgment against them. Second, they argue that a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action is an improper vehicle to resolve property boundaries\n\nand, therefore, the Declaratory Judgments Act does not support the award of\n\nattorney’s fees. Third, they argue that the fee should have been reduced to\n\nsegregate between recoverable and nonrecoverable claims. Fourth, they challenge\n\nthe award because the jury charge did not require that the fees awarded be\n\nnecessary. We turn first to whether a final judgment must contain a declaration to\n\nentitle a movant to attorney’s fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act.\n\nA.    Declaration in Judgment Unnecessary for Fee Award under the Act\n\n      Salesi’s second amended petition requested a declaration that she owned the\n\nproperty depicted in the 2006 survey. After both parties rested, Salesi was granted\n\na directed verdict on her declaratory judgment claim that her property boundaries\n\nalign with the 2006 survey and that her fence posts are within that designated\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fproperty line. The final judgment, however, does not contain this declaratory\n\nrelief.\n\n          Under the Declaratory Judgments Act, a trial court may exercise its\n\ndiscretion to award attorney’s fees to the prevailing party, the nonprevailing party,\n\nor neither, considering the equities in the case. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 37.009 (providing that trial court may award attorney’s fees that are\n\nequitable and just in “any proceeding under this chapter”); Barshop v. Medina\n\nCnty. Underground Water Conservation Dist., 925 S.W.2d 618, 637 (Tex. 1996)\n\n(holding that award of attorney’s fees in declaratory judgment action is within trial\n\ncourt’s discretion and is not dependent on finding that party substantially\n\nprevailed). “Moreover, the statute does not require a judgment on the merits of the\n\ndispute as a prerequisite to a fee award.” Feldman v. KPMG LLP, 438 S.W.3d 678,\n\n685 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (discussing Barshop and\n\nconcluding that trial court has power to award attorney’s fees under Section 37.009\n\neven if declaratory relief claim is dismissed). Thus, the Pugas are incorrect to\n\ncontend that the absence of declaratory relief from the final judgment precludes, as\n\na matter of law, an attorney’s fee award in this declaratory judgment action.\n\nB.        Boundary disputes may be resolved with declaratory relief\n\n          The Pugas argue that Salesi cannot resolve a property boundary dispute\n\nthrough a declaratory judgment action and, therefore, the Declaratory Judgments\n\n\n                                         11\n\fAct does not support the attorney’s fees awarded to her in this case. They rely on\n\nMartin v. Amerman, 133 S.W.3d 262, 265 (Tex. 2004), to support their argument.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n      Although Martin held that a boundary dispute must be resolved through a\n\ntrespass to try title action instead of a declaratory judgment, 133 S.W.3d at 265,\n\nthat opinion was later superseded by an amendment to Section 37.004, which\n\nspecifically permits resolution of boundary disputes through declaratory judgment\n\nactions. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.004(c); see also Nw. Indep.\n\nSch. Dist. v. Carroll Indep. Sch. Dist., 441 S.W.3d 684, 689 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2014, pet. denied) (explaining that “the state legislature overruled Martin by\n\nadding Subsection (c) to Section 37.004 of the Declaratory Judgments Act” and, in\n\ndoing so, “simply removed the prohibition, based on the supreme court’s\n\nconstruction of the [Declaratory Judgments] Act in Martin, against using the Act to\n\ndetermine boundaries.”).\n\n      Thus, Salesi was permitted to seek resolution of her property dispute through\n\na declaratory judgment action, through which attorney’s fees could be awarded.\n\nSee TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §§ 37.004(c) (permitting resolution of\n\nboundary disputes through declaratory judgment action); 37.009 (allowing\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees in declaratory judgment action).\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fC.    Unsegregated Attorney’s Fees\n\n      The Pugas also argue that the attorney’s fees awarded to Salesi were in error\n\nbecause she failed to segregate her attorney’s fees. The Pugas makes two\n\narguments in this regard. First, they argue that the attorney’s fees incurred by\n\nSalesi pursuing the declaratory judgment relief should have been segregated from\n\nthe fees incurred pursuing her negligence claim. Second, they argue that Salesi\n\ncould only recover fees incurred before the court granted her motion and accepted\n\nthe 2006 survey because, from that point forward, there was no dispute over the\n\nboundary line.\n\n      Assuming without deciding that Salesi was required to segregate her fees\n\nand failed to do so properly, the Pugas never objected to the attorney’s fee\n\ntestimony. Additionally, the jury question on attorney’s fees asked generally about\n\nfees incurred “as a result of this lawsuit,” and the Pugas failed to object to the\n\nwording of the question.\n\n      Because the Pugas failed to object to either the attorney’s testimony on\n\nunsegregated fees or the related jury charge question, any error regarding\n\nsegregation has been waived. See, e.g., Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384,\n\n389 (Tex. 1997) (holding that, “if no one objects to the fact that the attorney’s fees\n\nare not segregated as to specific claims, then the objection is waived”); Turull v.\n\nFerguson, No. 01-09-00067-CV, 2010 WL 2991087, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n\n                                         13\n\f[1st Dist.] July 29, 2010), opinion supplemented on denial of reh’g, No. 01-09-\n\n00067-CV, 2010 WL 3833944 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Sept. 30, 2010)\n\n(mem. op.) (“Because the Timberoof Defendants did not object to the Turulls’\n\ncounsel’s testimony regarding segregation of fees and because there was no\n\nobjection to the wording of the charge that did not ask the jury to segregate\n\nattorney’s fees, any error regarding segregation has been waived.”).\n\nD.    Jury Not Asked if Attorney’s Fees were “Necessary”\n\n      Finally, the Pugas argue that Salesi’s fee award should be reversed and no\n\nattorney’s fees awarded because Salesi failed to obtain a jury finding that her\n\nattorney’s fees were necessary.\n\n      The Pugas did not object to the omission from the jury charge question of\n\nthe element requiring that attorney’s fees be necessary to be awarded. Failure to\n\nobject to the omission of a necessary element in a claim waives a complaint on\n\nappeal that the element was not proven. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 279; Shindler v. Marr\n\n& Assocs., 695 S.W.2d 699, 706 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1985, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.) (error waived regarding omitted issue related to attorney’s fee award\n\nbecause party failed to object). Further, the missing element is deemed found if\n\nthere was factually sufficient evidence on that issue at trial to support a finding.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 279. Salesi’s attorney testified that her fees were reasonable and\n\nnecessary. Because there was factually sufficient evidence on the issue and the\n\n\n                                        14\n\fPugas failed to object to the omission of the “necessary” requirement in the jury\n\ncharge question, we hold that the Pugas waived this complaint.\n\n      We overrule the Pugas’ first and second issues.\n\n                     The Pugas’ Claim for Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In their fourth issue, the Pugas contend that the trial court erred by not\n\nsubmitting to the jury a question on their attorney’s fees. However, the Pugas did\n\nnot submit a proposed jury question on their attorney’s fees or object to its\n\nomission.

The trial\n\ncourt resolved some issues by directed verdict; other issues were presented to the\n\fjury for resolution. Salesi obtained a judgment against the Pugas for $7,217.19 in\n\ndamages and $51,169.36 in attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Pugas appeal that judgment and contend that the trial court erred by\n\n(1) awarding Salesi damages on her encroachment claim, (2) awarding Salesi any\n\nattorney’s fees or, alternatively, awarding too much, and (3) failing to submit for\n\nthe jury’s determination the Pugas’ own attorney’s fee claim.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n                                   Background\n\n      This is a boundary dispute between Barbara Salesi and the owners of the\n\nproperty next door, Ronny and Rickey Puga. Several years before the litigation, the\n\nPugas repaired a sewage leak in their backyard and asked Salesi for permission to\n\ntemporarily remove the boundary fence to access underground pipes. She agreed.\n\nThe Pugas removed the chain-link fence but also allegedly removed and replaced\n\none of Salesi’s support posts. Salesi alleged that the Pugas also removed survey\n\nirons that marked the property line.\n\n      Sometime after the first encounter, the Pugas asked permission to attach a\n\nportion of a new fence they were constructing to a different support post on\n\nSalesi’s property. She refused. Nonetheless, according to Salesi, they attached their\n\nfence to her post while she was at work. When she realized what had occurred, the\n\nparties argued and a witness called the police to intervene. Ultimately, Salesi\n\n\n                                         2\n\fobtained a judgment against the Pugas for $350 to replace the post to which they\n\nattached their new fence. Subsequently, another dispute arose when Salesi alleged\n\nthat the Pugas damaged three additional fence posts on her property.\n\n      As tensions grew, the Pugas’ attorney sent Salesi a letter alleging that one of\n\nher fence posts was on the Pugas’ property and threatening litigation. Salesi\n\ninvestigated and concluded that, when the Pugas took down her fence to repair\n\ntheir sewage line, they also removed one of her fence posts and repositioned it\n\nwithin their property. She testified that she understood the attorney’s letter to be\n\nreferencing this post. Salesi responded to the Pugas’ letter by suggesting that the\n\nparties adhere to a 2006 survey of her property1 and that the fence be moved, if\n\nnecessary, to return it to the property line shown in that survey. According to\n\nSalesi, the Pugas never responded to her suggestion.\n\n      Salesi filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that the\n\n2006 survey accurately depicted the property lines and that the Pugas were bound\n\nby that demarcation. She also sought damages for the cost to return the fence posts\n\nto their original location. In other words, she sought a declaration and damages to\n\nresolve in her favor the allegation in the Pugas’ presuit letter that her fence post\n\nwas on their property.\n\n1\n      That survey was conducted by court order in a separate lawsuit in which another\n      neighbor sued Barbara Salesi. The court ordered a “survey [of] both properties in\n      question with special attention to the disputed boundary line . . . .” The 2006\n      survey established the perimeter line of all of Salesi’s property.\n                                          3\n\f      While suit was pending, Salesi discovered that, when the Pugas were doing\n\nthe sewage line repairs, they installed an underground pipe that ran under the\n\nchain-link fence and connected to pipes within her property. She sought damages\n\nfor rerouting the Pugas’ pipe to remove it from her property.\n\n      Salesi filed a “motion to enforce court order,” requesting that the trial court\n\nbind the parties to the 2006 survey. The Pugas did not respond to the motion. The\n\nmotion was granted.\n\n      Separately, Salesi moved for the trial court to take judicial notice that the\n\n2006 court-ordered survey “is the proper survey of [her] property and the border\n\nand with the Pugas’ property, as well.” Salesi explained that she filed the\n\npreviously granted motion to enforce “to put the issue of where the proper property\n\nlines are to bed” and that, after the Pugas failed to respond or to designate an\n\nexpert and the trial court granted the motion, they should not be permitted to\n\nchallenge the location of the property lines. After discussion, the trial court\n\nconfirmed that Salesi could refer to the 2006 survey during trial as “the survey that\n\nthis Court has held to be . . . the actual property lines for these properties.”\n\n      Salesi preadmitted her trial exhibits, including the 2006 survey, without\n\nobjection. The parties also entered into a stipulation regarding Pugas’ backyard\n\nplumbing work. They stipulated as follows: “The parties stipulate that the PVC\n\npipe as depicted in Plaintiff’s Ex. 8 was installed by Defendants and runs from the\n\n\n                                            4\n\fPuga property onto the Salesi property and connects to the concrete pipe that runs\n\nthrough the Salesi property.”\n\n      During trial, Salesi testified that she wanted the fence moved back to the\n\nproperty line and the Pugas’ pipe disconnected and rerouted. Salesi’s contractor\n\ntestified about the cost to move the fence and reroute the pipe. He offered two\n\nalternative routes for moving the pipe, the least expensive of which was\n\napproximately $5,000.\n\n      The Pugas, their contractor, and one of their former tenants testified as well.\n\nDuring direct examination, the Pugas disputed moving Salesi’s fence post;\n\nhowever, on cross-examination they agreed that they had testified otherwise in\n\ntheir depositions.\n\n      Attorneys for both sides testified about attorneys’ fees. Salesi’s attorney\n\ntestified that she should be awarded $40,700 in reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney’s fees to cover pretrial through post-judgment services and an additional\n\n$25,000 in case of appeal. The Pugas’ attorney testified that they should be\n\nawarded $53,425.22 in fees.\n\n      At the conclusion of the evidence, Salesi moved for a directed verdict on\n\ntwo of her claims: (1) a declaration that the property boundary is where indicated\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fin the 2006 survey and that all of her fence posts are within her property 2 and (2) a\n\nliability finding on her encroachment claim based on the Puga pipe crossing the\n\nproperty boundary and tying into her pipe. The trial court granted a directed verdict\n\non both issues.\n\n      The single liability question in the court’s charge asked whether the Pugas\n\nwere “negligent,” and the jury found that both of them were. The second question\n\nasked the cost to (1) replace and reposition the fence, (2) replace other fence posts,\n\nand (3) replace and reposition the survey iron that Salesi alleged had been removed\n\nby the Pugas. The jury awarded an amount for each, totaling $2,070.87.\n\n      The next question was a damages question related to the directed verdict for\n\nencroachment and asked the cost to remove and reposition the plumbing line from\n\nSalesi’s property to be within the boundary of the Pugas’ property. The jury\n\nanswered the damages question by awarding zero dollars.\n\n      Next, the jury was asked about Salesi’s attorney’s fees. 3 The jury awarded\n\n$35,000 for past fees and zero dollars for appellate fees. The trial court did not\n\nsubmit a jury question on the amount of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees\n\n\n\n2\n      Specifically, it was a declaration related to the proposed jury question whether “all\n      of the Plaintiff’s fence posts other than the Puga pipe post [which the Pugas\n      allegedly moved while making sewer pipe repairs] are within the boundaries of\n      Plaintiff’s property.”\n3\n      Salesi elected to have the jury determine her attorney’s fees.\n                                            6\n\ffor the Pugas. The Pugas neither requested the question nor objected to its\n\nomission.\n\n         Finally, the jury was asked whether Rickey or Ronny Puga acted with\n\nmalice. The jury concluded that they did not and awarded no exemplary damages.\n\n         Salesi filed a motion to disregard jury findings and for entry of final\n\njudgment. First, she argued that the trial court should disregard the jury’s zero\n\ndamages finding with regard to the encroachment claim. She argued that she\n\nconclusively proved through expert testimony a minimum of $5,146.32 as the cost\n\nto remove the Pugas’ pipe from her property.\n\n         Second, she argued that she established her attorney’s fees with undisputed\n\nevidence and, therefore, requested that the trial court disregard the jury’s finding\n\nand increase her fee award to $51,169.39.\n\n         The Pugas did not respond to Salesi’s motion to disregard. There is no\n\nwritten order in the record concerning the motion; however, the final judgment\n\nreflects that the trial court did award encroachment damages and attorney’s fees in\n\nthe requested amounts. The Pugas timely appealed.\n\n                              Encroachment Damages\n\n         In their third issue, the Pugas contend that the trial court erred by\n\ndisregarding the jury’s decision not to award damages on Salesi’s encroachment\n\nclaim.\n\n\n                                          7\n\fA.    Standard of review\n\n      It is within the jury’s province, as the factfinder, to resolve conflicts in\n\nevidence and determine issues of witness credibility; however, a jury “cannot\n\nignore undisputed testimony that is clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible, free\n\nfrom contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily\n\ncontroverted.” City of Keller v.

We view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the finding. Tiller, 121 S.W.3d at 713; Williams, 137 S.W.3d at 124.\n\nB.    Damages were established\n\n      At trial, Salesi’s contractor testified that the Pugas’ underground pipe could\n\nbe rerouted off of Salesi’s property in one of two ways, the least expensive of\n\nwhich would cost approximately $5,000 while the more expensive would cost over\n\n$9,000. His work estimates were admitted into evidence without objection. He was\n\n\n                                         8\n\fnot cross-examined on the cost projections. The Pugas did not designate an expert\n\non the issues of encroachment or damages related to Salesi’s claim. In her motion\n\nto disregard jury findings, Salesi requested that the trial court award the lower of\n\nthe two estimate amounts as encroachment damages. The trial court awarded that\n\namount.\n\n      Salesi contends that she established damages of at least the amount awarded\n\nthrough undisputed expert testimony at trial. But the Pugas contend that Salesi\n\ncould not have established a right to that lower amount of damages as a matter of\n\nlaw because the expert testified about two different work plans with two different\n\ntotal costs, which according to the Pugas, “by definition contradict each other.”\n\n      Salesi’s expert, however, proffered undisputed evidence that the cost of\n\nrerouting the pipe would be at least the amount that the trial court awarded.\n\nAlthough the Pugas cross-examined Salesi’s expert about the nature of the\n\nencroachment and whether it existed before they purchased the property, they did\n\nnot challenge the expert’s testimony regarding the estimated amounts to reroute the\n\npipe or proffer their own evidence about the cost. Because the evidence adduced at\n\ntrial conclusively proved damages of at least the amount awarded, we conclude\n\nthat the trial court did not err by disregarding the jury’s zero damages\n\ndetermination and, instead, awarding damages on the encroachment claim in the\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\famount requested, which corresponded to the lesser of the two repair estimates.\n\nSee City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 820.\n\n      We overrule this issue.\n\n                       Salesi’s Claim for Attorney’s Fees\n\n      The Pugas make four arguments challenging Salesi’s fee award. First, they\n\nargue that there is no basis in law for an award of attorney’s fees because Salesi\n\ndid not obtain a declaratory judgment against them. Second, they argue that a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action is an improper vehicle to resolve property boundaries\n\nand, therefore, the Declaratory Judgments Act does not support the award of\n\nattorney’s fees. Third, they argue that the fee should have been reduced to\n\nsegregate between recoverable and nonrecoverable claims. Fourth, they challenge\n\nthe award because the jury charge did not require that the fees awarded be\n\nnecessary. We turn first to whether a final judgment must contain a declaration to\n\nentitle a movant to attorney’s fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act.\n\nA.    Declaration in Judgment Unnecessary for Fee Award under the Act\n\n      Salesi’s second amended petition requested a declaration that she owned the\n\nproperty depicted in the 2006 survey. After both parties rested, Salesi was granted\n\na directed verdict on her declaratory judgment claim that her property boundaries\n\nalign with the 2006 survey and that her fence posts are within that designated\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fproperty line. The final judgment, however, does not contain this declaratory\n\nrelief.\n\n          Under the Declaratory Judgments Act, a trial court may exercise its\n\ndiscretion to award attorney’s fees to the prevailing party, the nonprevailing party,\n\nor neither, considering the equities in the case. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 37.009 (providing that trial court may award attorney’s fees that are\n\nequitable and just in “any proceeding under this chapter”); Barshop v. Medina\n\nCnty.

(discussing Barshop and\n\nconcluding that trial court has power to award attorney’s fees under Section 37.009\n\neven if declaratory relief claim is dismissed). Thus, the Pugas are incorrect to\n\ncontend that the absence of declaratory relief from the final judgment precludes, as\n\na matter of law, an attorney’s fee award in this declaratory judgment action.\n\nB.        Boundary disputes may be resolved with declaratory relief\n\n          The Pugas argue that Salesi cannot resolve a property boundary dispute\n\nthrough a declaratory judgment action and, therefore, the Declaratory Judgments\n\n\n                                         11\n\fAct does not support the attorney’s fees awarded to her in this case. They rely on\n\nMartin v. Amerman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265 (Tex. 2004), to support their argument.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n      Although Martin held that a boundary dispute must be resolved through a\n\ntrespass to try title action instead of a declaratory judgment, 133 S.W.3d at 265,\n\nthat opinion was later superseded by an amendment to Section 37.004, which\n\nspecifically permits resolution of boundary disputes through declaratory judgment\n\nactions. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.004(c); see also Nw. Indep.\n\nSch. Dist. v. Carroll Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689 (Tex.

CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §§ 37.004(c) (permitting resolution of\n\nboundary disputes through declaratory judgment action); 37.009 (allowing\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees in declaratory judgment action).\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fC.    Unsegregated Attorney’s Fees\n\n      The Pugas also argue that the attorney’s fees awarded to Salesi were in error\n\nbecause she failed to segregate her attorney’s fees. The Pugas makes two\n\narguments in this regard. First, they argue that the attorney’s fees incurred by\n\nSalesi pursuing the declaratory judgment relief should have been segregated from\n\nthe fees incurred pursuing her negligence claim. Second, they argue that Salesi\n\ncould only recover fees incurred before the court granted her motion and accepted\n\nthe 2006 survey because, from that point forward, there was no dispute over the\n\nboundary line.\n\n      Assuming without deciding that Salesi was required to segregate her fees\n\nand failed to do so properly, the Pugas never objected to the attorney’s fee\n\ntestimony. Additionally, the jury question on attorney’s fees asked generally about\n\nfees incurred “as a result of this lawsuit,” and the Pugas failed to object to the\n\nwording of the question.\n\n      Because the Pugas failed to object to either the attorney’s testimony on\n\nunsegregated fees or the related jury charge question, any error regarding\n\nsegregation has been waived.

(“Because the Timberoof Defendants did not object to the Turulls’\n\ncounsel’s testimony regarding segregation of fees and because there was no\n\nobjection to the wording of the charge that did not ask the jury to segregate\n\nattorney’s fees, any error regarding segregation has been waived.”).\n\nD.    Jury Not Asked if Attorney’s Fees were “Necessary”\n\n      Finally, the Pugas argue that Salesi’s fee award should be reversed and no\n\nattorney’s fees awarded because Salesi failed to obtain a jury finding that her\n\nattorney’s fees were necessary.\n\n      The Pugas did not object to the omission from the jury charge question of\n\nthe element requiring that attorney’s fees be necessary to be awarded. Failure to\n\nobject to the omission of a necessary element in a claim waives a complaint on\n\nappeal that the element was not proven. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 279; Shindler v.

Further, the missing element is deemed found if\n\nthere was factually sufficient evidence on that issue at trial to support a finding.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 279. Salesi’s attorney testified that her fees were reasonable and\n\nnecessary.

However, the Pugas did\n\nnot submit a proposed jury question on their attorney’s fees or object to its\n\nomission. Accordingly, any error in the jury charge related to an award of\n\nattorney’s fees to the Pugas was not preserved. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); TEX. R.\n\nCIV. P. 279.\n\n      Further, whether to award attorney’s fees to a party in a declaratory\n\njudgment action is a question of law addressed to the trial court’s discretion based\n\non its determination whether a fee award would be equitable and just.
