Under the June 14, 1983 Standard Contract, the DOE had a legal obligation to begin\ndisposing of SMUD’s spent nuclear fuel (“SNF”) and high-level waste (“HLW”) on, or before,\nJanuary 31, 1998. See 42 U.S.C. § 10222(a)(5)(B). The DOE, however, did not commence\nperformance on that date and has not done so, to date.\n\n        Seventeen years ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that\nDOE’s failure to begin disposing of the nuclear utilities’ SNF and HLW by January 31, 1998 was\na partial breach of the Standard Contract. See Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. United States,\n225 F.3d 1336, 1342–43 (Fed. Cir. 2000). This Memorandum Opinion and Final Order adjudicates\n\fSMUD’s June 8, 2015 Complaint, alleging that SMUD is entitled to damages for mitigation costs\nincurred from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015.1\n\n       To facilitate review of this Post Trial Memorandum Opinion And Final Order, the court\nhas provided the following outline:\n\nI.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY.\n\n       A.      Sacramento Municipal Utility District v. United States, Civil Action Docket No.\n               98-488C.2\n\n        SMUD is a publicly-owned municipal utility district established under the laws of\nCalifornia. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at 339. On June 14, 1983, SMUD and other nuclear-utility\nplants entered into a contract (the “Standard Contract”) with DOE, pursuant to the NWPA. Under\nthe Standard Contract, DOE was legally obligated to begin disposing and storing SMUD’s SNF\nand HLW, by January 31, 1998, and to continue to do so until disposal was complete. See 42\nU.S.C. § 10222(a)(5)(B). In exchange for DOE’s disposal and storage services, SMUD paid fees\nto the Nuclear Waste Fund. See 42 U.S.C. § 10222(a)(5)(B).\n\n       During the 1980’s, SMUD operated the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station (“Rancho\nSeco”), a nuclear power plant located in Sacramento, California. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at\n339. Throughout that time, however, Rancho Seco experienced significant operating problems\nand extended outages. Id. at 340. In fact, the plant worked at full capacity for less than half of its\noperating life. Id. For this and other reasons, on June 6, 1989, the voters of Sacramento chose to\nshut down Rancho Seco. Id. Immediately thereafter, SMUD began preparing for the plant’s\ndecommissioning process.3 Id. To that end, SMUD evaluated storage options for Rancho Seco’s\n\n\n       2\n           The following Memorandum Opinions and Orders were issued in Civil Action Docket\nNo. 98-488C: Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States, 61 Fed. Cl. 438 (2004) (“SMUD I”)\n(denying the Government’s motion to dismiss SMUD’s takings claim and dismissing SMUD’s\nillegal exaction claim); Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States, 63 Fed. Cl. 495 (2005)\n(“SMUD II”) (determining that DOE was liable for a partial breach of the Standard Contract when\nit failed to begin to dispose of SMUD’s SNF by January 31, 1998); Sacramento Mun. Util.\nDist. v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. 332 (2006) (“SMUD III”) (determining that SMUD was entitled\nto mitigation damages for certain costs incurred as a result of DOE’s partial breach of the Standard\nContract); Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 727 (2006) (“SMUD IV”)\n(determining that SMUD was entitled to an award of $39,796,234 in mitigation costs caused by\nDOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract); Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States, 293\nF. App’x 766 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (unpublished) (“SMUD V”) (affirming-in-part SMUD II–IV and\nremanding for the trial court to determine causation, in light of the 1987 Annual Capacity Report,\nand to determine other mitigation costs); Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States, 91 Fed. Cl.\n9 (2009) ( “SMUD VI”) (on remand determining that SMUD was entitled to mitigation costs of\n$53,159,863, but staying entry of a final judgment, pending resolution of a related case, Docket\nNo. 09–587C); In re Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist., 395 F. App’x 684, 688 (Fed. Cir. 2010)\n(unpublished) (denying petition for a writ of mandamus to United States Court of Federal Claims\nto lift stay on judgment).\n       3\n         “Decommission means to remove a facility or site safely from service and reduce residual\nradioactivity to a level that permits . . . (1) Release of the property for unrestricted use and\ntermination of the [United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”)] license; or (2)\nRelease of the property under restricted conditions and termination of the license.” 10 C.F.R. 50.2.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fSNF and, on March 30, 1990, decided to move all of the plant’s SNF from wet-pools, where it was\nbeing stored, to a “dual purpose” dry storage facility.4 Id. at 341–42.\n\n        DOE did not begin to dispose of SMUD’s SNF and HLW by January 31, 1998, as required\nby the Standard Contract.5 Id. at 353. Accordingly, on June 9, 1998, SMUD filed a Complaint\n(“6/9/1998 Compl.”) in Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C, alleging that DOE’s failure to begin\nstoring and disposing of SMUD’s SNF breached the Standard Contract. 6/9/1998 Compl. at ¶ 1.\nSMUD sought mitigation damages for a period that eventually spanned from January 1, 1992 to\nDecember 31, 2003. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at 356.\n\n        On August 31, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that\nDOE breached the Standard Contract in a related case, because DOE did not meet its contractual\nobligation to begin accepting nuclear waste before January 31, 1998. See Maine Yankee Atomic\nPower, 225 F.3d at 1343. On January 19, 2005, the United States Court of Federal Claims\ndetermined that DOE breached the Standard Contract, because Maine Yankee Atomic Power\n“settled the legal issue of whether [DOE’s] failure to begin accepting nuclear waste by January 31,\n1998, constituted a breach . . . [.]” SMUD II, 63 Fed. Cl. at 502–03.\n\n        On March 31, 2006, the court also determined that SMUD was entitled to damages for\ncertain costs incurred from May 15, 1997 to December 31, 2003. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at\n332. Specifically, the court found that SMUD was entitled to recover costs for:\n\n              dry storage of SNF, id. at 367;\n              labor severance and recruiting, id. 369;\n              delays to complete the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (“ISFSI”),6\n               required to implement dry storage of SNF, id.;\n              storing failed SNF, id. at 370;\n\n       4\n         Dry cask storage is a method for storing spent nuclear fuel after it has cooled for at least\none year.         See UNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION GLOSSARY,\nhttps://www.nrc.gov/ reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/dry-cask-storage.html (last visited Feb. 23,\n2017). The fuel is sealed in casks that are welded or bolted closed and surrounded by steel,\nconcrete, lead, or other material to provide leak-tight containment and radiation shielding. See id.\nDual-purpose canisters are designed for dry storage, but also allow SNF to be transported within\na cask unit to a disposal site. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at 341 n.11.\n       5\n          To date, DOE has not disposed of or stored any of SMUD’s SNF or HLW. Answer at\n¶ 22, Sacramento Municipal Utility District v. United States, No. 15-577 (Fed. Cl. July 30, 2015),\nECF No. 7 (“Admits the allegation . . . that the DOE did not begin disposing of SNF and HLW from\ncommercial nuclear utilities, including SMUD, by January 31, 1998, under the standard contract, and\nhas yet to do so.”).\n       6\n            An ISFI is a “complex designed and constructed for the interim storage of spent nuclear\nfuel . . . and other radioactive materials associated with spent fuel[.]” 10 C.F.R. 72.3.\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f              operation and maintenance of the ISFSI, id. at 371;\n              preparation, packaging, inspection, and loading of SNF, id. at 373.\n\nBut, the court determined that SMUD was not entitled to recover costs related to:\n\n              SMUD’s decision to store SNF in dual purpose transportable casks, id. at 374;\n              contracts, or other legal obligations, related to the dry storage project that SMUD\n               incurred prior to May 15, 1997, id.;\n              storage of Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) waste,7 id.;\n              savings accrued when SMUD transferred the Rancho Seco SNF from wet-pool\n               storage to dry storage, id. at 375;\n              internal labor, except for work performed on the dry storage project, id. at 376;\n              overhead costs, id. at 377;\n              on-site drop testing, id. at 378.\n\n       On March 31, 2006, the court also entered an Order Requesting Supplemental Expert\nTestimony, because the court could not ascertain SMUD’s damages with reasonable certainty\nbased on the record. Order Requesting Supplemental Expert Testimony at 1, Sacramento\nMunicipal Utility District v. United States, No. 98-488C (Fed. Cl. Mar. 31, 2006), ECF No. 354.\nThereafter, the parties supplemented the record and, on December 1, 2006, the court determined\nthat SMUD was entitled to an award of $39,796,234. See SMUD IV, 74 Fed. Cl. at 735. Thereafter,\nSMUD and the Government filed cross-appeals. 8\n\n        On August 7, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that\n“the Standard Contract [required] the [DOE] to accept SNF and HLW in accordance with the 1987\nannual capacity report [“ACR”].” SMUD V, 293 F. App’x at 771. That appellate court also held\nthat the United States Court of Federal Claims erred in granting the Government offsets for costs\nrelated to internal labor, dual-purpose caskets, and nonfuel storage, in the amount of $13,363,629.\nId. at 773–75. Accordingly, Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C was remanded, with instructions\nthat the trial court apply the 1987 ACR acceptance rate to assess causation and correct its offset\ndeterminations. See id. at 772.\n\n       On remand, the court applied the 1987 ACR acceptance rate and determined that SMUD\nwas entitled to $39,796,234 in mitigation costs. See SMUD VI, 91 Fed. Cl. at 18. Moreover, in\n\n       7\n        GTCC waste means “low-level radioactive waste that exceeds the concentration limits of\nradionuclides established for Class C waste in [10 C.F.R.] 61.55[.]” 10 C.F.R. 72.3.\n       8\n         In SMUD III, the court found that the parties’ evidence regarding the Standard Contract’s\nacceptance rate, i.e. the rate at which DOE was obligated to accept SNF from SMUD, was highly\nspeculative. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at 375 n.40. For this reason, the court declined to\ndetermine an acceptance rate. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\flight of the appellate court’s holding that the Government should not receive offsets related to\ninternal labor, dual-purpose caskets and nonfuel storage, the court determined that SMUD was\nentitled to an additional $13,363,629. Id. Finally, the court denied the Government’s request for\nan offset related to savings that SMUD allegedly realized between 2004 and 2008. Id. at 19. The\ncourt found that, on September 4, 2009, SMUD filed a Complaint in Civil Action Docket No. 09-\n587C, seeking damages from January 1, 2004 onward and determined that any offset realized after\nJanuary 1, 2004, therefore, should be adjudicated in that case. Id. at 19. The court, however,\nstayed judgment in Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C, pending the court’s resolution of Civil\nAction Docket No. 09-587C. Id.\n\n       On March 12, 2010, SMUD filed a Petition For A Writ Of Mandamus, requesting that the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit order the court to lift the stay in Civil Action\nDocket No. 98–488C. On September 16, 2010, SMUD’s Petition was denied. See In re\nSacramento Mun. Util. Dist., 395 F. App’x at 688.\n\n       B.      Sacramento Municipal Utility District v. United States, Civil Action Docket No.\n               09-587C.\n\n       On September 4, 2009, SMUD filed a Complaint (“9/4/2009 Compl.”) in Civil Action\nDocket No. 09-587C alleging that, “[a]s a direct and proximate result of the [G]overnment’s partial\nbreach of the [Standard] Contract . . . SMUD has suffered [] damages from January 1, 2004\nforward, and will continue to suffer damages in the future.” 9/4/2009 Compl. at ¶ 23. On May\n17, 2011, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, granting SMUD leave to\nsupplement the September 4, 2009 Complaint to allege a claim for damages incurred through\nDecember 31, 2009. See Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States, 98 Fed. Cl. 495, 499 (2011)\n(“SMUD VII”).\n\n        From October 24, 2011 to October 27, 2011, the court held a trial in Washington, D.C., to\nadjudicate the amount of damages that SMUD was entitled to recover for the period from January\n1, 2004 to December 31, 2009. On January 31, 2013, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion\nand Final Order in Civil Action Docket No. 09-587C, determining that SMUD was entitled to\n$53,159,863 for costs incurred to mitigate the Government’s partial breach of the Standard\nContract from 1992 to 2003, plus $20,703,595 for costs incurred from 2004 to 2009. See\nSacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States, 109 Fed. Cl. 660, 708 (2013) (“SMUD VIII”). The\ncourt also determined that the Government was entitled to an offset of $34,987,913 for wet pool\ncosts that SMUD avoided from 2004 to 2008. Id. Accordingly, the court awarded SMUD a total\nof $38,845,398 for the period between 1992 and 2009. Id. The parties filed cross-appeals.\n\n        On June 20, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims erred by applying an offset for the 2004–2009 damages\nperiod, to an earlier final judgment for the 1992–2003 damages period. See Sacramento Mun. Util.\nDist. v. United States, 566 F. App’x 985, 997 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (“SMUD IX”).\nAccordingly, the appellate court reversed the combined judgment of $38,845,398 for the 1992–\n2009 period and reinstated the prior $53,159,863 award for mitigation costs incurred between 1992\nand 2003. Id. at 986. Moreover, the appellate court vacated the damages award for 2004 to 2009\nand remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of SMUD’s argument that, in light of the\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fStandard Contract’s “Exchanges” provision, SMUD’s SNF would have been entirely removed\nbefore January 1, 2004, in the non-breach world.9\n\n        On remand, the court determined that, in the non-breach world, DOE would have removed\nall of Rancho Seco’s SNF by January 1, 2004. See Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist. v. United States,\n120 Fed. Cl. 278, 279 (2015) (“SMUD X”). And, SMUD was entitled to $20,703,595 in mitigation\ncosts for the period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2009. Id. at 282. In addition, the\ncourt awarded SMUD an additional $1,816,964 for various other fees. Id.\n\n       C.      Sacramento Municipal Utility District v. United States, Civil Action Docket No.\n               15-577C.10\n\n        On June 8, 2015, SMUD filed a Complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims in\nthis case, Civil Action Docket No. 15-577C, alleging a partial breach of the Standard Contract\n(6/8/2015 Compl. at ¶ 28) and seeking “damages incurred beginning January 1, 2010 and\ncontinuing through a date prior to trial, at least through June 1, 2015.” 6/8/2015 Compl. at ¶ 13.\nOn July 30, 2015, the Government filed an Answer (7/30/2015 Answer). ECF No. 7.\n\n         On September 21, 2015, the parties filed a Joint Preliminary Status Report, proposing two\ndifferent discovery schedules. ECF No. 8. On October 5, 2015, the court convened a Status\nConference to discuss a schedule acceptable to both parties. ECF No. 10. On October 28, 2015,\nthe court issued a Scheduling Order, that set the close of fact discovery for June 17, 2016 and a\ntrial date for October 2016. ECF No. 11.\n\n       On April 5, 2016, the Government filed a Motion To Extend Discovery And Stay Certain\nDeadlines, that SMUD opposed. ECF No. 15. On April 13, 2016, the court convened a Status\nConference to address the April 5, 2016 Motion. ECF No. 17. On April 18, 2016, the court issued\nan Amended Scheduling Order, denying the Government’s request to stay certain deadlines, but\nextending discovery until July 18, 2016. ECF No. 18. The court also scheduled trial for October\n4–6, 2016, in Washington, D.C. ECF No. 18.\n\n        On July 29, 2016, SMUD submitted a Witness List and Exhibit List. ECF Nos. 22–23. On\nthat same day, SMUD filed a Memorandum Of Contentions Of Fact And Law, to advise the court\nthat SMUD claimed $29,555,559 in damages, of which the Government did not dispute\n$22,508,343. ECF No. 24. SMUD also filed a Motion For Partial Summary Judgment, pursuant\n\n       9\n          The “Exchanges” provision gave utilities the option to exchange or swap acceptance slots\nto adjust delivery schedules, subject to the approval of DOE. See SMUD IX, 566 F. App’x at 987.\n       10\n         The underlying facts in Docket No. 15-577C were set forth in SMUD III, SMUD IV,\nSMUD VIII, and SMUD X. The relevant facts described herein were derived from: the June 8,\n2015 Complaint (“6/8/2015 Compl.”); the July 30, 2015 Answer (“7/30/2015 Answer”); evidence\nadduced at a trial that took place from October 4–5, 2016 in Washington, D.C. (“TR at 1–352”);\nSMUD’s exhibits, introduced during trial (“PX 1–53,” “PD 1–13, 101–105”); and the\nGovernment’s exhibits, introduced during trial (“DX 1–73”).\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fto Rule of the United States Court of Federal Claims (“RCFC”) 56, arguing that the court should\ngrant SMUD summary judgment as to the $22,508,343 claimed by SMUD and not disputed by the\nGovernment (“Pl. Mot.”). ECF No. 25.\n\n        On August 15, 2016, the Government filed a Response to the July 29, 2016 Motion For\nPartial Summary Judgment, confirming that the Government did not contest $22,362,864 of the\ndamages SMUD claimed (“Gov’t Resp.”). ECF No. 27. But, the Government argued that the\ncourt can only enter a partial judgment when, “an action presents more than one claim for relief.”\nGov’t Resp. at 2. In this case, however, the disputed and undisputed damages constitute a single\nclaim for relief. Gov’t Resp. at 2. Therefore, the court is required as a matter of law, to deny the\nJuly 29, 2016 Motion For Partial Summary Judgment. Gov’t Resp. at 2.\n\n        On August 15, 2016, the Government also filed a Motion To Modify the April 18, 2016\nScheduling Order. ECF No. 29. On August 19, 2016, the court denied the Government’s Motion\nto modify the April 18, 2016 Scheduling Order. On that same day, the Government filed a Witness\nList, Exhibit List, and Memorandum Of Contentions Of Fact And Law. ECF Nos. 31–33.\n\n         On September 8, 2016, SMUD filed a Reply in support of its July 29, 2016 Motion For\nPartial Summary Judgment, arguing that the Government’s definition of a “claim” is overly\nrestrictive, elevating form over substance (“Pl. Reply”). ECF No. 37. On September 14, 2016,\nthe Government filed an Amended Exhibit List, correcting the dates and descriptions of several\nexhibits. ECF No. 40.\n\n         On September 28, 2017, the court issued a Pretrial Order, instructing the parties to file the\nwritten direct examination testimony of their expert witnesses on the next day. ECF No. 41.\nPursuant to the Pretrial Order, on September 29, 2016, the parties filed the written direct testimony\nof their experts. ECF Nos. 42–43. On September 30, 2016, SMUD filed an Amended Exhibit List\nand, on October 3, 2016, a Second Amended Exhibit List. ECF Nos. 44–45.\n\n       On October 4–5, 2016, the court held a trial to determine the damages that SMUD incurred\nbetween January 1, 2010 and June 31, 2016, due to DOE’s ongoing partial breach of contract.\nECF Nos. 52, 54. During trial, the court instructed each party to submit supplemental briefing\nregarding SMUD’s July 29, 2016 Motion For Partial Summary Judgment. TR at 24. On October\n7, 2016, the Government filed a Supplemental Brief (“Gov’t Supp. Br.”). ECF No. 46.\n\n       On October 11, 2016, the Government filed a Second Amended Exhibit List. ECF. No.\n47. On October 19, 2016, SMUD filed a Third Amended Exhibit List. ECF No. 48. On October\n20, 2016, SMUD filed a Response to the October 7, 2016 Supplemental Brief (“Pl. Supp. Br.”).\nECF No. 49.\n\n       On November 14, 2016, SMUD filed a Post Trial Brief (“Pl. Post Tr. Br.”). ECF No. 55.\nAnd, on December 9, 2016, the Government filed a Post Trial Response Brief (“Gov’t Post Tr.\nResp.”). ECF No. 56. On December 23, 2016, SMUD filed a Reply to the Government’s\nDecember 9, 2016 Post-Trial Brief (“Pl. Post Tr. Reply”). ECF No. 57.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fII.    DISCUSSION.\n\n       A.      Jurisdiction.\n\n        The United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1491, “to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the\nConstitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any\nexpress or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in\ncases not sounding in tort.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) (emphasis added). The Tucker Act, however,\nis “a jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United\nStates for money damages. . . . [T]he Act merely confers jurisdiction upon [the United States\nCourt of Federal Claims] whenever the substantive right exists.” United States v. Testan, 424 U.S.\n392, 398 (1976). To pursue a substantive right under the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify and\nplead an independent contractual relationship, constitutional provision, federal statute and/or\nexecutive agency regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages. See\nTodd v. United States, 386 F.3d 1091, 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (emphasis added). In a breach of\ncontract case, “the money-mandating requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction normally is satisfied\nby the presumption that money damages are available for breach of contract, with no further\ninquiry being necessary.” Holmes v. United States, 657 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2011).\n\n        In this case, the June 8, 2015 Complaint alleges that: (1) SMUD entered into an express\ncontract with DOE on June 14, 1983; (2) DOE breached, and continues to breach, the June 14,\n1983 Contract; and (3) SMUD is entitled to damages for the ongoing breach. 6/8/2015 Compl. at\n¶¶ 1, 13, 28. Because SMUD’s claims are based on the alleged breach of a contractual relationship\nwith the Government, the court has determined that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate those claims.\nSee Holmes, 657 F.3d at 1314.\n\n       B.      Standing.\n\n        The United States Supreme Court has held that “the question of standing is whether the\nlitigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.”\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). Standing must be determined “as of the\ncommencement of suit[.]” Rothe Dev. Corp. v. Dep’t of Def., 413 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir.\n2005) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 570 n.5, (1992)). “The party invoking\nfederal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing [standing].” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\n\n       To establish standing to sue the Government for breach of contract, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate privity of contract with the Government. See Anderson v. United States, 344 F.3d\n1343, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“To have standing to sue the sovereign on a contract claim, a plaintiff\nmust be in privity of contract with the United States.”). In other words, the contract in question\nmust be between the plaintiff and the Government. See Ransom v. United States, 900 F.2d 242,\n244 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (“To maintain a cause of action pursuant to the Tucker Act that is based on a\ncontract, the contract must be between the plaintiff and the [G]overnment.”).\n\n       In this case, it is undisputed that SMUD was a signatory and intended beneficiary of the\nJune 14, 1983 Standard Contract. 7/30/2015 Answer at ¶ 1 (“[The Government] [a]dmits that in\n1983, SMUD entered into a standard contract . . . for the disposal of [SNF] and/or [HLW], by\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f[DOE].”). Therefore, the court has determined that SMUD is in privity of contract with the\nGovernment. Accordingly, SMUD has standing to pursue the breach of contract claim alleged in\nthe June 8, 2015 Complaint.\n\n       C.      Whether DOE Partially Breached The June 14, 1983 Standard Contract.\n\n        “Failure to perform a contractual duty when it is due is a breach of the contract.” Winstar\nCorp. v. United States, 64 F.3d 1531, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1995), aff’d 518 U.S. 839 (1996). The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the Standard Contract that DOE\nentered into with SMUD and other nuclear-utility plants, under the NWPA, required DOE to\n“dispose of the [plants’ SNF and HLW] beginning no later than January 31, 1998.” Maine Yankee\nAtomic Power, 225 F.3d at 1337 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the parties do\nnot dispute that, to date, “DOE has failed to begin disposing of SNF” and that, “SMUD [has] paid\nall required fees on time and in full.” 7/30/2015 Answer at ¶ 2. Therefore, the court has determined\nthat DOE partially breached the June 14, 1983 Standard Contract. Cf. Maine Yankee Atomic\nPower, 225 F.3d at 1343 (“[T]he parties do not dispute that [plaintiff] has paid all the contract fees\nand . . . that DOE has not begun accepting, transporting, and disposing of [plaintiff’s] SNF.\nAccordingly, DOE has breached the contract.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       D.      The Mitigation Costs That SMUD Is Entitled To As Damages, Because Of\n               DOE’s Partial Breach Of The June 14, 1983 Standard Contract.\n\n        In a suit for partial breach of contract, a plaintiff may recover damages that it already\nincurred. See Ind. Mich. Power Co. v. United States, 422 F.3d 1369, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (“[A]\nclaimant may not recover . . . prospective damages for anticipated future nonperformance resulting\nfrom the same partial breach.”). Breach of contract damages must be “sufficient to place the\ninjured party in as good a position as it would have been had the breaching party fully performed.”\nId. at 1373. But, “[the] non-breaching party should not be placed in a better position through the\naward of damages than if there had been no breach.” Bluebonnet Sav. Bank, F.S.B. v. United\nStates, 339 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\n        Breach of contract damages are “recoverable where: (1) the damages were reasonably\nforeseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting; (2) the breach is a substantial causal\nfactor in the damages;11 and (3) the damages are shown with reasonable certainty.” Ind. Mich.\nPower Co., 422 F.3d at 1373. The plaintiff must establish each element by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Energy Capital Corp. v. United States, 302 F.3d 1314, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2002). If\ndamages are hard to estimate, however, “the burden of imprecision does not fall on the innocent\nparty.” LaSalle Talman Bank v. United States, 317 F.3d 1363, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n       11\n           The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit prefers the “but for” causation\ntest—whether the breach of contract was the but-for cause of plaintiff’s damages—over the\n“substantial factor” causation test—whether the breach was a substantial factor in causing\nplaintiff’s damages. See Yankee Atomic, 536 F.3d at 1272. Nonetheless, the appellate court has\nrefrained “from reversing trial courts that [apply] the substantial factor test in . . . SNF cases.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f        To assess damages in cases arising out of DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract,\nthe court must perform a “comparison between the breach and non-breach worlds.” Yankee Atomic\nElec. Co. v. United States, 536 F.3d 1268, 1273 (2008). As part of this comparison, the\nGovernment “must move forward by pointing out the costs it believes the [nuclear utility] plaintiff\navoided because of [DOE’s] breach[.]” S. Nuclear Operating Co. v. United States, 637 F.3d 1297,\n1304 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The nuclear utility-party, however, bears the burden of persuasion with\nrespect both to claimed costs and avoided costs. Id. Therefore, “a plaintiff seeking damages must\nsubmit a hypothetical model establishing what its costs would have been in the absence of breach.”\nEnergy Nw. v. United States, 641 F.3d 1300, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2011); see also S. Nuclear, 637 F.3d\nat 1304 (“[B]ecause plaintiffs . . . are seeking expectancy damages, it is incumbent upon them to\nestablish a plausible ‘but-for’ world.”) (quoting Yankee Atomic, 536 F.3d at 1273) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n        “If a cost would have been incurred even in the non-breach world, it is not recoverable.”\nEnergy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1307. Likewise, a cost that would have been incurred in the non-breach\nworld, but was not incurred in the actual world—i.e., an avoided cost—must be offset against a\nplaintiff’s recovery. See Carolina Power & Light Co. v. United States, 573 F.3d 1271, 1277 (Fed.\nCir. 2009) (differentiating between “avoided” and “deferred” costs).\n\n        In this case, SMUD seeks $29,549,558 in damages for mitigation costs incurred from\nJanuary 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015, caused by DOE’s ongoing breach of the Standard Contract. Pl.\nPost Tr. Br. at 1. The Government objects only to $7,041,215 of that amount, because SMUD did\nnot carry its burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that SMUD is entitled to\ncosts associated with:\n\n               maintenance of the Training and Records (T&R),12 and Personnel Access Portal\n                (“PAP”)13 buildings;\n               site consolidation, upgrades to the PAP building’s water and septic systems, and\n                planning to replace the ISFSI backup generator;\n               replacing the PAP building’s heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (“HVAC”),\n                and carpets;\n               replacing the ISFSI’s backup generator, and refurbishing certain parts of Rancho\n                Seco’s electrical infrastructure;\n\n\n\n       12\n         The T&R building, a five-story building constructed in the 1980s, housed offices for\nthree Rancho Seco staff members and twenty security guards. TR at 64–65 (Testimony of Mr.\nEinar Ronningen).\n       13\n          The PAP building was “repurposed from an existing security building to become the\nmain office building, providing work space for all on-site non-security personnel, support space\nfor the on-site security personnel, as well as a location for a qualified vault for site records.” PX\n52 at 25 (Written Direct Testimony of Mr. Kenneth P. Metcalfe).\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f               maintenance of the Interim Onsite Storage Building (“IOSB”)14 and refurbishing\n                the fuel handling equipment stored in the IOSB;\n               American Nuclear Insurers (“ANI”) insurance brokerage fees; and\n               ANI Premium Costs.\n\nGov’t Post Tr. Br. at 9, 18, 20, 24.\n\n                1.     Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred To Maintain\n                       And Operate The T&R Building And PAP Building.\n\n                         a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n       SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $3,685,112 for maintenance of the T&R and\nPAP buildings from 2010 to 2015, because these costs are attributable to the presence of SNF at\nRancho Seco. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 6–7. The court has determined in prior litigation that, in the non-\nbreach world, DOE would have removed all of SMUD’s SNF by 2004 and SMUD would have\ncompletely exited the nuclear industry by 2009. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 2. For these reasons, the court\nawarded SMUD maintenance and operations costs in Civil Action Docket No. 09-587C, and\nshould do so again in this case. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 6.\n\n         The evidence adduced at trial proves that SMUD’s site operations costs are attributable to\nDOE’s ongoing failure to remove Rancho Seco’s SNF. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 7. Mr. Ronningen15\ntestified that SMUD’s site operations costs were related to operating and maintaining facilities\nused by personnel that support SNF storage. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 8. These costs were “required\nbecause of the presence of the spent nuclear fuel and the staff [at Rancho Seco] safely managing\nit.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 7 (quoting TR at 61–62, 85 (Ronningen)).\n\n      At trial, the Government did not refute Mr. Ronningen’s testimony. In fact, the\nGovernment’s expert witness, Mr. Warren Brewer,16 agreed that it is necessary to have security\n\n       14\n          “[T]he IOSB was used to store contaminated spent fuel handling equipment, which\nSMUD maintains for use in ongoing spent fuel transfer campaigns, and which SMUD intends to\nuse to move spent fuel during SMUD’s Part 72 relicensing process, if necessary.” PX 52 at 22–\n23 (Metcalfe). Moreover, SMUD stored Class B and Class C waste in the IOSB until 2014. PX\n52 at 23 (Metcalfe).\n       15\n         Mr. Einar Ronningen is SMUD’s senior representative at the Rancho Seco site. TR at\n41. In that capacity, he is responsible for the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel. TR at 41\n(Ronningen).\n       16\n           Mr. Warren Keith Brewer is the President of ABZ, Incorporated, an engineering\nconsulting company. TR at 232. Mr. Brewer has a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical\nengineering from Louisiana Tech University and a Masters of Science degree in nuclear\nengineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. TR at 233. In addition, Mr. Brewer\nhas taken graduate-level courses at the Bettis Reactor Engineering School. TR at 233. Mr. Brewer\n\n\n                                                13\n\fpersonnel and management employees to guard and manage the SNF stored at Rancho Seco, and\nthey need office space that must be maintained. TR at 243 (Brewer). Mr. Brewer also agreed that\nthe costs of maintaining the nuclear records vault and the security gate at the entrance of the\nRancho Seco site are attributable to the presence of SNF. TR at 246–47 (Brewer).\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n         The Government challenges $3,663,129 of the costs claimed by SMUD for maintenance\nand operation of the T&R building and PAP building, because those facilities support personnel\nthat perform non-nuclear activities at Rancho Seco. Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 9–10. Therefore, the\nmaintenance of these buildings is not related to DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract.\nGov’t Post Tr. Br. at 9. In addition, SMUD did not “prove the extent to which [its] incurred costs\ndiffer from the costs [it] would have incurred in the non-breach world,” because SMUD failed to\npresent evidence of what its maintenance and operations costs would have been if DOE performed\non the Standard Contract. Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 11 (citing Energy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1306). Mr.\nRonningen testified that SMUD’s claim includes costs that “he determined had any connection,\neither directly or indirectly, to the presence of [SNF at Rancho Seco].” Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 12.\nBut, Mr. Ronningen failed to consider whether costs for the same or similar activities would have\nbeen incurred if DOE had disposed of SMUD’s SNF by 2004. Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 12.\n\n       Moreover, to the extent that SMUD argues that “it has satisfied its causation burden\nbecause . . . no buildings or personnel would be located at the Rancho Seco Industrial Facility in\nthe non-breach world, its argument conflicts with SMUD’s continued [use] of the site for non-\nSNF-related activities.” Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 14. As Mr. Ronningen testified, in the non-breach\nworld, SMUD’s switchyard17 and solar power plant, Western Area Power Administration’s\n(“WAPA”)18 communications equipment, and the Cosumnes Gas-fired Power Plant would still be\nlocated at Rancho Seco. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 14 (citing TR at 140, 144, 171 (Ronningen)).\n\n\n\nhas worked in the nuclear industry for over forty years. TR at 232. He began his nuclear career\nwith the United States Navy, as an employee of the Division of Labor Reactors. TR at 233. After\nten years, he moved to a consulting company named Picard, Lowe and Garrick. TR at 234. Mr.\nBrewer left Picard, Lowe and Garrick to begin ABZ, Incorporated. TR at 234. In his work as a\nnuclear engineering consultant, the United States Court of Federal Claims has qualified Mr.\nBrewer as an expert in nuclear engineering and nuclear decommissioning. TR at 239. During\ntrial, the Government proffered Mr. Brewer as an expert in nuclear engineering—that includes\nSNF management, nuclear power plant systems, NRC regulations, and nuclear power plant\nmodifications—as well as nuclear decommissioning. TR at 241. SMUD did not object to Mr.\nBrewer’s qualifications. TR at 241. Accordingly, the court has determined that Mr. Brewer is an\nexpert in his respective field and qualified to testify as such. See Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n       17\n         The switchyard is the “infrastructure that was installed to take the electricity that Rancho\nSeco generated and put it on the distribution grid.” TR at 119 (Ronningen).\n       18\n         WAPA is an agency within the United States Department of Energy that transmits and\nsells hydropower across fifteen central and western states.

SMUD’s Reply.\n\n        SMUD replies that the evidence presented at trial established that, in the non-breach world,\nSMUD would not have incurred maintenance and operation costs for the T&R building and PAP\nbuilding from 2010 to 2015. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 3. Mr. Ronningen testified that Rancho Seco is\nno longer a functioning power plant, so the only employees located there are nuclear staff. Pl. Post\nTr.

Reply at 5 (citing TR at 69 (Ronningen)). This evidence demonstrates that,\nin the non-breach world, SMUD would not have incurred costs to maintain the T&R building and\nPAP building.\n\n                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Causation is an issue of fact that plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence.\nSee Energy Capital, 302 F.3d at 1332 (“In contract cases, causation, foreseeability, and certainty\nare questions of fact.”); id. at 1325 (instructing that plaintiff must prove causation by a\npreponderance of the evidence to recover expectancy damages in a breach of contract claim). In\ncases arising out of DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract, causation requires the court to\ncompare the breach world with a hypothetical non-breach world. See Yankee Atomic, 536 F.3d at\n1273. Plaintiff is entitled to recover only those costs that (1) were caused by DOE’s breach, Energy\nCapital, 302 F.3d at 1325, and (2) Plaintiff would not have incurred in the non-breach world,\nEnergy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1307.\n\n        The Government argues that SMUD is not entitled to recover costs incurred to maintain\nthe T&R and PAP buildings, because those costs benefit SMUD’s non-nuclear business objectives\nand provide only incidental benefits to the storage of SNF. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In other\nwords, SMUD has failed to establish that its claimed costs are attributable to the continued\npresence of SNF at Rancho Seco. The weight of the evidence, however, cuts against the\nGovernment’s argument. At trial, Mr. Ronningen testified that in 2010 the T&R building\ncontained offices for nuclear staff and security officers, responsible for guarding Rancho Seco’s\nSNF. TR at 65 (Ronningen). No one else occupied the building. TR at 65 (Ronningen). After\n2010, the nuclear staff and security officers were transferred to the PAP building. TR at 67–68\n(Ronningen). The PAP building housed only these employees. TR at 81 (Ronningen). At the\ntime of the move, SMUD stopped maintaining the T&R building and, in 2015, demolished it. TR\nat 81, 86 (Ronningen).\n\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATION HISTORY, https://www.wapa.gov/About/history/Pages/History.aspx (last visited\nFeb. 23, 2017).\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f        The Government did not produce affirmative evidence to rebut Mr. Ronningen’s testimony.\nBut, during cross-examination, Mr. Ronningen admitted that the PAP building served as a\ncheckpoint for the entire Rancho Seco complex and that non-nuclear personnel sometimes passed\nthrough there. TR at 167 (Ronningen). The witness, however, clarified that the PAP building\nlikely remained a checkpoint, because the nuclear staff and security officers were located there.\nTR at 167 (Ronningen). In the non-breach world, the PAP building would have been unoccupied.\nTR at 81 (Ronningen). Moreover, the Government’s own witness admitted that costs for\nmaintaining and operating offices for Rancho Seco’s nuclear staff and security force are\nattributable to DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract. TR at 246–47 (Brewer). Therefore,\nthe court has determined that SMUD established that the costs incurred to maintain and operate\nthe T&R and PAP buildings are attributable to the continued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco.\n\n        In addition, SMUD has established that it would not have incurred costs to maintain and\noperate the T&R and PAP buildings in the non-breach world. Mr. Ronningen testified that the\nT&R building was occupied only by nuclear staff. TR at 65 (Ronningen). And, that virtually all\nof the costs associated with maintaining and operating the T&R building seized after those\nemployees moved out. TR at 86 (Ronningen). In fact, SMUD demolished the T&R building a\nshort time after the nuclear staff was transferred to the PAP building. TR at 81 (Ronningen). The\nGovernment did not rebut this testimony. Instead, Mr. Brewer admitted that the presence of SNF\nat Rancho Seco made it necessary to have nuclear staff and security personnel onsite. TR at 243\n(Brewer). And, that these employees need offices with functioning lights, heating and ventilation,\nrunning water, bathrooms, computers and internets access, and fire safety equipment. TR at 244–\n45 (Brewer). In other words, the nuclear staff requires an operational office building and that\noffice building must be maintained. Based on the testimony of Mr. Ronningen and Mr. Brewer,\nthe court has determined that, in the non-breach world, SMUD would not have incurred costs to\nmaintain and operate the T&R building after 2004, when all of Rancho Seco’s SNF would have\nbeen removed.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen also testified that the PAP building would have been unoccupied in the\nnon-breach world. TR at 81 (Ronningen). In addition, the PAP building does not provide any\nsupport to SMUD’s Backup Control Center (“BCC”), 19 switchyard or solar power plant. TR at\n119, 121 (Ronningen). The Government produced evidence that the PAP building serves as a\nsecurity checkpoint for the entire Rancho Seco facility. TR at 167 (Ronningen). But, as mentioned\nabove, Mr. Ronningen explained that the PAP building only served as a de facto checkpoint,\nbecause the nuclear staff and security personnel are already located there. TR at 167 (Ronningen).\nTherefore, the court has determined that in the non-breach world, SMUD would not have incurred\ncosts to maintain and operate the PAP building.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n          “SMUD maintains a backup control center at [Rancho Seco], which ensures that in the\nevent of an emergency at SMUD’s headquarters in downtown Sacramento . . . the utility will still\nbe able to operate its grid and provide power to its customers.” TR at 27–28 (Ronningen).\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $3,685,112\nfor costs incurred to maintain and operate the T&R and PAP buildings from January 1, 2010 to\nJune 30, 2015.\n\n               2.     Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred For Site\n                      Consolidation, Upgrades To The PAP Building’s Water And Septic\n                      Systems, And Planning To Replace The ISFSI Backup Generator.\n\n                        a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n       SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $698,255 for site consolidation costs, because\nthose costs are attributable to DOE’s partial breach of the June 14, 1983 Standard Contract and are\nreasonable. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 13. Specifically, SMUD claims $567,505 for costs incurred moving\nRancho Seco’s nuclear staff from the T&R building to the PAP building and $126,114 for work\ndone to the PAP building’s water and septic systems after the move. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 13–14.\nSMUD also claims $4,637 for planning that was necessary to replace the ISFSI backup generator,\nrequired by NRC regulations. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 13–14.\n\n        SMUD’s site consolidation effort, and water and septic upgrades are attributable to the\npresence of SNF at Rancho Seco. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 18. And, these efforts reduced SMUD’s\noperation costs from 2010 to 2015. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 18. In addition, SMUD should recover the\ncost of planning to replace the ISFSI backup generator, because SMUD was required to have a\nbackup generator for the ISFSI. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 14 (citing DX 73 at ¶ 27 (Brewer)).\n\n                        b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n       The Government challenges the $698,255 claimed by SMUD for site consolidation,\nupgrades to the PAP building’s water and septic systems, and planning to replace the ISFSI backup\ngenerator, as they were incurred to improve infrastructure that provides support to Rancho Seco’s\nnon-nuclear business. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In addition, SMUD did not “prove the extent\nto which [its] incurred costs differ from the costs [it] would have incurred in the non-breach\nworld.” Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 11 (citing Energy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1306).\n\n                        c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n        SMUD replies that the purpose of the site consolidation project was to “to move the staff\noverseeing the nuclear fuel from the large, aging T&R building to the smaller PAP building in\norder to save operations and maintenance expenses.” Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 8 (citing TR at 68, 78–\n81 (Ronningen); PX 20 (Site Consolidation Presentation)). SMUD upgraded the PAP building’s\nwater and septic systems to reduce operating expenses. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 8 (citing TR at 73–\n74 (Ronningen); see also PX 20.013–20.014). If DOE had removed the SNF from Rancho Seco\nby 2004, SMUD would not have needed to consolidate the T&R and PAP buildings, or upgraded\nthe water and septic systems. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 9 (citing TR at 81 (Ronningen)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen testified that he prepared SMUD’s damages claim and that his objective\nthroughout that process was “[t]o capture the costs associated with the presence of spent nuclear\nfuel at Rancho Seco.” TR at 48 (Ronningen). In determining what costs to include in the claim,\nMr. Ronningen “evaluat[ed] [] the work that was done . . . and ma[de] a reasonable assumption\nand a conservative assumption about how much of [those] costs were directly related to the\npresence of spent nuclear fuel.” TR at 51–52 (Ronningen). The Government argues that this\ntestimony demonstrates that Mr. Ronningen did not consider whether costs related to site\nconsolidation, upgrades to the PAP building’s water and septic systems, and planning to replace\nthe ISFSI backup generator would have been incurred in the non-breach world. Gov’t Post Tr. Br.\nat 12.\n\n       During the trial, however, SMUD presented credible evidence of the non-breach world,\ndemonstrating that SMUD would not have consolidated the T&R and PAP buildings, upgraded\nthe water and septic system in the PAP building, or replaced the ISFSI’s backup generator if DOE\nhad performed on the Standard Contract. Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have\n“done the consolidation from the T&R building to the PAP building if the spent fuel was gone by\n2004[.]” TR at 81 (Ronningen). He also testified that SMUD would not have needed a septic\nsystem or new drinking water system in Rancho Seco if DOE had removed the SNF. TR at 78\n(Ronningen). Finally, Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have purchased the ISFSI\nbackup generator if the SNF was offsite. TR at 100 (Ronningen). Moreover, the generator did not\nprovide ancillary benefits to any other equipment at Rancho Seco, except for some WAPA\ninstruments. TR at 99 (Ronningen). But, in the non-breach world, those instruments would be\nlocated in the switchyard and connected to a separate generator. TR at 163, 217 (Ronningen).\n\n        The Government’s expert witness, Mr. Brewer, testified that “SMUD has not explained\nhow the site modifications or consolidation efforts have been influenced by the presence of\npersonnel remaining on the site for decommissioning or other functions not needed for the\ncontinued storage of spent nuclear fuel.” DX 72 at ¶ 42 (Brewer). But, this testimony is inaccurate.\nAt trial, SMUD presented evidence that, after consolidation, only nuclear staff and security\npersonnel had offices in the PAP building. TR at 81 (Ronningen). And, the PAP building did not\nprovide support to other Rancho Seco buildings. TR at TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). In addition,\nMr. Ronningen testified that the SMUD employees who worked on the BCC, switchyard and solar\npower plant were not permanently stationed at Rancho Seco. TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). Instead,\nthey worked from SMUD headquarters and visited the site a few times per year to check on\nequipment. TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). Finally, Mr. Ronningen knew that non-nuclear staff\nperiodically visited Rancho Seco, but he nevertheless testified that the site consolidation project\nwould not have occurred but-for the required presence of nuclear staff and security onsite. TR at\n81, 164 (Ronningen). Combined, this evidence demonstrates that the presence of non-nuclear staff\nat Rancho Seco did not impact the site consolidation project.\n\n       Mr. Brewer also testified that SMUD failed to explain why its decision to consolidate the\nT&R and PAP buildings in 2010 was attributable to the continued presence of SNF at Rancho\nSeco, given that all of Rancho Seco’s SNF had been in dry storage since 2002 and the activities\nneeded to store the SNF had remained static for several years. DX 72 at ¶ 41 (Brewer). But, Mr.\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fRonningen testified that Rancho Seco’s nuclear staff was greatly reduced when SMUD completed\nthe decommissioning process in 2008. TR at 67 (Ronningen). In fact, by the end of 2010, SMUD’s\nnuclear staff had been reduced from “about a dozen” to three. TR at 65 (Ronningen). It made\nlittle sense for three people to occupy an entire building, especially a thirty-year old one with five\nstories and an aging HVAC. TR at 66–67 (Ronningen). It is undisputed, however, that the\ncontinued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco required SMUD to maintain some nuclear staff onsite.\nTR at 243 (Brewer) (“Q. You agree that it’s necessary to have people to manage the spent fuel,\nright? A. I do. Q. And it’s necessary to have security personnel to guard the fuel, correct? A. It\nis. Q. SMUD needs staff like Mr. Ronningen to work with the NRC to ensure compliance, right?\nA. They need some level of staff to ensure compliance, that’s correct.”). It is also undisputed that\nthe nuclear staff needs offices to work in. TR at 244 (Brewer) (“So, you do agree that SMUD\nneeds a building for the security staff to work in, Mr. Brewer, right? A. Just -- I do, just as any\nother people that are on the site need somewhere to do their work.”). This testimony demonstrates\nthat SMUD’s decision to consolidate the T&R and PAP building in 2010 was attributable to the\ncontinued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco.\n\n       For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to $698,255 for cost\nincurred for Site Consolidation, upgrades to the PAP building’s water and septic systems, and\nplanning to replace the ISFSI backup generator.\n\n               3.      Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred To Replace The\n                       HVAC Unit And Install New Carpet In The PAP Building.\n\n                         a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $452,899, incurred to replace the PAP building’s\nfailing HVAC unit. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19. The PAP building houses nuclear personnel and a\nnuclear records vault, that must be maintained onsite due to the continued presence of SNF at\nRancho Seco. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 20. The vault and personnel housed in the PAP building require\nadequate heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19–20. The PAP building’s\noriginal HVAC unit was installed in the 1980s. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19 (citing TR at 104\n(Ronningen)). In 2015, when SMUD decided to replace it, the old equipment was antiquated and\nfailing. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19 (citing TR at 104–05 (Ronningen)).\n\n        SMUD also argues that it is entitled to recover $28,308 because “[i]t was eminently\nreasonable for SMUD to install carpet in the PAP building to prepare the PAP to serve as the staff\noffice building.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 20 (citing TR at 82–83 (Ronningen)).\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n        The Government challenges SMUD’s claimed costs for installation of the PAP building’s\nnew HVAC unit and carpets, because these costs were incurred to improve infrastructure that\nprovides support to non-SNF workers. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In addition, the Government\nargues that SMUD did not “prove the extent to which [its] incurred costs differ from the costs [it]\nwould have incurred in the non-breach world.” Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 11 (citing Energy Nw., 641\nF.3d at 1306)).\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f                        c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n        SMUD replies that “[t]he Government presents no facts or evidence to dispute the causal\nconnection between [DOE’s] breach [of the Standard Contract] and the HVAC [and] carpet costs.”\nPl. Post Tr. Reply at 10. Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have moved the SNF staff\nto the PAP building, if DOE removed Rancho Seco’s SNF by 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 10 (citing\nTR at 81 (Ronningen)). And, if the PAP building would not have been occupied in the non-breach\nworld, then SMUD would not have needed to replace the HVAC unit and carpets in that building.\nPl. Post Tr. Reply at 10. Therefore, the costs that SMUD incurred to replace the HVAC unit and\ncarpets are due to DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract and the Government’s witnesses did not\noffer any evidence to rebut this conclusion. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 10.\n\n                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen testified that the PAP building did not provide support to other Rancho\nSeco buildings. TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). And, the nuclear staff and security were the only\nemployees located in the PAP building. TR at 81 (Ronningen). The Government did not present\nany evidence to the contrary. Therefore, SMUD established that the PAP building’s new HVAC\nunit and carpets do not benefit Rancho Seco’s non-nuclear activities.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen also testified that, in the non-breach world, the PAP building would not\nhave been occupied. TR at 81 (Ronningen). Therefore, SMUD would not have installed new\ncarpets in the building. And, the failing HVAC system would not have been replaced. TR at 106\n(Ronningen). The Government did not offer any specific evidence to rebut this testimony.\nAccordingly, SMUD has established that, in the non-breach world, it would not have incurred\ncosts to replace the PAP building’s HVAC unit and carpets.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $481,207 for\ncosts incurred to replace the HVAC unit and install new carpets in the PAP building.\n\n               4.      Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred To Replace The\n                       ISFSI Backup Generator And Refurbish Parts Of Rancho Seco’s\n                       Electrical Infrastructure.\n\n                        a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $573,214 for costs incurred to replace the diesel\ngenerator that provides backup power to the ISFSI and associated modification to the aging\nelectrical infrastructure that supports the ISFSI and the PAP building. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21. NRC\nregulations require SMUD to maintain a functioning backup generator for the ISFSI and the\nISFSI’s original backup generator reached the end of its useful life during the claim period. Pl.\nPost Tr. Br. at 21 (citing TR at 95–96, 99 (Ronningen)). Therefore, SMUD was required to\npurchase and install a new backup generator and associated switchgear to comply with NRC\nregulations. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21 (citing TR at 95–96, 99 (Ronningen)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f         Replacing the backup generator and switchgear involved “substantial work to design and\nimplement the integration of the new equipment into the existing electrical distribution system,\ninstall the new equipment, connect it to the distribution infrastructure, purchase project-related\ncabling and fencing, and establish a concrete pad on which to place the generator.” Pl. Post Tr.\nBr. at 21. Additionally, as part of the replacement process, SMUD updated the aging electrical\ninfrastructure that supplies power to the ISFSI and PAP building. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21. But,\nSMUD would not have replaced the backup generator or performed any of the related electrical\nwork, if DOE had removed all SMUD’s SNF by 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21–22.\n\n         The Government does not dispute that SMUD is entitled to recover the purchase price of\nthe backup generator and switchgear, but argues that the cost of installing that equipment should\nbe excluded from SMUD’s claim. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22. But, Mr. Brewer, their own expert,\ntestified “that the costs of installing the generator and switchgear are attributable to the SNF\nremaining onsite.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22 (citing TR at 257 (Brewer)). The “installation costs”\ninclude: “mounting the generator, connecting it to the fuel source, labor costs, and securing the\ngenerator with a fence.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22 (citing TR at 257 (Brewer)).\n\n        Mr. Ronningen’s testimony also demonstrates that SMUD replaced the ISFSI backup\ngenerator and performed improvements to the electrical infrastructure for the sole purpose of\nproviding backup power to Rancho Seco’s nuclear function. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 24. The\nGovernment argues that this claim includes “costs associated with site restoration,” such as “the\nre-feed of lighting power to the Turbine building, Chlorine building, and Warehouse/shops\nbuilding,” is mistaken. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22–23 (citing DX 73 at ¶ 52 (Brewer)). SMUD, however,\nonly worked on the electrical equipment in the turbine and chlorine buildings, because the existing\nelectrical distribution system passed through those facilities and it was less costly to refurbish the\nold equipment than to create a brand new system that avoided the two buildings entirely.

The Government’s Response.\n\n        The Government challenges $449,717 of SMUD’s claim for costs incurred replacing the\nbackup generator and refurbishing parts of Rancho Seco’s electrical infrastructure, because they\nwere incurred to improve infrastructure that provides support to non-nuclear activities at Rancho\nSeco. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In addition, SMUD did not “prove the extent to which [its]\nincurred costs differ from the costs [it] would have incurred in the non-breach world.” Gov’t Post\nTr.

Reply at 11 (citing TR at 97–99, 163 (Ronningen)).\n\n                         d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen testified that the backup generator does not provide any ancillary benefit\nto non-nuclear equipment, except certain WAPA instruments. TR at 99 (Ronningen). But, in the\nnon-breach world, those instruments would be located at the switchyard, which has a separate\nbackup generator. TR at 163, 217 (Ronningen). Moreover, SMUD’s upgrades to the electrical\nsystem do not benefit Rancho Seco’s non-nuclear functions. TR at 97, 98, 154, 162–63\n(Ronningen). As rebuttal evidence, the Government produced Mr. Brewer’s testimony that\nSMUD should not recover some of the costs incurred to upgrade the electrical system, because\nthose upgrades help support power distribution to buildings that have a non-nuclear function. DX\n73 at ¶ 52 (Brewer). Specifically, Mr. Brewer identified “the Turbine building, Chlorine building,\nand Warehouse/shops building.” DX 73 at ¶ 52 (Brewer). Mr. Ronningen, however, explained\nthat the Turbine and Chlorine buildings were not operational during the claim period. TR at 98\n(Ronningen) (“Q. Were the turbine building and chlorine building -- was that being used in any\nway during the claim period? A. No, there’s no functions that occur in there[.]”). Regarding the\nwarehouse, Mr. Ronningen testified that there may be some lighting in that building. TR at 154\n(Ronningen) (emphasis added). But, most of the material stored there is SNF handling equipment.\nTR at 221 (Ronningen). Therefore, SMUD has established that installation of the backup generator\nand associated upgrades to portions the electrical infrastructure, were not performed for the benefit\nof Rancho Seco’s non-nuclear functions.\n\n       Moreover, Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have purchased the backup\ngenerator or done any of the associated electrical work, if DOE had removed Rancho Seco’s SNF\nby 2004. TR at 100 (Ronningen). The Government does not dispute this testimony. In fact, on\ncross-examination, Mr. Brewer admitted that the cost of purchasing a new backup generator and\nswitchgear, and installing that equipment were attributable to the presence of SNF at Rancho Seco.\nTR at 256–57. Therefore, SMUD has established that, in the non-breach world, it would not: have\npurchased the ISFSI backup generator or switchgear; installed that equipment; or upgraded the\nrelevant portions of Rancho Seco’s electrical distribution infrastructure.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $573,214 for\ncosts incurred to replace the ISFSI backup generator and renovate parts of the electrical distribution\nsystem that supports the ISFSI and the PAP building.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f                 5.

SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD argues that it incurred $980,500 in costs for operating, maintaining and repairing\nthe IOSB, and refurbishing the spent fuel handling equipment stored there. Pl.

And, Mr. Brewer agreed that the presence of fuel handling equipment at Rancho\nSeco and the work necessary to maintain that equipment, were attributable to the presence of SNF.\nPl. Post Tr. Br. at 10 (citing TR at 254 (Brewer)).\n\n        In sum, as long as SNF is stored at Rancho Seco, it will be necessary for SMUD to store\nthe fuel handling equipment onsite, because an emergency may require the removal of an SNF\ncanister. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 9 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691). Additionally, SMUD is\npreparing to renew its ISFSI license, pursuant to 10 C.F.R. 72.20 And, as part of the relicensing\nprocess, the NRC may require SMUD to extract SNF canisters from the ISFSI.

Resp. at 18\n(citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691). Therefore, “in the non-breach world, SMUD would not\nhave refurbished the IOSB nor incurred operation and maintenance costs for the IOSB.” Gov’t\nPost Tr. Resp. at 18 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed.

In addition, the court determined\nthat, in the non-breach world, SMUD would not be required to maintain transfer equipment at\nRancho Seco, because SMUD’s SNF and HLW would have been removed by 2004. Gov’t Post\nTr. Resp. at 18 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691).\n\n        In this case, however, Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD removed all Class B and C\nwaste from Rancho Seco in 2014. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 19–20 (citing TR at 185 (Ronningen)).\nIn addition, Mr. Ronningen also testified that SMUD intended to decommission and dismantle the\nIOSB despite the continued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 20 (citing\nTR at 186 (Ronningen)). Moreover, during the current claim period, some of the SNF handling\nequipment, including the transfer cask and the hydraulic ram, was not stored in the IOSB. Gov’t\nPost Tr.

For these reasons, SMUD has failed to demonstrate that the\nplanning, operation, and maintenance of the IOSB were necessitated by the presence of SNF at\nRancho Seco or that the same circumstances justifying recovery of IOSB costs in Docket No. 09-\n587C exist in this case.

The installation of a new ISFSI building does not establish that SMUD’s\nprior use of the IOSB was inappropriate or unnecessary. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 13.\n\n                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n       The Government argues that DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract did not require\nSMUD to maintain the IOSB, because Rancho Seco’s Class B and C waste was removed by 2014,\nsome of the handling equipment was not stored in the IOSB during the entire claim period, and\nSMUD transferred the handling equipment to a permanent building within the ISFSI in 2015.\nGov’t Post Tr. Br. at 19–20. It is unclear whether the Government is arguing that: (1) SMUD’s\ncontinued use of the IOSB was not caused by the DOE’s partial breach; or (2) it was unreasonable\nfor SMUD to continue using the IOSB under the circumstances. Either way, the Government’s\nargument is not persuasive.\n\n        Regarding causation, the DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract was a substantial\nfactor in, if not the but-for cause of, SMUD’s use of the IOSB from 2010 to 2015. During that\ntime period, the IOSB was used to store Class B and C waste, and contaminated fuel handling\nequipment. TR at 57, 185. Mr. Ronningen, however, testified that SMUD would not have used\nthe IOSB from 2010 to 2015 if DOE had performed under the Standard Contract. TR at 60\n(Ronningen). The Government did not refute this testimony. In fact, Mr. Brewer agreed that\nSMUD would not have used the IOSB to store handling equipment, “because there would have\nbeen none.” TR at 254 (Brewer). And, refused to provide any opinion on whether the IOSB would\nhave been used to store Class B and C waste. TR at 254 (Brewer) (“Q. [Y]ou are not offering an\nopinion in this case that the B and C waste would have been onsite [after] 2009, is that correct?\nA. No, I’m not.”). In light of the Government’s failure to refute Mr. Ronningen’s testimony, the\ncourt has found that SMUD would not have operated the IOSB during the claim period if DOE\nremoved Rancho Seco’s SNF by 2004. In other words, DOE’s breach is the but-for cause of\nSMUD’s continued use of the IOSB.\n\n        Regarding reasonableness, a party that is mitigating damages from a breach is only required\nto “make those efforts that are fair and reasonable under the circumstances.” Home Savings of\nAm. v. United States, 399 F.3d 1341, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting Robinson v. United States, 305\nF.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed.Cir.2002)). The breaching party bears the burden of establishing that a\ncertain mitigation effort was unreasonable. See SMUD V, 293 F. App’x at 772 (“It is the\nGovernment’s burden to show that it was unreasonable for SMUD to pursue [certain efforts] to\nmitigate the Government’s breach); see also Tennessee Valley Auth. v. United States, 69 Fed. Cl.\n515, 523 (2006) (“[T]he government bears the burden of showing that [plaintiff’s] mitigation\nefforts were unreasonable.”).\n\n       In this case, the Government has not satisfied its burden of establishing that it was\nunreasonable for SMUD to store Class B and C waste, and fuel handling equipment in the IOSB.\nThe Government’s argument that it was not reasonable for SMUD to use the IOSB after it removed\nthe Class B and C waste from that building in 2014, is irrelevant for most of the claim period,\ncovering January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015. Moreover, SMUD was required to store contaminated\nhandling equipment in a licensed facility, such as the IOSB. TR at 59–60, 211 (Ronningen). And,\nthe equipment had to remain onsite, because an emergency might require the removal of an SNF\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\fcanister from the ISFSI. See SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691. Moreover, SMUD must relicense\nthe ISFSI in the near future and, as part of that process, the handling equipment will be required\nonsite to move SNF canisters. TR at 93 (Ronningen). Therefore, SMUD had the choice between\nconstructing a permanent facility to store the contaminated equipment at Rancho Seco and storing\nit in the preexisting IOSB. SMUD decided to store the equipment in the IOSB from 2010 to 2015.\nTR at 189. The Government does not explain how the reasonableness of this decision depends on\nthe presence of Class B and C waste in the IOSB.\n\n        In addition, SMUD’s decision to store uncontaminated equipment outside of the IOSB is\nirrelevant. Mr. Ronningen testified that the IOSB was necessary to house contaminated handling\nequipment, such as the failed fuel grapple and the lifting yoke. TR at 211 (Ronningen). And, all\ncontaminated equipment was stored inside the IOSB during the claim period, except temporarily\nwhen SMUD moved the equipment out of the way, so it could dispose of the Class B and C waste\nthat was also stored there. TR at 58–59 (Ronningen). Finally, the Government does not explain\nwhy SMUD’s transfer of the handling equipment to a new ISFSI building after the claim period is\nrelevant to the reasonableness of SMUD’s use of the IOSB during that period.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $980,500 for\ncosts incurred to operate, maintain and repair the IOSB, and refurbish the spent fuel handling\nequipment stored in the IOSB.\n\n               6.

United States, 416 F.2d 1345, 1358 (Ct. Cl. 1969)); see also\nLocke v. United States, 283 F.2d 521, 524 (Ct. Cl. 1960) (“Certainty is sufficient if the evidence\nadduced enables the court to make a fair and reasonable approximation of the damages.”).\n\n       In this case, SMUD produced sufficient evidence for the court to make a fair and reasonable\napproximation of the brokerage fees it incurred to purchase ANI insurance. As the Aon director\nresponsible for all of SMUD’s brokerage fees, Mr. Whipple was in a position to testify regarding\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fwhat portion of SMUD’s brokerage fees are attributable to ANI insurance. The fact that Mr.\nWhipple was not employed by Aon during the negotiation of SMUD’s brokerage fees for the\nrelevant time period does not undermine his credibility. It is reasonable to assume that the\nmanaging director in charge of SMUD’s brokerage fees would familiarize himself with the factors\nthat affect their pricing.\n\n       In addition, Mr. Whipple’s methodology provides the basis for a “fair and reasonable\napproximation” of SMUD’s ANI brokerage fees. See Bluebonnet, 266 F.3d at 1355 (emphasis\nadded). Mr. Whipple testified that his methodology provided a conservative estimate of SMUD’s\nbrokerage fees, because “[i]f SMUD were to obtain brokerage services on the open market, it could\nexpect to pay a commission equal to a fixed percentage of the premium amounts.” PX 9 at ¶ 7\n(Whipple Declaration). A typical commission ranges from 10% to 15%. PX 9 at ¶ 7 (Whipple\nDeclaration). But, even assuming a 10% rate, SMUD’s ANI brokerage fee would be much higher\nthan Mr. Whipple’s estimate. PX 9 at ¶ 7 (Whipple Declaration). The Government does not\ndispute Mr. Whipple’s methodology, except to argue that he did not consider all of the factors that\ncould have affected the pricing of SMUD’s brokerage fees. But, “certainty” does not require\nSMUD to consider all of the relevant factors. Indeed, it is not “essential that the [amount of\ndamages] be ascertainable with absolute exactness or mathematical precision. See Bluebonnet,\n266 F.3d at 1355. SMUD is only required to provide the basis for a “fair and reasonable\napproximation.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD satisfied this standard.\nAccordingly, SMUD is entitled to recover $86,010 for brokerage fees incurred to purchase ANI\ninsurance.\n\n               7.      Whether The Government Is Entitled To An Offset For Certain ANI\n                       Insurance Refunds That SMUD Received.\n\n                         a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD also claims ANI insurance premiums from 2010 to 2015, because the Government\nis not entitled to a $682,397 offset for refunds that SMUD received between 2010 and 2014, for\npremiums that SMUD paid before 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 30. An offset based on these insurance\nrefunds would require the court to combine damages from this claim period with damages from an\nearlier claim period. See Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C (claiming breach of contract damages\nfor costs that SMUD incurred from 1992 to 2004). But, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit has held that combining damages from two separate claim periods violates “the\nsettled principle that a breaching party should never be placed in a better position as a result of its\nbreach.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 30 (quoting SMUD IX, 566 F. App’x at 996).\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n       The Government responds that SMUD’s ANI insurance claim should be offset by the full\namount of ANI refunds, received from 2010 to 2015, because these refunds lessen the financial\nimpact of paying premiums for those years. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 20. Moreover, the “premiums\nSMUD pays each year are not . . . segregated for a particular year.” Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 21.\n\n\n\n                                                  29\n\fInstead, the premiums go into a general fund that is used to pay claims, expenses and refunds.\nGov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 21. Refunds are calculated yearly. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 22.\n\n        In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that\nplaintiffs’ claims should reflect consideration of each claim period on its own. Gov’t Post Tr.\nResp. at 23 (citing Ind. Mich., 422 F.3d at 1376-78; Yankee Atomic, 536 F.3d at 1282). Therefore,\nall payments and refunds recorded from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015, should be included in\nthe court’s award of damages for that period. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 23. SMUD’s accounting\nsystem recorded ANI refunds as credits for the year that they were received. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp.\nat 23. But, SMUD’s damages claim does not reflect the full amount of those refunds. Gov’t Post\nTr. Resp. at 23. Accordingly, “SMUD overstated the cost it incurred between January 2010 and\nJune 2015 for ANI nuclear liability insurance . . . and [] should not be permitted to recover those\ncosts.” Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 23.\n\n                         c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n         SMUD replies that ANI refunds “reduce the net cost of insurance in the year the premium\nwas paid, not the year the refund was paid.” Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 17–18 (citing PX 33 at 111–12).\nIn fact, ANI distributes refunds on a pro rata basis only to those entities that paid a reserve premium\nten years before distribution. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 18 (citing PX 33 at 112, PC 32.002). Therefore,\nthe refunds paid to SMUD from 2009 to 2014 correspond to costs incurred between 2000 and\n2004. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 17. But, SMUD’s damages for the 1992–2004 claim period have\nalready been litigated in Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C. Accordingly, the court cannot award\nan offset that corresponds to that claim period. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 19.\n\n                         d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n         In cases arising out of DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract, plaintiffs must\nlitigate damages in successive suits. See Indiana Michigan Power Co. v. United States, 422 F.3d\n1369, 1376–78 (Fed. Cir. 2005). This litigation structure limits plaintiffs’ ability to collect future\ndamages. Id. In SMUD IX, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that\n“this precedent also limits [the Government’s] ability to obtain future offsets.” SMUD IX, 566 F.\nApp’x at 996 (citing Indiana Michigan Power, 422 F.3d at 1377)). Our appellate court also ruled\nthat an order staying judgment in one damages period, pending an offset determination related to\na later damages period, constituted a constructive award of future offsets. Id.\n\n        SMUD argues that the Government’s claimed offset is prohibited by SMUD IX, because\n“it seeks to take costs from one period . . . and use them against SMUD in the later period.” Pl.\nPost Tr. Br. at 30. But, the appellate court’s holding in SMUD IX is based on the principle that the\nGovernment cannot recover future offsets. See SMUD IX, 566 F. App’x at 996 (emphasis added).\nIn this case, the Government is seeking an offset that was realized in the current damages period,\nalthough it related to damages incurred prior to this period.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that the Government is entitled to a $682,397\noffset for ANI insurance refunds that SMUD received between 2010 and 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION.\n\n       For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to $28,867,161 in\ndamages to mitigate the Government’s partial breach of the Standard Contract from January 1,\n2010 to June 30, 2015. Accordingly, SMUD’s July 29, 2016 Motion For Partial Summary\nJudgment, pursuant to RCFC 56(a), is moot. The Clerk of the United States Court of Federal\nClaims is directed to enter final judgment in accordance with this Memorandum Opinion and Final\nOrder.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                   s/ Susan G.

Under the June 14, 1983 Standard Contract, the DOE had a legal obligation to begin\ndisposing of SMUD’s spent nuclear fuel (“SNF”) and high-level waste (“HLW”) on, or before,\nJanuary 31, 1998.

United States, Civil Action Docket No.\n               98-488C.2\n\n        SMUD is a publicly-owned municipal utility district established under the laws of\nCalifornia. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at 339. On June 14, 1983, SMUD and other nuclear-utility\nplants entered into a contract (the “Standard Contract”) with DOE, pursuant to the NWPA. Under\nthe Standard Contract, DOE was legally obligated to begin disposing and storing SMUD’s SNF\nand HLW, by January 31, 1998, and to continue to do so until disposal was complete. See 42\nU.S.C. § 10222(a)(5)(B). In exchange for DOE’s disposal and storage services, SMUD paid fees\nto the Nuclear Waste Fund. See 42 U.S.C. § 10222(a)(5)(B).\n\n       During the 1980’s, SMUD operated the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station (“Rancho\nSeco”), a nuclear power plant located in Sacramento, California. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at\n339. Throughout that time, however, Rancho Seco experienced significant operating problems\nand extended outages. Id. at 340. In fact, the plant worked at full capacity for less than half of its\noperating life. Id. For this and other reasons, on June 6, 1989, the voters of Sacramento chose to\nshut down Rancho Seco. Id. Immediately thereafter, SMUD began preparing for the plant’s\ndecommissioning process.3 Id. To that end, SMUD evaluated storage options for Rancho Seco’s\n\n\n       2\n           The following Memorandum Opinions and Orders were issued in Civil Action Docket\nNo. 98-488C: Sacramento Mun.

On January 19, 2005, the United States Court of Federal Claims\ndetermined that DOE breached the Standard Contract, because Maine Yankee Atomic Power\n“settled the legal issue of whether [DOE’s] failure to begin accepting nuclear waste by January 31,\n1998, constituted a breach . . . [.]” SMUD II, 63 Fed. Cl. at 502–03.\n\n        On March 31, 2006, the court also determined that SMUD was entitled to damages for\ncertain costs incurred from May 15, 1997 to December 31, 2003. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at\n332. Specifically, the court found that SMUD was entitled to recover costs for:\n\n              dry storage of SNF, id. at 367;\n              labor severance and recruiting, id. 369;\n              delays to complete the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (“ISFSI”),6\n               required to implement dry storage of SNF, id.;\n              storing failed SNF, id. at 370;\n\n       4\n         Dry cask storage is a method for storing spent nuclear fuel after it has cooled for at least\none year.         See UNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION GLOSSARY,\nhttps://www.nrc.gov/ reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/dry-cask-storage.html (last visited Feb. 23,\n2017). The fuel is sealed in casks that are welded or bolted closed and surrounded by steel,\nconcrete, lead, or other material to provide leak-tight containment and radiation shielding. See id.\nDual-purpose canisters are designed for dry storage, but also allow SNF to be transported within\na cask unit to a disposal site. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at 341 n.11.\n       5\n          To date, DOE has not disposed of or stored any of SMUD’s SNF or HLW. Answer at\n¶ 22, Sacramento Municipal Utility District v. United States, No. 15-577 (Fed. Cl.

Order Requesting Supplemental Expert Testimony at 1, Sacramento\nMunicipal Utility District v. United States, No. 98-488C (Fed. Cl. Mar. 31, 2006), ECF No. 354.\nThereafter, the parties supplemented the record and, on December 1, 2006, the court determined\nthat SMUD was entitled to an award of $39,796,234. See SMUD IV, 74 Fed. Cl. at 735. Thereafter,\nSMUD and the Government filed cross-appeals. 8\n\n        On August 7, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that\n“the Standard Contract [required] the [DOE] to accept SNF and HLW in accordance with the 1987\nannual capacity report [“ACR”].” SMUD V, 293 F. App’x at 771. That appellate court also held\nthat the United States Court of Federal Claims erred in granting the Government offsets for costs\nrelated to internal labor, dual-purpose caskets, and nonfuel storage, in the amount of $13,363,629.\nId. at 773–75. Accordingly, Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C was remanded, with instructions\nthat the trial court apply the 1987 ACR acceptance rate to assess causation and correct its offset\ndeterminations. See id. at 772.\n\n       On remand, the court applied the 1987 ACR acceptance rate and determined that SMUD\nwas entitled to $39,796,234 in mitigation costs. See SMUD VI, 91 Fed. Cl. at 18. Moreover, in\n\n       7\n        GTCC waste means “low-level radioactive waste that exceeds the concentration limits of\nradionuclides established for Class C waste in [10 C.F.R.] 61.55[.]” 10 C.F.R. 72.3.\n       8\n         In SMUD III, the court found that the parties’ evidence regarding the Standard Contract’s\nacceptance rate, i.e. the rate at which DOE was obligated to accept SNF from SMUD, was highly\nspeculative. See SMUD III, 70 Fed. Cl. at 375 n.40. For this reason, the court declined to\ndetermine an acceptance rate. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\flight of the appellate court’s holding that the Government should not receive offsets related to\ninternal labor, dual-purpose caskets and nonfuel storage, the court determined that SMUD was\nentitled to an additional $13,363,629. Id. Finally, the court denied the Government’s request for\nan offset related to savings that SMUD allegedly realized between 2004 and 2008. Id. at 19. The\ncourt found that, on September 4, 2009, SMUD filed a Complaint in Civil Action Docket No. 09-\n587C, seeking damages from January 1, 2004 onward and determined that any offset realized after\nJanuary 1, 2004, therefore, should be adjudicated in that case. Id. at 19. The court, however,\nstayed judgment in Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C, pending the court’s resolution of Civil\nAction Docket No. 09-587C. Id.\n\n       On March 12, 2010, SMUD filed a Petition For A Writ Of Mandamus, requesting that the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit order the court to lift the stay in Civil Action\nDocket No. 98–488C. On September 16, 2010, SMUD’s Petition was denied. See In re\nSacramento Mun. Util. Dist., 395 F. App’x at 688.\n\n       B.      Sacramento Municipal Utility District v. United States, Civil Action Docket No.\n               09-587C.\n\n       On September 4, 2009, SMUD filed a Complaint (“9/4/2009 Compl.”) in Civil Action\nDocket No. 09-587C alleging that, “[a]s a direct and proximate result of the [G]overnment’s partial\nbreach of the [Standard] Contract . . . SMUD has suffered [] damages from January 1, 2004\nforward, and will continue to suffer damages in the future.” 9/4/2009 Compl. at ¶ 23. On May\n17, 2011, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order, granting SMUD leave to\nsupplement the September 4, 2009 Complaint to allege a claim for damages incurred through\nDecember 31, 2009.

On January 31, 2013, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion\nand Final Order in Civil Action Docket No. 09-587C, determining that SMUD was entitled to\n$53,159,863 for costs incurred to mitigate the Government’s partial breach of the Standard\nContract from 1992 to 2003, plus $20,703,595 for costs incurred from 2004 to 2009.

The\ncourt also determined that the Government was entitled to an offset of $34,987,913 for wet pool\ncosts that SMUD avoided from 2004 to 2008. Id. Accordingly, the court awarded SMUD a total\nof $38,845,398 for the period between 1992 and 2009. Id. The parties filed cross-appeals.\n\n        On June 20, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims erred by applying an offset for the 2004–2009 damages\nperiod, to an earlier final judgment for the 1992–2003 damages period. See Sacramento Mun. Util.\nDist. v. United States, 566 F. App’x 985, 997 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (“SMUD IX”).\nAccordingly, the appellate court reversed the combined judgment of $38,845,398 for the 1992–\n2009 period and reinstated the prior $53,159,863 award for mitigation costs incurred between 1992\nand 2003. Id. at 986. Moreover, the appellate court vacated the damages award for 2004 to 2009\nand remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of SMUD’s argument that, in light of the\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fStandard Contract’s “Exchanges” provision, SMUD’s SNF would have been entirely removed\nbefore January 1, 2004, in the non-breach world.9\n\n        On remand, the court determined that, in the non-breach world, DOE would have removed\nall of Rancho Seco’s SNF by January 1, 2004.

ECF No. 7.\n\n         On September 21, 2015, the parties filed a Joint Preliminary Status Report, proposing two\ndifferent discovery schedules. ECF No. 8. On October 5, 2015, the court convened a Status\nConference to discuss a schedule acceptable to both parties. ECF No. 10. On October 28, 2015,\nthe court issued a Scheduling Order, that set the close of fact discovery for June 17, 2016 and a\ntrial date for October 2016. ECF No. 11.\n\n       On April 5, 2016, the Government filed a Motion To Extend Discovery And Stay Certain\nDeadlines, that SMUD opposed. ECF No. 15. On April 13, 2016, the court convened a Status\nConference to address the April 5, 2016 Motion. ECF No. 17.

The relevant facts described herein were derived from: the June 8,\n2015 Complaint (“6/8/2015 Compl.”); the July 30, 2015 Answer (“7/30/2015 Answer”); evidence\nadduced at a trial that took place from October 4–5, 2016 in Washington, D.C. (“TR at 1–352”);\nSMUD’s exhibits, introduced during trial (“PX 1–53,” “PD 1–13, 101–105”); and the\nGovernment’s exhibits, introduced during trial (“DX 1–73”).\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fto Rule of the United States Court of Federal Claims (“RCFC”) 56, arguing that the court should\ngrant SMUD summary judgment as to the $22,508,343 claimed by SMUD and not disputed by the\nGovernment (“Pl.

ECF No. 25.\n\n        On August 15, 2016, the Government filed a Response to the July 29, 2016 Motion For\nPartial Summary Judgment, confirming that the Government did not contest $22,362,864 of the\ndamages SMUD claimed (“Gov’t Resp.”). ECF No. 27. But, the Government argued that the\ncourt can only enter a partial judgment when, “an action presents more than one claim for relief.”\nGov’t Resp. at 2. In this case, however, the disputed and undisputed damages constitute a single\nclaim for relief. Gov’t Resp. at 2. Therefore, the court is required as a matter of law, to deny the\nJuly 29, 2016 Motion For Partial Summary Judgment. Gov’t Resp. at 2.\n\n        On August 15, 2016, the Government also filed a Motion To Modify the April 18, 2016\nScheduling Order. ECF No. 29. On August 19, 2016, the court denied the Government’s Motion\nto modify the April 18, 2016 Scheduling Order. On that same day, the Government filed a Witness\nList, Exhibit List, and Memorandum Of Contentions Of Fact And Law. ECF Nos. 31–33.\n\n         On September 8, 2016, SMUD filed a Reply in support of its July 29, 2016 Motion For\nPartial Summary Judgment, arguing that the Government’s definition of a “claim” is overly\nrestrictive, elevating form over substance (“Pl. Reply”). ECF No. 37. On September 14, 2016,\nthe Government filed an Amended Exhibit List, correcting the dates and descriptions of several\nexhibits. ECF No. 40.\n\n         On September 28, 2017, the court issued a Pretrial Order, instructing the parties to file the\nwritten direct examination testimony of their expert witnesses on the next day. ECF No. 41.\nPursuant to the Pretrial Order, on September 29, 2016, the parties filed the written direct testimony\nof their experts. ECF Nos. 42–43.

During trial, the court instructed each party to submit supplemental briefing\nregarding SMUD’s July 29, 2016 Motion For Partial Summary Judgment. TR at 24. On October\n7, 2016, the Government filed a Supplemental Brief (“Gov’t Supp. Br.”). ECF No. 46.\n\n       On October 11, 2016, the Government filed a Second Amended Exhibit List. ECF. No.\n47. On October 19, 2016, SMUD filed a Third Amended Exhibit List. ECF No. 48. On October\n20, 2016, SMUD filed a Response to the October 7, 2016 Supplemental Brief (“Pl.

Jurisdiction.\n\n        The United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1491, “to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the\nConstitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any\nexpress or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in\ncases not sounding in tort.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) (emphasis added). The Tucker Act, however,\nis “a jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United\nStates for money damages. . . . [T]he Act merely confers jurisdiction upon [the United States\nCourt of Federal Claims] whenever the substantive right exists.” United States v. Testan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109386\"><a href=\"/opinion/109386/united-states-v-testan/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 398 (1976). To pursue a substantive right under the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify and\nplead an independent contractual relationship, constitutional provision, federal statute and/or\nexecutive agency regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages. See\nTodd v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788114\"><a href=\"/opinion/788114/jerry-todd-benjamin-e-abeyta-christopher-blas-abeyta-richard-acker/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (emphasis added). In a breach of\ncontract case, “the money-mandating requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction normally is satisfied\nby the presumption that money damages are available for breach of contract, with no further\ninquiry being necessary.” Holmes v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613464\"><a href=\"/opinion/613464/holmes-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2011).\n\n        In this case, the June 8, 2015 Complaint alleges that: (1) SMUD entered into an express\ncontract with DOE on June 14, 1983; (2) DOE breached, and continues to breach, the June 14,\n1983 Contract; and (3) SMUD is entitled to damages for the ongoing breach. 6/8/2015 Compl. at\n¶¶ 1, 13, 28. Because SMUD’s claims are based on the alleged breach of a contractual relationship\nwith the Government, the court has determined that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate those claims.\nSee Holmes, 657 F.3d at 1314.\n\n       B.      Standing.\n\n        The United States Supreme Court has held that “the question of standing is whether the\nlitigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.”\nWarth v.

Cir. 1990) (“To maintain a cause of action pursuant to the Tucker Act that is based on a\ncontract, the contract must be between the plaintiff and the [G]overnment.”).\n\n       In this case, it is undisputed that SMUD was a signatory and intended beneficiary of the\nJune 14, 1983 Standard Contract. 7/30/2015 Answer at ¶ 1 (“[The Government] [a]dmits that in\n1983, SMUD entered into a standard contract . . . for the disposal of [SNF] and/or [HLW], by\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f[DOE].”). Therefore, the court has determined that SMUD is in privity of contract with the\nGovernment.

SMUD’s Argument.\n\n       SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $3,685,112 for maintenance of the T&R and\nPAP buildings from 2010 to 2015, because these costs are attributable to the presence of SNF at\nRancho Seco. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 6–7. The court has determined in prior litigation that, in the non-\nbreach world, DOE would have removed all of SMUD’s SNF by 2004 and SMUD would have\ncompletely exited the nuclear industry by 2009. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 2. For these reasons, the court\nawarded SMUD maintenance and operations costs in Civil Action Docket No. 09-587C, and\nshould do so again in this case. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 6.\n\n         The evidence adduced at trial proves that SMUD’s site operations costs are attributable to\nDOE’s ongoing failure to remove Rancho Seco’s SNF. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 7. Mr. Ronningen15\ntestified that SMUD’s site operations costs were related to operating and maintaining facilities\nused by personnel that support SNF storage. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 8. These costs were “required\nbecause of the presence of the spent nuclear fuel and the staff [at Rancho Seco] safely managing\nit.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 7 (quoting TR at 61–62, 85 (Ronningen)).\n\n      At trial, the Government did not refute Mr. Ronningen’s testimony. In fact, the\nGovernment’s expert witness, Mr. Warren Brewer,16 agreed that it is necessary to have security\n\n       14\n          “[T]he IOSB was used to store contaminated spent fuel handling equipment, which\nSMUD maintains for use in ongoing spent fuel transfer campaigns, and which SMUD intends to\nuse to move spent fuel during SMUD’s Part 72 relicensing process, if necessary.” PX 52 at 22–\n23 (Metcalfe). Moreover, SMUD stored Class B and Class C waste in the IOSB until 2014. PX\n52 at 23 (Metcalfe).\n       15\n         Mr. Einar Ronningen is SMUD’s senior representative at the Rancho Seco site. TR at\n41. In that capacity, he is responsible for the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel. TR at 41\n(Ronningen).\n       16\n           Mr. Warren Keith Brewer is the President of ABZ, Incorporated, an engineering\nconsulting company. TR at 232. Mr. Brewer has a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical\nengineering from Louisiana Tech University and a Masters of Science degree in nuclear\nengineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. TR at 233. In addition, Mr. Brewer\nhas taken graduate-level courses at the Bettis Reactor Engineering School. TR at 233.

TR at 243 (Brewer). Mr. Brewer also agreed that\nthe costs of maintaining the nuclear records vault and the security gate at the entrance of the\nRancho Seco site are attributable to the presence of SNF. TR at 246–47 (Brewer).\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n         The Government challenges $3,663,129 of the costs claimed by SMUD for maintenance\nand operation of the T&R building and PAP building, because those facilities support personnel\nthat perform non-nuclear activities at Rancho Seco. Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 9–10. Therefore, the\nmaintenance of these buildings is not related to DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract.\nGov’t Post Tr. Br. at 9. In addition, SMUD did not “prove the extent to which [its] incurred costs\ndiffer from the costs [it] would have incurred in the non-breach world,” because SMUD failed to\npresent evidence of what its maintenance and operations costs would have been if DOE performed\non the Standard Contract. Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 11 (citing Energy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1306). Mr.\nRonningen testified that SMUD’s claim includes costs that “he determined had any connection,\neither directly or indirectly, to the presence of [SNF at Rancho Seco].” Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 12.\nBut, Mr. Ronningen failed to consider whether costs for the same or similar activities would have\nbeen incurred if DOE had disposed of SMUD’s SNF by 2004. Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 12.\n\n       Moreover, to the extent that SMUD argues that “it has satisfied its causation burden\nbecause . . . no buildings or personnel would be located at the Rancho Seco Industrial Facility in\nthe non-breach world, its argument conflicts with SMUD’s continued [use] of the site for non-\nSNF-related activities.” Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 14. As Mr. Ronningen testified, in the non-breach\nworld, SMUD’s switchyard17 and solar power plant, Western Area Power Administration’s\n(“WAPA”)18 communications equipment, and the Cosumnes Gas-fired Power Plant would still be\nlocated at Rancho Seco. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 14 (citing TR at 140, 144, 171 (Ronningen)).\n\n\n\nhas worked in the nuclear industry for over forty years. TR at 232. He began his nuclear career\nwith the United States Navy, as an employee of the Division of Labor Reactors. TR at 233. After\nten years, he moved to a consulting company named Picard, Lowe and Garrick. TR at 234. Mr.\nBrewer left Picard, Lowe and Garrick to begin ABZ, Incorporated. TR at 234. In his work as a\nnuclear engineering consultant, the United States Court of Federal Claims has qualified Mr.\nBrewer as an expert in nuclear engineering and nuclear decommissioning. TR at 239. During\ntrial, the Government proffered Mr. Brewer as an expert in nuclear engineering—that includes\nSNF management, nuclear power plant systems, NRC regulations, and nuclear power plant\nmodifications—as well as nuclear decommissioning. TR at 241. SMUD did not object to Mr.\nBrewer’s qualifications. TR at 241. Accordingly, the court has determined that Mr. Brewer is an\nexpert in his respective field and qualified to testify as such. See Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n       17\n         The switchyard is the “infrastructure that was installed to take the electricity that Rancho\nSeco generated and put it on the distribution grid.” TR at 119 (Ronningen).\n       18\n         WAPA is an agency within the United States Department of Energy that transmits and\nsells hydropower across fifteen central and western states. See WESTERN AREA POWER\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f                        c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n        SMUD replies that the evidence presented at trial established that, in the non-breach world,\nSMUD would not have incurred maintenance and operation costs for the T&R building and PAP\nbuilding from 2010 to 2015. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 3. Mr. Ronningen testified that Rancho Seco is\nno longer a functioning power plant, so the only employees located there are nuclear staff. Pl. Post\nTr. Reply at 5 (citing TR at 69 (Ronningen)). The nuclear staff is at Rancho Seco solely to oversee\nthe safe storage of SNF. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 3 (citing TR at 65 (Ronningen)). Moreover, it is\nundisputed that these employees are necessary to “manage, operate, and guard the SNF, as well as\nensure compliance with NRC regulations, including [maintenance of] a nuclear record vault\n[onsite].” Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 5 (citing TR at 243–45 (Brewer)). The T&R building and PAP\nbuilding house the offices of Rancho Seco’s nuclear staff and are not used by any other SMUD\nemployee. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 5 (citing TR at 69 (Ronningen)). This evidence demonstrates that,\nin the non-breach world, SMUD would not have incurred costs to maintain the T&R building and\nPAP building.\n\n                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Causation is an issue of fact that plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence.\nSee Energy Capital, 302 F.3d at 1332 (“In contract cases, causation, foreseeability, and certainty\nare questions of fact.”); id. at 1325 (instructing that plaintiff must prove causation by a\npreponderance of the evidence to recover expectancy damages in a breach of contract claim). In\ncases arising out of DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract, causation requires the court to\ncompare the breach world with a hypothetical non-breach world. See Yankee Atomic, 536 F.3d at\n1273. Plaintiff is entitled to recover only those costs that (1) were caused by DOE’s breach, Energy\nCapital, 302 F.3d at 1325, and (2) Plaintiff would not have incurred in the non-breach world,\nEnergy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1307.\n\n        The Government argues that SMUD is not entitled to recover costs incurred to maintain\nthe T&R and PAP buildings, because those costs benefit SMUD’s non-nuclear business objectives\nand provide only incidental benefits to the storage of SNF. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In other\nwords, SMUD has failed to establish that its claimed costs are attributable to the continued\npresence of SNF at Rancho Seco. The weight of the evidence, however, cuts against the\nGovernment’s argument. At trial, Mr. Ronningen testified that in 2010 the T&R building\ncontained offices for nuclear staff and security officers, responsible for guarding Rancho Seco’s\nSNF. TR at 65 (Ronningen). No one else occupied the building. TR at 65 (Ronningen). After\n2010, the nuclear staff and security officers were transferred to the PAP building. TR at 67–68\n(Ronningen). The PAP building housed only these employees. TR at 81 (Ronningen). At the\ntime of the move, SMUD stopped maintaining the T&R building and, in 2015, demolished it. TR\nat 81, 86 (Ronningen).\n\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATION HISTORY, https://www.wapa.gov/About/history/Pages/History.aspx (last visited\nFeb. 23, 2017).\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f        The Government did not produce affirmative evidence to rebut Mr. Ronningen’s testimony.\nBut, during cross-examination, Mr. Ronningen admitted that the PAP building served as a\ncheckpoint for the entire Rancho Seco complex and that non-nuclear personnel sometimes passed\nthrough there. TR at 167 (Ronningen). The witness, however, clarified that the PAP building\nlikely remained a checkpoint, because the nuclear staff and security officers were located there.\nTR at 167 (Ronningen). In the non-breach world, the PAP building would have been unoccupied.\nTR at 81 (Ronningen). Moreover, the Government’s own witness admitted that costs for\nmaintaining and operating offices for Rancho Seco’s nuclear staff and security force are\nattributable to DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract. TR at 246–47 (Brewer). Therefore,\nthe court has determined that SMUD established that the costs incurred to maintain and operate\nthe T&R and PAP buildings are attributable to the continued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco.\n\n        In addition, SMUD has established that it would not have incurred costs to maintain and\noperate the T&R and PAP buildings in the non-breach world. Mr. Ronningen testified that the\nT&R building was occupied only by nuclear staff. TR at 65 (Ronningen). And, that virtually all\nof the costs associated with maintaining and operating the T&R building seized after those\nemployees moved out. TR at 86 (Ronningen). In fact, SMUD demolished the T&R building a\nshort time after the nuclear staff was transferred to the PAP building. TR at 81 (Ronningen). The\nGovernment did not rebut this testimony. Instead, Mr. Brewer admitted that the presence of SNF\nat Rancho Seco made it necessary to have nuclear staff and security personnel onsite. TR at 243\n(Brewer). And, that these employees need offices with functioning lights, heating and ventilation,\nrunning water, bathrooms, computers and internets access, and fire safety equipment. TR at 244–\n45 (Brewer). In other words, the nuclear staff requires an operational office building and that\noffice building must be maintained. Based on the testimony of Mr. Ronningen and Mr. Brewer,\nthe court has determined that, in the non-breach world, SMUD would not have incurred costs to\nmaintain and operate the T&R building after 2004, when all of Rancho Seco’s SNF would have\nbeen removed.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen also testified that the PAP building would have been unoccupied in the\nnon-breach world. TR at 81 (Ronningen). In addition, the PAP building does not provide any\nsupport to SMUD’s Backup Control Center (“BCC”), 19 switchyard or solar power plant. TR at\n119, 121 (Ronningen). The Government produced evidence that the PAP building serves as a\nsecurity checkpoint for the entire Rancho Seco facility. TR at 167 (Ronningen). But, as mentioned\nabove, Mr. Ronningen explained that the PAP building only served as a de facto checkpoint,\nbecause the nuclear staff and security personnel are already located there. TR at 167 (Ronningen).\nTherefore, the court has determined that in the non-breach world, SMUD would not have incurred\ncosts to maintain and operate the PAP building.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n          “SMUD maintains a backup control center at [Rancho Seco], which ensures that in the\nevent of an emergency at SMUD’s headquarters in downtown Sacramento . . . the utility will still\nbe able to operate its grid and provide power to its customers.” TR at 27–28 (Ronningen).\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $3,685,112\nfor costs incurred to maintain and operate the T&R and PAP buildings from January 1, 2010 to\nJune 30, 2015.\n\n               2.     Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred For Site\n                      Consolidation, Upgrades To The PAP Building’s Water And Septic\n                      Systems, And Planning To Replace The ISFSI Backup Generator.\n\n                        a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n       SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $698,255 for site consolidation costs, because\nthose costs are attributable to DOE’s partial breach of the June 14, 1983 Standard Contract and are\nreasonable. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 13. Specifically, SMUD claims $567,505 for costs incurred moving\nRancho Seco’s nuclear staff from the T&R building to the PAP building and $126,114 for work\ndone to the PAP building’s water and septic systems after the move. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 13–14.\nSMUD also claims $4,637 for planning that was necessary to replace the ISFSI backup generator,\nrequired by NRC regulations. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 13–14.\n\n        SMUD’s site consolidation effort, and water and septic upgrades are attributable to the\npresence of SNF at Rancho Seco. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 18. And, these efforts reduced SMUD’s\noperation costs from 2010 to 2015. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 18. In addition, SMUD should recover the\ncost of planning to replace the ISFSI backup generator, because SMUD was required to have a\nbackup generator for the ISFSI. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 14 (citing DX 73 at ¶ 27 (Brewer)).\n\n                        b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n       The Government challenges the $698,255 claimed by SMUD for site consolidation,\nupgrades to the PAP building’s water and septic systems, and planning to replace the ISFSI backup\ngenerator, as they were incurred to improve infrastructure that provides support to Rancho Seco’s\nnon-nuclear business. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In addition, SMUD did not “prove the extent\nto which [its] incurred costs differ from the costs [it] would have incurred in the non-breach\nworld.” Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 11 (citing Energy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1306).\n\n                        c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n        SMUD replies that the purpose of the site consolidation project was to “to move the staff\noverseeing the nuclear fuel from the large, aging T&R building to the smaller PAP building in\norder to save operations and maintenance expenses.” Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 8 (citing TR at 68, 78–\n81 (Ronningen); PX 20 (Site Consolidation Presentation)). SMUD upgraded the PAP building’s\nwater and septic systems to reduce operating expenses. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 8 (citing TR at 73–\n74 (Ronningen); see also PX 20.013–20.014). If DOE had removed the SNF from Rancho Seco\nby 2004, SMUD would not have needed to consolidate the T&R and PAP buildings, or upgraded\nthe water and septic systems. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 9 (citing TR at 81 (Ronningen)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen testified that he prepared SMUD’s damages claim and that his objective\nthroughout that process was “[t]o capture the costs associated with the presence of spent nuclear\nfuel at Rancho Seco.” TR at 48 (Ronningen). In determining what costs to include in the claim,\nMr. Ronningen “evaluat[ed] [] the work that was done . . . and ma[de] a reasonable assumption\nand a conservative assumption about how much of [those] costs were directly related to the\npresence of spent nuclear fuel.” TR at 51–52 (Ronningen). The Government argues that this\ntestimony demonstrates that Mr. Ronningen did not consider whether costs related to site\nconsolidation, upgrades to the PAP building’s water and septic systems, and planning to replace\nthe ISFSI backup generator would have been incurred in the non-breach world. Gov’t Post Tr. Br.\nat 12.\n\n       During the trial, however, SMUD presented credible evidence of the non-breach world,\ndemonstrating that SMUD would not have consolidated the T&R and PAP buildings, upgraded\nthe water and septic system in the PAP building, or replaced the ISFSI’s backup generator if DOE\nhad performed on the Standard Contract. Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have\n“done the consolidation from the T&R building to the PAP building if the spent fuel was gone by\n2004[.]” TR at 81 (Ronningen). He also testified that SMUD would not have needed a septic\nsystem or new drinking water system in Rancho Seco if DOE had removed the SNF. TR at 78\n(Ronningen). Finally, Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have purchased the ISFSI\nbackup generator if the SNF was offsite. TR at 100 (Ronningen). Moreover, the generator did not\nprovide ancillary benefits to any other equipment at Rancho Seco, except for some WAPA\ninstruments. TR at 99 (Ronningen). But, in the non-breach world, those instruments would be\nlocated in the switchyard and connected to a separate generator. TR at 163, 217 (Ronningen).\n\n        The Government’s expert witness, Mr. Brewer, testified that “SMUD has not explained\nhow the site modifications or consolidation efforts have been influenced by the presence of\npersonnel remaining on the site for decommissioning or other functions not needed for the\ncontinued storage of spent nuclear fuel.” DX 72 at ¶ 42 (Brewer). But, this testimony is inaccurate.\nAt trial, SMUD presented evidence that, after consolidation, only nuclear staff and security\npersonnel had offices in the PAP building. TR at 81 (Ronningen). And, the PAP building did not\nprovide support to other Rancho Seco buildings. TR at TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). In addition,\nMr. Ronningen testified that the SMUD employees who worked on the BCC, switchyard and solar\npower plant were not permanently stationed at Rancho Seco. TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). Instead,\nthey worked from SMUD headquarters and visited the site a few times per year to check on\nequipment. TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). Finally, Mr. Ronningen knew that non-nuclear staff\nperiodically visited Rancho Seco, but he nevertheless testified that the site consolidation project\nwould not have occurred but-for the required presence of nuclear staff and security onsite. TR at\n81, 164 (Ronningen). Combined, this evidence demonstrates that the presence of non-nuclear staff\nat Rancho Seco did not impact the site consolidation project.\n\n       Mr. Brewer also testified that SMUD failed to explain why its decision to consolidate the\nT&R and PAP buildings in 2010 was attributable to the continued presence of SNF at Rancho\nSeco, given that all of Rancho Seco’s SNF had been in dry storage since 2002 and the activities\nneeded to store the SNF had remained static for several years. DX 72 at ¶ 41 (Brewer). But, Mr.\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fRonningen testified that Rancho Seco’s nuclear staff was greatly reduced when SMUD completed\nthe decommissioning process in 2008. TR at 67 (Ronningen). In fact, by the end of 2010, SMUD’s\nnuclear staff had been reduced from “about a dozen” to three. TR at 65 (Ronningen). It made\nlittle sense for three people to occupy an entire building, especially a thirty-year old one with five\nstories and an aging HVAC. TR at 66–67 (Ronningen). It is undisputed, however, that the\ncontinued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco required SMUD to maintain some nuclear staff onsite.\nTR at 243 (Brewer) (“Q. You agree that it’s necessary to have people to manage the spent fuel,\nright? A. I do. Q. And it’s necessary to have security personnel to guard the fuel, correct? A. It\nis. Q. SMUD needs staff like Mr. Ronningen to work with the NRC to ensure compliance, right?\nA. They need some level of staff to ensure compliance, that’s correct.”). It is also undisputed that\nthe nuclear staff needs offices to work in. TR at 244 (Brewer) (“So, you do agree that SMUD\nneeds a building for the security staff to work in, Mr. Brewer, right? A. Just -- I do, just as any\nother people that are on the site need somewhere to do their work.”). This testimony demonstrates\nthat SMUD’s decision to consolidate the T&R and PAP building in 2010 was attributable to the\ncontinued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco.\n\n       For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to $698,255 for cost\nincurred for Site Consolidation, upgrades to the PAP building’s water and septic systems, and\nplanning to replace the ISFSI backup generator.\n\n               3.      Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred To Replace The\n                       HVAC Unit And Install New Carpet In The PAP Building.\n\n                         a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $452,899, incurred to replace the PAP building’s\nfailing HVAC unit. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19. The PAP building houses nuclear personnel and a\nnuclear records vault, that must be maintained onsite due to the continued presence of SNF at\nRancho Seco. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 20. The vault and personnel housed in the PAP building require\nadequate heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19–20. The PAP building’s\noriginal HVAC unit was installed in the 1980s. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19 (citing TR at 104\n(Ronningen)). In 2015, when SMUD decided to replace it, the old equipment was antiquated and\nfailing. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 19 (citing TR at 104–05 (Ronningen)).\n\n        SMUD also argues that it is entitled to recover $28,308 because “[i]t was eminently\nreasonable for SMUD to install carpet in the PAP building to prepare the PAP to serve as the staff\noffice building.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 20 (citing TR at 82–83 (Ronningen)).\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n        The Government challenges SMUD’s claimed costs for installation of the PAP building’s\nnew HVAC unit and carpets, because these costs were incurred to improve infrastructure that\nprovides support to non-SNF workers. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In addition, the Government\nargues that SMUD did not “prove the extent to which [its] incurred costs differ from the costs [it]\nwould have incurred in the non-breach world.” Gov’t Post Tr. Br. at 11 (citing Energy Nw., 641\nF.3d at 1306)).\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f                        c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n        SMUD replies that “[t]he Government presents no facts or evidence to dispute the causal\nconnection between [DOE’s] breach [of the Standard Contract] and the HVAC [and] carpet costs.”\nPl. Post Tr. Reply at 10. Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have moved the SNF staff\nto the PAP building, if DOE removed Rancho Seco’s SNF by 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 10 (citing\nTR at 81 (Ronningen)). And, if the PAP building would not have been occupied in the non-breach\nworld, then SMUD would not have needed to replace the HVAC unit and carpets in that building.\nPl. Post Tr. Reply at 10. Therefore, the costs that SMUD incurred to replace the HVAC unit and\ncarpets are due to DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract and the Government’s witnesses did not\noffer any evidence to rebut this conclusion. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 10.\n\n                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen testified that the PAP building did not provide support to other Rancho\nSeco buildings. TR at 119, 121 (Ronningen). And, the nuclear staff and security were the only\nemployees located in the PAP building. TR at 81 (Ronningen). The Government did not present\nany evidence to the contrary. Therefore, SMUD established that the PAP building’s new HVAC\nunit and carpets do not benefit Rancho Seco’s non-nuclear activities.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen also testified that, in the non-breach world, the PAP building would not\nhave been occupied. TR at 81 (Ronningen). Therefore, SMUD would not have installed new\ncarpets in the building. And, the failing HVAC system would not have been replaced. TR at 106\n(Ronningen). The Government did not offer any specific evidence to rebut this testimony.\nAccordingly, SMUD has established that, in the non-breach world, it would not have incurred\ncosts to replace the PAP building’s HVAC unit and carpets.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $481,207 for\ncosts incurred to replace the HVAC unit and install new carpets in the PAP building.\n\n               4.      Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred To Replace The\n                       ISFSI Backup Generator And Refurbish Parts Of Rancho Seco’s\n                       Electrical Infrastructure.\n\n                        a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD argues that it is entitled to recover $573,214 for costs incurred to replace the diesel\ngenerator that provides backup power to the ISFSI and associated modification to the aging\nelectrical infrastructure that supports the ISFSI and the PAP building. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21. NRC\nregulations require SMUD to maintain a functioning backup generator for the ISFSI and the\nISFSI’s original backup generator reached the end of its useful life during the claim period. Pl.\nPost Tr. Br. at 21 (citing TR at 95–96, 99 (Ronningen)). Therefore, SMUD was required to\npurchase and install a new backup generator and associated switchgear to comply with NRC\nregulations. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21 (citing TR at 95–96, 99 (Ronningen)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f         Replacing the backup generator and switchgear involved “substantial work to design and\nimplement the integration of the new equipment into the existing electrical distribution system,\ninstall the new equipment, connect it to the distribution infrastructure, purchase project-related\ncabling and fencing, and establish a concrete pad on which to place the generator.” Pl. Post Tr.\nBr. at 21. Additionally, as part of the replacement process, SMUD updated the aging electrical\ninfrastructure that supplies power to the ISFSI and PAP building. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21. But,\nSMUD would not have replaced the backup generator or performed any of the related electrical\nwork, if DOE had removed all SMUD’s SNF by 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 21–22.\n\n         The Government does not dispute that SMUD is entitled to recover the purchase price of\nthe backup generator and switchgear, but argues that the cost of installing that equipment should\nbe excluded from SMUD’s claim. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22. But, Mr. Brewer, their own expert,\ntestified “that the costs of installing the generator and switchgear are attributable to the SNF\nremaining onsite.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22 (citing TR at 257 (Brewer)). The “installation costs”\ninclude: “mounting the generator, connecting it to the fuel source, labor costs, and securing the\ngenerator with a fence.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22 (citing TR at 257 (Brewer)).\n\n        Mr. Ronningen’s testimony also demonstrates that SMUD replaced the ISFSI backup\ngenerator and performed improvements to the electrical infrastructure for the sole purpose of\nproviding backup power to Rancho Seco’s nuclear function. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 24. The\nGovernment argues that this claim includes “costs associated with site restoration,” such as “the\nre-feed of lighting power to the Turbine building, Chlorine building, and Warehouse/shops\nbuilding,” is mistaken. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 22–23 (citing DX 73 at ¶ 52 (Brewer)). SMUD, however,\nonly worked on the electrical equipment in the turbine and chlorine buildings, because the existing\nelectrical distribution system passed through those facilities and it was less costly to refurbish the\nold equipment than to create a brand new system that avoided the two buildings entirely. Pl. Post\nTr. Br. at 23. Although the warehouse building “may have lights that are powered through the\nnuclear electrical distribution system,” it would not be in use if Rancho Seco’s SNF had been\nremoved by 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 24 n.11. Finally, the backup generator and improvements to\nthe electrical distribution systems do not support the BCC or switchyard building. Pl. Post Tr. Br.\nat 23 (citing TR at 97, 154, 162–63 (Ronningen)).\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n        The Government challenges $449,717 of SMUD’s claim for costs incurred replacing the\nbackup generator and refurbishing parts of Rancho Seco’s electrical infrastructure, because they\nwere incurred to improve infrastructure that provides support to non-nuclear activities at Rancho\nSeco. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 9–10. In addition, SMUD did not “prove the extent to which [its]\nincurred costs differ from the costs [it] would have incurred in the non-breach world.” Gov’t Post\nTr. Br. at 11 (citing Energy Nw., 641 F.3d at 1306)).\n\n                         c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n       SMUD replies that, in the non-breach world, it would not have purchased a new backup\ngenerator for the ISFSI. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 11 (citing TR at 100 (Ronningen)). As Mr. Brewer\nconceded, the cost to purchase and install the generator is attributable to SNF remaining at Rancho\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fSeco. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 11 (citing TR at 256–57 (Brewer)). Similarly, “[t]he only reason why\nthe electrical distribution system continues to exist at Rancho Seco is to support the nuclear\ninfrastructure.” Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 11 (citing TR at 162 (Ronningen)). Therefore, SMUD’s\nimprovements to the electrical system only benefitted Rancho Seco’s SNF-related operations. Pl.\nPost Tr. Reply at 11 (citing TR at 97–99, 163 (Ronningen)).\n\n                         d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        Mr. Ronningen testified that the backup generator does not provide any ancillary benefit\nto non-nuclear equipment, except certain WAPA instruments. TR at 99 (Ronningen). But, in the\nnon-breach world, those instruments would be located at the switchyard, which has a separate\nbackup generator. TR at 163, 217 (Ronningen). Moreover, SMUD’s upgrades to the electrical\nsystem do not benefit Rancho Seco’s non-nuclear functions. TR at 97, 98, 154, 162–63\n(Ronningen). As rebuttal evidence, the Government produced Mr. Brewer’s testimony that\nSMUD should not recover some of the costs incurred to upgrade the electrical system, because\nthose upgrades help support power distribution to buildings that have a non-nuclear function. DX\n73 at ¶ 52 (Brewer). Specifically, Mr. Brewer identified “the Turbine building, Chlorine building,\nand Warehouse/shops building.” DX 73 at ¶ 52 (Brewer). Mr. Ronningen, however, explained\nthat the Turbine and Chlorine buildings were not operational during the claim period. TR at 98\n(Ronningen) (“Q. Were the turbine building and chlorine building -- was that being used in any\nway during the claim period? A. No, there’s no functions that occur in there[.]”). Regarding the\nwarehouse, Mr. Ronningen testified that there may be some lighting in that building. TR at 154\n(Ronningen) (emphasis added). But, most of the material stored there is SNF handling equipment.\nTR at 221 (Ronningen). Therefore, SMUD has established that installation of the backup generator\nand associated upgrades to portions the electrical infrastructure, were not performed for the benefit\nof Rancho Seco’s non-nuclear functions.\n\n       Moreover, Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have purchased the backup\ngenerator or done any of the associated electrical work, if DOE had removed Rancho Seco’s SNF\nby 2004. TR at 100 (Ronningen). The Government does not dispute this testimony. In fact, on\ncross-examination, Mr. Brewer admitted that the cost of purchasing a new backup generator and\nswitchgear, and installing that equipment were attributable to the presence of SNF at Rancho Seco.\nTR at 256–57. Therefore, SMUD has established that, in the non-breach world, it would not: have\npurchased the ISFSI backup generator or switchgear; installed that equipment; or upgraded the\nrelevant portions of Rancho Seco’s electrical distribution infrastructure.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $573,214 for\ncosts incurred to replace the ISFSI backup generator and renovate parts of the electrical distribution\nsystem that supports the ISFSI and the PAP building.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f                 5.      Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Costs Incurred For Operating,\n                         Maintaining And Repairing The IOSB And For Refurbishing Fuel\n                         Handling Equipment Stored In The IOSB.\n\n                           a.     SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD argues that it incurred $980,500 in costs for operating, maintaining and repairing\nthe IOSB, and refurbishing the spent fuel handling equipment stored there. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 9\n(citing PX 50; TR at 57–60 (Ronningen)). The court awarded SMUD similar costs in Civil Action\nDocket No. 09-587C, and should do so again in this case. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 9.\n\n        In 2002, SMUD used fuel handling equipment to transfer Rancho Seco’s SNF from the\nwet-pool to the newly constructed ISFSI. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 9. As a result, this equipment became\nradioactively contaminated and it had to be stored in a licensed facility, such as the IOSB. Pl. Post\nTr. Br. at 9. During construction of a permanent storage building that was not completed before\nJune 30, 2015, the IOSB housed the fuel handling equipment. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 9.\n\n        At trial, Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD would not have used the ISOB to store fuel\nhandling equipment, if DOE had removed the SNF by 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 10 (citing TR at\n60 (Ronningen)). And, Mr. Brewer agreed that the presence of fuel handling equipment at Rancho\nSeco and the work necessary to maintain that equipment, were attributable to the presence of SNF.\nPl. Post Tr. Br. at 10 (citing TR at 254 (Brewer)).\n\n        In sum, as long as SNF is stored at Rancho Seco, it will be necessary for SMUD to store\nthe fuel handling equipment onsite, because an emergency may require the removal of an SNF\ncanister. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 9 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691). Additionally, SMUD is\npreparing to renew its ISFSI license, pursuant to 10 C.F.R. 72.20 And, as part of the relicensing\nprocess, the NRC may require SMUD to extract SNF canisters from the ISFSI. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at\n10.\n\n                           b.     The Government’s Response.\n\n       The Government responds that SMUD recovered IOSB costs in Civil Action Docket No.\n09-587C, based on specific circumstances that do not apply in this case. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at\n18. In Docker No. 09-587C, SMUD argued that it refurbished the IOSB to store Class B and C\n\n\n       20\n            10 C.F.R. 72, in relevant part, provides,\n\n        requirements, procedures, and criteria for the issuance of licenses to receive,\n       transfer, and possess power reactor spent fuel, power reactor-related Greater than\n       Class C (GTCC) waste, and other radioactive materials associated with spent fuel\n       storage in an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) and the terms and\n       conditions under which the Commission will issue these licenses.\n\n10 C.F.R. 72.1.\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fwaste.21 Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 18 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 690). The court, however,\ndetermined that all Rancho Seco’s nuclear waste, including Class B and C waste, would have been\nremoved by 2009, if DOE had performed on the Standard Contract. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 18\n(citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691). Therefore, “in the non-breach world, SMUD would not\nhave refurbished the IOSB nor incurred operation and maintenance costs for the IOSB.” Gov’t\nPost Tr. Resp. at 18 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691). In addition, the court determined\nthat, in the non-breach world, SMUD would not be required to maintain transfer equipment at\nRancho Seco, because SMUD’s SNF and HLW would have been removed by 2004. Gov’t Post\nTr. Resp. at 18 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691).\n\n        In this case, however, Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD removed all Class B and C\nwaste from Rancho Seco in 2014. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 19–20 (citing TR at 185 (Ronningen)).\nIn addition, Mr. Ronningen also testified that SMUD intended to decommission and dismantle the\nIOSB despite the continued presence of SNF at Rancho Seco. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 20 (citing\nTR at 186 (Ronningen)). Moreover, during the current claim period, some of the SNF handling\nequipment, including the transfer cask and the hydraulic ram, was not stored in the IOSB. Gov’t\nPost Tr. Resp. at 20 (citing TR at 190 (Ronningen)). Mr. Ronningen testified that SMUD installed\na new building on the ISFSI to store some of the handling equipment. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 20\n(citing TR at 189 (Ronningen)). For these reasons, SMUD has failed to demonstrate that the\nplanning, operation, and maintenance of the IOSB were necessitated by the presence of SNF at\nRancho Seco or that the same circumstances justifying recovery of IOSB costs in Docket No. 09-\n587C exist in this case. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 20.\n\n                        c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n       SMUD replies that the removal of Rancho Seco’s Class B and C waste is irrelevant to\nwhether SMUD can recover ISOB costs. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 12. In SMUD VIII, the court\nawarded IOSB costs, because it determined that the building was necessary to store contaminated\nhandling equipment that would not be onsite, if DOE performed the Standard Contract. Pl. Post\nTr. Reply at 12 (citing SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 684, 691). The court’s determination was not\nbased on the presence of Class B and C waste at Rancho Seco. P. Post Tr. Reply at 12.\n\n        In addition, the Government’s argument that SMUD stored uncontaminated handling\nequipment outside of the IOSB is irrelevant, because the IOSB is necessary to store contaminated\nhandling equipment, and Mr. Ronningen testified that all of SMUD’s contaminated equipment was\nstored there until 2015.

The installation of a new ISFSI building does not establish that SMUD’s\nprior use of the IOSB was inappropriate or unnecessary. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 13.\n\n                        d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n       The Government argues that DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract did not require\nSMUD to maintain the IOSB, because Rancho Seco’s Class B and C waste was removed by 2014,\nsome of the handling equipment was not stored in the IOSB during the entire claim period, and\nSMUD transferred the handling equipment to a permanent building within the ISFSI in 2015.\nGov’t Post Tr. Br. at 19–20. It is unclear whether the Government is arguing that: (1) SMUD’s\ncontinued use of the IOSB was not caused by the DOE’s partial breach; or (2) it was unreasonable\nfor SMUD to continue using the IOSB under the circumstances. Either way, the Government’s\nargument is not persuasive.\n\n        Regarding causation, the DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract was a substantial\nfactor in, if not the but-for cause of, SMUD’s use of the IOSB from 2010 to 2015. During that\ntime period, the IOSB was used to store Class B and C waste, and contaminated fuel handling\nequipment. TR at 57, 185. Mr. Ronningen, however, testified that SMUD would not have used\nthe IOSB from 2010 to 2015 if DOE had performed under the Standard Contract. TR at 60\n(Ronningen). The Government did not refute this testimony. In fact, Mr. Brewer agreed that\nSMUD would not have used the IOSB to store handling equipment, “because there would have\nbeen none.” TR at 254 (Brewer). And, refused to provide any opinion on whether the IOSB would\nhave been used to store Class B and C waste. TR at 254 (Brewer) (“Q. [Y]ou are not offering an\nopinion in this case that the B and C waste would have been onsite [after] 2009, is that correct?\nA. No, I’m not.”). In light of the Government’s failure to refute Mr. Ronningen’s testimony, the\ncourt has found that SMUD would not have operated the IOSB during the claim period if DOE\nremoved Rancho Seco’s SNF by 2004. In other words, DOE’s breach is the but-for cause of\nSMUD’s continued use of the IOSB.\n\n        Regarding reasonableness, a party that is mitigating damages from a breach is only required\nto “make those efforts that are fair and reasonable under the circumstances.” Home Savings of\nAm. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"212039\"><a href=\"/opinion/212039/home-savings-of-america-fsb-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting Robinson v.

The breaching party bears the burden of establishing that a\ncertain mitigation effort was unreasonable. See SMUD V, 293 F. App’x at 772 (“It is the\nGovernment’s burden to show that it was unreasonable for SMUD to pursue [certain efforts] to\nmitigate the Government’s breach); see also Tennessee Valley Auth. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

Moreover, SMUD was required to store contaminated\nhandling equipment in a licensed facility, such as the IOSB. TR at 59–60, 211 (Ronningen). And,\nthe equipment had to remain onsite, because an emergency might require the removal of an SNF\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\fcanister from the ISFSI. See SMUD VIII, 109 Fed. Cl. at 691. Moreover, SMUD must relicense\nthe ISFSI in the near future and, as part of that process, the handling equipment will be required\nonsite to move SNF canisters. TR at 93 (Ronningen). Therefore, SMUD had the choice between\nconstructing a permanent facility to store the contaminated equipment at Rancho Seco and storing\nit in the preexisting IOSB. SMUD decided to store the equipment in the IOSB from 2010 to 2015.\nTR at 189. The Government does not explain how the reasonableness of this decision depends on\nthe presence of Class B and C waste in the IOSB.\n\n        In addition, SMUD’s decision to store uncontaminated equipment outside of the IOSB is\nirrelevant. Mr. Ronningen testified that the IOSB was necessary to house contaminated handling\nequipment, such as the failed fuel grapple and the lifting yoke. TR at 211 (Ronningen). And, all\ncontaminated equipment was stored inside the IOSB during the claim period, except temporarily\nwhen SMUD moved the equipment out of the way, so it could dispose of the Class B and C waste\nthat was also stored there. TR at 58–59 (Ronningen). Finally, the Government does not explain\nwhy SMUD’s transfer of the handling equipment to a new ISFSI building after the claim period is\nrelevant to the reasonableness of SMUD’s use of the IOSB during that period.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to recover $980,500 for\ncosts incurred to operate, maintain and repair the IOSB, and refurbish the spent fuel handling\nequipment stored in the IOSB.\n\n               6.     Whether SMUD Is Entitled To Recover Brokerage Fees Incurred To\n                      Obtain ANI Insurance.\n\n                        a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD incurred insurance brokerage fees of $86,010 to obtain the nuclear insurance\nrequired by NRC regulations. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 24. These fees are the direct consequence of\nDOE’s partial breach of the June 14, 1983 Standard Contract and are just as recoverable as the\ncost of insurance, that the court awarded in SMUD VIII and SMUD X. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 24.\n\n         SMUD argues that it established entitlement to claimed brokerage fees with reasonable\ncertainty. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 25. At trial, SMUD presented the testimony of its insurance broker,\ni.e., “the person with the most credible knowledge about the brokerage fees.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at\n25. In addition, SMUD produced “numerous documents supporting its brokerage fees” and the\n“testimony of [Mr. Kenneth P. Metcalfe]22 evaluating and affirming the claimed costs.” Pl. Post\nTr. Br. at 25.\n\n\n\n       22\n           Mr. Kenneth P. Metcalfe is the Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Kenrich Group in\nWashington D.C. TR at 329. The Kenrich Group provides business consulting services, as well\nas the analysis and preparation of damages claims. TR at 330. Mr. Metcalfe’s expertise falls into\nthree main categories: (1) regulated industries and regulatory accounting; (2) government\ncontracts; and (3) economic damages in breach of contract disputes. TR at 330. Over his thirty-\nfour year career, Mr. Metcalfe has served as an expert witnesses in over two dozen nuclear fuel\ncases. TR at 333. In 1982, he graduated cum laude from Georgetown University School of\n\n\n                                               26\n\f         Mr. Derek Whipple is a Managing Director at Aon Risk Insurance Services West, Inc.\n(“Aon”). Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 25. He is “responsible for the brokerage services Aon provides SMUD\non all its policies, including its nuclear insurance.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 25 (citing PX 8 at 42\n(Deposition Testimony of Mr. Derek Whipple)). Mr. Whipple testified that, during the claim\nperiod, Aon charged SMUD a flat annual brokerage fee for its services. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 25\n(citing PX 8 at 65 (Whipple Deposition)). Aon determined SMUD’s annual fees in two contracts.\nThe first established SMUD’s fees from 2009 to 2014, and the second established fees from 2014\nto 2018. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 25 (citing PX 8 at 38, 65–66 (Whipple Deposition)). Mr. Whipple\ntestified that “[i]f SMUD no longer needed to purchase nuclear liability insurance, Aon would\ndecrease its annual brokerage fees to SMUD.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 26 (citing PX 8 at 72–74 (Whipple\nDeposition)). A conservative estimate of this decrease could be calculated by reducing SMUD’s\ncurrent fees by the percentage of SMUD’s ANI premiums to total insurance premiums. Pl. Post\nTr. Br. at 26 (citing PX 8 at 76, 81–84 (Whipple Deposition)).\n\n       In support of its claimed brokerage fees, calculated using Mr. Whipple’s conservative\nmethodology, SMUD produced both Aon contracts with supporting documents showing SMUD’s\nANI premiums and total premiums and information about the insurance programs that Aon\nbrokered for SMUD. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 27 (citing PX 1; PX 2; PX 3; PX 4; PX 5; PX 6; PX 12;\nPX 13; PX 14; PX 15; PX 16; PX 17; PX 18; PX 19; PX 44; PX 45; PX 46). In addition, Mr.\nWhipple’s testimony and the supporting documents produced by SMUD, establish SMUD’s\nclaimed brokerage fees with reasonable certainty. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 28.\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n        The Government responds that SMUD did not prove the claimed brokerage fees with\nreasonable certainty, because SMUD relied on a flawed estimate prepared by Mr. Whipple and\nMr. Metcalfe. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 24. Mr. Whipple’s testimony is not reliable, because “he\nlacks personal knowledge about the calculation of fees, and he did not [] consider all of the factors\nthat influence the price of brokerage services.” Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 24. Similarly, Mr.\nMetcalfe’s testimony is unreliable, because he relied on Mr. Whipple’s flawed methodology.\nGov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 24.\n\n       Mr. Whipple has no factual basis for assuming that Aon would decrease SMUD’s annual\nbrokerage fees, if SMUD no longer needed to purchase nuclear liability insurance. Gov’t Post Tr.\nResp. at 25. SMUD’s brokerage fees for the relevant claim period are established by a contract\nexecuted in 2009 and another contract executed in 2014. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 25. Mr. Whipple,\nhowever, began working for Aon in 2015. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 25. Moreover, “[d]espite the\nmultitude of parameters Aon used to determine [SMUD’s] brokerage fees, Mr. Whipple only used\n\n\nBusiness with a major in accounting. TR at 331. In addition, Mr. Metcalfe is a Certified Public\nAccountant in Virginia, a Certified Valuation Analyst and an Associate Certified Fraud Examiner.\nTR at 331. SMUD proffered Mr. Metcalfe as an expert in cost and regulatory accounting in the\nutility industry. TR at 337. The Government did not object to Mr. Metcalfe’s qualifications.\nAccordingly, the court has determined that Mr. Metcalfe is an expert in his respective field and\nqualified to testify as such. See Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fone[,] level of premiums[,] when he estimated the portion of brokerage fees attributable to the ANI\nnuclear liability insurance.” Gov’t Post Tr.

Therefore,\nSMUD is entitled to recover the costs of the brokerage fees. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 14. Any\nimprecision in the calculation of these fees falls on the Government, as the breaching party. Pl.\nPost Tr. Reply at 14.\n\n        The fact that Mr. Whipple, who serves as SMUD’s insurance broker, was not an Aon\nemployee at the time that SMUD and Aon signed the brokerage fee contracts is not material to\nwhether he has knowledge of the brokerage activities or fees incurred. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 15.\nMr. Whipple is a Senior Executive at Aon with over a decade of experience in the insurance\nbrokerage industry. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 15. His experience and understanding of brokerage fee\nnegotiations, as well as his familiarity with SMUD and its insurance requirements, provide him\nwith sufficient knowledge to credibly testify that SMUD’s annual brokerage fees would be lower\nin the non-breach world. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 15.\n\n       The fact that, Mr. Whipple did not address all factors relevant to brokerage fee negotiations\ndoes not undermine his testimony. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 16. Mr. Whipple admitted that there are\nmultiple ways to estimate SMUD’s brokerage fees, but those methods yield higher estimates. Pl.\nPost Tr. Reply at 16. Moreover, Mr. Whipple’s methodology is commonly used to calculate\nbrokerage fees. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 16.\n\n                         d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n        “The ascertainment of damages is not an exact science, and where responsibility for\ndamage is clear, it is not essential that the amount thereof be ascertainable with absolute exactness\nor mathematical precision: ‘It is enough if the evidence adduced is sufficient to enable a court or\njury to make a fair and reasonable approximation.’” Bluebonnet, 266 F.3d at 1355 (quoting Elec.\n& Missile Facilities, Inc. v.

Cl. 1960) (“Certainty is sufficient if the evidence\nadduced enables the court to make a fair and reasonable approximation of the damages.”).\n\n       In this case, SMUD produced sufficient evidence for the court to make a fair and reasonable\napproximation of the brokerage fees it incurred to purchase ANI insurance. As the Aon director\nresponsible for all of SMUD’s brokerage fees, Mr. Whipple was in a position to testify regarding\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fwhat portion of SMUD’s brokerage fees are attributable to ANI insurance. The fact that Mr.\nWhipple was not employed by Aon during the negotiation of SMUD’s brokerage fees for the\nrelevant time period does not undermine his credibility. It is reasonable to assume that the\nmanaging director in charge of SMUD’s brokerage fees would familiarize himself with the factors\nthat affect their pricing.\n\n       In addition, Mr. Whipple’s methodology provides the basis for a “fair and reasonable\napproximation” of SMUD’s ANI brokerage fees. See Bluebonnet, 266 F.3d at 1355 (emphasis\nadded). Mr. Whipple testified that his methodology provided a conservative estimate of SMUD’s\nbrokerage fees, because “[i]f SMUD were to obtain brokerage services on the open market, it could\nexpect to pay a commission equal to a fixed percentage of the premium amounts.” PX 9 at ¶ 7\n(Whipple Declaration). A typical commission ranges from 10% to 15%. PX 9 at ¶ 7 (Whipple\nDeclaration). But, even assuming a 10% rate, SMUD’s ANI brokerage fee would be much higher\nthan Mr. Whipple’s estimate. PX 9 at ¶ 7 (Whipple Declaration). The Government does not\ndispute Mr. Whipple’s methodology, except to argue that he did not consider all of the factors that\ncould have affected the pricing of SMUD’s brokerage fees. But, “certainty” does not require\nSMUD to consider all of the relevant factors. Indeed, it is not “essential that the [amount of\ndamages] be ascertainable with absolute exactness or mathematical precision. See Bluebonnet,\n266 F.3d at 1355. SMUD is only required to provide the basis for a “fair and reasonable\napproximation.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD satisfied this standard.\nAccordingly, SMUD is entitled to recover $86,010 for brokerage fees incurred to purchase ANI\ninsurance.\n\n               7.      Whether The Government Is Entitled To An Offset For Certain ANI\n                       Insurance Refunds That SMUD Received.\n\n                         a.      SMUD’s Argument.\n\n        SMUD also claims ANI insurance premiums from 2010 to 2015, because the Government\nis not entitled to a $682,397 offset for refunds that SMUD received between 2010 and 2014, for\npremiums that SMUD paid before 2004. Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 30. An offset based on these insurance\nrefunds would require the court to combine damages from this claim period with damages from an\nearlier claim period. See Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C (claiming breach of contract damages\nfor costs that SMUD incurred from 1992 to 2004). But, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit has held that combining damages from two separate claim periods violates “the\nsettled principle that a breaching party should never be placed in a better position as a result of its\nbreach.” Pl. Post Tr. Br. at 30 (quoting SMUD IX, 566 F. App’x at 996).\n\n                         b.      The Government’s Response.\n\n       The Government responds that SMUD’s ANI insurance claim should be offset by the full\namount of ANI refunds, received from 2010 to 2015, because these refunds lessen the financial\nimpact of paying premiums for those years. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 20. Moreover, the “premiums\nSMUD pays each year are not . . . segregated for a particular year.” Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 21.\n\n\n\n                                                  29\n\fInstead, the premiums go into a general fund that is used to pay claims, expenses and refunds.\nGov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 21. Refunds are calculated yearly. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 22.\n\n        In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that\nplaintiffs’ claims should reflect consideration of each claim period on its own. Gov’t Post Tr.\nResp. at 23 (citing Ind. Mich., 422 F.3d at 1376-78; Yankee Atomic, 536 F.3d at 1282). Therefore,\nall payments and refunds recorded from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015, should be included in\nthe court’s award of damages for that period. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 23. SMUD’s accounting\nsystem recorded ANI refunds as credits for the year that they were received. Gov’t Post Tr. Resp.\nat 23. But, SMUD’s damages claim does not reflect the full amount of those refunds. Gov’t Post\nTr. Resp. at 23. Accordingly, “SMUD overstated the cost it incurred between January 2010 and\nJune 2015 for ANI nuclear liability insurance . . . and [] should not be permitted to recover those\ncosts.” Gov’t Post Tr. Resp. at 23.\n\n                         c.      SMUD’s Reply.\n\n         SMUD replies that ANI refunds “reduce the net cost of insurance in the year the premium\nwas paid, not the year the refund was paid.” Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 17–18 (citing PX 33 at 111–12).\nIn fact, ANI distributes refunds on a pro rata basis only to those entities that paid a reserve premium\nten years before distribution. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 18 (citing PX 33 at 112, PC 32.002). Therefore,\nthe refunds paid to SMUD from 2009 to 2014 correspond to costs incurred between 2000 and\n2004. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 17. But, SMUD’s damages for the 1992–2004 claim period have\nalready been litigated in Civil Action Docket No. 98-488C. Accordingly, the court cannot award\nan offset that corresponds to that claim period. Pl. Post Tr. Reply at 19.\n\n                         d.      The Court’s Resolution.\n\n         In cases arising out of DOE’s partial breach of the Standard Contract, plaintiffs must\nlitigate damages in successive suits. See Indiana Michigan Power Co. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791864\"><a href=\"/opinion/791864/indiana-michigan-power-company-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1376–78 (Fed. Cir. 2005). This litigation structure limits plaintiffs’ ability to collect future\ndamages. Id. In SMUD IX, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that\n“this precedent also limits [the Government’s] ability to obtain future offsets.” SMUD IX, 566 F.\nApp’x at 996 (citing Indiana Michigan Power, 422 F.3d at 1377)). Our appellate court also ruled\nthat an order staying judgment in one damages period, pending an offset determination related to\na later damages period, constituted a constructive award of future offsets. Id.\n\n        SMUD argues that the Government’s claimed offset is prohibited by SMUD IX, because\n“it seeks to take costs from one period . . . and use them against SMUD in the later period.” Pl.\nPost Tr. Br. at 30. But, the appellate court’s holding in SMUD IX is based on the principle that the\nGovernment cannot recover future offsets. See SMUD IX, 566 F. App’x at 996 (emphasis added).\nIn this case, the Government is seeking an offset that was realized in the current damages period,\nalthough it related to damages incurred prior to this period.\n\n        For these reasons, the court has determined that the Government is entitled to a $682,397\noffset for ANI insurance refunds that SMUD received between 2010 and 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION.\n\n       For these reasons, the court has determined that SMUD is entitled to $28,867,161 in\ndamages to mitigate the Government’s partial breach of the Standard Contract from January 1,\n2010 to June 30, 2015. Accordingly, SMUD’s July 29, 2016 Motion For Partial Summary\nJudgment, pursuant to RCFC 56(a), is moot. The Clerk of the United States Court of Federal\nClaims is directed to enter final judgment in accordance with this Memorandum Opinion and Final\nOrder.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                   s/ Susan G.
