Paine, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of\nFlorida, sitting by designation.\n\f     The Dekalb County School District (the “School District” or\n\n“District”), seeks to vacate a permanent injunction prohibiting it\n\nfrom transferring a teacher, John Doe, who is infected with HIV,\n\nthe virus that causes AIDS. The School District wishes to transfer\n\nDoe from a classroom of children with severe behavioral\n\ndisorders, because it fears that Doe might have blood-to-blood\n\ncontact with one of his sometimes-violent students, thereby\n\ntransmitting HIV. After conducting a bench trial, the district court\n\ngranted Doe a permanent injunction under the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq, blocking his\n\ntransfer. The School District, however, argues that the district\n\ncourt failed to make adequate findings of fact regarding the effect\n\nof Doe’s illness on his qualifications and that Doe has not suffered\n\nan “adverse employment action.” We REVERSE, VACATE the\n\ninjunction, and REMAND for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                  2\n\f       The School District has three distinct levels of special\n\neducation programs for children with significant behavioral\n\ndisorders. First, the District maintains “interrelated” classrooms\n\nfor students with mild disorders; the District “mainstreams” these\n\nstudents for most of each school day. Second, the District has\n\n“self-contained” classrooms for children who are too “disordered”\n\nto participate in the interrelated program. Third, the District\n\noperates “psychoeducation” classrooms for students with the\n\nmost severe behavioral problems. From 1992 to 1995, John Doe\n\nwas a teacher at the District’s Shadow Rock Psychoeducational\n\nCenter (“Shadow Rock”).1\n\n       Children enrolled in the District’s psychoeducation classes\n\nare often aggressive. As the District established at trial, these\n\nchildren frequently engage in acts of violence such as biting,\n\nhitting, scratching, and kicking. Some children also attempt to\n\nbring dangerous items such as razors to school or to attack their\n\n       1\n       Like the district court, we have allowed the plaintiff-appellee to proceed under the\npseudonym “John Doe” in order to protect his privacy.\n\n                                                3\n\fclassmates or teachers with objects such as pencils. Because of\n\nthese potential dangers, psychoeducation teachers must be able\n\nto physically restrain their pupils; for example, a psychoeducation\n\nteacher may have to “basket hold” several students each day.\n\nOften, these confrontations result in injuries to teachers. Although\n\nthe number of scrapes and bruises suffered by teachers is\n\nunclear, psychoeducation teachers commonly file workman’s\n\ncompensation claims for significant injuries, and, at least once, a\n\nteacher has suffered a severe bite that drew blood and required\n\nmedical attention.\n\n     In February 1995, Doe told Shadow Rock’s principal that he\n\nwas HIV-positive, and the principal in turn informed other school\n\nadministrative personnel. Because District officials feared that\n\nviolence and subsequent blood-to-blood contact between Doe\n\nand one of his psychoeducation students might lead to\n\ntransmission of HIV, the District transferred Doe to an\n\n“interrelated” classroom at a different school in April 1995. The\n\n                                 4\n\fparties dispute whether this transfer was “voluntary”; the District\n\nemphasizes that Doe signed a transfer form, while Doe argues\n\nthat he had no choice but to sign and that he hoped that by doing\n\nso he might at least get to teach a “self-contained” rather than an\n\n“interrelated” class. While the district court’s finding regarding this\n\npoint is somewhat unclear, the court appears to have concluded\n\nthat the transfer was involuntary. In any case, Doe spent the\n\nmonths after his transfer trying to convince the District to return\n\nhim to his psychoeducation class, or, as an alternative, to assign\n\nhim to a group of “self-contained” children.\n\n     Although Doe would prefer to teach a psychoeducational\n\nrather than an interrelated class, his transfer does not appear to\n\nrepresent a demotion. Doe’s salary, benefits, and seniority all\n\nremain the same. Doe also enjoys the same relative level of\n\nprestige within the school system and the larger community. In\n\naddition, while Doe lacks a certificate from the State of Georgia in\n\ninterrelated teaching, his transfer does not seem likely to render\n\n                                   5\n\fobsolete his investment in his own education. Although Doe’s\n\nteaching experience has focused on psychoeducation, he does\n\nnot have a particularly specialized educational background. Doe\n\nholds a bachelor’s degree in psychology from New York\n\nUniversity and a master’s degree in special education from\n\nGeorgia State University.\n\n     Doe, however, does have a Georgia certificate in\n\npsychoeducational teaching but not in interrelated instruction. To\n\nobtain an interrelated certificate, Doe would have to complete ten\n\ncredit hours of coursework. In order to reduce any inconvenience\n\nthis additional study might pose to Doe, the District has allowed\n\nDoe three years to become certified and promised to pay his\n\neducational expenses. In addition, the District has suggested that\n\nDoe might be able to count his ten hours concerning interrelated\n\nteaching toward the continuing education total that he would have\n\nto achieve in any case to retain his current certification, though\n\nthis point is not clear in the current record. Even without the\n\n                                  6\n\finterrelated certificate, Doe appears qualified to teach an\n\ninterrelated class, since his interrelated pupils suffer from the\n\nsame sort of disorders as his previous psychoeducational\n\nstudents—his new students are just easier to teach because they\n\nare less prone to misbehavior. As Doe concedes, his new\n\ninterrelated position is less stressful. Significantly, Doe also\n\nagrees with the District that he will be more marketable as an\n\ninterrelated teacher (once he obtains his certificate), with more\n\nlong-term career opportunities, than he was before his transfer.\n\n     On August 1, 1995, Doe learned from the District’s Executive\n\nDirector of Personnel that he could not return to a\n\npsychoeducation setting or move to a self-contained classroom\n\nbecause of his HIV status. On August 3, 1995, Doe therefore\n\ntimely filed a discrimination charge with the federal Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) alleging that the\n\nDistrict was discriminating against him on the basis of his HIV\n\ndisability. After the EEOC issued Doe a right-to-sue letter, he\n\n                                   7\n\fbrought this action in the district court under both the ADA and the\n\nVocational Rehabilitation Act (“VRA”) 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq.\n\n       From July 28 through July 31, 1997, the district court held a\n\nbench trial on Doe’s claims. On August 1, 1997, the district court\n\nruled in Doe’s favor and issued a short written order containing\n\nterse findings of fact and conclusions of law. After noting that the\n\nparties agreed that Doe’s HIV infection rendered him disabled, the\n\ndistrict court found that “[t]he risk that plaintiff will transmit HIV to\n\nstudents with severe behavior disorders, including children who\n\nare prone to bite, is remote and theoretical.” R4-59 at 2, ¶ 11.\n\nThe court also found that Doe had suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action. The district court, however, made no attempt\n\nto explain the basis for its conclusion regarding the risk of HIV\n\ntransmission to Doe’s psychoeducation students, nor did the court\n\noffer any rationale for its assessment that Doe’s transfer was\n\n“adverse.”2 Whatever its underlying reasoning, the district court\n\n       2\n        The district court did list three findings of fact elsewhere in its order that it apparently\nthought were relevant to its holding that Doe’s transfer was adverse. First, the district court\n\n                                                   8\n\fissued a permanent injunction under the ADA requiring the School\n\nDistrict to reinstate Doe as a psychoeducational instructor.3\n\n\n\n                                      II. DISCUSSION\n\n       In order to prevail under the ADA, Doe must prove all three\n\nelements of his prima facie case by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.4 First, he must show that he has a disability.5 Second,\n\nhe must demonstrate that he is qualified to serve as a\n\npsychoeducation teacher, with or without some reasonable\n\naccommodation by the District, despite his disability. Third, he\n\nfound that “Plaintiff is certified to teach children with behavior disorders, and teaching in this\nfield has special meaning and significance to him.” R4-59 at 1, ¶ 11. Second, the district court\nobserved that “Plaintiff is not certified to teach in an interrelated program.” Id. at 2, ¶ 7. Third,\nthe district court stated that “Plaintiff did not wish to be moved from his classroom at Shadow\nRock . . . .” Id. at 2, ¶ 8.\n       3\n        The district court did not separately discuss Doe’s VRA claim.\n       4\n        On appeal, Doe does not argue that we should read the VRA to provide him with any\ncause of action or form of relief that is unavailable under the ADA. In fact, Doe makes no\narguments at all premised on the VRA. We, therefore, deem Doe’s VRA claim to have been\nabandoned, and we discuss his claim as if it arose solely under the ADA. See Allstate Ins. Co. v.\nSwann, 27 F.3d 1539, 1542 (11th Cir. 1994) (stating that issues not raised in a party’s brief are\nconsidered abandoned).\n       5\n        A person who is infected with HIV is “disabled” for purposes of the ADA, even if he has\nnot developed AIDS. See Bragdon v. Abbott, No. 97-156, __ U.S. __, __ S. Ct. __, __ L. Ed. 2d\n__ (June 25, 1998).\n\n                                                  9\n\fmust show that he has suffered an adverse employment action\n\nbecause of his disability (i.e., that he has suffered employment\n\ndiscrimination). See Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d\n\n516, 519, 523-24 (11th Cir. 1996) (discussing the elements of a\n\nprima facie case under the ADA).\n\n     The School District contends that the district court made two\n\ncritical errors in applying this framework. First, the District argues\n\nthat the court did not properly find or balance relevant safety\n\nfactors regarding Doe’s continued qualification for a\n\npsychoeducation position, as required by School Bd. of Nassau\n\nCounty v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307\n\n(1987). Second, the District maintains that its transfer of Doe was\n\nnot an “adverse employment action.” We review the district\n\ncourt’s findings of fact for clear error and its analysis of law de\n\nnovo. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); Simmons v. Conger, 86 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f1080, 1084 (11th Cir. 1996).6 We address each of the District’s\n\ncontentions in turn.\n\n\n\nA. WHETHER DOE IS QUALIFIED\n\n       In Arline, the Supreme Court considered whether a woman\n\nsuffering from tuberculosis was otherwise qualified to be an\n\nelementary schoolteacher. See generally Arline, 480 U.S. 273,\n\n107 S. Ct. 1123 (applying the VRA). Rather than establishing\n\nsome arbitrary rule regarding the relevance of contagious disease\n\nto teaching qualifications, the Court insisted that district courts\n\nundertake “individualized inquiry” in each case. Id. at 287, 107 S.\n\nCt. at 1130. This inquiry must include:\n\n       (a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is\n       transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the\n       carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the\n       potential harm to third parties), and (d) the probabilities\n       the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying\n       degrees of harm.\n\n       6\n        The School District concedes that, if Doe is disabled, is otherwise qualified, and has\nsuffered an adverse employment action, then a permanent injunction prohibiting Doe’s transfer\nbased on his HIV status would be appropriate.\n\n                                              11\n\fId. at 288, 107 S. Ct. at 1131 (quoting Amicus Curiae Brief of the\n\nAmerican Medical Association at 19). In making these findings, a\n\ndistrict court “normally should defer to the reasonable medical\n\njudgments of public health officials.” Id.\n\n     Once a district court has made the necessary medical\n\nfindings, it must weigh the statutory goal of ending disability-\n\nbased discrimination against any legitimate concerns regarding\n\n“significant health and safety risks.” Id. If the court finds that, on\n\nbalance, a plaintiff’s disability would render him unqualified for\n\nsafety reasons, then the court must consider whether the\n\nemployer can “reasonably accommodate” the plaintiff so that he\n\ncan perform “the essential functions” of the job in question. Id. at\n\n1131 & 1131 n.17 (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(k) (1985)). Finally,\n\nwhatever the district court’s legal conclusion regarding a claim of\n\ndisqualification due to safety concerns, the court must make\n\nexplicit both its findings of fact and its application of the law, so as\n\nto allow meaningful appellate review. See id.\n\n                                   12\n\f     In this case, the district court found, without explanation, that\n\nDoe’s HIV infection would pose only a “remote and theoretical”\n\nrisk to psychoeducational students. R4-59 at 2. Based on this\n\nsole finding and “[c]onsidering the four factors delineated in”\n\nArline, the district court relied on our opinion in Martinez v. School\n\nBd. of Hillsborough County, 861 F.2d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir. 1988),\n\nto hold that Doe is qualified to be a psychoeducation teacher. R4-\n\n59 at 3.\n\n     In Martinez, a school sought to segregate a mentally\n\nretarded child with AIDS from her classmates. Holding for the\n\nschool, the district court in Martinez concluded that a “‘remote\n\ntheoretical possibility’ of transmission” justified her total separation\n\nfrom other students. Martinez, 861 F.2d at 1506. On appeal, we\n\nreversed because the danger of transmission did not rise to the\n\n“‘significant’ risk level” required for the girl’s exclusion from a\n\nregular classroom. Id. In reversing the district court, however, we\n\ndid not simply direct entry of judgment for the disabled plaintiff.\n\n                                   13\n\fInstead, we observed that the district court had failed to make\n\nfactual findings regarding all four of the Arline factors (the district\n\ncourt had considered only the likelihood of transmission), and we\n\nremanded for further findings and an assessment of the overall\n\nrisk. See id. at 1506-07.\n\n       In the present case, the district court has not made any\n\nfactual findings that might enable us to engage in meaningful\n\nappellate review. As in Martinez and Arline, the district court has\n\nfailed to explain or justify the factual determinations underlying its\n\ndecision. It is not enough for the district court to invoke Martinez’s\n\nphrase regarding a “‘remote theoretical possibility’ of\n\ntransmission”. Instead, the district court should explain why it\n\nbelieves that the risk posed by Doe is “remote” and should make\n\nfindings of fact with respect to the Arline factors.7 Because the\n\ndistrict court’s factual findings are incomplete and its reasoning is\n\n\n       7\n         We do not mean to imply that we believe that Doe is not qualified. Because the district\ncourt has neither made sufficient findings of fact nor explained its legal reasoning, we are not\nable to assess whether Doe is “otherwise qualified” for a psychoeducation position.\n\n                                               14\n\funclear, we vacate the injunction and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for such further proceedings as it deems necessary\n\nfor entry of a more explicit rationale for its decision.8\n\n\n\nB. WHETHER DOE’S TRANSFER CONSTITUTED AN\nADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION\n\n       Under the ADA, no covered employer may discriminate\n\nagainst a qualified person because of his disability. See 42\n\n\n       8\n         We are also concerned about the nature of the legal standards applied by the district\ncourt, as evidenced by its comments in the record. For example, during the School District’s\nexamination of a witness, the district court stated to the parties that it was confused about what\nshould constitute relevant evidence and that it believed that the legal test for whether the School\nDistrict had violated the ADA was simply whether the District had acted “reasonably.” R7 at\n502. When counsel for both parties attempted to assist the court, the following exchange ensued:\n        PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL: Your Honor, may I interject? I don’t want you to get\n        mad at me for saying this, but I just want to real quickly state for the record how\n        the issue should be framed from the legal standpoint. The issue is not whether the\n        school board acted reasonably, but rather did they make an employment decision\n        on the basis of my client’s disability, and was he otherwise qualified to stay at\n        Shadow Rock or did he present a direct threat?\n\n       COURT: You can call it whatever you want to, but the bottom line is what I said.\n       Whether it’s based on his qualifications or otherwise, it’s whether they acted\n       reasonably.\n\n       PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL: Well, legally it’s based on –\n\n        COURT: All right. You worry about that if I rule against you and you can take it\n        up to the Eleventh Circuit.\nId. at 503. We would have preferred that the district court make a greater effort to ascertain the\nlegal basis for Doe’s action before it made evidentiary or other rulings.\n\n                                                15\n\fU.S.C. § 12112(a). More specifically, no covered employer may\n\nuse the disability of an otherwise qualified person as an excuse\n\nfor discrimination in hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation,\n\ntraining, or “other terms, conditions, and privileges of\n\nemployment.” Id. Thus, the ADA prohibits “a broad variety of\n\nadverse employment actions, whenever those actions are taken\n\nfor a prohibited reason.” McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99\n\nF.3d 1068, 1077 (11th Cir. 1996). Although we have never\n\nthoroughly examined what constitutes “adversity,” we have held\n\nthat a transfer may sometimes constitute an adverse action under\n\nthe ADA, see id. at 1078.\n\n     In this case, both parties agree that the School District\n\ntransferred Doe to an interrelated classroom because of his HIV\n\ndisability. The School District, however, argues that it has not\n\nunlawfully “discriminated” against Doe because an “objective,”\n\n“reasonable” person in Doe’s position would not have viewed the\n\ntransfer as an adverse employment action. Doe, though,\n\n                                  16\n\fmaintains that an employment action may be adverse for either\n\nobjective or subjective reasons. Doe therefore contends that his\n\ntransfer was adverse both because he has a deep, personal\n\ncommitment to psychoeducational instruction and because he\n\nwould have to undergo ten credit hours of instruction in order to\n\nobtain certification in interrelated teaching.\n\n       In its order, the district court did not explicitly adopt either an\n\nobjective or subjective standard, but instead simply stated, without\n\nexplanation, that “Plaintiff’s transfer to the interrelated resource\n\nprogram was an adverse employment action.” R4-59 at 3, ¶ 6. It\n\nseems likely, however, that the district court implicitly adopted\n\nDoe’s approach, since its only factual findings that might\n\nconceivably have supported this legal conclusion were that (1)\n\nDoe is not certified for interrelated teaching, (2) psychoeducation\n\n“has special meaning and significance to him,” and (3) his\n\ntransfer was involuntary. Id. at 1-2.9\n\n       9\n         Although the district court gave no explanation in its order for its conclusion that the\ntransfer was adverse, it did appear to state during the trial that its decision concerning adversity\n\n                                                 17\n\f       Before assessing Doe’s particular allegations, we must first\n\ndetermine the proper standard for evaluating his claims. As we\n\nnoted above, our circuit has not previously examined whether a\n\ncourt should view an employment action from the subjective\n\nperspective of a particular plaintiff or the objective perspective of a\n\n“reasonable person.” Our court has, though, considered\n\nallegations of “adverse employment actions” in a variety of\n\ncontexts, as have our sister circuits. See generally, e.g., H & W\n\nContracting, 102 F.3d at 523-24 (11th Cir. 1996) (discussing\n\nadverse employment action in the ADA context); Maddow v.\n\nProctor & Gamble Co., 107 F.3d 846, 852-53 (11th Cir. 1997)\n\n(discussing same under the Age Discrimination in Employment\n\nAct (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634); Collins v. State of Illinois,\n\n830 F.2d 692, 702-704 (7th Cir. 1987) (discussing same under\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq).\n\nBoth the ADEA and Title VII, for instance, use the same “terms\n\nwould turn on whether it found Doe’s transfer to have been voluntary or involuntary. See R8 at\n605.\n\n                                              18\n\fand conditions” language to proscribe discriminatory employment\n\npractices. Compare ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1), and Title VII,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) with ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).\n\nMoreover, our precedents interpreting these employment\n\ndiscrimination laws have often relied on the same “adverse\n\nemployment action” concept that is an essential element of a\n\nprima facie ADA case. See, e.g., Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852-53\n\n(ADEA); Collins, 830 F.2d at 702-04 (Title VII).10 We can assist\n\nour consideration of the adversity standard under the ADA,\n\ntherefore, by looking to the broader experience of our court and\n\nothers with employment discrimination law.\n\n       We begin our analysis of the law in this area by noting that\n\nwe have found no case, in this or any other circuit, in which a\n\ncourt explicitly relied on the subjective preferences of a plaintiff to\n\nhold that that plaintiff had suffered an adverse employment\n\n       10\n         An “adverse employment action” is also an element of two broad types of prima facie\ndiscrimination cases: (1) a prima facie circumstantial case, see Carter v. City of Miami, 870 F.2d\n578, 582 (11th Cir. 1989), and (2) a prima facie retaliation case, see Raney v. Vinson Guard\nServ., Inc., 120 F.3d 1192, 1196 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                                19\n\faction.11 Of course, in most employment discrimination cases the\n\nissue of a plaintiff’s subjective preference need not arise, because\n\nthe plaintiff has alleged an employment action that would appear\n\nadverse to any reasonable person. Where a plaintiff has allegedly\n\nsuffered termination, demotion, reduction in pay, loss of prestige,\n\nor diminishment of responsibilities, for example, a court normally\n\nhas no cause to consider its standard for adversity; the relevant\n\nquestion in such cases is whether such patently adverse actions\n\nactually took place. Cf., e.g., Eskra v. Provident Life and Accident\n\nIns. Co., 125 F.3d 1406, 1412 (11th Cir. 1997) (considering a\n\nreduction in income, but not mentioning the plaintiff’s subjective\n\npreferences, in ruling that a transfer was adverse).\n\n\n\n\n       11\n         In Collins, a panel of the Seventh Circuit did note that the plaintiff had been\n“transferred away from a job she enjoyed.” 830 F.3d at 704. The Collins court, however,\nappears to have based its determination that the plaintiff had suffered an adverse employment\naction on its finding that her employer had severely curtailed her job responsibilities. See id.\nMoreover, any intimation in Collins that a court should consider an employee’s subjective\npreference would seem to have been abandoned by the Seventh Circuit in later cases such as\nWilliams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 85 F.3d 270, 274 (1996) (holding that a “purely lateral\ntransfer” cannot be adverse), which we discuss below.\n\n                                                20\n\f     Recognizing this lack of precedent, Doe urges us to rely on\n\ntwo EEOC regulations interpreting the ADA. See 29 C.F.R. §§\n\n1630.4, 1630.5 (1998). As Doe correctly notes, we defer to a\n\nfederal agency’s reasonable interpretation of a law that Congress\n\nhas given it authority to administer. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844-45,\n\n104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782-83, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). The EEOC’s\n\nregulations, however, are of no assistance in this matter, because\n\nthey do not address whether we should use an objective or\n\nsubjective test to determine whether discrimination has occurred.\n\nIn 29 C.F.R. § 1630.4, the EEOC makes clear that an employer\n\nmay not “discriminate on the basis of disability against a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability in regard to . . . [a] transfer.” The\n\nEEOC’s regulation, however, does not state whether this\n\nprohibition on discrimination encompasses both objectively and\n\nsubjectively adverse actions. Section 1630.4, therefore, does\n\nnot provide us with any more guidance than our own precedent\n\n                                    21\n\festablishing that a transfer may sometimes constitute an\n\nadverse employment action. See McNely, 99 F.3d at 1078\n\n(holding that a transfer may be an adverse employment action).\n\nSimilarly, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.5 forbids employers from limiting,\n\nsegregating, or classifying an employee “in a way that adversely\n\naffects his or her employment opportunities,” yet does not specify\n\nwhat constitutes an adverse effect. As to both section 1630.4 and\n\nsection 1630.5, moreover, the EEOC’s “interpretive guidance”\n\nprovides no further help regarding whether we should employ an\n\nobjective or subjective standard. See generally 29 C.F.R. Pt.\n\n1630, App. §§ 1630.4, 1630.5 (1998).\n\n     Having determined that we are not bound to a subjective\n\nstandard, we adopt an objective test: An ADA plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would view\n\nthe employment action in question as adverse. In our view, this\n\ntest best reflects our employment discrimination doctrine and\n\nprecedents. First, although this court has never explicitly\n\n                                 22\n\faddressed the issue, our authorities do at least suggest an\n\nobjective approach. In National Cement Co. v. Federal Mine\n\nSafety and Health Review Comm’n, 27 F.3d 526 (11th Cir. 1994),\n\nwe considered whether a company had violated the Mine Act, 30\n\nU.S.C. § 815(c), when it transferred an employee who had\n\nrefused to do what he claimed was unreasonably dangerous\n\nwork. Because the employer had transferred the plaintiff to a\n\nhigher paying job, we ruled that it had not taken an unlawful\n\n“adverse action,” without considering whether the plaintiff might\n\nhave had a subjective preference for his previous position. See\n\nid. at 534.12 Moreover, we note that two district courts within our\n\ncircuit have ruled, in retaliation cases, that “an employment action\n\n. . . is not adverse merely because the employee dislikes it or\n\ndisagrees with it.” Perryman v. West, 949 F. Supp. 815, 819\n\n\n\n       12\n         Of course, we do not know whether the plaintiff in National Cement argued that his\nsubjective preference was sufficient, alone, to establish that his transfer was adverse. For this\nreason, National Cement is not controlling precedent. This same caveat applies to the various\nother suggestive authorities discussed in this opinion, since we have no way to determine\nwhether the issue of a subjective versus an objective standard was raised by the parties.\n\n                                                 23\n\f(M.D. Ala. 1996); accord McCoy v. Macon Water Auth., 966 F.\n\nSupp. 1209, 1220 (M.D. Ga. 1997). While these district court\n\ncases are not controlling, they are consistent with our court’s\n\nprevious observation that not “every unkind act” amounts to an\n\nadverse employment action. Wu v. Thomas, 996 F.2d 271, 273\n\nn.3 (11th Cir. 1993) (per curiam). At the same time, it seems\n\nsignificant that no panel of this circuit has ever listed a plaintiff’s\n\nparticular subjective preference as a basis for its holding that a\n\ntransfer was adverse.13\n\n       Outside our own circuit, persuasive authority suggests even\n\nmore strongly that we should use a reasonable person standard\n\nto determine whether a plaintiff has suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action. The Seventh Circuit, in particular, has\n\nrepeatedly declared that “a purely lateral transfer, that is, a\n\n\n\n       13\n         See generally Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852-53 (holding a transfer to be adverse); Eskra,\n125 F.3d at 1412 (same); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1563-64 (11th Cir. 1994) (same);\nBaker v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 903 F.2d 1515, 1519 (11th Cir. 1990) (per curiam) (same); see\nalso McNely, 99 F.3d at 1078 (holding that an transfer can constitute an adverse employment\naction under the ADA).\n\n                                             24\n\ftransfer that does not involve a demotion in form or substance,\n\ncannot rise to the level of a materially adverse employment\n\naction.” Williams, 85 F.3d at 274; see also Flaherty v. Gas\n\nResearch Inst., 31 F.3d 451, 457 (7th Cir. 1994); Crady v. Liberty\n\nNat’l Bank and Trust Co., 993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir. 1993);\n\nSpring v. Sheboygan Area Sch. Dist., 865 F.2d 883, 885-86 (7th\n\nCir. 1989). “Otherwise,” the Seventh Circuit has written, “every\n\ntrivial personnel action that an irritable, chip-on-the-shoulder\n\nemployee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination\n\nsuit.” Williams, 85 F.3d at 274.14 Thus, “not everything that\n\nmakes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action.”\n\nSee Smart v. Ball State Univ., 89 F.3d 437, 441 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n       Several other circuits, moreover, have agreed that a truly\n\nlateral transfer cannot be adverse. In Montandon v. Farmland\n\nIndustries, for example, the Eighth Circuit found that an allegedly\n\n       14\n          The Williams court also was concerned that, if purely lateral transfers were actionable,\nthen “[t]he Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, already staggering under an avalanche\nof filings too heavy for it to cope with, would be crushed, and serious complaints would be lost\namong the trivial.” Williams, 85 F.3d at 274.\n\n                                                25\n\fretaliatory transfer was not adverse because it “did not entail a\n\nchange in position, title, salary, or any other aspect of his\n\nemployment . . . .[,] [h]owever unpalatable the prospect [of the\n\ntransfer] may have been to him . . . .” 116 F.3d 355, 359 (8th Cir.\n\n1997); see also Harlston v. McDonnell Douglass Corp., 37 F.3d\n\n379, 382 (8th Cir. 1994). Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has held that\n\na nurse’s transfer was not adverse because it did not entail a loss\n\nof pay, duties, or prestige, see Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management,\n\nInc. 97 F.3d 876, 886 (6th Cir. 1996), while the Ninth Circuit has\n\nwritten that a plaintiff’s transfer amounted to “a subjective loss of\n\njob satisfaction rather than an adverse employment action,” see\n\nHorn v. County of San Diego, No. 96-55610, (9th Cir. Sept. 18,\n\n1997) (per curiam). Accord Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp.,\n\n113 F.3d 912, 919 n.3 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, __ U.S. __,\n\n118 S. Ct. 369, 139 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1997). At the same time, the\n\nThird Circuit has adopted Smart’s view that “not everything that\n\nmakes an employee unhappy” constitutes unlawful retaliation.\n\n                                  26\n\fRobinson v. City of Pittsburgh, 120 F.3d 1286, 1300 (3d Cir.\n\n1997) (“[R]etaliatory conduct must be serious and tangible enough\n\nto alter an employee’s compensation, terms, conditions, or\n\nprivileges of employment into . . . ‘adverse employment action.’”).\n\nThus, “[t]he clear trend of authority is to hold that” a purely lateral\n\ntransfer is not an adverse employment action. Ledergerber v.\n\nStangler, 122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir. 1997).\n\n       Of course, these cases do not articulate a reasonable person\n\nstandard, nor do they explicitly stand for the proposition that a\n\ncourt may not ever consider a plaintiff’s subjective preferences in\n\ndetermining whether his transfer is “purely lateral.”15\n\nNevertheless, they are, at a minimum, consistent with the\n\nobjective standard that we expressly adopt in this opinion. As in\n\nthe Eleventh Circuit, all of the cases that have found a transfer to\n\n       15\n         Often, in fact, these cases appear to leave the door open to adversity based on some\nsubjective preferences, through their use of language like that in Smart that “not everything that\nmakes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action.” Smart, 89 F.3d at 441 (emphasis\nadded). Unlike the hypothetical “chip-on-the-shoulder employee” in Williams, Doe has a\nsignificant, and deeply held, special commitment to psychoeducation for severely disordered\nchildren. Compare Williams, 85 F.3d at 274. This case, therefore, takes us a step beyond these\nauthorities.\n\n                                                27\n\fbe adverse appear to have based their conclusions on objective\n\nfactors. See, e.g., De la Cruz v. New York City Human\n\nResources Admin. Dep’t of Soc. Serv., 82 F.3d 16, 21 (2d Cir.\n\n1996) (transfer resulting in lessened prestige and professional\n\ngrowth); Torre v. Casio, Inc., 42 F.3d 825, 831 n.7 (3d Cir. 1994)\n\n(transfer to a dead-end job). In other words, our sister circuits\n\nhave only held transfers to be adverse where the transfers were\n\nobjectively equivalent, at least to some degree, to demotions.\n\n     Beyond these precedents from our sister circuits, we can\n\nalso look to related principles of employment discrimination law to\n\nfind support for the proposition that our test for adversity should\n\nbe an objective one. Under the doctrine of “constructive\n\ndischarge,” for example, “[t]he general rule is that if the employer\n\ndeliberately makes an employee’s working conditions so\n\nintolerable that the employee is forced into an involuntary\n\nresignation, then the employer . . . is as liable for any illegal\n\nconduct involved therein as if it had formally discharged the\n\n                                   28\n\faggrieved employee.” Young v. Southwestern Sav. and Loan\n\nAssoc., 509 F.2d 140, 144 (5th Cir. 1975). In assessing\n\nconstructive discharge claims, we do not consider a plaintiff’s\n\nsubjective feelings about his employer’s actions. Rather, we\n\ndetermine whether “a reasonable person in [the plaintiff’s] position\n\nwould be compelled to resign.” Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding,\n\nInc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1317 (11th Cir. 1989); accord, e.g., Serrano-\n\nCruz v. DFI Puerto Rico, Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(“We have long applied an ‘objective standard’ . . . .”); Kelleher v.\n\nFlawn, 761 F.2d 1079, 1086 (5th Cir. 1985) (“[S]ubjective\n\nimpressions as to the desirability of one position over another\n\ncannot control our decision.”) (quoting Lee v. Russell City Bd. of\n\nEduc., 563 F.2d 1159, 1162 (5th Cir. 1977)). Applying this\n\ndoctrine, Doe might have refused his transfer, resigned, and then\n\nsued for constructive discharge. Had he done so, however, he\n\nwould have had not only to meet a high threshold of adversity\n\n(“intolerability”); he would also have had to rely solely on objective\n\n                                  29\n\ffactors to make his case. Instead of quitting his job, though, Doe\n\naccepted the transfer and now seeks to prove that it was adverse\n\nthrough evidence of his personal preference for\n\npsychoeducational teaching. While our constructive discharge\n\nprecedents by no means control our decision in this case, it would\n\nseem strange and inconsistent for us to apply an objective\n\nstandard where a plaintiff rejects a transfer, resigns, and sues, but\n\nto apply a subjective standard where a plaintiff accepts a transfer\n\nand sues. Absent some justification for such a dichotomy, we\n\ndecline to introduce such a confusing inconsistency into the law.\n\n     At the same time, our adoption of an objective standard for\n\nclaims of an adverse employment action is consistent with our\n\ncurrent use of objective standards regarding employers’ claims\n\nand defenses. In the ADA context, for instance, we often inquire\n\nas to whether an employer has made a “reasonable\n\naccommodation” of its employee’s disability. In making this\n\ndetermination, we do not ask whether an employer has made all\n\n                                 30\n\fthe accommodations it feels are appropriate, or whether an\n\nemployer has made all the accommodations that a disabled\n\nplaintiff desires. See Stewart v. Happy Herman’s Cheshire\n\nBridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997). Instead, we\n\ndecide whether a requested accommodation “would impose an\n\nundue hardship on the employer.” Id. Similarly, we do not rely on\n\nan employer’s “feelings” regarding a person’s disability. See H &\n\nW Contracting, 102 F. 3d at 524. Nor do we consider the\n\nsubjective but unreasonable fear that a community may harbor\n\nregarding teachers with HIV. Cf. Martinez, 861 F.2d at 1505-06\n\n(reversing an order segregating a child with AIDS from her\n\nclassmates); Arline, 480 U.S. at 284, 107 S. Ct. at 1129\n\n(disregarding “society’s accumulated myths and fears about\n\ndisability and disease”).16\n\n\n\n\n       16\n         We also note that the Supreme Court has interpreted the “terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment” language of Title VII to require a sexual harassment plaintiff to show\nthat her work environment is objectively hostile. See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17,\n21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993).\n\n                                               31\n\f     Moreover, we have employed the adverse employment\n\naction concept as a means to avoid requiring plaintiffs to prove\n\nthe subjective, discriminatory intent of an employer. Often, a\n\nplaintiff claiming unlawful employment discrimination cannot\n\nproduce direct evidence of his employer’s intent. See Mayfield v.\n\nPatterson Pump Co., 101 F.3d 1371, 1375 (11th Cir. 1996). In\n\norder to allow plaintiffs to surmount this problem, the courts have\n\narticulated a set of elements that a plaintiff may prove to establish\n\na circumstantial prima facie case of discrimination. See\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct.\n\n1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Mayfield, 101 F.3d at 1375.\n\nAs we explained above, one of the elements that a plaintiff must\n\nshow to establish such a prima facie case is that he has suffered\n\nan adverse employment action. See Carter, 870 F.2d at 582.\n\nWere we to adopt Doe’s subjective test for adversity in this case,\n\nwe would create an odd situation in which a plaintiff could use the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas test not only to avoid having to prove directly\n\n                                 32\n\fhis employer’s discriminatory intent, but also to force his employer\n\nto either disprove the plaintiff’s own subjective feelings or concede\n\nan element of the plaintiff’s prima facie case.17 Though, again, the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas line of cases is not controlling, we are\n\nhesitant to introduce unnecessary inconsistency and confusion\n\ninto employment discrimination law.18\n\n       Returning more specifically to the ADA context, we also note\n\nthat our requirement that a plaintiff must show, as part of his\n\n\n\n       17\n         For instance, consider a case in which a school involuntarily transferred a female\nteacher from a seventh grade to an eighth grade class and then placed a male in her former\nposition. Even without direct evidence that the school harbored a gender-discriminatory intent,\nthe teacher could establish a prima facie circumstantial case by showing that (1) she was a\nmember of a protected class (women), (2) she was qualified to teach the seventh grade class, (3)\nher transfer was an adverse employment action, and (4) a member of an unprotected class filled\nher former position (the male teacher). Cf. Carter, 870 F.2d at 582. (stating the elements of a\nprima facie circumstantial case). Under Doe’s view, the teacher’s subjective preference for her\nformer seventh grade class would be sufficient to prove that she had suffered an adverse\nemployment action, so the school would have either to produce evidence that she did not\nsubjectively prefer her former position or to concede this element. Thus, the McDonnell\nDouglas test would excuse employees from producing direct evidence of their employers’\nsubjective intent but would require employers to produce such evidence of their employees’\nsubjective preferences.\n       18\n         In addition to rendering one element of the McDonnell Douglas test essentially moot, a\nsubjective standard would make the law less predictable for employers. Under an objective\nstandard, an employer can expect that it will not be liable for employment discrimination if it\ndoes not constrain its employees’ careers. Under a subjective standard, however, an employer\ncannot anticipate which employment actions a court will find to be adverse, because it cannot\nalways know what will make its employees “unhappy.”\n\n                                               33\n\fprima facie case, that he has suffered an adverse employment\n\naction would be essentially meaningless if we were to utilize a\n\nsubjective standard. In order for an honest plaintiff to go to the\n\ntrouble of suing his employer, he must be unhappy with some\n\naction that his employer has taken. Given this basic fact, a\n\nsubjective standard would mean that no court would ever\n\nseriously consider the adverse employment action prong of a\n\nprima facie ADA case—we could just assume this element to be\n\nsatisfied in every case. Even if we did not assume away the\n\nadversity requirement as a matter of course, a plaintiff could\n\nalways prove this part of his case by testifying that he was\n\nunhappy with whatever employment action had brought him into\n\ncourt; an employer could rarely rebut its employee’s statement of\n\nhis own subjective feelings.\n\n     Finally, we believe that the standard that we articulate today\n\nwill well serve the ADA’s goal of eliminating discrimination on\n\naccount of disability. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (“Findings\n\n                                 34\n\fand purpose”). By evaluating claims from the perspective of a\n\nreasonable person in the employee’s position, we will continue to\n\ninterpret the ADA to prohibit a wide range of job actions based on\n\nan employee’s disabled status. Transfers that result in lesser pay,\n\nresponsibilities, or prestige19 will still be “adverse.” See, e.g.,\n\nBaker 903 F.2d at 1519 (lesser pay); Collins, 830 F.2d at 704\n\n(lesser responsibilities); De la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21 (lesser\n\nprestige). So, too, will transfers that involve arduous travel or that\n\nimpede an employee’s professional growth or advancement. See,\n\ne.g., Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852 (travel); De la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21\n\n(professional growth); Torre, 42 F.3d at 831 n.7 (advancement).\n\nIn other words, our reasonable person standard will continue to\n\n\n\n       19\n          In at least two cases, the Seventh Circuit has stated or implied that loss of prestige did\nnot make a transfer adverse. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457; Spring, 865 F.2d at 886. It is\nsomewhat unclear in these cases whether the court was holding that a loss of prestige was\noutweighed by other factors, was not significant, or was irrelevant. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457;\nSpring, 865 F.2d at 886. Regardless, we believe that loss of prestige, either within an\norganization or with regard to the general public, is an objective factor that a court should\nconsider as part of the reasonable person test. Cf. De la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21. Beyond the loss of\nprestige itself (a reasonable if egoistic employee goal much like salary or promotion),\ndiminishment of prestige may also affect an employee’s marketability, another significant\nobjective factor.\n\n                                                35\n\fprotect disabled employees from transfers that are a form of\n\ndemotion or that disrupt investment in education, training, or\n\nseniority.\n\n       Turning to the specific facts of the present case, we are\n\nunable to determine from the current record whether Doe has\n\nsuffered an adverse transfer. As we have explained, Doe’s\n\nsubjective preference for a psychoeducation position is not\n\nrelevant to our inquiry. Although we greatly admire Doe’s\n\ncommitment to teaching such tragically disordered children, we do\n\nnot consider the special meaning that he ascribes to his former\n\njob.\n\n       The question that remains, then, is whether a reasonable\n\nperson in Doe’s position would have viewed as adverse the\n\nrequirement that Doe complete ten credit hours (over three years)\n\nto obtain certification in interrelated teaching. To support his\n\nargument that this transfer-induced obligation is adverse, Doe\n\ncites Rodriguez v. Board of Educ. of Eastchester Union Free Sch.\n\n                                  36\n\fDist., 620 F.2d 362 (2d Cir. 1980). In that Title VII case, a school\n\ndistrict allegedly transferred a female, middle school, art teacher\n\nto an elementary school as part of its policy of segregating female\n\nart teachers into elementary education. See id. at 364-66. Prior\n\nto her transfer, the teacher had not only had twenty years of\n\nexperience in teaching middle school art classes but had also\n\nreceived a doctoral degree in art education; her doctoral thesis\n\nwas entitled “A Model Arts Program for the Middle School of\n\nEastchester School District Number 1.” See id. After examining\n\nthe school district’s action, the Rodriguez court concluded that the\n\nteacher had suffered an adverse transfer because “substantially\n\nuncontradicted evidence indicated that the art programs at the\n\nelementary level were so profoundly different from those in the\n\njunior high school as to render utterly useless her twenty years of\n\nexperience and study in developing art programs for middle\n\nschool children.” Id. at 366. This “severe professional . . .\n\n\n\n                                 37\n\ftrauma,” the court held, constituted an adverse, sex-based\n\ninterference with a condition or privilege of employment. See id.\n\n       The facts of Doe’s case, however, are quite different. Unlike\n\nthe plaintiff in Rodriguez, Doe’s transfer does not substantially\n\nobviate a specialized education; Doe does not have a bachelor’s\n\nor higher degree that is less applicable to interrelated education\n\nthan it is to psychoeducation. Although Doe’s transfer would\n\ndisrupt his investment in his current Georgia certificate, his\n\ntransfer from a psychoeducational to an interrelated classroom is\n\nnot nearly as dramatic as Rodriguez’s move from a middle school\n\nto an elementary school.20 In other words, Doe may not have\n\nsuffered the “severe professional trauma” evident in Rodriguez,\n\nthough his transfer undoubtedly represented a “personal” setback.\n\n       Still, Doe does not need to show that his transfer would\n\nrepresent a “severe trauma” to a reasonable person in his\n\n\n       20\n         Although not mentioned in the Rodriguez opinion, such a transfer from a middle to an\nelementary school might also be thought to involve a significant loss of prestige, and perhaps\nlong-term prospects for advancement in the art education field as well.\n\n                                              38\n\fposition. Instead, he needs only to show that his transfer was, on\n\nthe whole, objectively adverse. Any adversity must be material; it\n\nis not enough that a transfer imposes some de minimis\n\ninconvenience or alteration of responsibilities.21 See Crady, 993\n\nF.2d at 136. Moreover, the fact that an employee must learn as a\n\nresult of a transfer does not mean that the transfer is per se\n\nadverse. See Williams, 85 F.3d at 274. In Williams, for example,\n\nthe court held that a salesman’s transfer to a different product line\n\nwas not adverse, despite the fact that he had to learn more new\n\nproducts than he would have if he had stayed put. See id.\n\n(concluding that the salesman’s loss of commission income while\n\nhe learned about new products did not render his transfer\n\n       21\n           It is important not to make a federal case out of a transfer that is de minimis, causing no\nobjective harm and reflecting a mere chip-on-the-shoulder complaint. However, it is equally\nimportant that the threshold for what constitutes an adverse employment action not be elevated\nartificially, because an employer’s action, to the extent that it is deemed not to rise to the level of\nan adverse employment action, is removed completely from any scrutiny for discrimination. In\nother words, where the cause or motivation for the employer’s action was clearly its employee’s\ndisability, a finding that the action does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action\nmeans that the action is not scrutinized for discrimination. An artificially high threshold for\nwhat constitutes an adverse employment action would undermine the purposes of the statute by\npermitting discriminatory actions to escape scrutiny. We believe that the purposes of the statute\nare appropriately served by requiring the fact finder to determine whether a reasonable person\nwould consider the action adverse under all the facts and circumstances.\n\n                                                  39\n\fadverse). As the Williams court observed, all transfers require\n\nsome learning, since they require employees to work with new\n\npeople or products and to assume new responsibilities. See id.\n\nThus, any coursework requirements for Doe must rise to a level\n\nthat a reasonable person would deem materially adverse, taking\n\ninto account both the pros and cons of such required education.\n\n       In sum, Doe must demonstrate that a reasonable person in\n\nhis position would have found his transfer to be adverse under all\n\nthe facts and circumstances. Unfortunately, the district court has\n\nnot made sufficient findings with regard to any of these factors for\n\nus to undertake a meaningful review. Therefore, we have decided\n\nto remand the case to the district court for such proceedings as it\n\ndeems necessary for it to enter explicit findings of fact concerning\n\nthe allegedly adverse nature of Doe’s transfer.22 Once having\n\n       22\n          The district court should make relevant subsidiary findings of fact, as well as an\nultimate finding of fact as to whether a reasonable person in Doe’s position would have found\nthe transfer to be adverse under all the facts and circumstances. Without in any way limiting the\nsubject matter of appropriate findings, the following would seem to be relevant: what is entailed\nin the coursework required for certification in the new position; would such additional\ncertification increase Doe’s career opportunities, and, if so, was such additional certification and\nresulting increase in opportunities available to Doe in any event, or was this available to Doe\n\n                                                 40\n\fmade these explicit findings, the district court should clearly\n\nexplain why it believes that a reasonable person in Doe’s position\n\nwould or would not have found the transfer to have been an\n\nadverse employment action.\n\n       In determining whether Doe’s transfer was adverse, the\n\ndistrict court should not rely on its determination that the transfer\n\nwas involuntary. In saying this, we do not mean to disturb the\n\ndistrict court’s finding on this issue but rather to make clear that\n\nthe voluntary or involuntary nature of the transfer is not relevant to\n\nthe question of whether it was unlawfully adverse. Of course, a\n\nfinding that Doe’s transfer was purely voluntary would have been\n\ndispositive in the School District’s favor; a transfer cannot be\n\n“because of a disability” if it occurred as the result of an\n\nemployee’s own request. Cf. Stewart v. Board of Trustees of the\n\nonly because of the transfer; whether the District’s action would in effect limit Doe’s\nopportunities in this school district to the teaching of interrelated classes, and/or foreclose other\nopportunities, and, if so, whether the same would adversely affect Doe’s employment\nopportunities or status within either this particular school district or the field of special education\ngenerally, see 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.5 (1998); and considering all of the relevant\nsubsidiary findings, whether a reasonable person in Doe’s position would consider the transfer to\nbe adverse.\n\n                                                  41\n\fKemper County Sch. Dist., 585 F.2d 1285, 1289 (5th Cir. 1978)\n\n(voluntary transfer not unlawful under Title VII); Hooper v.\n\nMaryland, No. 94-1067, (5th Cir. Jan. 10, 1995); Devine v.\n\nThalhimers, No. 92-1084, (4th Cir. Oct. 16, 1992). The fact that\n\nDoe’s transfer was involuntary, however, does not in any way\n\nestablish that it was legally adverse. Cf. Williams, 85 F.3d at 274\n\n(finding an “involuntary” transfer to be non-adverse). If a\n\nreasonable person in Doe’s position would have viewed the\n\ntransfer as non-adverse, the district court should not consider\n\nDoe’s subjective, personal preference for his prior position.\n\n\n\n                         III. CONCLUSION\n\n     We review in this case an injunction under the ADA that\n\nprohibits the School District from transferring Doe out of the\n\nDistrict’s psychoeducation program because of his infection with\n\nHIV. To establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Doe must\n\nprove that he has a disability; that he is otherwise qualified to\n\n                                  42\n\fteach psychoeducation, with or without some reasonable\n\naccommodation; and that he has suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action because of his HIV status (i.e., that the School\n\nDistrict has discriminated against him because of his disability).\n\n     To determine whether Doe is qualified, the district court\n\nshould have found and weighed the four factors explained in\n\nArline. The district court, however, failed to make explicit findings\n\nof fact regarding any dangers that Doe’s illness might pose to\n\nviolent psychoeducation students. In addition, the district court\n\nerred by applying a subjective standard for determining whether\n\nDoe’s transfer was adverse. Moreover, because the district court\n\ndid not enter explicit findings of fact or conclusions of law with\n\nregard to those aspects of Doe’s transfer that might render it\n\nobjectively adverse, we believe that it would be imprudent for us\n\nto attempt to assess whether the School District subjected Doe to\n\nan adverse employment action.\n\n\n\n                                  43\n\f     Therefore, we REVERSE the district court’s judgment,\n\nVACATE the injunction, and REMAND the case to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 44\n\f",

Paine, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of\nFlorida, sitting by designation.\n\f     The Dekalb County School District (the “School District” or\n\n“District”), seeks to vacate a permanent injunction prohibiting it\n\nfrom transferring a teacher, John Doe, who is infected with HIV,\n\nthe virus that causes AIDS. The School District wishes to transfer\n\nDoe from a classroom of children with severe behavioral\n\ndisorders, because it fears that Doe might have blood-to-blood\n\ncontact with one of his sometimes-violent students, thereby\n\ntransmitting HIV. After conducting a bench trial, the district court\n\ngranted Doe a permanent injunction under the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq, blocking his\n\ntransfer. The School District, however, argues that the district\n\ncourt failed to make adequate findings of fact regarding the effect\n\nof Doe’s illness on his qualifications and that Doe has not suffered\n\nan “adverse employment action.” We REVERSE, VACATE the\n\ninjunction, and REMAND for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                  2\n\f       The School District has three distinct levels of special\n\neducation programs for children with significant behavioral\n\ndisorders. First, the District maintains “interrelated” classrooms\n\nfor students with mild disorders; the District “mainstreams” these\n\nstudents for most of each school day. Second, the District has\n\n“self-contained” classrooms for children who are too “disordered”\n\nto participate in the interrelated program. Third, the District\n\noperates “psychoeducation” classrooms for students with the\n\nmost severe behavioral problems. From 1992 to 1995, John Doe\n\nwas a teacher at the District’s Shadow Rock Psychoeducational\n\nCenter (“Shadow Rock”).1\n\n       Children enrolled in the District’s psychoeducation classes\n\nare often aggressive. As the District established at trial, these\n\nchildren frequently engage in acts of violence such as biting,\n\nhitting, scratching, and kicking. Some children also attempt to\n\nbring dangerous items such as razors to school or to attack their\n\n       1\n       Like the district court, we have allowed the plaintiff-appellee to proceed under the\npseudonym “John Doe” in order to protect his privacy.\n\n                                                3\n\fclassmates or teachers with objects such as pencils. Because of\n\nthese potential dangers, psychoeducation teachers must be able\n\nto physically restrain their pupils; for example, a psychoeducation\n\nteacher may have to “basket hold” several students each day.\n\nOften, these confrontations result in injuries to teachers. Although\n\nthe number of scrapes and bruises suffered by teachers is\n\nunclear, psychoeducation teachers commonly file workman’s\n\ncompensation claims for significant injuries, and, at least once, a\n\nteacher has suffered a severe bite that drew blood and required\n\nmedical attention.\n\n     In February 1995, Doe told Shadow Rock’s principal that he\n\nwas HIV-positive, and the principal in turn informed other school\n\nadministrative personnel. Because District officials feared that\n\nviolence and subsequent blood-to-blood contact between Doe\n\nand one of his psychoeducation students might lead to\n\ntransmission of HIV, the District transferred Doe to an\n\n“interrelated” classroom at a different school in April 1995. The\n\n                                 4\n\fparties dispute whether this transfer was “voluntary”; the District\n\nemphasizes that Doe signed a transfer form, while Doe argues\n\nthat he had no choice but to sign and that he hoped that by doing\n\nso he might at least get to teach a “self-contained” rather than an\n\n“interrelated” class. While the district court’s finding regarding this\n\npoint is somewhat unclear, the court appears to have concluded\n\nthat the transfer was involuntary. In any case, Doe spent the\n\nmonths after his transfer trying to convince the District to return\n\nhim to his psychoeducation class, or, as an alternative, to assign\n\nhim to a group of “self-contained” children.\n\n     Although Doe would prefer to teach a psychoeducational\n\nrather than an interrelated class, his transfer does not appear to\n\nrepresent a demotion. Doe’s salary, benefits, and seniority all\n\nremain the same. Doe also enjoys the same relative level of\n\nprestige within the school system and the larger community. In\n\naddition, while Doe lacks a certificate from the State of Georgia in\n\ninterrelated teaching, his transfer does not seem likely to render\n\n                                   5\n\fobsolete his investment in his own education. Although Doe’s\n\nteaching experience has focused on psychoeducation, he does\n\nnot have a particularly specialized educational background. Doe\n\nholds a bachelor’s degree in psychology from New York\n\nUniversity and a master’s degree in special education from\n\nGeorgia State University.\n\n     Doe, however, does have a Georgia certificate in\n\npsychoeducational teaching but not in interrelated instruction. To\n\nobtain an interrelated certificate, Doe would have to complete ten\n\ncredit hours of coursework. In order to reduce any inconvenience\n\nthis additional study might pose to Doe, the District has allowed\n\nDoe three years to become certified and promised to pay his\n\neducational expenses. In addition, the District has suggested that\n\nDoe might be able to count his ten hours concerning interrelated\n\nteaching toward the continuing education total that he would have\n\nto achieve in any case to retain his current certification, though\n\nthis point is not clear in the current record. Even without the\n\n                                  6\n\finterrelated certificate, Doe appears qualified to teach an\n\ninterrelated class, since his interrelated pupils suffer from the\n\nsame sort of disorders as his previous psychoeducational\n\nstudents—his new students are just easier to teach because they\n\nare less prone to misbehavior. As Doe concedes, his new\n\ninterrelated position is less stressful. Significantly, Doe also\n\nagrees with the District that he will be more marketable as an\n\ninterrelated teacher (once he obtains his certificate), with more\n\nlong-term career opportunities, than he was before his transfer.\n\n     On August 1, 1995, Doe learned from the District’s Executive\n\nDirector of Personnel that he could not return to a\n\npsychoeducation setting or move to a self-contained classroom\n\nbecause of his HIV status. On August 3, 1995, Doe therefore\n\ntimely filed a discrimination charge with the federal Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) alleging that the\n\nDistrict was discriminating against him on the basis of his HIV\n\ndisability. After the EEOC issued Doe a right-to-sue letter, he\n\n                                   7\n\fbrought this action in the district court under both the ADA and the\n\nVocational Rehabilitation Act (“VRA”) 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq.\n\n       From July 28 through July 31, 1997, the district court held a\n\nbench trial on Doe’s claims. On August 1, 1997, the district court\n\nruled in Doe’s favor and issued a short written order containing\n\nterse findings of fact and conclusions of law. After noting that the\n\nparties agreed that Doe’s HIV infection rendered him disabled, the\n\ndistrict court found that “[t]he risk that plaintiff will transmit HIV to\n\nstudents with severe behavior disorders, including children who\n\nare prone to bite, is remote and theoretical.” R4-59 at 2, ¶ 11.\n\nThe court also found that Doe had suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action. The district court, however, made no attempt\n\nto explain the basis for its conclusion regarding the risk of HIV\n\ntransmission to Doe’s psychoeducation students, nor did the court\n\noffer any rationale for its assessment that Doe’s transfer was\n\n“adverse.”2 Whatever its underlying reasoning, the district court\n\n       2\n        The district court did list three findings of fact elsewhere in its order that it apparently\nthought were relevant to its holding that Doe’s transfer was adverse. First, the district court\n\n                                                   8\n\fissued a permanent injunction under the ADA requiring the School\n\nDistrict to reinstate Doe as a psychoeducational instructor.3\n\n\n\n                                      II. DISCUSSION\n\n       In order to prevail under the ADA, Doe must prove all three\n\nelements of his prima facie case by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.4 First, he must show that he has a disability.5 Second,\n\nhe must demonstrate that he is qualified to serve as a\n\npsychoeducation teacher, with or without some reasonable\n\naccommodation by the District, despite his disability. Third, he\n\nfound that “Plaintiff is certified to teach children with behavior disorders, and teaching in this\nfield has special meaning and significance to him.” R4-59 at 1, ¶ 11. Second, the district court\nobserved that “Plaintiff is not certified to teach in an interrelated program.” Id. at 2, ¶ 7. Third,\nthe district court stated that “Plaintiff did not wish to be moved from his classroom at Shadow\nRock . . . .” Id. at 2, ¶ 8.\n       3\n        The district court did not separately discuss Doe’s VRA claim.\n       4\n        On appeal, Doe does not argue that we should read the VRA to provide him with any\ncause of action or form of relief that is unavailable under the ADA.

Id. at 287, 107 S.\n\nCt. at 1130. This inquiry must include:\n\n       (a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is\n       transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the\n       carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the\n       potential harm to third parties), and (d) the probabilities\n       the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying\n       degrees of harm.\n\n       6\n        The School District concedes that, if Doe is disabled, is otherwise qualified, and has\nsuffered an adverse employment action, then a permanent injunction prohibiting Doe’s transfer\nbased on his HIV status would be appropriate.\n\n                                              11\n\fId. at 288, 107 S.

In making these findings, a\n\ndistrict court “normally should defer to the reasonable medical\n\njudgments of public health officials.” Id.\n\n     Once a district court has made the necessary medical\n\nfindings, it must weigh the statutory goal of ending disability-\n\nbased discrimination against any legitimate concerns regarding\n\n“significant health and safety risks.” Id. If the court finds that, on\n\nbalance, a plaintiff’s disability would render him unqualified for\n\nsafety reasons, then the court must consider whether the\n\nemployer can “reasonably accommodate” the plaintiff so that he\n\ncan perform “the essential functions” of the job in question.

R4-\n\n59 at 3.\n\n     In Martinez, a school sought to segregate a mentally\n\nretarded child with AIDS from her classmates. Holding for the\n\nschool, the district court in Martinez concluded that a “‘remote\n\ntheoretical possibility’ of transmission” justified her total separation\n\nfrom other students. Martinez, 861 F.2d at 1506. On appeal, we\n\nreversed because the danger of transmission did not rise to the\n\n“‘significant’ risk level” required for the girl’s exclusion from a\n\nregular classroom. Id. In reversing the district court, however, we\n\ndid not simply direct entry of judgment for the disabled plaintiff.\n\n                                   13\n\fInstead, we observed that the district court had failed to make\n\nfactual findings regarding all four of the Arline factors (the district\n\ncourt had considered only the likelihood of transmission), and we\n\nremanded for further findings and an assessment of the overall\n\nrisk. See id. at 1506-07.\n\n       In the present case, the district court has not made any\n\nfactual findings that might enable us to engage in meaningful\n\nappellate review. As in Martinez and Arline, the district court has\n\nfailed to explain or justify the factual determinations underlying its\n\ndecision. It is not enough for the district court to invoke Martinez’s\n\nphrase regarding a “‘remote theoretical possibility’ of\n\ntransmission”. Instead, the district court should explain why it\n\nbelieves that the risk posed by Doe is “remote” and should make\n\nfindings of fact with respect to the Arline factors.7 Because the\n\ndistrict court’s factual findings are incomplete and its reasoning is\n\n\n       7\n         We do not mean to imply that we believe that Doe is not qualified. Because the district\ncourt has neither made sufficient findings of fact nor explained its legal reasoning, we are not\nable to assess whether Doe is “otherwise qualified” for a psychoeducation position.\n\n                                               14\n\funclear, we vacate the injunction and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for such further proceedings as it deems necessary\n\nfor entry of a more explicit rationale for its decision.8\n\n\n\nB. WHETHER DOE’S TRANSFER CONSTITUTED AN\nADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION\n\n       Under the ADA, no covered employer may discriminate\n\nagainst a qualified person because of his disability. See 42\n\n\n       8\n         We are also concerned about the nature of the legal standards applied by the district\ncourt, as evidenced by its comments in the record. For example, during the School District’s\nexamination of a witness, the district court stated to the parties that it was confused about what\nshould constitute relevant evidence and that it believed that the legal test for whether the School\nDistrict had violated the ADA was simply whether the District had acted “reasonably.” R7 at\n502. When counsel for both parties attempted to assist the court, the following exchange ensued:\n        PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL: Your Honor, may I interject? I don’t want you to get\n        mad at me for saying this, but I just want to real quickly state for the record how\n        the issue should be framed from the legal standpoint. The issue is not whether the\n        school board acted reasonably, but rather did they make an employment decision\n        on the basis of my client’s disability, and was he otherwise qualified to stay at\n        Shadow Rock or did he present a direct threat?\n\n       COURT: You can call it whatever you want to, but the bottom line is what I said.\n       Whether it’s based on his qualifications or otherwise, it’s whether they acted\n       reasonably.\n\n       PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL: Well, legally it’s based on –\n\n        COURT: All right. You worry about that if I rule against you and you can take it\n        up to the Eleventh Circuit.\nId. at 503. We would have preferred that the district court make a greater effort to ascertain the\nlegal basis for Doe’s action before it made evidentiary or other rulings.\n\n                                                15\n\fU.S.C. § 12112(a). More specifically, no covered employer may\n\nuse the disability of an otherwise qualified person as an excuse\n\nfor discrimination in hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation,\n\ntraining, or “other terms, conditions, and privileges of\n\nemployment.” Id. Thus, the ADA prohibits “a broad variety of\n\nadverse employment actions, whenever those actions are taken\n\nfor a prohibited reason.” McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728966\"><a href=\"/opinion/728966/bernard-f-mcnely-v-ocala-star-banner-corporation-a-florida-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1077 (11th Cir. 1996). Although we have never\n\nthoroughly examined what constitutes “adversity,” we have held\n\nthat a transfer may sometimes constitute an adverse action under\n\nthe ADA, see id. at 1078.\n\n     In this case, both parties agree that the School District\n\ntransferred Doe to an interrelated classroom because of his HIV\n\ndisability. The School District, however, argues that it has not\n\nunlawfully “discriminated” against Doe because an “objective,”\n\n“reasonable” person in Doe’s position would not have viewed the\n\ntransfer as an adverse employment action. Doe, though,\n\n                                  16\n\fmaintains that an employment action may be adverse for either\n\nobjective or subjective reasons. Doe therefore contends that his\n\ntransfer was adverse both because he has a deep, personal\n\ncommitment to psychoeducational instruction and because he\n\nwould have to undergo ten credit hours of instruction in order to\n\nobtain certification in interrelated teaching.\n\n       In its order, the district court did not explicitly adopt either an\n\nobjective or subjective standard, but instead simply stated, without\n\nexplanation, that “Plaintiff’s transfer to the interrelated resource\n\nprogram was an adverse employment action.” R4-59 at 3, ¶ 6. It\n\nseems likely, however, that the district court implicitly adopted\n\nDoe’s approach, since its only factual findings that might\n\nconceivably have supported this legal conclusion were that (1)\n\nDoe is not certified for interrelated teaching, (2) psychoeducation\n\n“has special meaning and significance to him,” and (3) his\n\ntransfer was involuntary. Id. at 1-2.9\n\n       9\n         Although the district court gave no explanation in its order for its conclusion that the\ntransfer was adverse, it did appear to state during the trial that its decision concerning adversity\n\n                                                 17\n\f       Before assessing Doe’s particular allegations, we must first\n\ndetermine the proper standard for evaluating his claims. As we\n\nnoted above, our circuit has not previously examined whether a\n\ncourt should view an employment action from the subjective\n\nperspective of a particular plaintiff or the objective perspective of a\n\n“reasonable person.” Our court has, though, considered\n\nallegations of “adverse employment actions” in a variety of\n\ncontexts, as have our sister circuits. See generally, e.g., H & W\n\nContracting, 102 F.3d at 523-24 (11th Cir. 1996) (discussing\n\nadverse employment action in the ADA context); Maddow v.\n\nProctor & Gamble Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736305\"><a href=\"/opinion/736305/cecile-l-maddow-individually-and-on-behalf-of-those-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 852-53 (11th Cir. 1997)\n\n(discussing same under the Age Discrimination in Employment\n\nAct (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634); Collins v.

Compare ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1), and Title VII,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) with ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).\n\nMoreover, our precedents interpreting these employment\n\ndiscrimination laws have often relied on the same “adverse\n\nemployment action” concept that is an essential element of a\n\nprima facie ADA case. See, e.g., Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852-53\n\n(ADEA); Collins, 830 F.2d at 702-04 (Title VII).10 We can assist\n\nour consideration of the adversity standard under the ADA,\n\ntherefore, by looking to the broader experience of our court and\n\nothers with employment discrimination law.\n\n       We begin our analysis of the law in this area by noting that\n\nwe have found no case, in this or any other circuit, in which a\n\ncourt explicitly relied on the subjective preferences of a plaintiff to\n\nhold that that plaintiff had suffered an adverse employment\n\n       10\n         An “adverse employment action” is also an element of two broad types of prima facie\ndiscrimination cases: (1) a prima facie circumstantial case, see Carter v.

Where a plaintiff has allegedly\n\nsuffered termination, demotion, reduction in pay, loss of prestige,\n\nor diminishment of responsibilities, for example, a court normally\n\nhas no cause to consider its standard for adversity; the relevant\n\nquestion in such cases is whether such patently adverse actions\n\nactually took place. Cf., e.g., Eskra v. Provident Life and Accident\n\nIns.

The EEOC’s\n\nregulations, however, are of no assistance in this matter, because\n\nthey do not address whether we should use an objective or\n\nsubjective test to determine whether discrimination has occurred.\n\nIn 29 C.F.R. § 1630.4, the EEOC makes clear that an employer\n\nmay not “discriminate on the basis of disability against a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability in regard to . . . [a] transfer.” The\n\nEEOC’s regulation, however, does not state whether this\n\nprohibition on discrimination encompasses both objectively and\n\nsubjectively adverse actions. Section 1630.4, therefore, does\n\nnot provide us with any more guidance than our own precedent\n\n                                    21\n\festablishing that a transfer may sometimes constitute an\n\nadverse employment action. See McNely, 99 F.3d at 1078\n\n(holding that a transfer may be an adverse employment action).\n\nSimilarly, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.5 forbids employers from limiting,\n\nsegregating, or classifying an employee “in a way that adversely\n\naffects his or her employment opportunities,” yet does not specify\n\nwhat constitutes an adverse effect. As to both section 1630.4 and\n\nsection 1630.5, moreover, the EEOC’s “interpretive guidance”\n\nprovides no further help regarding whether we should employ an\n\nobjective or subjective standard. See generally 29 C.F.R. Pt.\n\n1630, App. §§ 1630.4, 1630.5 (1998).\n\n     Having determined that we are not bound to a subjective\n\nstandard, we adopt an objective test: An ADA plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would view\n\nthe employment action in question as adverse. In our view, this\n\ntest best reflects our employment discrimination doctrine and\n\nprecedents. First, although this court has never explicitly\n\n                                 22\n\faddressed the issue, our authorities do at least suggest an\n\nobjective approach. In National Cement Co. v.

Because the employer had transferred the plaintiff to a\n\nhigher paying job, we ruled that it had not taken an unlawful\n\n“adverse action,” without considering whether the plaintiff might\n\nhave had a subjective preference for his previous position. See\n\nid. at 534.12 Moreover, we note that two district courts within our\n\ncircuit have ruled, in retaliation cases, that “an employment action\n\n. . . is not adverse merely because the employee dislikes it or\n\ndisagrees with it.” Perryman v.

Applying this\n\ndoctrine, Doe might have refused his transfer, resigned, and then\n\nsued for constructive discharge. Had he done so, however, he\n\nwould have had not only to meet a high threshold of adversity\n\n(“intolerability”); he would also have had to rely solely on objective\n\n                                  29\n\ffactors to make his case. Instead of quitting his job, though, Doe\n\naccepted the transfer and now seeks to prove that it was adverse\n\nthrough evidence of his personal preference for\n\npsychoeducational teaching. While our constructive discharge\n\nprecedents by no means control our decision in this case, it would\n\nseem strange and inconsistent for us to apply an objective\n\nstandard where a plaintiff rejects a transfer, resigns, and sues, but\n\nto apply a subjective standard where a plaintiff accepts a transfer\n\nand sues. Absent some justification for such a dichotomy, we\n\ndecline to introduce such a confusing inconsistency into the law.\n\n     At the same time, our adoption of an objective standard for\n\nclaims of an adverse employment action is consistent with our\n\ncurrent use of objective standards regarding employers’ claims\n\nand defenses. In the ADA context, for instance, we often inquire\n\nas to whether an employer has made a “reasonable\n\naccommodation” of its employee’s disability. In making this\n\ndetermination, we do not ask whether an employer has made all\n\n                                 30\n\fthe accommodations it feels are appropriate, or whether an\n\nemployer has made all the accommodations that a disabled\n\nplaintiff desires.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973); Mayfield, 101 F.3d at 1375.\n\nAs we explained above, one of the elements that a plaintiff must\n\nshow to establish such a prima facie case is that he has suffered\n\nan adverse employment action. See Carter, 870 F.2d at 582.\n\nWere we to adopt Doe’s subjective test for adversity in this case,\n\nwe would create an odd situation in which a plaintiff could use the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas test not only to avoid having to prove directly\n\n                                 32\n\fhis employer’s discriminatory intent, but also to force his employer\n\nto either disprove the plaintiff’s own subjective feelings or concede\n\nan element of the plaintiff’s prima facie case.17 Though, again, the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas line of cases is not controlling, we are\n\nhesitant to introduce unnecessary inconsistency and confusion\n\ninto employment discrimination law.18\n\n       Returning more specifically to the ADA context, we also note\n\nthat our requirement that a plaintiff must show, as part of his\n\n\n\n       17\n         For instance, consider a case in which a school involuntarily transferred a female\nteacher from a seventh grade to an eighth grade class and then placed a male in her former\nposition. Even without direct evidence that the school harbored a gender-discriminatory intent,\nthe teacher could establish a prima facie circumstantial case by showing that (1) she was a\nmember of a protected class (women), (2) she was qualified to teach the seventh grade class, (3)\nher transfer was an adverse employment action, and (4) a member of an unprotected class filled\nher former position (the male teacher). Cf. Carter, 870 F.2d at 582. (stating the elements of a\nprima facie circumstantial case). Under Doe’s view, the teacher’s subjective preference for her\nformer seventh grade class would be sufficient to prove that she had suffered an adverse\nemployment action, so the school would have either to produce evidence that she did not\nsubjectively prefer her former position or to concede this element. Thus, the McDonnell\nDouglas test would excuse employees from producing direct evidence of their employers’\nsubjective intent but would require employers to produce such evidence of their employees’\nsubjective preferences.\n       18\n         In addition to rendering one element of the McDonnell Douglas test essentially moot, a\nsubjective standard would make the law less predictable for employers. Under an objective\nstandard, an employer can expect that it will not be liable for employment discrimination if it\ndoes not constrain its employees’ careers. Under a subjective standard, however, an employer\ncannot anticipate which employment actions a court will find to be adverse, because it cannot\nalways know what will make its employees “unhappy.”\n\n                                               33\n\fprima facie case, that he has suffered an adverse employment\n\naction would be essentially meaningless if we were to utilize a\n\nsubjective standard. In order for an honest plaintiff to go to the\n\ntrouble of suing his employer, he must be unhappy with some\n\naction that his employer has taken. Given this basic fact, a\n\nsubjective standard would mean that no court would ever\n\nseriously consider the adverse employment action prong of a\n\nprima facie ADA case—we could just assume this element to be\n\nsatisfied in every case. Even if we did not assume away the\n\nadversity requirement as a matter of course, a plaintiff could\n\nalways prove this part of his case by testifying that he was\n\nunhappy with whatever employment action had brought him into\n\ncourt; an employer could rarely rebut its employee’s statement of\n\nhis own subjective feelings.\n\n     Finally, we believe that the standard that we articulate today\n\nwill well serve the ADA’s goal of eliminating discrimination on\n\naccount of disability. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (“Findings\n\n                                 34\n\fand purpose”). By evaluating claims from the perspective of a\n\nreasonable person in the employee’s position, we will continue to\n\ninterpret the ADA to prohibit a wide range of job actions based on\n\nan employee’s disabled status. Transfers that result in lesser pay,\n\nresponsibilities, or prestige19 will still be “adverse.” See, e.g.,\n\nBaker 903 F.2d at 1519 (lesser pay); Collins, 830 F.2d at 704\n\n(lesser responsibilities); De la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21 (lesser\n\nprestige). So, too, will transfers that involve arduous travel or that\n\nimpede an employee’s professional growth or advancement. See,\n\ne.g., Maddow, 107 F.3d at 852 (travel); De la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21\n\n(professional growth); Torre, 42 F.3d at 831 n.7 (advancement).\n\nIn other words, our reasonable person standard will continue to\n\n\n\n       19\n          In at least two cases, the Seventh Circuit has stated or implied that loss of prestige did\nnot make a transfer adverse. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457; Spring, 865 F.2d at 886. It is\nsomewhat unclear in these cases whether the court was holding that a loss of prestige was\noutweighed by other factors, was not significant, or was irrelevant. See Flaherty, 31 F.3d at 457;\nSpring, 865 F.2d at 886. Regardless, we believe that loss of prestige, either within an\norganization or with regard to the general public, is an objective factor that a court should\nconsider as part of the reasonable person test. Cf. De la Cruz, 82 F.3d at 21. Beyond the loss of\nprestige itself (a reasonable if egoistic employee goal much like salary or promotion),\ndiminishment of prestige may also affect an employee’s marketability, another significant\nobjective factor.\n\n                                                35\n\fprotect disabled employees from transfers that are a form of\n\ndemotion or that disrupt investment in education, training, or\n\nseniority.\n\n       Turning to the specific facts of the present case, we are\n\nunable to determine from the current record whether Doe has\n\nsuffered an adverse transfer. As we have explained, Doe’s\n\nsubjective preference for a psychoeducation position is not\n\nrelevant to our inquiry. Although we greatly admire Doe’s\n\ncommitment to teaching such tragically disordered children, we do\n\nnot consider the special meaning that he ascribes to his former\n\njob.\n\n       The question that remains, then, is whether a reasonable\n\nperson in Doe’s position would have viewed as adverse the\n\nrequirement that Doe complete ten credit hours (over three years)\n\nto obtain certification in interrelated teaching. To support his\n\nargument that this transfer-induced obligation is adverse, Doe\n\ncites Rodriguez v. Board of Educ. of Eastchester Union Free Sch.\n\n                                  36\n\fDist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377811\"><a href=\"/opinion/377811/22-fair-emplpraccas-1259-23-empl-prac-dec-p-30921-carmen-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1980). In that Title VII case, a school\n\ndistrict allegedly transferred a female, middle school, art teacher\n\nto an elementary school as part of its policy of segregating female\n\nart teachers into elementary education. See id. at 364-66. Prior\n\nto her transfer, the teacher had not only had twenty years of\n\nexperience in teaching middle school art classes but had also\n\nreceived a doctoral degree in art education; her doctoral thesis\n\nwas entitled “A Model Arts Program for the Middle School of\n\nEastchester School District Number 1.” See id. After examining\n\nthe school district’s action, the Rodriguez court concluded that the\n\nteacher had suffered an adverse transfer because “substantially\n\nuncontradicted evidence indicated that the art programs at the\n\nelementary level were so profoundly different from those in the\n\njunior high school as to render utterly useless her twenty years of\n\nexperience and study in developing art programs for middle\n\nschool children.” Id. at 366. This “severe professional . . .\n\n\n\n                                 37\n\ftrauma,” the court held, constituted an adverse, sex-based\n\ninterference with a condition or privilege of employment. See id.\n\n       The facts of Doe’s case, however, are quite different. Unlike\n\nthe plaintiff in Rodriguez, Doe’s transfer does not substantially\n\nobviate a specialized education; Doe does not have a bachelor’s\n\nor higher degree that is less applicable to interrelated education\n\nthan it is to psychoeducation. Although Doe’s transfer would\n\ndisrupt his investment in his current Georgia certificate, his\n\ntransfer from a psychoeducational to an interrelated classroom is\n\nnot nearly as dramatic as Rodriguez’s move from a middle school\n\nto an elementary school.20 In other words, Doe may not have\n\nsuffered the “severe professional trauma” evident in Rodriguez,\n\nthough his transfer undoubtedly represented a “personal” setback.\n\n       Still, Doe does not need to show that his transfer would\n\nrepresent a “severe trauma” to a reasonable person in his\n\n\n       20\n         Although not mentioned in the Rodriguez opinion, such a transfer from a middle to an\nelementary school might also be thought to involve a significant loss of prestige, and perhaps\nlong-term prospects for advancement in the art education field as well.\n\n                                              38\n\fposition. Instead, he needs only to show that his transfer was, on\n\nthe whole, objectively adverse. Any adversity must be material; it\n\nis not enough that a transfer imposes some de minimis\n\ninconvenience or alteration of responsibilities.21 See Crady, 993\n\nF.2d at 136. Moreover, the fact that an employee must learn as a\n\nresult of a transfer does not mean that the transfer is per se\n\nadverse. See Williams, 85 F.3d at 274. In Williams, for example,\n\nthe court held that a salesman’s transfer to a different product line\n\nwas not adverse, despite the fact that he had to learn more new\n\nproducts than he would have if he had stayed put. See id.\n\n(concluding that the salesman’s loss of commission income while\n\nhe learned about new products did not render his transfer\n\n       21\n           It is important not to make a federal case out of a transfer that is de minimis, causing no\nobjective harm and reflecting a mere chip-on-the-shoulder complaint. However, it is equally\nimportant that the threshold for what constitutes an adverse employment action not be elevated\nartificially, because an employer’s action, to the extent that it is deemed not to rise to the level of\nan adverse employment action, is removed completely from any scrutiny for discrimination. In\nother words, where the cause or motivation for the employer’s action was clearly its employee’s\ndisability, a finding that the action does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action\nmeans that the action is not scrutinized for discrimination. An artificially high threshold for\nwhat constitutes an adverse employment action would undermine the purposes of the statute by\npermitting discriminatory actions to escape scrutiny. We believe that the purposes of the statute\nare appropriately served by requiring the fact finder to determine whether a reasonable person\nwould consider the action adverse under all the facts and circumstances.\n\n                                                  39\n\fadverse). As the Williams court observed, all transfers require\n\nsome learning, since they require employees to work with new\n\npeople or products and to assume new responsibilities. See id.\n\nThus, any coursework requirements for Doe must rise to a level\n\nthat a reasonable person would deem materially adverse, taking\n\ninto account both the pros and cons of such required education.\n\n       In sum, Doe must demonstrate that a reasonable person in\n\nhis position would have found his transfer to be adverse under all\n\nthe facts and circumstances. Unfortunately, the district court has\n\nnot made sufficient findings with regard to any of these factors for\n\nus to undertake a meaningful review. Therefore, we have decided\n\nto remand the case to the district court for such proceedings as it\n\ndeems necessary for it to enter explicit findings of fact concerning\n\nthe allegedly adverse nature of Doe’s transfer.22 Once having\n\n       22\n          The district court should make relevant subsidiary findings of fact, as well as an\nultimate finding of fact as to whether a reasonable person in Doe’s position would have found\nthe transfer to be adverse under all the facts and circumstances. Without in any way limiting the\nsubject matter of appropriate findings, the following would seem to be relevant: what is entailed\nin the coursework required for certification in the new position; would such additional\ncertification increase Doe’s career opportunities, and, if so, was such additional certification and\nresulting increase in opportunities available to Doe in any event, or was this available to Doe\n\n                                                 40\n\fmade these explicit findings, the district court should clearly\n\nexplain why it believes that a reasonable person in Doe’s position\n\nwould or would not have found the transfer to have been an\n\nadverse employment action.\n\n       In determining whether Doe’s transfer was adverse, the\n\ndistrict court should not rely on its determination that the transfer\n\nwas involuntary. In saying this, we do not mean to disturb the\n\ndistrict court’s finding on this issue but rather to make clear that\n\nthe voluntary or involuntary nature of the transfer is not relevant to\n\nthe question of whether it was unlawfully adverse. Of course, a\n\nfinding that Doe’s transfer was purely voluntary would have been\n\ndispositive in the School District’s favor; a transfer cannot be\n\n“because of a disability” if it occurred as the result of an\n\nemployee’s own request. Cf. Stewart v. Board of Trustees of the\n\nonly because of the transfer; whether the District’s action would in effect limit Doe’s\nopportunities in this school district to the teaching of interrelated classes, and/or foreclose other\nopportunities, and, if so, whether the same would adversely affect Doe’s employment\nopportunities or status within either this particular school district or the field of special education\ngenerally, see 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.5 (1998); and considering all of the relevant\nsubsidiary findings, whether a reasonable person in Doe’s position would consider the transfer to\nbe adverse.\n\n                                                  41\n\fKemper County Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360402\"><a href=\"/opinion/360402/18-fair-emplpraccas-1526-18-empl-prac-dec-p-8718-eugene-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289 (5th Cir. 1978)\n\n(voluntary transfer not unlawful under Title VII); Hooper v.\n\nMaryland, No. 94-1067, (5th Cir. Jan. 10, 1995); Devine v.\n\nThalhimers, No. 92-1084, (4th Cir. Oct. 16, 1992). The fact that\n\nDoe’s transfer was involuntary, however, does not in any way\n\nestablish that it was legally adverse. Cf. Williams, 85 F.3d at 274\n\n(finding an “involuntary” transfer to be non-adverse). If a\n\nreasonable person in Doe’s position would have viewed the\n\ntransfer as non-adverse, the district court should not consider\n\nDoe’s subjective, personal preference for his prior position.\n\n\n\n                         III. CONCLUSION\n\n     We review in this case an injunction under the ADA that\n\nprohibits the School District from transferring Doe out of the\n\nDistrict’s psychoeducation program because of his infection with\n\nHIV. To establish a prima facie case under the ADA, Doe must\n\nprove that he has a disability; that he is otherwise qualified to\n\n                                  42\n\fteach psychoeducation, with or without some reasonable\n\naccommodation; and that he has suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action because of his HIV status (i.e., that the School\n\nDistrict has discriminated against him because of his disability).\n\n     To determine whether Doe is qualified, the district court\n\nshould have found and weighed the four factors explained in\n\nArline. The district court, however, failed to make explicit findings\n\nof fact regarding any dangers that Doe’s illness might pose to\n\nviolent psychoeducation students. In addition, the district court\n\nerred by applying a subjective standard for determining whether\n\nDoe’s transfer was adverse. Moreover, because the district court\n\ndid not enter explicit findings of fact or conclusions of law with\n\nregard to those aspects of Doe’s transfer that might render it\n\nobjectively adverse, we believe that it would be imprudent for us\n\nto attempt to assess whether the School District subjected Doe to\n\nan adverse employment action.\n\n\n\n                                  43\n\f     Therefore, we REVERSE the district court’s judgment,\n\nVACATE the injunction, and REMAND the case to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 44\n\f</pre>",
