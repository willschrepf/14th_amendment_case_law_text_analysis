(“Kwal”), claiming Kwal discriminated against her on the\n\nbasis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title\n\nVII”) and the Equal Pay Act (“EPA”). Kwal moved for summary judgment,\n\narguing there was no evidence to support a cognizable discrimination claim\n\n\n       *\n        This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n       **\n         The Honorable Paul G. Cassell, United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Utah, sitting by designation.\n\fagainst Kwal. After a thorough analysis, the district court granted Kwal’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment and dismissed Ms. Block’s claims. Ms. Block appeals the\n\ndismissal of her Title VII claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\n\nand we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                    Background\n\n      The district court’s order contains a detailed recitation of the relevant facts.\n\nWe therefore only summarize them briefly for our discussion. Ms. Block worked\n\nas an employee at Kwal, a Colorado paint manufacturer and distributor, from\n\nDecember 1996 to January 2001. Prior to working at Kwal, Ms. Block primarily\n\nworked in an administrative capacity and had no prior experience in the paint\n\nindustry. She was initially hired to assist both the marketing and sales\n\norganizations in administrative matters. Ms. Block’s initial salary was $11 per\n\nhour, although, as a result of periodic raises, she was making $15.25 per hour in\n\nJanuary 2001, or $31,720 per year based on a forty hour work week. Aplt. App.\n\nat 38, 298. Ms. Block often worked overtime–900 hours in 2000–and was\n\ncompensated at a rate of time and a half for those hours over forty in a given\n\nworkweek. Id. at 140, 241-42.\n\n      Mike Dennis, who Ms. Block argues was paid more for similar work, was\n\nhired by Kwal in 1995 and held various sales positions, including Salesman,\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fAssistant Manager, Sales Representative, Sales Manager, and Store Manager. Mr.\n\nDennis had 31 prior years of experience in the paint industry when he was hired at\n\nKwal. Mr. Dennis also received various pay raises, and as of February 2001, he\n\nearned $48,000 per year. Id. at 39, 299. As a salaried employee, Mr. Dennis did\n\nnot receive overtime, although he worked on average sixty to sixty-five hours per\n\nweek. Id. at 184.\n\n      From 1998 until January 2001, Ms. Block was the Administrative Assistant\n\nfor both the sales and marketing departments. In this capacity, her duties\n\nincluded contact with customers regarding complaints and requests, processing\n\nmail, developing various programs, and coordinating special events. In this\n\nposition, Ms. Block reported to Thomas Stemple, the Vice President of Sales, and\n\nBryan Roughton, the Vice President of Business Development. Because Ms.\n\nBlock expressed an interest in focusing solely on marketing, the decision was\n\nmade to shift Ms. Block’s sales duties to someone in the sales department so she\n\ncould focus exclusively on marketing. As a result, Mr. Stemple interviewed Mr.\n\nDennis for the administrative assistant for sales/stores position. In this position,\n\nMr. Dennis was to continue to have a sales territory, take over some of the\n\nresponsibilities Ms. Block had been covering for the sales department, and\n\nassume some of Mr. Stemple’s responsibilities as well. Mr. Stemple offered the\n\nposition to Mr. Dennis in mid-January 2001, with the change in status to be\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\feffective February 5, and Mr. Dennis accepted.\n\n      On January 16, 2001, Mr. Roughton informed Ms. Block that she would be\n\nreceiving a promotion and that she would be working exclusively in the marketing\n\ndepartment. Ms. Block was to be paid an additional $2 per hour, making her total\n\nannual compensation $35,880 exclusive of overtime, with the potential for an\n\nadditional raise in April 2001 after she took on some additional duties. On\n\nJanuary 26, while in Mr. Stemple’s office, Ms. Block saw a “Change of Status”\n\nreport on his desk that indicated Mr. Dennis’s change in position and proposed\n\ncompensation of $48,000. As a result of this discovery, on January 30, 2001, Ms.\n\nBlock approached Kwal’s Human Resource Director, Sandy Long, and\n\ncomplained about the differences in salaries.\n\n      The next morning, January 31, Ms. Block spoke to Mr. Roughton and\n\ninformed him she would not stay at Kwal unless she also received a salary of\n\n$48,000. After Mr. Roughton informed her he was unable to pay her more than\n\nher previously discussed salary due to budgetary restraints, Ms. Block went to her\n\ndesk and drafted a resignation letter. She gave the letter to Ms. Long and Mr.\n\nRoughton at approximately 8:10 a.m. Aplt. App. at 371. She refused to speak\n\nwith Ms. Long, cleared her desk, and left the office.\n\n      On February 1, Ms. Block met with Ms. Long and Miles Tunno, Kwal’s\n\npresident. Mr. Tunno informed Ms. Block that he would accept her resignation.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fShe refused to update Mr. Roughton on the status of her work, and she left the\n\nmeeting. After filing a complaint with the EEOC, Ms. Block filed this action\n\nagainst Kwal, alleging various claims under Title VII and the EPA.\n\n      Ms. Block asserts the district court erred in (1) holding she failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of sex-based pay discrimination under Title VII, (2)\n\nholding she was not constructively discharged, and (3) failing to hold a trial on\n\nthe issues of damages and attorney’s fees under Title VII.\n\n\n\n                                     Discussion\n\n      We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\n“applying the same standards used by the district court.” Byers v. City of\n\nAlbuquerque, 150 F.3d 1271, 1274 (10th Cir. 1998). Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n\n477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). “The factual record and reasonable inferences\n\ntherefore are viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary\n\njudgment.” Byers, 150 F.3d at 1274.\n\n      Ms. Block first appeals the district court’s dismissal of her Title VII sex-\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fbased pay discrimination claim. Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer\n\n“to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . . sex,” or\n\n“to limit, segregate, or classify his employees . . . in any way which would\n\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities” because\n\nof the individual’s sex. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2). “In a Title VII case, the\n\ninitial burden is on the employee to make a prima facie showing of discrimination\n\nby the employer.” Nulf v. Int’l Paper Co., 656 F.2d 553, 557 (10th Cir. 1981)\n\n(citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)). Ms.\n\nBlock must establish a prima facie case of sex-based pay discrimination “by\n\nshowing that she occupies a job similar to that of higher paid males.” Sprague v.\n\nThorn Americas, Inc., 129 F.3d 1355, 1363 (10th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted). The burden is on the plaintiff to show she is\n\nsimilarly situated to the employee with whom she is comparing herself. Cone v.\n\nLongmont United Hosp. Ass’n, 14 F.3d 526, 532 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n      The district court concluded Ms. Block failed to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination because she failed to prove she occupied a substantially\n\nsimilar position to Mr. Dennis. Aplt. Br., Att. A. at 26. Upon a thorough review\n\nof the evidence, we agree. Ms. Block and Mr. Dennis were not similarly situated.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fSee Aramburu v. Boeing Co., 112 F.3d 1398, 1404 (10th Cir. 1997). 1 Ms. Block\n\nand Mr. Dennis each had very different backgrounds and brought different levels\n\nof experience and knowledge to their positions. See id. In her position prior to\n\nthe promotion, Ms. Block’s time was split between both the marketing and sales\n\ndepartment, while Mr. Dennis only worked in sales under the direction of Mr.\n\nStemple. After the promotions, Ms. Block and Mr. Dennis would have worked\n\nfor different departments, with different supervisors and independent budgets.\n\nSee id. Most importantly, the positions entailed different types of work. Ms.\n\nBlock’s responsibilities were more administrative and customer service based,\n\nwhile Mr. Dennis’s position involved outside sales and required more technical\n\n\n\n      1\n       Ms. Block argues she suffered wage discrimination from November 1998\nto January 2001, based on the salary Mr. Dennis was to receive beginning\nFebruary 5. Aplt. Reply Br. at 11. Ms. Block therefore asserts the correct\ncomparison is between Mr. Dennis’s new position as administrative assistant to\nsales and stores and her former position when she worked as an administrative\nassistant to both sales and marketing. Ms. Block argues for damages based on the\napproximately two years prior to January 2001 in which she alleges pay\ndiscrimination. Ms. Block conceded at oral argument, however, that in her EEOC\ncharge she only alleged pay discrimination based on Mr. Dennis’s compensation\nas compared with the compensation she was to receive in her new position.\n       Kwal argues Ms. Block’s claim of discrimination is limited to alleged\ndiscrimination based on the respective January 2001 offers. Aplee. Br. at 2. Thus\nKwal asserts we have no jurisdiction to adjudicate any claims related to\ncompensation prior to January 2001. Id. at 1. We need not resolve this issue.\nWhether we compare Mr. Dennis’s new position with Ms. Block’s prior position\nor her position after the restructuring, our conclusion is the same. The jobs are\nnot similar, and therefore Ms. Block fails to establish a prima facie case of\nemployment discrimination.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fpaint knowledge.\n\n       Ms. Block attempts to argue similarity based on the position titles, her\n\nsales responsibilities with regard to the business to business and realtor programs,\n\na few common responsibilities such as working with special quotes and the Visual\n\nPainter program, and the fact Mr. Dennis was to take over responsibility for\n\nseveral of her former duties. 2 These arguments only go so far when the actual job\n\nfunctions are considered. Similar titles alone do not satisfy the requirement of\n\nsimilarity between jobs. See Doan v. Seagate Tech., Inc., 82 F.3d 974, 979 (10th\n\nCir. 1996). In addition, the evidence is undisputed that the business to business\n\naccounts are very different than the outside sales contracts. Aplt. Br. at 212, 215.\n\nPointing to a few commonalities such as working with a particular program (e.g.\n\nVisual Painter) also does not transform an otherwise dissimilar job into a similar\n\none. Finally, the fact Mr. Dennis was to assume Ms. Block’s sales\n\nresponsibilities does not make his position similar to hers. There is no evidence\n\nthat his new position would be limited to a mere subset of her duties. There is\n\nsubstantial evidence, however, that he had additional responsibilities that were\n\ndifferent than Ms. Block’s, including continuing outside sales, addressing\n\n\n      2\n       To the extent Ms. Block argues evidence of Mr. Dennis’s duties during the\nperiod directly following her resignation illustrates the similarity between the\npositions, she ignores the evidence that some short term restructuring was\nrequired to cover for her position following her resignation. Aplt. App. at 174,\n189.\n\n                                        -8-\n\ftechnical questions, and taking on various responsibilities from Mr. Stemple.\n\nAplt. App. at 163, 164, 196. As much as Ms. Block attempts to argue otherwise,\n\nno reasonable trier of fact could conclude Ms. Block and Mr. Dennis were\n\nsimilarly situated.\n\n      Ms. Block argues other evidence supports the conclusion she was treated\n\nless favorably based on her sex. She points to evidence that Mr. Roughton, her\n\nsupervisor, threatened to quit on a few occasions and was given time off work to\n\nthink about it by Mr. Tunno. Aplt. Br. at 29. There is no evidence that Mr.\n\nRoughton tendered a final written resignation, as did Ms. Block, however, and the\n\nsituations are not comparable. See Aplt. App. at 262. We agree with the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Ms. Block failed to establish a prima facie case of pay\n\ndiscrimination. 3\n\n\n      3\n        Neither the district court in its order nor the parties in their briefs before\nthis court focus on the second prong of the prima facie case, which requires the\nplaintiff to show that her comparator was paid at a higher rate. Sprague, 129 F.3d\nat 1363. We note that Ms. Block fails to establish this element of the prima facie\ncase as well. Mr. Dennis was to be compensated at a flat salary of $48,000 in his\nnew position, and was expected to continue to work his usual 60-65 hours per\nweek. Ms. Block received $15.25 per hour in her position as of January 2001, or\n$31,720 per year. In 2000 she worked 900 hours of overtime, or approximately\n58 hours per week. Based on this amount of overtime, her yearly compensation\nwas approximately $52,308. Ms. Block was to receive $17.25 per hour after her\npromotion, or $35,880 based on a 40 hour work week, and she would still be\neligible for overtime. Aplt. App. at 100-01. Although she expected some\ndecrease in the number of hours of overtime she would be working, the position\nwas still expected to include overtime. Id. at 238, 242. If she had continued at\nthe pace of overtime she worked in 2000, her yearly salary would have been\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      In addition to her pay discrimination claim, Ms. Block also asserts a\n\nretaliation claim under Title VII. Retaliation is a separate discriminatory offense\n\nunder Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). To establish a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, Ms. Block must show that “(1) she engaged in protected activity under\n\nTitle VII or the ADEA; (2) she subsequently suffered an adverse employment\n\naction; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and\n\nthe adverse employment action.” Wells v. Colo. Dept. of Transp., 325 F.3d 1205,\n\n1212 (10th Cir. 2003). Ms. Block asserts that she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action because she was constructively discharged in retaliation for\n\nlodging a complaint regarding her unequal pay. She appeals the district court’s\n\ndetermination that she was not constructively discharged.\n\n      “An employee who is not formally discharged from employment may still\n\nbe constructively discharged if the employee was forced to quit due to [gender]-\n\nbased, intolerable working conditions.” Bolden v. PRC, Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 552\n\n(10th Cir. 1995). Thus constructive discharge qualifies as an adverse employment\n\naction under Title VII. Constructive discharge exists under Title VII when “‘a\n\nreasonable person would view the working conditions as intolerable,’” Hirschfeld\n\nv. N.M. Corr. Dep’t, 916 F.2d 572, 580 (10 th Cir. 1990) (quoting Derr v. Gulf Oil\n\n\n\n\napproximately $59,168. In addition, Ms. Block expected to receive an additional\nraise in April 2001. Id. at 100.\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fCorp., 796 F.2d 340, 343 (10th Cir. 1986)), and “the employer by its illegal\n\ndiscriminatory acts has made working conditions so difficult that a reasonable\n\nperson in the employee’s position would feel compelled to resign,” Derr, 796\n\nF.2d at 344.\n\n      Ms. Block argues she was constructively discharged because she was\n\nsubject to intolerable working conditions and discriminatory actions such that she\n\nwas compelled to resign. She argues comments, jokes, and inappropriate\n\nlanguage in the workplace constituted aggravating factors that made staying on\n\nthe job intolerable. See Aplt. Br. at 29. Ms. Block attempts to combine this\n\nalleged conduct with the events of January 30 through February 1 to bolster her\n\nargument that her working conditions were intolerable. See Bennett v. Quark,\n\nInc., 258 F.3d 1220, 1229 (10th Cir. 2001) (requiring aggravating factors in\n\naddition to a discriminatory action such as failure to promote in order to show the\n\njob was intolerable). However, no reasonable jury could conclude based on the\n\nevidence presented that Kwal subjected Ms. Block to working conditions so\n\nintolerable that she was forced to resign.\n\n      There is no evidence that Ms. Block made a complaint about the language\n\nor comments to a supervisor or manager while employed at Kwal. Aplt. App. at\n\n117. Ms. Block did not refer in her letter of resignation to such conduct or to a\n\nhostile work environment generally; rather, she focused solely on her concerns\n\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\fregarding her new position. Aplt. App. at 98-99. In fact, in her EEOC complaint,\n\nMs. Block stated “I would like to state that it has been really hard for me to leave\n\nKwal-Howells. I enjoyed the people that I worked for.” Id. at 107. It was in the\n\nweek after her discovery that Ms. Block became angry and upset with her\n\nsituation at Kwal. Id. at 103. No reasonable jury could conclude the comments,\n\nlanguage, and jokes Ms. Block refers to constitute aggravating factors that made\n\nstaying in her position intolerable. See Bennett, 258 F.3d at 1230 (finding\n\nstatements inappropriate but insufficient to show the existence of pervasive bias\n\nin the workplace).\n\n      It is clear Ms. Block was unhappy during her final days at Kwal as a result\n\nof what she perceived to be unequal treatment. See Aplt. Br. at 23-28. However,\n\n“not every unhappy employee has an actionable claim of constructive discharge\n\npursuant to Title VII.” Bolden, 43 F.3d at 552; see also Heno v. Sprint/United\n\nMgmt. Co., 208 F.3d 847, 858 (10th Cir. 2000); Sanchez v. Denver Pub. Sch., 164\n\nF.3d 527, 534 (10th Cir. 1998). Ms. Block must allege “facts sufficient to\n\ndemonstrate under an objective test that a reasonable person would have viewed\n\nher working conditions as intolerable.” Jeffries v. Kansas Dep’t of Soc. and\n\nRehab. Servs., 147 F.3d 1220, 1233 (10th Cir. 1998). She must show she had\n\n“‘no other choice but to quit.’” Yearous v. Niobrara Cty. Mem’l Hosp., 128 F.3d\n\n1351, 1356 (10th Cir. 1997) (quoting Woodward v. City of Worland, 977 F.2d\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\f1392, 1401 (10th Cir. 1992)).\n\n      Although we do not foreclose the possibility of intolerable working\n\nconditions arising over the span of a few days, in this case the evidence does not\n\nsupport this conclusion. Ms. Block made a complaint with regard to the\n\ndifference in pay, had an argument with her supervisor the next day that became a\n\n“little volatile,” Aplt. App. at 105, and immediately tendered her resignation. “If\n\nan employee resigns of her own free will, even as a result of the employer’s\n\nactions, that employee will not be held to have been constructively discharged.”\n\nJeffries, 147 F.3d at 1233. Rather than supporting that her resignation was\n\ncompelled, the evidence supports the conclusion Ms. Block resigned of her own\n\nfree will. The conditions at Ms. Block’s workplace were not “such that a\n\nreasonable employee would have felt they had no choice but to quit,” Heno, 208\n\nF.3d at 858, and therefore the district court properly determined Ms. Block was\n\nnot constructively discharged.\n\n      Ms. Block asserts that even if we find she was not constructively\n\ndischarged, she is still entitled to recover damages under Title VII up until her\n\nresignation date, plus attorney’s fees, for the alleged pay discrimination she\n\nexperienced for approximately two years prior to January 2001. This argument\n\nfails. Ms. Block cites cases regarding the calculation of damages when a plaintiff\n\nestablishes discrimination by his or her former employer, but nevertheless quits\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\frather than suffering constructive discharge. See Derr, 796 F.2d at 342; Swanson\n\nv. Colorado Dept. of Health, 773 F. Supp. 255, 257 (D. Colo. 1991). These cases\n\nare inapplicable because Ms. Block has not established discrimination. Ms. Block\n\nhas failed to present sufficient evidence of discrimination, and therefore the\n\ndistrict court properly awarded Kwal summary judgment.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n                                                 Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                                 Paul J.

After a thorough analysis, the district court granted Kwal’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment and dismissed Ms. Block’s claims. Ms. Block appeals the\n\ndismissal of her Title VII claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\n\nand we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                    Background\n\n      The district court’s order contains a detailed recitation of the relevant facts.\n\nWe therefore only summarize them briefly for our discussion. Ms. Block worked\n\nas an employee at Kwal, a Colorado paint manufacturer and distributor, from\n\nDecember 1996 to January 2001. Prior to working at Kwal, Ms. Block primarily\n\nworked in an administrative capacity and had no prior experience in the paint\n\nindustry. She was initially hired to assist both the marketing and sales\n\norganizations in administrative matters. Ms. Block’s initial salary was $11 per\n\nhour, although, as a result of periodic raises, she was making $15.25 per hour in\n\nJanuary 2001, or $31,720 per year based on a forty hour work week. Aplt. App.\n\nat 38, 298. Ms. Block often worked overtime–900 hours in 2000–and was\n\ncompensated at a rate of time and a half for those hours over forty in a given\n\nworkweek. Id. at 140, 241-42.\n\n      Mike Dennis, who Ms. Block argues was paid more for similar work, was\n\nhired by Kwal in 1995 and held various sales positions, including Salesman,\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fAssistant Manager, Sales Representative, Sales Manager, and Store Manager. Mr.\n\nDennis had 31 prior years of experience in the paint industry when he was hired at\n\nKwal. Mr. Dennis also received various pay raises, and as of February 2001, he\n\nearned $48,000 per year. Id. at 39, 299. As a salaried employee, Mr. Dennis did\n\nnot receive overtime, although he worked on average sixty to sixty-five hours per\n\nweek. Id. at 184.\n\n      From 1998 until January 2001, Ms. Block was the Administrative Assistant\n\nfor both the sales and marketing departments. In this capacity, her duties\n\nincluded contact with customers regarding complaints and requests, processing\n\nmail, developing various programs, and coordinating special events. In this\n\nposition, Ms. Block reported to Thomas Stemple, the Vice President of Sales, and\n\nBryan Roughton, the Vice President of Business Development. Because Ms.\n\nBlock expressed an interest in focusing solely on marketing, the decision was\n\nmade to shift Ms. Block’s sales duties to someone in the sales department so she\n\ncould focus exclusively on marketing. As a result, Mr. Stemple interviewed Mr.\n\nDennis for the administrative assistant for sales/stores position. In this position,\n\nMr. Dennis was to continue to have a sales territory, take over some of the\n\nresponsibilities Ms. Block had been covering for the sales department, and\n\nassume some of Mr. Stemple’s responsibilities as well. Mr. Stemple offered the\n\nposition to Mr. Dennis in mid-January 2001, with the change in status to be\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\feffective February 5, and Mr. Dennis accepted.\n\n      On January 16, 2001, Mr. Roughton informed Ms. Block that she would be\n\nreceiving a promotion and that she would be working exclusively in the marketing\n\ndepartment. Ms. Block was to be paid an additional $2 per hour, making her total\n\nannual compensation $35,880 exclusive of overtime, with the potential for an\n\nadditional raise in April 2001 after she took on some additional duties. On\n\nJanuary 26, while in Mr. Stemple’s office, Ms. Block saw a “Change of Status”\n\nreport on his desk that indicated Mr. Dennis’s change in position and proposed\n\ncompensation of $48,000. As a result of this discovery, on January 30, 2001, Ms.\n\nBlock approached Kwal’s Human Resource Director, Sandy Long, and\n\ncomplained about the differences in salaries.\n\n      The next morning, January 31, Ms. Block spoke to Mr. Roughton and\n\ninformed him she would not stay at Kwal unless she also received a salary of\n\n$48,000. After Mr. Roughton informed her he was unable to pay her more than\n\nher previously discussed salary due to budgetary restraints, Ms. Block went to her\n\ndesk and drafted a resignation letter. She gave the letter to Ms. Long and Mr.\n\nRoughton at approximately 8:10 a.m. Aplt. App. at 371. She refused to speak\n\nwith Ms. Long, cleared her desk, and left the office.\n\n      On February 1, Ms. Block met with Ms. Long and Miles Tunno, Kwal’s\n\npresident. Mr. Tunno informed Ms. Block that he would accept her resignation.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fShe refused to update Mr. Roughton on the status of her work, and she left the\n\nmeeting. After filing a complaint with the EEOC, Ms. Block filed this action\n\nagainst Kwal, alleging various claims under Title VII and the EPA.\n\n      Ms. Block asserts the district court erred in (1) holding she failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of sex-based pay discrimination under Title VII, (2)\n\nholding she was not constructively discharged, and (3) failing to hold a trial on\n\nthe issues of damages and attorney’s fees under Title VII.\n\n\n\n                                     Discussion\n\n      We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\n“applying the same standards used by the district court.” Byers v.

Aplt. Br., Att. A. at 26. Upon a thorough review\n\nof the evidence, we agree. Ms. Block and Mr. Dennis were not similarly situated.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fSee Aramburu v.

See id. In her position prior to\n\nthe promotion, Ms. Block’s time was split between both the marketing and sales\n\ndepartment, while Mr. Dennis only worked in sales under the direction of Mr.\n\nStemple. After the promotions, Ms. Block and Mr. Dennis would have worked\n\nfor different departments, with different supervisors and independent budgets.\n\nSee id. Most importantly, the positions entailed different types of work. Ms.\n\nBlock’s responsibilities were more administrative and customer service based,\n\nwhile Mr. Dennis’s position involved outside sales and required more technical\n\n\n\n      1\n       Ms. Block argues she suffered wage discrimination from November 1998\nto January 2001, based on the salary Mr. Dennis was to receive beginning\nFebruary 5. Aplt. Reply Br. at 11. Ms. Block therefore asserts the correct\ncomparison is between Mr. Dennis’s new position as administrative assistant to\nsales and stores and her former position when she worked as an administrative\nassistant to both sales and marketing. Ms. Block argues for damages based on the\napproximately two years prior to January 2001 in which she alleges pay\ndiscrimination. Ms. Block conceded at oral argument, however, that in her EEOC\ncharge she only alleged pay discrimination based on Mr. Dennis’s compensation\nas compared with the compensation she was to receive in her new position.\n       Kwal argues Ms. Block’s claim of discrimination is limited to alleged\ndiscrimination based on the respective January 2001 offers. Aplee. Br. at 2. Thus\nKwal asserts we have no jurisdiction to adjudicate any claims related to\ncompensation prior to January 2001. Id. at 1. We need not resolve this issue.\nWhether we compare Mr. Dennis’s new position with Ms. Block’s prior position\nor her position after the restructuring, our conclusion is the same. The jobs are\nnot similar, and therefore Ms. Block fails to establish a prima facie case of\nemployment discrimination.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fpaint knowledge.\n\n       Ms. Block attempts to argue similarity based on the position titles, her\n\nsales responsibilities with regard to the business to business and realtor programs,\n\na few common responsibilities such as working with special quotes and the Visual\n\nPainter program, and the fact Mr. Dennis was to take over responsibility for\n\nseveral of her former duties. 2 These arguments only go so far when the actual job\n\nfunctions are considered. Similar titles alone do not satisfy the requirement of\n\nsimilarity between jobs. See Doan v. Seagate Tech., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153353\"><a href=\"/opinion/153353/doan-v-seagate-technology/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 979 (10th\n\nCir. 1996). In addition, the evidence is undisputed that the business to business\n\naccounts are very different than the outside sales contracts. Aplt. Br. at 212, 215.\n\nPointing to a few commonalities such as working with a particular program (e.g.\n\nVisual Painter) also does not transform an otherwise dissimilar job into a similar\n\none. Finally, the fact Mr. Dennis was to assume Ms. Block’s sales\n\nresponsibilities does not make his position similar to hers. There is no evidence\n\nthat his new position would be limited to a mere subset of her duties. There is\n\nsubstantial evidence, however, that he had additional responsibilities that were\n\ndifferent than Ms. Block’s, including continuing outside sales, addressing\n\n\n      2\n       To the extent Ms. Block argues evidence of Mr. Dennis’s duties during the\nperiod directly following her resignation illustrates the similarity between the\npositions, she ignores the evidence that some short term restructuring was\nrequired to cover for her position following her resignation. Aplt. App. at 174,\n189.\n\n                                        -8-\n\ftechnical questions, and taking on various responsibilities from Mr. Stemple.\n\nAplt. App. at 163, 164, 196. As much as Ms. Block attempts to argue otherwise,\n\nno reasonable trier of fact could conclude Ms. Block and Mr. Dennis were\n\nsimilarly situated.\n\n      Ms. Block argues other evidence supports the conclusion she was treated\n\nless favorably based on her sex. She points to evidence that Mr. Roughton, her\n\nsupervisor, threatened to quit on a few occasions and was given time off work to\n\nthink about it by Mr. Tunno. Aplt. Br. at 29. There is no evidence that Mr.\n\nRoughton tendered a final written resignation, as did Ms. Block, however, and the\n\nsituations are not comparable. See Aplt. App. at 262. We agree with the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Ms. Block failed to establish a prima facie case of pay\n\ndiscrimination. 3\n\n\n      3\n        Neither the district court in its order nor the parties in their briefs before\nthis court focus on the second prong of the prima facie case, which requires the\nplaintiff to show that her comparator was paid at a higher rate. Sprague, 129 F.3d\nat 1363. We note that Ms. Block fails to establish this element of the prima facie\ncase as well. Mr. Dennis was to be compensated at a flat salary of $48,000 in his\nnew position, and was expected to continue to work his usual 60-65 hours per\nweek. Ms. Block received $15.25 per hour in her position as of January 2001, or\n$31,720 per year. In 2000 she worked 900 hours of overtime, or approximately\n58 hours per week. Based on this amount of overtime, her yearly compensation\nwas approximately $52,308. Ms. Block was to receive $17.25 per hour after her\npromotion, or $35,880 based on a 40 hour work week, and she would still be\neligible for overtime. Aplt. App. at 100-01. Although she expected some\ndecrease in the number of hours of overtime she would be working, the position\nwas still expected to include overtime. Id. at 238, 242. If she had continued at\nthe pace of overtime she worked in 2000, her yearly salary would have been\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      In addition to her pay discrimination claim, Ms. Block also asserts a\n\nretaliation claim under Title VII. Retaliation is a separate discriminatory offense\n\nunder Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). To establish a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, Ms. Block must show that “(1) she engaged in protected activity under\n\nTitle VII or the ADEA; (2) she subsequently suffered an adverse employment\n\naction; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and\n\nthe adverse employment action.” Wells v.

Ms. Block asserts that she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action because she was constructively discharged in retaliation for\n\nlodging a complaint regarding her unequal pay. She appeals the district court’s\n\ndetermination that she was not constructively discharged.\n\n      “An employee who is not formally discharged from employment may still\n\nbe constructively discharged if the employee was forced to quit due to [gender]-\n\nbased, intolerable working conditions.” Bolden v.

Ms. Block attempts to combine this\n\nalleged conduct with the events of January 30 through February 1 to bolster her\n\nargument that her working conditions were intolerable. See Bennett v.

However, no reasonable jury could conclude based on the\n\nevidence presented that Kwal subjected Ms. Block to working conditions so\n\nintolerable that she was forced to resign.\n\n      There is no evidence that Ms. Block made a complaint about the language\n\nor comments to a supervisor or manager while employed at Kwal. Aplt. App. at\n\n117. Ms. Block did not refer in her letter of resignation to such conduct or to a\n\nhostile work environment generally; rather, she focused solely on her concerns\n\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\fregarding her new position. Aplt. App. at 98-99. In fact, in her EEOC complaint,\n\nMs. Block stated “I would like to state that it has been really hard for me to leave\n\nKwal-Howells. I enjoyed the people that I worked for.” Id. at 107. It was in the\n\nweek after her discovery that Ms. Block became angry and upset with her\n\nsituation at Kwal. Id. at 103. No reasonable jury could conclude the comments,\n\nlanguage, and jokes Ms. Block refers to constitute aggravating factors that made\n\nstaying in her position intolerable. See Bennett, 258 F.3d at 1230 (finding\n\nstatements inappropriate but insufficient to show the existence of pervasive bias\n\nin the workplace).\n\n      It is clear Ms. Block was unhappy during her final days at Kwal as a result\n\nof what she perceived to be unequal treatment. See Aplt. Br. at 23-28. However,\n\n“not every unhappy employee has an actionable claim of constructive discharge\n\npursuant to Title VII.” Bolden, 43 F.3d at 552; see also Heno v.

City of Worland, 977 F.2d\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\f1392, 1401 (10th Cir. 1992)).\n\n      Although we do not foreclose the possibility of intolerable working\n\nconditions arising over the span of a few days, in this case the evidence does not\n\nsupport this conclusion. Ms. Block made a complaint with regard to the\n\ndifference in pay, had an argument with her supervisor the next day that became a\n\n“little volatile,” Aplt. App. at 105, and immediately tendered her resignation. “If\n\nan employee resigns of her own free will, even as a result of the employer’s\n\nactions, that employee will not be held to have been constructively discharged.”\n\nJeffries, 147 F.3d at 1233. Rather than supporting that her resignation was\n\ncompelled, the evidence supports the conclusion Ms. Block resigned of her own\n\nfree will. The conditions at Ms. Block’s workplace were not “such that a\n\nreasonable employee would have felt they had no choice but to quit,” Heno, 208\n\nF.3d at 858, and therefore the district court properly determined Ms. Block was\n\nnot constructively discharged.\n\n      Ms. Block asserts that even if we find she was not constructively\n\ndischarged, she is still entitled to recover damages under Title VII up until her\n\nresignation date, plus attorney’s fees, for the alleged pay discrimination she\n\nexperienced for approximately two years prior to January 2001. This argument\n\nfails. Ms. Block cites cases regarding the calculation of damages when a plaintiff\n\nestablishes discrimination by his or her former employer, but nevertheless quits\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\frather than suffering constructive discharge.
