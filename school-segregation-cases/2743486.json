Boyd, Chief Justice (Ret.), Seventh Court of Appeals, sitting by\nassignment.\n\fof Appeals, and $5,000 for an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. By three points of\n\nerror, Busteed contends the trial court erred in 1) allowing COCISD’s attorney to testify that\n\nit was necessary to hire him because no one testified that COCISD agreed to pay\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and there was no suit on a contract, 2) allowing\n\nthe testimony of COCISD’s attorney because there were no records produced for cross-\n\nexamination though they were requested, and 3) awarding $33,531 for the trial of a simple\n\noverpayment claim when the case was clearly over massaged for such a collection effort.\n\nBased upon the rationale expressed herein, we affirm.\n\n\n       Our factual review will be limited to the evidence necessary to complete our\n\nanalysis of the presented points directed to the award of attorney’s fees because Busteed\n\ndoes not challenge the denial of any recovery on her counterclaims or that COCISD\n\nrecover $8,999.93 for its overpayment to her, plus interest, and does not question the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence. By written contract for the school year 1993-1994, Busteed\n\nwas employed by COCISD for a term of one year. The contract did not specify the amount\n\nof Busteed’s salary; however, paragraph 2 of the contract provided:\n\n\n       The Board shall pay the Employee an annual salary according to the salary\n       schedule to be adopted by the Board before the performance of this contract\n       begins, but in no event less than the state minimum salary. The Employee’s\n       salary includes consideration for any additional duties, responsibilities, and\n       tasks except as provided in the District supplemental duty schedule.\n\n\nParagraph 1 of the contract provided in part:\n\n\n                                              2\n\f      The Employee agrees to accept payment of the annual salary in twelve\n      equal monthly installments, payable on the same day of each month during\n      the term of the contract . . . without any right to prepayment or lump-sum\n      settlement. . . .\n\n\nWhen the school board adopted the salary schedule for the subject school year, Busteed’s\n\nmonthly salary was fixed at $2,824.10; however, by inadvertence and mistake, COCISD\n\nissued Busteed nine checks in the amount of $3,824.10 each, resulting in an overpayment\n\nof $8,999.93.\n\n\n      When efforts to resolve the mistaken payments were unsuccessful, COCISD filed\n\nsuit to recover the overpayment and also sought to recover reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\nIn response, Busteed alleged ratification of the overpayment, laches, negligence, and\n\nestoppel. Busteed did not contend by special exception or otherwise that attorney’s fees\n\nwere not recoverable. Also, Busteed asserted a counterclaim under the Texas Debt\n\nCollection Practices Act, now codified at sections 392.001 through 392.404 of the Texas\n\nFinance Code. Following reversal of a summary judgment in favor of COCISD, upon jury\n\ntrial, the trial court instructed a verdict that Busteed take nothing on her counterclaim.\n\nAfter receiving jury findings that Busteed had not retained the overpayment in good faith\n\nand that she had not changed her position to her detriment in reliance thereon, the trial\n\ncourt then received evidence on the question of attorney’s fees and the jury found $33,531\n\nto be a “reasonable fee for the necessary services” of COCISD’s attorney through the trial\n\ncourt, and $5,000 for an appeal to the Court of Appeals, and $5,000 for an appeal to the\n\n\n                                            3\n\fTexas Supreme Court. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment that COCISD\n\nrecover $8,9999.93, plus interest, and attorney’s fees as found by the jury.\n\n\n       Considering Busteed’s points in logical rather than sequential order, we first\n\nconsider her third point by which she contends the trial court erred in awarding $33,531\n\nfor the trial of a simple overpayment claim of $8,999.93 when the case was clearly over\n\nmassaged for such a collection effort. We disagree. To preserve a complaint of factual\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict, a point of error must first be raised\n\nby motion for new trial. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 324(b)(2). A legal insufficiency point must be\n\nraised by (1) a motion for instructed verdict, (2) a motion for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, (3) an objection to the submission of the issue to the jury, (4) a motion to disregard\n\nthe jury’s answer to a vital fact issue, or (5) a motion for new trial. See Cecil v. Smith, 804\n\nS.W.2d 509, 510-11 (Tex. 1991).1 Accordingly, because Busteed did not properly present\n\nher challenge to the amount of the attorney’s fees below, her appellate complaint is not\n\npreserved for review. Point of error three is overruled.\n\n\n       By her first point, Busteed contends the trial court erred in admitting the testimony\n\nof the attorney for COCISD because there was no evidence that it was necessary that an\n\nattorney be engaged and there was no suit on a contract. Then, by her second point she\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        See also W. Wendell Hall, Standards of Review in Texas, Challenges to the\nSufficiency of the Evidence in Jury Trials, 29 St. Mary’s Law Rev. 476-94 (1998).\n\n                                              4\n\fcontends the admission of the attorney’s testimony was error because no records were\n\npresented for purposes of cross-examination. We disagree.\n\n\n       Before we commence our analysis, although multifarious, we first consider\n\nBusteed’s contention that there was no suit on a contract. By its pleadings, COCISD\n\nalleged a written contract that provided for payment of Busteed’s salary in twelve equal\n\nmonthly installments. In addition, the written contract was attached as an exhibit and\n\nincorporated into the pleadings. Notwithstanding these allegations, Busteed did not\n\nspecially except to the allegation seeking recovery for attorney’s fees as required by Rules\n\n90 and 91 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the contention presents\n\nnothing for review. Roark v. Allen, 633 S.W.2d 804, 809-10 (Tex. 1982).\n\n\n       Next, we consider Busteed’s challenge to the testimony of COCISD’s attorney that\n\n1) there was no testimony that his services were required and no evidence that COCISD\n\nagreed to pay a reasonable fee, and 2) no records were available to be used in cross-\n\nexamination. We consider the points to be a challenge that proper predicates were not\n\nmade to support the admission of the attorney’s testimony.\n\n\n       The admission and exclusion of evidence is committed to the trial court’s sound\n\ndiscretion. City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753-54 (Tex. 1995). A trial\n\ncourt abuses its discretion when it acts without regard to any guiding rules or principles.\n\nDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985). To obtain\n\n\n                                             5\n\freversal, Busteed must show 1) the trial court did in fact commit error, and 2) the error was\n\nreasonably calculated to cause and probably did cause rendition of an improper judgment.\n\nTex. R. App. P. 44.1(a)(1); Gee v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 765 S.W.2d 394, 396 (Tex.\n\n1989).\n\n\n         We commence our analysis by considering whether recovery of attorney’s fees\n\nrequires evidence that the a) services of an attorney were necessary, b) that the party\n\nmust agree to pay a reasonable fee, and c) that records must be available for cross-\n\nexamination. Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Annotated\n\nauthorizes a prevailing party in a lawsuit to recover reasonable attorney’s fees in eight\n\ninstances including suit on “an oral or written contract.” Also, section 38.002 sets out the\n\nprocedure for recovery of attorney’s fees. However, section 38.001 does not require\n\nevidence that attorney’s fees were necessary or that the client agreed to pay them. See\n\nMurrco Agency, Inc. v. Ryan, 800 S.W.2d 600, 606 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1990, no writ)\n\n(holding that unlike the provisions of Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(d), which\n\nrequires that attorney’s fees must be necessary in a proceeding under the Deceptive\n\nTrade Practice Act, section 38.001 only requires that the amount of attorney’s fees be\n\nreasonable without reference to the necessity thereof); see also Prairie Valley Ind. School\n\nDist. v. Sawyer, 665 S.W.2d 606, 611 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.)\n\n(holding that former article 2226 of Texas Revised Civil Statutes Annotated did not require\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fevidence that attorney’s fees were necessary apart from testimony as to their\n\nreasonableness).\n\n\n      Busteed’s contention regarding production of records does not implicate the rule\n\nthat when applicable, a party seeking attorney’s fees must segregate the evidence\n\nregarding those fees. See Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10-11\n\n(Tex.1991). Moreover, neither section 38.001 nor section 38.002 requires that records\n\nsupporting the opinion as to reasonable fees be produced for purposes of cross-\n\nexamination. We have not overlooked Busteed’s contention that Black Lake Pipe Line Co.\n\nv. Union Const. Co., 538 S.W.2d 80 (Tex. 1976) requires that records be produced for\n\npurposes of cross-examination; however, that case is not controlling because the witness\n\ndid not refer to records or summaries to refresh his recollection and summaries of records\n\nwere not offered into evidence. Points one and two are overruled.\n\n\n      Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                         Don H.

Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Annotated\n\nauthorizes a prevailing party in a lawsuit to recover reasonable attorney’s fees in eight\n\ninstances including suit on “an oral or written contract.” Also, section 38.002 sets out the\n\nprocedure for recovery of attorney’s fees. However, section 38.001 does not require\n\nevidence that attorney’s fees were necessary or that the client agreed to pay them. See\n\nMurrco Agency, Inc. v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2383584\"><a href=\"/opinion/2383584/murrco-agency-inc-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1990, no writ)\n\n(holding that unlike the provisions of Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.50(d), which\n\nrequires that attorney’s fees must be necessary in a proceeding under the Deceptive\n\nTrade Practice Act, section 38.001 only requires that the amount of attorney’s fees be\n\nreasonable without reference to the necessity thereof); see also Prairie Valley Ind.

Moreover, neither section 38.001 nor section 38.002 requires that records\n\nsupporting the opinion as to reasonable fees be produced for purposes of cross-\n\nexamination.
