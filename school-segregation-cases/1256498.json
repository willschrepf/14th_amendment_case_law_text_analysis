Esparza contends that\nthe evidence demonstrated that he is mentally retarded, rendering him ineligible\nfor the death penalty under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002). Relying on\nthe Sixth Amendment, Esparza asserts that he is entitled to a jury finding with\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR . R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR .\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 2 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nrespect to the issue of mental retardation. He also contends that his counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate his mental retardation\nand present evidence of his mental retardation at sentencing. Finding that\nEsparza has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\nright, we DENY a COA.\n      I.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n      A Bexar County, Texas grand jury returned an indictment charging\nEsparza with the capital murder of 7-year old Alyssa Vasquez while in the\ncourse of committing aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, and burglary. T EX.\nP ENAL C ODE § 19.03(a)(2).    A jury convicted Esparza as charged, and the\nsentence imposed was the death penalty. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\naffirmed Esparza’s conviction in an unpublished opinion. Esparza v. State, No.\n74,096 (Tex. Crim. App. June 4, 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1006 (2003).\nRepresented by counsel, Esparza applied for state habeas relief, and the trial\ncourt recommended denying relief.        Additionally, Esparza filed a separate\napplication for writ of habeas corpus pro se. With respect to the first application,\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the findings and conclusions of the trial\ncourt and denied the application. Ex parte Esparza, Nos. WR-66111-01, WR-\n66111-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Feb. 28, 2007). The Court of Criminal Appeals also\ndismissed the pro se application as an abuse of the writ. Esparza then filed a\nfederal petition for writ of habeas corpus, which the district court denied in a\nmemorandum opinion and order. Esparza v. Quarterman, No. 07-265 (W.D. Tex.\nMar. 24, 2010). The district court also denied a COA. Esparza now requests a\nCOA from this Court.\n      II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      Esparza filed his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus after\nthe effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).\nThe petition, therefore, is subject to AEDPA. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S.\n\n                                         2\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 3 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\n320, 336 (1997). Pursuant to the federal habeas statute, as amended by AEDPA,\nwe defer to a state court’s adjudication of a petitioner’s claims on the merits\nunless the state court’s decision was: (1) “contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States”; or (2) “resulted in a decision that was\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\npresented in the State court proceeding.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). A state court’s\ndecision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it reaches a legal\nconclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it\nreaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially\nindistinguishable facts. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404–08 (2000). A\nstate court’s decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law if it is “objectively unreasonable.” Id. at 409. Further,\npursuant to § 2254(e)(1), state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct,\nand the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness\nby clear and convincing evidence. See Valdez v. Cockrell, 274 F.3d 941, 947 (5th\nCir. 2001).\n      Additionally, under AEDPA, a petitioner must obtain a COA before he can\nappeal the district court’s denial of habeas relief. See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c); see\nalso Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 335–36 (2003) (“[U]ntil a COA has been\nissued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals\nfrom habeas petitioners.”). As the Supreme Court has explained:\n             The COA determination under § 2253(c) requires an overview\n      of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of\n      their merits. We look to the District Court’s application of AEDPA\n      to petitioner’s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution\n      was debatable among jurists of reason. This threshold inquiry does\n      not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced\n      in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 4 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nMiller-El, 537 U.S. at 336.\n      A COA will be granted only if the petitioner makes “a substantial showing\nof the denial of a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). “A petitioner\nsatisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree\nwith the district court’s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists\ncould conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to\nproceed further.” Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 327 (citation omitted). “The question is\nthe debatability of the underlying constitutional claim, not the resolution of that\ndebate.” Id. at 342. “Indeed, a claim can be debatable even though every jurist\nof reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received\nfull consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.”    Id. at 338.   Moreover,\n“[b]ecause the present case involves the death penalty, any doubts as to whether\na COA should issue must be resolved in [petitioner’s] favor.” Hernandez v.\nJohnson, 213 F.3d 243, 248 (5th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).\n      III.   ANALYSIS\n             A. ATKINS CLAIM\n      In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321 (2002), the Supreme Court held\nthat the Eighth Amendment prohibited the execution of mentally retarded\npersons. Esparza contends that he is mentally retarded, and thus is ineligible\nfor the death penalty. Subsequent to Atkins, Texas courts have followed the\ndefinition of “mental retardation” adopted by the American Association on\nMental Retardation and the nearly identical definition set forth in § 591.003(13)\nof the Texas Health & Safety Code. In re Salazar, 443 F.3d 430, 432 (5th Cir.\n2006). Pursuant to this test, a petitioner claiming mental retardation must\ndemonstrate that “he suffers from a disability characterized by ‘(1) significantly\nsubaverage general intellectual functioning,’ usually defined as an I.Q. of about\n70 or below; ‘(2) accompanied by related limitations in adaptive functioning; (3)\nthe onset of which occurs prior to the age of 18.’” Id. (quoting Ex parte Briseno,\n\n                                        4\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 5 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70009\n\n135 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nEsparza bore the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he\nis mentally retarded. Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 12. A determination of whether\na person is mentally retarded is a factual finding. Moore v. Quarterman, 533\nF.3d 338, 342 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc); Clark v. Quarterman, 457 F.3d 441, 444\n(5th Cir. 2006).\n      Esparza raised his claim of mental retardation during his state habeas\nproceedings, and the state court held an evidentiary hearing. During this\nhearing, several expert witnesses testified regarding Esparza’s I.Q. scores and\nadaptive functioning.    Also, his sister testified about his childhood, and\nEsparza’s prison and school records were admitted.\n                   1.   Lynda Tussay\n      Esparza called Lynda Tussay to testify. Tussay is a licensed professional\ncounselor and has a master’s degree in Human Development and Counseling.\nTussay interviewed Esparza and administered intelligence tests. She testified\nthat the range of mental retardation was a 70 I.Q. or lower. Esparza scored a\n71 (standard error of plus or minus 5 points) on the Raven’s Standard\nProgressive Matrices Test.    With respect to the Revised Minnesota Paper\nFormboard Test, Esparza scored a 73 (standard error of plus or minus 4 points).\nTussay explained that the above two scores were within the range of borderline\nintellectual functioning. On the achievement tests, Esparza was at the level of\nfirst grade math and below the level of first grade on this spelling test. On\nanother spelling test, he scored at the level of grade 6.3. Esparza’s vocabulary\nwas at a grade level of 6.2, and his reading comprehension was at a 4.7 grade\nlevel. Tussay also administered the Comprehensive Trail-Making Test, and\nEsparza scored better than 58 percent of the population. On that test, a score\nof under 40 percent would indicate mental retardation. With respect to the\nControlled Oral Word Association Test, Esparza scored 25.82, which is nearly\n\n                                       5\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 6 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70009\n\nfour full standard deviations below the mean, which is 48.43. Tussay testified\nthat the score indicates “a person who does not do well with any kind of form of\nwritten language.”\n      The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Test is a questionnaire for the\ncaregiver of the person being tested regarding the subject’s developmental\nhistory. Tussay explained that this test is the “essential measure, the one that\nmost psychologists use when using the adaptive behavior scales.”            She\nadministered the test to Esparza’s older sister, Esther Moncado, who was\nEsparza’s primary caregiver when he was a child. The mean score is 100, and\nEsparza’s score was below 20, which is the “lowest score” possible.\n      Tussay further testified that she “can usually tell when someone is trying\nto not do a good job. That wasn’t what he was trying to do.” In her opinion,\n“there was no deliberate sabotage on his part. He just did not understand. He\njust didn’t understand what I was trying to tell him.” In Tussay’s opinion,\nEsparza “meets all of the criteria for mental retardation.”\n      During the cross examination of Tussay, the prosecutor produced two of\nEsparza’s penitentiary packets, which included the Texas Department of\nCorrections Social and Criminal History page. The first packet provided that in\n1985 Esparza had an I.Q. score of 86. The second packet provided that in 1993\nEsparza had an I.Q. score of 88. After reviewing the packets, Tussay testified\nthat she could not “formulate an opinion based on” them because she did “not\nknow what they based their tests on.” The packets did not provide what specific\ntests were administered to Esparza. She also admitted that Esparza heard from\nhis lawyer that if he was mentally retarded, then the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Atkins would bar his execution.\n      Additionally, Tussay testified that during her interview of Esparza she\nnoticed that Esparza was “able to speak very well.” She discovered that his\nfamily had done migrant farm work and thus “he was not really ever very rooted\n\n                                       6\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 7 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nin any one school.” Esparza had been in special education classes and failed the\nninth grade three times before dropping out of high school. Tussay also stated\nthat Esparza told her that he failed the test for a GED but that the instructor\nissued a GED so that the instructor would be compensated.\n      Tussay also spoke with Esparza’s older sister who indicated that Esparza\nhad a “history of adaptive problems.” His sister had “difficulty in teaching him\nhow to tie his shoes, how to dress himself. It took longer and he was older before\nhe was able to attain those skills.”     Esparza did not “play like the other\nchildren.” For example, he did not develop “imaginary games.”\n                  2.     Recording of Jail Phone Calls\n      Esparza was moved from death row to Bexar County Jail during the time\nof the state writ evidentiary hearing. Sergeant Mark Gibson of the Bexar\nCounty Sheriff’s office submitted a recording of three phone calls made by\nEsparza during his stay at county jail. The recording was played at the writ\nhearing. Esparza identified himself at the beginning of each phone call. He\nhelped arrange a three-way conference call. He spoke to his attorney about the\nimpending court proceedings. He referred to the Supreme Court’s opinion in\nAtkins as the “2002 case.” Esparza boasted that his attorney was very good and\nhad gotten other inmates off death row. Esparza recounted to another person\nwhat his attorney had told him about the need to postpone the hearing. In one\nphone call, Esparza was advising another inmate’s family regarding that\ninmate’s civil suit against jail officials. Esparza also informed one person that\nhe could only have visitors on Mondays and Wednesdays. He complained that\nthe phone cards were unfairly charging too much money for the minutes\nprovided.\n                  3.     Dr. Kern\n      The State called Dr. Paul Kern, Ph.D., a psychologist at the University\nHealth System, Detention Health Care Services. Dr. Kern testified that Joanna\n\n                                        7\n\f     Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 8 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-70009\n\nW. Guerrero, a psychometrist with a master’s degree, administered two different\nintelligence tests and an achievement test to Esparza. Esparza scored in the\nmildly mentally retarded range on the intelligence tests, and his achievement\ntest score suggested very poor basic academic skills. Dr. Kern interviewed\nEsparza and interpreted the test scores.\n      Together Dr. Kern and Guerrero compiled a Summary of Intellectual\nTesting that was submitted to the state court. This report provided that, based\non Guerrero’s clinical impression, she estimated Esparza’s intelligence was\nwithin the low average range.1 The report provided that Esparza “displayed an\nextremely low level of motivation while responding to knowledge-based\nquestions, providing a large number of ‘I don’t know’ responses and displaying\na strong hesitance to venture guesses.”              His responses to knowledge-based\nquestions “were almost always incorrect.” Esparza responded that the current\nPresident of the United States was “Ford.” He reported that the United States\nflag colors are red, white, and green. Based on his responses, it was “strongly\nsuspected that he was intentionally performing below the level of his\ncapabilities.”    For example, “it was subsequently learned that although he\nprovided a blatantly incorrect definition of a thermometer during the mental\nstatus examination, he had previously provided a correct definition for the same\nterm during the psychological testing.” Esparza performed very poorly on a\nsimple memory task. The examiner noted that “it is rare . . . to see performance\nas poor as Mr. Esparza’s on the task even among young children with low\nintelligence and relatively severe Attention/Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.”\nAlso, during the time Esparza was not being asked knowledge-based questions,\nhis presentation “was suggestive of a much higher level of functioning, and a\nclinical estimate of his intelligence based on both his general presentation and\n\n\n\n      1\n          Guerrero did not testify at the hearing.\n\n                                              8\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 9 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nthe available historical information would place it somewhere within the Low\nAverage range.”\n       Dr. Kern testified that Esparza was able to read and understand his\nrights. Indeed, during one meeting, Esparza stopped the interview and asked\nfor counsel in order to obtain advice regarding whether to cooperate. Esparza\nretrieved his attorney’s business card from his cell and successfully contacted his\nattorney.   After consulting with counsel, Esparza decided to complete the\ninterview. Dr. Kern testified that Esparza’s presentation during the interview\ndid not appear to be that of a mentally retarded person. Dr. Kern concluded that\nEsparza’s motivation to do well on the I.Q. tests “was very low” and that the test\nresults were invalid or inaccurate. Esparza’s test score on the Vineland adaptive\nbehavior scale, which had been previously administered by Tussay, indicated\nthat he was profoundly retarded. Dr. Kern explained that a person of that level\nof intelligence or adaptive behavior “would be capable of doing almost nothing.\nA profoundly mentally retarded person, for example, would have no hope at all\nof ever learning language at all. They would have no hope at all of . . . ever\nhaving a job, probably. They would not be able to communicate at all.” Such a\nperson “would probably spend their whole life in an institution for the mentally\nretarded sitting in a corner oblivious to anything.” Dr. Kern explained that a\nperson can test below their intelligence level but not above it.       He further\ntestified that I.Q. scores generally do not change over a person’s life. Dr. Kern\nopined that Esparza’s scores of 88 and 86 in the penitentiary packets were\nconsistent with his clinical assessments regarding Esparza’s functioning.\nFurther, Esparza’s taped phone conversations suggest a higher level of\nfunctioning than the current test scores indicate. In Dr. Kern’s opinion, the\ncurrent test results provide “dramatic underestimates of Mr. Esparza’s\nknowledge and ability and are best viewed as invalid.”\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 10 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                      No. 10-70009\n\n      Dr. Kern also noted that during Esparza’s 2001 trial Dr. Arambula, a\nforensic psychiatrist, had testified that he did not have Esparza tested for\nmental retardation because he thought Esparza’s intelligence was “normal.” 2 Dr.\nKern is familiar with Dr. Arambula and relied in part upon his opinion in\nassessing Esparza. Finally, Dr. Kern testified that, based on the test results and\nhis clinical assessments, he did not think that Esparza was mentally retarded.\nInstead, as set forth in his report, Esparza’s “intellectual capabilities most likely\nfall somewhere within the Low Average range.”\n                     4.     Dr. Sparks\n      The State also called Dr. John Sparks, a psychiatrist and medical director\nof the Bexar County Detention Center. Previously, in his capacity as the medical\ndirector, Dr. Sparks had seen Esparza because of a treatment issue. Dr. Sparks\ntestified that Esparza “conveyed to me what he needed in a very clear and\nconcise way.”\n      At the request of the state court, Dr. Sparks interviewed Esparza and also\nreviewed the report issued by Dr. Kern. Dr. Sparks’ evaluation of Esparza\nprovides that he “is aware that it may lead to the death sentence if he is not\nretarded or may lead to life in prison if he is retarded.” Dr. Sparks concluded\nthat Esparza was not mentally retarded. Although Dr. Sparks acknowledged\nthat the current test scores were in the mildly mentally retarded range, his\nevaluation provided as follows:\n      [E]vidence from multiple sources suggest that the present test\n      results provide marked underestimates of his intellectual\n      capabilities. He displayed “pervasive evidence of poor test taking\n      attitude characterized by low motivation, poor attention and\n      concentration, and low task involvement and persistence.”[3 ] He\n\n\n      2\n          Dr. Arambula’s testimony will be more fully discussed infra in the context of\nEsparza’s claim of ineffective assistance.\n      3\n          Dr. Sparks’ evaluation was quoting from Dr. Kern’s report.\n\n                                            10\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 11 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-70009\n\n      made minimal effort in the testing although his abilities to\n      communicate and his ability to handle general living situations\n      seem well above the mentally retarded range. He had long term\n      gainful employment and knew how to drive and passed the drivers\n      test.\n\n      Dr. Sparks’ evaluation also found that Esparza’s functioning “was well\nabove the retardation level.” Dr. Sparks found that Esparza communicated very\nwell. Although Esparza does not write well, he “understands language better\nthan a retarded person can.” Esparza did not receive a good education and thus\n“has difficulty in writing communications.” However, his “adaptive ablity is\nexcellent.” Dr. Sparks found that the I.Q. scores of 86 and 88 contained in the\nprison records were consistent with his opinion that Esparza is not mentally\nretarded. Although Dr. Sparks initially estimated that Esparza had borderline\nintellectual functioning, after hearing Esparza’s taped phone conversations, he\nestimated that Esparza’s I.Q. would be “77 or 78, closer to 80, which would be\nthen low average.”\n                   5.    Esther Moncada\n      Esparza’s older sister, Esther Moncada, testified at the hearing that\nEsparza was a “slow learner” and had trouble tying his shoe laces. Their mother\nwas hospitalized after a mental breakdown when Esparza was about five or six\nyears old. Their father moved out of state, and the children were placed in an\norphanage until an uncle brought them back to San Antonio. Their father died\nwhen Esparza was ten or eleven years old. Moncada further testified that\nEsparza ate with his hands and had difficulty dressing himself. He dropped out\nof school after failing ninth grade three times and worked as a laborer. Esparza\ncould read and write “a little.”\n                   6.    State Court Finding of No Mental Retardation\n      The state trial court denied relief on this claim, concluding that Esparza\nhad failed to establish that he is mentally retarded. The Court of Criminal\n\n                                       11\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 12 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-70009\n\nAppeals expressly adopted this finding. Esparza challenges the state court’s\nfinding, contending that there was sufficient evidence to find that he was\nmentally retarded.\n      As previously set forth, Esparza has the burden of proving by a\npreponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded. Salazar, 443 F.3d\nat 432. The first prong of the test is whether he has significant subaverage\nintellectual function, usually defined as an I.Q. score of 70 or below. Briseno,\n135 S.W.3d at 7.\n      We first note that Judge Mary Roman of the 175th Judicial District Court\nof Bexar County presided over both Esparza’s trial and the state evidentiary\nhearing. As such, Judge Roman was able to observe Esparza testify in his own\ndefense during his capital trial.     During trial Esparza was asked to read a\nrequest that he had handwritten at the jail. From the witness stand, Esparza\nread aloud as follows: “I would like to ask you if I can be in segregation by\nmyself because I no longer trust nobody because there is a lot of people that don’t\nlike me because of a charge that I have, Capital case. I would like to be housed\nby myself for my own safety.” Moreover, we agree with the federal district court\nthat “[t]hroughout his trial testimony, [Esparza] furnished coherent, even\ncombative testimony fully responsive to both his own trial counsel’s and the\nprosecutor’s questions and demonstrated a detailed understanding of the\ntestimony and other evidence introduced during his capital murder trial.”\n      Additionally, Esparza’s penitentiary packets provided that he had an I.Q.\nof 86 in 1985 and an I.Q. of 88 in 1993. The experts’ testimony provided that\nthese scores are well above what a mentally retarded person would score. Dr.\nKern testified that a person’s intelligence score generally is stable and does not\nchange over a lifetime. There was expert testimony that although a person can\nscore below their actual level of intelligence, a person cannot score above their\nactual level of intelligence.\n\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 13 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                     No. 10-70009\n\n      In stark contrast to his previous I.Q. scores in the low average range in his\npenitentiary packets, Esparza scores fell within the range of mental retardation\nwhen he knew that he was being tested to determine whether he was eligible for\nthe death penalty. Indeed, one test score placed him in the range of profoundly\nretarded. Dr. Sparks, Dr. Kern, and Guerrero, who administered the tests for\nDr. Kern,4 believed that Esparza had low motivation to actually perform on the\ntests and believed the test results were invalid.           Dr. Sparks testified that\nEsparza understood that if he was deemed mentally retarded then he could not\nbe executed.\n      On the other hand, Esparza’s expert, Tussay, discounted the higher\nprevious I.Q. scores of 86 and 88 because the packets did not provide what test\nwas used. Tussay concluded that Esparza was mentally retarded. Tellingly,\nTussay admitted that this case was the first time she had evaluated an\nincarcerated individual for mental retardation. Both Dr. Kern and Dr. Sparks,\nhowever, had years of experience interacting with incarcerated individuals.\nIndeed, Dr. Kern was a psychologist at the University Health System, Detention\nHealth Care Services, and Dr. Sparks was the medical director of the Bexar\nCounty Detention Center. Finally, Dr. Arambula, Esparza’s expert, testified\nduring the punishment phase of the capital murder trial and opined that\nEsparza was of normal intelligence and thus he had not had Esparza tested for\nmental retardation. Under these circumstances, Esparza has not shown that the\nfinding of no subaverage intellectual functioning is debatable among reasonable\njurists. Because Esparza has failed to make a substantial showing on the first\nprong of the test, there is no need to address the remaining two prongs. See\nSalazar, 443 F.3d at 432 (“To state a successful claim, an applicant must satisfy\n\n\n\n      4\n        Guerrero’s clinical impression of Esparza was that his intelligence was in the low\naverage range.\n\n                                           13\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 14 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-70009\n\nall three pongs of this test.” (citation omitted)). Accordingly, we DENY a COA\nwith respect to his Atkins claim.\n\n\n\n\n            B.    JURY FINDING ON MENTAL RETARDATION\n      Citing Ring v. Arizona, Esparaza also contends that he is entitled to obtain\na jury finding on the issue of whether he is mentally retarded. 536 U.S. 584\n(2002). In Ring, the Supreme Court held that because a death sentence was\nauthorized only if an aggravating factor was present, the Sixth Amendment\nrequired that the aggravating factor must be proved to a jury. Id. at 603–09.\nThis Court has rejected the instant claim, explaining that neither Ring nor\nAtkins “render the absence of mental retardation the functional equivalent of an\nelement of capital murder which the state must prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” In re Johnson, 334 F.3d 403, 405 (5th Cir. 2003); see also Woods v.\nQuarterman, 493 F.3d 580, 585 n.3 (5th Cir. 2007).\n      Moreover, contrary to Esparza’s argument, the holding in Ring cannot be\napplied retroactively on collateral review. As a general matter, the Supreme\nCourt has explained that “Ring announced a new procedural rule that does not\napply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.”          Schriro v.\nSummerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 358 (2004).         Although Esparza recognizes that\nholding, he nonetheless contends that the decision should be revisited. We, of\ncourse, are bound by the Supreme Court’s decision. United States v. Jones, 132\nF.3d 232, 242 (5th Cir. 1998). Further, this Court has rejected his precise\ncontention in the context of a claim of mental retardation, explaining that this\n“claim does not meet the requirements of § 2244(b) because the claim that a jury\nmust determine mental retardation does not rely upon a new rule of\nconstitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court.” In re Woods, 155 F.\nApp’x 132, 134 (5th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we are constrained to find that this\n\n                                        14\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 15 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nclaim is not debatable among reasonable jurists. We DENY his motion for a\nCOA as to this claim.\n\n\n\n\n            C.     INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n      Esparza argues that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel was violated during the sentencing phase of his trial. He contends that\nhis trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence\nwith respect to his mental retardation.\n      To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Esparza must show (1)\ndefense counsel’s performance was deficient and (2) this deficient performance\nprejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). We\nmust find that trial counsel “made errors so serious that counsel was not\nfunctioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment.” Id. The\nSupreme Court instructs courts to look at the “norms of practice as reflected in\nthe American Bar Association and the like” and to consider “all the\ncircumstances” of a case. Id. at 688. While “[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel’s\nperformance must be highly deferential,” Esparza can demonstrate deficient\nperformance if he shows “that counsel’s representation fell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness.”      Id. at 688.    However, “[t]here is a ‘strong\npresumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance.’” United States v. Webster, 392 F.3d 787, 793 (5th Cir.\n2004) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). Strickland’s “prejudice” prong\nrequires a reasonable probability that, but for the deficient performance of his\ntrial counsel, the outcome of his capital murder trial would have been different.\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient\nto undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id.\n                   1.    Performance Prong\n\n                                        15\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 16 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70009\n\n       As previously set forth, Esparza contends that trial counsel rendered\nineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence\nof his mental retardation during the sentencing phase of his trial.            In\ndetermining whether trial counsel’s performance was deficient, our “focus [is] on\nwhether the investigation supporting counsel’s decision not to introduce\n[additional] mitigating evidence of [a petitioner’s] background was itself\nreasonable.” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 522–23 (2003). Thus, we must\nconsider the reasonableness of trial counsel’s investigation.\n      With respect to investigation, the record reveals that counsel requested the\nappointment of a forensic psychologist, a private investigator, and a DNA expert.\nCounsel also filed numerous discovery motions. Counsel interviewed at least\ntwo members of Esparza’s family—the two sisters who testified at the\npunishment phase of trial. Because Esparza has not submitted an affidavit from\ntrial counsel, the record does not contain the full extent of counsel’s\ninvestigation. However, as previously stated, Esparza must demonstrate that\ncounsel’s performance was deficient, Strickland, 466 U. S. at 687, and there is\na strong presumption that counsel’s investigation was reasonable. Webster, 392\nF.3d at 79.\n      Counsel obtained the appointment of Dr. Arambula, a forensic\npsychiatrist.   Dr. Arambula evaluated Esparza and testified during the\npunishment phase that he could not identify a specific mental illness. Dr.\nArambula also testified that Esparza was more unstable than a “normal” person\nbecause when he was six years old his mother was institutionalized for mental\nillness. As a result, he was temporarily sent to an orphanage. Although unable\nto diagnose an illness, Dr. Arambula suspected that Esparza had inherited a\n“genetic load” from his mentally ill mother.\n      Dr. Arambula testified that after Esparza’s mother remarried and his\nfather died, Esparza’s stepfather would regularly beat him.           It was Dr.\n\n                                       16\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 17 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nArambula’s opinion that the neglect and abuse Esparza suffered as a child did\nnot allow him to trust other people and made him prone to disagreement and\nphysical altercations. Dr. Arambula explained that a victim of domestic violence\ncan repeat the violent behaviors he has suffered.\n      Dr. Arambula noted that Esparza obtained a GED in prison. On cross\nexamination, the prosecutor asked whether he had administered any I.Q. tests\non Esparza. Dr. Arambula responded: “No. I didn’t believe that I needed to,\nbased on the evaluation.” The prosecutor then inquired: “Because he seems to\nhave normal intelligence?”     Dr. Arambula responded:        “Yes.”   Accordingly,\ndefense counsel had a mental health expert evaluate Esparza, and the expert’s\nconclusion was that Esparza was of “normal intelligence.”              Moreover, as\npreviously discussed, the evidence Esparza relies on to demonstrate his mental\nretardation is unpersuasive. Under these circumstances, Esparza has failed to\nmake a substantial showing that counsel’s performance with respect to\ninvestigating the issue of mental retardation was deficient.\n      It is not clear from the briefing, but it also appears that Esparza is arguing\nthat counsel’s presentation of the mitigating evidence about his childhood is\ndeficient.   Counsel was able to elicit testimony that Esparza’s mother was\ninstitutionalized when he was six years old, and, as a result, he was sent\ntemporarily to an orphanage. Subsequently, Esparza and his siblings were sent\nto live with their grandmother. His sisters testified that his mother was in the\nhospital once or twice a year due to her mental illness. The testimony also\ndemonstrated that Esparza was beaten by his stepfather. Further, one sister\nwas asked “how much schooling” Esparza had, and she replied: “Not much. . . .\nI know he stopped going to school because he had to help my mom to pay bills\nand all.” Esparza then began working in a restaurant and in construction.\nAdditionally, counsel elicited testimony from Dr. Arambula that the highly\nstructured setting in prison would make Esparza less likely to be a future\n\n                                        17\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 18 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-70009\n\ndanger, which is mitigating evidence with respect to the first question given to\nthe jury after the punishment phase.5             Although Esparza claims counsel’s\nquestioning of the mitigation witnesses was “very superficial,” he has wholly\nfailed to explain what else counsel should have elicited from the mitigation\nwitnesses. As such, he has failed to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would\nfind debatable his claim that counsel’s performance with respect to investigating\nand presenting the evidence in mitigation was deficient.\n                     2.     Prejudice Prong\n       Because Esparza made an insufficient showing on the first prong of the\ntest, it is unnecessary for this Court to address the second prong–whether\ncounsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\nNonetheless, we briefly state that it is clear that Esparza has failed to make a\nsufficient showing of prejudice. In the context of a claim that counsel failed to\ndiscover and present mitigating evidence, to determine whether a petitioner has\nshown the required prejudice, “we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against\nthe totality of available mitigating evidence.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534.\n       Here, the aggravating evidence included evidence that Esparza kidnapped\na 7-year old girl from her home in the middle of the night, raped and sodomized\nher, and strangled her to death.            Esparza had a previous conviction for\naggravated sexual assault, and the victim of that crime testified at the\npunishment phase of this trial. She recounted how Esparza hit her in the head\n\n\n       5\n          The first question is: “Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthere is a probability that the Defendant, Guadalupe Esparza, would commit criminal acts of\nviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?” The second question is:\n\n       State whether, taking into consideration all the evidence, including the\n       circumstances of the offense, the defendant’s character and background, and the\n       personal moral culpability of the Defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating\n       circumstance or are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that a\n       sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.\n\n\n                                             18\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 19 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70009\n\nwith his gun and raped her at gunpoint after asking her for a ride home in her\ncar. Another victim testified that Esparza choked her and attempted to rape\nher. Shortly before the instant crime, Esparza put his hand underneath the\nclothes of a little girl as she was sleeping. The evidence showed that as a\njuvenile he attempted to rob another child of his mini-bike at knife point.\nEsparza also was the “getaway” driver when two other individuals were stealing\nparts from a vehicle. Finally, Esparza had received disciplinary reports in\nprison, including an incident in which he was kicking another inmate in the side\nwhile the inmate was lying on the ground.\n      With respect to his claimed evidence of mental retardation, as we\npreviously discussed, the evidence indicates that Esparza was not actually\nmentally retarded. Thus, in light of the aggravating evidence presented to the\njury, we are unpersuaded that Esparza has made a substantial showing that\nthere is a reasonable probability that, had his additional mitigating evidence\nbeen presented, the outcome of the sentencing hearing would have been\ndifferent. In other words, we are persuaded that reasonable jurists would not\nfind Esparza’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel debatable. We therefore\nDENY a COA as to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n      IV.   CONCLUSION\n      For the above reasons, the motion for COA is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f",

Esparza then filed a\nfederal petition for writ of habeas corpus, which the district court denied in a\nmemorandum opinion and order. Esparza v. Quarterman, No. 07-265 (W.D. Tex.\nMar. 24, 2010). The district court also denied a COA. Esparza now requests a\nCOA from this Court.\n      II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      Esparza filed his 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus after\nthe effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).\nThe petition, therefore, is subject to AEDPA. See Lindh v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n                                         <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 3 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\n320, 336 (1997). Pursuant to the federal habeas statute, as amended by AEDPA,\nwe defer to a state court’s adjudication of a petitioner’s claims on the merits\nunless the state court’s decision was: (1) “contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States”; or (2) “resulted in a decision that was\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\npresented in the State court proceeding.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). A state court’s\ndecision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it reaches a legal\nconclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it\nreaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially\nindistinguishable facts.

A\nstate court’s decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law if it is “objectively unreasonable.” Id. at 409. Further,\npursuant to § 2254(e)(1), state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct,\nand the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness\nby clear and convincing evidence.

Esparza contends that he is mentally retarded, and thus is ineligible\nfor the death penalty. Subsequent to Atkins, Texas courts have followed the\ndefinition of “mental retardation” adopted by the American Association on\nMental Retardation and the nearly identical definition set forth in § 591.003(13)\nof the Texas Health & Safety Code. In re Salazar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793885\"><a href=\"/opinion/793885/in-re-robert-madrid-salazar-movant/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432 (5th Cir.\n2006).

During this\nhearing, several expert witnesses testified regarding Esparza’s I.Q. scores and\nadaptive functioning.    Also, his sister testified about his childhood, and\nEsparza’s prison and school records were admitted.\n                   1.   Lynda Tussay\n      Esparza called Lynda Tussay to testify. Tussay is a licensed professional\ncounselor and has a master’s degree in Human Development and Counseling.\nTussay interviewed Esparza and administered intelligence tests. She testified\nthat the range of mental retardation was a 70 I.Q. or lower. Esparza scored a\n71 (standard error of plus or minus 5 points) on the Raven’s Standard\nProgressive Matrices Test.    With respect to the Revised Minnesota Paper\nFormboard Test, Esparza scored a 73 (standard error of plus or minus 4 points).\nTussay explained that the above two scores were within the range of borderline\nintellectual functioning. On the achievement tests, Esparza was at the level of\nfirst grade math and below the level of first grade on this spelling test. On\nanother spelling test, he scored at the level of grade 6.3. Esparza’s vocabulary\nwas at a grade level of 6.2, and his reading comprehension was at a 4.7 grade\nlevel. Tussay also administered the Comprehensive Trail-Making Test, and\nEsparza scored better than 58 percent of the population. On that test, a score\nof under 40 percent would indicate mental retardation. With respect to the\nControlled Oral Word Association Test, Esparza scored 25.82, which is nearly\n\n                                       5\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 6 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70009\n\nfour full standard deviations below the mean, which is 48.43. Tussay testified\nthat the score indicates “a person who does not do well with any kind of form of\nwritten language.”\n      The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Test is a questionnaire for the\ncaregiver of the person being tested regarding the subject’s developmental\nhistory. Tussay explained that this test is the “essential measure, the one that\nmost psychologists use when using the adaptive behavior scales.”            She\nadministered the test to Esparza’s older sister, Esther Moncado, who was\nEsparza’s primary caregiver when he was a child. The mean score is 100, and\nEsparza’s score was below 20, which is the “lowest score” possible.\n      Tussay further testified that she “can usually tell when someone is trying\nto not do a good job. That wasn’t what he was trying to do.” In her opinion,\n“there was no deliberate sabotage on his part. He just did not understand. He\njust didn’t understand what I was trying to tell him.” In Tussay’s opinion,\nEsparza “meets all of the criteria for mental retardation.”\n      During the cross examination of Tussay, the prosecutor produced two of\nEsparza’s penitentiary packets, which included the Texas Department of\nCorrections Social and Criminal History page. The first packet provided that in\n1985 Esparza had an I.Q. score of 86. The second packet provided that in 1993\nEsparza had an I.Q. score of 88. After reviewing the packets, Tussay testified\nthat she could not “formulate an opinion based on” them because she did “not\nknow what they based their tests on.” The packets did not provide what specific\ntests were administered to Esparza. She also admitted that Esparza heard from\nhis lawyer that if he was mentally retarded, then the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Atkins would bar his execution.\n      Additionally, Tussay testified that during her interview of Esparza she\nnoticed that Esparza was “able to speak very well.” She discovered that his\nfamily had done migrant farm work and thus “he was not really ever very rooted\n\n                                       6\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 7 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nin any one school.” Esparza had been in special education classes and failed the\nninth grade three times before dropping out of high school. Tussay also stated\nthat Esparza told her that he failed the test for a GED but that the instructor\nissued a GED so that the instructor would be compensated.\n      Tussay also spoke with Esparza’s older sister who indicated that Esparza\nhad a “history of adaptive problems.” His sister had “difficulty in teaching him\nhow to tie his shoes, how to dress himself. It took longer and he was older before\nhe was able to attain those skills.”     Esparza did not “play like the other\nchildren.” For example, he did not develop “imaginary games.”\n                  2.     Recording of Jail Phone Calls\n      Esparza was moved from death row to Bexar County Jail during the time\nof the state writ evidentiary hearing. Sergeant Mark Gibson of the Bexar\nCounty Sheriff’s office submitted a recording of three phone calls made by\nEsparza during his stay at county jail. The recording was played at the writ\nhearing. Esparza identified himself at the beginning of each phone call. He\nhelped arrange a three-way conference call. He spoke to his attorney about the\nimpending court proceedings. He referred to the Supreme Court’s opinion in\nAtkins as the “2002 case.” Esparza boasted that his attorney was very good and\nhad gotten other inmates off death row. Esparza recounted to another person\nwhat his attorney had told him about the need to postpone the hearing. In one\nphone call, Esparza was advising another inmate’s family regarding that\ninmate’s civil suit against jail officials. Esparza also informed one person that\nhe could only have visitors on Mondays and Wednesdays. He complained that\nthe phone cards were unfairly charging too much money for the minutes\nprovided.\n                  3.     Dr. Kern\n      The State called Dr. Paul Kern, Ph.D., a psychologist at the University\nHealth System, Detention Health Care Services. Dr. Kern testified that Joanna\n\n                                        7\n\f     Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 8 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-70009\n\nW. Guerrero, a psychometrist with a master’s degree, administered two different\nintelligence tests and an achievement test to Esparza. Esparza scored in the\nmildly mentally retarded range on the intelligence tests, and his achievement\ntest score suggested very poor basic academic skills. Dr. Kern interviewed\nEsparza and interpreted the test scores.\n      Together Dr. Kern and Guerrero compiled a Summary of Intellectual\nTesting that was submitted to the state court. This report provided that, based\non Guerrero’s clinical impression, she estimated Esparza’s intelligence was\nwithin the low average range.1 The report provided that Esparza “displayed an\nextremely low level of motivation while responding to knowledge-based\nquestions, providing a large number of ‘I don’t know’ responses and displaying\na strong hesitance to venture guesses.”              His responses to knowledge-based\nquestions “were almost always incorrect.” Esparza responded that the current\nPresident of the United States was “Ford.” He reported that the United States\nflag colors are red, white, and green. Based on his responses, it was “strongly\nsuspected that he was intentionally performing below the level of his\ncapabilities.”    For example, “it was subsequently learned that although he\nprovided a blatantly incorrect definition of a thermometer during the mental\nstatus examination, he had previously provided a correct definition for the same\nterm during the psychological testing.” Esparza performed very poorly on a\nsimple memory task. The examiner noted that “it is rare . . . to see performance\nas poor as Mr. Esparza’s on the task even among young children with low\nintelligence and relatively severe Attention/Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.”\nAlso, during the time Esparza was not being asked knowledge-based questions,\nhis presentation “was suggestive of a much higher level of functioning, and a\nclinical estimate of his intelligence based on both his general presentation and\n\n\n\n      1\n          Guerrero did not testify at the hearing.\n\n                                              8\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 9 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nthe available historical information would place it somewhere within the Low\nAverage range.”\n       Dr. Kern testified that Esparza was able to read and understand his\nrights. Indeed, during one meeting, Esparza stopped the interview and asked\nfor counsel in order to obtain advice regarding whether to cooperate. Esparza\nretrieved his attorney’s business card from his cell and successfully contacted his\nattorney.   After consulting with counsel, Esparza decided to complete the\ninterview. Dr. Kern testified that Esparza’s presentation during the interview\ndid not appear to be that of a mentally retarded person. Dr. Kern concluded that\nEsparza’s motivation to do well on the I.Q. tests “was very low” and that the test\nresults were invalid or inaccurate. Esparza’s test score on the Vineland adaptive\nbehavior scale, which had been previously administered by Tussay, indicated\nthat he was profoundly retarded. Dr. Kern explained that a person of that level\nof intelligence or adaptive behavior “would be capable of doing almost nothing.\nA profoundly mentally retarded person, for example, would have no hope at all\nof ever learning language at all. They would have no hope at all of . . . ever\nhaving a job, probably. They would not be able to communicate at all.” Such a\nperson “would probably spend their whole life in an institution for the mentally\nretarded sitting in a corner oblivious to anything.” Dr. Kern explained that a\nperson can test below their intelligence level but not above it.       He further\ntestified that I.Q. scores generally do not change over a person’s life. Dr. Kern\nopined that Esparza’s scores of 88 and 86 in the penitentiary packets were\nconsistent with his clinical assessments regarding Esparza’s functioning.\nFurther, Esparza’s taped phone conversations suggest a higher level of\nfunctioning than the current test scores indicate. In Dr. Kern’s opinion, the\ncurrent test results provide “dramatic underestimates of Mr. Esparza’s\nknowledge and ability and are best viewed as invalid.”\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 10 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                      No. 10-70009\n\n      Dr. Kern also noted that during Esparza’s 2001 trial Dr. Arambula, a\nforensic psychiatrist, had testified that he did not have Esparza tested for\nmental retardation because he thought Esparza’s intelligence was “normal.” 2 Dr.\nKern is familiar with Dr. Arambula and relied in part upon his opinion in\nassessing Esparza. Finally, Dr. Kern testified that, based on the test results and\nhis clinical assessments, he did not think that Esparza was mentally retarded.\nInstead, as set forth in his report, Esparza’s “intellectual capabilities most likely\nfall somewhere within the Low Average range.”\n                     4.     Dr. Sparks\n      The State also called Dr. John Sparks, a psychiatrist and medical director\nof the Bexar County Detention Center. Previously, in his capacity as the medical\ndirector, Dr. Sparks had seen Esparza because of a treatment issue. Dr. Sparks\ntestified that Esparza “conveyed to me what he needed in a very clear and\nconcise way.”\n      At the request of the state court, Dr. Sparks interviewed Esparza and also\nreviewed the report issued by Dr. Kern. Dr. Sparks’ evaluation of Esparza\nprovides that he “is aware that it may lead to the death sentence if he is not\nretarded or may lead to life in prison if he is retarded.” Dr. Sparks concluded\nthat Esparza was not mentally retarded. Although Dr. Sparks acknowledged\nthat the current test scores were in the mildly mentally retarded range, his\nevaluation provided as follows:\n      [E]vidence from multiple sources suggest that the present test\n      results provide marked underestimates of his intellectual\n      capabilities. He displayed “pervasive evidence of poor test taking\n      attitude characterized by low motivation, poor attention and\n      concentration, and low task involvement and persistence.”[3 ] He\n\n\n      2\n          Dr. Arambula’s testimony will be more fully discussed infra in the context of\nEsparza’s claim of ineffective assistance.\n      3\n          Dr. Sparks’ evaluation was quoting from Dr. Kern’s report.\n\n                                            10\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 11 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-70009\n\n      made minimal effort in the testing although his abilities to\n      communicate and his ability to handle general living situations\n      seem well above the mentally retarded range. He had long term\n      gainful employment and knew how to drive and passed the drivers\n      test.\n\n      Dr. Sparks’ evaluation also found that Esparza’s functioning “was well\nabove the retardation level.” Dr. Sparks found that Esparza communicated very\nwell. Although Esparza does not write well, he “understands language better\nthan a retarded person can.” Esparza did not receive a good education and thus\n“has difficulty in writing communications.” However, his “adaptive ablity is\nexcellent.” Dr. Sparks found that the I.Q. scores of 86 and 88 contained in the\nprison records were consistent with his opinion that Esparza is not mentally\nretarded. Although Dr. Sparks initially estimated that Esparza had borderline\nintellectual functioning, after hearing Esparza’s taped phone conversations, he\nestimated that Esparza’s I.Q. would be “77 or 78, closer to 80, which would be\nthen low average.”\n                   5.    Esther Moncada\n      Esparza’s older sister, Esther Moncada, testified at the hearing that\nEsparza was a “slow learner” and had trouble tying his shoe laces. Their mother\nwas hospitalized after a mental breakdown when Esparza was about five or six\nyears old. Their father moved out of state, and the children were placed in an\norphanage until an uncle brought them back to San Antonio. Their father died\nwhen Esparza was ten or eleven years old. Moncada further testified that\nEsparza ate with his hands and had difficulty dressing himself. He dropped out\nof school after failing ninth grade three times and worked as a laborer. Esparza\ncould read and write “a little.”\n                   6.    State Court Finding of No Mental Retardation\n      The state trial court denied relief on this claim, concluding that Esparza\nhad failed to establish that he is mentally retarded. The Court of Criminal\n\n                                       11\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 12 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-70009\n\nAppeals expressly adopted this finding. Esparza challenges the state court’s\nfinding, contending that there was sufficient evidence to find that he was\nmentally retarded.\n      As previously set forth, Esparza has the burden of proving by a\npreponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded. Salazar, 443 F.3d\nat 432. The first prong of the test is whether he has significant subaverage\nintellectual function, usually defined as an I.Q. score of 70 or below. Briseno,\n135 S.W.3d at 7.\n      We first note that Judge Mary Roman of the 175th Judicial District Court\nof Bexar County presided over both Esparza’s trial and the state evidentiary\nhearing. As such, Judge Roman was able to observe Esparza testify in his own\ndefense during his capital trial.     During trial Esparza was asked to read a\nrequest that he had handwritten at the jail. From the witness stand, Esparza\nread aloud as follows: “I would like to ask you if I can be in segregation by\nmyself because I no longer trust nobody because there is a lot of people that don’t\nlike me because of a charge that I have, Capital case. I would like to be housed\nby myself for my own safety.” Moreover, we agree with the federal district court\nthat “[t]hroughout his trial testimony, [Esparza] furnished coherent, even\ncombative testimony fully responsive to both his own trial counsel’s and the\nprosecutor’s questions and demonstrated a detailed understanding of the\ntestimony and other evidence introduced during his capital murder trial.”\n      Additionally, Esparza’s penitentiary packets provided that he had an I.Q.\nof 86 in 1985 and an I.Q. of 88 in 1993. The experts’ testimony provided that\nthese scores are well above what a mentally retarded person would score. Dr.\nKern testified that a person’s intelligence score generally is stable and does not\nchange over a lifetime. There was expert testimony that although a person can\nscore below their actual level of intelligence, a person cannot score above their\nactual level of intelligence.\n\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 13 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                     No. 10-70009\n\n      In stark contrast to his previous I.Q. scores in the low average range in his\npenitentiary packets, Esparza scores fell within the range of mental retardation\nwhen he knew that he was being tested to determine whether he was eligible for\nthe death penalty. Indeed, one test score placed him in the range of profoundly\nretarded. Dr. Sparks, Dr. Kern, and Guerrero, who administered the tests for\nDr. Kern,4 believed that Esparza had low motivation to actually perform on the\ntests and believed the test results were invalid.           Dr. Sparks testified that\nEsparza understood that if he was deemed mentally retarded then he could not\nbe executed.\n      On the other hand, Esparza’s expert, Tussay, discounted the higher\nprevious I.Q. scores of 86 and 88 because the packets did not provide what test\nwas used. Tussay concluded that Esparza was mentally retarded. Tellingly,\nTussay admitted that this case was the first time she had evaluated an\nincarcerated individual for mental retardation. Both Dr. Kern and Dr. Sparks,\nhowever, had years of experience interacting with incarcerated individuals.\nIndeed, Dr. Kern was a psychologist at the University Health System, Detention\nHealth Care Services, and Dr. Sparks was the medical director of the Bexar\nCounty Detention Center. Finally, Dr. Arambula, Esparza’s expert, testified\nduring the punishment phase of the capital murder trial and opined that\nEsparza was of normal intelligence and thus he had not had Esparza tested for\nmental retardation. Under these circumstances, Esparza has not shown that the\nfinding of no subaverage intellectual functioning is debatable among reasonable\njurists. Because Esparza has failed to make a substantial showing on the first\nprong of the test, there is no need to address the remaining two prongs. See\nSalazar, 443 F.3d at 432 (“To state a successful claim, an applicant must satisfy\n\n\n\n      4\n        Guerrero’s clinical impression of Esparza was that his intelligence was in the low\naverage range.\n\n                                           13\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 14 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-70009\n\nall three pongs of this test.” (citation omitted)). Accordingly, we DENY a COA\nwith respect to his Atkins claim.\n\n\n\n\n            B.    JURY FINDING ON MENTAL RETARDATION\n      Citing Ring v. Arizona, Esparaza also contends that he is entitled to obtain\na jury finding on the issue of whether he is mentally retarded. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2002). In Ring, the Supreme Court held that because a death sentence was\nauthorized only if an aggravating factor was present, the Sixth Amendment\nrequired that the aggravating factor must be proved to a jury. Id. at 603–09.\nThis Court has rejected the instant claim, explaining that neither Ring nor\nAtkins “render the absence of mental retardation the functional equivalent of an\nelement of capital murder which the state must prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” In re Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782515\"><a href=\"/opinion/782515/in-re-kia-levoy-johnson-movant/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (5th Cir. 2003); see also Woods v.\nQuarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"50981\"><a href=\"/opinion/50981/woods-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585 n.3 (5th Cir. 2007).\n      Moreover, contrary to Esparza’s argument, the holding in Ring cannot be\napplied retroactively on collateral review. As a general matter, the Supreme\nCourt has explained that “Ring announced a new procedural rule that does not\napply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.”          Schriro v.\nSummerlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136996\"><a href=\"/opinion/136996/schriro-v-summerlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358 (2004).         Although Esparza recognizes that\nholding, he nonetheless contends that the decision should be revisited. We, of\ncourse, are bound by the Supreme Court’s decision. United States v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749808\"><a href=\"/opinion/749808/united-states-v-louis-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (5th Cir. 1998). Further, this Court has rejected his precise\ncontention in the context of a claim of mental retardation, explaining that this\n“claim does not meet the requirements of § 2244(b) because the claim that a jury\nmust determine mental retardation does not rely upon a new rule of\nconstitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court.” In re Woods, 155 F.\nApp’x 132, 134 (5th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we are constrained to find that this\n\n                                        14\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 15 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nclaim is not debatable among reasonable jurists. We DENY his motion for a\nCOA as to this claim.\n\n\n\n\n            C.     INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n      Esparza argues that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel was violated during the sentencing phase of his trial. He contends that\nhis trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence\nwith respect to his mental retardation.\n      To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Esparza must show (1)\ndefense counsel’s performance was deficient and (2) this deficient performance\nprejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1984). We\nmust find that trial counsel “made errors so serious that counsel was not\nfunctioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment.” Id. The\nSupreme Court instructs courts to look at the “norms of practice as reflected in\nthe American Bar Association and the like” and to consider “all the\ncircumstances” of a case. Id. at 688. While “[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel’s\nperformance must be highly deferential,” Esparza can demonstrate deficient\nperformance if he shows “that counsel’s representation fell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness.”      Id. at 688.    However, “[t]here is a ‘strong\npresumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance.’” United States v. Webster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793 (5th Cir.\n2004) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). Strickland’s “prejudice” prong\nrequires a reasonable probability that, but for the deficient performance of his\ntrial counsel, the outcome of his capital murder trial would have been different.\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient\nto undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id.\n                   1.    Performance Prong\n\n                                        15\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 16 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70009\n\n       As previously set forth, Esparza contends that trial counsel rendered\nineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence\nof his mental retardation during the sentencing phase of his trial.            In\ndetermining whether trial counsel’s performance was deficient, our “focus [is] on\nwhether the investigation supporting counsel’s decision not to introduce\n[additional] mitigating evidence of [a petitioner’s] background was itself\nreasonable.” Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522–23 (2003). Thus, we must\nconsider the reasonableness of trial counsel’s investigation.\n      With respect to investigation, the record reveals that counsel requested the\nappointment of a forensic psychologist, a private investigator, and a DNA expert.\nCounsel also filed numerous discovery motions. Counsel interviewed at least\ntwo members of Esparza’s family—the two sisters who testified at the\npunishment phase of trial. Because Esparza has not submitted an affidavit from\ntrial counsel, the record does not contain the full extent of counsel’s\ninvestigation. However, as previously stated, Esparza must demonstrate that\ncounsel’s performance was deficient, Strickland, 466 U. S. at 687, and there is\na strong presumption that counsel’s investigation was reasonable. Webster, 392\nF.3d at 79.\n      Counsel obtained the appointment of Dr. Arambula, a forensic\npsychiatrist.   Dr. Arambula evaluated Esparza and testified during the\npunishment phase that he could not identify a specific mental illness. Dr.\nArambula also testified that Esparza was more unstable than a “normal” person\nbecause when he was six years old his mother was institutionalized for mental\nillness. As a result, he was temporarily sent to an orphanage. Although unable\nto diagnose an illness, Dr. Arambula suspected that Esparza had inherited a\n“genetic load” from his mentally ill mother.\n      Dr. Arambula testified that after Esparza’s mother remarried and his\nfather died, Esparza’s stepfather would regularly beat him.           It was Dr.\n\n                                       16\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 17 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70009\n\nArambula’s opinion that the neglect and abuse Esparza suffered as a child did\nnot allow him to trust other people and made him prone to disagreement and\nphysical altercations. Dr. Arambula explained that a victim of domestic violence\ncan repeat the violent behaviors he has suffered.\n      Dr. Arambula noted that Esparza obtained a GED in prison. On cross\nexamination, the prosecutor asked whether he had administered any I.Q. tests\non Esparza. Dr. Arambula responded: “No. I didn’t believe that I needed to,\nbased on the evaluation.” The prosecutor then inquired: “Because he seems to\nhave normal intelligence?”     Dr. Arambula responded:        “Yes.”   Accordingly,\ndefense counsel had a mental health expert evaluate Esparza, and the expert’s\nconclusion was that Esparza was of “normal intelligence.”              Moreover, as\npreviously discussed, the evidence Esparza relies on to demonstrate his mental\nretardation is unpersuasive. Under these circumstances, Esparza has failed to\nmake a substantial showing that counsel’s performance with respect to\ninvestigating the issue of mental retardation was deficient.\n      It is not clear from the briefing, but it also appears that Esparza is arguing\nthat counsel’s presentation of the mitigating evidence about his childhood is\ndeficient.   Counsel was able to elicit testimony that Esparza’s mother was\ninstitutionalized when he was six years old, and, as a result, he was sent\ntemporarily to an orphanage. Subsequently, Esparza and his siblings were sent\nto live with their grandmother. His sisters testified that his mother was in the\nhospital once or twice a year due to her mental illness. The testimony also\ndemonstrated that Esparza was beaten by his stepfather. Further, one sister\nwas asked “how much schooling” Esparza had, and she replied: “Not much. . . .\nI know he stopped going to school because he had to help my mom to pay bills\nand all.” Esparza then began working in a restaurant and in construction.\nAdditionally, counsel elicited testimony from Dr. Arambula that the highly\nstructured setting in prison would make Esparza less likely to be a future\n\n                                        17\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 18 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-70009\n\ndanger, which is mitigating evidence with respect to the first question given to\nthe jury after the punishment phase.5             Although Esparza claims counsel’s\nquestioning of the mitigation witnesses was “very superficial,” he has wholly\nfailed to explain what else counsel should have elicited from the mitigation\nwitnesses. As such, he has failed to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would\nfind debatable his claim that counsel’s performance with respect to investigating\nand presenting the evidence in mitigation was deficient.\n                     2.     Prejudice Prong\n       Because Esparza made an insufficient showing on the first prong of the\ntest, it is unnecessary for this Court to address the second prong–whether\ncounsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\nNonetheless, we briefly state that it is clear that Esparza has failed to make a\nsufficient showing of prejudice. In the context of a claim that counsel failed to\ndiscover and present mitigating evidence, to determine whether a petitioner has\nshown the required prejudice, “we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against\nthe totality of available mitigating evidence.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534.\n       Here, the aggravating evidence included evidence that Esparza kidnapped\na 7-year old girl from her home in the middle of the night, raped and sodomized\nher, and strangled her to death.            Esparza had a previous conviction for\naggravated sexual assault, and the victim of that crime testified at the\npunishment phase of this trial. She recounted how Esparza hit her in the head\n\n\n       5\n          The first question is: “Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthere is a probability that the Defendant, Guadalupe Esparza, would commit criminal acts of\nviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?” The second question is:\n\n       State whether, taking into consideration all the evidence, including the\n       circumstances of the offense, the defendant’s character and background, and the\n       personal moral culpability of the Defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating\n       circumstance or are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that a\n       sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.\n\n\n                                             18\n\f    Case: 10-70009 Document: 00511289378 Page: 19 Date Filed: 11/09/2010\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70009\n\nwith his gun and raped her at gunpoint after asking her for a ride home in her\ncar. Another victim testified that Esparza choked her and attempted to rape\nher. Shortly before the instant crime, Esparza put his hand underneath the\nclothes of a little girl as she was sleeping. The evidence showed that as a\njuvenile he attempted to rob another child of his mini-bike at knife point.\nEsparza also was the “getaway” driver when two other individuals were stealing\nparts from a vehicle. Finally, Esparza had received disciplinary reports in\nprison, including an incident in which he was kicking another inmate in the side\nwhile the inmate was lying on the ground.\n      With respect to his claimed evidence of mental retardation, as we\npreviously discussed, the evidence indicates that Esparza was not actually\nmentally retarded. Thus, in light of the aggravating evidence presented to the\njury, we are unpersuaded that Esparza has made a substantial showing that\nthere is a reasonable probability that, had his additional mitigating evidence\nbeen presented, the outcome of the sentencing hearing would have been\ndifferent. In other words, we are persuaded that reasonable jurists would not\nfind Esparza’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel debatable. We therefore\nDENY a COA as to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n      IV.   CONCLUSION\n      For the above reasons, the motion for COA is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f</pre>",
