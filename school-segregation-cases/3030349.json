He has been incarcerated since 1998 for felony possession of .12 grams of\n\nmethamphetamine. He turned 65 years old in January 2016.\n\n       After the passage of Proposition 36 and Proposition 47, defendant filed separate\n\npetitions under Penal Code sections 1170.126 and 1170.181 for recall of his indeterminate\n\nsentence of 26 years to life. Defendant argues the trial court erred when it found\n\ndefendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied both\n\npetitions. (§§ 1170.126, subds. (f) and (g), 1170.18, subd. (b).) As to the first petition,\n\nhe contends the trial court abused its discretion. As to the second petition, he argues\n\ndangerousness must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court employed\n\nthe wrong criteria for evaluating dangerousness.\n\n       Our review of the record concludes that a preponderance of the evidence amply\n\nsupported the trial court’s exercise of its discretion. It is unnecessary to prove\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Absent any statutory indication, the burden of\n\nproof is by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial\n\ncourt’s determination was not irrational or arbitrary according to the standard of a\n\nreasonable person. Defendant’s criminal and prison history demonstrates that he has not\n\n       1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fbeen rehabilitated. Furthermore, defendant has not rebutted the presumption that the trial\n\ncourt appropriately applied the relevant law. We affirm the judgment.\n\n                                             II\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n\nA. Defendant’s 1998 Commitment Offense and Initial Appeal\n\n       Defendant’s 1998 commitment offense involved possession of .12 grams of\n\nmethamphetamine. In 1997, defendant was involved in an altercation with his family\n\nmembers and neighbors. Beforehand, another of the people involved gave him the\n\nmethamphetamine and asked him to dispose of it. (People v. Martin (2001) 25 Cal.4th\n\n1180, 1182-1183.) “Ultimately, defendant wound up outside in the alley behind the\n\nhouse, facing a group of adults, [composed] of family members and neighbors[,] as he\n\nscreamed and swung a metal pipe around himself in an arc, as one would swing a\n\nbaseball bat. Defendant also picked up and threw rocks at the group, hitting a neighbor,\n\nNaomi Biggs, in the leg. Nicole Trip testified that as she tried to go past defendant to\n\nenter the house to call police, [] defendant stepped in her direction and took a ‘full swing’\n\nat her with the pipe. She ‘jump[ed] back’ and the pipe missed her by three or four feet.\n\nDefendant did not actually hit anyone with the pipe during the episode.” (Id. at p. 1183.)\n\nAfter police arrested defendant, they searched his pants pockets and discovered a ‘bindle’\n\ncontaining .12 grams of methamphetamine. He claimed the drug was not his. (Ibid.)\n\n       A jury convicted defendant of three offenses: felony assault with a deadly weapon\n\n(§ 245, subd. (a)(l) [swinging the pipe at victim Nicole Trip]); possession of\n\n                                              3\n\fmethamphetamine (Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)); and misdemeanor battery\n\n(§ 242 [(hitting Naomi Biggs with rocks)].) The court found true the enhancement\n\nallegations that defendant had not remained free of convictions for five years after\n\nserving a prison term (§ 667.5, subd. (b)) and had previously been convicted of three\n\nserious and violent felonies. (§§ 667, subds. (c) & (e), 1170.12, subd. (c); People v.\n\nMartin, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 1183-1184.)\n\n       At sentencing on December 19, 1998, the court expressly declined to exercise its\n\ndiscretion under section 1385 to strike any of the prior convictions. Defendant was\n\nsentenced to two concurrent prison terms of 25 years to life for both of the felony\n\nconvictions; one concurrent term of six months in county jail for the misdemeanor battery\n\nconviction; and a one-year consecutive prison term for not having remained free of\n\nimprisonment or felony convictions for five years. (People v. Martin, supra, 25 Cal.4th\n\nat p. 1184.)\n\n       After this court reversed defendant’s conviction of assault with a deadly weapon\n\nfor insufficiency of evidence and vacated the 25-year-to-life indeterminate term for that\n\noffense, the California Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. (People v. Martin, supra,\n\n25 Cal.4th at pp. 1184, 1193.) Consequently, defendant is serving a sentence of 26 years\n\nto life based on his felony conviction for possession of .12 grams of methamphetamine.\n\nDefendant has now been incarcerated for about 17 years.\n\nB. The Denial of Defendant’s Section 1170.126 Petition\n\n       After passage of Proposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the\n\n                                             4\n\fReform Act), section 1170.126 provides a resentencing option to “persons presently\n\nserving an indeterminate term of imprisonment pursuant to” the Three Strikes Law.\n\n(Reform Act, § 6.)\n\n         On December 3, 2012, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence. On May\n\n31, 2013, the trial court determined that he was eligible to petition for recall but denied\n\nhis petition on the grounds that he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\nDefendant appealed, and this court reversed the judgment in an unpublished opinion, on\n\nthe grounds that defendant was denied his constitutional and statutory rights by not\n\nreceiving an opportunity to appear personally at the dangerousness hearing, and that he\n\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to communicate with\n\nhim before the hearing. (People v. Martin (July 21, 2014, E058888) [nonpub. opn.] at pp.\n\n9-10.)\n\n         On remand, defendant personally appeared at the second petition hearing on\n\nDecember 17, 2014. The trial court again determined that defendant posed an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied his petition. Defendant filed a\n\nnotice of appeal challenging the second denial of his section 1170.126 petition.\n\nC. Defendant’s Petition for Recall of Sentence Filed Under Section 1170.18\n\n         In November 2014, the enactment of Proposition 47, The Safe Neighborhoods and\n\nSchools Act (the Safe Act), mandated “misdemeanors instead of felonies for nonserious,\n\nnonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant has prior\n\nconvictions for specified violent or serious crimes.” (Safe Act, § 3, subd. (3).) In\n\n                                              5\n\faddition, the Safe Act authorized “consideration of resentencing for anyone who is\n\ncurrently serving a sentence for any of the offenses listed herein that are now\n\nmisdemeanors.” (Safe Act, § 3, subd. (4).) The Safe Act added section 1170.18 (Safe\n\nAct, § 14), which provides a resentencing option to “person[s] currently serving a\n\nsentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would\n\nhave been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (‘this act’) had\n\nthis act been in effect at the time of the offense . . . .” (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).)\n\n       Defendant filed a petition for resentencing under section 1170.18 to convert his\n\nfelony conviction for possession to a misdemeanor. On March 13, 2015, the trial court\n\ndenied his petition on the grounds that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety. Defendant filed a notice of appeal challenging the denial of his section\n\n1170.18 petition.\n\n                                               III\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n       Defendant claims the trial court erred by determining that he poses an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety under sections 1170.126 and 1170.18. He\n\nspecifically argues that his criminal history and prison records do not demonstrate that he\n\ncurrently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to the public. However, the evidence of\n\ndefendant’s behavior, both in and out of custody, supports the trial court’s dangerousness\n\ndetermination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fA. Standard of Review\n\n       In his opening brief, defendant concedes the relevant standard of review applied to\n\na ruling of dangerousness on a section 1170.126 petition is abuse of discretion. However,\n\nin his supplemental opening brief, defendant argues the court’s dangerousness\n\ndetermination on a section 1170.18 petition must be based on a finding beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, rather than by a preponderance of the evidence. We hold both petitions\n\nare subject to review for abuse of discretion.\n\n       In Sentencing California Crimes, the authors describe the standard of review for\n\nsection 1170.126 and section 1170.18 petitions. The denial of resentencing based on\n\ndangerousness is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. The plain language of both section\n\n1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g), and section 1170.18, subdivision (b), calls for an\n\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion: “‘Discretion is the power to make the\n\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367,\n\n375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\n\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\n\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\n\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\n\nRodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125; see People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n\n148, 162 [abuse-of-discretion review asks whether ruling in question falls outside bounds\n\nof reason under applicable law and relevant facts]; Couzens et al., Sentencing Cal.\n\nCrimes (The Rutter Group 2015) §§ 20.68 and 25.10.)\n\n                                              7\n\f       Section 1170.18 does not state what standard of proof should be employed.\n\nHowever, the only sentence adjustment possible is a reduction. According to the\n\nresentencing statute itself, “[u]nder no circumstances may resentencing under this section\n\nresult in the imposition of a term longer than the original sentence.” (§ 1170.18, subd.\n\n(e).) The resentencing does not violate the constitutional guarantee against sentence\n\nincreases without a jury’s finding. (People v. Bradford (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1322,\n\n1336.) Because there was no possibility that defendant could receive a sentence greater\n\nthan he already received, the proper standard of proof was preponderance of the\n\nevidence: “[It] is the general rule in California that once a defendant is eligible for an\n\nincreased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its discretion to impose that penalty, may\n\nrely on factors established by a preponderance of the evidence. (In re Coley (2012) 55\n\nCal.4th 524, 557.) As dangerousness is such a factor, preponderance of the evidence is\n\nthe appropriate standard.” (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th\n\n1279, 1305 (Kaulick).)\n\n       In Kaulick, the court held the prosecution’s burden is to establish dangerousness\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, and not by proof beyond a reasonable doubt: “[A]\n\ncourt’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in his favor can be based\n\non any . . . appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and such factor need not be\n\nestablished by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Kaulick, supra, 215\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1303.) The United States Supreme Court has held that most factors\n\nused to increase penalty must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable\n\n                                              8\n\fdoubt, but in the context of Proposition 36 (and Proposition 47), “dangerousness is not a\n\nfactor which enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is resentenced under the\n\nAct; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to\n\nbe resentenced at all. If the court finds that resentencing a prisoner would pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger, the court does not resentence the prisoner, and the petitioner\n\nsimply finishes out the term to which he or she was originally sentenced.” (Kaulick, at p.\n\n1303.) Any facts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate the\n\nSixth Amendment. (Id. at pp. 1304-1305.) The trial court, in exercising its discretion,\n\nmay rely on factors establishing the defendant’s dangerousness based on a preponderance\n\nof the evidence. (Id. at p. 1305.)\n\n       Defendant argues the reasoning of Kaulick should not apply to Proposition 47\n\ndeterminations, because section 1170.18 involves an entirely different judicial\n\nmechanism than does section 1170.126 in that section 1170.18 changes the classification\n\nof the crimes, whereas section 1170.126 permits the reduction of third strikes to second\n\nstrikes. Nevertheless, both statutes require the continued imprisonment of an inmate for a\n\ncrime that would no longer require lengthy imprisonment if the inmate were sentenced\n\ntoday. This is permissible because the petitioning inmate may obtain rensentencing if he\n\nsatisfies the necessary conditions of sections 1170.126 or 1170.18. There is no legal\n\njustification for requiring a disqualifying factor under section 1170.18 to be proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fB. Propositions 36 and 47 and the Meaning of Dangerousness\n\n1. Proposition 36, the Reform Act\n\n       Under the Reform Act, a life sentence for a third strike offender is reserved for\n\ncases where the new felony is also serious or violent. (People v. Yearwood (2013) 213\n\nCal.App.4th 161, 167-168.) In all other cases, the recidivist will now be sentenced as a\n\nsecond strike offender. (Id. at p. 168; see §§ 667, 1170.12.)\n\n       The Reform Act also created a procedure for “persons presently serving an\n\nindeterminate term of imprisonment” to petition for recall of the sentence and for\n\nresentencing as a second striker, when the third strike offense is not a serious or violent\n\nfelony. (See § 1170.126, subds. (a), (b).) Once a prisoner has met the requirements for\n\neligibility for resentencing under section 1170.126, subdivision (e), the prisoner “shall be\n\nresentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the\n\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.I26,\n\nsubd. (f).) Subdivision (g) describes the facts the court may consider: “(1) The\n\npetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the\n\nextent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of\n\nthe crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner's disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\n\nincarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to\n\nbe relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f2. The Safe Act\n\n       The Safe Act, just like the Reform Act, created a procedure for inmates to petition\n\nfor recall of the sentence and for resentencing as a misdemeanant if their felony\n\nconviction would have been a misdemeanor under the new law. (See § 1170.18, subd.\n\n(a).) Once an inmate has met the requirements for eligibility for resentencing under\n\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (a), the prisoner’s felony sentence “shall be recalled and the\n\npetitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines\n\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b).) In “exercising its discretion,” the court considers the\n\nsame factors as set forth in section 1170.126, subdivision (g).\n\n       Although section 1170.126 did not define the meaning of “unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety,” section 1170.18, subdivision (c), defines the phrase to mean “an\n\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\n\nof” Penal Code section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv). (§ 1170.18, subd. (c).) Section\n\n667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv), enumerates several serious or violent felony convictions\n\nthat are commonly referred to as “super strikes,” and include, among other things,\n\nsexually violent offenses, any homicide offense, and “any serious and/or violent felony\n\noffense punishable in California by life imprisonment or death.”\n\nC. The Hearing on Defendant’s Petition Under Section 1170.126\n\n       At the hearing on December 17, 2014, the prosecution introduced into evidence a\n\ncopy of defendant’s prison history, a certified copy of his criminal history, and a packet\n\n                                             11\n\fof police reports. Defendant submitted letters of support from his family and friends and\n\na packet of educational certificates and other certificates of recognition, as well as\n\nmedical documents.\n\n1. Criminal History\n\n       Defendant’s criminal history began in 1965 when he was 14 years old. From 1965\n\nuntil 1979, he had a record of about 40 criminal incidents. In July 1979, he was arrested\n\nfor raping a woman in a public bathroom. He agreed to a negotiated plea to one count of\n\nassault with a deadly weapon, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Four more\n\nincidents occurred in 1979 and 1980. In March 1981, defendant was arrested for raping a\n\nwoman whom he forced into an alley while she was waiting for a bus. He later\n\nthreatened to kill her and her husband if she told anyone. In May 1981, defendant was\n\narrested for armed robbery and eventually sentenced to five years in prison. More\n\nincidents followed in 1983, including when defendant was arrested for shooting the\n\nowner of a bar as he fled through the rear exit of the bar. In 1987, defendant reportedly\n\nforced a woman to copulate him orally, then kicked and punched her in the face, chest,\n\nand back, causing her to sustain a broken nose, broken jawbone, swelling, and bruising.\n\n       In June 1990, defendant was arrested after he repeatedly beat his 12-year-old son\n\nwith a belt while yelling “I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!” In August 1990, police were\n\ndispatched to investigate an attempted rape. The victim told officers that she was with\n\ndefendant and his wife at their apartment when defendant grabbed her by the neck from\n\nbehind, knocked her to the ground, struck her several times, and tried to remove her\n\n                                             12\n\fblouse before she fled. Defendant admitted using force but he and his wife claimed it\n\nwas to throw the victim out of their home.\n\n       Between 1990 and 1997, defendant was involved in multiple incidents—including\n\nassault, battery, and domestic violence—resulting in contact with the Hemet Police\n\nDepartment. In 1992, defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance\n\nand sentenced to one year in jail. In December 1993, defendant was convicted of willful\n\ninfliction of corporal injury of his girlfriend and sentenced to 90 days in jail after he\n\nchoked her, dragged her around the apartment by her neck, and held a butcher knife to\n\nher throat. During the police investigation, defendant kicked the back window out of the\n\npolice car and bent the door frame. In August 1996, defendant was investigated for\n\nharassing two girls on multiple occasions and attempting to lure them into his car.\n\nFinally, in 1998, he was sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence for the instant\n\noffense.\n\n2. Prison History\n\n       In prison, defendant was cited repeatedly for rules violations between 2000 and\n\n2009. In 2000, defendant refused to sign for an envelope and punched his cellmate in the\n\nmouth. In 2001, defendant was argumentative and disruptive during class. Defendant\n\nalso refused to obey the orders of prison staff and return to his seat until additional staff\n\nforced him to comply. Defendant disobeyed direct orders and later refused to participate\n\nin the mandatory standing count. Defendant was involved in a fight with two other\n\ninmates and tried to strike one inmate when he attempted to comply with orders. The\n\n                                              13\n\fofficer used pepper spray against defendant who was uninjured. The other inmate\n\nsustained several injuries.\n\n       In 2002, defendant disobeyed prison staff’s orders and repeatedly appeared outside\n\nof a classroom, leering at a female instructor, which made the instructor “uncomfortable\n\nand concerned for [her] safety.” In 2004, defendant failed to report to his assignment\n\nafter a yard recall and delayed lockup, later becoming belligerent and argumentative after\n\nrefusing to participate in a class assignment.\n\n       In 2005, defendant disobeyed prison staff when requested to move away from a\n\ncell door, telling the prison guard, “Fuck you.” “You stupid Motherfucker!” “Quit being\n\na Bitch!” Defendant was disrespectful of the prison staff and cited for growing a beard in\n\nviolation of grooming standards.\n\n       In 2006, he became argumentative and upset when he was told to return to his\n\nassigned housing unit. In 2007, defendant insulted an inmate of another race and was\n\nthreatened by a group of inmates. Defendant was placed in administrative segregation\n\nafter he was found to present an immediate threat to the safety of himself or others and a\n\ndanger to institution security.\n\n       In 2008, defendant refused to be housed with a known Crip gang member.\n\nDefendant refused to follow emergency procedures by entering his assigned class room\n\nduring an active alarm. In 2009, defendant obstructed the view of his bed with a sheet in\n\nviolation of the rules, and later refused to stand during a mandatory count.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f3. The Trial Court’s Ruling\n\n       At the hearing, the trial court commented that defendant’s criminal history was\n\nextensive and voluminous, and that he had a continuous string of arrests and convictions\n\nuntil he was sentenced to life in prison in 1998. The court observed there was a common\n\ntheme of weapons and of violence against women. Many of defendant’s arrests were\n\nnegotiated into lesser convictions for disposition. Defendant’s history included “1085ls;\n\n245s; burglaries; auto theft; theft from person; 415s; DUIs; knives; guns; bats; 245\n\nkidnapping charges; 245 rape charges; 211 DUI; 211 245; 415; 148s; both resisting and\n\nfalse ID; 288 arrests; drug arrests; domestic violence arrests . . . [and] there’s more with\n\nhis family, his wife; knives; vandalisms . . . there seems to be a common thread\n\nthroughout his life that makes him a risk of being dangerous.” Additionally, the trial\n\ncourt counted 27 incidents in prison\n\n       Defendant argued that he had earned various certificates of achievement while in\n\nprison, including an office services program certificate in 2002; a similar certificate in\n\n2003; a typing course certificate in 2003; an office procedures program certificate and a\n\nbusiness life industry program certificate in 2004; a word processing course certificate in\n\n2005; a school-to-work program certificate, a math-and-literacy course certificate, and an\n\nadult base education program certificate in 2009; a softball league championship award\n\ncertificate in 2010; a work ethic award in 2011; a certificate of recognition for being an\n\numpire in softball in 2011 and 2012; a literacy class certificate in 2012; an office\n\nprocedures certificate in 2014; a GED course completion, a computer literacy class, and a\n\n                                             15\n\fWindows Office certificate in 2014. Defendant also cited his medical records, and told\n\nthe court that he wears a brace on his back and walks with a cane due to “hypertrophic\n\nspurring.” The trial court noted defendant’s condition appeared to be arthritis.\n\n          Defendant denied that he had ever beaten his children—except hitting his son\n\nusing a belt with a metal buckle. Defendant tried to explain his background and his past\n\nbehavior and how he had changed. Upon release, defendant planned to live with his\n\nmother in Inglewood and preferred to enroll in a reentry supervision program. He had\n\nfocused on computer literacy courses in prison.\n\n          The court denied defendant’s petition. Defendant contends the trial court abused\n\nits discretion by determining that he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n          Defendant challenges the court’s reliance on some hearsay evidence. However,\n\ndefendant also admits his 1979 conviction for rape, his 1981 robbery conviction, his 1983\n\nand 1987 convictions for assault, his 1993 domestic violence misdemeanor, and his 1997\n\nconviction for drug possession. Therefore, the trial court did not rely solely upon “mere\n\nuncorroborated hearsay” evidence. (Dyer v Watson (1953) 121 Cal.App.2d 84, 92.)\n\n          Instead, we hold substantial evidence amply supported the trial court’s finding of\n\ndangerousness. (People v. Cluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998.) The trial court\n\nconsidered defendant’s “criminal history, disciplinary record while incarcerated, and . . .\n\nother relevant evidence,” to determine whether he posed “‘an unreasonable risk of danger\n\n                                               16\n\fto public safety.’ (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).)” (People v. Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 176.) Defendant was a career criminal with a history of predatory and violent\n\nbehavior and drug use. In prison, he continued to be antisocial, uncooperative, and\n\naggressive. A preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court’s finding that he\n\nposed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Even accounting for the mitigating\n\nfactors, the trial court did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner when it determined\n\nthat defendant’s criminal and prison history outweighed any mitigating evidence and\n\nproperly exercised its discretion to deny defendant’s petition.\n\nD. The Hearing on Defendant’s Petition Under Section 1170.18\n\n       At the section 1170.18 petition hearing on March 12 and 13, 2015, the parties\n\nsubmitted much of the same evidence presented at the December 2014 hearing under\n\nsection 1170.126. The prosecutor provided evidence of defendant’s criminal and prison\n\nhistory, and documents and police reports of various charged and uncharged crimes.\n\nDefendant again submitted letters of family support, medical records, and certificates of\n\ncourse completion and recognition.\n\n       The victim testified about defendant’s 1979 rape offense. She was on her lunch\n\nbreak in a park near where she worked when defendant called her into a women’s\n\nrestroom. He blocked her exit, pulled out a hunting knife, and warned her, “‘Don’t\n\nscream or anything like that, or I’ll kill you.’” He removed her clothes and raped her.\n\n       Another person testified about a New Year’s Eve party in 1983. The witness was\n\nthe owner of a Los Angeles nightclub. When defendant grabbed the arm of a woman and\n\n                                             17\n\fpulled her away from her dance partner, the two men began yelling and pushing each\n\nother. Defendant wielded a small knife. The nightclub owner grabbed his baseball bat\n\nand told defendant to get out. They fought until the owner’s .45-caliber handgun slipped\n\nout of his holster and defendant retrieved it. As the owner fled into the alley, defendant\n\nfired the owner’s gun twice and struck him in the upper thigh.\n\n       Defendant also testified at the hearing that he has a lumbar spine injury requiring\n\npain medicine. Defendant wore a back brace to the hearing and explained that he\n\noccasionally needs a wheelchair. Defendant testified that he took computer classes in\n\nprison to increase his employment prospects upon release. He disputed the 1979 rape and\n\nclaimed it was consensual but the victim was angry because he did not pay her.\n\n       The trial court explained that it read all of the “voluminous” exhibits before the\n\nhearing, including the exhibits from the December 2014 hearing. The court observed that\n\nfrom 1965 until his life sentence in 1998, defendant continued to commit violent crime\n\n“except when he was incarcerated.” Within a year of defendant being released from\n\nincarceration, he harassed two teenage girls, attempting to get them into his car. The\n\ncourt found defendant was not credible when he discussed the rape incident. The court\n\ncommented that defendant’s numerous prison incident reports were “excessive.”\n\nDefendant also lied about his affiliation with the Bloods gang when he entered prison in\n\n1998. The court observed that the medical evidence did not show defendant was wholly\n\ndisabled. The court acknowledged the mitigating factors: defendant’s age, his mild\n\ndisability, his computer classes and GED, and the years he has already served for a minor\n\n                                             18\n\fconviction after the appellate court dismissed the underlying violent assault.\n\n       The court again recognized that from 1965, when defendant was 14, he\n\ncontinuously committed violent crimes except for when he was incarcerated. His crimes\n\ninvolved “deadly weapons, guns, knives . . . [and] [a]s far as the victims are concerned,\n\nthey were shot, beaten, raped, psychological injuries, fractures.” Even if no conviction\n\nresulted, defendant’s crimes were “the super strike type of crimes . . . [r]ape, attempted\n\nmurder, kidnapping, and most involved violence against women. . . .” In prison, he had\n\nmany incident reports.\n\n       The court ruled that releasing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk that he\n\nwould commit a new violent crime, including a “sexually violent crime, maybe a murder\n\nor attempted murder, or a molestation of someone under the age of 18.” Because\n\ndefendant had three prior strikes, he might commit a serious or violent felony offense that\n\nwould result in a life sentence.\n\nE. The “Unreasonable Risk of Danger” Standard as Defined in Section 1170.18\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court misinterpreted the meaning of “unreasonable risk\n\nof danger,” as defined by 1170.18, subdivision (c), by evaluating whether he had the\n\npotential to commit an additional serious or violent felony offense, which would result in\n\na life sentence because he is a second strike offender. Defendant also contends the court\n\nerroneously believed that the misdemeanor offense of molesting a child under the age of\n\n18 could disqualify him from resentencing.\n\n       Defendant has failed to rebut the presumption that the trial court understood the\n\n                                             19\n\frelevant law and appropriately applied it. Contrary to defendant’s contentions, the court\n\nproperly evaluated whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety. Under section 1170.18, subdivision (c), “unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety” means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony\n\nwithin the meaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv). (§ 1170.18, subd. (c).)\n\nAmong other so-called “super strikes,” which include several sexually violent or\n\negregious offenses, that subsection includes “[a]ny serious and/or violent felony offense\n\npunishable in California by life imprisonment or death.” (§ 667, subd.\n\n(e)(2)(C)(iv)(VIII).)2\n\n       Defendant has three strike priors. (People v. Martin, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.\n\n1183-1184.) Therefore any commission of another serious or violent felony offense\n\nwould result in a life sentence under the terms of the Three Strikes Law. (§ 667, subd.\n\n(e)(2)(A).) For the purposes of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv)(VIII), any serious\n\nor violent felony offense committed by a second strike offender would result in a life\n\nsentence. Because defendant has three strike priors, the trial court correctly considered\n\nthe likelihood to reoffend because defendant has three strike priors, and any future\n\nserious or violent felony conviction would result in a life sentence.\n\n\n       2 We note that the California Supreme Court has granted a hearing in almost\nevery published appellate case which addresses “dangerousness,” beginning with People\nv. Valencia (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 514, and ending most recently with People v.\nDelapena (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1414.\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       Defendant protests that this interpretation would mean that a defendant with two\n\nstrikes who commits a third felony which is neither violent nor serious would never be\n\nable to avail himself of resentencing. However, an inmate’s propensity to commit an\n\nadditional felony that is neither violent nor serious would not be sufficient to disqualify\n\nhim from resentencing under section 1170.18. Only the inmate’s propensity to commit\n\nanother serious or violent felony as defined by sections 667.5, subdivision (c), and\n\n1192.7, subdivision (c), would be relevant to determining dangerousness under section\n\n1170.18. The likelihood that an inmate with two strike priors would commit any other\n\nnonserious or nonviolent felony would be irrelevant to the dangerousness determination\n\nunder section 1170.18.\n\n       Furthermore, defendant misrepresents the trial court’s comments when he argues\n\nthe trial court determined he posed a risk of dangerousness because he may have had a\n\npropensity to commit the misdemeanor offense of molesting a child. (§ 647.6, subd.\n\n(a)(1).) What the trial court actually said was, even though defendant is “in custody on a\n\nminor crime, and he’s already served 18 years, that there is an unreasonable risk that he\n\nwill commit a new violent crime under 1170.18(a) and 667(c) (e) (4) [sic], that is a\n\nsexually violent crime, maybe a murder or attempt murder, or a molestation of someone\n\nunder the age of 18.” The court did not mention misdemeanor child molestation.\n\n       “The general rule is that a trial court is presumed to have been aware of, and\n\nfollowed the applicable law.” (People v. Mosley (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 489, 496, citing\n\nHoward v. Thrifty Drug & Discount Stores (1995) 10 Cal.4th 424, 443; Evid. Code, §\n\n                                             21\n\f664.) The reviewing court presumes the trial court’s decision is correct. (Mosley, at p.\n\n496.) An order is presumed correct and error must be affirmatively shown. (Ibid.) The\n\nappellate court cannot presume error where the record does not establish on its face that\n\nthe trial court misunderstood the scope of its discretion. (See People v. White Eagle\n\n(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1511, 1521-1523; People v. Davis (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 168,\n\n170-173.) Here, the record does not establish on its face that the court believed it could\n\ndeny defendant’s petition if it found that defendant had the propensity to commit any\n\nmisdemeanor. Absent any indication to the contrary, defendant has not rebutted the\n\npresumption that the trial court understood and followed the relevant law in determining\n\nwhether he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (Mosley, at p. 496.)\n\n       Just like with the section 1170.126 petition, the evidence amply supported the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that defendant continued to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.\n\nDefendant did not establish he has been rehabilitated. From age 14 in 1965 until his life\n\nsentence in 1998, defendant continuously committed violent crimes except for when he\n\nwas incarcerated. Many of defendant’s crimes were serious and violent, “the super strike\n\ntype of crimes . . . [r]ape, attempted murder, kidnapping, and most involved violence\n\nagainst women, whether it was his wife or women that he picked up off the streets.” The\n\nnumerous prison incidents were “excessive.” Defendant still refuses to accept culpability\n\nfor the 1979 rape conviction.\n\n       The trial court’s determination was hardly so irrational or arbitrary that no\n\nreasonable person could agree with it. Defendant exhibited little remorse and accepted\n\n                                             22\n\fno responsibility for his crimes. Considering all the evidence of defendant’s violent\n\ncriminal history, his lengthy disciplinary history in prison, and his failure to accept\n\nculpability, the trial court unquestionably properly exercised its discretion to deny\n\ndefendant’s section 1170.18 petition. Even without considering defendant’s propensity to\n\ncommit serious or violent felony offenses, the evidence presented at the petition hearing\n\noverwhelmingly demonstrated that he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety within the meaning of section 1170.18.\n\n                                             IV\n\n                                       DISPOSTIION\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s section 1170.126\n\nand 1170.18 petitions. It properly analyzed defendant’s potential for dangerousness.\n\n       We affirm the judgment.\n\n       NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n                                                                 CODRINGTON\n                                                                                            J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\nRAMIREZ\n                        P.

He has been incarcerated since 1998 for felony possession of .12 grams of\n\nmethamphetamine. He turned 65 years old in January 2016.\n\n       After the passage of Proposition 36 and Proposition 47, defendant filed separate\n\npetitions under Penal Code sections 1170.126 and 1170.181 for recall of his indeterminate\n\nsentence of 26 years to life. Defendant argues the trial court erred when it found\n\ndefendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied both\n\npetitions. (§§ 1170.126, subds. (f) and (g), 1170.18, subd. (b).) As to the first petition,\n\nhe contends the trial court abused its discretion. As to the second petition, he argues\n\ndangerousness must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court employed\n\nthe wrong criteria for evaluating dangerousness.\n\n       Our review of the record concludes that a preponderance of the evidence amply\n\nsupported the trial court’s exercise of its discretion. It is unnecessary to prove\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Absent any statutory indication, the burden of\n\nproof is by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial\n\ncourt’s determination was not irrational or arbitrary according to the standard of a\n\nreasonable person. Defendant’s criminal and prison history demonstrates that he has not\n\n       1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fbeen rehabilitated. Furthermore, defendant has not rebutted the presumption that the trial\n\ncourt appropriately applied the relevant law. We affirm the judgment.\n\n                                             II\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n\nA. Defendant’s 1998 Commitment Offense and Initial Appeal\n\n       Defendant’s 1998 commitment offense involved possession of .12 grams of\n\nmethamphetamine. In 1997, defendant was involved in an altercation with his family\n\nmembers and neighbors. Beforehand, another of the people involved gave him the\n\nmethamphetamine and asked him to dispose of it. (People v. Martin (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2587461\"><a href=\"/opinion/2587461/people-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1182-1183.) “Ultimately, defendant wound up outside in the alley behind the\n\nhouse, facing a group of adults, [composed] of family members and neighbors[,] as he\n\nscreamed and swung a metal pipe around himself in an arc, as one would swing a\n\nbaseball bat. Defendant also picked up and threw rocks at the group, hitting a neighbor,\n\nNaomi Biggs, in the leg. Nicole Trip testified that as she tried to go past defendant to\n\nenter the house to call police, [] defendant stepped in her direction and took a ‘full swing’\n\nat her with the pipe. She ‘jump[ed] back’ and the pipe missed her by three or four feet.\n\nDefendant did not actually hit anyone with the pipe during the episode.” (Id. at p. 1183.)\n\nAfter police arrested defendant, they searched his pants pockets and discovered a ‘bindle’\n\ncontaining .12 grams of methamphetamine. He claimed the drug was not his. (Ibid.)\n\n       A jury convicted defendant of three offenses: felony assault with a deadly weapon\n\n(§ 245, subd. (a)(l) [swinging the pipe at victim Nicole Trip]); possession of\n\n                                              3\n\fmethamphetamine (Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)); and misdemeanor battery\n\n(§ 242 [(hitting Naomi Biggs with rocks)].) The court found true the enhancement\n\nallegations that defendant had not remained free of convictions for five years after\n\nserving a prison term (§ 667.5, subd. (b)) and had previously been convicted of three\n\nserious and violent felonies. (§§ 667, subds. (c) & (e), 1170.12, subd. (c); People v.\n\nMartin, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 1183-1184.)\n\n       At sentencing on December 19, 1998, the court expressly declined to exercise its\n\ndiscretion under section 1385 to strike any of the prior convictions. Defendant was\n\nsentenced to two concurrent prison terms of 25 years to life for both of the felony\n\nconvictions; one concurrent term of six months in county jail for the misdemeanor battery\n\nconviction; and a one-year consecutive prison term for not having remained free of\n\nimprisonment or felony convictions for five years. (People v. Martin, supra, 25 Cal.4th\n\nat p. 1184.)\n\n       After this court reversed defendant’s conviction of assault with a deadly weapon\n\nfor insufficiency of evidence and vacated the 25-year-to-life indeterminate term for that\n\noffense, the California Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. (People v. Martin, supra,\n\n25 Cal.4th at pp. 1184, 1193.) Consequently, defendant is serving a sentence of 26 years\n\nto life based on his felony conviction for possession of .12 grams of methamphetamine.\n\nDefendant has now been incarcerated for about 17 years.\n\nB. The Denial of Defendant’s Section 1170.126 Petition\n\n       After passage of Proposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the\n\n                                             4\n\fReform Act), section 1170.126 provides a resentencing option to “persons presently\n\nserving an indeterminate term of imprisonment pursuant to” the Three Strikes Law.\n\n(Reform Act, § 6.)\n\n         On December 3, 2012, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence. On May\n\n31, 2013, the trial court determined that he was eligible to petition for recall but denied\n\nhis petition on the grounds that he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\nDefendant appealed, and this court reversed the judgment in an unpublished opinion, on\n\nthe grounds that defendant was denied his constitutional and statutory rights by not\n\nreceiving an opportunity to appear personally at the dangerousness hearing, and that he\n\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to communicate with\n\nhim before the hearing. (People v. Martin (July 21, 2014, E058888) [nonpub. opn.] at pp.\n\n9-10.)\n\n         On remand, defendant personally appeared at the second petition hearing on\n\nDecember 17, 2014. The trial court again determined that defendant posed an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied his petition. Defendant filed a\n\nnotice of appeal challenging the second denial of his section 1170.126 petition.\n\nC. Defendant’s Petition for Recall of Sentence Filed Under Section 1170.18\n\n         In November 2014, the enactment of Proposition 47, The Safe Neighborhoods and\n\nSchools Act (the Safe Act), mandated “misdemeanors instead of felonies for nonserious,\n\nnonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant has prior\n\nconvictions for specified violent or serious crimes.” (Safe Act, § 3, subd. (3).) In\n\n                                              5\n\faddition, the Safe Act authorized “consideration of resentencing for anyone who is\n\ncurrently serving a sentence for any of the offenses listed herein that are now\n\nmisdemeanors.” (Safe Act, § 3, subd. (4).) The Safe Act added section 1170.18 (Safe\n\nAct, § 14), which provides a resentencing option to “person[s] currently serving a\n\nsentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would\n\nhave been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (‘this act’) had\n\nthis act been in effect at the time of the offense . . . .” (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).)\n\n       Defendant filed a petition for resentencing under section 1170.18 to convert his\n\nfelony conviction for possession to a misdemeanor. On March 13, 2015, the trial court\n\ndenied his petition on the grounds that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety. Defendant filed a notice of appeal challenging the denial of his section\n\n1170.18 petition.\n\n                                               III\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n       Defendant claims the trial court erred by determining that he poses an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety under sections 1170.126 and 1170.18. He\n\nspecifically argues that his criminal history and prison records do not demonstrate that he\n\ncurrently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to the public. However, the evidence of\n\ndefendant’s behavior, both in and out of custody, supports the trial court’s dangerousness\n\ndetermination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fA. Standard of Review\n\n       In his opening brief, defendant concedes the relevant standard of review applied to\n\na ruling of dangerousness on a section 1170.126 petition is abuse of discretion. However,\n\nin his supplemental opening brief, defendant argues the court’s dangerousness\n\ndetermination on a section 1170.18 petition must be based on a finding beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, rather than by a preponderance of the evidence. We hold both petitions\n\nare subject to review for abuse of discretion.\n\n       In Sentencing California Crimes, the authors describe the standard of review for\n\nsection 1170.126 and section 1170.18 petitions. The denial of resentencing based on\n\ndangerousness is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. The plain language of both section\n\n1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g), and section 1170.18, subdivision (b), calls for an\n\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion: “‘Discretion is the power to make the\n\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521321\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521321/people-v-carmony/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\n\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\n\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\n\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\n\nRodrigues (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124-1125; see People v.

According to the\n\nresentencing statute itself, “[u]nder no circumstances may resentencing under this section\n\nresult in the imposition of a term longer than the original sentence.” (§ 1170.18, subd.\n\n(e).) The resentencing does not violate the constitutional guarantee against sentence\n\nincreases without a jury’s finding. (People v. Bradford (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1336.) Because there was no possibility that defendant could receive a sentence greater\n\nthan he already received, the proper standard of proof was preponderance of the\n\nevidence: “[It] is the general rule in California that once a defendant is eligible for an\n\nincreased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its discretion to impose that penalty, may\n\nrely on factors established by a preponderance of the evidence. (In re Coley (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557.) As dangerousness is such a factor, preponderance of the evidence is\n\nthe appropriate standard.” (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1305 (Kaulick).)\n\n       In Kaulick, the court held the prosecution’s burden is to establish dangerousness\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence, and not by proof beyond a reasonable doubt: “[A]\n\ncourt’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in his favor can be based\n\non any . . . appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and such factor need not be\n\nestablished by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Kaulick, supra, 215\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1303.) The United States Supreme Court has held that most factors\n\nused to increase penalty must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable\n\n                                              8\n\fdoubt, but in the context of Proposition 36 (and Proposition 47), “dangerousness is not a\n\nfactor which enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is resentenced under the\n\nAct; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to\n\nbe resentenced at all. If the court finds that resentencing a prisoner would pose an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger, the court does not resentence the prisoner, and the petitioner\n\nsimply finishes out the term to which he or she was originally sentenced.” (Kaulick, at p.\n\n1303.) Any facts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate the\n\nSixth Amendment. (Id. at pp. 1304-1305.) The trial court, in exercising its discretion,\n\nmay rely on factors establishing the defendant’s dangerousness based on a preponderance\n\nof the evidence. (Id. at p. 1305.)\n\n       Defendant argues the reasoning of Kaulick should not apply to Proposition 47\n\ndeterminations, because section 1170.18 involves an entirely different judicial\n\nmechanism than does section 1170.126 in that section 1170.18 changes the classification\n\nof the crimes, whereas section 1170.126 permits the reduction of third strikes to second\n\nstrikes. Nevertheless, both statutes require the continued imprisonment of an inmate for a\n\ncrime that would no longer require lengthy imprisonment if the inmate were sentenced\n\ntoday. This is permissible because the petitioning inmate may obtain rensentencing if he\n\nsatisfies the necessary conditions of sections 1170.126 or 1170.18. There is no legal\n\njustification for requiring a disqualifying factor under section 1170.18 to be proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fB. Propositions 36 and 47 and the Meaning of Dangerousness\n\n1. Proposition 36, the Reform Act\n\n       Under the Reform Act, a life sentence for a third strike offender is reserved for\n\ncases where the new felony is also serious or violent. (People v. Yearwood (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167-168.) In all other cases, the recidivist will now be sentenced as a\n\nsecond strike offender. (Id. at p. 168; see §§ 667, 1170.12.)\n\n       The Reform Act also created a procedure for “persons presently serving an\n\nindeterminate term of imprisonment” to petition for recall of the sentence and for\n\nresentencing as a second striker, when the third strike offense is not a serious or violent\n\nfelony. (See § 1170.126, subds. (a), (b).) Once a prisoner has met the requirements for\n\neligibility for resentencing under section 1170.126, subdivision (e), the prisoner “shall be\n\nresentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the\n\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.I26,\n\nsubd. (f).) Subdivision (g) describes the facts the court may consider: “(1) The\n\npetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the\n\nextent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of\n\nthe crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner's disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\n\nincarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to\n\nbe relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f2. The Safe Act\n\n       The Safe Act, just like the Reform Act, created a procedure for inmates to petition\n\nfor recall of the sentence and for resentencing as a misdemeanant if their felony\n\nconviction would have been a misdemeanor under the new law. (See § 1170.18, subd.\n\n(a).) Once an inmate has met the requirements for eligibility for resentencing under\n\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (a), the prisoner’s felony sentence “shall be recalled and the\n\npetitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines\n\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b).) In “exercising its discretion,” the court considers the\n\nsame factors as set forth in section 1170.126, subdivision (g).\n\n       Although section 1170.126 did not define the meaning of “unreasonable risk of\n\ndanger to public safety,” section 1170.18, subdivision (c), defines the phrase to mean “an\n\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\n\nof” Penal Code section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv). (§ 1170.18, subd. (c).) Section\n\n667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv), enumerates several serious or violent felony convictions\n\nthat are commonly referred to as “super strikes,” and include, among other things,\n\nsexually violent offenses, any homicide offense, and “any serious and/or violent felony\n\noffense punishable in California by life imprisonment or death.”\n\nC. The Hearing on Defendant’s Petition Under Section 1170.126\n\n       At the hearing on December 17, 2014, the prosecution introduced into evidence a\n\ncopy of defendant’s prison history, a certified copy of his criminal history, and a packet\n\n                                             11\n\fof police reports. Defendant submitted letters of support from his family and friends and\n\na packet of educational certificates and other certificates of recognition, as well as\n\nmedical documents.\n\n1. Criminal History\n\n       Defendant’s criminal history began in 1965 when he was 14 years old. From 1965\n\nuntil 1979, he had a record of about 40 criminal incidents. In July 1979, he was arrested\n\nfor raping a woman in a public bathroom. He agreed to a negotiated plea to one count of\n\nassault with a deadly weapon, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Four more\n\nincidents occurred in 1979 and 1980. In March 1981, defendant was arrested for raping a\n\nwoman whom he forced into an alley while she was waiting for a bus. He later\n\nthreatened to kill her and her husband if she told anyone. In May 1981, defendant was\n\narrested for armed robbery and eventually sentenced to five years in prison. More\n\nincidents followed in 1983, including when defendant was arrested for shooting the\n\nowner of a bar as he fled through the rear exit of the bar. In 1987, defendant reportedly\n\nforced a woman to copulate him orally, then kicked and punched her in the face, chest,\n\nand back, causing her to sustain a broken nose, broken jawbone, swelling, and bruising.\n\n       In June 1990, defendant was arrested after he repeatedly beat his 12-year-old son\n\nwith a belt while yelling “I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!” In August 1990, police were\n\ndispatched to investigate an attempted rape. The victim told officers that she was with\n\ndefendant and his wife at their apartment when defendant grabbed her by the neck from\n\nbehind, knocked her to the ground, struck her several times, and tried to remove her\n\n                                             12\n\fblouse before she fled. Defendant admitted using force but he and his wife claimed it\n\nwas to throw the victim out of their home.\n\n       Between 1990 and 1997, defendant was involved in multiple incidents—including\n\nassault, battery, and domestic violence—resulting in contact with the Hemet Police\n\nDepartment. In 1992, defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance\n\nand sentenced to one year in jail. In December 1993, defendant was convicted of willful\n\ninfliction of corporal injury of his girlfriend and sentenced to 90 days in jail after he\n\nchoked her, dragged her around the apartment by her neck, and held a butcher knife to\n\nher throat. During the police investigation, defendant kicked the back window out of the\n\npolice car and bent the door frame. In August 1996, defendant was investigated for\n\nharassing two girls on multiple occasions and attempting to lure them into his car.\n\nFinally, in 1998, he was sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence for the instant\n\noffense.\n\n2. Prison History\n\n       In prison, defendant was cited repeatedly for rules violations between 2000 and\n\n2009. In 2000, defendant refused to sign for an envelope and punched his cellmate in the\n\nmouth. In 2001, defendant was argumentative and disruptive during class. Defendant\n\nalso refused to obey the orders of prison staff and return to his seat until additional staff\n\nforced him to comply. Defendant disobeyed direct orders and later refused to participate\n\nin the mandatory standing count. Defendant was involved in a fight with two other\n\ninmates and tried to strike one inmate when he attempted to comply with orders. The\n\n                                              13\n\fofficer used pepper spray against defendant who was uninjured. The other inmate\n\nsustained several injuries.\n\n       In 2002, defendant disobeyed prison staff’s orders and repeatedly appeared outside\n\nof a classroom, leering at a female instructor, which made the instructor “uncomfortable\n\nand concerned for [her] safety.” In 2004, defendant failed to report to his assignment\n\nafter a yard recall and delayed lockup, later becoming belligerent and argumentative after\n\nrefusing to participate in a class assignment.\n\n       In 2005, defendant disobeyed prison staff when requested to move away from a\n\ncell door, telling the prison guard, “Fuck you.” “You stupid Motherfucker!” “Quit being\n\na Bitch!” Defendant was disrespectful of the prison staff and cited for growing a beard in\n\nviolation of grooming standards.\n\n       In 2006, he became argumentative and upset when he was told to return to his\n\nassigned housing unit. In 2007, defendant insulted an inmate of another race and was\n\nthreatened by a group of inmates. Defendant was placed in administrative segregation\n\nafter he was found to present an immediate threat to the safety of himself or others and a\n\ndanger to institution security.\n\n       In 2008, defendant refused to be housed with a known Crip gang member.\n\nDefendant refused to follow emergency procedures by entering his assigned class room\n\nduring an active alarm. In 2009, defendant obstructed the view of his bed with a sheet in\n\nviolation of the rules, and later refused to stand during a mandatory count.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f3. The Trial Court’s Ruling\n\n       At the hearing, the trial court commented that defendant’s criminal history was\n\nextensive and voluminous, and that he had a continuous string of arrests and convictions\n\nuntil he was sentenced to life in prison in 1998. The court observed there was a common\n\ntheme of weapons and of violence against women. Many of defendant’s arrests were\n\nnegotiated into lesser convictions for disposition. Defendant’s history included “1085ls;\n\n245s; burglaries; auto theft; theft from person; 415s; DUIs; knives; guns; bats; 245\n\nkidnapping charges; 245 rape charges; 211 DUI; 211 245; 415; 148s; both resisting and\n\nfalse ID; 288 arrests; drug arrests; domestic violence arrests . . . [and] there’s more with\n\nhis family, his wife; knives; vandalisms . . . there seems to be a common thread\n\nthroughout his life that makes him a risk of being dangerous.” Additionally, the trial\n\ncourt counted 27 incidents in prison\n\n       Defendant argued that he had earned various certificates of achievement while in\n\nprison, including an office services program certificate in 2002; a similar certificate in\n\n2003; a typing course certificate in 2003; an office procedures program certificate and a\n\nbusiness life industry program certificate in 2004; a word processing course certificate in\n\n2005; a school-to-work program certificate, a math-and-literacy course certificate, and an\n\nadult base education program certificate in 2009; a softball league championship award\n\ncertificate in 2010; a work ethic award in 2011; a certificate of recognition for being an\n\numpire in softball in 2011 and 2012; a literacy class certificate in 2012; an office\n\nprocedures certificate in 2014; a GED course completion, a computer literacy class, and a\n\n                                             15\n\fWindows Office certificate in 2014. Defendant also cited his medical records, and told\n\nthe court that he wears a brace on his back and walks with a cane due to “hypertrophic\n\nspurring.” The trial court noted defendant’s condition appeared to be arthritis.\n\n          Defendant denied that he had ever beaten his children—except hitting his son\n\nusing a belt with a metal buckle. Defendant tried to explain his background and his past\n\nbehavior and how he had changed. Upon release, defendant planned to live with his\n\nmother in Inglewood and preferred to enroll in a reentry supervision program. He had\n\nfocused on computer literacy courses in prison.\n\n          The court denied defendant’s petition. Defendant contends the trial court abused\n\nits discretion by determining that he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n          Defendant challenges the court’s reliance on some hearsay evidence. However,\n\ndefendant also admits his 1979 conviction for rape, his 1981 robbery conviction, his 1983\n\nand 1987 convictions for assault, his 1993 domestic violence misdemeanor, and his 1997\n\nconviction for drug possession. Therefore, the trial court did not rely solely upon “mere\n\nuncorroborated hearsay” evidence. (Dyer v Watson (1953) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92.)\n\n          Instead, we hold substantial evidence amply supported the trial court’s finding of\n\ndangerousness. (People v. Cluff (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286872\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286872/people-v-cluff/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998.) The trial court\n\nconsidered defendant’s “criminal history, disciplinary record while incarcerated, and . . .\n\nother relevant evidence,” to determine whether he posed “‘an unreasonable risk of danger\n\n                                               16\n\fto public safety.’ (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).)” (People v. Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 176.) Defendant was a career criminal with a history of predatory and violent\n\nbehavior and drug use. In prison, he continued to be antisocial, uncooperative, and\n\naggressive. A preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court’s finding that he\n\nposed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Even accounting for the mitigating\n\nfactors, the trial court did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner when it determined\n\nthat defendant’s criminal and prison history outweighed any mitigating evidence and\n\nproperly exercised its discretion to deny defendant’s petition.\n\nD. The Hearing on Defendant’s Petition Under Section 1170.18\n\n       At the section 1170.18 petition hearing on March 12 and 13, 2015, the parties\n\nsubmitted much of the same evidence presented at the December 2014 hearing under\n\nsection 1170.126. The prosecutor provided evidence of defendant’s criminal and prison\n\nhistory, and documents and police reports of various charged and uncharged crimes.\n\nDefendant again submitted letters of family support, medical records, and certificates of\n\ncourse completion and recognition.\n\n       The victim testified about defendant’s 1979 rape offense. She was on her lunch\n\nbreak in a park near where she worked when defendant called her into a women’s\n\nrestroom. He blocked her exit, pulled out a hunting knife, and warned her, “‘Don’t\n\nscream or anything like that, or I’ll kill you.’” He removed her clothes and raped her.\n\n       Another person testified about a New Year’s Eve party in 1983. The witness was\n\nthe owner of a Los Angeles nightclub. When defendant grabbed the arm of a woman and\n\n                                             17\n\fpulled her away from her dance partner, the two men began yelling and pushing each\n\nother. Defendant wielded a small knife. The nightclub owner grabbed his baseball bat\n\nand told defendant to get out. They fought until the owner’s .45-caliber handgun slipped\n\nout of his holster and defendant retrieved it. As the owner fled into the alley, defendant\n\nfired the owner’s gun twice and struck him in the upper thigh.\n\n       Defendant also testified at the hearing that he has a lumbar spine injury requiring\n\npain medicine. Defendant wore a back brace to the hearing and explained that he\n\noccasionally needs a wheelchair. Defendant testified that he took computer classes in\n\nprison to increase his employment prospects upon release. He disputed the 1979 rape and\n\nclaimed it was consensual but the victim was angry because he did not pay her.\n\n       The trial court explained that it read all of the “voluminous” exhibits before the\n\nhearing, including the exhibits from the December 2014 hearing. The court observed that\n\nfrom 1965 until his life sentence in 1998, defendant continued to commit violent crime\n\n“except when he was incarcerated.” Within a year of defendant being released from\n\nincarceration, he harassed two teenage girls, attempting to get them into his car. The\n\ncourt found defendant was not credible when he discussed the rape incident. The court\n\ncommented that defendant’s numerous prison incident reports were “excessive.”\n\nDefendant also lied about his affiliation with the Bloods gang when he entered prison in\n\n1998. The court observed that the medical evidence did not show defendant was wholly\n\ndisabled. The court acknowledged the mitigating factors: defendant’s age, his mild\n\ndisability, his computer classes and GED, and the years he has already served for a minor\n\n                                             18\n\fconviction after the appellate court dismissed the underlying violent assault.\n\n       The court again recognized that from 1965, when defendant was 14, he\n\ncontinuously committed violent crimes except for when he was incarcerated. His crimes\n\ninvolved “deadly weapons, guns, knives . . . [and] [a]s far as the victims are concerned,\n\nthey were shot, beaten, raped, psychological injuries, fractures.” Even if no conviction\n\nresulted, defendant’s crimes were “the super strike type of crimes . . . [r]ape, attempted\n\nmurder, kidnapping, and most involved violence against women. . . .” In prison, he had\n\nmany incident reports.\n\n       The court ruled that releasing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk that he\n\nwould commit a new violent crime, including a “sexually violent crime, maybe a murder\n\nor attempted murder, or a molestation of someone under the age of 18.” Because\n\ndefendant had three prior strikes, he might commit a serious or violent felony offense that\n\nwould result in a life sentence.\n\nE. The “Unreasonable Risk of Danger” Standard as Defined in Section 1170.18\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court misinterpreted the meaning of “unreasonable risk\n\nof danger,” as defined by 1170.18, subdivision (c), by evaluating whether he had the\n\npotential to commit an additional serious or violent felony offense, which would result in\n\na life sentence because he is a second strike offender. Defendant also contends the court\n\nerroneously believed that the misdemeanor offense of molesting a child under the age of\n\n18 could disqualify him from resentencing.\n\n       Defendant has failed to rebut the presumption that the trial court understood the\n\n                                             19\n\frelevant law and appropriately applied it. Contrary to defendant’s contentions, the court\n\nproperly evaluated whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety. Under section 1170.18, subdivision (c), “unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety” means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony\n\nwithin the meaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv). (§ 1170.18, subd. (c).)\n\nAmong other so-called “super strikes,” which include several sexually violent or\n\negregious offenses, that subsection includes “[a]ny serious and/or violent felony offense\n\npunishable in California by life imprisonment or death.” (§ 667, subd.\n\n(e)(2)(C)(iv)(VIII).)2\n\n       Defendant has three strike priors. (People v. Martin, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.\n\n1183-1184.) Therefore any commission of another serious or violent felony offense\n\nwould result in a life sentence under the terms of the Three Strikes Law. (§ 667, subd.\n\n(e)(2)(A).) For the purposes of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv)(VIII), any serious\n\nor violent felony offense committed by a second strike offender would result in a life\n\nsentence. Because defendant has three strike priors, the trial court correctly considered\n\nthe likelihood to reoffend because defendant has three strike priors, and any future\n\nserious or violent felony conviction would result in a life sentence.\n\n\n       2 We note that the California Supreme Court has granted a hearing in almost\nevery published appellate case which addresses “dangerousness,” beginning with People\nv.

However, an inmate’s propensity to commit an\n\nadditional felony that is neither violent nor serious would not be sufficient to disqualify\n\nhim from resentencing under section 1170.18. Only the inmate’s propensity to commit\n\nanother serious or violent felony as defined by sections 667.5, subdivision (c), and\n\n1192.7, subdivision (c), would be relevant to determining dangerousness under section\n\n1170.18. The likelihood that an inmate with two strike priors would commit any other\n\nnonserious or nonviolent felony would be irrelevant to the dangerousness determination\n\nunder section 1170.18.\n\n       Furthermore, defendant misrepresents the trial court’s comments when he argues\n\nthe trial court determined he posed a risk of dangerousness because he may have had a\n\npropensity to commit the misdemeanor offense of molesting a child. (§ 647.6, subd.\n\n(a)(1).) What the trial court actually said was, even though defendant is “in custody on a\n\nminor crime, and he’s already served 18 years, that there is an unreasonable risk that he\n\nwill commit a new violent crime under 1170.18(a) and 667(c) (e) (4) [sic], that is a\n\nsexually violent crime, maybe a murder or attempt murder, or a molestation of someone\n\nunder the age of 18.” The court did not mention misdemeanor child molestation.\n\n       “The general rule is that a trial court is presumed to have been aware of, and\n\nfollowed the applicable law.” (People v.

An order is presumed correct and error must be affirmatively shown. (Ibid.) The\n\nappellate court cannot presume error where the record does not establish on its face that\n\nthe trial court misunderstood the scope of its discretion. (See People v.

Here, the record does not establish on its face that the court believed it could\n\ndeny defendant’s petition if it found that defendant had the propensity to commit any\n\nmisdemeanor. Absent any indication to the contrary, defendant has not rebutted the\n\npresumption that the trial court understood and followed the relevant law in determining\n\nwhether he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (Mosley, at p. 496.)\n\n       Just like with the section 1170.126 petition, the evidence amply supported the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that defendant continued to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.\n\nDefendant did not establish he has been rehabilitated. From age 14 in 1965 until his life\n\nsentence in 1998, defendant continuously committed violent crimes except for when he\n\nwas incarcerated. Many of defendant’s crimes were serious and violent, “the super strike\n\ntype of crimes . . . [r]ape, attempted murder, kidnapping, and most involved violence\n\nagainst women, whether it was his wife or women that he picked up off the streets.” The\n\nnumerous prison incidents were “excessive.” Defendant still refuses to accept culpability\n\nfor the 1979 rape conviction.\n\n       The trial court’s determination was hardly so irrational or arbitrary that no\n\nreasonable person could agree with it. Defendant exhibited little remorse and accepted\n\n                                             22\n\fno responsibility for his crimes. Considering all the evidence of defendant’s violent\n\ncriminal history, his lengthy disciplinary history in prison, and his failure to accept\n\nculpability, the trial court unquestionably properly exercised its discretion to deny\n\ndefendant’s section 1170.18 petition. Even without considering defendant’s propensity to\n\ncommit serious or violent felony offenses, the evidence presented at the petition hearing\n\noverwhelmingly demonstrated that he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety within the meaning of section 1170.18.\n\n                                             IV\n\n                                       DISPOSTIION\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s section 1170.126\n\nand 1170.18 petitions. It properly analyzed defendant’s potential for dangerousness.\n\n       We affirm the judgment.\n\n       NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n                                                                 CODRINGTON\n                                                                                            J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\nRAMIREZ\n                        P.
