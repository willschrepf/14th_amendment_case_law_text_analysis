Mot. Summ. J., May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48. Having carefully considered\n\ndefendant’s Motion, plaintiff’s Opposition, defendant’s Reply, the entire record in this\n\ncase, and the applicable law, the Court will grant defendant’s Motion in part and deny it\n\nin part. A review of the background of the case, the governing law, the parties’\n\narguments, and the Court’s reasoning in resolving those arguments follows.\n\n    I. Background\n\n             A. Introduction\n\n        J. Blair Hayes brings this lawsuit against the Secretary of the Department of\n\nHealth and Human Services. 1 Suing under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Hayes\n\nalleges that HHS discriminated against him because of his race and retaliated against him\n\n\n1\n  Hayes originally named Michael O. Leavitt in his official capacity as Secretary of HHS as defendant in\nthis case. Complaint 1, January 25, 2008, ECF No. 1. When Kathleen Sebelius took over as Secretary of\nHHS, she simultaneously became the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).\n\n\n                                                    1\n\ffor bringing a discrimination claim. He contends that HHS (1) denied him a Deputy\n\nDirector position on an acting basis; (2) denied him the same Deputy Director position on\n\na permanent basis; (3) lowered his performance appraisals for 2006; (4) lowered his\n\nperformance appraisals for 2007; (5) placed him on a Performance Improvement Plan in\n\n2008; (6) unfairly monitored his job performance; (7) unfairly criticized his job\n\nperformance; and (8) made him perform job duties outside his position description, all\n\nout of illegal discriminatory and retaliatory animus. He also contends that retaliatory\n\nanimus was a “motivating factor” in HHS’s decision to deny him the Permanent Deputy\n\nDirector position. He argues that even if that illicit motive was not the sole or but-for\n\ncause of HHS’s decision, a reasonable jury could still find HHS liable under Title VII.\n\n       HHS responds that many of Hayes’s allegations are not based on employment\n\nactions severe enough to constitute adverse employment actions (or materially adverse\n\nemployment actions in the retaliation context) for Title VII purposes. It further argues\n\nthat its decisions regarding Hayes were based on neither discrimination nor retaliation but\n\nwere instead the result of Hayes’s lack of qualifications relative to Joel Anthony—the\n\nperson ultimately selected as Acting and Permanent Deputy Director—and Hayes’s poor\n\njob performance generally. Finally, HHS contends that Hayes may not, as a matter of\n\nlaw, raise a motivating-factor retaliation claim under Title VII.\n\n            B. The Agency’s Structure\n\n       HHS is the United States government’s principal agency for protecting and\n\npromoting the health of Americans. The Administration for Children and Families is the\n\ncomponent of HHS responsible for federal programs that promote the economic and\n\nsocial well-being of children and families. ACF’s Office of Administration helps it\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fadminister these programs and consists of four divisions: the Office of Grants\n\nManagement, the Office of Financial Services, the Office of Management Resources, and\n\nthe Office of Information Services.\n\n            C. Hayes’s Background\n\n        Hayes, an African American, became ACF’s first-ever Procurement Advisor in\n\nJanuary 2003. Hayes Dep. 48, Aug. 28, 2009, ECF No. 48-3. The GS-15 Step 10 position\n\nwas created especially for him as part of the settlement of an EEO case he filed against\n\nHHS in 2001. Id. at 49–56. Hayes’s primary responsibility was to advise ACF staff on\n\nacquisition issues. Id. at 56–58. Specifically, he was to “[p]rovide[] expert advice and\n\ncounsel to ACF officials on procurement issues, develop[] guidance, [and] ensure[]\n\ncompliance with applicable regulations, rules and policies.” Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4 at ECF\n\np. 2. His duties also included “performing various tasks necessary to analyze, evaluate,\n\nand improve ACF management practices or systems as they relate to acquisition\n\npractices.” Id.\n\n            D. The Acting Deputy Director Position\n\n        Until August of 2006, Hayes’s first-level supervisor was Robert Velasco, the\n\nDeputy Director in the Office of Administration. Hayes Dep. 60–61. His second-level\n\nsupervisor was Curtis Coy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of\n\nAdministration. Coy Dep. 5, 28, Apr. 15, 2009, ECF No. 48-5. After learning that\n\nVelasco was leaving the Office of Administration, Coy looked to fill the Deputy Director\n\nposition on a temporary basis. Id. 64–66. He sought his four Division Directors’ input\n\nand asked each of them whether they had any interest in taking the position. Id. The\n\nDivision Directors at that time were Joel Anthony, Tony Hardy, Cheryl Jones, and\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fMichael Curtis. Id. 53–54. Hardy and Jones are African American, and Anthony and\n\nCurtis are white. Hayes Dep. 90.\n\n          Curtis and Jones expressed no interest in the position. Curtis Dep. 106–07, Apr.\n\n23, 2009; Jones Dep. 93, Apr. 21, 2009. After considering it overnight, Hardy told Coy\n\nthat he “wasn’t really interested in it, but . . . that if asked, [he] would do the deputy\n\nposition.” Hardy Dep. 71, Apr. 27, 2009; Coy Dep. 76–77. Anthony told Coy that “he’d\n\nbe excited to take [the position].” Coy Dep. 75–77. Having gauged his four division\n\ndirectors’ individual interests, Coy met with them about whom to put in the job. Hardy\n\nDep. 74. Ultimately, he made Anthony the Acting Deputy Director. Coy Dep. 80–81.\n\n          Hayes was on a three-week vacation when this selection process took place, Coy\n\nDep. 82–87; Hayes Dep. 92–93, 95–97, and returned to find that Coy had made Anthony\n\nActing Deputy Director while he was away. Hayes Dep. 102. In nearly four years in the\n\noffice, Hayes never once expressed any interest in the Deputy Director post. Hayes Dep.\n\n93, 95–98. But upon learning of Coy’s decision, he let Coy know for the first time that he\n\nwould have been interested in it. Id. at 102–03. Although he would not have received any\n\nextra compensation for filling the Acting Deputy Director position, he desired it because\n\nhe saw it as a “possible stepping stone to a SES [Senior Executive Service] position.” Id.\n\nat 101.\n\n              E. The Permanent Deputy Director Position\n\n          Coy began looking to fill the Deputy Director position permanently in December\n\n2006. Statement Undisputed Facts Support Mot. Summ. J. 7, May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48-\n\n2. He was under no obligation to send out a solicitation of interest and could have simply\n\nmade Anthony the Deputy Director unilaterally and without any extra process. Coy Dep.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f122–24. Explaining that he “wanted to be fair to everyone” who might be interested in\n\nthe position, though, he solicited interest in the job ACF-wide. Statement Undisputed\n\nFacts Support Mot. Summ. J. 7. In the end, only Hayes and Anthony applied. Coy Dep. at\n\n127; Ivery Dep. 84–86.\n\n       Hayes does not dispute that Anthony was the better-qualified candidate. Anthony\n\nhad worked in grants policy, management positions, and the President’s Management\n\nAgenda. Anthony Aff. at ECF pp. 5–6, November 5, 2007, ECF No. 55-15. Having\n\nbegun his federal career in 1974, Anthony had managed several of ACF’s grants-related\n\noffices as well as the development of its Grants Administration Policy Manual in 1995.\n\nId. at ECF p. 5. He managed several “operations” offices—the offices that award and\n\nadminister contracts and grants—as well as “policy” offices. Id. This experience was of\n\nparticular importance to the Deputy Director position because ACF is a grant-making\n\nagency with a $48 billion grants budget, and nearly every one of its significant initiatives\n\ninvolves grants and grants management. Id.\n\n       With nearly twenty-five years’ experience as a federal supervisor performing the\n\nentire array of supervisory responsibilities, Anthony had managed several large financial\n\nmanagement organizations, including one with 60 employees. Id. at ECF pp. 5–6.\n\nAnthony’s experience did not go unnoticed. He received the highest possible\n\nperformance rating—Outstanding—the past ten years in a row. Id. at ECF p. 6. In 2001,\n\nhe received the ACF Distinguished Achievement Award, and in 2004, he received the\n\nhighest honor bestowed on managers at ACF—the ACF Honor Award for Exemplary\n\nLeadership. Id. Hayes, while rated Excellent several times, never received a single\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fOutstanding rating and garnered no similar awards recognizing any significant leadership\n\nqualities. Hayes Dep. 223.\n\n       Hayes did not have any functional responsibilities within the Office of\n\nAdministration’s four divisions. Coy Decl. ¶ 4, May 10, 2010, ECF No. 55-11. He had\n\nnever been a grants officer, had never assigned or awarded a grant, had never been\n\nresponsible for administering a grant, had never received training in administering a\n\ngrant, and he did not have any level of certification in the grants certification process.\n\nHayes Dep. 141–43. He also had no responsibility for information technology or\n\nmanagement resources. Id. 12–48. Finally, Hayes did not supervise any employees from\n\n2003–2006. Id. at 60; Coy Decl. ¶ 3. From 1997–2001, he had supervised a staff of 14\n\npeople, and in the 1980s he supervised a staff of four. Statement Undisputed Facts\n\nSupport Mot. Summ. J. 8. In fact, another reason Hayes was interested in the position\n\nwas that he saw it as a chance to be a supervisor again. Hayes Dep. 101.\n\n       Coy had a panel interview both candidates. Coy Dep. 127–28. The panel\n\nconsisted of Coy, Segundo Pereira—the Director of Diversity Management and the\n\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Policy at HHS—and Diane Dawson.\n\nDawson, an African American, is the Director of ACF’s Office of Regional Operations.\n\nId.; see also Dawson Dep. 13, 22–23, Apr. 21, 2009, ECF No. 48-10; Pereira Dep. 13–14,\n\n26, Apr. 23, 2009, ECF No. 48-11; Hayes Dep. at 124–25. The panel interviewed the\n\ncandidates one after the other, asking them the same questions. Pereira Dep. 34, 42;\n\nDawson Dep. 33; Coy Dep. 133–34.\n\n       The panel interviewed Hayes first. Pereira Dep. 45; Dawson Dep. 33. Despite\n\nhaving not interviewed in fifteen years, Hayes did nothing to prepare for the interview\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fother than review his application. Hayes Dep. 122–23. He was “surprised” by the\n\nquestions at the interview, which included “what would you do in your first thirty days on\n\nthe job,” id. at 128–29, and acknowledged that he had no “concrete” ideas about “what\n\n[he] wanted to do as Deputy Director.” Id. 130–31. He also expressed no substantive\n\nthoughts on what challenges faced the Deputy Director or what the Deputy Director’s\n\npriorities should be. Id. at 134–35. Anthony, on the other hand, appeared prepared for the\n\ninterview and provided much more comprehensive answers to the panel’s questions.\n\nPereira Dep. at 72; Dawson Dep. 51–53. His answers reflected the breadth of his\n\nexperience at HHS, including his extensive work on grants and acquisition matters.\n\nDawson Dep. 51–53.\n\n       After discussing the candidates, all three panel members concluded that Anthony\n\nwas clearly the better candidate. Pereira Dep. 69, 73–74; Dawson Dep. 56; Coy Dep.\n\n135–36. Pereira testified that Hayes’s interview was “the model of how not to interview.”\n\nPereira Dep. 80. Coy found that “it was apparent . . . that Mr. Anthony had prepared for\n\nthe interview, [and that he] had answers that were cogent and thoughtful and Mr. Hayes\n\nwas not so much.” Coy Dep. 136. Dawson said that “Mr. Hayes’s responses were much\n\nmore narrow and sort of not clearly, in [her] opinion, understanding the scope and the\n\nbreadth of the functions that were in that office, compared to Anthony who seemed to\n\nknow a lot about—a lot of different areas.” Dawson Dep. 53. Based on the unanimous\n\nrecommendation of the panel members, Coy selected Anthony to be Deputy Director.\n\nCoy Dep. 135–36.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f            F. Performance Appraisals\n\n       Hayes received annual performance appraisals as procurement advisor. Hayes\n\nDep. 222–23. He received a rating of Excellent for 2003, 2004, and 2005. Id. For each of\n\nthese reviews, Velasco rated his performance. Statement Undisputed Facts Support Mot.\n\nSumm. J. 11. In September 2006, before he left the Office of Administration, Velasco\n\ngave Hayes a summary rating of Excellent. Id. In December 2006, Anthony prepared his\n\n“final rating,” and said, “The Summary Rating prepared by Robert Velasco on September\n\n6, 2006 will be the final rating of record for Mr. Hayes. For the past couple of months,\n\nmy observation of his performance is consistent with the summary rating. His final rating\n\nof record is Excellent.” Id. at 11–12. Coy did not change the rating Velasco and Anthony\n\ngave Hayes. Id. at 12. Notably, Velasco gave summary ratings to all of the employees\n\nunder his supervision before he left the office. Anthony Dep. 158–59. Neither Anthony\n\nnor Coy changed any of these ratings. Id.\n\n       Hayes refused to sign his 2006 performance rating, something he had not done in\n\nprior years. Id.; Hayes Dep. 184–85. He wrote, “I refuse to sign the evaluation. I feel this\n\nrating is not accurate and Mr. Anthony has intentionally rated me below the rating I\n\ndeserve.” Hayes Dep. 185. He believed he should have received an Outstanding rating\n\nbecause Coy cited his projects in a September 29, 2006, e-mail thanking the Office of\n\nAdministration for their “contributions over the past year.” Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2 at ECF\n\np. 8, May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48-17.\n\n       Coy and Anthony observed a steady decline in Hayes’s job performance in 2007.\n\nCoy Aff. ¶ 7, May 10, 2010, ECF No. 48-7; Anthony Aff. ¶ 15, April 23, 2010, ECF No.\n\n48-9. They rated his performance on four individual performance outcomes and one\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fadministrative requirement. Statement Undisputed Facts Support Mot. Summ. J. 17. The\n\nfirst individual performance outcome was based on Hayes’s proactively working toward\n\nHHS’s procurement consolidation efforts, communicating information to Office of\n\nAdministration staff on procurement policies and procedures, and analyzing new or\n\nproposed procurement legislation, regulations, and testimony to determine their impact\n\non ACF. Id. They rated Hayes Minimally Successful on this requirement because his\n\nefforts regarding procurement consolidation were neither proactive nor effective. Id. He\n\nalso failed to communicate information to ACF staff on new or revised federal and HHS\n\nprocurement policies and procedures, including analyzing new or proposed procurement\n\nlegislation to determine its impact on ACF programs. Id. In fact, he failed to provide any\n\nanalysis of the numerous 2007 federal acquisition circulars. Id.\n\n       The second individual performance outcome required Hayes to assist the Deputy\n\nSecretary and Deputy Director in fulfilling their management priorities and to provide\n\noversight of the issuance of ACF credit cards, including maintaining information on the\n\ncard holders and approvers. Id. They rated him Minimally Successful on this requirement\n\nbecause he provided neither Anthony nor Coy with useful reports on the status of ACF\n\nprocurement matters during the year. Id. He also failed to have much, if any, involvement\n\nin the ACF credit card program. Id.\n\n       The third individual performance outcome required Hayes to assist ACF\n\ncustomers in choosing efficient and effective procurement strategies. Id. at 18. Anthony\n\nand Coy rated Hayes Fully Successful on this requirement. Id.\n\n       The fourth individual performance outcome required Hayes to provide oversight\n\nfor the Procurement Tracking System. Id. They rated Hayes Minimally Successful on this\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\frequirement because it was unclear to Anthony and Coy that Hayes had done anything\n\nwith respect to the Procurement Tracking System. Id. He did not provide them with\n\nuseful reports regarding the system, and he did not take any action to ensure that the\n\nsystem’s information on ACF’s intranet was current. Id. As far as Anthony could tell,\n\nnothing new on the system had been added to ACF’s intranet that year. Id.\n\n       The administrative requirement called on Hayes to identify and communicate his\n\nindividual developmental needs and to work with his supervisors to establish a\n\nperformance plan for the year. Id. Coy and Anthony rated Hayes Minimally Successful\n\non this requirement because he failed during 2007 to work with his supervisors on\n\nestablishing a performance plan and failed to provide them with self-assessments. Id. On\n\nJune 18, 2007, Anthony asked Hayes to provide him with comments regarding his\n\nperformance for the year so that they could be incorporated into his mid-year progress\n\nreview. Id. Hayes did not respond. Id. at 19. On December 5, 2007, Anthony asked Hayes\n\nto provide him with a description of his accomplishments during the year so that they\n\ncould be reflected in his final performance rating. Id. Hayes did not respond. Id. On\n\nDecember 14, 2007, Anthony reiterated his request for information about Hayes’s\n\naccomplishments during the year, but Hayes, again, failed to respond. Id. Hayes also did\n\nnot identify any developmental needs that he had as Procurement Advisor. Id.\n\n       Based on the ratings Hayes received on the individual performance outcomes and\n\nthe administrative requirement, his overall performance rating for 2007 was Minimally\n\nSuccessful. Id. This was the first rating Hayes received under the new four-tier rating\n\nsystem. Coy Aff. ¶ 7, May 10, 2010, ECF No. 48-7 (noting that the ratings available were\n\nExceptional, Fully Successful, Minimally Successful, and Unacceptable). Hayes believed\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fhe should have been rated Exceptional but provided no information to Anthony or Coy\n\nexplaining the basis for his belief. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 9 at ECF pp. 59–60.\n\n         On February 4, 2008, Anthony and Coy gave Hayes a workplan that set forth\n\nspecific expectations of him for the year. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4 at ECF pp. 62–65. Coy\n\nalso met with him that afternoon to go over the workplan. Id. Their hope was that, in light\n\nof Hayes’s 2007 Minimally Successful rating, the workplan would ensure the “new\n\nperformance period [would] begin with [Hayes having] a clear understanding of what\n\n[was] expected of [him] in 2008.” Id.\n\n            G. The Performance Improvement Plan\n\n         By April 4, 2008, though, Anthony and Coy had determined that Hayes’s\n\nperformance was not improving. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 11 at ECF p. 67. Coy provided him\n\nwith a “Performance Update” memorandum that described the deficiencies in his\n\nperformance. Id. He was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan, or PIP, on April\n\n22, 2008. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 12 at ECF p. 80. The PIP did not affect his pay, job title,\n\nwork hours, or responsibilities, but it did state that if Hayes did not improve his\n\nperformance he could be terminated. Id. at ECF p. 88. Ultimately, though, no action was\n\ntaken against him, and he remains procurement advisor with the same pay and hours\n\ntoday.\n\n   II. Legal Standard\n\n         A. Summary Judgment\n\n         Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, the discovery and\n\ndisclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fCiv. P. 56(c). This standard requires more than the mere existence of some factual\n\ndispute between the parties to defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for\n\nsummary judgment; “the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (emphasis in original). A material\n\nfact is one that, under the substantive law applicable to the case, is capable of affecting\n\nthe outcome of the litigation. Id. An issue is genuine where the “evidence is such that a\n\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,” as opposed to evidence\n\nthat is “so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Id. at 248, 252. The\n\nnonmoving party’s evidence is to be believed, and all reasonable inferences from the\n\nrecord are to be drawn in that party’s favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S\n\n242, 255 (1986).\n\n       B. Title VII\n\n       Title VII of the Civil Rights Act provides that employment decisions by federal\n\nemployers must be “made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). It also prohibits retaliation against any\n\nemployee because she “has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any\n\nmanner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-3(a).\n\n       The Court considers Hayes’s claims of discrimination and retaliation under the\n\ntraditional Mcdonnell Douglas framework. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792, 802–04 (1973). First, the plaintiff must prove a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation. Id. at 802. To show a prima facie case of discrimination, a\n\nplaintiff must show that “(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fadverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of\n\ndiscrimination.” Stella v. Mineta, 284 F.3d 135, 145 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Brown v.\n\nBrody, 199 F.3d 446, 452 (D.C. Cir. 1999)). A prima facie case of retaliation, similarly,\n\nrequires a plaintiff to establish “(1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2)\n\nthat he suffered a materially adverse action by his employer; and (3) that a causal link\n\nconnects the two.” Wiley v. Glassman, 511 F.3d 151, 155 (D.C. Cir. 2007). If the plaintiff\n\nproves a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S.\n\nat 802–04. Finally, if the defendant satisfies its burden, the plaintiff must prove that the\n\ndefendant’s stated reason is pretext for discrimination. Id. at 804–05.\n\n        In Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, the Court of Appeals simplified the\n\ndistrict courts’ analysis in most Title VII discrimination suits. 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2008); see also Jones v. Bernanke, 557 F.3d 670, 678 (D.C.Cir.2009) (holding that\n\nthe same analysis applies to a retaliation claim). It did so out of a recognition that “[i]n\n\nmost employment discrimination cases that reach federal court, there is no dispute that\n\nthe employee has suffered an adverse employment action.” Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550\n\nF.3d 1191, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Thus, because the prima facie\n\ndetermination had become a “largely unnecessary sideshow,” the Court held that in Title\n\nVII disparate-treatment suits, the district court need not determine if the plaintiff makes\n\nout a prima facie case of discrimination once the defendant has asserted a legitimate,\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for the challenged actions. Brady, 520 F.3d at 494. As a\n\nresult, the district court will usually be left with “one central question: Has the employee\n\nproduced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fnon-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against the employee on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin?” Id. In other words, the Court must determine if the plaintiff has produced enough\n\nevidence such that a reasonable jury could find that the defendant’s non-discriminatory\n\nreasons are mere pretext for the underlying unlawful discrimination.\n\n       Despite Brady’s admonition that district courts should not pause to examine\n\nwhether a plaintiff established a prima facie case when an employer offers a legitimate\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for its actions, HHS argues that many of the alleged adverse\n\nactions Hayes identifies are not sufficiently serious to support a discrimination or\n\nretaliation claim under Title VII. Therefore, the Court first considers whether the asserted\n\nemployment actions are sufficiently adverse to constitute adverse employment actions (or\n\nmaterially adverse employment actions in the retaliation context) under Title VII. See\n\nBaloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (proceeding directly to the\n\nBrady analysis may be premature, and courts should first assess whether there is evidence\n\nof an adverse action where that fact is contested). Assuming they are, the Court will then\n\nconsider whether there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that HHS’s\n\nproffered non-discriminatory reason for taking those actions is actually pretext to cover\n\nup underlying discrimination or retaliation.\n\n        The prima facie case standards for Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims\n\nboth contain the term “adverse action,” but “the concept [] in the retaliation context is\n\nbroader than in the discrimination context, and can encompass harms unrelated to\n\nemployment or the workplace ‘so long as a reasonable employee would have found the\n\nchallenged action materially adverse.’” Franklin v. Potter, 600 F. Supp. 2d 38, 66\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\f(D.D.C. 2009) (citing Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1198 n.4). For an employment action to be\n\nadverse in the discrimination context, it must result in “materially adverse consequences\n\naffecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or future employment\n\nopportunities such that a reasonable trier of fact could find objectively tangible harm.”\n\nForkkio v. Powell, 306 F.3d 1127, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Accordingly, an adverse\n\nemployment action is defined as “a significant change in employment status, such as\n\nhiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.” Id. at 552 (internal\n\ncitation and quotation omitted). Alleged acts of discrimination that do not constitute\n\nadverse employment actions cannot serve as the basis for a Title VII action. Brantley v.\n\nKempthorne, 2008 WL 2073913, at *4–*5 (D.D.C. May 13, 2008).\n\n       For an employment action to be materially adverse in the retaliation context, it\n\nmust be “harmful to the point that it could well dissuade a reasonable worker from\n\nmaking or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry.\n\nCo. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57 (2006). Finally, because of the difficulty of establishing\n\ndiscriminatory intent, “an added measure of rigor . . . or caution . . . is appropriate in\n\n[deciding] motions for summary judgment in employment discrimination cases.” Aka v.\n\nWash. Hosp. Ctr., 116 F.3d 876, 879–80 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted), rev’d on other grounds, 156 F.3d 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc).\n\n   III. Analysis\n\n       This Court’s Local Rule 7(b) states:\n\n       Within 11 days of the date of service or at such other time as the court\n       may direct, an opposing party shall serve and file a memorandum of points\n       and authorities in opposition to the motion. If such a memorandum is not\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f       filed within the prescribed time, the court may treat the motion as\n       conceded.\n\nRules of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, LCvR 7(b). Courts\n\nin this Circuit have interpreted Rule 7(b) to mean that when a plaintiff files an opposition\n\nto a dispositive motion that addresses only certain arguments the defendant raises, a court\n\nmay treat those arguments the plaintiff fails to address as conceded. FDIC v. Bender, 127\n\nF.3d 58, 67–78 (D.D.C. 2002). The D.C. Circuit has stated that “the discretion to enforce\n\n. . . [R]ule [7(b)] lies wholly with the district court,” id. at 67–68 (citing Twelve John\n\nDoes v. District of Columbia, 117 F.3d 571, 577 (D.C. Cir. 1997)), and noted that it\n\n“ha[s] yet to find that a district court’s enforcement of this rule constituted an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.” Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, because Hayes had the opportunity to\n\nrespond to all of the challenges to his claims, the Court will construe his failure to\n\nrespond to several of those challenges as a concession that HHS should prevail on them.\n\n       Specifically, Hayes does not respond to HHS’s challenges to five of his claims:\n\n(1) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by placing Anthony in the Acting\n\nDeputy Director position; (2) that his 2006 performance appraisal shows discrimination\n\nand retaliation; (3) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by monitoring his\n\nwork; (4) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by criticizing his work; and\n\n(5) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by giving him duties outside of his\n\nposition description. With that much of the underbrush cleared, three claims remain: (1)\n\nthat Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by placing Anthony in the Permanent\n\nDeputy Director position; (2) that his 2007 performance appraisal shows retaliation; and\n\n(3) that his placement on the PIP was both discriminatory and retaliatory. The Court will\n\naddress each of the remaining claims in turn.\n\n                                              16\n\f       A. Permanent Deputy Director Position\n\n                   1. HHS has produced admissible evidence to show that Coy\n                      believed Anthony was more qualified than Hayes for the\n                      Deputy Director position.\n\n       Hayes claims that Coy’s failure to select him for the Permanent Deputy Director\n\nposition was discriminatory and retaliatory. Coy responds that neither a retaliatory nor a\n\ndiscriminatory animus tainted his motivations in making the decision to hire Anthony for\n\nthe position. Instead, he puts forward a legitimate justification for the decision, namely\n\nthat Hayes was far less qualified for the position than Anthony. The question before the\n\nCourt, then, is whether Hayes has put forward sufficient evidence for a jury to be able to\n\ninfer reasonably that Coy’s explanation is pretext to cover up his true discriminatory or\n\nretaliatory motives.\n\n       Hayes does not dispute that Anthony was actually more qualified than he was for\n\nthe position. Instead, Hayes argues that “[b]ecause Defendant’s brief does not support his\n\nalleged reason with admissible evidence, it is insufficient to defeat the inference of\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation raised by plaintiff’s prima facie case.” Opp’n Mot. Summ.\n\nJ. 19, October 5, 2010, ECF No. 55. The brunt of Hayes’s argument is that Coy must\n\nshow that he—Coy himself—honestly believed that Anthony’s qualifications were better.\n\nTherefore, evidence like Anthony’s Affidavit or his resume will not suffice.\n\n       Hayes is correct that what matters is Coy’s honest belief about Hayes’s and\n\nAnthony’s relative qualifications and not what those qualifications actually are or what a\n\nreasonable person would think they are. Fischbach v. D.C. Dep’t of Corr., 86 F.3d 1180,\n\n1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“[T]he issue is not the correctness or desirability of the reasons\n\noffered but whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers.”); see also\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fAka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1296 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (concluding that\n\nwhere it was unclear that a supervisor was aware of one aspect of the plaintiff’s\n\nexperience, the court would not rely on that aspect of his qualifications when deciding\n\nsummary judgment based on the supervisor’s contention that he legitimately chose\n\nsomeone over the defendant because of their superior qualifications). The problem is that\n\nthere is admissible evidence that Coy considered Anthony more qualified. For instance, at\n\nhis deposition, Coy said that it was apparent at the interview that Anthony “had answers\n\nthat were cogent and thoughtful and Hayes was not so much.” Coy Dep. 135–36.\n\nMoreover, when specifically asked during the administrative process why he selected\n\nAnthony for the Deputy Director position, Coy said:\n\n       Mr. Anthony was prepared for the interview and came with specific\n       answers to questions. His last number of evaluations were Outstanding\n       and his resume provided a long list of awards and qualifications. He is and\n       was a current supervisor and has been continuously for several years. Mr.\n       Anthony is a seasoned and highly thought of manager well versed in\n       almost all of the issues that the Office of Administration deals with. His\n       grants, financial management, policy, and management experience made\n       him an excellent candidate. Mr. Hayes’ response to the Solicitation of\n       Interest indicated a finite level of interaction with senior level managers\n       within ACF, the Department, and other federal government agencies. His\n       resume indicated that his leadership skills and experience was leading a\n       team of contractors to develop and teach staff on how to use the\n       Procurement Tracking System, his last supervisory role was in January\n       2001. Mr. Hayes last several evaluations assessed him by the previous\n       Deputy as Excellent. He did not appear to be prepared for the interview\n       process.\n\nMot. Summ. J. Ex. 14 at ECF p. 7, May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48 (submitted with the Reply\n\nin Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment). Finally, beyond explicitly stating that\n\nhe chose Anthony because of his superior qualifications, Coy was clearly aware of their\n\nrelative qualifications from having supervised both of them. Coy supervised Anthony for\n\nseveral years in his role as a Division Director in the Office of Administration, indicating\n\n                                             18\n\fintimate knowledge of Anthony’s job duties. Anthony Dep. 12–13, Apr. 20, 2009, ECF\n\nNo. 48-8. He also signed all of Anthony’s performance appraisals during this time period,\n\nindicating awareness of Anthony’s performance over a long period of time. Mot. Summ.\n\nJ. Ex. 15 at ECF p. 16. Furthermore, Anthony submitted a resume to Coy as part of his\n\napplication for the Deputy Director position. Id. at ECF pp. 18–19; Coy Dep. 127. That\n\nresume outlined his superior qualifications, including having “[m]anaged every Financial\n\nManagement Function in ACF, including Division of Discretionary Grants, Division of\n\nGrants Policy, Division of Acquisition Management, and Office of Financial Services.”\n\nId. He would have also, therefore, known that Anthony had “unlimited signature\n\nauthority” as a “Contracting Officer” and a “Grants Officer,” and that he had “[d]irect\n\nand substantial experience managing all types of Federal financial assistance—\n\ndiscretionary, block, formula, and entitlement grants.” Id. Finally, Coy watched both\n\nHayes and Anthony interview and was able to compare their abilities to prove their\n\nqualifications on an even playing field, back to back, with two outside opinions to ensure\n\nfairness.\n\n        Hayes points to one portion of Coy’s Declaration that he claims shows that “Coy\n\ndid not even say, even summarily, that he selected Anthony because his qualifications\n\nwere superior.” Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 19–20. Pointing out that this one section from\n\nCoy’s Declaration does not contain the magic words, “I chose Anthony because he was\n\nmore qualified than Hayes for the position,” does not in any way prove that Coy did not\n\nchoose Anthony for that reason. Indeed, as discussed above, when asked point-blank why\n\nhe chose Anthony, Coy explained how Anthony was better-qualified in detail, displaying\n\nhis intimate knowledge of both candidates’ qualifications and his own reasonable\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fassessment of Anthony’s as better for the Deputy Director position than Hayes’s.\n\nTherefore, Hayes’s argument that HHS has not produced admissible evidence to support\n\nits legitimate explanation for choosing Anthony over him for the Deputy Director\n\nposition fails.\n\n                   2. Hayes raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether\n                      Coy’s contention that he chose Anthony for Deputy Director is\n                      pretext to cover up a retaliatory motive.\n\n        Hayes proceeds to argue that even if this Court decides that Coy has met his\n\nburden of putting forward a neutral, nondiscriminatory, nonretaliatory justification for\n\nplacing Anthony instead of him in the Deputy Director position, the record contains\n\nsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Coy’s proffered reason is mere\n\npretext. Mot. Summ. J. 21. The Court considers each of Hayes’s five arguments in turn.\n\n        First, he argues that “[w]hile Coy and the other two members of the selection\n\npanel claim that there was ‘unanimous’ or ‘mutual’ agreement as to the reasons Anthony\n\nwas to be chosen over Hayes, their accounts of this supposed agreement are inconsistent\n\nwith one another.” Id. Such inconsistency, Hayes argues, would allow a reasonable jury\n\nto infer a discriminatory and retaliatory motive on the part of the employer. Id. (citations\n\nomitted). This argument is unpersuasive because HHS never claimed that the panel\n\nmembers were unanimous in their reasons for choosing Anthony. Rather, it claims that\n\nthe panel members were unanimous in their ultimate decision to choose Anthony over\n\nHayes, and there is clearly more than enough evidence to prove that. See Dawson Dep. 50\n\n(“Q. And you thought Anthony was the better candidate? A. I did. Q. Because he had a\n\nbroader scope to his answers to the questions? A. That’s one reason, yes.”); Pereira Dep.\n\n69 (“But we have two candidates, and of the two, [Anthony] is by far the better\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\fcandidates, based on the answer that he provided during the interview.”); id. at 73–74\n\n(“Q. And the interview for him took 30 to 40 minutes also? A. yes. Q. Good. And all\n\nthree of you had the same conclusion? A. Yes.”); Coy Dep. 135–36 (Q. And what was\n\nyour decision? A. Well, after discussing it with the panel it was unanimous. Q. It was\n\nunanimous. In other words, the panel’s view was unanimous? A. Yes. Q. That Joel\n\nAnthony should be the Deputy, right? A. Yes.”). Thus, the agreement that all three\n\npanelists reference is an agreement that Anthony should be selected for the position, not\n\nthat all three have precisely the same reasons for drawing that conclusion.\n\n       One reason for having a panel interview is to get different points of view. If three\n\npeople all have different, but valid, reasons for choosing Anthony over Hayes, then Coy\n\ncan feel that much more comfortable about making that selection. If everyone thought\n\nabout hiring issues and viewed candidates in precisely the same way, little could be\n\ngained by having a panel interview. Thus, it would be unsurprising if the panelists did not\n\nhave precisely the same reasons for choosing Anthony. That said, contrary to Hayes’s\n\ncontention, the panelists actually did agree—by and large—in their reasons for selecting\n\nAnthony over Hayes. Dawson testified as follows:\n\n       Q. And you thought Anthony was the better candidate?\n\n       A. I did.\n\n       Q. Because he had a broader scope to his answers to the questions?\n\n       A. That’s one reason, yes.\n\n       Q. And Mr. Hayes was more narrow to his role in the Office of Administration?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fDawson Dep. at 50. She went on to testify that: “I believe, in terms of the two—\n\ncomparing the two interviewees, that Mr. Hayes’ responses were much more narrow and\n\nsort of not clearly, in my opinion, understanding the scope and the breadth of the\n\nfunctions that were in that office, compared to—Anthony who seemed to know a lot\n\nabout—a lot of different areas.” Id. at 53.\n\n        Pereira also explained his specific reasons for recommending that Anthony be\n\nselected. He said that Anthony’s answers to the interview questions “were more\n\ncomprehensive” than Hayes’s. (Pereira Dep. at 69–73). He went on to explain that Hayes\n\ndid not “seem to be taking [the interview] seriously,” id. at 64, and that he was staring at\n\nthe ceiling during the portions of the interview. Id. at 80–81. Thus, Pereira believed that\n\n“based on the answers that he provided during the interview,” Anthony was “by far the\n\nbetter candidate.” Id. at 69.\n\n        Coy also testified to the same effect, saying, “[I]t was apparent . . . that Mr.\n\nAnthony had prepared for the interview, [and that he] had answers that were more cogent\n\nand thoughtful and Mr. Hayes was not so much.” Coy Dep. 136; see also Mot. Summ. J.\n\nEx. 14 at ECF p. 7 (“Mr Anthony was prepared for the interview and came with specific\n\nanswers to questions.”) (submitted with the Reply in Support of the Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment). Accordingly, Hayes’s first argument is unpersuasive.\n\n        Hayes’s second argument is that a reasonable juror could conclude that Coy did\n\nnot have sufficient information to honestly believe that Anthony’s qualifications were\n\nbetter than Hayes’s. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 23–25. He says that Coy admitted at his\n\ndeposition that he had little or no knowledge of either Hayes’s or Anthony’s\n\nqualifications and that therefore a reasonable jury could find that he did not honestly\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\fselect Anthony based on qualifications. Id. at 25. As an example, Hayes points out that\n\nCoy did not have knowledge of Anthony’s supervisory duties in his position prior to\n\ncoming to the Office of Administration. Id. at 23–24 (citing Coy Dep. 25–26). But the\n\npassages Hayes cites do not support his argument. Coy was asked questions during his\n\ndeposition regarding his knowledge of Anthony’s and Hayes’s qualifications upon\n\nassuming the Deputy Assistant Secretary position in 2002. At that time, Coy did not\n\nknow either of them well. Coy Dep. 188–89. In working with the two of them for several\n\nintervening years, however, and in filling the Deputy Director position, Coy learned each\n\nof their respective qualifications well, as discussed above.\n\n       Third, Hayes argues that a reasonable jury might find Coy’s argument pretext\n\nbecause on the one hand, he stressed the crucial role Anthony’s grants experience played\n\nin his decision, but on the other, he hired Velasco—a non-African American who had not\n\nengaged in EEO activity—as his Deputy Director even though he had no grants\n\nexperience whatsoever. Id. at 25. This argument might be persuasive if the Velasco\n\ndecision and the Anthony decision were the same except for the prior EEO activity and\n\nrace of the applicants. But that is not the case. Instead, Hayes presents no evidence that\n\nCoy chose Velasco over a similarly situated candidate with grants experience. In fact, he\n\ndoes not even show that Coy had the option of choosing a candidate with grants\n\nexperience when he made the Velasco decision. The Anthony decision was different in\n\nthat Coy had one applicant with a great deal of important grants experience and another\n\ncandidate with none. Moreover, Coy testified that there were other reasons for choosing\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fAnthony as well. This argument, then, fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact. 2\n\n        Fourth, Hayes argues a reasonable jury could conclude that Coy lied about having\n\nconvened the interview panel in order to ensure that “everything was fair and above\n\nboard transparent.” Id. at 25–26. He says that Pereira and Dawson both claimed that\n\nCoy’s method of interviewing the candidates was out of the ordinary and notes that the\n\npanelists came into the interview with very little information about the candidates or the\n\nposition for which they were applying. Id. at 25. Therefore, the argument goes, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that “Coy failed to give the panel and Hayes information\n\nabout the position to give Anthony a competitive advantage in the selection process,”\n\nbecause Anthony was the Acting Deputy Director for several months leading up to the\n\ninterviews and would know the position better. Id.\n\n        There are two problems with Hayes’s argument. First, Coy was not required to\n\ngive out any more information than he did. Indeed, Hayes points to no evidence that Coy\n\nwas required to conduct an interview at all. Second, as to the allegation that Anthony had\n\na leg up because he was Acting Deputy Director, that may be true, but if it is, it is only\n\nbecause he was actually better-qualified. Experience in the position being interviewed for\n\nis a legitimate and valuable qualification to have coming into an interview—assuming\n\none has done a decent job in the position, as Anthony apparently had. But that does not\n\nmean that Coy “rigged” things for Anthony. Any advantage Anthony had, even under\n\nHayes’s argument, was directly linked to his superior qualifications.\n\n        Fifth, Hayes argues that the record contains evidence of Coy’s retaliatory attitude\n\nupon which a reasonable jury could infer that his true reason for not selecting Hayes for\n\n2\n  The same can be said for Hayes’s argument that Coy did not know that Velasco had supervisory\nexperience and yet he contends that Anthony’s supervisory experience was very important to his decision.\nId.\n\n                                                   24\n\fthe Deputy Director position was retaliatory animus. Id. at 27. He points to three\n\nexamples to justify his claim. First, at his deposition, Coy was asked, “You looked into\n\n[Hayes’s] background, however, didn’t you? . . . You’re a careful manager. You got a\n\nnew staff advisor. You wanted to know what he knew and what his experience was,\n\ndidn’t you? . . . .” Id. (citing Coy Dep. 189–90). Coy responded, “I didn’t look into Mr.\n\nHayes’ background . . . It was a result of an EEO settlement. He didn’t get put here\n\nbecause of any merit. It was because of an EEO settlement.” Id. Second, he points to\n\nCoy’s reaction to another employee’s successful EEO case. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 28.\n\nCoy said that the verdict “ha[d] shaken [him] in a way that other significant events in\n\n[his] recent past haven’t done.” Id. It was also evident to his staff that Coy was “very\n\nupset” by the verdict. Id. (citing Anthony Dep. 137). Third, Rhett Leverett, the EEO\n\ncounselor who interviewed Coy regarding Hayes’s complaint, testified as follows:\n\n       Mr. Coy was a bit agitated, perhaps angry. He was not happy about this\n       case was my feeling that I got from the phone conversation. He was\n       somewhat hostile. He did not enjoy talking to me. He was angry that Mr.\n       Hayes had brought the case, and he said to me while he’s carrying on,\n       “Mr. Leverett, it is morally repugnant,” and he said it with great\n       conviction that he brought this case. And he goes, “I want you to put that\n       in the report.” He ordered me to state that directly. I’ve never had a\n       manager do that in 200 cases. And I said, “Yes, sir.” . . . . He specifically\n       directed me to put that statement in the report, because he was so upset\n       that Mr. Hayes brought this case. That was a direct quote at his request in\n       a kind of nasty way . . . . I have never had anyone demand that before that\n       I put their quote in the report, because he was not happy, and he conveyed\n       that to me from the very beginning of the phone conversation to the end\n       that he did not like this.\n\nOpp’n Mot. Summ. J. 29 (citing Leverett Dep. 20–21, Apr. 28, 2009, ECF No. 55-8). The\n\nEEO counselor further testified that he believed Coy was angered that Hayes had charged\n\nhim with discrimination in the past and that he was hostile toward Hayes because of the\n\ncharge. Levertt Dep. 21. The Court will analyze each of these statements in some detail.\n\n                                             25\n\f        First, Coy said, “He didn’t get put here because of any merit. It was because of an\n\nEEO settlement.” Coy Dep. 189–90. Analyzing this statement in isolation, Coy does not\n\ncommit himself to any view of Hayes’s merit. It is technically possible, for example, that\n\nCoy believed that Hayes had infinite merit; he just did not believe that Hayes became\n\nprocurement advisor because of it. It is also logically possible, if one analyzes this\n\nstatement in isolation, that Coy thought Hayes has absolutely no merit at all; again, his\n\nmerit did not play a factor in his acquisition of the procurement advisor position.\n\n        But Coy did not make this statement in isolation. It arose in the context of lengthy\n\ndeposition questioning regarding whether he had—at any point—looked into Hayes’s\n\nbackground:\n\n        Q. You’re a careful manager. You got a new staff advisor. You wanted to\n        know what he knew and what his experience was, didn’t you? A. I didn’t\n        look into Mr. Hayes’ background. Q. Didn’t inquire as to what he had\n        done before so you knew what you could rely on his advice on\n        procurement? You, the careful new head of the Office of Administration\n        here at ACF, didn’t do it? A. It was the result of an EEO settlement. He\n        didn’t get put here because of any merit. It was because of an EEO\n        settlement.\n\n\nCoy Dep. 189. Given this context, a reasonable jury could conclude that Hayes’s EEO\n\nsettlement served as justification—in Coy’s mind—for not taking a serious look at\n\nHayes’s qualifications as he considered whom to put in the Deputy Director position. If\n\nthe jury drew such an inference, then it would appear that Coy viewed Hayes’s EEO\n\nsettlement as a badge of inferiority that justified giving his qualifications short-shrift in\n\nfuture employment decisions.\n\n        The second statement has to do with Coy’s displeasure at having lost a prior EEO\n\ncase. This statement has no direct connection to Hayes’s EEO activity in this case, and\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fthus, it could not raise a genuine issue of material fact on its own. Yet, a reasonable jury\n\ncould conclude from this statement that Coy is hostile to EEO activity in general, making\n\nit more likely than it would be in the absence of this evidence that he chose Anthony\n\ninstead of Hayes in order to retaliate against Hayes for filing an EEO complaint after\n\nbeing passed over for consideration for the Acting Deputy Director position.\n\n       The third statement, which arose during Coy’s interview with Leverett, tends to\n\nshow how much Hayes’s EEO complaint upset Coy. Although it is understandable that\n\naccusations of discrimination would upset an employer, Coy’s comments here go beyond\n\nthat normal displeasure for two reasons. First, his reaction was so extreme that Leverett\n\nsaid he had never seen anything like it in over 200 EEO cases. It was enough to cause the\n\nEEO counselor to conclude that Coy was hostile toward Hayes because of the charge.\n\nLeverett Dep. 21. Second, Coy found Hayes’s complaint “morally repugnant.” Id. It is\n\none thing to find an accusation of discrimination upsetting. It is quite another to claim\n\nthat an employee’s participation in the EEO process is morally repugnant. Therefore, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that Coy did not give Hayes a fair shake in the Deputy\n\nDirector selection process because Coy could not see past what he considered to be the\n\nmoral repugnancy of Hayes’s EEO activities.\n\n       Coy argues that some of these statements are insufficient to raise an inference of\n\nretaliation because they concern things that happened years before the selection decision\n\nat issue. That argument falls short. The Supreme Court has held that where the inference\n\nof retaliation hinges exclusively on the temporal proximity of the protected activity and\n\nthe adverse action, they must have occurred “very close” in time to one another. Clark\n\nCounty School Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273–74 (2001) (“The cases that accept\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fmere temporal proximity between an employer’s knowledge of protected activity and an\n\nadverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie\n\ncase uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be ‘very close.’”) (citations\n\nomitted). Here, though, the inference springs not from the temporal proximity of\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action but instead from Coy’s own words, their hostile\n\ntone, and their precise application to the very EEO activity that Hayes took in this case.\n\n       A reasonable jury could, therefore, conclude that Coy’s explanation that he chose\n\nAnthony because he was better-qualified is pretext to cover up his underlying hostility\n\ntoward Hayes’s EEO activity. For that reason, the Court will deny HHS’s Motion with\n\nregard to this aspect of Hayes’s claim.\n\n       B. Minimally Successful Performance Rating in 2007 and PIP Placement\n\n       Next, Hayes argues that Coy and Anthony attempted to falsely characterize\n\nAnthony as Hayes’s supervisor to insulate Coy—who has previously been found guilty of\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation by a jury—from another discrimination and retaliation\n\nallegation. EEOC v. C.G. Schmidt, Inc., 670 F.Supp.2d 858, 868–69 (E.D. Wis. 2009)\n\n(holding that concealing the involvement of a decision maker who responded to\n\nplaintiff’s earlier EEO complaint in retaliation case supported an inference of retaliatory\n\nmotive). It is true that Anthony admits in his Affidavit that he was Hayes’s supervisor “in\n\nname only.” Anthony Aff. 3. Then at his Deposition, Anthony says that Coy “made it\n\nclear” that he would be required to supervise Hayes as Deputy Director. Anthony Dep.\n\n110–11. Hayes claims that these inconsistent statements were meant to cover up Coy’s\n\ninvolvement in putting him on the PIP and giving him a Minimally Successful rating in\n\n2007. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 29–33.\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       Whatever inconsistencies or tensions there may be in Coy’s and Anthony’s\n\nstatements regarding whether and to what extent Anthony supervised Hayes, they can\n\nonly raise a genuine issue of material fact if a reasonable jury could infer that they were\n\npart of a scheme to cover up Coy’s involvement in placing Hayes on the PIP and giving\n\nhim a Minimally Successful rating. In other words, Hayes may not avoid summary\n\njudgment simply by finding any inconsistency in Anthony’s or Coy’s testimony; he must\n\nshow that the inconsistency could give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination or\n\nretaliation. Other evidence makes clear, however, that no such cover-up was going on.\n\n       First, regarding the PIP, because Hayes has not shown that his placement on it\n\n“affected [his] grade or salary” or that it constituted a “significant change in employment\n\nstatus,” it is not an adverse employment action capable of supporting a discrimination\n\nclaim. Taylor v. Small, 350 F.3d 1286, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 2003). To sustain a retaliation\n\nclaim, however, he need only raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his\n\nplacement on the PIP would have “dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or\n\nsupporting a charge of discrimination.” Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548\n\nU.S. 53, 67–69 (2006). A PIP that does not rise to the level of a materially adverse action\n\nfor the purposes of a disparate treatment claim may still satisfy this more liberal standard.\n\nSee Chowdhury v. Blair, 605 F. Supp. 2d 90, 96–97 (D.D.C. 2009) (holding that\n\nplacement on a PIP was materially adverse in the context of a retaliation claim but not\n\nmaterially adverse for disparate treatment purposes because the PIP could dissuade a\n\nreasonable employee from engaging in protected activity even if it did not affect the\n\nemployee’s grade or salary).\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f       Coy cites Kelly v. Mills, 677 F. Supp. 2d 206, 222 (D.D.C. 2010), for the\n\nproposition that “placing plaintiff on a PIP [does not] constitute an adverse employment\n\naction,” but in the passage referenced, the Court was discussing adverse employment\n\nactions for the purpose of a discrimination—not a retaliation—claim. Id. Later, in the\n\nsame opinion, the Kelly Court holds that PIP placement can constitute a materially\n\nadverse employment action even without grade or salary consequences. Id. at 225 (citing\n\nRochon v. Gonzalez, 438 F.3d 1211, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Thus, the Court concludes\n\nthat Hayes’s PIP placement could dissuade a reasonable employee from pursuing a\n\ndiscrimination claim, and it will therefore consider Hayes’s arguments on that score.\n\n       The record shows that Coy ultimately decided to place Hayes on the PIP, and Coy\n\nsigned the PIP. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 12 at ECF p. 80. These undisputed facts contradict\n\nHayes’s allegation that Coy sought to cover up his involvement with the PIP placement to\n\nconceal his retaliatory motives. The record is similarly clear regarding Hayes’s\n\nMinimally Successful rating. Coy signed it personally—an action totally inconsistent\n\nwith the theory that he sought to cover up his involvement in the rating. Mot Summ. J.\n\nEx. 4 at ECF p. 72.\n\n       Moreover, there is evidence in the record that Anthony did act as Hayes’s\n\nsupervisor in more than name only. In March 2007, Coy told Hayes that “all\n\ncorrespondence/emails concerning job assignments you are working on should either be\n\nrouted through Joel [Anthony] as he is the Deputy and your direct supervisor – or at a\n\nminimum, he should be cc’d.” Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 17 at ECF p. 14. Hayes followed that\n\ninstruction, and Anthony provided supervisory feedback to him. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4 at\n\nECF pp. 76–78. These actions show that Anthony was Hayes’s supervisor in more than\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fname only and that Coy was not trying to cover up his own involvement in Hayes’s\n\nMinimally Successful rating.\n\n       Next, Hayes argues that a reasonable jury could conclude that Coy’s inability—at\n\nhis 2009 deposition—to recall the reasons Hayes was placed on the PIP and given a\n\nMinimally Successful performance rating in 2007 would allow a reasonable jury to\n\nconclude that Coy’s proffered reasons are pretext to disguise a retaliatory motive for the\n\nactions. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 32–33. The fact that Coy cannot recall those details years\n\nlater does not show that they were not his reasons at the time he made the decisions at\n\nissue, though. In fact, as was discussed at length above, the record is replete with\n\ncontemporaneous documentation of precisely why Hayes was rated Minimally Successful\n\nand placed on the PIP. The Court will therefore grant HHS’s Motion with respect to\n\nHayes’s PIP placement and Minimally Successful rating claims.\n\n       C. Motivating-Factor Retaliation Claim\n\n       Whether Hayes intended it or not, the two paragraphs he tacked on to the end of\n\nhis Opposition to Summary Judgment articulating a “motivating factor” retaliation\n\nclaim—innocent though they may appear—present a complicated issue. The D.C. Circuit\n\nhas twice grappled with motivating-factor retaliation claims, and yet a question remains\n\nunanswered in the Circuit: Does Title VII currently permit a motivating-factor retaliation\n\nclaim? Hayes raises this claim for the first time in his Opposition, and HHS has several\n\nresponses. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that, as a matter of law, Hayes\n\nmay not bring such a claim.\n\n           1. The Statute, Price Waterhouse, and the 1991 Act\n\n\n       Title VII’s discrimination provision provides in relevant part:\n\n\n                                             31\n\f       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer—\n\n       (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual with respect to\n           his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n           because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n           origin; or\n       (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n           employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n           individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n           his status as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n           religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). And the Act’s retaliation provision provides:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\n       discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment,\n       for an agency, or joint labor-management committee controlling\n       apprenticeship or other training or retraining programs, to discriminate\n       against any individual, or for a labor organization to discriminate against\n       any member thereof or applicant for membership, because he has opposed\n       any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or\n       because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any\n       manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). In 1989, a plurality of the Supreme Court—in the context of a\n\nTitle VII discrimination case—held that once a “plaintiff proves that [the plaintiff’s\n\nmembership in a protected class] played a motivating part in an employment decision, the\n\ndefendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [that factor]\n\ninto account.” Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). Price Waterhouse\n\narose in the context of a discrimination claim, but the D.C. Circuit subsequently extended\n\nits burden-shifting framework to retaliation cases as well. See Thomas v. Nat’l Football\n\nLeague Players’ Ass’n, 131 F.3d 198 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (applying Price Waterhouse to a\n\npre-1991 retaliation claim under Title VII).\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\f       Responding to Price Waterhouse, Congress amended several aspects of Title VII\n\nin 1991. The purpose of these amendments, as the D.C. Circuit later explained, was “to\n\nprovide standards for mixed motive cases.” Porter v. Natsios, 414 F.3d 13, 18 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2005) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90 (2003)). The 1991 Act added a\n\nprovision to Title VII that explicitly provides for employer liability based on evidence\n\nthat an impermissible consideration was “a motivating factor” in the employer’s decision:\n\n       [A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining\n       party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a\n       motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors\n       also motivated the practice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m). While codifying Price Waterhouse’s recognition of liability in\n\nmixed-motives cases, this new provision also overruled one of that case’s central\n\nholdings by limiting the employer’s exposure to certain remedies. This aspect of the Act\n\nhas come to be called the “same action” affirmative defense:\n\n       On a claim in which an individual proves a violation under section 2000e-\n       2(m) of this title and a respondent demonstrates that the respondent would\n       have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating\n       factor, the court-\n       (i)      may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief . . ., and attorney’s\n                fees and costs . . .; and\n       (ii)     shall not award damages or issue an order requiring any admission,\n                reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment . . . .\nId. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Thus the 1991 Act’s motivating-factor framework allows\n\nemployees to establish a Title VII violation under § 2000e-2(m) “without proving that an\n\nimpermissible consideration was the sole or but-for motive for the employment action,\n\nwhile providing the employer with a ‘limited affirmative defense’ under § 2000e-\n\n5(g)(2)(B) ‘that does not absolve it of liability, but restricts the remedies available to a\n\nplaintiff.’” Porter, 414 F.3d at 19 (citing Desert Palace, 539 U.S. at 94). This limited\n\naffirmative defense abrogated the portion of Price Waterhouse that provided a complete\n\n                                              33\n\fdefense in cases where an employer who shows that the illicit motive was not the but-for\n\ncause of the employment decision. Both Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Amendments,\n\nhowever, dealt only with Title VII discrimination claims.\n\n           2. The D.C. Circuit recognizes that, in light of the 1991 Act, it is now an\n              open question whether Title VII plaintiffs may bring mixed-motives\n              retaliation claims under Price Waterhouse or motivating-factor\n              retaliation claims under the 1991 Act.\n       The above discussion makes clear that, following the 1991 Amendments, mixed-\n\nmotives discrimination cases are subject to the Act’s motivating-factor analysis, and not\n\nto Price Waterhouse’s burden-shifting regime. An open question remains, however, as to\n\nwhat analysis, if any, is proper in the context of mixed-motives retaliation claims. As\n\ndiscussed above, the D.C. Circuit previously extended the Price Waterhouse framework\n\nto retaliation claims, but it has subsequently expressed concern that the 1991 Act may\n\ncall the legitimacy of this prior extension into question. Borgo v. Goldin, 204 F.3d 251,\n\n255 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“[W]hile discrimination claims . . . were covered by the 1991\n\nAct, Congress did not expressly include retaliation claims in the provision that modified\n\nPrice Waterhouse. Some circuits have held that retaliation claims are not covered by the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1991 and are still governed by Price Waterhouse. This circuit has not\n\naddressed that question.”) (citations omitted). Five years later, the Court of Appeals\n\nreiterated that courts need to examine the 1991 Amendments to determine whether or not\n\nthe Act’s motivating factor analysis should apply with equal force to the retaliation\n\ncontext, but it did not mention whether Price Waterhouse’s relevance was still in\n\nquestion. Porter v. Natsios, 414 F.3d 13, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“[A]lthough every circuit\n\nto address the issue has held that the mixed motive provisions of the 1991 Act do not\n\napply to retaliation claims, it remains an open question in this circuit.”) (citations\n\n\n                                              34\n\fomitted). In sum, it appears there are two open questions. First, does the 1991 Act allow\n\nTitle VII motivating-factor retaliation claims? Second, if it does not, may Title VII\n\nplaintiffs still bring mixed-motives retaliation claims under Price Waterhouse?\n\nThankfully, the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Gross v. FBL Servs., Inc., 129 S.Ct.\n\n2343 (2009), provides a clear answer to both of these vexatious questions.\n\n             3. The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Gross v. FBL Services, Inc.,\n                resolves any doubt: Title VII plaintiffs may bring neither mixed-\n                motives retaliation claims under Price Waterhouse nor motivating-\n                factor retaliation claims under the 1991 Act.\n         Although it was an ADEA case, the Supreme Court in Gross construed text that is\n\nin relevant part identical to the language of Title VII at issue here. Specifically, the\n\nADEA provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or\n\nto discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect\n\nto his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such\n\nindividual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). This language is\n\nindistinguishable from Title VII’s discrimination and retaliation provisions, both of\n\nwhich contain the same “because of” formulation. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall\n\nbe an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to\n\ndischarge any individual . . . because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\n\nnational origin . . . .”) (emphasis added); id. at 2000e-3(a) (“It shall be an unlawful\n\nemployment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or\n\napplicants for employment . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful\n\nemployment practice by this subchapter . . . .”) (emphasis added). 3\n\n\n3\n The Court recognizes that, technically speaking, “because of” and “because” are not exactly the same\nphrasing. The Court finds, however, that syntactical differences in the respective provisions, rather than\nany substantive difference in meaning, account for the slight variation here.\n\n                                                     35\n\f       In Price Waterhouse, the Supreme Court interpreted “because of” in Title VII’s\n\ndiscrimination provision and held that “[t]o construe the words ‘because of’ as colloquial\n\nshorthand for ‘but-for causation,’ . . . is to misunderstand them.” Price Waterhouse, 490\n\nU.S. at 240 (citations omitted) (going on to hold that the “because of” language allowed\n\nplaintiffs to prove Title VII liability merely by showing that their employer’s adverse\n\naction against them was brought about in part by an illegal motive). The Supreme\n\nCourt’s recent decision in Gross, however, makes clear that Price Waterhouse’s\n\ninterpretation of “because of” is flatly incorrect. As an initial matter, the Gross Court\n\nfocused on the proper meaning of this phrase to determine whether a mixed-motives jury\n\ninstruction like the one permitted under Price Waterhouse was available under the\n\nADEA. Gross, 129 S.Ct. at 2350 (“Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the\n\nADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does\n\nnot.”). It concluded that “because of” in the ADEA means “by reason of,” and thus an\n\nADEA “plaintiff must prove that age was the ‘but-for’ cause of the employer’s adverse\n\ndecision.” Id. (emphasis added). Moreover, in reaching this decision, the Gross Court\n\ncalled Price Waterhouse’s reasoning into question, announcing that “it is far from clear\n\nthat the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question [of Price\n\nWaterhouse’s mixed-motives burden-shifting framework] today in the first instance.” Id.\n\nat 2351–52 (citations omitted). It went on to question Price Waterhouse’s wisdom\n\nfurther, noting that “it has become evident in the years since [Price Waterhouse] was\n\ndecided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply.” Id. at 2351. The Court\n\nconcluded that “the problems associated with Price Waterhouse have eliminated any\n\nperceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims.” Id. For these same\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\freasons, as well as the D.C. Circuit’s prior recognition that the 1991 Act calls Price\n\nWaterhouse’s continued viability into question, this Court will not apply that opinion’s\n\ninterpretation of “because of” to Title VII’s retaliation provision. 4\n\n        Having foreclosed Price Waterhouse’s application to Title VII’s retaliation\n\nprovision in light of the Gross Court’s criticisms, this Court now turns to whether the\n\n1991 Act provides an independent basis for a motivating-factor retaliation claim. Relying\n\non the Gross Court’s other reasons for not permitting such a claim under the ADEA, this\n\nCourt concludes that Title VII, after the 1991 Act, does not permit plaintiffs to bring\n\nmotivating-factor retaliation claims.\n\n        A central basis for the Gross Court’s holding was Congress’s decision to\n\nexplicitly provide for motivating-factor discrimination claims under Title VII in the 1991\n\nAct while making no similar provision for such claims under the ADEA. As the Court\n\nexplained, “[w]hen Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is\n\npresumed to have acted intentionally.” Id. at 2349 (citations omitted).The Court noted\n\nthat Congress’s inaction was especially important here because it considered and\n\namended both statutes at the same time but chose to provide for motivating-factor claims\n\nunder one and not the other. Id. (“[N]egative implications raised by disparate provisions\n\nare strongest when the provisions were considered simultaneously when the language\n\nraising the implication was inserted.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In\n\nthe case currently before the Court, Congress made changes to various parts of Title VII\n\naffecting both discrimination and retaliation claims. When it came to crafting the\n\nmotivating-factor analysis, however, it amended one section of Title VII and was silent\n\n4\n  It bears noting that the Gross Court had no occasion to overrule Price Waterhouse even if it was so\ninclined because Price Waterhouse was a Title VII case—not an ADEA case like Gross. Thus, the fact that\nthe Court called Price Waterhouse into question takes on greater than normal significance.\n\n                                                  37\n\fas to another provision of Title VII. Thus, the inference that Congress considered both\n\nprovisions and was therefore intentional in its disparate application of the motivating-\n\nfactor provision applies with even greater force here.\n\n       The Gross Court also held that Title VII’s structure made clear that the 1991\n\nmotivating-factor amendment only applies to Title VII’s discrimination provision. It\n\npointed out that Congress’s 1991 amendment to Title VII not only explicitly added\n\nmotivating-factor liability to Title VII, but also eliminated the employer’s complete\n\naffirmative defense to motivating-factor claims. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). “If such\n\n‘motivating factor’ claims were already part of Title VII,” the Court explained, “the\n\naddition of § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) alone would have been sufficient.” Id. at 2352 n.5. The\n\nCourt thus concluded that “Congress’s careful tailoring of the ‘motivating factor’ claim in\n\nTitle VII, as well as the absence of a provision parallel to § 20003-e2(m) in the ADEA,\n\nconfirms that we cannot transfer the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework into\n\nthe ADEA.” Id. This argument applies with even greater force to the case currently\n\nbefore the Court, and Congress’s 1991 motivating-factor amendment to Title VII must\n\napply only to discrimination claims. Otherwise, as the Gross Court explained, Section\n\n2000e-5(g)(2)(B) would have been sufficient on its own to make the adjustment Congress\n\nallegedly intended. Thus, the only construction that gives meaning both to Section 2000e-\n\n5(g)(2)(B) as well as the motivating-factor provision without reading either as surplusage\n\nis one that restricts the motivating-factor provision’s application to Title VII\n\ndiscrimination claims only.\n\n       Other relevant considerations of statutory construction also weigh in favor of this\n\nCourt’s conclusion that Title VII plaintiffs may not bring motivating-factor retaliation\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\fclaims. For example, Section 102 of the 1991 Act makes clear that if Congress had\n\nwanted to mention motivating-factor claims in Title VII’s retaliation provision, it knew\n\nhow to do so. That Section provides that compensatory and punitive damages are\n\navailable in actions brought under both Title VII’s discrimination provision and its\n\nretaliation provision. “Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a\n\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\n\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russell\n\nv. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because\n\nCongress altered the nature of retaliation claims elsewhere in the 1991 Act, but not in the\n\nmotivating-factor amendment itself, it is proper to assume that the motivating-factor\n\namendment does not apply to retaliation claims.\n\n        Section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) of the 1991 Act provides yet another example. As set\n\nforth above, this provision governs remedies when a plaintiff proves that an\n\nimpermissible factor motivated the decision, but the defendant shows that the illicit factor\n\nwas not the but-for cause of its decision. It also does not mention retaliation. Yet Section\n\n2000e-5(g)(2)(A), the subsection that immediately precedes it, does reference claims\n\nbrought under Title VII’s retaliation provision. See, e.g., Woodson v. Scott Paper Co.,\n\n109 F.3d 913, 934 n.24 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Riess v. Dalton, 845 F.Supp. 742, 744 (S.D.\n\nCal. 1993) (“The fact that Congress expressly treated Section 2000e-3(a) violations in\n\nsuch close proximity to Section 107(b) demonstrates that where Congress intended to\n\naddress retaliation violations, it knew how to do so and did so explicitly.”)). Simply put,\n\nthis Court finds it difficult to believe that the absence of motivating-factor language in\n\nTitle VII’s retaliation provision is the result of accident.\n\n\n\n                                              39\n\f        Finally, under the principle of statutory construction commonly referred to in its\n\nLatin form as inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, Congress precluded its 1991\n\nmotivating-factor amendment’s application to Title VII retaliation claims by expressly\n\ndeclaring that the analysis applies “when the complaining party demonstrates that race,\n\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment\n\npractice, even when other factors motivated the practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m)\n\n(emphasis added). The text of the Act provides the limited universe of factors to which its\n\nanalysis applies, and the Court concludes that Congress precluded its application to any\n\nother factors, including retaliation.\n\n        The 5th Circuit has argued that applying the Gross rules discussed above to Title\n\nVII cases ignores the Supreme Court’s admonition in Gross that courts should be very\n\ncareful when applying rules applicable under one statute to a different statute. See Smith\n\nv. Xerox Corp., 602 F.3d 320 (5th Cir. 2010) (arguing that applying Gross’s reasoning in\n\nthe Title VII context ignores Gross’s admonition). In Smith, Xerox argued that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously instructed the jury on the burden of proof by allowing it to find\n\nfor Smith on her retaliation claim with only “motivating factor” rather than “but-for”\n\ncausation, thereby improperly shifting the ultimate burden of persuasion to Xerox. The\n\n5th Circuit affirmed the district court and held that Title VII’s retaliation provision allows\n\nmixed-motives claims despite the arguments above. In doing so, it “recognize[d] that the\n\nGross reasoning could be applied in a similar manner to the instant case.” Id. at 328. It\n\nalso recognized that “[t]he text of § 2000e-2(m) states only that a plaintiff proves an\n\nunlawful employment practice by showing that ‘race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin was a motivating factor.’ It does not state that retaliation may be shown to be a\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\fmotivating factor.” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m)) (emphasis in original). It even\n\nrecognized that although Congress amended Title VII to add § 2000e-2(m) in 1991, “it\n\ndid not include retaliation in that provision.” Id. Having summarized all of these very\n\npersuasive arguments, the Smith Court said, “These considerations are, of course, similar\n\nto the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Gross, and Xerox understandably urged at oral\n\nargument that Gross dictates the same conclusion here . . . .” Id. Yet, it concluded that\n\n“such a simplified application of Gross is incorrect.” Id.\n\n       The Fifth Circuit’s reasoning rests almost entirely on one argument. Noting that it\n\nwas dealing with a Title VII case—not an ADEA case—the court invoked the Supreme\n\nCourt’s admonition in Gross that courts “must be careful not to apply rules applicable\n\nunder one statute without careful and critical examination,” and held that Price\n\nWaterhouse and the Court’s other Title VII precedents remained its “guiding light.” Id.\n\nThis Court has already explained at length above why it does not believe that Price\n\nWaterhouse applies to this question after Gross. The Court now turns to two reasons it\n\nconcludes that the Smith Court is mistaken.\n\n       First, this Court does not violate the admonition in Gross when it applies Gross’s\n\nteachings on statutory interpretation to the Title VII context. This is because Gross’s\n\nadmonition was limited to the application of rules of law developed under one statute to\n\nanother statute “without careful and critical examination.” Gross, 129 S.Ct at 2349. The\n\n5th Circuit extends this admonition to include not only rules of law but also rules of\n\nstatutory construction. There is a critical difference between a rule of law developed\n\nunder a certain statute and the rules of statutory construction implemented to derive that\n\nrule of law. The former is unique to the statute at issue, but the latter by its very nature\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\fapplies generally. Indeed, the Gross Court’s reasoning itself provides a prime illustration\n\nof this distinction. The Gross Court cited to Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 330 (1997),\n\nfor the proposition that “negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\n\nwhen the provisions were considered simultaneously when the language raising the\n\nimplication was inserted.” 129 S.Ct. at 2349 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is a\n\nrule of statutory construction, but under the 5th Circuit’s logic in Smith, it would be\n\n“contrary to Gross’s admonition against intermingling interpretation of the two statutory\n\nschemes” for the Supreme Court to rely on it because Lindh was an AEDPA—not an\n\nADEA—case. Just as there was nothing improper about the Gross Court relying on\n\nLindh, there is nothing improper about this Court relying on Gross’s teachings on\n\nstatutory construction.\n\n       Second, even if Gross had never been decided, many of the arguments this Court\n\nmade above would still apply. It is not as though Gross was the first case to hold that\n\ncourts should look to the text of a statute when interpreting it. Nor was it the first to\n\nrecognize that when Congress amends one provision of a statute but not another, it can be\n\ninterpreted to have signaled its intention not to apply the amendment to the unaffected\n\nprovision. Moreover, the Gross Court did not closely analyze the precise language of\n\nTitle VII’s retaliation provision—because that provision was not at issue there—but\n\nanalysis of that provision shows that its text plainly indicates its exclusion of motivating-\n\nfactor retaliation cases under the principle of inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.\n\nTherefore, wholly apart from Gross, this Court would find that Title VII does not allow\n\nmotivating-factor retaliation claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\f       For these reasons, this Court holds that—as a matter of law—Hayes may not\n\nbring a motivating-factor retaliation claim under either Price Waterhouse’s burden-\n\nshifting regime or under the motivating-factor provisions of the 1991 Act. Summary\n\njudgment is therefore appropriate as to this aspect of Hayes’s case. Because the Court\n\nconcludes that he may not bring this claim as a matter of law, it declines to address\n\nHHS’s remaining arguments on the matter.\n\n   IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, the Court denies HHS’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment regarding Hayes’s retaliation claim as it applies to HHS’s denial of his\n\napplication to be Deputy Director and grants the Motion in every other respect. A\n\nseparate Order memorializing this Opinion will issue today.\n\n\n\n\n       Date: February 2, 2011                 /s/ Royce C.

Mot. Summ. J., May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48. Having carefully considered\n\ndefendant’s Motion, plaintiff’s Opposition, defendant’s Reply, the entire record in this\n\ncase, and the applicable law, the Court will grant defendant’s Motion in part and deny it\n\nin part. A review of the background of the case, the governing law, the parties’\n\narguments, and the Court’s reasoning in resolving those arguments follows.\n\n    I. Background\n\n             A. Introduction\n\n        J. Blair Hayes brings this lawsuit against the Secretary of the Department of\n\nHealth and Human Services. 1 Suing under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Hayes\n\nalleges that HHS discriminated against him because of his race and retaliated against him\n\n\n1\n  Hayes originally named Michael O. Leavitt in his official capacity as Secretary of HHS as defendant in\nthis case. Complaint 1, January 25, 2008, ECF No. 1. When Kathleen Sebelius took over as Secretary of\nHHS, she simultaneously became the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).\n\n\n                                                    1\n\ffor bringing a discrimination claim. He contends that HHS (1) denied him a Deputy\n\nDirector position on an acting basis; (2) denied him the same Deputy Director position on\n\na permanent basis; (3) lowered his performance appraisals for 2006; (4) lowered his\n\nperformance appraisals for 2007; (5) placed him on a Performance Improvement Plan in\n\n2008; (6) unfairly monitored his job performance; (7) unfairly criticized his job\n\nperformance; and (8) made him perform job duties outside his position description, all\n\nout of illegal discriminatory and retaliatory animus. He also contends that retaliatory\n\nanimus was a “motivating factor” in HHS’s decision to deny him the Permanent Deputy\n\nDirector position. He argues that even if that illicit motive was not the sole or but-for\n\ncause of HHS’s decision, a reasonable jury could still find HHS liable under Title VII.\n\n       HHS responds that many of Hayes’s allegations are not based on employment\n\nactions severe enough to constitute adverse employment actions (or materially adverse\n\nemployment actions in the retaliation context) for Title VII purposes. It further argues\n\nthat its decisions regarding Hayes were based on neither discrimination nor retaliation but\n\nwere instead the result of Hayes’s lack of qualifications relative to Joel Anthony—the\n\nperson ultimately selected as Acting and Permanent Deputy Director—and Hayes’s poor\n\njob performance generally. Finally, HHS contends that Hayes may not, as a matter of\n\nlaw, raise a motivating-factor retaliation claim under Title VII.\n\n            B. The Agency’s Structure\n\n       HHS is the United States government’s principal agency for protecting and\n\npromoting the health of Americans. The Administration for Children and Families is the\n\ncomponent of HHS responsible for federal programs that promote the economic and\n\nsocial well-being of children and families. ACF’s Office of Administration helps it\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fadminister these programs and consists of four divisions: the Office of Grants\n\nManagement, the Office of Financial Services, the Office of Management Resources, and\n\nthe Office of Information Services.\n\n            C. Hayes’s Background\n\n        Hayes, an African American, became ACF’s first-ever Procurement Advisor in\n\nJanuary 2003. Hayes Dep. 48, Aug. 28, 2009, ECF No. 48-3. The GS-15 Step 10 position\n\nwas created especially for him as part of the settlement of an EEO case he filed against\n\nHHS in 2001. Id. at 49–56. Hayes’s primary responsibility was to advise ACF staff on\n\nacquisition issues. Id. at 56–58. Specifically, he was to “[p]rovide[] expert advice and\n\ncounsel to ACF officials on procurement issues, develop[] guidance, [and] ensure[]\n\ncompliance with applicable regulations, rules and policies.” Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4 at ECF\n\np. 2. His duties also included “performing various tasks necessary to analyze, evaluate,\n\nand improve ACF management practices or systems as they relate to acquisition\n\npractices.” Id.\n\n            D. The Acting Deputy Director Position\n\n        Until August of 2006, Hayes’s first-level supervisor was Robert Velasco, the\n\nDeputy Director in the Office of Administration. Hayes Dep. 60–61. His second-level\n\nsupervisor was Curtis Coy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of\n\nAdministration. Coy Dep. 5, 28, Apr. 15, 2009, ECF No. 48-5. After learning that\n\nVelasco was leaving the Office of Administration, Coy looked to fill the Deputy Director\n\nposition on a temporary basis. Id. 64–66. He sought his four Division Directors’ input\n\nand asked each of them whether they had any interest in taking the position. Id. The\n\nDivision Directors at that time were Joel Anthony, Tony Hardy, Cheryl Jones, and\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fMichael Curtis. Id. 53–54. Hardy and Jones are African American, and Anthony and\n\nCurtis are white. Hayes Dep. 90.\n\n          Curtis and Jones expressed no interest in the position. Curtis Dep. 106–07, Apr.\n\n23, 2009; Jones Dep. 93, Apr. 21, 2009. After considering it overnight, Hardy told Coy\n\nthat he “wasn’t really interested in it, but . . . that if asked, [he] would do the deputy\n\nposition.” Hardy Dep. 71, Apr. 27, 2009; Coy Dep. 76–77. Anthony told Coy that “he’d\n\nbe excited to take [the position].” Coy Dep. 75–77. Having gauged his four division\n\ndirectors’ individual interests, Coy met with them about whom to put in the job. Hardy\n\nDep. 74. Ultimately, he made Anthony the Acting Deputy Director. Coy Dep. 80–81.\n\n          Hayes was on a three-week vacation when this selection process took place, Coy\n\nDep. 82–87; Hayes Dep. 92–93, 95–97, and returned to find that Coy had made Anthony\n\nActing Deputy Director while he was away. Hayes Dep. 102. In nearly four years in the\n\noffice, Hayes never once expressed any interest in the Deputy Director post. Hayes Dep.\n\n93, 95–98. But upon learning of Coy’s decision, he let Coy know for the first time that he\n\nwould have been interested in it. Id. at 102–03. Although he would not have received any\n\nextra compensation for filling the Acting Deputy Director position, he desired it because\n\nhe saw it as a “possible stepping stone to a SES [Senior Executive Service] position.” Id.\n\nat 101.\n\n              E. The Permanent Deputy Director Position\n\n          Coy began looking to fill the Deputy Director position permanently in December\n\n2006. Statement Undisputed Facts Support Mot. Summ. J. 7, May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48-\n\n2. He was under no obligation to send out a solicitation of interest and could have simply\n\nmade Anthony the Deputy Director unilaterally and without any extra process. Coy Dep.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f122–24.

J. 7. In the end, only Hayes and Anthony applied. Coy Dep. at\n\n127; Ivery Dep. 84–86.\n\n       Hayes does not dispute that Anthony was the better-qualified candidate. Anthony\n\nhad worked in grants policy, management positions, and the President’s Management\n\nAgenda. Anthony Aff. at ECF pp. 5–6, November 5, 2007, ECF No. 55-15. Having\n\nbegun his federal career in 1974, Anthony had managed several of ACF’s grants-related\n\noffices as well as the development of its Grants Administration Policy Manual in 1995.\n\nId. at ECF p. 5. He managed several “operations” offices—the offices that award and\n\nadminister contracts and grants—as well as “policy” offices. Id. This experience was of\n\nparticular importance to the Deputy Director position because ACF is a grant-making\n\nagency with a $48 billion grants budget, and nearly every one of its significant initiatives\n\ninvolves grants and grants management. Id.\n\n       With nearly twenty-five years’ experience as a federal supervisor performing the\n\nentire array of supervisory responsibilities, Anthony had managed several large financial\n\nmanagement organizations, including one with 60 employees. Id. at ECF pp. 5–6.\n\nAnthony’s experience did not go unnoticed. He received the highest possible\n\nperformance rating—Outstanding—the past ten years in a row. Id. at ECF p. 6. In 2001,\n\nhe received the ACF Distinguished Achievement Award, and in 2004, he received the\n\nhighest honor bestowed on managers at ACF—the ACF Honor Award for Exemplary\n\nLeadership. Id. Hayes, while rated Excellent several times, never received a single\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fOutstanding rating and garnered no similar awards recognizing any significant leadership\n\nqualities. Hayes Dep. 223.\n\n       Hayes did not have any functional responsibilities within the Office of\n\nAdministration’s four divisions. Coy Decl. ¶ 4, May 10, 2010, ECF No. 55-11. He had\n\nnever been a grants officer, had never assigned or awarded a grant, had never been\n\nresponsible for administering a grant, had never received training in administering a\n\ngrant, and he did not have any level of certification in the grants certification process.\n\nHayes Dep. 141–43. He also had no responsibility for information technology or\n\nmanagement resources. Id. 12–48. Finally, Hayes did not supervise any employees from\n\n2003–2006. Id. at 60; Coy Decl. ¶ 3. From 1997–2001, he had supervised a staff of 14\n\npeople, and in the 1980s he supervised a staff of four. Statement Undisputed Facts\n\nSupport Mot. Summ. J. 8. In fact, another reason Hayes was interested in the position\n\nwas that he saw it as a chance to be a supervisor again. Hayes Dep. 101.\n\n       Coy had a panel interview both candidates. Coy Dep. 127–28. The panel\n\nconsisted of Coy, Segundo Pereira—the Director of Diversity Management and the\n\nActing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Policy at HHS—and Diane Dawson.\n\nDawson, an African American, is the Director of ACF’s Office of Regional Operations.\n\nId.; see also Dawson Dep. 13, 22–23, Apr. 21, 2009, ECF No. 48-10; Pereira Dep. 13–14,\n\n26, Apr. 23, 2009, ECF No. 48-11; Hayes Dep. at 124–25. The panel interviewed the\n\ncandidates one after the other, asking them the same questions. Pereira Dep. 34, 42;\n\nDawson Dep. 33; Coy Dep. 133–34.\n\n       The panel interviewed Hayes first. Pereira Dep. 45; Dawson Dep. 33. Despite\n\nhaving not interviewed in fifteen years, Hayes did nothing to prepare for the interview\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fother than review his application. Hayes Dep. 122–23. He was “surprised” by the\n\nquestions at the interview, which included “what would you do in your first thirty days on\n\nthe job,” id. at 128–29, and acknowledged that he had no “concrete” ideas about “what\n\n[he] wanted to do as Deputy Director.” Id. 130–31. He also expressed no substantive\n\nthoughts on what challenges faced the Deputy Director or what the Deputy Director’s\n\npriorities should be. Id. at 134–35. Anthony, on the other hand, appeared prepared for the\n\ninterview and provided much more comprehensive answers to the panel’s questions.\n\nPereira Dep. at 72; Dawson Dep. 51–53. His answers reflected the breadth of his\n\nexperience at HHS, including his extensive work on grants and acquisition matters.\n\nDawson Dep. 51–53.\n\n       After discussing the candidates, all three panel members concluded that Anthony\n\nwas clearly the better candidate. Pereira Dep. 69, 73–74; Dawson Dep. 56; Coy Dep.\n\n135–36. Pereira testified that Hayes’s interview was “the model of how not to interview.”\n\nPereira Dep. 80. Coy found that “it was apparent . . . that Mr. Anthony had prepared for\n\nthe interview, [and that he] had answers that were cogent and thoughtful and Mr. Hayes\n\nwas not so much.” Coy Dep. 136. Dawson said that “Mr. Hayes’s responses were much\n\nmore narrow and sort of not clearly, in [her] opinion, understanding the scope and the\n\nbreadth of the functions that were in that office, compared to Anthony who seemed to\n\nknow a lot about—a lot of different areas.” Dawson Dep. 53. Based on the unanimous\n\nrecommendation of the panel members, Coy selected Anthony to be Deputy Director.\n\nCoy Dep. 135–36.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f            F. Performance Appraisals\n\n       Hayes received annual performance appraisals as procurement advisor. Hayes\n\nDep. 222–23. He received a rating of Excellent for 2003, 2004, and 2005. Id. For each of\n\nthese reviews, Velasco rated his performance. Statement Undisputed Facts Support Mot.\n\nSumm. J. 11. In September 2006, before he left the Office of Administration, Velasco\n\ngave Hayes a summary rating of Excellent. Id. In December 2006, Anthony prepared his\n\n“final rating,” and said, “The Summary Rating prepared by Robert Velasco on September\n\n6, 2006 will be the final rating of record for Mr. Hayes. For the past couple of months,\n\nmy observation of his performance is consistent with the summary rating. His final rating\n\nof record is Excellent.” Id. at 11–12. Coy did not change the rating Velasco and Anthony\n\ngave Hayes. Id. at 12. Notably, Velasco gave summary ratings to all of the employees\n\nunder his supervision before he left the office. Anthony Dep. 158–59. Neither Anthony\n\nnor Coy changed any of these ratings. Id.\n\n       Hayes refused to sign his 2006 performance rating, something he had not done in\n\nprior years. Id.; Hayes Dep. 184–85. He wrote, “I refuse to sign the evaluation. I feel this\n\nrating is not accurate and Mr. Anthony has intentionally rated me below the rating I\n\ndeserve.” Hayes Dep. 185. He believed he should have received an Outstanding rating\n\nbecause Coy cited his projects in a September 29, 2006, e-mail thanking the Office of\n\nAdministration for their “contributions over the past year.” Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2 at ECF\n\np. 8, May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48-17.\n\n       Coy and Anthony observed a steady decline in Hayes’s job performance in 2007.\n\nCoy Aff. ¶ 7, May 10, 2010, ECF No. 48-7; Anthony Aff. ¶ 15, April 23, 2010, ECF No.\n\n48-9. They rated his performance on four individual performance outcomes and one\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fadministrative requirement. Statement Undisputed Facts Support Mot. Summ. J. 17. The\n\nfirst individual performance outcome was based on Hayes’s proactively working toward\n\nHHS’s procurement consolidation efforts, communicating information to Office of\n\nAdministration staff on procurement policies and procedures, and analyzing new or\n\nproposed procurement legislation, regulations, and testimony to determine their impact\n\non ACF. Id. They rated Hayes Minimally Successful on this requirement because his\n\nefforts regarding procurement consolidation were neither proactive nor effective. Id. He\n\nalso failed to communicate information to ACF staff on new or revised federal and HHS\n\nprocurement policies and procedures, including analyzing new or proposed procurement\n\nlegislation to determine its impact on ACF programs. Id. In fact, he failed to provide any\n\nanalysis of the numerous 2007 federal acquisition circulars. Id.\n\n       The second individual performance outcome required Hayes to assist the Deputy\n\nSecretary and Deputy Director in fulfilling their management priorities and to provide\n\noversight of the issuance of ACF credit cards, including maintaining information on the\n\ncard holders and approvers. Id. They rated him Minimally Successful on this requirement\n\nbecause he provided neither Anthony nor Coy with useful reports on the status of ACF\n\nprocurement matters during the year. Id. He also failed to have much, if any, involvement\n\nin the ACF credit card program. Id.\n\n       The third individual performance outcome required Hayes to assist ACF\n\ncustomers in choosing efficient and effective procurement strategies. Id. at 18. Anthony\n\nand Coy rated Hayes Fully Successful on this requirement. Id.\n\n       The fourth individual performance outcome required Hayes to provide oversight\n\nfor the Procurement Tracking System. Id. They rated Hayes Minimally Successful on this\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\frequirement because it was unclear to Anthony and Coy that Hayes had done anything\n\nwith respect to the Procurement Tracking System. Id. He did not provide them with\n\nuseful reports regarding the system, and he did not take any action to ensure that the\n\nsystem’s information on ACF’s intranet was current. Id. As far as Anthony could tell,\n\nnothing new on the system had been added to ACF’s intranet that year. Id.\n\n       The administrative requirement called on Hayes to identify and communicate his\n\nindividual developmental needs and to work with his supervisors to establish a\n\nperformance plan for the year. Id. Coy and Anthony rated Hayes Minimally Successful\n\non this requirement because he failed during 2007 to work with his supervisors on\n\nestablishing a performance plan and failed to provide them with self-assessments. Id. On\n\nJune 18, 2007, Anthony asked Hayes to provide him with comments regarding his\n\nperformance for the year so that they could be incorporated into his mid-year progress\n\nreview. Id. Hayes did not respond. Id. at 19. On December 5, 2007, Anthony asked Hayes\n\nto provide him with a description of his accomplishments during the year so that they\n\ncould be reflected in his final performance rating. Id. Hayes did not respond. Id. On\n\nDecember 14, 2007, Anthony reiterated his request for information about Hayes’s\n\naccomplishments during the year, but Hayes, again, failed to respond. Id. Hayes also did\n\nnot identify any developmental needs that he had as Procurement Advisor. Id.\n\n       Based on the ratings Hayes received on the individual performance outcomes and\n\nthe administrative requirement, his overall performance rating for 2007 was Minimally\n\nSuccessful. Id. This was the first rating Hayes received under the new four-tier rating\n\nsystem. Coy Aff. ¶ 7, May 10, 2010, ECF No. 48-7 (noting that the ratings available were\n\nExceptional, Fully Successful, Minimally Successful, and Unacceptable). Hayes believed\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fhe should have been rated Exceptional but provided no information to Anthony or Coy\n\nexplaining the basis for his belief. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 9 at ECF pp. 59–60.\n\n         On February 4, 2008, Anthony and Coy gave Hayes a workplan that set forth\n\nspecific expectations of him for the year. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4 at ECF pp. 62–65. Coy\n\nalso met with him that afternoon to go over the workplan. Id. Their hope was that, in light\n\nof Hayes’s 2007 Minimally Successful rating, the workplan would ensure the “new\n\nperformance period [would] begin with [Hayes having] a clear understanding of what\n\n[was] expected of [him] in 2008.” Id.\n\n            G. The Performance Improvement Plan\n\n         By April 4, 2008, though, Anthony and Coy had determined that Hayes’s\n\nperformance was not improving. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 11 at ECF p. 67. Coy provided him\n\nwith a “Performance Update” memorandum that described the deficiencies in his\n\nperformance. Id. He was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan, or PIP, on April\n\n22, 2008. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 12 at ECF p. 80. The PIP did not affect his pay, job title,\n\nwork hours, or responsibilities, but it did state that if Hayes did not improve his\n\nperformance he could be terminated. Id. at ECF p. 88. Ultimately, though, no action was\n\ntaken against him, and he remains procurement advisor with the same pay and hours\n\ntoday.\n\n   II. Legal Standard\n\n         A. Summary Judgment\n\n         Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, the discovery and\n\ndisclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fCiv. P. 56(c). This standard requires more than the mere existence of some factual\n\ndispute between the parties to defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for\n\nsummary judgment; “the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1986) (emphasis in original). A material\n\nfact is one that, under the substantive law applicable to the case, is capable of affecting\n\nthe outcome of the litigation. Id. An issue is genuine where the “evidence is such that a\n\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,” as opposed to evidence\n\nthat is “so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Id. at 248, 252. The\n\nnonmoving party’s evidence is to be believed, and all reasonable inferences from the\n\nrecord are to be drawn in that party’s favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S\n\n242, 255 (1986).\n\n       B. Title VII\n\n       Title VII of the Civil Rights Act provides that employment decisions by federal\n\nemployers must be “made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). It also prohibits retaliation against any\n\nemployee because she “has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any\n\nmanner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-3(a).\n\n       The Court considers Hayes’s claims of discrimination and retaliation under the\n\ntraditional Mcdonnell Douglas framework.

First, the plaintiff must prove a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation. Id. at 802. To show a prima facie case of discrimination, a\n\nplaintiff must show that “(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fadverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of\n\ndiscrimination.” Stella v.

Cir. 1999)). A prima facie case of retaliation, similarly,\n\nrequires a plaintiff to establish “(1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2)\n\nthat he suffered a materially adverse action by his employer; and (3) that a causal link\n\nconnects the two.” Wiley v. Glassman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187050\"><a href=\"/opinion/187050/wiley-v-glassman/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155 (D.C. Cir. 2007). If the plaintiff\n\nproves a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S.\n\nat 802–04. Finally, if the defendant satisfies its burden, the plaintiff must prove that the\n\ndefendant’s stated reason is pretext for discrimination. Id. at 804–05.\n\n        In Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, the Court of Appeals simplified the\n\ndistrict courts’ analysis in most Title VII discrimination suits. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187112\"><a href=\"/opinion/187112/brady-v-office-of-sergeant-at-arms/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2008); see also Jones v.

It did so out of a recognition that “[i]n\n\nmost employment discrimination cases that reach federal court, there is no dispute that\n\nthe employee has suffered an adverse employment action.” Baloch v. Kempthorne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187264\"><a href=\"/opinion/187264/baloch-v-kempthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Thus, because the prima facie\n\ndetermination had become a “largely unnecessary sideshow,” the Court held that in Title\n\nVII disparate-treatment suits, the district court need not determine if the plaintiff makes\n\nout a prima facie case of discrimination once the defendant has asserted a legitimate,\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for the challenged actions. Brady, 520 F.3d at 494. As a\n\nresult, the district court will usually be left with “one central question: Has the employee\n\nproduced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fnon-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against the employee on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin?” Id. In other words, the Court must determine if the plaintiff has produced enough\n\nevidence such that a reasonable jury could find that the defendant’s non-discriminatory\n\nreasons are mere pretext for the underlying unlawful discrimination.\n\n       Despite Brady’s admonition that district courts should not pause to examine\n\nwhether a plaintiff established a prima facie case when an employer offers a legitimate\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for its actions, HHS argues that many of the alleged adverse\n\nactions Hayes identifies are not sufficiently serious to support a discrimination or\n\nretaliation claim under Title VII. Therefore, the Court first considers whether the asserted\n\nemployment actions are sufficiently adverse to constitute adverse employment actions (or\n\nmaterially adverse employment actions in the retaliation context) under Title VII. See\n\nBaloch v. Kempthorne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187264\"><a href=\"/opinion/187264/baloch-v-kempthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (proceeding directly to the\n\nBrady analysis may be premature, and courts should first assess whether there is evidence\n\nof an adverse action where that fact is contested). Assuming they are, the Court will then\n\nconsider whether there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that HHS’s\n\nproffered non-discriminatory reason for taking those actions is actually pretext to cover\n\nup underlying discrimination or retaliation.\n\n        The prima facie case standards for Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims\n\nboth contain the term “adverse action,” but “the concept [] in the retaliation context is\n\nbroader than in the discrimination context, and can encompass harms unrelated to\n\nemployment or the workplace ‘so long as a reasonable employee would have found the\n\nchallenged action materially adverse.’” Franklin v. Potter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2380300\"><a href=\"/opinion/2380300/franklin-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

For an employment action to be\n\nadverse in the discrimination context, it must result in “materially adverse consequences\n\naffecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or future employment\n\nopportunities such that a reasonable trier of fact could find objectively tangible harm.”\n\nForkkio v. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185794\"><a href=\"/opinion/185794/forkkio-samuel-e-v-powell-donald/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1131 (D.C.

Accordingly, an adverse\n\nemployment action is defined as “a significant change in employment status, such as\n\nhiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.” Id. at 552 (internal\n\ncitation and quotation omitted). Alleged acts of discrimination that do not constitute\n\nadverse employment actions cannot serve as the basis for a Title VII action.

Courts\n\nin this Circuit have interpreted Rule 7(b) to mean that when a plaintiff files an opposition\n\nto a dispositive motion that addresses only certain arguments the defendant raises, a court\n\nmay treat those arguments the plaintiff fails to address as conceded.

Accordingly, because Hayes had the opportunity to\n\nrespond to all of the challenges to his claims, the Court will construe his failure to\n\nrespond to several of those challenges as a concession that HHS should prevail on them.\n\n       Specifically, Hayes does not respond to HHS’s challenges to five of his claims:\n\n(1) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by placing Anthony in the Acting\n\nDeputy Director position; (2) that his 2006 performance appraisal shows discrimination\n\nand retaliation; (3) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by monitoring his\n\nwork; (4) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by criticizing his work; and\n\n(5) that Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by giving him duties outside of his\n\nposition description. With that much of the underbrush cleared, three claims remain: (1)\n\nthat Coy discriminated and retaliated against him by placing Anthony in the Permanent\n\nDeputy Director position; (2) that his 2007 performance appraisal shows retaliation; and\n\n(3) that his placement on the PIP was both discriminatory and retaliatory. The Court will\n\naddress each of the remaining claims in turn.\n\n                                              16\n\f       A. Permanent Deputy Director Position\n\n                   1. HHS has produced admissible evidence to show that Coy\n                      believed Anthony was more qualified than Hayes for the\n                      Deputy Director position.\n\n       Hayes claims that Coy’s failure to select him for the Permanent Deputy Director\n\nposition was discriminatory and retaliatory. Coy responds that neither a retaliatory nor a\n\ndiscriminatory animus tainted his motivations in making the decision to hire Anthony for\n\nthe position. Instead, he puts forward a legitimate justification for the decision, namely\n\nthat Hayes was far less qualified for the position than Anthony. The question before the\n\nCourt, then, is whether Hayes has put forward sufficient evidence for a jury to be able to\n\ninfer reasonably that Coy’s explanation is pretext to cover up his true discriminatory or\n\nretaliatory motives.\n\n       Hayes does not dispute that Anthony was actually more qualified than he was for\n\nthe position. Instead, Hayes argues that “[b]ecause Defendant’s brief does not support his\n\nalleged reason with admissible evidence, it is insufficient to defeat the inference of\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation raised by plaintiff’s prima facie case.” Opp’n Mot. Summ.\n\nJ. 19, October 5, 2010, ECF No. 55. The brunt of Hayes’s argument is that Coy must\n\nshow that he—Coy himself—honestly believed that Anthony’s qualifications were better.\n\nTherefore, evidence like Anthony’s Affidavit or his resume will not suffice.\n\n       Hayes is correct that what matters is Coy’s honest belief about Hayes’s and\n\nAnthony’s relative qualifications and not what those qualifications actually are or what a\n\nreasonable person would think they are.

Cir. 1998) (concluding that\n\nwhere it was unclear that a supervisor was aware of one aspect of the plaintiff’s\n\nexperience, the court would not rely on that aspect of his qualifications when deciding\n\nsummary judgment based on the supervisor’s contention that he legitimately chose\n\nsomeone over the defendant because of their superior qualifications). The problem is that\n\nthere is admissible evidence that Coy considered Anthony more qualified. For instance, at\n\nhis deposition, Coy said that it was apparent at the interview that Anthony “had answers\n\nthat were cogent and thoughtful and Hayes was not so much.” Coy Dep. 135–36.\n\nMoreover, when specifically asked during the administrative process why he selected\n\nAnthony for the Deputy Director position, Coy said:\n\n       Mr. Anthony was prepared for the interview and came with specific\n       answers to questions. His last number of evaluations were Outstanding\n       and his resume provided a long list of awards and qualifications. He is and\n       was a current supervisor and has been continuously for several years. Mr.\n       Anthony is a seasoned and highly thought of manager well versed in\n       almost all of the issues that the Office of Administration deals with. His\n       grants, financial management, policy, and management experience made\n       him an excellent candidate. Mr. Hayes’ response to the Solicitation of\n       Interest indicated a finite level of interaction with senior level managers\n       within ACF, the Department, and other federal government agencies. His\n       resume indicated that his leadership skills and experience was leading a\n       team of contractors to develop and teach staff on how to use the\n       Procurement Tracking System, his last supervisory role was in January\n       2001. Mr. Hayes last several evaluations assessed him by the previous\n       Deputy as Excellent. He did not appear to be prepared for the interview\n       process.\n\nMot. Summ. J. Ex. 14 at ECF p. 7, May 24, 2010, ECF No. 48 (submitted with the Reply\n\nin Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment). Finally, beyond explicitly stating that\n\nhe chose Anthony because of his superior qualifications, Coy was clearly aware of their\n\nrelative qualifications from having supervised both of them. Coy supervised Anthony for\n\nseveral years in his role as a Division Director in the Office of Administration, indicating\n\n                                             18\n\fintimate knowledge of Anthony’s job duties. Anthony Dep. 12–13, Apr. 20, 2009, ECF\n\nNo. 48-8. He also signed all of Anthony’s performance appraisals during this time period,\n\nindicating awareness of Anthony’s performance over a long period of time. Mot. Summ.\n\nJ. Ex. 15 at ECF p. 16. Furthermore, Anthony submitted a resume to Coy as part of his\n\napplication for the Deputy Director position. Id. at ECF pp. 18–19; Coy Dep. 127. That\n\nresume outlined his superior qualifications, including having “[m]anaged every Financial\n\nManagement Function in ACF, including Division of Discretionary Grants, Division of\n\nGrants Policy, Division of Acquisition Management, and Office of Financial Services.”\n\nId. He would have also, therefore, known that Anthony had “unlimited signature\n\nauthority” as a “Contracting Officer” and a “Grants Officer,” and that he had “[d]irect\n\nand substantial experience managing all types of Federal financial assistance—\n\ndiscretionary, block, formula, and entitlement grants.” Id. Finally, Coy watched both\n\nHayes and Anthony interview and was able to compare their abilities to prove their\n\nqualifications on an even playing field, back to back, with two outside opinions to ensure\n\nfairness.\n\n        Hayes points to one portion of Coy’s Declaration that he claims shows that “Coy\n\ndid not even say, even summarily, that he selected Anthony because his qualifications\n\nwere superior.” Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 19–20. Pointing out that this one section from\n\nCoy’s Declaration does not contain the magic words, “I chose Anthony because he was\n\nmore qualified than Hayes for the position,” does not in any way prove that Coy did not\n\nchoose Anthony for that reason. Indeed, as discussed above, when asked point-blank why\n\nhe chose Anthony, Coy explained how Anthony was better-qualified in detail, displaying\n\nhis intimate knowledge of both candidates’ qualifications and his own reasonable\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fassessment of Anthony’s as better for the Deputy Director position than Hayes’s.\n\nTherefore, Hayes’s argument that HHS has not produced admissible evidence to support\n\nits legitimate explanation for choosing Anthony over him for the Deputy Director\n\nposition fails.\n\n                   2. Hayes raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether\n                      Coy’s contention that he chose Anthony for Deputy Director is\n                      pretext to cover up a retaliatory motive.\n\n        Hayes proceeds to argue that even if this Court decides that Coy has met his\n\nburden of putting forward a neutral, nondiscriminatory, nonretaliatory justification for\n\nplacing Anthony instead of him in the Deputy Director position, the record contains\n\nsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Coy’s proffered reason is mere\n\npretext. Mot. Summ. J. 21. The Court considers each of Hayes’s five arguments in turn.\n\n        First, he argues that “[w]hile Coy and the other two members of the selection\n\npanel claim that there was ‘unanimous’ or ‘mutual’ agreement as to the reasons Anthony\n\nwas to be chosen over Hayes, their accounts of this supposed agreement are inconsistent\n\nwith one another.” Id. Such inconsistency, Hayes argues, would allow a reasonable jury\n\nto infer a discriminatory and retaliatory motive on the part of the employer. Id. (citations\n\nomitted). This argument is unpersuasive because HHS never claimed that the panel\n\nmembers were unanimous in their reasons for choosing Anthony. Rather, it claims that\n\nthe panel members were unanimous in their ultimate decision to choose Anthony over\n\nHayes, and there is clearly more than enough evidence to prove that. See Dawson Dep. 50\n\n(“Q. And you thought Anthony was the better candidate? A. I did. Q. Because he had a\n\nbroader scope to his answers to the questions? A. That’s one reason, yes.”); Pereira Dep.\n\n69 (“But we have two candidates, and of the two, [Anthony] is by far the better\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\fcandidates, based on the answer that he provided during the interview.”); id. at 73–74\n\n(“Q. And the interview for him took 30 to 40 minutes also? A. yes. Q. Good. And all\n\nthree of you had the same conclusion? A. Yes.”); Coy Dep. 135–36 (Q. And what was\n\nyour decision? A. Well, after discussing it with the panel it was unanimous. Q. It was\n\nunanimous. In other words, the panel’s view was unanimous? A. Yes. Q. That Joel\n\nAnthony should be the Deputy, right? A. Yes.”). Thus, the agreement that all three\n\npanelists reference is an agreement that Anthony should be selected for the position, not\n\nthat all three have precisely the same reasons for drawing that conclusion.\n\n       One reason for having a panel interview is to get different points of view. If three\n\npeople all have different, but valid, reasons for choosing Anthony over Hayes, then Coy\n\ncan feel that much more comfortable about making that selection. If everyone thought\n\nabout hiring issues and viewed candidates in precisely the same way, little could be\n\ngained by having a panel interview. Thus, it would be unsurprising if the panelists did not\n\nhave precisely the same reasons for choosing Anthony. That said, contrary to Hayes’s\n\ncontention, the panelists actually did agree—by and large—in their reasons for selecting\n\nAnthony over Hayes. Dawson testified as follows:\n\n       Q. And you thought Anthony was the better candidate?\n\n       A. I did.\n\n       Q. Because he had a broader scope to his answers to the questions?\n\n       A. That’s one reason, yes.\n\n       Q. And Mr. Hayes was more narrow to his role in the Office of Administration?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fDawson Dep. at 50. She went on to testify that: “I believe, in terms of the two—\n\ncomparing the two interviewees, that Mr. Hayes’ responses were much more narrow and\n\nsort of not clearly, in my opinion, understanding the scope and the breadth of the\n\nfunctions that were in that office, compared to—Anthony who seemed to know a lot\n\nabout—a lot of different areas.” Id. at 53.\n\n        Pereira also explained his specific reasons for recommending that Anthony be\n\nselected. He said that Anthony’s answers to the interview questions “were more\n\ncomprehensive” than Hayes’s. (Pereira Dep. at 69–73). He went on to explain that Hayes\n\ndid not “seem to be taking [the interview] seriously,” id. at 64, and that he was staring at\n\nthe ceiling during the portions of the interview. Id. at 80–81. Thus, Pereira believed that\n\n“based on the answers that he provided during the interview,” Anthony was “by far the\n\nbetter candidate.” Id. at 69.\n\n        Coy also testified to the same effect, saying, “[I]t was apparent . . . that Mr.\n\nAnthony had prepared for the interview, [and that he] had answers that were more cogent\n\nand thoughtful and Mr. Hayes was not so much.” Coy Dep. 136; see also Mot. Summ. J.\n\nEx. 14 at ECF p. 7 (“Mr Anthony was prepared for the interview and came with specific\n\nanswers to questions.”) (submitted with the Reply in Support of the Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment). Accordingly, Hayes’s first argument is unpersuasive.\n\n        Hayes’s second argument is that a reasonable juror could conclude that Coy did\n\nnot have sufficient information to honestly believe that Anthony’s qualifications were\n\nbetter than Hayes’s. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 23–25. He says that Coy admitted at his\n\ndeposition that he had little or no knowledge of either Hayes’s or Anthony’s\n\nqualifications and that therefore a reasonable jury could find that he did not honestly\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\fselect Anthony based on qualifications. Id. at 25. As an example, Hayes points out that\n\nCoy did not have knowledge of Anthony’s supervisory duties in his position prior to\n\ncoming to the Office of Administration. Id. at 23–24 (citing Coy Dep. 25–26). But the\n\npassages Hayes cites do not support his argument. Coy was asked questions during his\n\ndeposition regarding his knowledge of Anthony’s and Hayes’s qualifications upon\n\nassuming the Deputy Assistant Secretary position in 2002. At that time, Coy did not\n\nknow either of them well. Coy Dep. 188–89. In working with the two of them for several\n\nintervening years, however, and in filling the Deputy Director position, Coy learned each\n\nof their respective qualifications well, as discussed above.\n\n       Third, Hayes argues that a reasonable jury might find Coy’s argument pretext\n\nbecause on the one hand, he stressed the crucial role Anthony’s grants experience played\n\nin his decision, but on the other, he hired Velasco—a non-African American who had not\n\nengaged in EEO activity—as his Deputy Director even though he had no grants\n\nexperience whatsoever. Id. at 25. This argument might be persuasive if the Velasco\n\ndecision and the Anthony decision were the same except for the prior EEO activity and\n\nrace of the applicants. But that is not the case. Instead, Hayes presents no evidence that\n\nCoy chose Velasco over a similarly situated candidate with grants experience. In fact, he\n\ndoes not even show that Coy had the option of choosing a candidate with grants\n\nexperience when he made the Velasco decision. The Anthony decision was different in\n\nthat Coy had one applicant with a great deal of important grants experience and another\n\ncandidate with none. Moreover, Coy testified that there were other reasons for choosing\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fAnthony as well. This argument, then, fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact. 2\n\n        Fourth, Hayes argues a reasonable jury could conclude that Coy lied about having\n\nconvened the interview panel in order to ensure that “everything was fair and above\n\nboard transparent.” Id. at 25–26. He says that Pereira and Dawson both claimed that\n\nCoy’s method of interviewing the candidates was out of the ordinary and notes that the\n\npanelists came into the interview with very little information about the candidates or the\n\nposition for which they were applying. Id. at 25. Therefore, the argument goes, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that “Coy failed to give the panel and Hayes information\n\nabout the position to give Anthony a competitive advantage in the selection process,”\n\nbecause Anthony was the Acting Deputy Director for several months leading up to the\n\ninterviews and would know the position better. Id.\n\n        There are two problems with Hayes’s argument. First, Coy was not required to\n\ngive out any more information than he did. Indeed, Hayes points to no evidence that Coy\n\nwas required to conduct an interview at all. Second, as to the allegation that Anthony had\n\na leg up because he was Acting Deputy Director, that may be true, but if it is, it is only\n\nbecause he was actually better-qualified. Experience in the position being interviewed for\n\nis a legitimate and valuable qualification to have coming into an interview—assuming\n\none has done a decent job in the position, as Anthony apparently had. But that does not\n\nmean that Coy “rigged” things for Anthony. Any advantage Anthony had, even under\n\nHayes’s argument, was directly linked to his superior qualifications.\n\n        Fifth, Hayes argues that the record contains evidence of Coy’s retaliatory attitude\n\nupon which a reasonable jury could infer that his true reason for not selecting Hayes for\n\n2\n  The same can be said for Hayes’s argument that Coy did not know that Velasco had supervisory\nexperience and yet he contends that Anthony’s supervisory experience was very important to his decision.\nId.\n\n                                                   24\n\fthe Deputy Director position was retaliatory animus. Id. at 27. He points to three\n\nexamples to justify his claim. First, at his deposition, Coy was asked, “You looked into\n\n[Hayes’s] background, however, didn’t you? . . . You’re a careful manager. You got a\n\nnew staff advisor. You wanted to know what he knew and what his experience was,\n\ndidn’t you? . . . .” Id. (citing Coy Dep. 189–90). Coy responded, “I didn’t look into Mr.\n\nHayes’ background . . . It was a result of an EEO settlement. He didn’t get put here\n\nbecause of any merit. It was because of an EEO settlement.” Id. Second, he points to\n\nCoy’s reaction to another employee’s successful EEO case. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 28.\n\nCoy said that the verdict “ha[d] shaken [him] in a way that other significant events in\n\n[his] recent past haven’t done.” Id. It was also evident to his staff that Coy was “very\n\nupset” by the verdict. Id. (citing Anthony Dep. 137). Third, Rhett Leverett, the EEO\n\ncounselor who interviewed Coy regarding Hayes’s complaint, testified as follows:\n\n       Mr. Coy was a bit agitated, perhaps angry. He was not happy about this\n       case was my feeling that I got from the phone conversation. He was\n       somewhat hostile. He did not enjoy talking to me. He was angry that Mr.\n       Hayes had brought the case, and he said to me while he’s carrying on,\n       “Mr. Leverett, it is morally repugnant,” and he said it with great\n       conviction that he brought this case. And he goes, “I want you to put that\n       in the report.” He ordered me to state that directly. I’ve never had a\n       manager do that in 200 cases. And I said, “Yes, sir.” . . . . He specifically\n       directed me to put that statement in the report, because he was so upset\n       that Mr. Hayes brought this case. That was a direct quote at his request in\n       a kind of nasty way . . . . I have never had anyone demand that before that\n       I put their quote in the report, because he was not happy, and he conveyed\n       that to me from the very beginning of the phone conversation to the end\n       that he did not like this.\n\nOpp’n Mot. Summ. J. 29 (citing Leverett Dep. 20–21, Apr. 28, 2009, ECF No. 55-8). The\n\nEEO counselor further testified that he believed Coy was angered that Hayes had charged\n\nhim with discrimination in the past and that he was hostile toward Hayes because of the\n\ncharge. Levertt Dep. 21. The Court will analyze each of these statements in some detail.\n\n                                             25\n\f        First, Coy said, “He didn’t get put here because of any merit. It was because of an\n\nEEO settlement.” Coy Dep. 189–90. Analyzing this statement in isolation, Coy does not\n\ncommit himself to any view of Hayes’s merit. It is technically possible, for example, that\n\nCoy believed that Hayes had infinite merit; he just did not believe that Hayes became\n\nprocurement advisor because of it. It is also logically possible, if one analyzes this\n\nstatement in isolation, that Coy thought Hayes has absolutely no merit at all; again, his\n\nmerit did not play a factor in his acquisition of the procurement advisor position.\n\n        But Coy did not make this statement in isolation. It arose in the context of lengthy\n\ndeposition questioning regarding whether he had—at any point—looked into Hayes’s\n\nbackground:\n\n        Q. You’re a careful manager. You got a new staff advisor. You wanted to\n        know what he knew and what his experience was, didn’t you? A. I didn’t\n        look into Mr. Hayes’ background. Q. Didn’t inquire as to what he had\n        done before so you knew what you could rely on his advice on\n        procurement? You, the careful new head of the Office of Administration\n        here at ACF, didn’t do it? A. It was the result of an EEO settlement. He\n        didn’t get put here because of any merit. It was because of an EEO\n        settlement.\n\n\nCoy Dep. 189. Given this context, a reasonable jury could conclude that Hayes’s EEO\n\nsettlement served as justification—in Coy’s mind—for not taking a serious look at\n\nHayes’s qualifications as he considered whom to put in the Deputy Director position. If\n\nthe jury drew such an inference, then it would appear that Coy viewed Hayes’s EEO\n\nsettlement as a badge of inferiority that justified giving his qualifications short-shrift in\n\nfuture employment decisions.\n\n        The second statement has to do with Coy’s displeasure at having lost a prior EEO\n\ncase. This statement has no direct connection to Hayes’s EEO activity in this case, and\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fthus, it could not raise a genuine issue of material fact on its own. Yet, a reasonable jury\n\ncould conclude from this statement that Coy is hostile to EEO activity in general, making\n\nit more likely than it would be in the absence of this evidence that he chose Anthony\n\ninstead of Hayes in order to retaliate against Hayes for filing an EEO complaint after\n\nbeing passed over for consideration for the Acting Deputy Director position.\n\n       The third statement, which arose during Coy’s interview with Leverett, tends to\n\nshow how much Hayes’s EEO complaint upset Coy. Although it is understandable that\n\naccusations of discrimination would upset an employer, Coy’s comments here go beyond\n\nthat normal displeasure for two reasons. First, his reaction was so extreme that Leverett\n\nsaid he had never seen anything like it in over 200 EEO cases. It was enough to cause the\n\nEEO counselor to conclude that Coy was hostile toward Hayes because of the charge.\n\nLeverett Dep. 21. Second, Coy found Hayes’s complaint “morally repugnant.” Id. It is\n\none thing to find an accusation of discrimination upsetting. It is quite another to claim\n\nthat an employee’s participation in the EEO process is morally repugnant. Therefore, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that Coy did not give Hayes a fair shake in the Deputy\n\nDirector selection process because Coy could not see past what he considered to be the\n\nmoral repugnancy of Hayes’s EEO activities.\n\n       Coy argues that some of these statements are insufficient to raise an inference of\n\nretaliation because they concern things that happened years before the selection decision\n\nat issue. That argument falls short. The Supreme Court has held that where the inference\n\nof retaliation hinges exclusively on the temporal proximity of the protected activity and\n\nthe adverse action, they must have occurred “very close” in time to one another. Clark\n\nCounty School Dist. v. Breeden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620700\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620700/clark-county-school-dist-v-breeden/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273–74 (2001) (“The cases that accept\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fmere temporal proximity between an employer’s knowledge of protected activity and an\n\nadverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie\n\ncase uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be ‘very close.’”) (citations\n\nomitted). Here, though, the inference springs not from the temporal proximity of\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action but instead from Coy’s own words, their hostile\n\ntone, and their precise application to the very EEO activity that Hayes took in this case.\n\n       A reasonable jury could, therefore, conclude that Coy’s explanation that he chose\n\nAnthony because he was better-qualified is pretext to cover up his underlying hostility\n\ntoward Hayes’s EEO activity. For that reason, the Court will deny HHS’s Motion with\n\nregard to this aspect of Hayes’s claim.\n\n       B. Minimally Successful Performance Rating in 2007 and PIP Placement\n\n       Next, Hayes argues that Coy and Anthony attempted to falsely characterize\n\nAnthony as Hayes’s supervisor to insulate Coy—who has previously been found guilty of\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation by a jury—from another discrimination and retaliation\n\nallegation. EEOC v. C.G. Schmidt, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2407379\"><a href=\"/opinion/2407379/eeoc-v-cg-schmidt-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Wis. 2009)\n\n(holding that concealing the involvement of a decision maker who responded to\n\nplaintiff’s earlier EEO complaint in retaliation case supported an inference of retaliatory\n\nmotive). It is true that Anthony admits in his Affidavit that he was Hayes’s supervisor “in\n\nname only.” Anthony Aff. 3. Then at his Deposition, Anthony says that Coy “made it\n\nclear” that he would be required to supervise Hayes as Deputy Director. Anthony Dep.\n\n110–11. Hayes claims that these inconsistent statements were meant to cover up Coy’s\n\ninvolvement in putting him on the PIP and giving him a Minimally Successful rating in\n\n2007. Opp’n Mot. Summ.

In other words, Hayes may not avoid summary\n\njudgment simply by finding any inconsistency in Anthony’s or Coy’s testimony; he must\n\nshow that the inconsistency could give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination or\n\nretaliation. Other evidence makes clear, however, that no such cover-up was going on.\n\n       First, regarding the PIP, because Hayes has not shown that his placement on it\n\n“affected [his] grade or salary” or that it constituted a “significant change in employment\n\nstatus,” it is not an adverse employment action capable of supporting a discrimination\n\nclaim.

To sustain a retaliation\n\nclaim, however, he need only raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his\n\nplacement on the PIP would have “dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or\n\nsupporting a charge of discrimination.” Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry.

Id. Later, in the\n\nsame opinion, the Kelly Court holds that PIP placement can constitute a materially\n\nadverse employment action even without grade or salary consequences. Id. at 225 (citing\n\nRochon v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186601\"><a href=\"/opinion/186601/rochon-donald-v-gonzales-alberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Thus, the Court concludes\n\nthat Hayes’s PIP placement could dissuade a reasonable employee from pursuing a\n\ndiscrimination claim, and it will therefore consider Hayes’s arguments on that score.\n\n       The record shows that Coy ultimately decided to place Hayes on the PIP, and Coy\n\nsigned the PIP. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 12 at ECF p. 80. These undisputed facts contradict\n\nHayes’s allegation that Coy sought to cover up his involvement with the PIP placement to\n\nconceal his retaliatory motives. The record is similarly clear regarding Hayes’s\n\nMinimally Successful rating. Coy signed it personally—an action totally inconsistent\n\nwith the theory that he sought to cover up his involvement in the rating. Mot Summ. J.\n\nEx. 4 at ECF p. 72.\n\n       Moreover, there is evidence in the record that Anthony did act as Hayes’s\n\nsupervisor in more than name only. In March 2007, Coy told Hayes that “all\n\ncorrespondence/emails concerning job assignments you are working on should either be\n\nrouted through Joel [Anthony] as he is the Deputy and your direct supervisor – or at a\n\nminimum, he should be cc’d.” Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 17 at ECF p. 14. Hayes followed that\n\ninstruction, and Anthony provided supervisory feedback to him. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4 at\n\nECF pp. 76–78. These actions show that Anthony was Hayes’s supervisor in more than\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fname only and that Coy was not trying to cover up his own involvement in Hayes’s\n\nMinimally Successful rating.\n\n       Next, Hayes argues that a reasonable jury could conclude that Coy’s inability—at\n\nhis 2009 deposition—to recall the reasons Hayes was placed on the PIP and given a\n\nMinimally Successful performance rating in 2007 would allow a reasonable jury to\n\nconclude that Coy’s proffered reasons are pretext to disguise a retaliatory motive for the\n\nactions. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 32–33. The fact that Coy cannot recall those details years\n\nlater does not show that they were not his reasons at the time he made the decisions at\n\nissue, though. In fact, as was discussed at length above, the record is replete with\n\ncontemporaneous documentation of precisely why Hayes was rated Minimally Successful\n\nand placed on the PIP. The Court will therefore grant HHS’s Motion with respect to\n\nHayes’s PIP placement and Minimally Successful rating claims.\n\n       C. Motivating-Factor Retaliation Claim\n\n       Whether Hayes intended it or not, the two paragraphs he tacked on to the end of\n\nhis Opposition to Summary Judgment articulating a “motivating factor” retaliation\n\nclaim—innocent though they may appear—present a complicated issue. The D.C. Circuit\n\nhas twice grappled with motivating-factor retaliation claims, and yet a question remains\n\nunanswered in the Circuit: Does Title VII currently permit a motivating-factor retaliation\n\nclaim? Hayes raises this claim for the first time in his Opposition, and HHS has several\n\nresponses. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that, as a matter of law, Hayes\n\nmay not bring such a claim.\n\n           1. The Statute, Price Waterhouse, and the 1991 Act\n\n\n       Title VII’s discrimination provision provides in relevant part:\n\n\n                                             31\n\f       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer—\n\n       (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual with respect to\n           his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n           because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n           origin; or\n       (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n           employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n           individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n           his status as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n           religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). And the Act’s retaliation provision provides:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\n       discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment,\n       for an agency, or joint labor-management committee controlling\n       apprenticeship or other training or retraining programs, to discriminate\n       against any individual, or for a labor organization to discriminate against\n       any member thereof or applicant for membership, because he has opposed\n       any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or\n       because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any\n       manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). In 1989, a plurality of the Supreme Court—in the context of a\n\nTitle VII discrimination case—held that once a “plaintiff proves that [the plaintiff’s\n\nmembership in a protected class] played a motivating part in an employment decision, the\n\ndefendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [that factor]\n\ninto account.” Price Waterhouse v.

The 1991 Act added a\n\nprovision to Title VII that explicitly provides for employer liability based on evidence\n\nthat an impermissible consideration was “a motivating factor” in the employer’s decision:\n\n       [A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining\n       party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a\n       motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors\n       also motivated the practice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m). While codifying Price Waterhouse’s recognition of liability in\n\nmixed-motives cases, this new provision also overruled one of that case’s central\n\nholdings by limiting the employer’s exposure to certain remedies. This aspect of the Act\n\nhas come to be called the “same action” affirmative defense:\n\n       On a claim in which an individual proves a violation under section 2000e-\n       2(m) of this title and a respondent demonstrates that the respondent would\n       have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating\n       factor, the court-\n       (i)      may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief . . ., and attorney’s\n                fees and costs . . .; and\n       (ii)     shall not award damages or issue an order requiring any admission,\n                reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment . . . .\nId. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Thus the 1991 Act’s motivating-factor framework allows\n\nemployees to establish a Title VII violation under § 2000e-2(m) “without proving that an\n\nimpermissible consideration was the sole or but-for motive for the employment action,\n\nwhile providing the employer with a ‘limited affirmative defense’ under § 2000e-\n\n5(g)(2)(B) ‘that does not absolve it of liability, but restricts the remedies available to a\n\nplaintiff.’” Porter, 414 F.3d at 19 (citing Desert Palace, 539 U.S. at 94). This limited\n\naffirmative defense abrogated the portion of Price Waterhouse that provided a complete\n\n                                              33\n\fdefense in cases where an employer who shows that the illicit motive was not the but-for\n\ncause of the employment decision. Both Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Amendments,\n\nhowever, dealt only with Title VII discrimination claims.\n\n           2. The D.C. Circuit recognizes that, in light of the 1991 Act, it is now an\n              open question whether Title VII plaintiffs may bring mixed-motives\n              retaliation claims under Price Waterhouse or motivating-factor\n              retaliation claims under the 1991 Act.\n       The above discussion makes clear that, following the 1991 Amendments, mixed-\n\nmotives discrimination cases are subject to the Act’s motivating-factor analysis, and not\n\nto Price Waterhouse’s burden-shifting regime. An open question remains, however, as to\n\nwhat analysis, if any, is proper in the context of mixed-motives retaliation claims. As\n\ndiscussed above, the D.C. Circuit previously extended the Price Waterhouse framework\n\nto retaliation claims, but it has subsequently expressed concern that the 1991 Act may\n\ncall the legitimacy of this prior extension into question.

Five years later, the Court of Appeals\n\nreiterated that courts need to examine the 1991 Amendments to determine whether or not\n\nthe Act’s motivating factor analysis should apply with equal force to the retaliation\n\ncontext, but it did not mention whether Price Waterhouse’s relevance was still in\n\nquestion.

In sum, it appears there are two open questions. First, does the 1991 Act allow\n\nTitle VII motivating-factor retaliation claims? Second, if it does not, may Title VII\n\nplaintiffs still bring mixed-motives retaliation claims under Price Waterhouse?\n\nThankfully, the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Gross v. FBL Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145857\"><a href=\"/opinion/145857/gross-v-fbl-financial-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), provides a clear answer to both of these vexatious questions.\n\n             3. The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Gross v. FBL Services, Inc.,\n                resolves any doubt: Title VII plaintiffs may bring neither mixed-\n                motives retaliation claims under Price Waterhouse nor motivating-\n                factor retaliation claims under the 1991 Act.\n         Although it was an ADEA case, the Supreme Court in Gross construed text that is\n\nin relevant part identical to the language of Title VII at issue here. Specifically, the\n\nADEA provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or\n\nto discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect\n\nto his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such\n\nindividual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). This language is\n\nindistinguishable from Title VII’s discrimination and retaliation provisions, both of\n\nwhich contain the same “because of” formulation. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall\n\nbe an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to\n\ndischarge any individual . . . because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\n\nnational origin . . . .”) (emphasis added); id. at 2000e-3(a) (“It shall be an unlawful\n\nemployment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or\n\napplicants for employment . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful\n\nemployment practice by this subchapter . . . .”) (emphasis added). 3\n\n\n3\n The Court recognizes that, technically speaking, “because of” and “because” are not exactly the same\nphrasing. The Court finds, however, that syntactical differences in the respective provisions, rather than\nany substantive difference in meaning, account for the slight variation here.\n\n                                                     35\n\f       In Price Waterhouse, the Supreme Court interpreted “because of” in Title VII’s\n\ndiscrimination provision and held that “[t]o construe the words ‘because of’ as colloquial\n\nshorthand for ‘but-for causation,’ . . . is to misunderstand them.” Price Waterhouse, 490\n\nU.S. at 240 (citations omitted) (going on to hold that the “because of” language allowed\n\nplaintiffs to prove Title VII liability merely by showing that their employer’s adverse\n\naction against them was brought about in part by an illegal motive). The Supreme\n\nCourt’s recent decision in Gross, however, makes clear that Price Waterhouse’s\n\ninterpretation of “because of” is flatly incorrect. As an initial matter, the Gross Court\n\nfocused on the proper meaning of this phrase to determine whether a mixed-motives jury\n\ninstruction like the one permitted under Price Waterhouse was available under the\n\nADEA. Gross, 129 S.Ct. at 2350 (“Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the\n\nADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does\n\nnot.”). It concluded that “because of” in the ADEA means “by reason of,” and thus an\n\nADEA “plaintiff must prove that age was the ‘but-for’ cause of the employer’s adverse\n\ndecision.” Id. (emphasis added). Moreover, in reaching this decision, the Gross Court\n\ncalled Price Waterhouse’s reasoning into question, announcing that “it is far from clear\n\nthat the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question [of Price\n\nWaterhouse’s mixed-motives burden-shifting framework] today in the first instance.” Id.\n\nat 2351–52 (citations omitted). It went on to question Price Waterhouse’s wisdom\n\nfurther, noting that “it has become evident in the years since [Price Waterhouse] was\n\ndecided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply.” Id. at 2351. The Court\n\nconcluded that “the problems associated with Price Waterhouse have eliminated any\n\nperceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims.” Id. For these same\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\freasons, as well as the D.C. Circuit’s prior recognition that the 1991 Act calls Price\n\nWaterhouse’s continued viability into question, this Court will not apply that opinion’s\n\ninterpretation of “because of” to Title VII’s retaliation provision. 4\n\n        Having foreclosed Price Waterhouse’s application to Title VII’s retaliation\n\nprovision in light of the Gross Court’s criticisms, this Court now turns to whether the\n\n1991 Act provides an independent basis for a motivating-factor retaliation claim. Relying\n\non the Gross Court’s other reasons for not permitting such a claim under the ADEA, this\n\nCourt concludes that Title VII, after the 1991 Act, does not permit plaintiffs to bring\n\nmotivating-factor retaliation claims.\n\n        A central basis for the Gross Court’s holding was Congress’s decision to\n\nexplicitly provide for motivating-factor discrimination claims under Title VII in the 1991\n\nAct while making no similar provision for such claims under the ADEA. As the Court\n\nexplained, “[w]hen Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is\n\npresumed to have acted intentionally.” Id. at 2349 (citations omitted).The Court noted\n\nthat Congress’s inaction was especially important here because it considered and\n\namended both statutes at the same time but chose to provide for motivating-factor claims\n\nunder one and not the other. Id. (“[N]egative implications raised by disparate provisions\n\nare strongest when the provisions were considered simultaneously when the language\n\nraising the implication was inserted.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In\n\nthe case currently before the Court, Congress made changes to various parts of Title VII\n\naffecting both discrimination and retaliation claims. When it came to crafting the\n\nmotivating-factor analysis, however, it amended one section of Title VII and was silent\n\n4\n  It bears noting that the Gross Court had no occasion to overrule Price Waterhouse even if it was so\ninclined because Price Waterhouse was a Title VII case—not an ADEA case like Gross. Thus, the fact that\nthe Court called Price Waterhouse into question takes on greater than normal significance.\n\n                                                  37\n\fas to another provision of Title VII. Thus, the inference that Congress considered both\n\nprovisions and was therefore intentional in its disparate application of the motivating-\n\nfactor provision applies with even greater force here.\n\n       The Gross Court also held that Title VII’s structure made clear that the 1991\n\nmotivating-factor amendment only applies to Title VII’s discrimination provision. It\n\npointed out that Congress’s 1991 amendment to Title VII not only explicitly added\n\nmotivating-factor liability to Title VII, but also eliminated the employer’s complete\n\naffirmative defense to motivating-factor claims. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). “If such\n\n‘motivating factor’ claims were already part of Title VII,” the Court explained, “the\n\naddition of § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) alone would have been sufficient.” Id. at 2352 n.5. The\n\nCourt thus concluded that “Congress’s careful tailoring of the ‘motivating factor’ claim in\n\nTitle VII, as well as the absence of a provision parallel to § 20003-e2(m) in the ADEA,\n\nconfirms that we cannot transfer the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework into\n\nthe ADEA.” Id. This argument applies with even greater force to the case currently\n\nbefore the Court, and Congress’s 1991 motivating-factor amendment to Title VII must\n\napply only to discrimination claims. Otherwise, as the Gross Court explained, Section\n\n2000e-5(g)(2)(B) would have been sufficient on its own to make the adjustment Congress\n\nallegedly intended. Thus, the only construction that gives meaning both to Section 2000e-\n\n5(g)(2)(B) as well as the motivating-factor provision without reading either as surplusage\n\nis one that restricts the motivating-factor provision’s application to Title VII\n\ndiscrimination claims only.\n\n       Other relevant considerations of statutory construction also weigh in favor of this\n\nCourt’s conclusion that Title VII plaintiffs may not bring motivating-factor retaliation\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\fclaims. For example, Section 102 of the 1991 Act makes clear that if Congress had\n\nwanted to mention motivating-factor claims in Title VII’s retaliation provision, it knew\n\nhow to do so. That Section provides that compensatory and punitive damages are\n\navailable in actions brought under both Title VII’s discrimination provision and its\n\nretaliation provision. “Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a\n\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\n\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russell\n\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because\n\nCongress altered the nature of retaliation claims elsewhere in the 1991 Act, but not in the\n\nmotivating-factor amendment itself, it is proper to assume that the motivating-factor\n\namendment does not apply to retaliation claims.\n\n        Section 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) of the 1991 Act provides yet another example. As set\n\nforth above, this provision governs remedies when a plaintiff proves that an\n\nimpermissible factor motivated the decision, but the defendant shows that the illicit factor\n\nwas not the but-for cause of its decision. It also does not mention retaliation. Yet Section\n\n2000e-5(g)(2)(A), the subsection that immediately precedes it, does reference claims\n\nbrought under Title VII’s retaliation provision. See, e.g., Woodson v. Scott Paper Co.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738512\"><a href=\"/opinion/738512/james-w-woodson-v-scott-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934 n.24 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Riess v.

Simply put,\n\nthis Court finds it difficult to believe that the absence of motivating-factor language in\n\nTitle VII’s retaliation provision is the result of accident.\n\n\n\n                                              39\n\f        Finally, under the principle of statutory construction commonly referred to in its\n\nLatin form as inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, Congress precluded its 1991\n\nmotivating-factor amendment’s application to Title VII retaliation claims by expressly\n\ndeclaring that the analysis applies “when the complaining party demonstrates that race,\n\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment\n\npractice, even when other factors motivated the practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m)\n\n(emphasis added). The text of the Act provides the limited universe of factors to which its\n\nanalysis applies, and the Court concludes that Congress precluded its application to any\n\nother factors, including retaliation.\n\n        The 5th Circuit has argued that applying the Gross rules discussed above to Title\n\nVII cases ignores the Supreme Court’s admonition in Gross that courts should be very\n\ncareful when applying rules applicable under one statute to a different statute. See Smith\n\nv. Xerox Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71475\"><a href=\"/opinion/71475/smith-v-xerox-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2010) (arguing that applying Gross’s reasoning in\n\nthe Title VII context ignores Gross’s admonition). In Smith, Xerox argued that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously instructed the jury on the burden of proof by allowing it to find\n\nfor Smith on her retaliation claim with only “motivating factor” rather than “but-for”\n\ncausation, thereby improperly shifting the ultimate burden of persuasion to Xerox. The\n\n5th Circuit affirmed the district court and held that Title VII’s retaliation provision allows\n\nmixed-motives claims despite the arguments above. In doing so, it “recognize[d] that the\n\nGross reasoning could be applied in a similar manner to the instant case.” Id. at 328. It\n\nalso recognized that “[t]he text of § 2000e-2(m) states only that a plaintiff proves an\n\nunlawful employment practice by showing that ‘race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin was a motivating factor.’ It does not state that retaliation may be shown to be a\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\fmotivating factor.” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m)) (emphasis in original). It even\n\nrecognized that although Congress amended Title VII to add § 2000e-2(m) in 1991, “it\n\ndid not include retaliation in that provision.” Id. Having summarized all of these very\n\npersuasive arguments, the Smith Court said, “These considerations are, of course, similar\n\nto the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Gross, and Xerox understandably urged at oral\n\nargument that Gross dictates the same conclusion here . . . .” Id. Yet, it concluded that\n\n“such a simplified application of Gross is incorrect.” Id.\n\n       The Fifth Circuit’s reasoning rests almost entirely on one argument. Noting that it\n\nwas dealing with a Title VII case—not an ADEA case—the court invoked the Supreme\n\nCourt’s admonition in Gross that courts “must be careful not to apply rules applicable\n\nunder one statute without careful and critical examination,” and held that Price\n\nWaterhouse and the Court’s other Title VII precedents remained its “guiding light.” Id.\n\nThis Court has already explained at length above why it does not believe that Price\n\nWaterhouse applies to this question after Gross. The Court now turns to two reasons it\n\nconcludes that the Smith Court is mistaken.\n\n       First, this Court does not violate the admonition in Gross when it applies Gross’s\n\nteachings on statutory interpretation to the Title VII context. This is because Gross’s\n\nadmonition was limited to the application of rules of law developed under one statute to\n\nanother statute “without careful and critical examination.” Gross, 129 S.Ct at 2349. The\n\n5th Circuit extends this admonition to include not only rules of law but also rules of\n\nstatutory construction. There is a critical difference between a rule of law developed\n\nunder a certain statute and the rules of statutory construction implemented to derive that\n\nrule of law. The former is unique to the statute at issue, but the latter by its very nature\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\fapplies generally. Indeed, the Gross Court’s reasoning itself provides a prime illustration\n\nof this distinction. The Gross Court cited to Lindh v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118135\"><a href=\"/opinion/118135/lindh-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (1997),\n\nfor the proposition that “negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\n\nwhen the provisions were considered simultaneously when the language raising the\n\nimplication was inserted.” 129 S.Ct. at 2349 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is a\n\nrule of statutory construction, but under the 5th Circuit’s logic in Smith, it would be\n\n“contrary to Gross’s admonition against intermingling interpretation of the two statutory\n\nschemes” for the Supreme Court to rely on it because Lindh was an AEDPA—not an\n\nADEA—case. Just as there was nothing improper about the Gross Court relying on\n\nLindh, there is nothing improper about this Court relying on Gross’s teachings on\n\nstatutory construction.\n\n       Second, even if Gross had never been decided, many of the arguments this Court\n\nmade above would still apply. It is not as though Gross was the first case to hold that\n\ncourts should look to the text of a statute when interpreting it. Nor was it the first to\n\nrecognize that when Congress amends one provision of a statute but not another, it can be\n\ninterpreted to have signaled its intention not to apply the amendment to the unaffected\n\nprovision. Moreover, the Gross Court did not closely analyze the precise language of\n\nTitle VII’s retaliation provision—because that provision was not at issue there—but\n\nanalysis of that provision shows that its text plainly indicates its exclusion of motivating-\n\nfactor retaliation cases under the principle of inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.\n\nTherefore, wholly apart from Gross, this Court would find that Title VII does not allow\n\nmotivating-factor retaliation claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\f       For these reasons, this Court holds that—as a matter of law—Hayes may not\n\nbring a motivating-factor retaliation claim under either Price Waterhouse’s burden-\n\nshifting regime or under the motivating-factor provisions of the 1991 Act. Summary\n\njudgment is therefore appropriate as to this aspect of Hayes’s case. Because the Court\n\nconcludes that he may not bring this claim as a matter of law, it declines to address\n\nHHS’s remaining arguments on the matter.\n\n   IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, the Court denies HHS’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment regarding Hayes’s retaliation claim as it applies to HHS’s denial of his\n\napplication to be Deputy Director and grants the Motion in every other respect. A\n\nseparate Order memorializing this Opinion will issue today.\n\n\n\n\n       Date: February 2, 2011                 /s/ Royce C.
