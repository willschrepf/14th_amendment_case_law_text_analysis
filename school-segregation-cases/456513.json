Cordant Technologies, Inc., 316 F.3d 1137, 1138\n\n(10th Cir. 2003), w e affirm for the reasons discussed below. 2\n\n      Plaintiff is a black male who was employed by the school district from\n\n1980 to 1996 as a physical education teacher and, for some of that time, as a\n\nbasketball coach. During that period, he received a number of critical teacher\n\nevaluations, was transferred from coaching girls’ basketball based on a report of\n\ninappropriate conduct, and was discharged as a boys’ coach due to performance\n\nissues. He sued the school district for race discrimination and retaliation in 1991.\n\nThe suit failed and he was ordered to pay attorney fees. He continued teaching in\n\nthe school district until 1996, when he relocated to Texas.\n\n      He later returned to Kansas and on June 20, 2000, submitted an application\n\nfor teaching and coaching jobs to the school district. The school district’s human\n\nresources manager, Lynn King, interviewed plaintiff in August 2001. After the\n\ninterview, M s. King sent a letter to plaintiff relating the superintendent’s decision\n\n\n1\n      The parties consented to disposition of the case by a magistrate judge\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n2\n      After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to grant the parties’ request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthat, due to his past employment record with the school district, he “will not be\n\nconsidered for rehire by this district.” Appellant’s Appendix (A pp.) I at 124.\n\nThe letter concluded with this clarifying admonition: “This letter should end any\n\nuncertainty regarding your status with the [school district].” Id. W hile plaintiff\n\nquestioned the basis for the decision, he admitted that “after receiving this\n\n[letter]” he “knew that they were saying they w[ould] not hire [him].” A pp. II\n\nat 285 (B rown deposition pages 130, 132).\n\n      In M arch 2002, plaintiff filed an EEOC charge over the school district’s\n\nrefusal to rehire him. See App. II at 321. He did not, however, pursue the matter\n\nupon receipt of a right-to-sue letter in April 2002. See id. at 320.\n\n      Plaintiff continued an aggressive correspondence with the school district\n\nover his unsuccessful application, but the school district did not relent. As the\n\ndistrict court noted, plaintiff was repeatedly told that he would not be considered\n\nfor re-employment by the school district. See, e.g., id. at 437, 438. A letter sent\n\nby M s. King to plaintiff in January 2003 concluded by saying: “I don’t know\n\nwhat additional words to use to make the point more clear, you will not be rehired\n\nby the school district.” Id. at 438.\n\n      Finally, on M ay 23, 2003, M s. King sent plaintiff the letter that became the\n\nbasis of a second EEOC charge and, ultimately, this case. See id. at 311 (EEOC\n\ncharge citing M ay 23 letter); id. at 511 n.4 (district court order noting plaintiff’s\n\nreliance on M ay 23 letter as only discrete act of discrimination); see also Br. of\n\n                                           -3-\n\fAplt. at 8-9. In the letter, she reiterated the school district’s refusal to consider\n\nplaintiff for any position and directed him to “re-read the volume of previous\n\nresponses to you on the subject of your rehire by the school district.” Id. at 439.\n\nPlaintiff filed his associated charge with the EEOC on August 1, 2003. He was\n\nsent a right-to-sue letter on M arch 31, 2004, id. at 312, and filed this action on\n\nJune 18, 2004, asserting claims of race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\nand race discrimination and retaliation under Title VII.\n\n                          U ntimeliness of Title VII Claims\n\n      There are two limitations provisions that together fix the time frame for\n\nbringing suit under Title VII. First, the claimant must timely seek administrative\n\nrelief. “In a deferral state such as K ansas, a Title VII claimant must file his\n\ndiscrimination charge within 300 days of the alleged unlawful act.” Peterson v.\n\nCity of Wichita, 888 F.2d 1307, 1308 (10th Cir. 1989) (applying 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-5(e)(1)); see also Davidson v. Am. Online, Inc., 337 F.3d 1179, 1183 &\n\nn.1 (10th Cir. 2003). Second, the claimant must timely pursue legal action upon\n\nconclusion of the administrative proceedings. “Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)\n\na com plainant has ninety days in which to file suit after receipt of an EEOC\n\nright-to-sue letter.” Witt v. Roadway Express, 136 F.3d 1424, 1429 (10th Cir.\n\n1998). If the claimant fails to file suit within the ninety-day window, the lapsed\n\nclaims are not revived by including them in a second EEOC charge and restarting\n\nthe process. See, e.g., Spears v. M o. Dep’t of Corr. & Hum an Res., 210 F.3d 850,\n\n                                           -4-\n\f853 (8th Cir. 2000); Soso Liang Lo v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 787 F.2d\n\n827, 828 (2d Cir. 1986); Price v. Greenspan, 374 F. Supp. 2d 177, 184\n\n(D.D.C. 2005).\n\n      Plaintiff’s administrative charge and subsequent suit based on the school\n\ndistrict’s M ay 23, 2003 letter facially satisfied the time limitations summarized\n\nabove. However, the district court noted that the letter simply restated the school\n\ndistrict’s unconditional decision, first related to plaintiff in August 2001, refusing\n\nto consider him for rehire in light of his past employment record. Thus, relying\n\non the non-revival rule cited above, the district court held that the operative\n\nlimitations period commenced and expired long before this action was filed.\n\nPlaintiff challenges that decision, arguing that the M ay 23, 2003 letter was a\n\ndiscrete act of discrimination/retaliation actionable independently of the school\n\ndistrict’s prior refusal to rehire him.\n\n      The circumstances and briefing in this case suggest two polarized positions,\n\nneither of which, in its extreme form, seems fully satisfactory: (1) an employer\n\nmay unilaterally impose a once-and-for-all condition on a claimant’s right to seek\n\nredress for discrimination in hiring (or promotion, etc.) that could ultimately\n\ninvolve the denial, over an extended time period, of multiple job opportunities,\n\nversus (2) the claimant can perpetually revive an otherwise expired claim of\n\ndiscrimination by repeatedly applying for additional positions. W e need not\n\nchoose between these stark alternatives here, however, as the particular claim\n\n                                          -5-\n\fpursued by plaintiff falls in the middle ground between them. Before explaining\n\nour resolution of this case, we review some pertinent background principles that\n\nare clearly established in the case law.\n\n      First, “[e]ach discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges\n\nalleging that act.” Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. M organ, 536 U.S. 101, 113\n\n(2002). Thus, “discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even\n\nwhen they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.” Id.\n\n      Second, in determining when the limitation period comm ences, “the proper\n\nfocus is upon the time of the discrim inatory acts, not upon the time at which the\n\nconsequences of the acts became most painful.” Del. State Coll. v. Ricks,\n\n449 U.S. 250, 258 (1980) (quotation omitted). Thus, when an initial\n\ndiscriminatory act is time-barred, a later related event is not actionable if it is\n\nmerely a consequence of the first; to be actionable, the later event must involve\n\nan independent act of discrimination (which in certain circumstances may be\n\ninherent in the event, but otherwise requires explicit supporting allegations).\n\nCom pare id. at 257-58 (holding claim time-barred because alleged discrimination\n\noccurred w hen plaintiff w as denied tenure, not when he w as later terminated as a\n\nresult) with Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 394-97 & n.6 (1986) (holding\n\ndisparate-pay claim timely, despite genesis of disparity in segregation long since\n\nabandoned, because “[e]ach week’s paycheck that delivers less to a black than to\n\na similarly situated white is [inherently] a wrong actionable under Title VII”).\n\n                                           -6-\n\fIn the same vein, a time-barred act cannot supply the requisite discriminatory\n\nanimus for an otherw ise neutral act within the limitations period. See United\n\nAir Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 557-58 (1977) (rejecting claim by rehired\n\nemployee for allegedly wrongful denial of seniority for years spent outside\n\nworkforce following resignation under admittedly discriminatory marriage\n\nprohibition, because seniority scheme was facially neutral and discrimination\n\nassociated with resignation was outside limitations period).\n\n      Complementing the above two principles is a third that is especially\n\npertinent here. W hile a time-barred discriminatory act will not make actionable\n\n(or be made actionable by) its later facially neutral consequences, such an act will\n\nnot preclude an action for subsequent related acts that would support suit on their\n\nown. “The existence of past acts and the employer’s prior knowledge of their\n\noccurrence . . . does not bar employees from filing charges about related discrete\n\nacts so long as the acts are independently discriminatory and charges addressing\n\nthose acts are themselves timely filed.” M organ, 536 U.S. at 113. The Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Bazemore, noted above, illustrates this point in holding pay\n\ndisparities based on race actionable (with each pay check) even though they were\n\nrelated to historical segregation practices not subject to suit.\n\n      Plaintiff contends that his case falls within the scope of this last principle.\n\nBased on his administrative charge and the pleadings and pretrial order herein,\n\nwe disagree. Plaintiff did not assert and offer a supporting factual basis for a\n\n                                          -7-\n\fclaim that the school district’s letter of M ay 23, 2003 reflected an independent act\n\nof discrimination/retaliation in hiring. Neither the charge, complaint, nor pretrial\n\norder referred to any position that plaintiff had applied for and been denied, for\n\nprohibited reasons, by that letter. See App. I at 11, 29, 126. Rather, consistent\n\nwith its content, which just referred back to past correspondence, the letter was\n\nalleged to be w rongful because it reflected a continuation of the district’s\n\npreviously stated refusal to consider plaintiff for work based on his employment\n\nhistory. Id. To the extent this broadly stated decision was itself actionable,\n\ndistinct from any independently discriminatory/retaliatory refusal to rehire\n\nplaintiff for a particular job, the time for suit had clearly expired and, under the\n\nauthority discussed above, was not revived by plaintiff’s repeated attempts to\n\nrevisit the matter.\n\n      None of the arguments advanced by plaintiff overcome this basic deficiency\n\nin his case. In particular, he contends that his copious correspondence with the\n\nschool district over the broad decision it made in 2001 should be deemed a series\n\nof discrete job applications and that the school district’s reaffirmations of that\n\ndecision should be deemed a series of discrete (and independently discriminatory\n\nor retaliatory) decisions denying each application, the last of which, the letter of\n\nM ay 23, 2003, would not be time-barred. But that is simply not the charge he\n\npursued administratively and the claim he pled in the district court, which fix the\n\nscope of the case properly before us. Those remedial efforts were directed at the\n\n                                          -8-\n\fschool district’s broad decision in August 2001 as reaffirmed, in equally broad\n\nterms, in M ay 2003, not at any particular, independently discriminatory hiring\n\ndecision.\n\n      Thus, as noted earlier, we have no occasion to decide whether the school\n\ndistrict’s once-and-for-all refusal to consider plaintiff for employment established\n\na single immutable accrual date for all failure-to-hire claims or, conversely, that\n\nthe intended effect of the unconditional refusal was rendered meaningless by\n\nsubsequent application(s) for employment that it w as intended to foreclose.\n\nW e hold only that an employer’s mere reiteration of a broad decision not to\n\nconsider an applicant for any employment does not revive expired objections\n\nregarding its initial statement of that decision.\n\n                            Untimeliness of § 1981 Claim\n\n      The forum state’s statute of limitations for personal injury actions governs\n\ncivil rights claims under both 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and § 1983. Scheerer v. Rose\n\nState C oll., 950 F.2d 661, 664 (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Goodman v. Lukens Steel\n\nCo., 482 U.S. 656, 660-62 (1987), for § 1981, 3 and Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S.\n\n261, 276-80 (1985), superseded by statute on other grounds, as stated in Jones v.\n\n\n\n3\n      W e note that 28 U.S.C. § 1658 now provides a federal four-year limitations\nperiod for statutory causes of action created after December 31, 1990, but this\nprovision has no application to discrimination claims under § 1981 involving the\nformation of employment contracts (i.e., failure to hire), which were actionable\nbefore the specified date. Cross v. The Home Depot, 390 F.3d 1283, 1288\n(10th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                          -9-\n\fR.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U .S. 369, 377-78 (2004), for § 1983). In Kansas,\n\nthat is the two-year statute of limitations in Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-513(a). Hamilton\n\nv. City of Overland Park, 730 F.2d 613, 614 (10th Cir. 1984) (en banc).\n\n      Here, that two-year period, like the Title VII limitations period, does not\n\nreach back to the August 27, 2001 letter first stating the school district’s refusal\n\nto consider plaintiff for rehire, but does cover the M ay 23, 2003 letter reiterating\n\nthat position. Thus, as the district court tacitly held and both parties explicitly\n\nconcede, the limitations issue under § 1981 clearly turns on the same accrual\n\nanalysis controlling our disposition of the Title VII claims. See Br. of Aplt. at 13;\n\nBr. of Aplee. at 26. Accordingly, for the reasons explained above in connection\n\nwith the latter, we also hold that plaintiff’s § 1981 claim was properly dismissed\n\nas time-barred.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f",

The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthat, due to his past employment record with the school district, he “will not be\n\nconsidered for rehire by this district.” Appellant’s Appendix (A pp.) I at 124.\n\nThe letter concluded with this clarifying admonition: “This letter should end any\n\nuncertainty regarding your status with the [school district].” Id. W hile plaintiff\n\nquestioned the basis for the decision, he admitted that “after receiving this\n\n[letter]” he “knew that they were saying they w[ould] not hire [him].” A pp. II\n\nat 285 (B rown deposition pages 130, 132).\n\n      In M arch 2002, plaintiff filed an EEOC charge over the school district’s\n\nrefusal to rehire him. See App. II at 321. He did not, however, pursue the matter\n\nupon receipt of a right-to-sue letter in April 2002. See id. at 320.\n\n      Plaintiff continued an aggressive correspondence with the school district\n\nover his unsuccessful application, but the school district did not relent. As the\n\ndistrict court noted, plaintiff was repeatedly told that he would not be considered\n\nfor re-employment by the school district. See, e.g., id. at 437, 438. A letter sent\n\nby M s. King to plaintiff in January 2003 concluded by saying: “I don’t know\n\nwhat additional words to use to make the point more clear, you will not be rehired\n\nby the school district.” Id. at 438.\n\n      Finally, on M ay 23, 2003, M s. King sent plaintiff the letter that became the\n\nbasis of a second EEOC charge and, ultimately, this case. See id. at 311 (EEOC\n\ncharge citing M ay 23 letter); id. at 511 n.4 (district court order noting plaintiff’s\n\nreliance on M ay 23 letter as only discrete act of discrimination); see also Br. of\n\n                                           -3-\n\fAplt. at 8-9. In the letter, she reiterated the school district’s refusal to consider\n\nplaintiff for any position and directed him to “re-read the volume of previous\n\nresponses to you on the subject of your rehire by the school district.” Id. at 439.\n\nPlaintiff filed his associated charge with the EEOC on August 1, 2003. He was\n\nsent a right-to-sue letter on M arch 31, 2004, id. at 312, and filed this action on\n\nJune 18, 2004, asserting claims of race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\nand race discrimination and retaliation under Title VII.\n\n                          U ntimeliness of Title VII Claims\n\n      There are two limitations provisions that together fix the time frame for\n\nbringing suit under Title VII. First, the claimant must timely seek administrative\n\nrelief. “In a deferral state such as K ansas, a Title VII claimant must file his\n\ndiscrimination charge within 300 days of the alleged unlawful act.” Peterson v.\n\nCity of Wichita, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531397\"><a href=\"/opinion/531397/51-fair-emplpraccas-525-51-empl-prac-dec-p-39449-harold-peterson-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1308 (10th Cir. 1989) (applying 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-5(e)(1)); see also Davidson v.

Second, the claimant must timely pursue legal action upon\n\nconclusion of the administrative proceedings. “Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)\n\na com plainant has ninety days in which to file suit after receipt of an EEOC\n\nright-to-sue letter.” Witt v.

However, the district court noted that the letter simply restated the school\n\ndistrict’s unconditional decision, first related to plaintiff in August 2001, refusing\n\nto consider him for rehire in light of his past employment record. Thus, relying\n\non the non-revival rule cited above, the district court held that the operative\n\nlimitations period commenced and expired long before this action was filed.\n\nPlaintiff challenges that decision, arguing that the M ay 23, 2003 letter was a\n\ndiscrete act of discrimination/retaliation actionable independently of the school\n\ndistrict’s prior refusal to rehire him.\n\n      The circumstances and briefing in this case suggest two polarized positions,\n\nneither of which, in its extreme form, seems fully satisfactory: (1) an employer\n\nmay unilaterally impose a once-and-for-all condition on a claimant’s right to seek\n\nredress for discrimination in hiring (or promotion, etc.) that could ultimately\n\ninvolve the denial, over an extended time period, of multiple job opportunities,\n\nversus (2) the claimant can perpetually revive an otherwise expired claim of\n\ndiscrimination by repeatedly applying for additional positions. W e need not\n\nchoose between these stark alternatives here, however, as the particular claim\n\n                                          -5-\n\fpursued by plaintiff falls in the middle ground between them. Before explaining\n\nour resolution of this case, we review some pertinent background principles that\n\nare clearly established in the case law.\n\n      First, “[e]ach discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges\n\nalleging that act.” Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. M organ, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121149\"><a href=\"/opinion/121149/national-railroad-passenger-corporation-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113\n\n(2002). Thus, “discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even\n\nwhen they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.” Id.\n\n      Second, in determining when the limitation period comm ences, “the proper\n\nfocus is upon the time of the discrim inatory acts, not upon the time at which the\n\nconsequences of the acts became most painful.” Del. State Coll. v. Ricks,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110367\"><a href=\"/opinion/110367/delaware-state-college-v-ricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (1980) (quotation omitted). Thus, when an initial\n\ndiscriminatory act is time-barred, a later related event is not actionable if it is\n\nmerely a consequence of the first; to be actionable, the later event must involve\n\nan independent act of discrimination (which in certain circumstances may be\n\ninherent in the event, but otherwise requires explicit supporting allegations).\n\nCom pare id. at 257-58 (holding claim time-barred because alleged discrimination\n\noccurred w hen plaintiff w as denied tenure, not when he w as later terminated as a\n\nresult) with Bazemore v. Friday, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111746\"><a href=\"/opinion/111746/bazemore-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394-97 & n.6 (1986) (holding\n\ndisparate-pay claim timely, despite genesis of disparity in segregation long since\n\nabandoned, because “[e]ach week’s paycheck that delivers less to a black than to\n\na similarly situated white is [inherently] a wrong actionable under Title VII”).\n\n                                           -6-\n\fIn the same vein, a time-barred act cannot supply the requisite discriminatory\n\nanimus for an otherw ise neutral act within the limitations period. See United\n\nAir Lines, Inc. v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109671\"><a href=\"/opinion/109671/united-air-lines-inc-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557-58 (1977) (rejecting claim by rehired\n\nemployee for allegedly wrongful denial of seniority for years spent outside\n\nworkforce following resignation under admittedly discriminatory marriage\n\nprohibition, because seniority scheme was facially neutral and discrimination\n\nassociated with resignation was outside limitations period).\n\n      Complementing the above two principles is a third that is especially\n\npertinent here. W hile a time-barred discriminatory act will not make actionable\n\n(or be made actionable by) its later facially neutral consequences, such an act will\n\nnot preclude an action for subsequent related acts that would support suit on their\n\nown. “The existence of past acts and the employer’s prior knowledge of their\n\noccurrence . . . does not bar employees from filing charges about related discrete\n\nacts so long as the acts are independently discriminatory and charges addressing\n\nthose acts are themselves timely filed.” M organ, 536 U.S. at 113. The Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Bazemore, noted above, illustrates this point in holding pay\n\ndisparities based on race actionable (with each pay check) even though they were\n\nrelated to historical segregation practices not subject to suit.\n\n      Plaintiff contends that his case falls within the scope of this last principle.\n\nBased on his administrative charge and the pleadings and pretrial order herein,\n\nwe disagree. Plaintiff did not assert and offer a supporting factual basis for a\n\n                                          -7-\n\fclaim that the school district’s letter of M ay 23, 2003 reflected an independent act\n\nof discrimination/retaliation in hiring. Neither the charge, complaint, nor pretrial\n\norder referred to any position that plaintiff had applied for and been denied, for\n\nprohibited reasons, by that letter. See App. I at 11, 29, 126. Rather, consistent\n\nwith its content, which just referred back to past correspondence, the letter was\n\nalleged to be w rongful because it reflected a continuation of the district’s\n\npreviously stated refusal to consider plaintiff for work based on his employment\n\nhistory. Id. To the extent this broadly stated decision was itself actionable,\n\ndistinct from any independently discriminatory/retaliatory refusal to rehire\n\nplaintiff for a particular job, the time for suit had clearly expired and, under the\n\nauthority discussed above, was not revived by plaintiff’s repeated attempts to\n\nrevisit the matter.\n\n      None of the arguments advanced by plaintiff overcome this basic deficiency\n\nin his case. In particular, he contends that his copious correspondence with the\n\nschool district over the broad decision it made in 2001 should be deemed a series\n\nof discrete job applications and that the school district’s reaffirmations of that\n\ndecision should be deemed a series of discrete (and independently discriminatory\n\nor retaliatory) decisions denying each application, the last of which, the letter of\n\nM ay 23, 2003, would not be time-barred. But that is simply not the charge he\n\npursued administratively and the claim he pled in the district court, which fix the\n\nscope of the case properly before us. Those remedial efforts were directed at the\n\n                                          -8-\n\fschool district’s broad decision in August 2001 as reaffirmed, in equally broad\n\nterms, in M ay 2003, not at any particular, independently discriminatory hiring\n\ndecision.\n\n      Thus, as noted earlier, we have no occasion to decide whether the school\n\ndistrict’s once-and-for-all refusal to consider plaintiff for employment established\n\na single immutable accrual date for all failure-to-hire claims or, conversely, that\n\nthe intended effect of the unconditional refusal was rendered meaningless by\n\nsubsequent application(s) for employment that it w as intended to foreclose.\n\nW e hold only that an employer’s mere reiteration of a broad decision not to\n\nconsider an applicant for any employment does not revive expired objections\n\nregarding its initial statement of that decision.\n\n                            Untimeliness of § 1981 Claim\n\n      The forum state’s statute of limitations for personal injury actions governs\n\ncivil rights claims under both 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and § 1983.
