Flaiz, Geauga County Prosecutor, Craig A. Swenson and Nicholas A.\nBurling, Assistant Prosecutors, Courthouse Annex, 231 Main Street, Suite 3A,\nChardon, OH 44024 (For Plaintiff-Appellee).\n\nMichael A. Partlow, 112 South Water Street, Suite C, Kent, OH 44240 (For Defendant-\nAppellant).\n\n\n\nCYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE, J.\n\n        {¶1}     Appellant, Thomas M. Lane, III, appeals his conviction in the Geauga\n\nCounty Court of Common Pleas following his guilty plea to three counts of aggravated\n\nmurder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder, and felonious assault. Appellant’s\n\nconviction resulted from a shooting at Chardon High School in which he killed three\n\nstudents, paralyzed another, and injured two others.        At the time of the offenses,\n\nappellant was 17 years old. At issue is whether Ohio’s mandatory juvenile bindover\n\fstatutes, at R.C. 2152.10 and R.C. 2152.12, are unconstitutional and whether\n\nappellant’s sentence to life in prison without parole violates the prohibition against cruel\n\nand unusual punishment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nSubstantive Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {¶2}   On March 1, 2012, a complaint was filed in the Geauga County Juvenile\n\nCourt, charging appellant with three counts of aggravated murder by shooting and killing\n\nthree students at Chardon High School, two counts of attempted aggravated murder\n\nagainst two other students, and one count of felonious assault against another student.\n\nOn the same date, the state moved to transfer this case to the General Division of the\n\nCourt of Common Pleas for appellant to be tried as an adult.\n\n       {¶3}   On March 21, 2012, the juvenile court ordered Phillip Resnick, M.D.,\n\nforensic psychiatrist, to complete a competency evaluation to determine whether\n\nappellant was competent to assist his attorneys in the juvenile court proceedings. On\n\nMay 2, 2012, the juvenile court held a competency hearing. Following the hearing, the\n\ncourt found that appellant was competent for purposes of the juvenile proceedings.\n\n       {¶4}   On May 24, 2012, the juvenile court held a bindover hearing. Following\n\nthe hearing, the court found that appellant was 17 years old on the date of the alleged\n\noffenses. The court also found that probable cause existed to believe that appellant\n\ncommitted three counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted aggravated\n\nmurder, which are “category one offenses” under R.C. 2152.02(B)(B), mandating\n\nbindover under R.C. 2152.10 and R.C. 2152.12.            As a result, the juvenile court\n\ntransferred appellant’s case to the general division.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f      {¶5}   On June 4, 2012, appellant was indicted in a six-count indictment charging\n\nhim with aggravated murder of Demetrius Hewlin, an unclassified felony, in violation of\n\nR.C. 2903.01(A) (Count One), with a multiple-killings death penalty specification, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and a firearm specification, in violation of R.C.\n\n2941.145(A); aggravated murder of Russell King, Jr. (Count Two), with the same death\n\npenalty specification and a firearm specification; aggravated murder of Daniel Parmertor\n\n(Count Three), with the same death penalty specification and a firearm specification;\n\nattempted aggravated murder of Nate Mueller, a felony of the first degree, in violation of\n\nR.C. 2903.01(A) and R.C. 2923.02(A) (Count Four), with a firearm specification;\n\nattempted aggravated murder of Nicholas Walczak (Count Five), with a firearm\n\nspecification; and felonious assault of Joy Rickers, a felony of the second degree, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) (Count Six), with a firearm specification. Appellant pled\n\nnot guilty. Subsequently, he pled not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\n      {¶6}   On February 8, 2013, appellant filed a motion for an order referring him for\n\na competency evaluation by the Psycho-Diagnostic Clinic.          The court granted the\n\nmotion. In her evaluation, Lynn A. Luna Jones, Ph.D., forensic psychologist, concluded\n\nthat appellant was competent to stand trial.\n\n      {¶7}   On February 26, 2013, the trial court held a competency hearing, after\n\nwhich the court found appellant was competent to stand trial. Later that day, he filed a\n\nwritten guilty plea and the court held a change-of-plea hearing. After waiving his rights,\n\nappellant withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and pled guilty to each\n\ncount of the indictment. Pursuant to the parties’ plea bargain, appellant pled guilty to\n\nthe aggravated murder of Demetrius Hewlin, Russell King, Jr., and Daniel Parmertor in\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fCounts One, Two, and Three, respectively, and the firearm specifications to those\n\ncounts. Further, appellant pled guilty to attempted aggravated murder of Nate Mueller\n\nand Nicholas Walczak in Courts Four and Five, respectively, and the firearm\n\nspecifications to those counts. Finally, appellant pled guilty to Count Six, felonious\n\nassault of Joy Rickers, and the firearm specification to that count. In exchange for his\n\nplea, the death penalty specifications were dismissed.\n\n       {¶8}   In support of the factual basis for the guilty plea, the state offered: (1) the\n\nvideo recording of appellant’s crimes, (2) the dash cam video of his apprehension by\n\nGeauga County Sheriff’s Deputy Jon Bilicic, and (3) the video of appellant’s confession\n\ngiven to detectives at the Geauga County Safety Center.\n\n       {¶9}   The video taken from a security camera in the school cafeteria shows that\n\non February 27, 2012, at about 7:30 a.m., appellant is sitting alone at a table in the\n\ncafeteria with his book bag on the table. He watches a group of eight to nine students\n\nwho are talking to each other at a nearby table. Appellant then moves to a table directly\n\nbehind this group of students and continues to watch them. One of these students, Nick\n\nWalczak, is standing at the end of the table and the others are seated, some with their\n\nbacks to appellant and others facing in his direction.\n\n       {¶10} After watching these students for about eight minutes, appellant goes\n\nthrough his book bag. He pulls out a handgun and a knife, stands, aims his gun at the\n\ngroup of students in front of him, and starts shooting. Appellant shoots Russell King in\n\nthe back of the head. He also shoots Nick Walczak who falls to the floor. Appellant then\n\nwalks around his table and along the victims’ table while repeatedly shooting at them.\n\nHe shoots Demetrius Hewlin in the head and also shoots Daniel Parmertor in the head.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fTwo other students, Nate Mueller and Joy Rickers, are also shot. Everyone in the\n\ncafeteria runs out. Appellant also runs out of the cafeteria with his gun and knife.\n\n       {¶11} The video taken by a security camera in the adjoining hallway shows a\n\nlarge group of students running frantically from the cafeteria and down the hallway.\n\nWhile Nick Walczak is limping down the hallway, appellant runs up to him from behind\n\nand shoots him again, this time in the back of his neck at close range. While appellant\n\nis running up to Nick, one can see across the chest of appellant’s long-sleeve, pullover\n\nshirt in large bold letters the word, “Killer.” Nick falls to the floor and appellant runs\n\naway from him.\n\n       {¶12} Meanwhile, Deputy Bilicic, while on routine patrol, was advised of the\n\nshooting and given a description of the suspect. The deputy was told that the suspect\n\nhad fled the high school. At about 8:30 a.m., Deputy Bilicic was dispatched to Woodin\n\nRoad, about one mile from the school, and advised the suspect was at that location.\n\nWhen Deputy Bilicic approached the area, he saw appellant sitting on the side of the\n\nroad with his handgun and knife near him. After Deputy Bilicic advised appellant of his\n\nMiranda rights, he said he just shot people at the high school.\n\n       {¶13} Deputy Bilicic drove appellant to the Geauga County Safety Center where\n\nhe was interviewed by two Geauga County Sheriff’s detectives.           After again being\n\nadvised of his Miranda rights, appellant said that at about 7:00 that morning, he rode the\n\nschool bus to Chardon High School.          He went in the school with a .22-caliber,\n\nsemiautomatic Ruger handgun and a knife he had put in his book bag. He said he\n\nbrought the gun because he planned to shoot people. He brought the knife in case he\n\nneeded another weapon while reloading his gun. He said he went in and out of the\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fbathroom three times because he wanted to shoot students and was thinking about\n\ndoing it. He said that when he left the bathroom for the last time, he sat alone at a table\n\ndirectly behind a group of students he was going to shoot so he would be close to them.\n\n       {¶14} Appellant said that at about 7:30 a.m., he switched the safety off on the\n\ngun. He then pulled his pistol and knife out of his book bag. He stood up and, while\n\naiming at the group, fired all ten rounds in the clip. He realized he needed to reload his\n\ngun so he ran out of the cafeteria. Appellant said that as he left the cafeteria, an adult\n\ncafeteria monitor started following him so appellant spun around and aimed his gun at\n\nhim so he would not chase him. Appellant then ran down the hallway and exited the\n\nbuilding.\n\n       {¶15} Appellant said that after he ran out of the school, he dropped the empty\n\nclip out of the gun and loaded it with a second clip. He ran into the woods until he\n\nreached a road. He sat down on the side of the road until Deputy Bilicic approached\n\nhim.\n\n       {¶16} Appellant said he did not know why he did this. He said he does not have\n\nproblems with anyone and was not upset with anyone. He said that no one had bullied\n\nhim. This was just something he chose to do. He said that by doing this he was trying\n\nto accomplish something. He said he created this goal and he needed to see it through.\n\nHe said he had been thinking about doing this for about two weeks.\n\n       {¶17} Appellant said he stole the gun the day before the shooting from his uncle\n\nwhile he was visiting him. He also stole a second magazine and a handful of bullets\n\nthat were stored with the gun. When he stole the gun it was empty. The night before\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe shooting, he loaded both magazines and put one of them in the gun. He put the gun\n\nin his book bag that morning because he felt he would probably shoot people.\n\n         {¶18} Appellant said he did not choose any particular people to shoot. Rather,\n\nhe said he shot at a random group of people. He said that, while he had seen these\n\nstudents before, he did not know them. He said he aimed at their heads so they would\n\ndie quicker and not suffer.\n\n         {¶19} Appellant said he attended Chardon High School for the first half of ninth\n\ngrade.     Since then, he has attended Lake Academy, an alternative high school in\n\nWilloughby. He decided to go there because Lake Academy gives its students the\n\noption of working while going to school. He said he planned to work and earn money to\n\ngo to college. Every school day, he takes the school bus to Chardon High School,\n\nwhich arrives there at about 7:00 a.m. He does not take classes there. He just waits in\n\nthe cafeteria for about one-half hour until 7:30 a.m., when he catches a bus that takes\n\nhim to Auburn Career Center in Concord Township. From there, he takes another bus\n\nto Lake Academy. Appellant said he shot the students while he was waiting for the bus\n\nto take him to Auburn Career Center.\n\n         {¶20} Appellant said he is in the eleventh grade, but also takes twelfth grade\n\nclasses. He was going to graduate that year so he would be graduating early. He was\n\nplanning to go to college to study psychology. He believes he is more mature than\n\nothers his age.\n\n         {¶21} Appellant said he bought the shirt with the word “Killer” printed across the\n\nchest about one week earlier. He said he wore it today because he was going to be\n\nshooting people.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       {¶22} In response to the detectives’ questions, appellant insisted he never shot\n\nanyone while he was running down the hallway.\n\n       {¶23} Appellant said he shot a lot of bullets into a small group of people and\n\nthought someone would be killed. He said he knows what he did was wrong; he feels\n\nterrible for doing it; and he has regret.\n\n       {¶24} Appellant said he has lived with his maternal grandparents since he was\n\nabout three years old. He said that at that time, the court decided his parents were not\n\nfit to raise him and his grandparents were awarded custody.\n\n       {¶25} Dr. Lynn A. Luna Jones of the Psycho-Diagnostic Clinic stated in her\n\ncompetency report that during appellant’s prior competency evaluation with Dr. Resnick,\n\nappellant told him that he had heard voices and experienced delusions.        However,\n\nappellant admitted to Dr. Jones that he has never actually experienced any of these\n\nsymptoms. Appellant admitted he “lied” to Dr. Resnick when he told him he had heard\n\nvoices. With regard to appellant’s report to Dr. Resnick that he experienced anxiety and\n\nconfusion, he denied that he ever felt that way. He also denied he had any prior fears\n\nof losing his mind, as he had previously reported. Appellant said he reported these\n\nsymptoms because he was trying to appear schizophrenic. Finally, he said he lied\n\nabout his report of being a victim of sexual abuse because he thought it “couldn’t hurt”\n\nto say he was.\n\n       {¶26} Appellant said he was able to successfully manipulate Ravenwood mental\n\nhealth staff at the jail to believe he was mentally ill. He said he feigned symptoms of\n\nbeing depressed, suicidal, sexually abused, psychotic, and schizophrenic. He said he\n\nwas able to “force [himself] to cry when necessary to convince staff he was depressed.”\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fHe said he told staff he was claustrophobic so he could be put in with the general jail\n\npopulation instead of being segregated from the other inmates. Regarding the voices\n\nhe reported to staff at the Geauga County Safety Center, appellant said he “made it all\n\nup.”\n\n       {¶27} When Dr. Jones asked appellant why he decided to change his report of\n\nmental health symptoms, he said he “was afraid that if [he] didn’t come clean, they\n\nwouldn’t let me change my plea to guilty.”\n\n       {¶28} Dr. Jones concluded that appellant has no mental condition or defect and\n\nhas no signs of delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, or psychosis. She further\n\nconcluded that appellant fabricated these symptoms in order to evade prosecution.\n\n       {¶29} The court found that appellant voluntarily entered his guilty plea; accepted\n\nhis guilty plea; and found him guilty of each count of the indictment. The court ordered\n\na pre-sentence report and scheduled the matter for sentencing.\n\n       {¶30} The case proceeded to sentencing on March 19, 2013. After taking his\n\nseat at the defense table, appellant took off his dress shirt, revealing an undershirt with\n\nthe word “Killer” written on it similar to the shirt he wore on February 27, 2012.\n\nAppellant’s counsel told the court that appellant is now 18 years old, and had instructed\n\nhim not to present any mitigation on his behalf. Instead, he said appellant wanted to\n\nmake a statement on his own behalf. Counsel said that he had urged him not to make\n\nthe statement he expected appellant to make, but that he has the right to make it.\n\n       {¶31} Appellant told the court he voluntarily and against the advice of his\n\ncounsel waived his right to present information in mitigation of punishment. Appellant\n\nthen turned around and, with his middle finger raised toward the victims’ families, said to\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fthem: “This hand that pulled the trigger, that killed your sons, now masturbates to the\n\nmemory. F_ _ _ all of you.”\n\n      {¶32} Phyllis Ferguson, Demetrius Hewlin’s mother, stated that appellant’s\n\nmurder of her son has devastated the lives of every member of their family. She spoke\n\nof how kind and unselfish Demetrius was. Ms. Ferguson said that whenever her back\n\nhurt, Demetrius would put her shoes on and tie them for her. She said that appellant\n\nstole her son’s life and he should never be allowed to do this to anyone again.\n\n      {¶33} Holly Walczak, Nick Walczak’s mother, while looking at appellant, said,\n\n“You can smile all you want.” She told appellant that because he took a gun to school\n\nand shot innocent students, he changed the lives of every member of her family and\n\ntheir quiet, peaceful town will never be the same.      Her son is now paralyzed and\n\nconfined to a wheelchair. She said that Nick had driven appellant home from school\n\nand was always kind to him, and she asked appellant why he would want to hurt Nick.\n\nShe thus debunked appellant’s statement to the detectives that he did not know his\n\nvictims. She told the court she watches her son suffer daily as a result of his injuries.\n\nShe asked the court to never release appellant from prison because he is dangerous\n\nand has caused too much pain.\n\n      {¶34} Crystal King, Russell King’s older sister, told the court that the murder of\n\nher brother has been the most difficult thing she has ever had to endure. She said she\n\nwas driving to work on February 27, 2012, when her fiancé called her and said there\n\nhad been a shooting at the high school. She called Russell’s cell phone over and over,\n\nbut there was no answer. She called her father. When he answered, he could hardly\n\nbreathe. She asked if he had heard anything, and he said, “he’s been shot.” Her\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fparents picked her up from work and drove her to the hospital. The doctor said it was\n\nvery bad. He said Russell had been shot in the head and was in surgery and if he\n\nmade it, he would be disabled. They went in the waiting room, which was filled with so\n\nmany people, the hospital staff moved them to a conference room. She said she does\n\nnot remember seeing any faces, just a sea of friends and family members that filled the\n\nentire hallway. Realizing that all these people were there for her brother brought tears\n\nto her eyes. She then returned to Russell’s room. As she walked in, her mother was\n\nyelling, “no, no, no,” over and over again. Crystal learned that Russell had just passed\n\naway. She said that appellant took not only the life of her only sibling and her parents’\n\nonly son, he also took the sense of safety from every parent in the community who\n\nsends their children to school. She said that appellant took so much away from so\n\nmany people, he deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison without parole. Like\n\nHolly Walczak, Crystal said that Russell and appellant used to be friends, again\n\ncontradicting appellant’s statement to police that he did not know his victims.\n\n       {¶35} Finally, Dina Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor’s mother, told the court that\n\nappellant murdered her son Danny who was just 16 years old. She said she will suffer\n\nthe rest of her life without her son. She is in pain every minute of every day. She no\n\nlonger wants to enjoy life or visit with family and friends. She will never be the same\n\nbecause of appellant. She said that appellant has stolen her life. She said he also stole\n\nDanny from his little brother and sister. Her younger children do not see the mother\n\nthey used to know because she is in constant anguish. They want to help her, but they\n\nare in too much pain themselves. She said she sees no remorse from appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f         {¶36} The court sentenced appellant on Count One, the aggravated murder of\n\nDemetrius Hewlin, to life in prison without parole; on Count Two, the aggravated murder\n\nof Russell King, Jr., to life in prison without parole; and on Count Three, the aggravated\n\nmurder of Daniel Parmertor, to life in prison without parole. With respect to Count Four,\n\nthe attempted aggravated murder of Nate Mueller, the court sentenced appellant to\n\neight years in prison.     On Count Five, the attempted aggravated murder of Nick\n\nWalczak, the court found that, after shooting Nick, appellant chased him down the\n\nhallway as Nick was running for his life. Appellant sprinted up behind him and shot him\n\nfrom behind. Nick is now paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. The court noted that\n\nappellant’s conduct merits the maximum sentence of 11 years in prison. On Count Six,\n\nthe felonious assault of Joy Rickers, the court sentenced appellant to six years in\n\nprison. Each of these prison terms was ordered to be served consecutively to each\n\nother.\n\n         {¶37} The court also imposed three-year prison terms for four of the firearm\n\nspecifications to Counts One, Two, Three, and Five, the aggravated murders and the\n\nattempted aggravated murder of Nick Walczak, based on appellant’s overall objectives\n\nin his criminal enterprise and the serious injuries he inflicted. The court noted that these\n\nfour victims suffered the most extreme injury, the three murdered victims having lost\n\ntheir lives and Nick being confined to a wheelchair. These terms were ordered to be\n\nserved consecutively to the prison terms imposed for each of the four underlying\n\nfelonies.\n\n         {¶38} Thus, in addition to the three life terms for the aggravated murders, the\n\ncourt imposed a total of 25 years in prison on the other offenses and 12 years for the\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\ffirearm specifications, all of which were ordered to be served consecutively, for a total of\n\n37 years in prison.\n\n       {¶39} Appellant     appeals    his   conviction    and    sentence,    asserting   four\n\nassignments of error.     Because his first two assigned errors are related, they are\n\nconsidered together. They allege:\n\n       {¶40} “[1.] THE JUVENILE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN, REVERSIBLE\n\nERROR BY BINDING APPELLANT OVER TO THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS TO\n\nBE TRIED AS AN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS (SIC).\n\n       {¶41} “[2.] THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR, AS A MATTER\n\nOF LAW, BY SENTENCING APPELLANT TO THREE TERMS OF INCARCERATION\n\nOF   LIFE    WITHOUT       THE    POSSIBILITY       OF    PAROLE,      IN    VIOLATION    OF\n\nAPPELLANT’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.”\n\nEffect of Appellant’s Guilty Plea on His Constitutional Challenge to Mandatory\n\nBindover\n\n       {¶42} As a preliminary matter, the state argues that because appellant pled\n\nguilty, he waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio’s mandatory\n\nbindover statutes, at R.C. 2152.10 and R.C. 2152.12. In support, the state cites State v.\n\nQuarterman, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26400, 2013-Ohio-3606, discretionary appeal\n\nallowed at 137 Ohio St.3d 1440, 2013-Ohio-5678, in which the Ninth District held that by\n\npleading guilty, the juvenile defendant, whose case had been bound over to the general\n\ndivision, waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio’s mandatory bindover\n\nprovisions and his attorney’s failure to object to their application. Id. at ¶8.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       {¶43} However, this court in State v. Platt, 11th Dist. Portage No. 89-P-2065,\n\n1990 Ohio App. LEXIS 3508 (Aug. 17, 1990), rejected this argument. In Platt, this court\n\nheld that a voluntary guilty plea waives all defects in the case, except the lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction of the court that accepted the plea. Id. at *4-*5. Further, this court\n\nheld that by entering a guilty plea, a juvenile does not waive objections to constitutional\n\ndeficiencies in the bindover hearing wherein the juvenile court transferred jurisdiction to\n\nthe general division. Id. at *5-*6. Accord State v. Riggins, 68 Ohio App.2d 1 (8th\n\nDist.1980), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶44} Thus, appellant’s challenge to the constitutionality of Ohio’s mandatory\n\nbindover statutes is properly before this court.\n\nOhio’s Mandatory Bindover of Juvenile Offenders\n\n       {¶45} Appellant     argues   that   Ohio’s   mandatory     bindover   statutes   are\n\nunconstitutional in that they allegedly violate due process and equal protection and the\n\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. We do not agree.\n\n       {¶46} A duly enacted Ohio statute enjoys “a strong presumption of\n\nconstitutionality.”   State v. Collier, 62 Ohio St.3d 267, 269 (1991). Further, where\n\nreasonably possible, courts must interpret challenged statutes so as to avoid\n\nconstitutional infirmities. Akron v. Rowland, 67 Ohio St.3d 374, 380 (1993). Before a\n\ncourt may declare a statute unconstitutional, the party challenging its constitutionality\n\nbears the heightened burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a clear conflict\n\nexists between the legislation and some particular constitutional provision. State v.\n\nMay, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2005-A-0011, 2006-Ohio-3406, ¶19; State ex rel.\n\nDickman v. Defenbacher, 164 Ohio St. 142 (1955), paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fAccordingly, there is a strong presumption that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes are\n\nconstitutional. Further, the constitutionality of a statute is a matter of law that we review\n\nde novo. State v. Jenson, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2005-L-193, 2006-Ohio-5169, ¶5.\n\n       {¶47} R.C. 2152.02(BB) provides that a “category one offense\" means\n\naggravated murder, murder, attempted aggravated murder, or attempted murder.\n\n       {¶48} Further, R.C. 2152.10(A)(1)(a) provides that a child who is alleged to be a\n\ndelinquent child is eligible for mandatory transfer and shall be transferred pursuant to\n\nR.C. 2152.12 if the child is charged with a category one offense, and the child was at\n\nleast 16 years old at the time of the offense.\n\n       {¶49} Moreover, R.C. 2152.12(A)(1)(a)(i) provides that after a complaint has\n\nbeen filed alleging that a child is a delinquent child for committing an act that would be\n\naggravated murder, murder, attempted aggravated murder, or attempted murder if\n\ncommitted by an adult, the juvenile court at a hearing shall transfer the case to the\n\ngeneral division if the child was 16 or 17 years old at the time of the offense and there is\n\nprobable cause to believe that the child committed the offense.           In explaining this\n\nstatute, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated:\n\n       {¶50} [The juvenile] court has a duty to transfer a case when it\n\n              determines that the elements of the transfer statute are met, to wit:\n\n              (1) the charged act would be aggravated murder, murder,\n\n              attempted aggravated murder, or attempted murder if committed by\n\n              an adult, (2) the child was 16 or 17 at the time of the act, [and] (3)\n\n              there is probable cause to believe that the child committed the act\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f               charged. R.C. 2152.12(A)(1)(a). In re A.J.S.,120 Ohio St.3d 185,\n\n               2008-Ohio-5307, ¶22.\n\nAppellant’s Due Process Challenge to Mandatory Bindover\n\n         {¶51} First, appellant argues that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes violated\n\nhis right to due process. Although he does not expressly state whether his argument is\n\nbased on procedural or substantive due process, we interpret it as based on the former.\n\nState v. Lee, 11th Dist. Lake No. 97-L-091, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4250, *12 (Sep. 11,\n\n1998).\n\n         {¶52} Procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution and Section 15, Article I of the Ohio Constitution are identical and\n\nrequire that, before the state can divest a person of a right, he or she must be given\n\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard. Lee, supra.\n\n         {¶53} Appellant argues his due process rights were violated because Ohio’s\n\nbindover statutes do not provide for an amenability hearing at which the court considers\n\nthe factors set forth in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541 (1966), before the juvenile\n\ncourt orders a bindover.\n\n         {¶54} In Kent, the District of Columbia’s bindover statute provided that the\n\njuvenile court may waive its jurisdiction over the juvenile, but did not provide any\n\ndefinitive bindover procedures.    After a motion for a bindover was filed, the judge\n\nsummarily and without any hearing or explanation ordered the juvenile to be held for\n\ntrial as an adult. The juvenile was then tried and convicted. The court of appeals\n\naffirmed. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the conviction on the\n\nground that due process required more procedure than was provided to the juvenile. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\fat 556. The Supreme Court in Kent held that in order to satisfy due process: (1) the\n\njuvenile court must hold a hearing, (2) at which the juvenile is represented by counsel,\n\nand (3) the juvenile court must provide a statement of reasons for its bindover decision.\n\nId. at 557. Further, the Court in Kent held that in deciding whether to order a bindover,\n\nthe juvenile court should consider certain listed factors. Id. at 566-567.\n\n       {¶55} As noted above, appellant argues that, pursuant to Kent, due process\n\nrequired an amenability hearing before he could be bound over to the general division.\n\nHowever, this court in Lee, supra, held that Kent does not stand for this proposition.\n\nLee, supra, at *15. As in this case, the defendant in Lee argued that Ohio’s mandatory\n\nbindover statutes violated due process because, in his view, he was entitled to an\n\namenability hearing pursuant to Kent.        However, this court in Lee held that the\n\ndefendant was granted the procedural protections required by Kent because a probable\n\ncause hearing was held at which the defendant was represented by counsel and the\n\ntrial court made findings of fact in support of its order transferring jurisdiction to the\n\ngeneral division. Lee, supra, at *15-*16. Further, this court in Lee held that due process\n\ndoes not require an amenability hearing. Id. at *16.\n\n       {¶56} Moreover, the Third District in State v. Kelly, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-98-26,\n\n1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 5630 (Nov. 18, 1998), also held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover\n\nstatutes do not violate due process. Id. at *22. As in the instant case, the defendant in\n\nKelly argued that, because the mandatory bindover statutes do not provide for an\n\namenability hearing at which juvenile courts are required to consider the factors listed in\n\nKent, supra, Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes violate due process.\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       {¶57} The Third District in Kelly noted that the bindover statute at issue in Kent\n\ninvolved discretionary, rather than mandatory, bindovers. The court in Kelly stated that,\n\nbecause the Kent factors were intended to address the problem of arbitrary decision-\n\nmaking and disparate treatment in discretionary bindover determinations, due process\n\ndoes not require use of these factors when the legislature has statutorily eliminated\n\ndiscretionary bindover determinations. Id. at *19-*20.\n\n       {¶58} The Third District in Kelly stated that due process does not require a\n\nweighing of specific factors prior to a transfer; it merely requires that such transfers not\n\nbe made on an arbitrary basis. Id. at *20. Thus, the court held that due process does\n\nnot prevent the General Assembly from eliminating the weighing of the Kent factors for\n\ncertain serious offenses, provided that removal is rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental purpose. Id. The court stated that, because an amenability hearing using\n\nthe Kent factors is not a fundamental right, the rational basis test applies, and, in\n\napplying that test, the court held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes are rationally\n\nrelated to the legitimate governmental objective of deterring violent juvenile crime. Id.\n\n       {¶59} The court in Kelly held that the procedural prerequisites to transfer\n\ndescribed in Kent, i.e., representation by counsel, a hearing, and a statement of\n\nreasons, are provided for in Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes. Kelly, supra, at *21.\n\nThus, the Third District held that the elimination of a separate amenability hearing does\n\nnot violate procedural due process. Id.\n\n       {¶60} Further, the Second and Ninth Districts have also held that Ohio’s\n\nmandatory bindover statutes do not violate due process. State v. Ramey, 2d Dist.\n\nMontgomery No. 16442, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2617, *2-*3 (May 22, 1998); State v.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\fCollins, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 97CA006845, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2474, *5 (June 3,\n\n1998).\n\n         {¶61} Moreover, appellant does not cite any case law holding that a mandatory\n\nbindover statute violates due process.\n\n         {¶62} Here, appellant was represented by counsel at a probable cause hearing\n\nheld by the juvenile court. Further, the juvenile court’s judgment entry included findings\n\nof fact supporting its decision transferring the matter to the general division. Based on\n\nthe foregoing authority, Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes do not violate due process.\n\nAppellant’s Equal Protection Challenge to Mandatory Bindover\n\n         {¶63} Next, appellant argues that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes violated\n\nhis right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution and Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n         {¶64} The standard for determining if a statute violates equal protection is\n\n“essentially the same under state and federal law.” Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police\n\nDept., 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 353 (1994). “Under a traditional equal protection analysis,\n\nclass distinctions in legislation are permissible if they bear some rational relationship to\n\na legitimate governmental objective. Departures from traditional equal protection\n\nprinciples are permitted only when burdens upon suspect classifications or\n\nabridgements of fundamental rights are involved.” State ex rel. Vana v. Maple Hts. City\n\nCouncil, 54 Ohio St.3d 91, 92 (1990). The bindover statutes do not affect a suspect\n\nclass (e.g., race or gender) or a fundamental right (e.g., speech or religion). Lee, supra,\n\nat *17. In fact, appellant concedes the rational basis test applies to his equal-protection\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fchallenge.   Thus, the bindover statutes need only bear a rational relationship to a\n\nlegitimate governmental purpose Adkins v. McFaul, 76 Ohio St.3d 350, 351 (1996).\n\n       {¶65} Appellant argues that no rational basis exists for the disparate treatment\n\nin the bindover statutes of juveniles who are 14 or 15 years old as opposed to those\n\nwho are 16 or 17 years old. Under the bindover statutes, juveniles who are 16 or 17 are\n\nsubject to mandatory bindover if probable cause exists to believe they committed a\n\ncategory one offense. In contrast, similarly-situated juveniles who are 14 or 15 are only\n\nsubject to mandatory bindover if they were previously adjudicated delinquent and\n\ncommitted to the department of youth services for committing a category one offense.\n\nR.C. 2152.10(A)(1)(b).\n\n       {¶66} Appellant contends that this disparate treatment is not supported by\n\nscientific evidence. However, as the party challenging the constitutionality of the\n\nstatutes, appellant had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statutes\n\nare unconstitutional, i.e., that the subject classification is not rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate governmental objective. Because appellant failed to meet this burden, he\n\nfailed to rebut the strong presumption that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes are\n\nconstitutional.\n\n       {¶67} In any event, the purpose of this legislation is to protect society and\n\nreduce violent crime by juveniles. Lee, supra, at *17. Contrary to appellant’s argument,\n\njuveniles who are 14 or 15 are markedly different from those who are 16 or 17 in many\n\nways, e.g., in terms of physical development and maturity. Juveniles who are 14 years\n\nold are typically still immature, while those who are 17, or in appellant’s case, 17 and\n\none-half years old, are nearly adults. Thus, the legislature’s decision to single out older\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fjuvenile homicide offenders, who are potentially more street-wise, hardened,\n\ndangerous, and violent, is rationally related to this legitimate governmental purpose.\n\n       {¶68} Further, this court in Lee, supra, has held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover\n\nstatutes do not violate equal protection. Id. at *17. In addition, the Second, Third, and\n\nNinth Districts have likewise held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes do not violate\n\nequal protection. Ramey, supra; Kelly, supra, at *26-*27; Collins, supra, at *5.\n\n       {¶69} Moreover, appellant does not cite any case law holding that a mandatory\n\nbindover statute violates equal protection.\n\n       {¶70} In view of the foregoing analysis, Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes do\n\nnot violate equal protection.\n\nAppellant’s Eighth Amendment Challenge to Mandatory Bindover\n\n       {¶71} Next, appellant argues his bindover under Ohio’s mandatory bindover\n\nstatutes and his sentence to life in prison without parole violated the prohibition against\n\ncruel and unusual punishment pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio Constitution. “‘A punishment does not\n\nviolate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, if it be not\n\nso greatly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the sense of justice of the\n\ncommunity.’” State v. Dioneff, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2006-A-0063, 2007-Ohio-3387,\n\n¶79, quoting State v. Chaffin, 30 Ohio St.2d 13 (1972), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n“‘Eighth Amendment violations are rare and instances of cruel and unusual punishment\n\nare limited to those punishments, which, under the circumstances, would be considered\n\nshocking to any reasonable person.’” Dioneff, supra, quoting State v. Rhodes, 11th Dist.\n\nLake No. 2000-L-089, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 5650, *21 (December 14, 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fSentences that fall within the statutory range cannot amount to cruel and unusual\n\npunishment. State v. Bengal, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2006-L-123, 2007-Ohio-2691, ¶17;\n\nState v. Gladding, 66 Ohio App.3d 502, 513 (11th Dist.1990); State v. Long, 1st Dist.\n\nHamilton No. C-110160, 2012-Ohio-3052, (“Long I”), reversed on other grounds at\n\n____Ohio St.3d ____, 2014-Ohio-849.\n\n       {¶72} With respect to appellant’s argument that his mandatory bindover\n\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment, he does not cite any case law holding that\n\nthe mandatory transfer of juveniles to the general division without an amenability\n\nhearing constitutes punishment, let alone cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       {¶73} The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by its very terms\n\napplies only to punishments. The word “punishment” has been defined as follows: “In\n\ncriminal law[, a]ny * * * penalty * * * or confinement inflicted upon a person by authority\n\nof the * * * sentence of a court, for some crime or offense committed by him * * *.”\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1398 (4th Ed. Rev. 1968). Further, “[m]andatory bindover does\n\nnot equate to punishment any more than the mere prosecution of an adult in the\n\ncommon pleas court constitutes punishment.”        Quarterman, supra, at ¶16 (J. Carr,\n\nconcurring).\n\n       {¶74} Because appellant’s mandatory bindover was not a penalty or\n\nconfinement inflicted on him pursuant to a sentence of the juvenile court, it was not a\n\npunishment, and appellant’s mandatory bindover did not constitute cruel and unusual\n\npunishment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fAppellant’s Eighth Amendment Challenge to his Life-Without-Parole Sentence\n\n       {¶75} Appellant cites no case law holding that a sentence of life without parole\n\nimposed on a juvenile following his or her conviction of an intentional homicide amounts\n\nto cruel and unusual punishment. Instead, he relies on a trilogy of cases decided by the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court. However, each of these cases is inapposite as none\n\nholds that the sentence of a juvenile homicide offender to a discretionary sentence of\n\nlife without parole constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       {¶76} First, in Miller v. Alabama, 132 S.Ct. 2455 (2012), the United States\n\nSupreme Court held that a mandatory life-without-parole sentence for juvenile homicide\n\noffenders is cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 2469.\n\n       {¶77} However, Miller is distinguishable because appellant’s sentence of life\n\nwithout parole was discretionary, not mandatory. State v. Long, ____ Ohio St.3d ____,\n\n2014-Ohio-849 (“Long II”), ¶5. The trial court had the discretion to impose either life\n\nwithout parole or life with parole eligibility after serving a definite period of 20, 25, or 30\n\nyears. Id.; R.C. 2929.03(A)(1). Thus, “Ohio’s sentencing scheme does not [run] afoul\n\nof Miller, because the sentence of life without parole is discretionary.” Long II at ¶19.\n\n       {¶78} Next, in Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), the United States\n\nSupreme Court held that the imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders is\n\ncruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 575. However, Roper is distinguishable because\n\nappellant was not sentenced to death.\n\n       {¶79} Finally, in Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010), the United States\n\nSupreme Court held that the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile\n\noffender who did not commit homicide is cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 82.\n\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fGraham is distinguishable since appellant was convicted of three counts of aggravated\n\nmurder.\n\n      {¶80} While none of these cases applies to appellant’s sentence, he essentially\n\nargues this court should extend their holdings to invalidate his life-without-parole\n\nsentence. However, appellant does not reference any pertinent authority supporting\n\nsuch extension. To the contrary, the Supreme Court in Miller, supra, stated that a\n\nsentencing court is not precluded from imposing a life-without-parole sentence on a\n\njuvenile homicide offender. Id. at 2469; accord Long II at ¶14.\n\n      {¶81} It is worth noting that in Graham, supra, the United States Supreme Court\n\nstated that 44 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government permit\n\nsentences of life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders. Id. at 2034-2036.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court’s Decision in Miller v. Alabama\n\n      {¶82} Pursuant to Miller, supra, a sentencing court must consider mitigating\n\ncircumstances, including the juvenile’s youth and its attendant circumstances, before a\n\njuvenile homicide offender can be sentenced to life without parole. Id. at 2475. The\n\nSupreme Court in Miller held that a mandatory sentence of life without parole imposed\n\non a juvenile is cruel and unusual punishment because such sentence:\n\n      {¶83} precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark\n\n             features--among them, [1] immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to\n\n             appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking into account\n\n             [2] the family and home environment that surrounds him--and from\n\n             which he cannot usually extricate himself--no matter how brutal or\n\n             dysfunctional. It neglects [3] the circumstances of the homicide\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\f              offense, including [4] the extent of his participation in the conduct\n\n              and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him. Id.\n\n              at 2468.\n\n       {¶84} The United States Supreme Court decided Miller in 2012, one year before\n\nappellant’s sentencing, which occurred in March 2013.\n\n       {¶85} In Long II, decided in 2014, the Supreme Court of Ohio expressly followed\n\nMiller in holding that a trial court, in sentencing a juvenile offender for aggravated\n\nmurder, must consider his youth as a mitigating factor before imposing a sentence of life\n\nwithout parole. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. Further, the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nin Long II held that the record must reflect that the court specifically considered the\n\njuvenile offender’s youth as a mitigating factor at sentencing when imposing a prison\n\nterm of life without parole. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶86} The Court in Long II stated that, “[a]lthough Miller does not require that\n\nspecific findings be made on the record, it does mandate that a trial court consider as\n\nmitigating the offender’s youth and attendant characteristics before imposing a sentence\n\nof life without parole.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at ¶27. The Court held that the offender’s\n\nyouth at the time of the offense must be “weighed against any statutory consideration\n\nthat might make an offense more serious or an offender more likely to recidivate.” Id. at\n\n¶19.   The Court stated that, because a life-without-parole sentence implies that\n\nrehabilitation is impossible, when the court imposes such sentence, its reasons for this\n\nsentence should be on the record. Id.\n\n       {¶87} Although appellant explicitly waived the right to present information in\n\nmitigation of punishment, appellant’s trial counsel fully informed the court that it was\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\frequired to consider appellant’s age as a mitigating factor.          He quoted a pleading\n\nrecently filed in the United States Supreme Court, as follows:\n\n      {¶88} Jurisprudence has been toward more not less protection for\n\n             juvenile offenders.\n\n      {¶89} This trend began in Thompson v. Oklahoma in which William\n\n             Thompson challenged a death sentence pronounced for his first\n\n             degree murder conviction which stemmed from his active\n\n             participation in a brutal murder at the age of 15.\n\n      {¶90} The Supreme Court of the United States held that regardless of the\n\n             underlying    crime,   the     death    penalty    violated    the   Eighth\n\n             Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment when\n\n             applied against the offender under the age of 16.\n\n      {¶91} Two decades later, relying on similar rationales concerning the\n\n             developmental differences between children and adults, the Court\n\n             expanded that prohibition of death sentences for children to include\n\n             all juveniles under the age of 18, and that was Roper v. Simmons.\n\n             Following Roper, the Supreme Court of the United States * * * held\n\n             constitutionally   impermissible       sentences   of   life   without   the\n\n             possibility of parole for juvenile offenders convicted of crime other\n\n             than homicide, and that was in the Graham case.\n\n      {¶92} Then the Miller case came before the Supreme Court of the United\n\n             States only two years later.\n\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       {¶93} The Court extended Graham to bar mandatory life sentences\n\n              without parole for juveniles who commit homicide.\n\n       {¶94} Now, in doing so, the high court recognized and adhered to\n\n              Graham and perhaps Roper’s rationale and foundational principle\n\n              that the imposition of a state’s most severe penalty on a juvenile\n\n              offender cannot proceed as though they were not children.\n\n       {¶95} Appellant’s trial counsel then stated as follows:\n\n       {¶96} Respectfully, today, I move your Honor to fashion a sentence that\n\n              reflects the reality of [appellant’s] mental and psychiatric states. I\n\n              ask this of your Honor even in the face of almost certain disdain for\n\n              [appellant] because the law deems important that he was a juvenile\n\n              at the time.\n\n       {¶97} The prosecutor took no exception with the foregoing as being a\n\nfunctionally adequate recitation for purposes of sentencing appellant. And unlike Long,\n\nthe prosecutor did not argue that appellant’s youth justified a maximum sentence.\n\n       {¶98} It was against this backdrop that the trial court considered all Miller factors\n\nand afforded each one proper weight based on the particular facts of this case. That\n\nsome of the Miller factors did not favor appellant at sentencing does not mean that the\n\ntrial court failed to consider appellant’s youth as mitigating.\n\n       {¶99} Accordingly, despite the lack of an explicit statement from the trial court\n\nthat it considered this juvenile offender’s youth as mitigating, the record reflects that it\n\ndid so. The trial court simply found that, even considering the mitigating factors set forth\n\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\fin Miller, life without the possibility of parole was warranted.      That conclusion is a\n\nfunction of the facts, not a breakdown in the process.\n\n       {¶100} Thus, the trial court’s sentence complied with Miller. Further, while the\n\nOhio Supreme Court had not yet decided Long II when appellant was sentenced,\n\nbecause the Court in Long II explicitly followed Miller, by considering the Miller factors in\n\nfashioning appellant’s sentence, the trial court also complied with Long II. The trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the Miller factors is summarized as follows:\n\n       {¶101} First, the trial court considered appellant’s age and level of maturity. The\n\ncourt noted he was 17 and one-half years old at the time of his crimes. He was an\n\nintelligent student planning to graduate early and to attend college. He considered\n\nhimself to be mature for his age. He suffered no mental or cognitive impairment. He\n\nwas not insane, incompetent, or impaired at any relevant time. The court noted that,\n\nwhile there were and are no mental impairment issues, appellant feigned symptoms of\n\nmental illness when interacting with Dr. Resnick and the jail staff. The court noted that\n\nappellant knew what he did was wrong. This is why he hid his weapons in his book\n\nbag; fled from the school after the shooting; and acknowledged his wrongdoing soon\n\nafter he was apprehended.\n\n       {¶102} Second, the trial court considered appellant’s home and family\n\nenvironment. The court noted that he had a tumultuous upbringing, both as an infant\n\nand as an adolescent. His parents lost custody of him when he was three years old\n\nbecause they did not properly care for him.        However, since that time, appellant’s\n\nmaternal grandparents have provided a home for him; have raised him; and have been\n\nloving and caring guardians. The court noted that appellant sought to better himself by\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fholding various jobs and transferring to Lake Academy, which allowed him to work while\n\ngoing to school.\n\n       {¶103} Third, the trial court stated that “[m]any juvenile offenders are manipulated\n\nor pressured into committing crime by adults or peers who urge or incite the juvenile to\n\ncommit crimes. They prey upon the vulnerability of an impressionable youth. * * * That\n\ndidn’t occur here. These crimes were all Defendant’s, and [he] was not an\n\nimpressionable youth. * * * He did this on his own.” The court noted that appellant\n\nplanned, prepared for, and executed this scheme by himself. He was not manipulated or\n\npressured by anyone into committing these crimes. He confided in no one and he had\n\nno accomplice. The court explicitly stated that it considered each of the foregoing\n\nfactors in imposing sentence.\n\n       {¶104} Fourth, the court considered the circumstances of appellant’s offenses\n\nand the extent of his participation in them. The court noted that appellant planned his\n\nattack long before the shootings and methodically carried out that plan. He stole a\n\nhandgun, two magazines, and bullets from his uncle the day before the shootings. The\n\nnight before, he loaded both magazines and put one in the gun. The morning before,\n\nhe put the gun, the spare magazine, and a knife in his book bag, and hid them there\n\nuntil he took them out in the cafeteria. He intentionally dressed the part by wearing a\n\nshirt with the word “Killer” labeled across the chest. Further, appellant was relentless in\n\nhis shooting. He ambushed eight unsuspecting students who were talking with each\n\nother and did nothing to provoke him. He shot six students in the cafeteria resulting in\n\nthe death of three of them. While students and faculty were running out of the cafeteria\n\nand down the hallway, appellant aimed his gun at an adult monitor who was running\n\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\fafter him to prevent him from chasing him. While in the hallway, appellant ran up to\n\nNick Walczak, who appellant had shot in the cafeteria, and shot him again from behind.\n\nAppellant emptied the magazine in the gun of all ten of its shells. Further, the court\n\nnoted that the nature of the injuries and their impact on the victims and their families\n\nwere particularly unusual and intense. All six victims were juveniles who had lives filled\n\nwith potential. Those who were killed have been deprived of their lives. The survivors\n\nand their families have suffered devastating physical pain and psychological injury, and\n\nthey face a future that is forever tainted by appellant’s conduct. Nick is paralyzed and\n\nconfined to a wheelchair, severely challenged physically and psychologically, with a\n\nserious economic impact on his family.\n\n       {¶105} In addition, the court noted that appellant never stated his motive for this\n\nmerciless rampage. The court noted that, while being interrogated, appellant said he\n\ndid not know why he shot people. He said it was just something he chose to do. The\n\ncourt stated that, while appellant’s motive was unclear, it appeared he wanted to make\n\na name for himself and to make front page news. Thus, it was no coincidence that on\n\nthe day of the shootings, appellant boldly and brazenly wore a shirt that displayed\n\nacross his chest the word “Killer.” The court stated that because appellant attacked\n\nwithout discernible motive or provocation, appellant is “extremely dangerous.”\n\n       {¶106} Further, the court noted that appellant has shown no remorse, making him\n\nmore likely to re-offend. In his interview with the detectives, appellant said that after he\n\nfired the first few rounds, he regretted it and felt terrible. However, the court noted that\n\nhe repeatedly shot his gun at students in the cafeteria and in the hall until all rounds in\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fthe clip were fired. Further, when he was informed at the Safety Center during his\n\ninterview that one of his victims had died, he showed no remorse.\n\n      {¶107} We also note that appellant’s conduct at sentencing showed a complete\n\nlack of remorse.\n\n      {¶108} This case is distinguishable from Long II. In that case, the trial court did\n\nnot even mention at sentencing that Long was a juvenile when he committed his\n\noffenses. As a result, the Ohio Supreme Court stated it could not be sure how the trial\n\ncourt applied this factor. Id. at ¶27. Further, in Long II, the trial court had conducted a\n\ngroup sentencing of Long and his two adult accomplices at the same time. As a result,\n\nthe Supreme Court in Long II stated that Long might not have been given the benefit of\n\nthe consideration of youth as a mitigating factor. Id. at ¶28. In contrast, here, the trial\n\ncourt explicitly considered the mitigating factors of appellant’s youth on the record.\n\nFurther, in weighing appellant’s youth against other pertinent factors, including the\n\nnature of the crimes and appellant’s participation in them, the court found these factors\n\noutweighed the mitigating factors of appellant’s youth.\n\n      {¶109} In summary, the trial court was not bound by a mandatory sentencing\n\nscheme, and considered the factors outlined in Miller in imposing sentence. Moreover,\n\nby complying with Miller, the trial court also complied with Long II. Further, we cannot\n\nsay appellant’s sentence of life in prison without parole is so disproportionate to the\n\ncrimes he committed as to shock the community’s sense of justice.                Although\n\nappellant’s sentence is severe, it is not disproportionately so. He shot six students in\n\nschool, three of whom were killed and another paralyzed, without provocation and in\n\ncold blood. The horrific and senseless nature of this homicide is compounded by the\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\ffact that, at sentencing, appellant showed no remorse and even contempt for his victims\n\nand their families. In addition, appellant’s sentence was within the statutory range for\n\neach count of which he was convicted. We therefore hold that appellant’s sentence did\n\nnot amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       {¶110} Appellant’s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n       {¶111} For his third assignment of error, appellant alleges:\n\n       {¶112} “THE APPELLANT RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL\n\nCOUNSEL, IN VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO SUCH.”\n\nIneffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n\n       {¶113} Appellant argues that if this court holds the issues raised in his first two\n\nassignments of error, i.e., his mandatory bindover and his life-without-parole sentence,\n\nwere not preserved for appeal, then his trial counsel was ineffective in not doing so.\n\n       {¶114} In order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the\n\ndefendant must satisfy a two-prong test.          First, he must show that counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).\n\nSecond, the defendant must show the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Id.\n\nIn order to satisfy this prong, “[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel’s * * * errors, the result of the [trial] would have been\n\ndifferent.” Id. at 694. In the context of a guilty plea, the defendant must demonstrate that\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel’s errors, he would not have\n\npled guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial. State v. Curd, 11th Dist.\n\nLake No. 2003-L-030, 2004-Ohio-7222, ¶110.\n\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\f          {¶115} With respect to appellant’s argument that his attorney failed to object and\n\nthus failed to preserve his challenge to his mandatory bindover, since we hold that\n\nappellant did not waive this challenge, he was not prejudiced by his attorney’s failure to\n\nobject.\n\n          {¶116} Next, with respect to appellant’s argument that his attorney failed to\n\npreserve his constitutional challenge to his life-without-parole sentence by not\n\npresenting any constitutional argument in support of his objection, we note that in\n\naddition to trial counsel’s objection to appellant’s sentence, counsel also cited Miller,\n\nGraham, and Roper.          Further, the state concedes on appeal that appellant’s trial\n\ncounsel specifically objected to appellant’s sentence and preserved this issue for\n\nappeal. Because appellant’s trial counsel raised this issue in the trial court, the issue\n\nwas preserved and counsel’s performance was not deficient.\n\n          {¶117} We therefore hold that appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of\n\ntrial counsel.\n\n          {¶118} Appellant’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n          {¶119} For his fourth and final assigned error, appellant contends:\n\n          {¶120} “THE TRIAL COURT’S IMPOSITION OF CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES\n\nUPON THE APPELLANT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TRIAL COURT’S FINDINGS.”\n\nAppellant’s Consecutive Sentences\n\n          {¶121} Because appellant argues his consecutive sentences were not supported\n\nby the trial court’s findings, we review his sentence pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a).\n\nThat section provides that the appellate court may vacate the sentence and remand the\n\nmatter to the sentencing court for resentencing if the appellate court clearly and\n\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fconvincingly finds that the record does not support the sentencing court’s findings under\n\nR.C. 2929.14(C).\n\n      {¶122} The Eighth District recently stated in State v. Venes, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga\n\nNo. 98682, 2013-Ohio-1891:\n\n      {¶123} It is * * * important to understand that the clear and convincing\n\n      standard used by R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) is written in the negative. It does not\n\n      say that the trial judge must have clear and convincing evidence to\n\n      support its findings. Instead, it is the court of appeals that must clearly and\n\n      convincingly find that the record does not support the court’s findings. In\n\n      other words, the restriction is on the appellate court, not the trial judge.\n\n      This is an extremely deferential standard of review. Venes, supra, at ¶ 21.\n\n      {¶124} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), consecutive sentences can be imposed if\n\nthe court finds that (1) consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from\n\nfuture crime or to punish the offender and that (2) consecutive sentences are not\n\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and to the danger the\n\noffender poses to the public. In addition to these two factors, the court must find, as\n\npertinent here, that at least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one\n\nor more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the multiple\n\noffenses was so great or unusual that no one prison term for any of the offenses\n\nadequately reflects the seriousness of the offender’s conduct. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b).\n\n      {¶125} Subsequent to this amendment in the consecutive sentencing law, Ohio\n\nAppellate Districts have held that R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires trial courts to make the\n\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\fforegoing findings when imposing consecutive sentences. State v. Koeser, 11th Dist.\n\nPortage No. 2013-P-0041, 2013-Ohio-5838, ¶21.\n\n       {¶126} However, while the requirement that fact-finding occur was re-enacted by\n\nH.B. 86, the requirement that a sentencing court give reasons for imposing consecutive\n\nsentences, which existed under former R.C. 2929.19(B)(2), was not re-enacted.\n\nKoeser, supra, at ¶22. Thus, a sentencing court is not statutorily required to give\n\nreasons for its findings. Id.\n\n       {¶127} Turning now to the instant case, the trial court complied with R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4) in finding that: (1) consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the\n\npublic from future crime and to punish appellant; (2) consecutive sentences are not\n\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct and to the danger he poses to the\n\npublic; and (3) appellant committed two or more of these offenses as part of one or\n\nmore courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the offenses was so\n\ngreat or unusual that no one prison term for any of the offenses adequately reflects the\n\nseriousness of his conduct.\n\n       {¶128} Further, we note the court’s findings were supported by the record. In\n\naddition, while the court was not required to provide reasons in support of its findings,\n\nthe trial court did so and the court’s reasons were also supported by the record.\n\n       {¶129} In fact, appellant does not dispute that the trial court made the findings\n\nrequired by R.C. 2929.14(C). Nor does he deny that these findings were supported by\n\nthe record. Instead, he argues that this case is no more serious than many other\n\naggravated murder cases in which consecutive sentences are not imposed, making\n\nconsecutive sentences inappropriate here. Thus, his argument challenges only the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\fcourt’s imposition of consecutive sentences for his aggravated murder offenses, not the\n\nremaining crimes.    Further, nothing in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) suggests that a different\n\nappellate standard of review, let alone the standard suggested by appellant, applies in\n\nthe case of multiple counts of aggravated murder.\n\n       {¶130} In any event, we cannot agree with appellant’s argument that this case is\n\nnot sufficiently serious to warrant consecutive sentences.      Appellant did not act on\n\nimpulse, on provocation, or under pressure from peers or adults. To the contrary, he\n\nplanned this attack weeks in advance before he went to school that day with a loaded\n\ngun. He shot three young students to death. He shot another student several times,\n\nconfining him to a wheelchair and subjecting him to a life of pain and disability.\n\nAppellant also brought indescribable pain, grief, and lifelong tragedy to the victims’\n\nfamilies.\n\n       {¶131} Applying the appellate standard of review in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), we do\n\nnot clearly and convincingly find that the record does not support the trial court’s\n\nfindings under R.C. 2929.14(C).\n\n       {¶132} Appellant’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶133} For the reasons stated in the opinion of this court, appellant’s\n\nassignments of error lack merit and are overruled. It is the judgment and order of this\n\ncourt that the judgment of the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\n\n\nTIMOTHY P. CANNON, P.J.,\n\nTHOMAS R.

Lane, III, appeals his conviction in the Geauga\n\nCounty Court of Common Pleas following his guilty plea to three counts of aggravated\n\nmurder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder, and felonious assault. Appellant’s\n\nconviction resulted from a shooting at Chardon High School in which he killed three\n\nstudents, paralyzed another, and injured two others.        At the time of the offenses,\n\nappellant was 17 years old. At issue is whether Ohio’s mandatory juvenile bindover\n\fstatutes, at R.C. 2152.10 and R.C. 2152.12, are unconstitutional and whether\n\nappellant’s sentence to life in prison without parole violates the prohibition against cruel\n\nand unusual punishment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nSubstantive Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {¶2}   On March 1, 2012, a complaint was filed in the Geauga County Juvenile\n\nCourt, charging appellant with three counts of aggravated murder by shooting and killing\n\nthree students at Chardon High School, two counts of attempted aggravated murder\n\nagainst two other students, and one count of felonious assault against another student.\n\nOn the same date, the state moved to transfer this case to the General Division of the\n\nCourt of Common Pleas for appellant to be tried as an adult.\n\n       {¶3}   On March 21, 2012, the juvenile court ordered Phillip Resnick, M.D.,\n\nforensic psychiatrist, to complete a competency evaluation to determine whether\n\nappellant was competent to assist his attorneys in the juvenile court proceedings. On\n\nMay 2, 2012, the juvenile court held a competency hearing. Following the hearing, the\n\ncourt found that appellant was competent for purposes of the juvenile proceedings.\n\n       {¶4}   On May 24, 2012, the juvenile court held a bindover hearing. Following\n\nthe hearing, the court found that appellant was 17 years old on the date of the alleged\n\noffenses. The court also found that probable cause existed to believe that appellant\n\ncommitted three counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted aggravated\n\nmurder, which are “category one offenses” under R.C. 2152.02(B)(B), mandating\n\nbindover under R.C. 2152.10 and R.C. 2152.12.            As a result, the juvenile court\n\ntransferred appellant’s case to the general division.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f      {¶5}   On June 4, 2012, appellant was indicted in a six-count indictment charging\n\nhim with aggravated murder of Demetrius Hewlin, an unclassified felony, in violation of\n\nR.C. 2903.01(A) (Count One), with a multiple-killings death penalty specification, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and a firearm specification, in violation of R.C.\n\n2941.145(A); aggravated murder of Russell King, Jr. (Count Two), with the same death\n\npenalty specification and a firearm specification; aggravated murder of Daniel Parmertor\n\n(Count Three), with the same death penalty specification and a firearm specification;\n\nattempted aggravated murder of Nate Mueller, a felony of the first degree, in violation of\n\nR.C. 2903.01(A) and R.C. 2923.02(A) (Count Four), with a firearm specification;\n\nattempted aggravated murder of Nicholas Walczak (Count Five), with a firearm\n\nspecification; and felonious assault of Joy Rickers, a felony of the second degree, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) (Count Six), with a firearm specification. Appellant pled\n\nnot guilty. Subsequently, he pled not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\n      {¶6}   On February 8, 2013, appellant filed a motion for an order referring him for\n\na competency evaluation by the Psycho-Diagnostic Clinic.          The court granted the\n\nmotion. In her evaluation, Lynn A. Luna Jones, Ph.D., forensic psychologist, concluded\n\nthat appellant was competent to stand trial.\n\n      {¶7}   On February 26, 2013, the trial court held a competency hearing, after\n\nwhich the court found appellant was competent to stand trial. Later that day, he filed a\n\nwritten guilty plea and the court held a change-of-plea hearing. After waiving his rights,\n\nappellant withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, and pled guilty to each\n\ncount of the indictment. Pursuant to the parties’ plea bargain, appellant pled guilty to\n\nthe aggravated murder of Demetrius Hewlin, Russell King, Jr., and Daniel Parmertor in\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fCounts One, Two, and Three, respectively, and the firearm specifications to those\n\ncounts. Further, appellant pled guilty to attempted aggravated murder of Nate Mueller\n\nand Nicholas Walczak in Courts Four and Five, respectively, and the firearm\n\nspecifications to those counts. Finally, appellant pled guilty to Count Six, felonious\n\nassault of Joy Rickers, and the firearm specification to that count. In exchange for his\n\nplea, the death penalty specifications were dismissed.\n\n       {¶8}   In support of the factual basis for the guilty plea, the state offered: (1) the\n\nvideo recording of appellant’s crimes, (2) the dash cam video of his apprehension by\n\nGeauga County Sheriff’s Deputy Jon Bilicic, and (3) the video of appellant’s confession\n\ngiven to detectives at the Geauga County Safety Center.\n\n       {¶9}   The video taken from a security camera in the school cafeteria shows that\n\non February 27, 2012, at about 7:30 a.m., appellant is sitting alone at a table in the\n\ncafeteria with his book bag on the table. He watches a group of eight to nine students\n\nwho are talking to each other at a nearby table. Appellant then moves to a table directly\n\nbehind this group of students and continues to watch them. One of these students, Nick\n\nWalczak, is standing at the end of the table and the others are seated, some with their\n\nbacks to appellant and others facing in his direction.\n\n       {¶10} After watching these students for about eight minutes, appellant goes\n\nthrough his book bag. He pulls out a handgun and a knife, stands, aims his gun at the\n\ngroup of students in front of him, and starts shooting. Appellant shoots Russell King in\n\nthe back of the head. He also shoots Nick Walczak who falls to the floor. Appellant then\n\nwalks around his table and along the victims’ table while repeatedly shooting at them.\n\nHe shoots Demetrius Hewlin in the head and also shoots Daniel Parmertor in the head.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fTwo other students, Nate Mueller and Joy Rickers, are also shot. Everyone in the\n\ncafeteria runs out. Appellant also runs out of the cafeteria with his gun and knife.\n\n       {¶11} The video taken by a security camera in the adjoining hallway shows a\n\nlarge group of students running frantically from the cafeteria and down the hallway.\n\nWhile Nick Walczak is limping down the hallway, appellant runs up to him from behind\n\nand shoots him again, this time in the back of his neck at close range. While appellant\n\nis running up to Nick, one can see across the chest of appellant’s long-sleeve, pullover\n\nshirt in large bold letters the word, “Killer.” Nick falls to the floor and appellant runs\n\naway from him.\n\n       {¶12} Meanwhile, Deputy Bilicic, while on routine patrol, was advised of the\n\nshooting and given a description of the suspect. The deputy was told that the suspect\n\nhad fled the high school. At about 8:30 a.m., Deputy Bilicic was dispatched to Woodin\n\nRoad, about one mile from the school, and advised the suspect was at that location.\n\nWhen Deputy Bilicic approached the area, he saw appellant sitting on the side of the\n\nroad with his handgun and knife near him. After Deputy Bilicic advised appellant of his\n\nMiranda rights, he said he just shot people at the high school.\n\n       {¶13} Deputy Bilicic drove appellant to the Geauga County Safety Center where\n\nhe was interviewed by two Geauga County Sheriff’s detectives.           After again being\n\nadvised of his Miranda rights, appellant said that at about 7:00 that morning, he rode the\n\nschool bus to Chardon High School.          He went in the school with a .22-caliber,\n\nsemiautomatic Ruger handgun and a knife he had put in his book bag. He said he\n\nbrought the gun because he planned to shoot people. He brought the knife in case he\n\nneeded another weapon while reloading his gun. He said he went in and out of the\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fbathroom three times because he wanted to shoot students and was thinking about\n\ndoing it. He said that when he left the bathroom for the last time, he sat alone at a table\n\ndirectly behind a group of students he was going to shoot so he would be close to them.\n\n       {¶14} Appellant said that at about 7:30 a.m., he switched the safety off on the\n\ngun. He then pulled his pistol and knife out of his book bag. He stood up and, while\n\naiming at the group, fired all ten rounds in the clip. He realized he needed to reload his\n\ngun so he ran out of the cafeteria. Appellant said that as he left the cafeteria, an adult\n\ncafeteria monitor started following him so appellant spun around and aimed his gun at\n\nhim so he would not chase him. Appellant then ran down the hallway and exited the\n\nbuilding.\n\n       {¶15} Appellant said that after he ran out of the school, he dropped the empty\n\nclip out of the gun and loaded it with a second clip. He ran into the woods until he\n\nreached a road. He sat down on the side of the road until Deputy Bilicic approached\n\nhim.\n\n       {¶16} Appellant said he did not know why he did this. He said he does not have\n\nproblems with anyone and was not upset with anyone. He said that no one had bullied\n\nhim. This was just something he chose to do. He said that by doing this he was trying\n\nto accomplish something. He said he created this goal and he needed to see it through.\n\nHe said he had been thinking about doing this for about two weeks.\n\n       {¶17} Appellant said he stole the gun the day before the shooting from his uncle\n\nwhile he was visiting him. He also stole a second magazine and a handful of bullets\n\nthat were stored with the gun. When he stole the gun it was empty. The night before\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthe shooting, he loaded both magazines and put one of them in the gun. He put the gun\n\nin his book bag that morning because he felt he would probably shoot people.\n\n         {¶18} Appellant said he did not choose any particular people to shoot. Rather,\n\nhe said he shot at a random group of people. He said that, while he had seen these\n\nstudents before, he did not know them. He said he aimed at their heads so they would\n\ndie quicker and not suffer.\n\n         {¶19} Appellant said he attended Chardon High School for the first half of ninth\n\ngrade.     Since then, he has attended Lake Academy, an alternative high school in\n\nWilloughby. He decided to go there because Lake Academy gives its students the\n\noption of working while going to school. He said he planned to work and earn money to\n\ngo to college. Every school day, he takes the school bus to Chardon High School,\n\nwhich arrives there at about 7:00 a.m. He does not take classes there. He just waits in\n\nthe cafeteria for about one-half hour until 7:30 a.m., when he catches a bus that takes\n\nhim to Auburn Career Center in Concord Township. From there, he takes another bus\n\nto Lake Academy. Appellant said he shot the students while he was waiting for the bus\n\nto take him to Auburn Career Center.\n\n         {¶20} Appellant said he is in the eleventh grade, but also takes twelfth grade\n\nclasses. He was going to graduate that year so he would be graduating early. He was\n\nplanning to go to college to study psychology. He believes he is more mature than\n\nothers his age.\n\n         {¶21} Appellant said he bought the shirt with the word “Killer” printed across the\n\nchest about one week earlier. He said he wore it today because he was going to be\n\nshooting people.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       {¶22} In response to the detectives’ questions, appellant insisted he never shot\n\nanyone while he was running down the hallway.\n\n       {¶23} Appellant said he shot a lot of bullets into a small group of people and\n\nthought someone would be killed. He said he knows what he did was wrong; he feels\n\nterrible for doing it; and he has regret.\n\n       {¶24} Appellant said he has lived with his maternal grandparents since he was\n\nabout three years old. He said that at that time, the court decided his parents were not\n\nfit to raise him and his grandparents were awarded custody.\n\n       {¶25} Dr. Lynn A. Luna Jones of the Psycho-Diagnostic Clinic stated in her\n\ncompetency report that during appellant’s prior competency evaluation with Dr. Resnick,\n\nappellant told him that he had heard voices and experienced delusions.        However,\n\nappellant admitted to Dr. Jones that he has never actually experienced any of these\n\nsymptoms. Appellant admitted he “lied” to Dr. Resnick when he told him he had heard\n\nvoices. With regard to appellant’s report to Dr. Resnick that he experienced anxiety and\n\nconfusion, he denied that he ever felt that way. He also denied he had any prior fears\n\nof losing his mind, as he had previously reported. Appellant said he reported these\n\nsymptoms because he was trying to appear schizophrenic. Finally, he said he lied\n\nabout his report of being a victim of sexual abuse because he thought it “couldn’t hurt”\n\nto say he was.\n\n       {¶26} Appellant said he was able to successfully manipulate Ravenwood mental\n\nhealth staff at the jail to believe he was mentally ill. He said he feigned symptoms of\n\nbeing depressed, suicidal, sexually abused, psychotic, and schizophrenic. He said he\n\nwas able to “force [himself] to cry when necessary to convince staff he was depressed.”\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fHe said he told staff he was claustrophobic so he could be put in with the general jail\n\npopulation instead of being segregated from the other inmates. Regarding the voices\n\nhe reported to staff at the Geauga County Safety Center, appellant said he “made it all\n\nup.”\n\n       {¶27} When Dr. Jones asked appellant why he decided to change his report of\n\nmental health symptoms, he said he “was afraid that if [he] didn’t come clean, they\n\nwouldn’t let me change my plea to guilty.”\n\n       {¶28} Dr. Jones concluded that appellant has no mental condition or defect and\n\nhas no signs of delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, or psychosis. She further\n\nconcluded that appellant fabricated these symptoms in order to evade prosecution.\n\n       {¶29} The court found that appellant voluntarily entered his guilty plea; accepted\n\nhis guilty plea; and found him guilty of each count of the indictment. The court ordered\n\na pre-sentence report and scheduled the matter for sentencing.\n\n       {¶30} The case proceeded to sentencing on March 19, 2013. After taking his\n\nseat at the defense table, appellant took off his dress shirt, revealing an undershirt with\n\nthe word “Killer” written on it similar to the shirt he wore on February 27, 2012.\n\nAppellant’s counsel told the court that appellant is now 18 years old, and had instructed\n\nhim not to present any mitigation on his behalf. Instead, he said appellant wanted to\n\nmake a statement on his own behalf. Counsel said that he had urged him not to make\n\nthe statement he expected appellant to make, but that he has the right to make it.\n\n       {¶31} Appellant told the court he voluntarily and against the advice of his\n\ncounsel waived his right to present information in mitigation of punishment. Appellant\n\nthen turned around and, with his middle finger raised toward the victims’ families, said to\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fthem: “This hand that pulled the trigger, that killed your sons, now masturbates to the\n\nmemory. F_ _ _ all of you.”\n\n      {¶32} Phyllis Ferguson, Demetrius Hewlin’s mother, stated that appellant’s\n\nmurder of her son has devastated the lives of every member of their family. She spoke\n\nof how kind and unselfish Demetrius was. Ms. Ferguson said that whenever her back\n\nhurt, Demetrius would put her shoes on and tie them for her. She said that appellant\n\nstole her son’s life and he should never be allowed to do this to anyone again.\n\n      {¶33} Holly Walczak, Nick Walczak’s mother, while looking at appellant, said,\n\n“You can smile all you want.” She told appellant that because he took a gun to school\n\nand shot innocent students, he changed the lives of every member of her family and\n\ntheir quiet, peaceful town will never be the same.      Her son is now paralyzed and\n\nconfined to a wheelchair. She said that Nick had driven appellant home from school\n\nand was always kind to him, and she asked appellant why he would want to hurt Nick.\n\nShe thus debunked appellant’s statement to the detectives that he did not know his\n\nvictims. She told the court she watches her son suffer daily as a result of his injuries.\n\nShe asked the court to never release appellant from prison because he is dangerous\n\nand has caused too much pain.\n\n      {¶34} Crystal King, Russell King’s older sister, told the court that the murder of\n\nher brother has been the most difficult thing she has ever had to endure. She said she\n\nwas driving to work on February 27, 2012, when her fiancé called her and said there\n\nhad been a shooting at the high school. She called Russell’s cell phone over and over,\n\nbut there was no answer. She called her father. When he answered, he could hardly\n\nbreathe. She asked if he had heard anything, and he said, “he’s been shot.” Her\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fparents picked her up from work and drove her to the hospital. The doctor said it was\n\nvery bad. He said Russell had been shot in the head and was in surgery and if he\n\nmade it, he would be disabled. They went in the waiting room, which was filled with so\n\nmany people, the hospital staff moved them to a conference room. She said she does\n\nnot remember seeing any faces, just a sea of friends and family members that filled the\n\nentire hallway. Realizing that all these people were there for her brother brought tears\n\nto her eyes. She then returned to Russell’s room. As she walked in, her mother was\n\nyelling, “no, no, no,” over and over again. Crystal learned that Russell had just passed\n\naway. She said that appellant took not only the life of her only sibling and her parents’\n\nonly son, he also took the sense of safety from every parent in the community who\n\nsends their children to school. She said that appellant took so much away from so\n\nmany people, he deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison without parole. Like\n\nHolly Walczak, Crystal said that Russell and appellant used to be friends, again\n\ncontradicting appellant’s statement to police that he did not know his victims.\n\n       {¶35} Finally, Dina Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor’s mother, told the court that\n\nappellant murdered her son Danny who was just 16 years old. She said she will suffer\n\nthe rest of her life without her son. She is in pain every minute of every day. She no\n\nlonger wants to enjoy life or visit with family and friends. She will never be the same\n\nbecause of appellant. She said that appellant has stolen her life. She said he also stole\n\nDanny from his little brother and sister. Her younger children do not see the mother\n\nthey used to know because she is in constant anguish. They want to help her, but they\n\nare in too much pain themselves. She said she sees no remorse from appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f         {¶36} The court sentenced appellant on Count One, the aggravated murder of\n\nDemetrius Hewlin, to life in prison without parole; on Count Two, the aggravated murder\n\nof Russell King, Jr., to life in prison without parole; and on Count Three, the aggravated\n\nmurder of Daniel Parmertor, to life in prison without parole. With respect to Count Four,\n\nthe attempted aggravated murder of Nate Mueller, the court sentenced appellant to\n\neight years in prison.     On Count Five, the attempted aggravated murder of Nick\n\nWalczak, the court found that, after shooting Nick, appellant chased him down the\n\nhallway as Nick was running for his life. Appellant sprinted up behind him and shot him\n\nfrom behind. Nick is now paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. The court noted that\n\nappellant’s conduct merits the maximum sentence of 11 years in prison. On Count Six,\n\nthe felonious assault of Joy Rickers, the court sentenced appellant to six years in\n\nprison. Each of these prison terms was ordered to be served consecutively to each\n\nother.\n\n         {¶37} The court also imposed three-year prison terms for four of the firearm\n\nspecifications to Counts One, Two, Three, and Five, the aggravated murders and the\n\nattempted aggravated murder of Nick Walczak, based on appellant’s overall objectives\n\nin his criminal enterprise and the serious injuries he inflicted. The court noted that these\n\nfour victims suffered the most extreme injury, the three murdered victims having lost\n\ntheir lives and Nick being confined to a wheelchair. These terms were ordered to be\n\nserved consecutively to the prison terms imposed for each of the four underlying\n\nfelonies.\n\n         {¶38} Thus, in addition to the three life terms for the aggravated murders, the\n\ncourt imposed a total of 25 years in prison on the other offenses and 12 years for the\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\ffirearm specifications, all of which were ordered to be served consecutively, for a total of\n\n37 years in prison.\n\n       {¶39} Appellant     appeals    his   conviction    and    sentence,    asserting   four\n\nassignments of error.     Because his first two assigned errors are related, they are\n\nconsidered together. They allege:\n\n       {¶40} “[1.] THE JUVENILE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN, REVERSIBLE\n\nERROR BY BINDING APPELLANT OVER TO THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS TO\n\nBE TRIED AS AN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS (SIC).\n\n       {¶41} “[2.] THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR, AS A MATTER\n\nOF LAW, BY SENTENCING APPELLANT TO THREE TERMS OF INCARCERATION\n\nOF   LIFE    WITHOUT       THE    POSSIBILITY       OF    PAROLE,      IN    VIOLATION    OF\n\nAPPELLANT’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.”\n\nEffect of Appellant’s Guilty Plea on His Constitutional Challenge to Mandatory\n\nBindover\n\n       {¶42} As a preliminary matter, the state argues that because appellant pled\n\nguilty, he waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio’s mandatory\n\nbindover statutes, at R.C. 2152.10 and R.C. 2152.12. In support, the state cites State v.\n\nQuarterman, 9th Dist.

Portage No. 89-P-2065,\n\n1990 Ohio App. LEXIS 3508 (Aug. 17, 1990), rejected this argument. In Platt, this court\n\nheld that a voluntary guilty plea waives all defects in the case, except the lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction of the court that accepted the plea. Id. at *4-*5. Further, this court\n\nheld that by entering a guilty plea, a juvenile does not waive objections to constitutional\n\ndeficiencies in the bindover hearing wherein the juvenile court transferred jurisdiction to\n\nthe general division.

We do not agree.\n\n       {¶46} A duly enacted Ohio statute enjoys “a strong presumption of\n\nconstitutionality.”   State v. Collier, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 (1991). Further, where\n\nreasonably possible, courts must interpret challenged statutes so as to avoid\n\nconstitutional infirmities. Akron v.

Before a\n\ncourt may declare a statute unconstitutional, the party challenging its constitutionality\n\nbears the heightened burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a clear conflict\n\nexists between the legislation and some particular constitutional provision.

Further, the constitutionality of a statute is a matter of law that we review\n\nde novo. State v. Jenson, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2005-L-193, 2006-Ohio-5169, ¶5.\n\n       {¶47} R.C. 2152.02(BB) provides that a “category one offense\" means\n\naggravated murder, murder, attempted aggravated murder, or attempted murder.\n\n       {¶48} Further, R.C. 2152.10(A)(1)(a) provides that a child who is alleged to be a\n\ndelinquent child is eligible for mandatory transfer and shall be transferred pursuant to\n\nR.C. 2152.12 if the child is charged with a category one offense, and the child was at\n\nleast 16 years old at the time of the offense.\n\n       {¶49} Moreover, R.C. 2152.12(A)(1)(a)(i) provides that after a complaint has\n\nbeen filed alleging that a child is a delinquent child for committing an act that would be\n\naggravated murder, murder, attempted aggravated murder, or attempted murder if\n\ncommitted by an adult, the juvenile court at a hearing shall transfer the case to the\n\ngeneral division if the child was 16 or 17 years old at the time of the offense and there is\n\nprobable cause to believe that the child committed the offense.           In explaining this\n\nstatute, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated:\n\n       {¶50} [The juvenile] court has a duty to transfer a case when it\n\n              determines that the elements of the transfer statute are met, to wit:\n\n              (1) the charged act would be aggravated murder, murder,\n\n              attempted aggravated murder, or attempted murder if committed by\n\n              an adult, (2) the child was 16 or 17 at the time of the act, [and] (3)\n\n              there is probable cause to believe that the child committed the act\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f               charged.

Although he does not expressly state whether his argument is\n\nbased on procedural or substantive due process, we interpret it as based on the former.\n\nState v. Lee, 11th Dist. Lake No. 97-L-091, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4250, *12 (Sep. 11,\n\n1998).\n\n         {¶52} Procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution and Section 15, Article I of the Ohio Constitution are identical and\n\nrequire that, before the state can divest a person of a right, he or she must be given\n\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard. Lee, supra.\n\n         {¶53} Appellant argues his due process rights were violated because Ohio’s\n\nbindover statutes do not provide for an amenability hearing at which the court considers\n\nthe factors set forth in Kent v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107191\"><a href=\"/opinion/107191/kent-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), before the juvenile\n\ncourt orders a bindover.\n\n         {¶54} In Kent, the District of Columbia’s bindover statute provided that the\n\njuvenile court may waive its jurisdiction over the juvenile, but did not provide any\n\ndefinitive bindover procedures.    After a motion for a bindover was filed, the judge\n\nsummarily and without any hearing or explanation ordered the juvenile to be held for\n\ntrial as an adult. The juvenile was then tried and convicted. The court of appeals\n\naffirmed. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the conviction on the\n\nground that due process required more procedure than was provided to the juvenile. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\fat 556. The Supreme Court in Kent held that in order to satisfy due process: (1) the\n\njuvenile court must hold a hearing, (2) at which the juvenile is represented by counsel,\n\nand (3) the juvenile court must provide a statement of reasons for its bindover decision.\n\nId. at 557. Further, the Court in Kent held that in deciding whether to order a bindover,\n\nthe juvenile court should consider certain listed factors. Id. at 566-567.\n\n       {¶55} As noted above, appellant argues that, pursuant to Kent, due process\n\nrequired an amenability hearing before he could be bound over to the general division.\n\nHowever, this court in Lee, supra, held that Kent does not stand for this proposition.\n\nLee, supra, at *15. As in this case, the defendant in Lee argued that Ohio’s mandatory\n\nbindover statutes violated due process because, in his view, he was entitled to an\n\namenability hearing pursuant to Kent.        However, this court in Lee held that the\n\ndefendant was granted the procedural protections required by Kent because a probable\n\ncause hearing was held at which the defendant was represented by counsel and the\n\ntrial court made findings of fact in support of its order transferring jurisdiction to the\n\ngeneral division. Lee, supra, at *15-*16. Further, this court in Lee held that due process\n\ndoes not require an amenability hearing. Id. at *16.\n\n       {¶56} Moreover, the Third District in State v. Kelly, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-98-26,\n\n1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 5630 (Nov. 18, 1998), also held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover\n\nstatutes do not violate due process. Id. at *22. As in the instant case, the defendant in\n\nKelly argued that, because the mandatory bindover statutes do not provide for an\n\namenability hearing at which juvenile courts are required to consider the factors listed in\n\nKent, supra, Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes violate due process.\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       {¶57} The Third District in Kelly noted that the bindover statute at issue in Kent\n\ninvolved discretionary, rather than mandatory, bindovers. The court in Kelly stated that,\n\nbecause the Kent factors were intended to address the problem of arbitrary decision-\n\nmaking and disparate treatment in discretionary bindover determinations, due process\n\ndoes not require use of these factors when the legislature has statutorily eliminated\n\ndiscretionary bindover determinations. Id. at *19-*20.\n\n       {¶58} The Third District in Kelly stated that due process does not require a\n\nweighing of specific factors prior to a transfer; it merely requires that such transfers not\n\nbe made on an arbitrary basis. Id. at *20. Thus, the court held that due process does\n\nnot prevent the General Assembly from eliminating the weighing of the Kent factors for\n\ncertain serious offenses, provided that removal is rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental purpose. Id. The court stated that, because an amenability hearing using\n\nthe Kent factors is not a fundamental right, the rational basis test applies, and, in\n\napplying that test, the court held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes are rationally\n\nrelated to the legitimate governmental objective of deterring violent juvenile crime. Id.\n\n       {¶59} The court in Kelly held that the procedural prerequisites to transfer\n\ndescribed in Kent, i.e., representation by counsel, a hearing, and a statement of\n\nreasons, are provided for in Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes. Kelly, supra, at *21.\n\nThus, the Third District held that the elimination of a separate amenability hearing does\n\nnot violate procedural due process. Id.\n\n       {¶60} Further, the Second and Ninth Districts have also held that Ohio’s\n\nmandatory bindover statutes do not violate due process. State v. Ramey, 2d Dist.\n\nMontgomery No. 16442, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2617, *2-*3 (May 22, 1998); State v.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\fCollins, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 97CA006845, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2474, *5 (June 3,\n\n1998).\n\n         {¶61} Moreover, appellant does not cite any case law holding that a mandatory\n\nbindover statute violates due process.\n\n         {¶62} Here, appellant was represented by counsel at a probable cause hearing\n\nheld by the juvenile court. Further, the juvenile court’s judgment entry included findings\n\nof fact supporting its decision transferring the matter to the general division. Based on\n\nthe foregoing authority, Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes do not violate due process.\n\nAppellant’s Equal Protection Challenge to Mandatory Bindover\n\n         {¶63} Next, appellant argues that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes violated\n\nhis right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution and Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n         {¶64} The standard for determining if a statute violates equal protection is\n\n“essentially the same under state and federal law.” Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police\n\nDept., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353 (1994). “Under a traditional equal protection analysis,\n\nclass distinctions in legislation are permissible if they bear some rational relationship to\n\na legitimate governmental objective. Departures from traditional equal protection\n\nprinciples are permitted only when burdens upon suspect classifications or\n\nabridgements of fundamental rights are involved.” State ex rel. Vana v. Maple Hts. City\n\nCouncil, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (1990). The bindover statutes do not affect a suspect\n\nclass (e.g., race or gender) or a fundamental right (e.g., speech or religion). Lee, supra,\n\nat *17. In fact, appellant concedes the rational basis test applies to his equal-protection\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fchallenge.   Thus, the bindover statutes need only bear a rational relationship to a\n\nlegitimate governmental purpose Adkins v. McFaul, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (1996).\n\n       {¶65} Appellant argues that no rational basis exists for the disparate treatment\n\nin the bindover statutes of juveniles who are 14 or 15 years old as opposed to those\n\nwho are 16 or 17 years old. Under the bindover statutes, juveniles who are 16 or 17 are\n\nsubject to mandatory bindover if probable cause exists to believe they committed a\n\ncategory one offense. In contrast, similarly-situated juveniles who are 14 or 15 are only\n\nsubject to mandatory bindover if they were previously adjudicated delinquent and\n\ncommitted to the department of youth services for committing a category one offense.\n\nR.C. 2152.10(A)(1)(b).\n\n       {¶66} Appellant contends that this disparate treatment is not supported by\n\nscientific evidence. However, as the party challenging the constitutionality of the\n\nstatutes, appellant had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statutes\n\nare unconstitutional, i.e., that the subject classification is not rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate governmental objective. Because appellant failed to meet this burden, he\n\nfailed to rebut the strong presumption that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes are\n\nconstitutional.\n\n       {¶67} In any event, the purpose of this legislation is to protect society and\n\nreduce violent crime by juveniles. Lee, supra, at *17. Contrary to appellant’s argument,\n\njuveniles who are 14 or 15 are markedly different from those who are 16 or 17 in many\n\nways, e.g., in terms of physical development and maturity. Juveniles who are 14 years\n\nold are typically still immature, while those who are 17, or in appellant’s case, 17 and\n\none-half years old, are nearly adults. Thus, the legislature’s decision to single out older\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fjuvenile homicide offenders, who are potentially more street-wise, hardened,\n\ndangerous, and violent, is rationally related to this legitimate governmental purpose.\n\n       {¶68} Further, this court in Lee, supra, has held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover\n\nstatutes do not violate equal protection. Id. at *17. In addition, the Second, Third, and\n\nNinth Districts have likewise held that Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes do not violate\n\nequal protection. Ramey, supra; Kelly, supra, at *26-*27; Collins, supra, at *5.\n\n       {¶69} Moreover, appellant does not cite any case law holding that a mandatory\n\nbindover statute violates equal protection.\n\n       {¶70} In view of the foregoing analysis, Ohio’s mandatory bindover statutes do\n\nnot violate equal protection.\n\nAppellant’s Eighth Amendment Challenge to Mandatory Bindover\n\n       {¶71} Next, appellant argues his bindover under Ohio’s mandatory bindover\n\nstatutes and his sentence to life in prison without parole violated the prohibition against\n\ncruel and unusual punishment pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio Constitution. “‘A punishment does not\n\nviolate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, if it be not\n\nso greatly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the sense of justice of the\n\ncommunity.’” State v. Dioneff, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2006-A-0063, 2007-Ohio-3387,\n\n¶79, quoting State v. Chaffin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n“‘Eighth Amendment violations are rare and instances of cruel and unusual punishment\n\nare limited to those punishments, which, under the circumstances, would be considered\n\nshocking to any reasonable person.’” Dioneff, supra, quoting State v. Rhodes, 11th Dist.\n\nLake No. 2000-L-089, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 5650, *21 (December 14, 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fSentences that fall within the statutory range cannot amount to cruel and unusual\n\npunishment. State v. Bengal, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2006-L-123, 2007-Ohio-2691, ¶17;\n\nState v. Gladding, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3761740\"><a href=\"/opinion/4007172/state-v-gladding/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (11th Dist.1990); State v. Long, 1st Dist.\n\nHamilton No. C-110160, 2012-Ohio-3052, (“Long I”), reversed on other grounds at\n\n____Ohio St.3d ____, 2014-Ohio-849.\n\n       {¶72} With respect to appellant’s argument that his mandatory bindover\n\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment, he does not cite any case law holding that\n\nthe mandatory transfer of juveniles to the general division without an amenability\n\nhearing constitutes punishment, let alone cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       {¶73} The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by its very terms\n\napplies only to punishments. The word “punishment” has been defined as follows: “In\n\ncriminal law[, a]ny * * * penalty * * * or confinement inflicted upon a person by authority\n\nof the * * * sentence of a court, for some crime or offense committed by him * * *.”\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1398 (4th Ed. Rev. 1968). Further, “[m]andatory bindover does\n\nnot equate to punishment any more than the mere prosecution of an adult in the\n\ncommon pleas court constitutes punishment.”        Quarterman, supra, at ¶16 (J. Carr,\n\nconcurring).\n\n       {¶74} Because appellant’s mandatory bindover was not a penalty or\n\nconfinement inflicted on him pursuant to a sentence of the juvenile court, it was not a\n\npunishment, and appellant’s mandatory bindover did not constitute cruel and unusual\n\npunishment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fAppellant’s Eighth Amendment Challenge to his Life-Without-Parole Sentence\n\n       {¶75} Appellant cites no case law holding that a sentence of life without parole\n\nimposed on a juvenile following his or her conviction of an intentional homicide amounts\n\nto cruel and unusual punishment. Instead, he relies on a trilogy of cases decided by the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court. However, each of these cases is inapposite as none\n\nholds that the sentence of a juvenile homicide offender to a discretionary sentence of\n\nlife without parole constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       {¶76} First, in Miller v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959737\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959737/miller-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), the United States\n\nSupreme Court held that a mandatory life-without-parole sentence for juvenile homicide\n\noffenders is cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 2469.\n\n       {¶77} However, Miller is distinguishable because appellant’s sentence of life\n\nwithout parole was discretionary, not mandatory. State v. Long, ____ Ohio St.3d ____,\n\n2014-Ohio-849 (“Long II”), ¶5. The trial court had the discretion to impose either life\n\nwithout parole or life with parole eligibility after serving a definite period of 20, 25, or 30\n\nyears. Id.; R.C. 2929.03(A)(1). Thus, “Ohio’s sentencing scheme does not [run] afoul\n\nof Miller, because the sentence of life without parole is discretionary.” Long II at ¶19.\n\n       {¶78} Next, in Roper v. Simmons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137749\"><a href=\"/opinion/137749/roper-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), the United States\n\nSupreme Court held that the imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders is\n\ncruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 575. However, Roper is distinguishable because\n\nappellant was not sentenced to death.\n\n       {¶79} Finally, in Graham v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150543\"><a href=\"/opinion/150543/graham-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010), the United States\n\nSupreme Court held that the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a juvenile\n\noffender who did not commit homicide is cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 82.\n\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fGraham is distinguishable since appellant was convicted of three counts of aggravated\n\nmurder.\n\n      {¶80} While none of these cases applies to appellant’s sentence, he essentially\n\nargues this court should extend their holdings to invalidate his life-without-parole\n\nsentence. However, appellant does not reference any pertinent authority supporting\n\nsuch extension. To the contrary, the Supreme Court in Miller, supra, stated that a\n\nsentencing court is not precluded from imposing a life-without-parole sentence on a\n\njuvenile homicide offender. Id. at 2469; accord Long II at ¶14.\n\n      {¶81} It is worth noting that in Graham, supra, the United States Supreme Court\n\nstated that 44 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government permit\n\nsentences of life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders. Id. at 2034-2036.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court’s Decision in Miller v. Alabama\n\n      {¶82} Pursuant to Miller, supra, a sentencing court must consider mitigating\n\ncircumstances, including the juvenile’s youth and its attendant circumstances, before a\n\njuvenile homicide offender can be sentenced to life without parole. Id. at 2475. The\n\nSupreme Court in Miller held that a mandatory sentence of life without parole imposed\n\non a juvenile is cruel and unusual punishment because such sentence:\n\n      {¶83} precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark\n\n             features--among them, [1] immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to\n\n             appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking into account\n\n             [2] the family and home environment that surrounds him--and from\n\n             which he cannot usually extricate himself--no matter how brutal or\n\n             dysfunctional. It neglects [3] the circumstances of the homicide\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\f              offense, including [4] the extent of his participation in the conduct\n\n              and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him. Id.\n\n              at 2468.\n\n       {¶84} The United States Supreme Court decided Miller in 2012, one year before\n\nappellant’s sentencing, which occurred in March 2013.\n\n       {¶85} In Long II, decided in 2014, the Supreme Court of Ohio expressly followed\n\nMiller in holding that a trial court, in sentencing a juvenile offender for aggravated\n\nmurder, must consider his youth as a mitigating factor before imposing a sentence of life\n\nwithout parole. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. Further, the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nin Long II held that the record must reflect that the court specifically considered the\n\njuvenile offender’s youth as a mitigating factor at sentencing when imposing a prison\n\nterm of life without parole. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶86} The Court in Long II stated that, “[a]lthough Miller does not require that\n\nspecific findings be made on the record, it does mandate that a trial court consider as\n\nmitigating the offender’s youth and attendant characteristics before imposing a sentence\n\nof life without parole.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at ¶27. The Court held that the offender’s\n\nyouth at the time of the offense must be “weighed against any statutory consideration\n\nthat might make an offense more serious or an offender more likely to recidivate.” Id. at\n\n¶19.   The Court stated that, because a life-without-parole sentence implies that\n\nrehabilitation is impossible, when the court imposes such sentence, its reasons for this\n\nsentence should be on the record. Id.\n\n       {¶87} Although appellant explicitly waived the right to present information in\n\nmitigation of punishment, appellant’s trial counsel fully informed the court that it was\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\frequired to consider appellant’s age as a mitigating factor.          He quoted a pleading\n\nrecently filed in the United States Supreme Court, as follows:\n\n      {¶88} Jurisprudence has been toward more not less protection for\n\n             juvenile offenders.\n\n      {¶89} This trend began in Thompson v. Oklahoma in which William\n\n             Thompson challenged a death sentence pronounced for his first\n\n             degree murder conviction which stemmed from his active\n\n             participation in a brutal murder at the age of 15.\n\n      {¶90} The Supreme Court of the United States held that regardless of the\n\n             underlying    crime,   the     death    penalty    violated    the   Eighth\n\n             Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment when\n\n             applied against the offender under the age of 16.\n\n      {¶91} Two decades later, relying on similar rationales concerning the\n\n             developmental differences between children and adults, the Court\n\n             expanded that prohibition of death sentences for children to include\n\n             all juveniles under the age of 18, and that was Roper v. Simmons.\n\n             Following Roper, the Supreme Court of the United States * * * held\n\n             constitutionally   impermissible       sentences   of   life   without   the\n\n             possibility of parole for juvenile offenders convicted of crime other\n\n             than homicide, and that was in the Graham case.\n\n      {¶92} Then the Miller case came before the Supreme Court of the United\n\n             States only two years later.\n\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       {¶93} The Court extended Graham to bar mandatory life sentences\n\n              without parole for juveniles who commit homicide.\n\n       {¶94} Now, in doing so, the high court recognized and adhered to\n\n              Graham and perhaps Roper’s rationale and foundational principle\n\n              that the imposition of a state’s most severe penalty on a juvenile\n\n              offender cannot proceed as though they were not children.\n\n       {¶95} Appellant’s trial counsel then stated as follows:\n\n       {¶96} Respectfully, today, I move your Honor to fashion a sentence that\n\n              reflects the reality of [appellant’s] mental and psychiatric states. I\n\n              ask this of your Honor even in the face of almost certain disdain for\n\n              [appellant] because the law deems important that he was a juvenile\n\n              at the time.\n\n       {¶97} The prosecutor took no exception with the foregoing as being a\n\nfunctionally adequate recitation for purposes of sentencing appellant. And unlike Long,\n\nthe prosecutor did not argue that appellant’s youth justified a maximum sentence.\n\n       {¶98} It was against this backdrop that the trial court considered all Miller factors\n\nand afforded each one proper weight based on the particular facts of this case. That\n\nsome of the Miller factors did not favor appellant at sentencing does not mean that the\n\ntrial court failed to consider appellant’s youth as mitigating.\n\n       {¶99} Accordingly, despite the lack of an explicit statement from the trial court\n\nthat it considered this juvenile offender’s youth as mitigating, the record reflects that it\n\ndid so. The trial court simply found that, even considering the mitigating factors set forth\n\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\fin Miller, life without the possibility of parole was warranted.      That conclusion is a\n\nfunction of the facts, not a breakdown in the process.\n\n       {¶100} Thus, the trial court’s sentence complied with Miller. Further, while the\n\nOhio Supreme Court had not yet decided Long II when appellant was sentenced,\n\nbecause the Court in Long II explicitly followed Miller, by considering the Miller factors in\n\nfashioning appellant’s sentence, the trial court also complied with Long II. The trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the Miller factors is summarized as follows:\n\n       {¶101} First, the trial court considered appellant’s age and level of maturity. The\n\ncourt noted he was 17 and one-half years old at the time of his crimes. He was an\n\nintelligent student planning to graduate early and to attend college. He considered\n\nhimself to be mature for his age. He suffered no mental or cognitive impairment. He\n\nwas not insane, incompetent, or impaired at any relevant time. The court noted that,\n\nwhile there were and are no mental impairment issues, appellant feigned symptoms of\n\nmental illness when interacting with Dr. Resnick and the jail staff. The court noted that\n\nappellant knew what he did was wrong. This is why he hid his weapons in his book\n\nbag; fled from the school after the shooting; and acknowledged his wrongdoing soon\n\nafter he was apprehended.\n\n       {¶102} Second, the trial court considered appellant’s home and family\n\nenvironment. The court noted that he had a tumultuous upbringing, both as an infant\n\nand as an adolescent. His parents lost custody of him when he was three years old\n\nbecause they did not properly care for him.        However, since that time, appellant’s\n\nmaternal grandparents have provided a home for him; have raised him; and have been\n\nloving and caring guardians. The court noted that appellant sought to better himself by\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fholding various jobs and transferring to Lake Academy, which allowed him to work while\n\ngoing to school.\n\n       {¶103} Third, the trial court stated that “[m]any juvenile offenders are manipulated\n\nor pressured into committing crime by adults or peers who urge or incite the juvenile to\n\ncommit crimes. They prey upon the vulnerability of an impressionable youth. * * * That\n\ndidn’t occur here. These crimes were all Defendant’s, and [he] was not an\n\nimpressionable youth. * * * He did this on his own.” The court noted that appellant\n\nplanned, prepared for, and executed this scheme by himself. He was not manipulated or\n\npressured by anyone into committing these crimes. He confided in no one and he had\n\nno accomplice. The court explicitly stated that it considered each of the foregoing\n\nfactors in imposing sentence.\n\n       {¶104} Fourth, the court considered the circumstances of appellant’s offenses\n\nand the extent of his participation in them. The court noted that appellant planned his\n\nattack long before the shootings and methodically carried out that plan. He stole a\n\nhandgun, two magazines, and bullets from his uncle the day before the shootings. The\n\nnight before, he loaded both magazines and put one in the gun. The morning before,\n\nhe put the gun, the spare magazine, and a knife in his book bag, and hid them there\n\nuntil he took them out in the cafeteria. He intentionally dressed the part by wearing a\n\nshirt with the word “Killer” labeled across the chest. Further, appellant was relentless in\n\nhis shooting. He ambushed eight unsuspecting students who were talking with each\n\nother and did nothing to provoke him. He shot six students in the cafeteria resulting in\n\nthe death of three of them. While students and faculty were running out of the cafeteria\n\nand down the hallway, appellant aimed his gun at an adult monitor who was running\n\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\fafter him to prevent him from chasing him. While in the hallway, appellant ran up to\n\nNick Walczak, who appellant had shot in the cafeteria, and shot him again from behind.\n\nAppellant emptied the magazine in the gun of all ten of its shells. Further, the court\n\nnoted that the nature of the injuries and their impact on the victims and their families\n\nwere particularly unusual and intense. All six victims were juveniles who had lives filled\n\nwith potential. Those who were killed have been deprived of their lives. The survivors\n\nand their families have suffered devastating physical pain and psychological injury, and\n\nthey face a future that is forever tainted by appellant’s conduct. Nick is paralyzed and\n\nconfined to a wheelchair, severely challenged physically and psychologically, with a\n\nserious economic impact on his family.\n\n       {¶105} In addition, the court noted that appellant never stated his motive for this\n\nmerciless rampage. The court noted that, while being interrogated, appellant said he\n\ndid not know why he shot people. He said it was just something he chose to do. The\n\ncourt stated that, while appellant’s motive was unclear, it appeared he wanted to make\n\na name for himself and to make front page news. Thus, it was no coincidence that on\n\nthe day of the shootings, appellant boldly and brazenly wore a shirt that displayed\n\nacross his chest the word “Killer.” The court stated that because appellant attacked\n\nwithout discernible motive or provocation, appellant is “extremely dangerous.”\n\n       {¶106} Further, the court noted that appellant has shown no remorse, making him\n\nmore likely to re-offend. In his interview with the detectives, appellant said that after he\n\nfired the first few rounds, he regretted it and felt terrible. However, the court noted that\n\nhe repeatedly shot his gun at students in the cafeteria and in the hall until all rounds in\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fthe clip were fired. Further, when he was informed at the Safety Center during his\n\ninterview that one of his victims had died, he showed no remorse.\n\n      {¶107} We also note that appellant’s conduct at sentencing showed a complete\n\nlack of remorse.\n\n      {¶108} This case is distinguishable from Long II. In that case, the trial court did\n\nnot even mention at sentencing that Long was a juvenile when he committed his\n\noffenses. As a result, the Ohio Supreme Court stated it could not be sure how the trial\n\ncourt applied this factor. Id. at ¶27. Further, in Long II, the trial court had conducted a\n\ngroup sentencing of Long and his two adult accomplices at the same time. As a result,\n\nthe Supreme Court in Long II stated that Long might not have been given the benefit of\n\nthe consideration of youth as a mitigating factor. Id. at ¶28. In contrast, here, the trial\n\ncourt explicitly considered the mitigating factors of appellant’s youth on the record.\n\nFurther, in weighing appellant’s youth against other pertinent factors, including the\n\nnature of the crimes and appellant’s participation in them, the court found these factors\n\noutweighed the mitigating factors of appellant’s youth.\n\n      {¶109} In summary, the trial court was not bound by a mandatory sentencing\n\nscheme, and considered the factors outlined in Miller in imposing sentence. Moreover,\n\nby complying with Miller, the trial court also complied with Long II. Further, we cannot\n\nsay appellant’s sentence of life in prison without parole is so disproportionate to the\n\ncrimes he committed as to shock the community’s sense of justice.                Although\n\nappellant’s sentence is severe, it is not disproportionately so. He shot six students in\n\nschool, three of whom were killed and another paralyzed, without provocation and in\n\ncold blood. The horrific and senseless nature of this homicide is compounded by the\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\ffact that, at sentencing, appellant showed no remorse and even contempt for his victims\n\nand their families. In addition, appellant’s sentence was within the statutory range for\n\neach count of which he was convicted. We therefore hold that appellant’s sentence did\n\nnot amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       {¶110} Appellant’s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n       {¶111} For his third assignment of error, appellant alleges:\n\n       {¶112} “THE APPELLANT RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL\n\nCOUNSEL, IN VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO SUCH.”\n\nIneffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n\n       {¶113} Appellant argues that if this court holds the issues raised in his first two\n\nassignments of error, i.e., his mandatory bindover and his life-without-parole sentence,\n\nwere not preserved for appeal, then his trial counsel was ineffective in not doing so.\n\n       {¶114} In order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the\n\ndefendant must satisfy a two-prong test.          First, he must show that counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient. Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1984).\n\nSecond, the defendant must show the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Id.\n\nIn order to satisfy this prong, “[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel’s * * * errors, the result of the [trial] would have been\n\ndifferent.” Id. at 694. In the context of a guilty plea, the defendant must demonstrate that\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel’s errors, he would not have\n\npled guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial. State v. Curd, 11th Dist.\n\nLake No. 2003-L-030, 2004-Ohio-7222, ¶110.\n\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\f          {¶115} With respect to appellant’s argument that his attorney failed to object and\n\nthus failed to preserve his challenge to his mandatory bindover, since we hold that\n\nappellant did not waive this challenge, he was not prejudiced by his attorney’s failure to\n\nobject.\n\n          {¶116} Next, with respect to appellant’s argument that his attorney failed to\n\npreserve his constitutional challenge to his life-without-parole sentence by not\n\npresenting any constitutional argument in support of his objection, we note that in\n\naddition to trial counsel’s objection to appellant’s sentence, counsel also cited Miller,\n\nGraham, and Roper.          Further, the state concedes on appeal that appellant’s trial\n\ncounsel specifically objected to appellant’s sentence and preserved this issue for\n\nappeal. Because appellant’s trial counsel raised this issue in the trial court, the issue\n\nwas preserved and counsel’s performance was not deficient.\n\n          {¶117} We therefore hold that appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of\n\ntrial counsel.\n\n          {¶118} Appellant’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n          {¶119} For his fourth and final assigned error, appellant contends:\n\n          {¶120} “THE TRIAL COURT’S IMPOSITION OF CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES\n\nUPON THE APPELLANT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TRIAL COURT’S FINDINGS.”\n\nAppellant’s Consecutive Sentences\n\n          {¶121} Because appellant argues his consecutive sentences were not supported\n\nby the trial court’s findings, we review his sentence pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a).\n\nThat section provides that the appellate court may vacate the sentence and remand the\n\nmatter to the sentencing court for resentencing if the appellate court clearly and\n\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fconvincingly finds that the record does not support the sentencing court’s findings under\n\nR.C. 2929.14(C).\n\n      {¶122} The Eighth District recently stated in State v. Venes, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga\n\nNo. 98682, 2013-Ohio-1891:\n\n      {¶123} It is * * * important to understand that the clear and convincing\n\n      standard used by R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) is written in the negative. It does not\n\n      say that the trial judge must have clear and convincing evidence to\n\n      support its findings. Instead, it is the court of appeals that must clearly and\n\n      convincingly find that the record does not support the court’s findings. In\n\n      other words, the restriction is on the appellate court, not the trial judge.\n\n      This is an extremely deferential standard of review. Venes, supra, at ¶ 21.\n\n      {¶124} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), consecutive sentences can be imposed if\n\nthe court finds that (1) consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from\n\nfuture crime or to punish the offender and that (2) consecutive sentences are not\n\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and to the danger the\n\noffender poses to the public. In addition to these two factors, the court must find, as\n\npertinent here, that at least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one\n\nor more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the multiple\n\noffenses was so great or unusual that no one prison term for any of the offenses\n\nadequately reflects the seriousness of the offender’s conduct. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b).\n\n      {¶125} Subsequent to this amendment in the consecutive sentencing law, Ohio\n\nAppellate Districts have held that R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires trial courts to make the\n\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\fforegoing findings when imposing consecutive sentences. State v. Koeser, 11th Dist.\n\nPortage No. 2013-P-0041, 2013-Ohio-5838, ¶21.\n\n       {¶126} However, while the requirement that fact-finding occur was re-enacted by\n\nH.B. 86, the requirement that a sentencing court give reasons for imposing consecutive\n\nsentences, which existed under former R.C. 2929.19(B)(2), was not re-enacted.\n\nKoeser, supra, at ¶22. Thus, a sentencing court is not statutorily required to give\n\nreasons for its findings. Id.\n\n       {¶127} Turning now to the instant case, the trial court complied with R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4) in finding that: (1) consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the\n\npublic from future crime and to punish appellant; (2) consecutive sentences are not\n\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct and to the danger he poses to the\n\npublic; and (3) appellant committed two or more of these offenses as part of one or\n\nmore courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the offenses was so\n\ngreat or unusual that no one prison term for any of the offenses adequately reflects the\n\nseriousness of his conduct.\n\n       {¶128} Further, we note the court’s findings were supported by the record. In\n\naddition, while the court was not required to provide reasons in support of its findings,\n\nthe trial court did so and the court’s reasons were also supported by the record.\n\n       {¶129} In fact, appellant does not dispute that the trial court made the findings\n\nrequired by R.C. 2929.14(C). Nor does he deny that these findings were supported by\n\nthe record. Instead, he argues that this case is no more serious than many other\n\naggravated murder cases in which consecutive sentences are not imposed, making\n\nconsecutive sentences inappropriate here. Thus, his argument challenges only the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\fcourt’s imposition of consecutive sentences for his aggravated murder offenses, not the\n\nremaining crimes.    Further, nothing in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) suggests that a different\n\nappellate standard of review, let alone the standard suggested by appellant, applies in\n\nthe case of multiple counts of aggravated murder.\n\n       {¶130} In any event, we cannot agree with appellant’s argument that this case is\n\nnot sufficiently serious to warrant consecutive sentences.      Appellant did not act on\n\nimpulse, on provocation, or under pressure from peers or adults. To the contrary, he\n\nplanned this attack weeks in advance before he went to school that day with a loaded\n\ngun. He shot three young students to death. He shot another student several times,\n\nconfining him to a wheelchair and subjecting him to a life of pain and disability.\n\nAppellant also brought indescribable pain, grief, and lifelong tragedy to the victims’\n\nfamilies.\n\n       {¶131} Applying the appellate standard of review in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), we do\n\nnot clearly and convincingly find that the record does not support the trial court’s\n\nfindings under R.C. 2929.14(C).\n\n       {¶132} Appellant’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶133} For the reasons stated in the opinion of this court, appellant’s\n\nassignments of error lack merit and are overruled. It is the judgment and order of this\n\ncourt that the judgment of the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\n\n\nTIMOTHY P. CANNON, P.J.,\n\nTHOMAS R. WRIGHT, J.,\n\nconcur.\n\n\n\n\n                                            36\n\f</pre>",
