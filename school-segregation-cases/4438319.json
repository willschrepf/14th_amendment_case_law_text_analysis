GRIFFIN,\n                        BRIEF ON APPEAL\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUSTICES FOR THE FIRST COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Cross-Appellant, Anthony P. Griffin, hereinafter and sometimes referred to\n\nCross-Appellant Griffin, submits his initial brief, with respect to his cross-appeal in\n\nthis matter. Cross-Appellant submits as follows:\n\n       STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      Cross-Appellant brought his original petition on March 14, 2013 against\n\nAppellant, Barbara Regina Schlein (Index on Appeal at Tab 1, CR [Clerk’s\n\fRecord], at 000003-000009; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 1; see also\n\nPlaintiff’s Original Petition at id. at CR 10-21; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab\n\n2). Cross-Appellant complained that Appellant, a former client, breached her\n\ncontract of employment by failing to pay his attorneys’ fee and costs. The initial\n\npleading also asserted alternative theories of recovery, including quantum meruit,\n\nunjust enrichment, fraud, and theft of services (id.).       Appellant’s operative\n\npleading/answer, at that the time of trial, was Defendant’s Amended Answer and\n\nCounterclaim filed on June 18, 2013 (CR. 00026-00059; Cross-Appellant’s\n\nAppendix, Tab 3). Cross-Appellant filed a partial motion for summary judgment\n\non September 30, 2013 (CR. at 223-286) and his amended petition on October 4,\n\n2014 (CR 287-292); Cross-Appellant’s amended petition dropped all claims save\n\nthe breach of contract claim (id., see first amended petition at CR. at 287-292; see\n\nsecond amended petition at CR. at 628-632; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 4).\n\nThe order denying the partial motion for summary judgment was entered on\n\nDecember 27, 2013 (CR. at 420; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 5).\n\nDefendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment was filed on January 31, 2013 (CR. at\n\n472-558). The Court likewise denied Defendant’s Motion on February 28, 2014\n\n(CR. at 751; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 6).\n\n      The case was called to trial on May 8, 2014 (jury) and was tried on the\n\nfollowing days, to-wit: May 7– 9, 12-13, 19, 21-22, 27, 2014 (Reporter’s Record\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f[RR.], Master Index, Vol. 1). The jury rendered a verdict on May 22, 2014 (RR. at\n\nVol. 13; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 7 (jury charge), found at CR. at [SUPP.\n\nCLERK RECORD]; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 8 (verdict confirmation by\n\njury). Cross-Appellant filed his motion to enter a final judgment on June 12, 2014\n\n(CR at 1135-1155); he amended the amended motion on June 13, 2014 (CR. 1166-\n\n1186).   Contained in Cross-Appellant’s motion for judgment as a motion for\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict on certain unsupported portions of the\n\nverdict; the trial court denied the motion notwithstanding and entered a final\n\njudgment on June 30, 2014 (CR. at 1208; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 9; CR.\n\nat 1249-1250; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 10).\n\n      Appellant Schlein filed a motion for new trial on July 30, 2014 (CR. at\n\n1209-1224). The trial court denied the motion for new trial on September 11, 2014\n\n(CR. at 1245; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 11). Appellant filed her notice of\n\nappeal on September 26, 2014 (CR. at 1238-1241; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix,\n\nTab 12). Cross-Appellant filed his notice of cross-appeal on October 10, 2014\n\n(CR. 1242-1244; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 13).\n\n      This case is properly before this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                      STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      This Court’s jurisdiction vests under Rule 25.1, Texas Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure (commenced by filing a notice of appeal from district court judgment).\n\n                          __________________________\n\n                              STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      During opening statement, counsel for Cross-Appellant Griffin framed the\n\nmatter as a simple breach of contract claims, asserting Appellant Schlein failed to\n\npay attorney’s fees and costs due and owing to Cross-Appellant (RR. at Vol. 4 at\n\n74, lines 19-25; 75, lines 1-19). “I think the evidence will show that she hasn’t\n\npaid him a red cent.” Cross-Appellant’s counsel explanation in opening framed the\n\nunderlying factual history:\n\n      I don’t know of anything that she wanted that he failed to do, but we’ll wait\n\n      and see what happens with that. I don’t think that you’re going to find that\n\n      Mr. Griffin did anything wrong in this case, except get on his horse and act\n\n      as a knight for her, who he thought was an abused woman, who was also not\n\n      getting a fair shake in court and that he took it without getting a fair shake in\n\n      court and that he took it without getting any money up front because they\n\n      couldn’t and he trusted her all the way through and that to this day he has\n\n      not been paid a red cent; and yet, when he sues for collection, they now\n\n      claim that he has malpracticed her in some way. She says that was by him\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       telling her to show up in court for him once. He denies that. I have no idea\n\n       what that’s about and that she wasn’t kept informed.\n\nId. at 82, lines 9-23.\n\n       Appellant Schlein and Cross-Appellant Griffin entered a legal services\n\ncontract on November 3, 2009 (RR., Vol. 14, pp. 5-14; labeled as Plaintiff’s\n\nExhibit 1 (Contractual Agreement) and Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2 (cover letter to\n\ncontract); Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Attachment 14). The contract explicitly\n\nset out the following language:            representation in “all matters concerning the\n\ndivorce/family related matter/civil issues (tort issues) in a matter styled In the\n\nMatter of the Marriage of Barbara Regina Schlein and Robert Schlein; in the\n\nCounty Court at Law, No. 2; Galveston County, Texas; Cause No. 08FD2371\n\n(supra, Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1).\n\n       The contract required the payment of a retainer of $35,000.00, but also\n\ncontained a footnote stating, “[c]urrently Petitioner is under an order of the Court\n\nthat prevents the expenditure of funds without the approval of the Court. No\n\npayment of fees will take place unless and until the Court approves the payment of\n\nthe retainer amount and/or an order is entered releasing the injunction overbroad\n\nscope (can be interpreted to include separate property of Petitioner).”1\n\n\n\n1\n    At the time of the resolution of the divorce the temporary injunction entered by the trial court\n    had ceased being in effect (RR., Vol. 8 at 90, lines 4-25; 9, lines 1-5).\n\n                                                 5\n\f      The contract also provided the retainer fee should not be interpreted as\n\nconstituting the full reasonable fee to which the Lawyers may be entitled for\n\nservices performed pursuant to an award of the Court or settlement (id. at\n\nunnumbered page 3). The work of Cross-Appellant was billed at $300.00 an hour\n\n(id. at unnumbered page 4). Cross-Appellant’s lawsuit made clear that neither the\n\nretainer nor any additional fees and costs had been paid.\n\n      Appellant was called as the first witness during the trial; when questioned\n\nwhether she had paid “a red cent to Anthony Griffin for his services,” she\n\nresponded, “[t]hat is not true.” When asked what money has been paid, Appellant\n\nexplained, “I have paid him in product, which is the same as money” (RR., Vol. 4\n\nat 101, lines 7-12). Appellant went on to explain it was her belief has overpaid\n\n“[h]e owes me money” (id. at 101, lines 14-21). When the witness was brought to\n\nthe question of “money”, the witness then asked for a definition of money.\n\nAppellant then affirmed she stated she has not “paid him cash dollar money. I’ve\n\npaid him in product (id. at 102, lines 1-4).\n\n      The contract of employment between Appellant and Cross-Appellant was\n\nadmitted as Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1 (id. at 104, lines 1-7; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix,\n\nTab 14). Appellant testified the contract was executed in person (id. at 105, lines\n\n13-25), contained a section relating to the payment of a retainer on hiring A Griffin\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fLawyers/Anthony P. Griffin, Inc. (id. at 107, lines 5-25; 108, lines 1-2).2\n\nAppellant testified the contract did not apply to her, although her signature\n\nappeared on same. Appellant testified the contract was amended orally (id. at 110,\n\nlines 18-25; 111, lines 1-6), “it was explained to me differently and that’s why we\n\nhave a letter of explanation of contract and letter agreement [;] otherwise, there\n\nwould be no purpose for this to have been drawn up” (id.). Appellant stated she\n\nwas given a flat fee of $35,000.00, even though the contract never used the words\n\nflat fee. Appellant against restated her position – she had paid by the tender of\n\nproduct, “Peruvian tile” (id. at 112, lines 3-10).\n\n       And I’ll tell you what: $35,000 is a lot more [sic] than $110,000; and I’m a\n\n       single parent; and trust me, I just didn’t have that kind of money. 3 I wasn’t\n\n\n2\n    Appellant explained Anthony P. Griffin, Inc. was a defunct corporation, and that A Griffin\n    Lawyers was an assumed named used by Anthony P. Griffin, with Anthony P. Griffin being\n    entitled to collect the debts for either entity (RR., Vol. 8 at 86, lines 4-25; 87, lines 1-25; 88,\n    lines 1-15).\n3\n    Appellant was referred to Appellee by a Marie Trefethern (RR., Vol. 6 at 155, line 21-25).\n    At the time, Trefethern was employed on a part-time basis with the Galveston County\n    District Attorney’s Office doing protective orders (id. at 156, lines 1-14) and travelled to\n    Appellee’s office with Appellant. Trefethern participated in the first meeting.\n\n    Appellant had previously been represented by four other lawyers, all family law practitioners\n    (id. at 157, lines 7-25; 158, lines 1-9). Trefethern travelled to Appellee’s office with\n    Appellant (id). Appellant paid her first lawyer, Greg Enos, $21,000.00, for 30 days of work;\n    her second lawyer, Rebecca Reitz, $90,000.00 - $100,000.00, for three to four months; her\n    third lawyer, Marcia Zimmerman, $40,000.00 - $50,000.00, for three months of work; her\n    fourth lawyer, Christopher Beck, some $23,000.00 for four months of work. Beck’s payment\n    took place even though the trial court (Judge C.G. Dibrell) had ordered Appellant not to\n    expend any more money on attorneys’ fees (id. at 158-161, lines 1-25; 162, lines 1-11).\n    Appellant feigned memory problems with regards to what she expended on previous lawyers\n\n                                                  7\n\f   prepared for that. If he would have billed me or even told me, “Hey, look,\n\n   you know, I’m going to need some more money,” or verbally or billed be,\n\n   which he said he would do according to his own contract, I would have\n\n   known. I would’ve been prepared. The reason for me showing up at his\n\n   office was to write him a check for $35,000. We’re done. That’s it.\n\n\n\n\nbut ultimately concede a figure ranging from $179,000.00 - $250,000.00 (RR, Vol. 5 at 57,\nlines 11-25; 58-65, lines 1-25; 66, lines 1-17). Trefethern brought Appellant to Appellee’s\noffice because the problems she was having in Judge Dibrell’s court and the belief the Judge,\nher spouse’s lawyer were personal friends - she felt she was not getting a fair shake (supra,\nRR, Vol. 6 at 157, lines 7-25). Appellant also expressed dissatisfaction with her current\nlawyers (Beck), contemplated filing suit against former counsel Reitz over her fee, and made\nit clear she had already hired an expert willing to testify against Reitz (Lillian Hardwick)\n(RR., Vol. 7 at 18, lines 8-23). Appellee represented Appellant for some 700 days (RR., Vol.\n7 at 10, lines 1-25).\n\nThe jury also heard the amount of fees Appellant had incurred and paid to her current trial\ncounsel, Christian, Smith & Jewell, LLP (RR., Vol. 11, at 72). Gary Jewell, an\nadministrative partner with the firm (id. at 74, lines 14-25), explained Appellant has incurred\nand paid $50,638.50 on matters outside of the divorce (id. at 83, lines 4-10 (identified these\nfees as matters started by Anthony Griffin in which his firm finalized). (id.) and $369,892.89\nfor work related to the dispute herein, Griffin v. Schlein, plus $27,541.06 in expenses (id. at\n84, lines 6-25; 85, lines 1-15). Albeit, Appellant’s counsel discounted their bill in front of\nthe jury to $260,000.00, the jury heard the sum did not include the fees being incurred during\nthe trial itself (id. at 87, lines 1-25; 88 lines 1-8). This amount did not include the $27,541.06\nsought in expenses (id.). This sum did not include any fees paid to local counsel, Stephen\nLewis, for his work and appearance at trial (id. at 119, lines 20-25; 120, lines 1-25; 125, lines\n18-25; 126-129, lines 1-25; 151, lines 14-25; 152, lines 1-25; 153-154, lines 1-25; 155, lines\n21-25; 156, lines 1-5).\n\nThus the fees paid to counsel, prior to Griffin’s hire, was between $174,000-194,000.00. The\namount paid to trial counsel, after Griffin terminated the relationship because of non-\npayment was minimally $370,000.00, not including $276,541.06 paid in expenses and an\nadditional sum unknown paid to local counsel. The jury ultimately rejected Appellant’s\nclaim for fees against Griffin and awarded Griffin his entire fees and costs incurred,\ndiscussed infra.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fRR., Vol. 4 at 113, lines 16-25.\n\n       Appellant accused Cross-Appellant of backdating his bill – the contract was\n\ndated August 5, 2011 (id. at 114, lines 11-20). Appellant contended she did not\n\nreceive the contract until four days after the divorce was final, which was October\n\n28th (id.).4 Appellant said when travelled to Cross-Appellant’s office to write the\n\ncheck for $35,000.00, she experienced a “bait and switch” by Cross-Appellant (id.\n\nat 115, lines 1-4). When asked what a bait and switch was, Appellant explained,\n\n“Well, you know, when you’re expecting to pay $35,000 - - which I don’t know\n\nabout you guys, but that’s a lot of money – that’s a ton of money for me being a\n\nsingle parent especially. [$] 111,000 was astronomically mind blowing. I just – I\n\nwas just shocked. I threw up. I had to go in his bathroom and throw up.” Id. at\n\n115, lines 5-11). Appellant then told the jury, “If the retainer exceeded $35,000, he\n\nwould have been billing me during the divorce process; and he didn’t do one single\n\nbill. So, how would I know” (id. at 116, lines 19-25; 117, line 1).5\n\n         Appellant admitted being required to paid $70,000.00, as interim attorney’s\n\nfee, to her husband’s lawyer (id. at 117, lines 2-23), in addition to $40,000.00 as\n\ntemporary support for her spouse (id.). The jury also heard these payments were\n\n\n4\n    Four days after October 28, 2011, for purposes this record, would be November 1st. Appellee\n    denied the assertion of backdating the bill, he testified the bill was mailed August 5, 2011\n    and was not backdated (RR., Vol. 7 at 24, lines 15-25; 25, lines 1-21).\n5\n    No language in the contract between the parties required monthly billing.\n\n                                               9\n\fbecause Appellant was accused in the underlying divorce of hiding and wasting\n\ncommunity assets (RR., Vol. 6 at 161, lines 9-25; 162, lines 1-11 (spending money\n\non lawyers after injunction by the trial court); 168, lines 1-25; 169, lines 1-4\n\n(attempt by spouse to appoint receiver to protect assets of the community estate,\n\nincluding separate funds in attempt); RR., Vol. 7 at 28, lines 17-25; 29-32, lines 1-\n\n25; 33, lines 1-7; 35, lines 14-25; 36, lines 1-11 (preparation for trial revelation\n\ndeletion from records, hiding funds, refusal to answer; issue of avoiding suborning\n\nperjury prior to trial).   The following additional exchange in reflective of the\n\ntestimony at trial:\n\n      [NORMA VENSO]\n\n      Q. Okay. I’m not asking you about that yet. While the case was pending\n\n           when Judge Dibrell ordered that you pay the interim attorney’s fees of\n\n           Mr. Schlein, did you ask your lawyer to take any action about that?\n\n      …\n\n      [BARBARA SCHLEIN]\n\n      A. Okay. I’m sorry, what is your question again?\n\n      Q. The question is: After Judge Dibrell had ordered you to pay your\n\n          husband’s lawyer while the case was still pending, did you ask Mr.\n\n          Griffin what could be done about that?\n\n      A. I don’t recall that conversation; and I don’t recall, you know, the divorce,\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f   like you said, lasted a few years. I don’t recall the time frame, dollar\n\n   amounts. That would be impossible. Remember, my divorce started in\n\n   2008. We’re almost in 2015. That as so many years ago, I don’t know.\n\nQ. Okay. Did you object to Anthony Griffin filing a mandamus in the Court\n\n   of Appeals appealing that ruling that you - - appealing it during the time\n\n   that the divorce was pending an extraordinary remedy, did you object to\n\n   him trying to get you a remedy for that in the Court of Appeals?\n\nA. I don’t recall. There was so much paperwork going on, I just don’t\n\n   remember.\n\nQ. So you don’t remember any mandamus being filed by Mr. Griffin and\n\n    whether – it’s just out of your mind?\n\nA. Part of it is I’m not an attorney and I don’t know all your legal jargon.\n\n   And if you said was there paperwork filed, I’d say, “Yeah, there was lots\n\n   of paperwork filed.” But what the paperwork that was filed was called,\n\n   I’m not a legal expert; and I’m not going to pretend to be; and I just\n\n   don’t know. I don’t know what he filed. He never had communication\n\n   with me so bottom line is: I could never get ahold of the man.\n\n             I never knew was going on. His status was horrible. No billing\n\n   statements ever, not one during the divorce. I might have had an inkling\n\n   of what was going on if I read it, so the answer is no.”\n\n\n                                   11\n\fId. at 119, lines 10-25; 120, lines 1-25; 121, lines 1-3.\n\n      Coupled with Appellant not remembering paperwork related to any\n\nmandamus, or any pleadings filed with the courts on her behalf (id. at 121, lines\n\n13-25; 122, lines 1-7), she summarily again informed the jury, “He never kept me\n\ninformed” (id. at 122, lines 7-23). Appellant testified Cross-Appellant kept her\n\nclient files, did not return the same (id. at 123, lines 1-5). The Court sustained\n\nCross-Appellant counsel’s objection. “I don’t recall getting much from him, if\n\nanything. I could get ahold of him on the phone let alone get anything from him” –\n\nwas the consistent tenor of Appellant’s testimony (id. at 123, lines 12-14).\n\n      When asked specifically how Cross-Appellant malpracticed her; Appellant\n\nset out a number of allegations:\n          \n              He fired me and he would not “give me client file back and I\n\n              absolutely was beside myself. Here I am fired. Now he wants – he’s\n\n              got a new billing statement for me. I have no attorneys. I have no\n\n              client file and my house is ready for foreclose on January 2 nd and\n\n              we’re hitting the holidays.”6\n\n\n   Id. at 132, lines 15-25; 133, lines 1-2 5; 134, lines 1-2 (further testimony that Appellee’s\n   failure to tender her file was the cause of the loss of the house in foreclosure). With regards\n   to the allegation of failure to return the client’s file, contrary testimony was also heard by the\n   jury, including the testimony of Rita Westerman, Linda Griffin, and Appellee.\n\n   Rita Westerman testified she was employed with Appellee for twenty-three years at the time\n   of the trial and remembered Appellant as a client of the office (RR., Vol. 6 at 139, lines 4-25;\n   140, lines 1-4). Westerman explained she was present in the office when Appellant came to\n\n                                                12\n\f           \n               That Cross-Appellant should have filed an insurance claim on her\n\n               house under construction at 1628 Enterprise (also same house which\n\n               was foreclosed on by the County. There was testimony the house was\n\n               hit by Hurricane Ike and uninsured at the time of the strike).7 When\n\n               asked whether she was blaming Cross-Appellant for the foreclosure,\n\n               Appellant ultimately explained, “I’m not placing blame, but I’m\n\n\n    retrieve her client files (id. at 143, lines 1-25; 144, lines 1-25 (“there could have been 30 or\n    40 boxes of files we had to give her back”).\n\n    Linda Griffin identified herself as a relative of Appellee (sister). Griffin testified she worked\n    part-time for Appellee and possessed a law degree, and prior to becoming a lawyer she\n    worked as a court reporter in federal court (id. at 123, lines 1-25). She also testified she\n    witnessed Schlein retrieve her files from the office (id. at 129, lines 8-25130, lines 1-16).\n\n    Appellee Griffin testified the file was returned after preparing the file for pickup (RR., Vol. 7\n    at 40, lines 10-25; 41, lines 1-25; 42, lines 1-21).\n7\n    Appellant argued that Appellee should have filed an insurance claim and identified the\n    insurance in effect at the time as Builder’s Risk Insurance (RR., Vol. 5 at 27, lines 11-25).\n    Appellant then postured she had “no idea if there was flood or wind. I wasn’t’ the builder so,\n    you know, he paid for the policy so how would I know that? I don’t know. That’s what I’m\n    saying. I don’t know what policies he had in effect at the time and that’s why Anthony got\n    this letter to find out, to subpoena them.” Id. at 41, lines 4-13. Appellant then admitted he\n    informed Appellant there builder failed to have wind and flood insurance during the\n    hurricane, “Most likely told him, but did I know? No. It’s, like I said, I most likely. I don’t\n    know. I wasn’t the builder.” Id. at 42, lines 6-10. Appellant also confirmed her previously\n    informing Appellant that the wind and flood insurance expired May 26, 2007 (prior to Ike’s\n    landing of September 2008) (id. at 43, lines 6-25; 44, lines 1-21; 45, lines 1-22).\n\n    Appellee explained that a lawsuit was brought against the builder for not having insurance,\n    per the client’s request. There was no wind and flood insurance at the time the Hurricane hit\n    and the Enterprise home suffered substantial damages (RR., Vol. 7 at 11, lines 9-25).\n    Appellee testified he initially learned there was no insurance from Appellant; he was\n    ultimately tendered documents affirming as much. Id. Appellee said notion of filing a claim\n    when no insurance was in existence did not make sense (id. at 12, lines 18-25; 13, lines 1-25;\n    14, line 1).\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                saying he contributed to issues at hand and he knows what those\n\n                issues are” (RR., Vol. 5 at 97, lines 16-25; 98, lines 1-25; 99, lines 1-\n\n                22).8 Appellant testified Cross-Appellant should be responsible to her\n\n                for the sum of $700,000.009 on this claim because “I felt like he\n\n                should have made a claim.” When counsel inquired whether this\n\n                meant the Builder’s Risk Insurance, Appellant answered in context of\n\n                a possible wish, “[o]n whatever insurance policies that he was going\n\n                to go get from the custodian of records at the insurance company” (id.\n\n                at 52, lines 11-25; 53, lines 1-11).10\n\n\n8\n     Later in her testimony, Appellant changed her testimony and contended Cross-Appellant\n     advised her not to pay the taxes on the house, “therefore, due to my lawyer’s advice, it did\n     foreclose” (RR., Vol. 6 at 13, lines 16-25; 14, lines 1-5). Appellant retreated from this\n     position when her documents revealed she requested Cross-Appellant to negotiate a payment\n     plan on the taxes, which Cross-Appellant accomplished (id. at 14, lines 18-25; 15, lines 1-25;\n     16, lines 1-25; 17, lines 1-24).\n9\n     When asked to quantify this sum, Appellant explained the sum would be the difference of\n     what she got at the foreclosure sale (received $760,000.00) of the property and the sum\n     $1,550,000. Appellant stood by the $1,550,000.00 even though her own appraiser valued the\n     property, at most, at $724,000.00 – all because of the uninsured storm damage (RR., Vol., 5\n     at 94, lines 9-25; 95, lines 1-25; 96, lines 1-18).\n\n     Appellant then tied herself in a proverbial knot, explaining, “if the builder negligence claim\n     had been made, which would make it $1,550,000.00 and you take the difference between that\n     number and the $760,000, that is a number that you should have been received for that house,\n     not the $760,000 dollar loss” (id. at 96, lines 13-25). Appellant admitted a builder’s\n     negligence lawsuit was filed, but said she didn’t consent to the filing of the claim (id. at 96,\n     lines 19-23), that he wants to hold Cross-Appellant Griffin liable for the builder’s negligence\n     (id. at 96, lines 24-25; 97, line 3), even though she testified she objected to him filing the\n     builder’s negligence lawsuit (id. at 97, lines 2-4).\n10\n     In trying to obtain a handle on the malpractice claim, Cross-Appellant’s counsel had the\n     following exchange with Appellant. The discussion related to a letter/email drafted by\n\n                                                 14\n\f            \n                That Cross-Appellant failed to keep her informed and undertook\n\n                actions willy-nilly. The notion Appellant was not kept informed took\n\n                the form of denying receiving any of the multitude of letters, emails,\n\n                etcetera, keeping her informed (RR., Vol. 5 at 115, lines 4-25; 116-\n\n\n\n   Appellant to Cross-Appellant.\n\n       [NORMA VENSO]\n\n       Q.

Ma’am, can I get a copy of that?\n       Q.       Does No. 2 start with, “Who’s in control of this court, Bill or Judge Roberts?”\n       A.       Yes.\n       Q.       “Just read Bill’s letter,” which you obviously had; is that correct?\n       A.       Yes.\n       Q.        “His language to you is highly condescending and controlling and offensive. Bill\n                makes you look bad to this judge ever[y] chance he gets. You should be offended\n                that Mr. De La Garza treats you with such disrespect and unprofessionalism. I’m\n                appalled and offended that he does this to you because you [,] Anthony are the\n                good guys in this horrible situation that Bill De La Garza has created and\n                continues to create,” but you’ve changed your mind about who the good guy is in\n                this case and now you’re asking that Anthony Griffin pay the $700,000 that you\n                say you lost on your house at Enterprise? Are you asking for $700,000 from Mr.\n                Griffin because you think he’s malpracticed you?\n       A.       Yes.\n       Q.       Do you want to explain that again, how he’s malpracticed you? You were\n                looking confused.\n       A.       Well, I was just trying to make the correlation.\n       …\n       Q.       (By Ms. Venso) When did you change your mind about Anthony Griffin\n                being the good guy.\n       A.       I never changed my mind. Anthony Griffin fired me.\n\nRR, Vol. 5 at 89, lines 15-25; 90, lines 1-24; emphasis added.\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f                118, lines 1-25; 119, lines 1-12; 120, lines 7-25; 121-126, lines 1-25;\n\n                127, lines 1-4).11\n\n\n11\n     During Cross-Appellant’s testimony, Plaintiff’s Exhibits 85 through 117 were admitted into\n     evidence. All such exhibits were identified by Cross-Appellant as letters, emails and\n     documents directed to Appellant keeping her informed with regards to her case (RR., Vol. 8\n     at 14, lines 10-25; 15-31, lines 1-25; 32, lines 1-21). In addition, Plaintiff’s Exhibits 118-136\n     were admitted reflecting the same type of information (id. at 32, lines 22-25; 33-42, lines 1-\n     25; 43, lines 1-9).\n\n     Cross-Appellant testified the Appellant was not dissatisfied with his services and that the\n     dispute arose when he refused her offer of her tile and a reduction of his fees and costs. Prior\n     to coming into his office in October, Appellant had drafted a document apologizing for\n     Cross-Appellant not being paid. The document reads in part:\n\n                “I’m sorry you haven’t been paid. I thank God every day that you and your staff\n                have stayed with Austin and I. You are obviously passionate about your job.\n                Now I know why people say really good things about you that they do. I wish\n                everyone could read this e-mail and see things how they really are in this case.\n                The Court is bankrupting us, even though I have separate property money to live\n                on.”\n\n     Id. at 46, lines 2-125; 47, lines 1-18; see email at RR., Vol. 15, Plaintiff’s Exhibit 83.\n\n     Cross-Appellant testified Appellant prevailed in the divorce. The community assets were\n     split 50/50%, with Appellant received the community home (her request to the Court), with a\n     reimbursement order to her spouse of $371,000 (approximately $150,000 less than his share\n     contributed to house) (RR., Vol. 7 at 34, lines 12-22). Albeit the jury found against Appellant\n     her cruelty, adultery and abuse claims (id. at 34, lines 20-25; 35, lines 1-10), the 50/50% split\n     and awarding of home to Appellant still took place. In addition, Appellant was able to avoid\n     the payment of attorneys fee to the opposing lawyer ($450,000 claim), reimbursement to her\n     former spouse, contribution to the community estate ($400,000 claim), and avoiding the\n     claim of her having possession of his separate property ($300,000 claim) (RR., Vol. 6, 171,\n     24-25; 172, lines 1-10). Appellant also received her separate property funds ($600,000 -\n     $800,000.00) (id. at 172, lines 15-25). Appellant expressed happiness with the trial, but\n     disappointment with her not receiving funds on the civil tort portions of the verdict in the\n     divorce. Appellant was also happy she received the Enterprise home, in that it is something\n     she requested of the trial court (id. at 173, lines 1-25; 174, lines 1-25; 175, lines 1-25).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\f      Appellant   also   contended    Cross-Appellant    breached    his   fiduciary\n\nresponsibility to her by revealing things she told him in confidence (RR., Vol. 6 at\n\n6, lines 9-13). This claim related to Appellant’s contention that Cross-Appellant\n\nplaced in his original pleadings filed with the Court matters she contends should\n\nhave been confidential conversations – even though in the same breath she\n\ncontends the confidential conversation never took place (id. at 6, lines 14-25; 7,\n\nlines 1-25). Appellant also contended Cross-Appellant defamed her by placing\n\ninformation in the lawsuit claiming she had taken and hidden evidence from the\n\nother side in the divorce proceeding - Appellant contended this too as an event\n\nnever occurred. Id.\n\n      Appellant admitted Cross-Appellant never tried to bill her for any of the\n\nother work he performed for her (RR., Vol. 6, at 30, lines 13-20). And with\n\nregards to the allegation by Appellant she paid Cross-Appellant in property,\n\nAppellant contended the tile was worth $57,000 and “he had kept it and he’s only\n\ndue and owing $35,000. So the difference is almost $22,000 that he owes me” (id.\n\nat 33, lines 10-17). Appellant admitted she paid $20,301.88 for the tile (id. at 36,\n\nlines 1-18).\n\n      The jury heard testimony that the valuation of the tile also ultimately was\n\nproblematic.   The tile’s value was tendered by a Paulette Varner.           Varner\n\nidentified herself as an interior designer by profession.     Varner testified she\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\fattended South Dakota State University in interior design and ultimately finished\n\nher degree in interior design at North Dakota State University [sic] (RR., Vol. 11 at\n\n42, lines 8-25; 43, lines 1-5). Varner is the owner of Vstudios, located in the\n\nWoodlands area (id. at 43, lines 19-21). She described the tile as venato, from\n\nPeru (id. at 46, lines 7-25; 47, lines 1-19). Varner appraised the tile at $56,338.85\n\n(id. at 52, lines 11-13; see report at Defendant’s Exhibit 7); testifying the tile has\n\nappreciated in value (id. at 55, lines 14-25; 56, lines 1-19), because of its rare\n\nnature (id.). When asked about a sample tile labeled Defendant’s Exhibit 82,\n\nVarner testified she didn’t know where the tile came from, only it was given to her\n\nby Schlein and her lawyers (id. at 59, lines 13-25). It was her assumption the tile\n\nwas taken from the Schlein home prior to the tile going to the warehouse (id. at 60,\n\nlines 1-6). When presented with Plaintiff’s Exhibit 150, a tile from the warehouse,\n\nVarner stated the tile was not vernato (id. at 60, lines 7-25). The jury also heard,\n\nthe other products/items ordered for the Enterprise home ended up being\n\nfraudulent/fake (concrete pilings or columns instead of the travertine columns\n\nbeing delivered) (id. at 62, lines 8-25; 63, lines 1-19).\n\n      Varner’s resume reflected she possessed a master’s of architecture from the\n\nUniversity of Texas; she said he as a student in 1981, 1982 (id. at 58, lines 9-11). .\n\nShe testified it took her a year and a half to complete the degree (id. at 57, lines 2-\n\n18) and that the degree was obtained in her maiden name, Ellington. Id. Varner\n\n\n                                           18\n\fstated she is not a license architect, “I passed every section except for structures the\n\nfirst time, and the structures portion I took five times and just didn’t pass it” (id. at\n\n58, lines 1-8). After Varner’s credential were checked, it was determined she\n\nnever attended the University of Texas (see Plaintiff’s Exhibit 153; RR., Vol. 12 at\n\n117, lines 18-25; 118, lines 1-25; 119, lines 1-22). The witness’ bold face\n\nmisstatement of her qualifications is something the jury was free to consider.\n\n        To support her claims against Cross-Appellant, Appellant called Lillian\n\nHardwick.       Hardwick testified she has co-authored a treatise on attorney judicial\n\nethics in 2002 (RR., Vol. 10 at 120, lines 6-25; 121, 1-4). Hardwick explained she\n\nis also involved presenting at continuing legal education courses, participation in\n\nState Bar Committees (id. at 121, lines 1-25) and advising lawyers or law firms on\n\nthe disciplinary rules (id. at 122, lines 2-12).\n\n        Hardwick stated she was hired by Appellant to figure out which of the\n\nattorney’s fiduciary duties might have been violated by Cross-Appellant (id. at\n\n122, lines 13-20). Hardwick expressed a view Cross-Appellant violated his duty of\n\nloyalty,12 candor, and confidentiality13 (id. at 123, lines 9-21). In this context,\n\n\n12\n     With regards to the duty of loyalty, the witness explained as follows:\n\n        My opinion is that he breached the duty of loyalty in that this agreement, whether taken\n        individually or together, is unconscionable in that it is overreaching and not clear; and\n        that is at the outset of the relationship, the lawyer, of course, knows much more about\n        what’s going on and what will be going on than the client does. So it’s the lawyer’s\n        obligation to set out what’s going to happen and particularly how the lawyer is going to\n        be paid in a way that is clear to the client” (id. at 126, lines 1-16).\n\n                                                19\n\fHardwick express a view the sending of only one invoice constituted a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty (id. at 132, lines 5-25), a view that nothing in the contract allowed\n\nfor Cross-Appellant to bill for copy cost (id. at 133, lines 7-23; 134, line 1 (breach\n\nof fiduciary duty to not disclose and then charge for it) ). Hardwick also criticized\n\nCross-Appellant saying he breached the duty of confidentiality (id. at 137, lines 7-\n\n25). This opinion related to the Appellant’s contention her file was not turned over\n\nto her and the retention of the tile (id. at 137, lines 8-25; 138, lines 1-23). At no\n\npoint did Appellant submit a question to the jury as to who owned the tile.\n\n        On cross examination, Hardwick affirmed she had previously been hired by\n\nSchlein in the Reitz representation of Schlein (id. at 141, lines 7-25). Hardwick\n\ntestified she never talked to Schlein, only to her lawyers and documents provided\n\n\n\n     Hardwick explained her problem with the agreement related to the language identifying\n     stating “all matters concerning this divorce,” whether they were civil issues, tort issues,\n     whatever (id. at 127, lines 2-17). Hardwick expressed the opinion that “it gives the lawyer an\n     opportunity later on to do exactly what I said, to interpret it to his or her advantage down the\n     road (id. at 127, lines 21-25).\n\n     Cross-Appellant testified his bill was segregated and the only matter billed was the divorce\n     matter and all other matters performed by Cross-Appellant were not billed (RR., Vol. 8 at 61,\n     lines 22-25; 62-64, lines 1-25). Even in this context, Appellant’s counsel incorrectly held out\n     to the expert, “Mr. Griffin has testified that there is no limit as to what his fees might be that\n     Ms. Schlein has to pay under this agreement” (id. at 129, lines 18-25; 130, 1-4). The expert\n     then responded “Yes, because by no means do I think this agreement communicates that. So\n     if that’s what he intended to communicate, then he has breached the duty of communication,\n     as well as created an overreaching or unconscionable agreement that does not clearly convey\n     that at the outset.” Id.\n13\n     This was explained as “Mr. Griffin revealed in a pleading, which is public things that Ms.\n     Schlein told him in attorney-client communications; and they are set out there now for all the\n     world to see” (id. at 159, lines 10-15).\n\n                                                  20\n\fby the lawyers (id. 142, lines 1-25). “We talked about what I would testify which\n\nis breach of fiduciary duty” (id. at 142, lines 19-24). Hardwick admitted never\n\nsitting first chair at trial, never handling a divorce, and never having done free\n\nlegal work for someone under order not to spend any more money on attorney’s\n\nfee (id. at 143, lines 20-25; 144, lines 1-4).        The witness admitted she was\n\nexpressing an opinion with regards to Cross-Appellant’s standard of care in a\n\npractice-specific area of divorce, “I am not a divorce lawyer; and I’m not here to\n\ntestify about the standard of care or to give it for you” (id. at 146, lines 2-13).\n\n      When asked about the home not having insurance, Hardwick stated she\n\nrecalled the discussion, “I’m not sure that I know the difference between them” (id.\n\nat 147, lines 12-25; 148, lines 1-6). When asked whether Cross-Appellant violated\n\nhis duty by failing to file a builder’s risk claim on behalf of Ms. Schlein, the\n\nwitness backed away again, “Whatever he did or did not do, I’m saying it was his\n\nduty to explain to her what he was doing and why he was doing it or why he was\n\nnot doing it” (id. at 148, lines 9-21). The expert however is clear in imposing on\n\nCross-Appellant a standard of requiring him to pursue the charges and objectives\n\nor Appellant, or an explanation of why not (id. at 149, lines 10-25; 150, lines 1-2).\n\n      [NORMA VENSO]\n\n      Q.     But if she did get an explanation, then there was no breach of\n\n              fiduciary duty?\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\f       [LILLIAN HARDWICK]\n\n       A.     Assuming the explanation classified that for her, yes; and it’s for the\n\n              jury to decide whether that explanation was sufficient.\n\nId. at 150, lines 3-7.\n\n       Hardwick expressed no opinion whether the house being foreclosed was\n\nCross-Appellant fault (id. at 151, lines 8-11). She expressed no opinion on the\n\nemail from Schlein expressing satisfaction with Griffin’s work and Schlein regrets\n\nGriffin had not been paid (id. at 154, lines 1-6), nor the work performed by Griffin\n\nwith regards to her taxes and working out an arrangement (id. at 154, lines 7-13).\n\nHardwick also expressed no opinion whether there was wind or flood insurance\n\n(id. at 155, lines 1-4).\n\n       [NORMA VENSO]\n\n       Q. So you’re not here saying there was a viable insurance claim. You’re\n\n            just saying that if what the other side tells you is true, that Mr. Griffin\n\n            didn’t explain to her enough of why an insurance claim wasn’t file?\n\n       [LILLIAN HARDWICK]\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. And you’re calling that a breach of fiduciary duty?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. The failure to explain.\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f        A. Yes, it’s the breach of duty of loyalty and of communication.\n\n        Q. Would you agree with me that in a legal malpractice claim, it is the\n\n            burden to prove that there would have been a different result but for the\n\n            negligence of the lawyer?\n\n        A. It depends on how you define legal malpractice. I think you’re talking\n\n            about negligence cases.\n\n\n        Q. Yes, I am.\n\n        A. I’m here testifying about breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nId. at 156, lines 4-25.\n\n        There was a series of witnesses who were called by Cross-Appellant after\n\nhis character was moved into evidence, over objection.14 Those witnesses included\n\n\n\n\n14\n        During Cross-Appellant’s testimony, the Court allowed Appellant to inquire of Cros-\n     Appellant sanctions by State Bar of Texas, regarding client complaints. With respect to a\n     client named Guzman (RR., Vol. 10, at 55, lines 15-25; 56, lines 1-25; 57, lines 1-25\n     (testimony entered in agreement with State Bar on sanction, probated suspension). Likewise\n     in matter involving a client named Cusick, Cross-Appellant agreed to a public reprimand,\n     voluntarily sent a letter of apology to Mr. Cusick (id. at 59, lines 7-25; 60, lines 1-25; 61,\n     lines 10-24). And finally, in regards to a client named Vereen, a judgment of public\n     reprimand for neglecting the client’s matter (id. at 61, lines 23-25; 62, lines 1-25; 63, lines 1-\n     25). Cross-Appellant explained his office was affected by Hurricane Ike, receiving 4 to 5\n     feet of water, destroying one-half of open and pending files (lost or destroy) (id. at 68, lines\n     13-25; 69, lines 1-15). With regards to large litigation files., stored in a warehouse, the\n     warehouse received eight (8) feet of water, with the destruction of one-half of those files\n     destroyed (id.).\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fMichael Landolt,15 Helen Truscott,16 Mary Luna,17 Joanna Mora,18 and Lloyd\n\nGilliam.19\n\n\n\n\n15\n      Landolt explained he is a current client of Cross-Appellant. Landolt is a wealth financial\n     manager by profession, his wife the owner of an Anheuser-Busch distributor (RR., Vol. 162,\n     lines 14-25). Landolt stated Cross-Appellant represents he and his wife in a suit against their\n     homeowner’s association. Landolt testified he was kept well-informed by Griffin and had no\n     problem finding out about his case (id. 10 at 162, lines 14-25; 163, lines 1-22). Landolt paid\n     an initial retainer of $15,000.00 and ultimately a fee of $70,000.00 (id. at 163, lines 22-25;\n     164, lines 1-11).\n16\n     Truscott identified herself as a practicing attorney, having been licensed since November,\n     1980 (RR., Vol. 11 at 7, lines 19-25). Truscott is a graduate of the University of Texas\n     School of Law, graduating in 1980 (id. at 8, lines 23-25; 9, lines 1-2), a former assistant\n     district attorney in the Galveston County District Attorney’s Office (id. at 9, lines 3-15) and\n     currently has a practice which concentrates on family law (id. at 8, lines 5-6). Truscott\n     affirmed she appeared at the deposition of Barbara Schlein at a time Cross-Appellant was\n     required to be elsewhere (id. at 9, lines 16-25; 10, lines 1-23).\n17\n     Mary Alice Luna identified herself as a former client of Cross-Appellant. Luna is a retired\n     Registered Nurse, a bachelor’s degree in nursing from the University of Texas, a Master’s\n     degree from HBU, a teaching certificate from Prairie View A & M (RR., Vol. 11 at 13, lines\n     1-16). Luna testified she hired Cross-Appellant in a real estate dispute. He testified with\n     regards to Griffin’s character (good) and his work as a lawyer (kept informed) (id. at 13, lines\n     19-25; 14, lines 1-25; 15, lines 1-3).\n18\n      Joanna Mora identified herself as a former client of Cross-Appellant. Mora hired Griffin\n     because of his reputation and after her mother read an article in Texas Monthly (RR., Vol. 11\n     at 154, lines 22-25; 16, lines 1-11). Mora hired Cross-Appellant in a divorce matter, after he\n     explained he was not a family lawyer (id. at 16, lines 11-19). Griffin explained he could\n     refer her to other lawyer, but she decided to hire because of her husband being in law\n     enforcement (id. at 16, lines 15-25; 17, lines 1-25). She, Mora, too testified with regards to\n     Cross-Appellant’s character (kept informed and reliable) (id. at 18, lines 10-21).\n19\n       Lloyd Gilliam identified himself as a current client of Cross-Appellant. Gilliam is a self-\n     employed in the oil industry and hired Cross-Appellant in a nuisance case along with 28\n     other families in the Santa Fe, Texas area (RR., Vol. 27, lines 23-25; 28, lines 1-21). Gilliam\n     explained the case is at the Houston Court of Appeals for the second time (id. at 29, lines 4-\n     25) and attested to Cross-Appellant’s character even in cases where politics may intrude in\n     the case (id.). He too testified Cross-Appellant has kept him informed and to Cross-\n     Appellant’s good character (id. at 30, lines 1-25; 31, lines 1-18).\n\n                                                 24\n\f      After the admission of character related evidence, Cross-Appellant testified\n\nwith regards to his own character, explaining he was licensed on May 15, 1978.\n\nCross-Appellant identified his previous work included serving as General Counsel\n\nfor both the Texas Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP, both on a statewide\n\nbasis. Cross-Appellant has served as an adjunct professor at the University of\n\nHouston Law Center, teaching both civil and criminal trial advocacy (id. at 79,\n\nlines 4-25). Griffin explained he has published in both legal and non-legal circles\n\n(id. at 80, lines 8-20), and was the first recipient of the Justice William Brennan\n\nAward for his representation of the Texas Knight of the Ku Klux Klan (id. at 80,\n\nlines 8-25; 81, lines 1-25; 82, lines 1-9). Cross-Appellant testified his trial and\n\nappellate work was throughout the country (id. at 82, lines 9-15); in the Schlein\n\nmatter he filed two mandamuses with the court of appeal (id.) - All in an attempt to\n\nmake the trial process fairer for the client.\n\n      Cross-Appellant explained his practice and history created circumstances\n\nwhere at times his enemies became his friends, or his friends became his enemies -\n\ndepending of the case. He testified that divorces were not a routine part of his\n\npractice, an election he made because, “[t]hey’re emotionally too hard (id. at 83,\n\nlines 4-25; 84, line 1; 84, lines 13-25).\n\n      Cross-Appellant billed at $300.00 an hour at 352.5 hours, for a bill in the\n\namount of $105,750.00. The copy costs was $18,000.00, the expenses on behalf of\n\n\n                                            25\n\fthe client was $4,399.29 for a total of $128,149.29 (id. at 85, lines 14-25; 86, lines\n\n1-6).\n\n        Genevieve McGarvey, a licensed lawyer, testified on behalf of Cross-\n\nAppellant. McGarvey testified she has known Cross-Appellant since 1991 or 1992\n\n(RR., Vol. 10 at 94, lines 12-25). McGarvey explained her previous career was as\n\na social worker and peace officer. When she worked as a peace officer she was\n\nemployed by the University of Texas System and rose to the rank of Sergeant (id.\n\nat 95, lines 1-9). McGarvey is a partner in the firm of McLeod, Alexander located\n\nin Galveston, Texas (id. at 96, lines 13-15); some twenty five percent of her\n\npractice is family (id. at 97, lines 20-25).\n\n        McGarvey testified she knew Cross-Appellant’s reputation in the\n\ncommunity, having met Cross-Appellant during litigation styled [Arceaneaux] v.\n\nCity of Galveston (voting rights dispute) (id. at 98, lines 17-25). McGarvey\n\nexpressed the view the hourly rate and fee of Cross-Appellant was reasonable and\n\nnecessary (id. at 100, lines 11-25; 101, lines 1-25; 102, lines 17-25; 103, lines 1-\n\n18).    On cross-examination she reaffirmed her view of Cross-Appellant’s good\n\ncharacter of Cross-Appellant (id. at 1054, lines 10-18; 106, lines 1-25; 107, lines 1-\n\n25) (expressing the same view even in light of the recent adverse events).\n\n        The last witness who testified in Cross-Appellant’s case-in-chief was his\n\ncounsel, Norma Venso. Venso identified herself as being licensed February 1978,\n\n\n                                           26\n\fafter graduating from the University of Texas Law School in December 1977 (RR.,\n\nVol. 10 at 110, lines 17-25). Venso served as a trial lawyer for 17 years prior to\n\nbeing elected to the 56th Judicial District Court, Galveston County, Texas (id.).\n\nShe served as a judge from 1997 to 2004 (id. at 111, lines 1-4).\n\n       Venso’s rate charged was $425.00 an hour.                She testified the fee was\n\nreasonable and necessary in the Houston Galveston legal market (id. at 111, lines\n\n5-13). Her hours billed was 29.5 hours for fees in the amount of $29,962.50\n\n(testifying she cut her hours half). She continued to explain, “The hundred hours\n\nthat had been in my report, the first hundred hours have been reduced to 70.5 and\n\nso adding to that another 69.5; and by the way, we estimated the trial work to be 40\n\nhours, which is way less than what it’s actually turned out to be; but that comes up\n\nto a total of $59,500.00 (id. at 112, lines 6-24).\n\n       The trial court granted Cross-Appellant’s requested dismissal on the claim\n\ndirected at the defamation claim (RR., Vol. 12 at 104, line 25; 105-109, lines 1-25;\n\n110, lines 1-16). After the charge conference, the Appellant elected not to submit\n\nany questions on the malpractice allegations (RR., Vol. 12 at 103, line 25; 104, line\n\n1-25).

In response to the\n\ndamage questions on these questions, the jury found no actual damages suffered\n\n(Question 20), but found punitive damages in the amount of $5,000.00 (Question\n\n21); all which is part of parcel of the issues brought by the Cross-Appellant to this\n\nCourt.\n\n         It is in this factual context this matter is before this Honorable Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\f                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      There was a finding of unconscionable conduct (Question 18) against Cross-\n\nAppellant Griffin.     With respect to the questions of damages for the\n\nunconscionable conduct, the answer was none (zero) (Question 20). There was a\n\nfinding the unconscionable conduct was knowingly (Question 19), and with\n\nregards to the additional damage question there was a finding of $5,000.00, even\n\nthough there was no actual damage finding. This finding cannot stand as a matter\n\nof law (see Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Reed, 711 S.W.2d 617, 618 (Tex. 1986)\n\n(reversing the additional damages award under DTPA, “To support an award of\n\nexemplary damages in this case, the plaintiff must prove a distinct tortious injury\n\nwith actual damages. Bellefonte Underwriters Insurance Co. v. Brown, supra;\n\nLuna v. North Star Dodge Sales, Inc., supra; City Products Corp. v. Berman,\n\nsupra. The only issue on actual damages inquired as to the cost of repairing the\n\nhome to the condition it was represented to be in at the time of sale. Although the\n\nReeds sought recovery for mental anguish in their petition, no issue was submitted\n\non those damages.”) In the case at bar, the question is cleaner – there was an\n\nadverse finding on the actual damages question.\n\n      Lawyers’ work involve advice, judgment or legal opinions, and are not\n\ncognizable under the DTPA under Texas’s common law rule against “fracturing”\n\nor are exempt from its application under Section 17.49(c) (see Brennan v.\n\n\n\n                                        39\n\fManning, No. 07-06-0041-CV, 2007 WL 1098476 (Tex.

App.-Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2005) (plaintiffs claim that attorney created confusion as to the source of\n\nservices by representing that he was board certified when he was not, and by\n\nleading plaintiff to believe that a paralegal was an attorney, which plaintiff claimed\n\ncaused him to weigh the firm’s advice with undue favor, was barred by Section\n\n17.49(c)); Head v. U.S. Inspect DFW, Inc., 159 S.W.3d 731 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth\n\n2005) (a DTPA claim premised on representations by a home inspection company\n\nthat a licensed real estate inspector would do the inspection, when an unlicensed\n\napprentice was used, was a claim that the inspector was negligent in rendering an\n\nerroneous opinion based upon an apprentice’s unsupervised inspection, and was\n\ntherefore an inseparable part of the professional services and was barred by the\n\nDTPA); Greathouse v. McConnell, 982 S.W.2d 165 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1998) (alleged false representation that legal services were of competent quality\n\nwas a re-stated negligence claim not cognizable under the DTPA.\n\n      In the case at bar, nothing in the case represented any actions outside the\n\nexempted areas of advice, judgment and opinion. In addition, the Court’s Jury\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fCharge gives no guidance as to the alleged action which allegedly was\n\nunconscionable (“Did Anthony Griffin engage in any unconscionable action or\n\ncourse of action that was a producing cause of damages to Barbara Schlein?”).\n\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      When a party attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue\n\nit did not have the burden to prove at trial, it must demonstrate that there is no\n\nevidence to support the adverse finding (Aquila Southwest Pipeline, Inc. v.\n\nHarmony Exploration, Inc., 48 S.W.3d 225, 236 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2001, pet.\n\ndenied)). In reviewing a no-evidence issue, this Court is required to consider all of\n\nthe record evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every\n\nreasonable inference from that evidence in support of the verdict. Id. This Court\n\nmust determine whether the proffered evidence as a whole rises to a level that\n\nwould \"enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusion\"\n\n(Transp. Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 25 (Tex. 1994)).\n\n      A challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence must be sustained when\n\nthe record discloses one of the following: (1) a complete absence of evidence of a\n\nvital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight to\n\nthe only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a\n\nvital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence conclusively\n\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\festablishes the opposite of a vital fact (Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953\n\nS.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997)).\n\n      When reviewing a challenge to the factual sufficiency of the evidence, this\n\nCourt must consider all of the evidence in the record (see Plas-Tex, Inc. v. U.S.\n\nSteel Corp., 772 S.W.2d 442, 445 (Tex.1989)). If a party is attacking the factual\n\nsufficiency of an adverse finding when the other party has the burden of proof that\n\nparty must demonstrate there is insufficient evidence to support the adverse finding\n\n(Aquila, 48 S.W.3d at 236). In reviewing a factual insufficiency challenge, we\n\nweigh and examine all of the evidence that supports the verdict and that which is\n\ncontrary to it. Id. We set aside the verdict only if the evidence is so weak the\n\nverdict is clearly wrong and manifestly unjust (see Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175,\n\n176 (Tex.1986); see also Jabri v Alsayyed, 145 S.W.3d 664 (Tex.

(a) Nothing in this subchapter shall apply to the\n               owner or employees of a regularly published newspaper, magazine, or telephone\n               directory, or broadcast station, or billboard, wherein any advertisement in\n               violation of this subchapter is published or disseminated, unless it is established\n               that the owner or employees of the advertising medium have knowledge of the\n\n                                                46\n\ffalse, deceptive, or misleading acts or practices declared to be unlawful by this\nsubchapter, or had a direct or substantial financial interest in the sale or\ndistribution of the unlawfully advertised good or service. Financial interest as\nused in this section relates to an expectation which would be the direct result of\nsuch advertisement.\n    (b) Nothing in this subchapter shall apply to acts or practices authorized under\n    specific rules or regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission\n    under Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C.A.\n    45(a)(1)]. The provisions of this subchapter do apply to any act or practice\n    prohibited or not specifically authorized by a rule or regulation of the Federal\n    Trade Commission. An act or practice is not specifically authorized if no rule\n    or regulation has been issued on the act or practice.\n    (c) Nothing in this subchapter shall apply to a claim for damages based\n    on the rendering of a professional service, the essence of which is the\n    providing of advice, judgment, opinion, or similar professional skill. This\n    exemption does not apply to:\n             (1) an express misrepresentation of a material fact that cannot be\n             characterized as advice, judgment, or opinion;\n             (2)     a failure to disclose information in violation of Section\n             17.46(b)(24);\n             (3) an unconscionable action or course of action that cannot be\n             characterized as advice, judgment, or opinion;\n             (4) breach of an express warranty that cannot be characterized as\n             advice, judgment, or opinion; or\n             (5) a violation of Section 17.46(b)(26).\n     (d) Subsection (c) applies to a cause of action brought against the person who\n     provided the professional service and a cause of action brought against any\n     entity that could be found to be vicariously liable for the person's conduct.\n              (e) Except as specifically provided by Subsections (b) and (h),\n              Section 17.50, nothing in this subchapter shall apply to a cause of\n              action for bodily injury or death or for the infliction of mental\n              anguish.\n     (f) Nothing in the subchapter shall apply to a claim arising out of a\n     written contract if:\n             (1) the contract relates to a transaction, a project, or a set of\n             transactions related to the same project involving total\n             consideration by the consumer of more than $100,000;\n             (2) in negotiating the contract the consumer is represented by legal\n             counsel who is not directly or indirectly identified, suggested, or\n             selected by the defendant or an agent of the defendant; and\n               (3) the contract does not involve the consumer's residence.\n     (g) Nothing in this subchapter shall apply to a cause of action arising from a\n    transaction, a project, or a set of transactions relating to the same project,\n    involving total consideration by the consumer of more than $500,000, other\n\n                                47\n\f         Section 17.49(c) of the Texas Deceptive Trade practices Act (\"DTPA\")\n\nstates the statute is inapplicable to \"a claim for damages based on the rendering of\n\na professional service, the essence of which is the providing of advice, judgment,\n\nopinion, or similar professional skill\" (Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.49(c)). A\n\nprofessional service is one that consists of acts particular to the individual's\n\nspecialized vocation (Nast v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 82 S.W.3d 114, 122\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.)).

In addition, the Court’s Jury\n\nCharge gives no guidance as to the alleged action which allegedly was\n\nunconscionable (“Did Anthony Griffin engage in any unconscionable action or\n\ncourse of action that was a producing cause of damages to Barbara Schlein?”).24\n\nCross-Appellant’s evidence centered around four allegations: 1) failure to file in\n\nthe insurance claim; 2) failure to continue on Defendant’s case; 3) failure to return\n\nthe Cross-Appellant’s file and property; 4) failure to follow the terms of the alleged\n\nagreement that the fee was a flat fee of $35,000.00.\n\n\n23\n     See the case of Mazuca and Asssociates v. Schumann, 82 S.W.3d 90, 94 (Tex. App. – San\n     Antonio (2002), wherein the Court explained:\n\n     TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 17.45(5) (Vernon 1987). The 1995 amendments to the\n     DTPA allow an attorney to be held liable for an unconscionable action or course of action\n     that cannot be characterized as advice, judgment, or opinion. Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §\n     17.49(c)(3). It further requires a showing that the resulting unfairness was \"glaringly\n     noticeable, flagrant, complete, and unmitigated....\" Chastain v. Koonce, 700 S.W.2d 579, 584\n     (Tex.1985). In contrast, \"[a] claim based upon the failure to exercise that degree of care, skill\n     and diligence that a lawyer of ordinary skill and knowledge commonly possesses and\n     exercises, despite its label, is a malpractice claim.\" Kahlig v. Boyd, 980 S.W.2d 685, 689\n     (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1998, pet. denied).\n24\n     The definition of unconscionable action or course of action in the charge was defined from\n     the Act (id. at Section 17.45(5)).\n\n                                                  50\n\f      Appellant Schlein’s expert (Hardwick) testified to a breach of fiduciary\n\nresponsibility and used the word “unconscionable” in describing alleged violations\n\nby Cross-Appellant. Hardwick also asserted in context of the breach of fiduciary\n\nresponsibility, Cross-Appellant file the underlying lawsuit and asserting false\n\nallegations in the original petition. Hardwick stated she was hired by Appellant to\n\nfigure out which of the attorney’s fiduciary duties might have been violated by\n\nCross-Appellant (RR., Vol. 10 at 122, lines 13-20). Hardwick expressed a view\n\nCross-Appellant violated his duty of loyalty, candor, and confidentiality (id. at 123,\n\nlines 9-21). All related to a finding the jury found against Appellant (breach of\n\nfiduciary responsibility).\n\n      Hardwick’s testimony is insufficient to get around the exemption engrafted\n\nin the law. With regards to the issue of false allegations in the original petition,\n\nthis issue was resolved when the claim was dismissed at the close of Cross-\n\nAppellant’s case (e.g., litigation exception under both the Disciplinary Rules\n\n(claim or defense), and litigation exception associated with legal pleadings/court\n\nproceedings. Hardwick also testified the contract itself was unconscionable and\n\nwas not clear enough for the consumer. Hardwick’s testimony is not sufficient in\n\nlight of her self-imposed limitations of her testimony, that is, to testify only with\n\nregards to matters related to breach of fiduciary responsibility.         It is worth\n\nrepeating, “The 1995 amendments to the DTPA allow an attorney to be held liable\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\ffor an unconscionable action or course of action that cannot be characterized as\n\nadvice, judgment, or opinion.

In Texas\n\nMotor Coach, L.C. v. Blue Bird Body Co., No. 4:05CV34, 2005 WL 3132482\n\n(E.D. Tex. Nov. 22, 2005), a motor coach dealer entered into a franchise dealership\n\nagreement with a manufacturer. The motor coach dealer constructed improvements\n\non real property, obtained floor plan financing to operate the franchise, hired\n\nemployees, and expended funds on advertising. Later, the manufacturer delivered\n\nthree motor coaches, which were determined to be defective and were returned.\n\nThe court dismissed the plaintiffs DTPA claims, finding that because the contract”\n\nassumed delivery” of three motor coaches, the cost of which were in excess of\n\n$200,000 each, the exemptions under Section 17.49(f) and (g) barred relief.\n\nSimilarly, in East Hill Marine, Inc. v. Rinker Boat Co., 229 S.W.3d 813 (Tex.\n\nApp.-Fort Worth 2007), the parties entered into a dealership agreement, with no\n\nminimum purchase requirement. The plaintiff, however, ultimately ordered boats\n\nfrom the defendant worth more than $859,000. The court ruled that the Section\n\n17.49(g) exemption applied to bar the plaintiffs’ claims. The plaintiff argued that at\n\nthe time the dealer relationship was established, there was no promise to pay more\n\nthan $500,000; rather, the plaintiff argued, there was merely an agreement under\n\nwhich it might never purchase anything. The fees and costs incurred by Anthony\n\nP. Griffin in this case exceeded $100,000.00 and as such the contract and services\n\nrendered are exempt under the statute. In addition, subsection (2) is met in light of\n\n\n                                         53\n\fAppellant’s testimony reflecting she visited Cross-Appellant’s office on the advice\n\nof Marie Trefethern, a lawyer, who recommended she come because of the alleged\n\n$35,000.00 flat fee.     There is no evidence the lawyer (Trefethern) was\n\nrecommended, suggested or selected by Cross-Appellant.\n\n       The trial court erred in not granting the JNOV. The judgment should be set\n\naside and rendered in Cross-Appellant’s favor on no evidence and insufficient\n\nevidence grounds.\n\n                            PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n      Cross-Appellant prays in this his initial brief on appeal the judgment finding\n\nof unconscionable act be reversed and rendered, as well as the additional damage\n\nfinding of $5,000.00\n\n      DATE: February 12, 2015.\n\n                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                      /s/ Norma Venso\n                                      Norma Venso\n                                      State Bar No. 205456250\n                                      830 Apollo Lane\n                                      Houston, Texas 77058\n                                      (409) 789.8661\n                                      281.286.9990 (facsimile)\n                                      nvenso@earthlink.net\n\n                                      ATTORNEYS FOR\n                                      CROSS-APPELLANT\n                                      ANTHONY P.

The contract called for the\n\nDefendant to pay to Plaintiff an initial retainer of $35,000.00\n\nand for counsel to be paid a reduced hourly rate of $250.00 an\n\nhour for any work over $35,000.00.         The contract was entered\n\nwith knowledge of previous counsel's representation of the\n\nDefendant and the long-term and protracted nature of the\n\nunderlying family/business law litigation. 1         Even though\n\nreferenced in the contract, the Defendant never paid the initial\n\nretainer of $35,000.00, but explained to Plaintiff that she was\n\ntrustworthy, that she always paid her bills and that if the\n\nPlaintiff took care of her interest, she would take care of him.\n\nPlaintiff explained that she simply had to abide with the terms\n\nof the contract.\n\n         Plaintiff represented Defendant in the family litigation\n\nand maintained business records during the course of the\n\nrepresentation.      At the end of the representation,       Plaintiff\n\n\n\n1\n  In the Matter of the Marriage of Barbara Regina Schlein and Robert John\nSchlein; Case No. 08FD2371; in the County Court at Law, No. 2, Galveston,\nCounty, Texas.\n                                      2\n\n\n\n                                                                            000011\n                     Cross-Appellant's Appendix11\n\f000012\n\n\n\n\nforwarded a bill setting out the total amount of time expended\n\non Plaintiff's behalf was 352.50 hours for a total of\n\n$88,125.00.         Plaintiff's office also incurred some $22,339.29 in\n\ncosts.         The total attorneys'   fee and costs incurred on behalf of\n\nthe client and due and owing is $110,524.29.\n\n         Plaintiff sues for this amount and prays for judgment.\n\n                                         IV.\n\n                       Additional Work -       Quantum Meruit\n\n         Plaintiff also engaged in other work for Defendant that was\n\nexternal to the contract of employment surrounding the family\n\nlitigation.         The agreement of representation was based upon\n\ntrust and promises that Defendant was \"honest, trustworthy and a\n\nChristian woman and that she paid her bills\" (Defendant's\n\nwords).         Plaintiff was informed by Defendant on multiple\n\noccasions that if her money in the family case was cleared up\n\nshe would immediately get Plaintiff paid - \"trust me.\"               The\n\nworked performed on Defendant's behalf included the following:\n\n         i)      Civil litigation over debt in Justice Court       (Bank of\n\n                America v. Barbara and Robert Schlein) -        the defense\n\n                was successful;\n\n         ii)     Criminal litigation in criminal case       (State of Texas\n\n                 v.

Centre Builders, et al.;       in the\n\n                lOth Judicial District Court; Galveston County, Texas);\n\n         vii)   Representation of Barbara Schlein in litigation in\n\n                real estate litigation and lien placed on community\n\n                property (Barbara Schlein v. Robert Schlein and Bill\n\n                De La Garza,   et al.,   in the 212th Judicial District\n\n                Court; Galveston County, Texas).\n\n         The reasonable value of the subject work is sixty\n\n\n                                          4\n\n\n                                                                            000013\n                       Cross-Appellant's Appendix13\n\f000014\n\n\n\n\nthousand ($60,000.00) dollars; this amount does not include the\n\ncontingent fee in existence in the building negligence matter\n\npending in Galveston County.      Plaintiff sues for his reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney's fees and costs incurred on behalf of\n\nPlaintiff in these cases     ($15,000.00 in costs).    Plaintiff seeks\n\na declaratory judgment with respect to the contingent fee\n\ncontract on the construction litigation that the contract is a\n\nvalid and enforceable contract and remains in effects.\n\n                                   v.\n                            Unjust Enrichment\n\n         Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above information\n\nfor all purposes.      In addition and/or in the alternative to the\n\nforegoing,     Plaintiff would show that it is entitled to recover\n\nunder the doctrine of unjust enrichment.        According to this\n\nequitable principle of justice, equity, and/or good conscience,\n\nPlaintiff is entitled to recover for the products, materials,\n\nand services that Defendant received and benefited from without\n\ncompensating Plaintiff.      Under the theory of unjust enrichment,\n\nPlaintiff is entitled to recover all actual damages, together\n\nwith attorneys'     fees and costs of Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\n\n\n                                                                    000014\n                     Cross-Appellant's Appendix14\n\f000015\n\n\n\n\n                                    VI.\n\n                             Fraud Allegations\n\n         Plaintiff brings suit on the basis of fraud.   It is\n\nPlaintiff's contention that Defendant has defrauded both him and\n\nthe court during the course of the contractual relationship.\n\nPlaintiff signed a contract imposing an obligation on the client\n\nto be honest in her dealings with the Plaintiff and the court.\n\nThe applicable language under the contract reads as follows:\n\n                   Withdrawal, Malfeasance, Breach of Contract\n         1.   Withdrawal:  Lawyers have an ethical obligation to\n              represent the Client zealously within the bounds of the\n              law, but the Lawyers also have an obligation, when\n              material representation surfaces or where there is a\n              breach of the terms of this contract by the Client, to\n              withdraw from the representation of the Client.\n              Nothing in this contract guarantees any results,\n              including whether a suit will or will not be filed or\n              any other matters that border on guarantees.   The only\n              guarantee relates to the representation within the\n              confines of the Code of Professional Responsibility\n              (zealously within the bounds of the law).   It has been\n              explained orally that the Lawyers' obligation to the\n              Court and the rules of ethics require investigation and\n              examination of the facts.\n         2.   Investigation/If No Case:   If the facts reveal no case\n              exists, the Lawyer shall promptly advise the client and\n              terminate the relationship.   The retainer again is non-\n              refundable.\n\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\n\n                                                                   000015\n                      Cross-Appellant's Appendix15\n\f000016\n\n\n\n\n         3.   Investigation/Material Breach:  If the\n              investigation reveals a material breach, lie, or\n              misstatement by the client, the Lawyer will advise\n              the Client as to how such breach affects the\n              Lawyer's ability to proceed in the representation.\n              If termination is appropriate, the Lawyer(s) shall\n              advise the client of her rights and shall promptly\n              take any necessary acts to protect the Client\n              (advise as to action) and the firm's rights.\n              Again, the retainer shall be deemed non-\n              refundable.\n\n\n    Prior to the signing of the contract, the contract was\n\n    explained to the client and Plaintiff relied upon\n\n    Defendant's statements with regard to telling the truth, be\n\n    forthright and honest and not to conceal any information\n\n    during the process.        Defendant affirmed her understanding\n\n    and held out that she would remain honest and that she\n\n    would not conceal information from Plaintiff and/or from\n\n    the Court.        However, during the course of the relationship,\n\n    Defendants actions revealed fraud that struck at the\n\n    fundamental relationship between the parties.        These\n\n    actions included the following:\n\n                 1)      Requesting to see banking records before the\n\n                         lawyer after banking records were tendered\n\n                        by the banking entity.   After the lawyer\n\n                         learned that the client had gone through the\n\n                         records prior to his review, copying and\n\n                         tendering to the other side, he prohibited\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n                                                                        000016\n                         Cross-Appellant's Appendix16\n\f000017\n\n\n\n\n              the client's access to any such documents\n\n              until after the lawyer touched the documents\n\n              first;\n\n         2)   In preparation for trial, the lawyer\n\n              discovered a discrepancy in checks and the\n\n              financial records and inquired of the\n\n              client.    In the discussion, the lawyer\n\n              became angry and stated that \"if I was the\n\n              judge, I would put you in jail.\"    The\n\n              Defendant, instead of addressing the\n\n              problem/discrepancy the client engaged in\n\n              tears and continued to repeat .... \"I don't\n\n              know.\"    When the contradiction was revealed\n\n              in the examination, the client simply\n\n              stated, \"I just have to go to jail.\"       The\n\n              client was instructed that if the question\n\n              was asked at a trial or hearing, Defendant\n\n              had to answer honestly, even if it meant not\n\n              answering and/or repeating her statement, \"I\n\n              just have to go to jail.\"    The question was\n\n              not asked at trial;\n\n         3)   The client held out to Plaintiff that his\n\n              fees would be paid.    \"I have the money, I\n\n              will pay you.    You trust me don't you?\"\n\n\n\n                              8\n                                                               000017\n              Cross-Appellant's Appendix17\n\f000018\n\n\n\n\n              Defendant explained that when the process\n\n              was over she would immediately get a check\n\n              issued to pay Plaintiff.   Plaintiff relied\n\n              on these statements.\n\n         4)   After the presentation of the bill,\n\n              Plaintiff explained in the bill and orally\n\n              that he would discount the bill   (fees and\n\n              costs), in order to make it better on the\n\n              client and in order to receive compensation.\n\n              On or about October 28, 2011,   Plaintiff was\n\n              informed by Defendant that she would not and\n\n              could not pay Plaintiff's fees.    Plaintiff\n\n              had been informed that she had worked with\n\n              her financial advisor, Ritchie Faulk to\n\n              protect her funds from collection.    In the\n\n              conversation of October 28, 2011, Defendant\n\n              said the funds were placed in an IRA and\n\n              that she could not remove the same until she\n\n              was 59.   Presumably, Defendant wanted\n\n              Plaintiff to wait until a period of in\n\n              excess of ten (10) years for compensation.\n\n              The Defendant's statement was related to the\n\n              IRA is inconsistent with Defendant holding\n\n              out that after taking out \"your\" lawyer's\n\n\n\n                             9\n                                                              000018\n              Cross-Appellant's Appendix18\n\f000019\n\n\n\n\n                           fees,   I will place my other funds in a\n\n                          protective status.     Plaintiff relied on the\n\n                           Defendant's statements.\n\n            Plaintiff has been defrauded by Defendant and seeks a\n\n    judgment finding that \"fraud\" has taken place.\n\n                                         VII.\n\n                      Theft of Services - Theft Liability Act\n\n            Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above factual\n\n    paragraphs setting out the factual history.

See Contractual Agreement (hereinafter \"Contractual Agreement,\" attached as Exhibit\n\nA). The Contractual Agreement provides for a $35,000 retainer fee to be paid by Schlein, subject\n\nto an understanding that there was a court order which prevented Schlein from expending funds\n\nwithout approval of the court. Ex. A. The Contractual Agreement further provides that the retainer\n\nis \"non-refundable\" and that \"once the fee is paid, it shall be deemed earned.\" Ex. A.\n\n         2.2    Griffin supplemented the Contractual Agreement by providing Schlein with an\n\nExplanation of Contract and Letter Agreement (hereinafter \"Letter Agreement,\" attached as Exhibit\n\nB. The Letter Agreement provides that the \"contract relates to the family matter but contemplates\n\nadding claims and/or amending the pleadings\" in a separate pending action. !d.

Ex. B.\n\n         2.4      On October 24, 2011, a Final Decree of Divorce was entered for Schlein. See Final\n\nDecree of Divorce (attached as Exhibit C). In this Final Decree, the court awarded to Schlein several\n\npallets of Travertine marble as her sole and separate property. !d. at 3. Furthermore, the court\n\nspecifically stated that this Travertine marble belonging to Schlein was in Griffin's possession. !d.\n\n         2.5      Professional appraisal of this Travertine marble has been valuated at $56,338.85. See\n\nProduct Appraisal (attached as Exhibit D).\n\n         2.6    Following this resolution of her divorce proceedings, Griffin accepted this Travertine\n\nmarble as payment for legal services rendered.\n\n                                     BREACH OF CONTRACT\n\n         3 .I     All proceeding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference. There was a valid,\n\nenforceable contract-specifically the Contractual Agreement and Letter Agreement-between the\n\nparties to this suit. Schlein fully performed her duties under the Contractual Agreement and Letter\n\nAgreement. Griffin failed to perform his duties and breached the Contractual Agreement and Letter\n\nAgreement. Griffin's breach proximately caused Schlein's injury. As a result, Schlein seeks to\n\nrecover actual damages, benefit of the bargain damages, and reliance damages.\n\n                                      LEGAL MALPRACTICE\n\n         4 .I     All proceeding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference. As her attorney,\n\nGriffin owed a duty of care to Schlein. Griffin's negligent acts and/or omissions breached that duty.\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT'S AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM                                                PAGE 3 OF 6\n                                                                                                   000028\n                             Cross-Appellant's Appendix25\n\f000029\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of Griffin's breach, Schlein was injured and suffered damages. As a result, Schlein seeks\n\nto recover actual damages, benefit of the bargain damages, and reliance damages.\n\n                                BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY\n\n         5 .I   All proceeding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference. As a result of the\n\nattorney-client relationship, Griffin owed a fiduciary duty to Schlein. Griffin breached his fiduciary\n\nduty by failing to do one or more of the following actions: (I) preserve client confidences; (2)\n\nrepresent the client with undivided loyalty; (3) act with absolute perfect candor, openness and\n\nhonesty without any concealment or deception; (4) to be strictly honest about the fee arrangement\n\nand refrain from self dealing; (5) inform client of matters material to the representation; (6) to turn\n\nover funds belonging to the client; and (7) to follow the client's instructions. As a result ofGriffin's\n\nbreach, Schlein was injured and suffered damages. Furthermore, Griffin also benefitted financially\n\nfrom the breach. As a result, Schlein seeks to recover actual damages, benefit of the bargain\n\ndamages, and reliance damages.\n\n                                               FRAUD\n\n         6.1    All proceeding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference. Griffin made a\n\nmaterial representation to Schlein in the Contractual Agreement and Letter Agreement that any\n\nGriffin's representation of Schlein in any additional matters would be on a contingency fee basis and\n\ncovered by a separate agreement. Griffin knew this representation was false at the time it was made.\n\nGriffin made this representation to Schlein with the intent that she rely on the representation and\n\nenter into the Contractual and Letter Agreements. Schlein relied on these representations and entered\n\ninto the Contractual and Letter Agreements with Griffin, and as a result she was injured. As a result,\n\nSchlein seeks to recover actual damages, benefit of the bargain damages, attorney's fees and reliance\n\ndamages.\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT'S AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM                                               PAGE 4 OF 6\n                                                                                                  000029\n                            Cross-Appellant's Appendix26\n\f000030\n\n\n\n\n                            FRAUD FOR FAILURE TO DISCLOSE\n\n         7 .I   All proceeding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference. Griffin concealed\n\nmaterial facts relating to the his representation of Schlein from her. Due to the fiduciary relationship\n\nbetween the parties, Griffin had a duty to disclose these facts to Schlein. The omitted facts were\n\nmaterial to the decisions that were made by Schlein. Griffin knew that Schlein was ignorant of the\n\nfacts and that she did not have an opportunity to discover the facts. Griffin was deliberately silent\n\nregarding the material facts and intended to induce Schlein to sign the Contractual Agreement by\n\nomitting these facts. Schlein relied on Griffin's non-disclosure when consenting to the Contractual\n\nand Letter Agreements and as a result was injured. Schlein seeks to recover attorney's fees pursuant\n\nto Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ch. 38.\n\n                                  DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\n         8.1    Defendant hereby demands a trial by jury and tenders the appropriate fee.\n\n                                         RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n         WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant respectfully requests the Court to\n\ndismiss this suit or render judgment that Plaintiff take nothing by reason of this suit. Furthermore,\n\nupon trial of this case, Counter-Plaintiff Schlein respectfully asks to be awarded:\n\n                a.     Actual damages;\n\n                b.      Exemplary damages;\n\n                c.      Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest;\n\n                d.      Costs of suit;\n\n                e.     Attorney's fees pursuant to Tex. Civ.

GRIFFIN,\n                        BRIEF ON APPEAL\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUSTICES FOR THE FIRST COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Cross-Appellant, Anthony P. Griffin, hereinafter and sometimes referred to\n\nCross-Appellant Griffin, submits his initial brief, with respect to his cross-appeal in\n\nthis matter. Cross-Appellant submits as follows:\n\n       STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      Cross-Appellant brought his original petition on March 14, 2013 against\n\nAppellant, Barbara Regina Schlein (Index on Appeal at Tab 1, CR [Clerk’s\n\fRecord], at 000003-000009; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 1; see also\n\nPlaintiff’s Original Petition at id. at CR 10-21; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab\n\n2). Cross-Appellant complained that Appellant, a former client, breached her\n\ncontract of employment by failing to pay his attorneys’ fee and costs. The initial\n\npleading also asserted alternative theories of recovery, including quantum meruit,\n\nunjust enrichment, fraud, and theft of services (id.).       Appellant’s operative\n\npleading/answer, at that the time of trial, was Defendant’s Amended Answer and\n\nCounterclaim filed on June 18, 2013 (CR. 00026-00059; Cross-Appellant’s\n\nAppendix, Tab 3). Cross-Appellant filed a partial motion for summary judgment\n\non September 30, 2013 (CR. at 223-286) and his amended petition on October 4,\n\n2014 (CR 287-292); Cross-Appellant’s amended petition dropped all claims save\n\nthe breach of contract claim (id., see first amended petition at CR. at 287-292; see\n\nsecond amended petition at CR. at 628-632; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 4).\n\nThe order denying the partial motion for summary judgment was entered on\n\nDecember 27, 2013 (CR. at 420; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 5).\n\nDefendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment was filed on January 31, 2013 (CR. at\n\n472-558). The Court likewise denied Defendant’s Motion on February 28, 2014\n\n(CR. at 751; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 6).\n\n      The case was called to trial on May 8, 2014 (jury) and was tried on the\n\nfollowing days, to-wit: May 7– 9, 12-13, 19, 21-22, 27, 2014 (Reporter’s Record\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f[RR.], Master Index, Vol. 1). The jury rendered a verdict on May 22, 2014 (RR. at\n\nVol. 13; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 7 (jury charge), found at CR. at [SUPP.\n\nCLERK RECORD]; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 8 (verdict confirmation by\n\njury). Cross-Appellant filed his motion to enter a final judgment on June 12, 2014\n\n(CR at 1135-1155); he amended the amended motion on June 13, 2014 (CR. 1166-\n\n1186).   Contained in Cross-Appellant’s motion for judgment as a motion for\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict on certain unsupported portions of the\n\nverdict; the trial court denied the motion notwithstanding and entered a final\n\njudgment on June 30, 2014 (CR. at 1208; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 9; CR.\n\nat 1249-1250; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 10).\n\n      Appellant Schlein filed a motion for new trial on July 30, 2014 (CR. at\n\n1209-1224). The trial court denied the motion for new trial on September 11, 2014\n\n(CR. at 1245; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 11). Appellant filed her notice of\n\nappeal on September 26, 2014 (CR. at 1238-1241; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix,\n\nTab 12). Cross-Appellant filed his notice of cross-appeal on October 10, 2014\n\n(CR. 1242-1244; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Tab 13).\n\n      This case is properly before this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                      STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      This Court’s jurisdiction vests under Rule 25.1, Texas Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure (commenced by filing a notice of appeal from district court judgment).\n\n                          __________________________\n\n                              STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      During opening statement, counsel for Cross-Appellant Griffin framed the\n\nmatter as a simple breach of contract claims, asserting Appellant Schlein failed to\n\npay attorney’s fees and costs due and owing to Cross-Appellant (RR. at Vol. 4 at\n\n74, lines 19-25; 75, lines 1-19). “I think the evidence will show that she hasn’t\n\npaid him a red cent.” Cross-Appellant’s counsel explanation in opening framed the\n\nunderlying factual history:\n\n      I don’t know of anything that she wanted that he failed to do, but we’ll wait\n\n      and see what happens with that. I don’t think that you’re going to find that\n\n      Mr. Griffin did anything wrong in this case, except get on his horse and act\n\n      as a knight for her, who he thought was an abused woman, who was also not\n\n      getting a fair shake in court and that he took it without getting a fair shake in\n\n      court and that he took it without getting any money up front because they\n\n      couldn’t and he trusted her all the way through and that to this day he has\n\n      not been paid a red cent; and yet, when he sues for collection, they now\n\n      claim that he has malpracticed her in some way. She says that was by him\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       telling her to show up in court for him once. He denies that. I have no idea\n\n       what that’s about and that she wasn’t kept informed.\n\nId. at 82, lines 9-23.\n\n       Appellant Schlein and Cross-Appellant Griffin entered a legal services\n\ncontract on November 3, 2009 (RR., Vol. 14, pp. 5-14; labeled as Plaintiff’s\n\nExhibit 1 (Contractual Agreement) and Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2 (cover letter to\n\ncontract); Cross-Appellant’s Appendix, Attachment 14). The contract explicitly\n\nset out the following language:            representation in “all matters concerning the\n\ndivorce/family related matter/civil issues (tort issues) in a matter styled In the\n\nMatter of the Marriage of Barbara Regina Schlein and Robert Schlein; in the\n\nCounty Court at Law, No. 2; Galveston County, Texas; Cause No. 08FD2371\n\n(supra, Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1).\n\n       The contract required the payment of a retainer of $35,000.00, but also\n\ncontained a footnote stating, “[c]urrently Petitioner is under an order of the Court\n\nthat prevents the expenditure of funds without the approval of the Court. No\n\npayment of fees will take place unless and until the Court approves the payment of\n\nthe retainer amount and/or an order is entered releasing the injunction overbroad\n\nscope (can be interpreted to include separate property of Petitioner).”1\n\n\n\n1\n    At the time of the resolution of the divorce the temporary injunction entered by the trial court\n    had ceased being in effect (RR., Vol. 8 at 90, lines 4-25; 9, lines 1-5).\n\n                                                 5\n\f      The contract also provided the retainer fee should not be interpreted as\n\nconstituting the full reasonable fee to which the Lawyers may be entitled for\n\nservices performed pursuant to an award of the Court or settlement (id. at\n\nunnumbered page 3). The work of Cross-Appellant was billed at $300.00 an hour\n\n(id. at unnumbered page 4). Cross-Appellant’s lawsuit made clear that neither the\n\nretainer nor any additional fees and costs had been paid.\n\n      Appellant was called as the first witness during the trial; when questioned\n\nwhether she had paid “a red cent to Anthony Griffin for his services,” she\n\nresponded, “[t]hat is not true.” When asked what money has been paid, Appellant\n\nexplained, “I have paid him in product, which is the same as money” (RR., Vol. 4\n\nat 101, lines 7-12). Appellant went on to explain it was her belief has overpaid\n\n“[h]e owes me money” (id. at 101, lines 14-21). When the witness was brought to\n\nthe question of “money”, the witness then asked for a definition of money.\n\nAppellant then affirmed she stated she has not “paid him cash dollar money. I’ve\n\npaid him in product (id. at 102, lines 1-4).\n\n      The contract of employment between Appellant and Cross-Appellant was\n\nadmitted as Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1 (id. at 104, lines 1-7; Cross-Appellant’s Appendix,\n\nTab 14). Appellant testified the contract was executed in person (id. at 105, lines\n\n13-25), contained a section relating to the payment of a retainer on hiring A Griffin\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fLawyers/Anthony P. Griffin, Inc. (id. at 107, lines 5-25; 108, lines 1-2).2\n\nAppellant testified the contract did not apply to her, although her signature\n\nappeared on same. Appellant testified the contract was amended orally (id. at 110,\n\nlines 18-25; 111, lines 1-6), “it was explained to me differently and that’s why we\n\nhave a letter of explanation of contract and letter agreement [;] otherwise, there\n\nwould be no purpose for this to have been drawn up” (id.). Appellant stated she\n\nwas given a flat fee of $35,000.00, even though the contract never used the words\n\nflat fee. Appellant against restated her position – she had paid by the tender of\n\nproduct, “Peruvian tile” (id. at 112, lines 3-10).\n\n       And I’ll tell you what: $35,000 is a lot more [sic] than $110,000; and I’m a\n\n       single parent; and trust me, I just didn’t have that kind of money. 3 I wasn’t\n\n\n2\n    Appellant explained Anthony P. Griffin, Inc. was a defunct corporation, and that A Griffin\n    Lawyers was an assumed named used by Anthony P. Griffin, with Anthony P. Griffin being\n    entitled to collect the debts for either entity (RR., Vol. 8 at 86, lines 4-25; 87, lines 1-25; 88,\n    lines 1-15).\n3\n    Appellant was referred to Appellee by a Marie Trefethern (RR., Vol. 6 at 155, line 21-25).\n    At the time, Trefethern was employed on a part-time basis with the Galveston County\n    District Attorney’s Office doing protective orders (id. at 156, lines 1-14) and travelled to\n    Appellee’s office with Appellant. Trefethern participated in the first meeting.\n\n    Appellant had previously been represented by four other lawyers, all family law practitioners\n    (id. at 157, lines 7-25; 158, lines 1-9). Trefethern travelled to Appellee’s office with\n    Appellant (id). Appellant paid her first lawyer, Greg Enos, $21,000.00, for 30 days of work;\n    her second lawyer, Rebecca Reitz, $90,000.00 - $100,000.00, for three to four months; her\n    third lawyer, Marcia Zimmerman, $40,000.00 - $50,000.00, for three months of work; her\n    fourth lawyer, Christopher Beck, some $23,000.00 for four months of work. Beck’s payment\n    took place even though the trial court (Judge C.G. Dibrell) had ordered Appellant not to\n    expend any more money on attorneys’ fees (id. at 158-161, lines 1-25; 162, lines 1-11).\n    Appellant feigned memory problems with regards to what she expended on previous lawyers\n\n                                                  7\n\f   prepared for that. If he would have billed me or even told me, “Hey, look,\n\n   you know, I’m going to need some more money,” or verbally or billed be,\n\n   which he said he would do according to his own contract, I would have\n\n   known. I would’ve been prepared. The reason for me showing up at his\n\n   office was to write him a check for $35,000. We’re done. That’s it.\n\n\n\n\nbut ultimately concede a figure ranging from $179,000.00 - $250,000.00 (RR, Vol. 5 at 57,\nlines 11-25; 58-65, lines 1-25; 66, lines 1-17). Trefethern brought Appellant to Appellee’s\noffice because the problems she was having in Judge Dibrell’s court and the belief the Judge,\nher spouse’s lawyer were personal friends - she felt she was not getting a fair shake (supra,\nRR, Vol. 6 at 157, lines 7-25). Appellant also expressed dissatisfaction with her current\nlawyers (Beck), contemplated filing suit against former counsel Reitz over her fee, and made\nit clear she had already hired an expert willing to testify against Reitz (Lillian Hardwick)\n(RR., Vol. 7 at 18, lines 8-23). Appellee represented Appellant for some 700 days (RR., Vol.\n7 at 10, lines 1-25).\n\nThe jury also heard the amount of fees Appellant had incurred and paid to her current trial\ncounsel, Christian, Smith & Jewell, LLP (RR., Vol. 11, at 72). Gary Jewell, an\nadministrative partner with the firm (id. at 74, lines 14-25), explained Appellant has incurred\nand paid $50,638.50 on matters outside of the divorce (id. at 83, lines 4-10 (identified these\nfees as matters started by Anthony Griffin in which his firm finalized). (id.) and $369,892.89\nfor work related to the dispute herein, Griffin v. Schlein, plus $27,541.06 in expenses (id. at\n84, lines 6-25; 85, lines 1-15). Albeit, Appellant’s counsel discounted their bill in front of\nthe jury to $260,000.00, the jury heard the sum did not include the fees being incurred during\nthe trial itself (id. at 87, lines 1-25; 88 lines 1-8). This amount did not include the $27,541.06\nsought in expenses (id.). This sum did not include any fees paid to local counsel, Stephen\nLewis, for his work and appearance at trial (id. at 119, lines 20-25; 120, lines 1-25; 125, lines\n18-25; 126-129, lines 1-25; 151, lines 14-25; 152, lines 1-25; 153-154, lines 1-25; 155, lines\n21-25; 156, lines 1-5).\n\nThus the fees paid to counsel, prior to Griffin’s hire, was between $174,000-194,000.00. The\namount paid to trial counsel, after Griffin terminated the relationship because of non-\npayment was minimally $370,000.00, not including $276,541.06 paid in expenses and an\nadditional sum unknown paid to local counsel. The jury ultimately rejected Appellant’s\nclaim for fees against Griffin and awarded Griffin his entire fees and costs incurred,\ndiscussed infra.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fRR., Vol. 4 at 113, lines 16-25.\n\n       Appellant accused Cross-Appellant of backdating his bill – the contract was\n\ndated August 5, 2011 (id. at 114, lines 11-20). Appellant contended she did not\n\nreceive the contract until four days after the divorce was final, which was October\n\n28th (id.).4 Appellant said when travelled to Cross-Appellant’s office to write the\n\ncheck for $35,000.00, she experienced a “bait and switch” by Cross-Appellant (id.\n\nat 115, lines 1-4). When asked what a bait and switch was, Appellant explained,\n\n“Well, you know, when you’re expecting to pay $35,000 - - which I don’t know\n\nabout you guys, but that’s a lot of money – that’s a ton of money for me being a\n\nsingle parent especially. [$] 111,000 was astronomically mind blowing. I just – I\n\nwas just shocked. I threw up. I had to go in his bathroom and throw up.” Id. at\n\n115, lines 5-11). Appellant then told the jury, “If the retainer exceeded $35,000, he\n\nwould have been billing me during the divorce process; and he didn’t do one single\n\nbill. So, how would I know” (id. at 116, lines 19-25; 117, line 1).5\n\n         Appellant admitted being required to paid $70,000.00, as interim attorney’s\n\nfee, to her husband’s lawyer (id. at 117, lines 2-23), in addition to $40,000.00 as\n\ntemporary support for her spouse (id.). The jury also heard these payments were\n\n\n4\n    Four days after October 28, 2011, for purposes this record, would be November 1st. Appellee\n    denied the assertion of backdating the bill, he testified the bill was mailed August 5, 2011\n    and was not backdated (RR., Vol. 7 at 24, lines 15-25; 25, lines 1-21).\n5\n    No language in the contract between the parties required monthly billing.\n\n                                               9\n\fbecause Appellant was accused in the underlying divorce of hiding and wasting\n\ncommunity assets (RR., Vol. 6 at 161, lines 9-25; 162, lines 1-11 (spending money\n\non lawyers after injunction by the trial court); 168, lines 1-25; 169, lines 1-4\n\n(attempt by spouse to appoint receiver to protect assets of the community estate,\n\nincluding separate funds in attempt); RR., Vol. 7 at 28, lines 17-25; 29-32, lines 1-\n\n25; 33, lines 1-7; 35, lines 14-25; 36, lines 1-11 (preparation for trial revelation\n\ndeletion from records, hiding funds, refusal to answer; issue of avoiding suborning\n\nperjury prior to trial).   The following additional exchange in reflective of the\n\ntestimony at trial:\n\n      [NORMA VENSO]\n\n      Q. Okay. I’m not asking you about that yet. While the case was pending\n\n           when Judge Dibrell ordered that you pay the interim attorney’s fees of\n\n           Mr. Schlein, did you ask your lawyer to take any action about that?\n\n      …\n\n      [BARBARA SCHLEIN]\n\n      A. Okay. I’m sorry, what is your question again?\n\n      Q. The question is: After Judge Dibrell had ordered you to pay your\n\n          husband’s lawyer while the case was still pending, did you ask Mr.\n\n          Griffin what could be done about that?\n\n      A. I don’t recall that conversation; and I don’t recall, you know, the divorce,\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f   like you said, lasted a few years. I don’t recall the time frame, dollar\n\n   amounts. That would be impossible. Remember, my divorce started in\n\n   2008. We’re almost in 2015. That as so many years ago, I don’t know.\n\nQ. Okay. Did you object to Anthony Griffin filing a mandamus in the Court\n\n   of Appeals appealing that ruling that you - - appealing it during the time\n\n   that the divorce was pending an extraordinary remedy, did you object to\n\n   him trying to get you a remedy for that in the Court of Appeals?\n\nA. I don’t recall. There was so much paperwork going on, I just don’t\n\n   remember.\n\nQ. So you don’t remember any mandamus being filed by Mr. Griffin and\n\n    whether – it’s just out of your mind?\n\nA. Part of it is I’m not an attorney and I don’t know all your legal jargon.\n\n   And if you said was there paperwork filed, I’d say, “Yeah, there was lots\n\n   of paperwork filed.” But what the paperwork that was filed was called,\n\n   I’m not a legal expert; and I’m not going to pretend to be; and I just\n\n   don’t know. I don’t know what he filed. He never had communication\n\n   with me so bottom line is: I could never get ahold of the man.\n\n             I never knew was going on. His status was horrible. No billing\n\n   statements ever, not one during the divorce. I might have had an inkling\n\n   of what was going on if I read it, so the answer is no.”\n\n\n                                   11\n\fId. at 119, lines 10-25; 120, lines 1-25; 121, lines 1-3.\n\n      Coupled with Appellant not remembering paperwork related to any\n\nmandamus, or any pleadings filed with the courts on her behalf (id. at 121, lines\n\n13-25; 122, lines 1-7), she summarily again informed the jury, “He never kept me\n\ninformed” (id. at 122, lines 7-23). Appellant testified Cross-Appellant kept her\n\nclient files, did not return the same (id. at 123, lines 1-5). The Court sustained\n\nCross-Appellant counsel’s objection. “I don’t recall getting much from him, if\n\nanything. I could get ahold of him on the phone let alone get anything from him” –\n\nwas the consistent tenor of Appellant’s testimony (id. at 123, lines 12-14).\n\n      When asked specifically how Cross-Appellant malpracticed her; Appellant\n\nset out a number of allegations:\n          \n              He fired me and he would not “give me client file back and I\n\n              absolutely was beside myself. Here I am fired. Now he wants – he’s\n\n              got a new billing statement for me. I have no attorneys. I have no\n\n              client file and my house is ready for foreclose on January 2 nd and\n\n              we’re hitting the holidays.”6\n\n\n   Id. at 132, lines 15-25; 133, lines 1-2 5; 134, lines 1-2 (further testimony that Appellee’s\n   failure to tender her file was the cause of the loss of the house in foreclosure). With regards\n   to the allegation of failure to return the client’s file, contrary testimony was also heard by the\n   jury, including the testimony of Rita Westerman, Linda Griffin, and Appellee.\n\n   Rita Westerman testified she was employed with Appellee for twenty-three years at the time\n   of the trial and remembered Appellant as a client of the office (RR., Vol. 6 at 139, lines 4-25;\n   140, lines 1-4). Westerman explained she was present in the office when Appellant came to\n\n                                                12\n\f           \n               That Cross-Appellant should have filed an insurance claim on her\n\n               house under construction at 1628 Enterprise (also same house which\n\n               was foreclosed on by the County. There was testimony the house was\n\n               hit by Hurricane Ike and uninsured at the time of the strike).7 When\n\n               asked whether she was blaming Cross-Appellant for the foreclosure,\n\n               Appellant ultimately explained, “I’m not placing blame, but I’m\n\n\n    retrieve her client files (id. at 143, lines 1-25; 144, lines 1-25 (“there could have been 30 or\n    40 boxes of files we had to give her back”).\n\n    Linda Griffin identified herself as a relative of Appellee (sister). Griffin testified she worked\n    part-time for Appellee and possessed a law degree, and prior to becoming a lawyer she\n    worked as a court reporter in federal court (id. at 123, lines 1-25). She also testified she\n    witnessed Schlein retrieve her files from the office (id. at 129, lines 8-25130, lines 1-16).\n\n    Appellee Griffin testified the file was returned after preparing the file for pickup (RR., Vol. 7\n    at 40, lines 10-25; 41, lines 1-25; 42, lines 1-21).\n7\n    Appellant argued that Appellee should have filed an insurance claim and identified the\n    insurance in effect at the time as Builder’s Risk Insurance (RR., Vol. 5 at 27, lines 11-25).\n    Appellant then postured she had “no idea if there was flood or wind. I wasn’t’ the builder so,\n    you know, he paid for the policy so how would I know that? I don’t know. That’s what I’m\n    saying. I don’t know what policies he had in effect at the time and that’s why Anthony got\n    this letter to find out, to subpoena them.” Id. at 41, lines 4-13. Appellant then admitted he\n    informed Appellant there builder failed to have wind and flood insurance during the\n    hurricane, “Most likely told him, but did I know? No. It’s, like I said, I most likely. I don’t\n    know. I wasn’t the builder.” Id. at 42, lines 6-10. Appellant also confirmed her previously\n    informing Appellant that the wind and flood insurance expired May 26, 2007 (prior to Ike’s\n    landing of September 2008) (id. at 43, lines 6-25; 44, lines 1-21; 45, lines 1-22).\n\n    Appellee explained that a lawsuit was brought against the builder for not having insurance,\n    per the client’s request. There was no wind and flood insurance at the time the Hurricane hit\n    and the Enterprise home suffered substantial damages (RR., Vol. 7 at 11, lines 9-25).\n    Appellee testified he initially learned there was no insurance from Appellant; he was\n    ultimately tendered documents affirming as much. Id. Appellee said notion of filing a claim\n    when no insurance was in existence did not make sense (id. at 12, lines 18-25; 13, lines 1-25;\n    14, line 1).\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                saying he contributed to issues at hand and he knows what those\n\n                issues are” (RR., Vol. 5 at 97, lines 16-25; 98, lines 1-25; 99, lines 1-\n\n                22).8 Appellant testified Cross-Appellant should be responsible to her\n\n                for the sum of $700,000.009 on this claim because “I felt like he\n\n                should have made a claim.” When counsel inquired whether this\n\n                meant the Builder’s Risk Insurance, Appellant answered in context of\n\n                a possible wish, “[o]n whatever insurance policies that he was going\n\n                to go get from the custodian of records at the insurance company” (id.\n\n                at 52, lines 11-25; 53, lines 1-11).10\n\n\n8\n     Later in her testimony, Appellant changed her testimony and contended Cross-Appellant\n     advised her not to pay the taxes on the house, “therefore, due to my lawyer’s advice, it did\n     foreclose” (RR., Vol. 6 at 13, lines 16-25; 14, lines 1-5). Appellant retreated from this\n     position when her documents revealed she requested Cross-Appellant to negotiate a payment\n     plan on the taxes, which Cross-Appellant accomplished (id. at 14, lines 18-25; 15, lines 1-25;\n     16, lines 1-25; 17, lines 1-24).\n9\n     When asked to quantify this sum, Appellant explained the sum would be the difference of\n     what she got at the foreclosure sale (received $760,000.00) of the property and the sum\n     $1,550,000. Appellant stood by the $1,550,000.00 even though her own appraiser valued the\n     property, at most, at $724,000.00 – all because of the uninsured storm damage (RR., Vol., 5\n     at 94, lines 9-25; 95, lines 1-25; 96, lines 1-18).\n\n     Appellant then tied herself in a proverbial knot, explaining, “if the builder negligence claim\n     had been made, which would make it $1,550,000.00 and you take the difference between that\n     number and the $760,000, that is a number that you should have been received for that house,\n     not the $760,000 dollar loss” (id. at 96, lines 13-25). Appellant admitted a builder’s\n     negligence lawsuit was filed, but said she didn’t consent to the filing of the claim (id. at 96,\n     lines 19-23), that he wants to hold Cross-Appellant Griffin liable for the builder’s negligence\n     (id. at 96, lines 24-25; 97, line 3), even though she testified she objected to him filing the\n     builder’s negligence lawsuit (id. at 97, lines 2-4).\n10\n     In trying to obtain a handle on the malpractice claim, Cross-Appellant’s counsel had the\n     following exchange with Appellant. The discussion related to a letter/email drafted by\n\n                                                 14\n\f            \n                That Cross-Appellant failed to keep her informed and undertook\n\n                actions willy-nilly. The notion Appellant was not kept informed took\n\n                the form of denying receiving any of the multitude of letters, emails,\n\n                etcetera, keeping her informed (RR., Vol. 5 at 115, lines 4-25; 116-\n\n\n\n   Appellant to Cross-Appellant.\n\n       [NORMA VENSO]\n\n       Q.

Yes.\n       Q.        “His language to you is highly condescending and controlling and offensive. Bill\n                makes you look bad to this judge ever[y] chance he gets. You should be offended\n                that Mr. De La Garza treats you with such disrespect and unprofessionalism.

All such exhibits were identified by Cross-Appellant as letters, emails and\n     documents directed to Appellant keeping her informed with regards to her case (RR., Vol. 8\n     at 14, lines 10-25; 15-31, lines 1-25; 32, lines 1-21). In addition, Plaintiff’s Exhibits 118-136\n     were admitted reflecting the same type of information (id. at 32, lines 22-25; 33-42, lines 1-\n     25; 43, lines 1-9).\n\n     Cross-Appellant testified the Appellant was not dissatisfied with his services and that the\n     dispute arose when he refused her offer of her tile and a reduction of his fees and costs. Prior\n     to coming into his office in October, Appellant had drafted a document apologizing for\n     Cross-Appellant not being paid. The document reads in part:\n\n                “I’m sorry you haven’t been paid. I thank God every day that you and your staff\n                have stayed with Austin and I. You are obviously passionate about your job.\n                Now I know why people say really good things about you that they do. I wish\n                everyone could read this e-mail and see things how they really are in this case.\n                The Court is bankrupting us, even though I have separate property money to live\n                on.”\n\n     Id. at 46, lines 2-125; 47, lines 1-18; see email at RR., Vol. 15, Plaintiff’s Exhibit 83.\n\n     Cross-Appellant testified Appellant prevailed in the divorce. The community assets were\n     split 50/50%, with Appellant received the community home (her request to the Court), with a\n     reimbursement order to her spouse of $371,000 (approximately $150,000 less than his share\n     contributed to house) (RR., Vol. 7 at 34, lines 12-22). Albeit the jury found against Appellant\n     her cruelty, adultery and abuse claims (id. at 34, lines 20-25; 35, lines 1-10), the 50/50% split\n     and awarding of home to Appellant still took place. In addition, Appellant was able to avoid\n     the payment of attorneys fee to the opposing lawyer ($450,000 claim), reimbursement to her\n     former spouse, contribution to the community estate ($400,000 claim), and avoiding the\n     claim of her having possession of his separate property ($300,000 claim) (RR., Vol. 6, 171,\n     24-25; 172, lines 1-10). Appellant also received her separate property funds ($600,000 -\n     $800,000.00) (id. at 172, lines 15-25). Appellant expressed happiness with the trial, but\n     disappointment with her not receiving funds on the civil tort portions of the verdict in the\n     divorce. Appellant was also happy she received the Enterprise home, in that it is something\n     she requested of the trial court (id. at 173, lines 1-25; 174, lines 1-25; 175, lines 1-25).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\f      Appellant   also   contended    Cross-Appellant    breached    his   fiduciary\n\nresponsibility to her by revealing things she told him in confidence (RR., Vol. 6 at\n\n6, lines 9-13). This claim related to Appellant’s contention that Cross-Appellant\n\nplaced in his original pleadings filed with the Court matters she contends should\n\nhave been confidential conversations – even though in the same breath she\n\ncontends the confidential conversation never took place (id. at 6, lines 14-25; 7,\n\nlines 1-25). Appellant also contended Cross-Appellant defamed her by placing\n\ninformation in the lawsuit claiming she had taken and hidden evidence from the\n\nother side in the divorce proceeding - Appellant contended this too as an event\n\nnever occurred. Id.\n\n      Appellant admitted Cross-Appellant never tried to bill her for any of the\n\nother work he performed for her (RR., Vol. 6, at 30, lines 13-20). And with\n\nregards to the allegation by Appellant she paid Cross-Appellant in property,\n\nAppellant contended the tile was worth $57,000 and “he had kept it and he’s only\n\ndue and owing $35,000. So the difference is almost $22,000 that he owes me” (id.\n\nat 33, lines 10-17). Appellant admitted she paid $20,301.88 for the tile (id. at 36,\n\nlines 1-18).\n\n      The jury heard testimony that the valuation of the tile also ultimately was\n\nproblematic.   The tile’s value was tendered by a Paulette Varner.           Varner\n\nidentified herself as an interior designer by profession.     Varner testified she\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\fattended South Dakota State University in interior design and ultimately finished\n\nher degree in interior design at North Dakota State University [sic] (RR., Vol. 11 at\n\n42, lines 8-25; 43, lines 1-5). Varner is the owner of Vstudios, located in the\n\nWoodlands area (id. at 43, lines 19-21). She described the tile as venato, from\n\nPeru (id. at 46, lines 7-25; 47, lines 1-19). Varner appraised the tile at $56,338.85\n\n(id. at 52, lines 11-13; see report at Defendant’s Exhibit 7); testifying the tile has\n\nappreciated in value (id. at 55, lines 14-25; 56, lines 1-19), because of its rare\n\nnature (id.). When asked about a sample tile labeled Defendant’s Exhibit 82,\n\nVarner testified she didn’t know where the tile came from, only it was given to her\n\nby Schlein and her lawyers (id. at 59, lines 13-25). It was her assumption the tile\n\nwas taken from the Schlein home prior to the tile going to the warehouse (id. at 60,\n\nlines 1-6). When presented with Plaintiff’s Exhibit 150, a tile from the warehouse,\n\nVarner stated the tile was not vernato (id. at 60, lines 7-25). The jury also heard,\n\nthe other products/items ordered for the Enterprise home ended up being\n\nfraudulent/fake (concrete pilings or columns instead of the travertine columns\n\nbeing delivered) (id. at 62, lines 8-25; 63, lines 1-19).\n\n      Varner’s resume reflected she possessed a master’s of architecture from the\n\nUniversity of Texas; she said he as a student in 1981, 1982 (id. at 58, lines 9-11). .\n\nShe testified it took her a year and a half to complete the degree (id. at 57, lines 2-\n\n18) and that the degree was obtained in her maiden name, Ellington. Id. Varner\n\n\n                                           18\n\fstated she is not a license architect, “I passed every section except for structures the\n\nfirst time, and the structures portion I took five times and just didn’t pass it” (id. at\n\n58, lines 1-8). After Varner’s credential were checked, it was determined she\n\nnever attended the University of Texas (see Plaintiff’s Exhibit 153; RR., Vol. 12 at\n\n117, lines 18-25; 118, lines 1-25; 119, lines 1-22). The witness’ bold face\n\nmisstatement of her qualifications is something the jury was free to consider.\n\n        To support her claims against Cross-Appellant, Appellant called Lillian\n\nHardwick.       Hardwick testified she has co-authored a treatise on attorney judicial\n\nethics in 2002 (RR., Vol. 10 at 120, lines 6-25; 121, 1-4). Hardwick explained she\n\nis also involved presenting at continuing legal education courses, participation in\n\nState Bar Committees (id. at 121, lines 1-25) and advising lawyers or law firms on\n\nthe disciplinary rules (id. at 122, lines 2-12).\n\n        Hardwick stated she was hired by Appellant to figure out which of the\n\nattorney’s fiduciary duties might have been violated by Cross-Appellant (id. at\n\n122, lines 13-20). Hardwick expressed a view Cross-Appellant violated his duty of\n\nloyalty,12 candor, and confidentiality13 (id. at 123, lines 9-21). In this context,\n\n\n12\n     With regards to the duty of loyalty, the witness explained as follows:\n\n        My opinion is that he breached the duty of loyalty in that this agreement, whether taken\n        individually or together, is unconscionable in that it is overreaching and not clear; and\n        that is at the outset of the relationship, the lawyer, of course, knows much more about\n        what’s going on and what will be going on than the client does. So it’s the lawyer’s\n        obligation to set out what’s going to happen and particularly how the lawyer is going to\n        be paid in a way that is clear to the client” (id. at 126, lines 1-16).\n\n                                                19\n\fHardwick express a view the sending of only one invoice constituted a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty (id. at 132, lines 5-25), a view that nothing in the contract allowed\n\nfor Cross-Appellant to bill for copy cost (id. at 133, lines 7-23; 134, line 1 (breach\n\nof fiduciary duty to not disclose and then charge for it) ). Hardwick also criticized\n\nCross-Appellant saying he breached the duty of confidentiality (id. at 137, lines 7-\n\n25). This opinion related to the Appellant’s contention her file was not turned over\n\nto her and the retention of the tile (id. at 137, lines 8-25; 138, lines 1-23). At no\n\npoint did Appellant submit a question to the jury as to who owned the tile.\n\n        On cross examination, Hardwick affirmed she had previously been hired by\n\nSchlein in the Reitz representation of Schlein (id. at 141, lines 7-25). Hardwick\n\ntestified she never talked to Schlein, only to her lawyers and documents provided\n\n\n\n     Hardwick explained her problem with the agreement related to the language identifying\n     stating “all matters concerning this divorce,” whether they were civil issues, tort issues,\n     whatever (id. at 127, lines 2-17). Hardwick expressed the opinion that “it gives the lawyer an\n     opportunity later on to do exactly what I said, to interpret it to his or her advantage down the\n     road (id. at 127, lines 21-25).\n\n     Cross-Appellant testified his bill was segregated and the only matter billed was the divorce\n     matter and all other matters performed by Cross-Appellant were not billed (RR., Vol. 8 at 61,\n     lines 22-25; 62-64, lines 1-25). Even in this context, Appellant’s counsel incorrectly held out\n     to the expert, “Mr. Griffin has testified that there is no limit as to what his fees might be that\n     Ms. Schlein has to pay under this agreement” (id. at 129, lines 18-25; 130, 1-4). The expert\n     then responded “Yes, because by no means do I think this agreement communicates that. So\n     if that’s what he intended to communicate, then he has breached the duty of communication,\n     as well as created an overreaching or unconscionable agreement that does not clearly convey\n     that at the outset.” Id.\n13\n     This was explained as “Mr. Griffin revealed in a pleading, which is public things that Ms.\n     Schlein told him in attorney-client communications; and they are set out there now for all the\n     world to see” (id. at 159, lines 10-15).\n\n                                                  20\n\fby the lawyers (id. 142, lines 1-25). “We talked about what I would testify which\n\nis breach of fiduciary duty” (id. at 142, lines 19-24). Hardwick admitted never\n\nsitting first chair at trial, never handling a divorce, and never having done free\n\nlegal work for someone under order not to spend any more money on attorney’s\n\nfee (id. at 143, lines 20-25; 144, lines 1-4).        The witness admitted she was\n\nexpressing an opinion with regards to Cross-Appellant’s standard of care in a\n\npractice-specific area of divorce, “I am not a divorce lawyer; and I’m not here to\n\ntestify about the standard of care or to give it for you” (id. at 146, lines 2-13).\n\n      When asked about the home not having insurance, Hardwick stated she\n\nrecalled the discussion, “I’m not sure that I know the difference between them” (id.\n\nat 147, lines 12-25; 148, lines 1-6). When asked whether Cross-Appellant violated\n\nhis duty by failing to file a builder’s risk claim on behalf of Ms. Schlein, the\n\nwitness backed away again, “Whatever he did or did not do, I’m saying it was his\n\nduty to explain to her what he was doing and why he was doing it or why he was\n\nnot doing it” (id. at 148, lines 9-21). The expert however is clear in imposing on\n\nCross-Appellant a standard of requiring him to pursue the charges and objectives\n\nor Appellant, or an explanation of why not (id. at 149, lines 10-25; 150, lines 1-2).\n\n      [NORMA VENSO]\n\n      Q.     But if she did get an explanation, then there was no breach of\n\n              fiduciary duty?\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\f       [LILLIAN HARDWICK]\n\n       A.

She expressed no opinion on the\n\nemail from Schlein expressing satisfaction with Griffin’s work and Schlein regrets\n\nGriffin had not been paid (id. at 154, lines 1-6), nor the work performed by Griffin\n\nwith regards to her taxes and working out an arrangement (id. at 154, lines 7-13).\n\nHardwick also expressed no opinion whether there was wind or flood insurance\n\n(id. at 155, lines 1-4).\n\n       [NORMA VENSO]\n\n       Q. So you’re not here saying there was a viable insurance claim. You’re\n\n            just saying that if what the other side tells you is true, that Mr. Griffin\n\n            didn’t explain to her enough of why an insurance claim wasn’t file?\n\n       [LILLIAN HARDWICK]\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. And you’re calling that a breach of fiduciary duty?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. The failure to explain.\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f        A. Yes, it’s the breach of duty of loyalty and of communication.\n\n        Q. Would you agree with me that in a legal malpractice claim, it is the\n\n            burden to prove that there would have been a different result but for the\n\n            negligence of the lawyer?\n\n        A. It depends on how you define legal malpractice. I think you’re talking\n\n            about negligence cases.\n\n\n        Q. Yes, I am.\n\n        A. I’m here testifying about breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nId. at 156, lines 4-25.\n\n        There was a series of witnesses who were called by Cross-Appellant after\n\nhis character was moved into evidence, over objection.14 Those witnesses included\n\n\n\n\n14\n        During Cross-Appellant’s testimony, the Court allowed Appellant to inquire of Cros-\n     Appellant sanctions by State Bar of Texas, regarding client complaints. With respect to a\n     client named Guzman (RR., Vol. 10, at 55, lines 15-25; 56, lines 1-25; 57, lines 1-25\n     (testimony entered in agreement with State Bar on sanction, probated suspension). Likewise\n     in matter involving a client named Cusick, Cross-Appellant agreed to a public reprimand,\n     voluntarily sent a letter of apology to Mr. Cusick (id. at 59, lines 7-25; 60, lines 1-25; 61,\n     lines 10-24). And finally, in regards to a client named Vereen, a judgment of public\n     reprimand for neglecting the client’s matter (id. at 61, lines 23-25; 62, lines 1-25; 63, lines 1-\n     25). Cross-Appellant explained his office was affected by Hurricane Ike, receiving 4 to 5\n     feet of water, destroying one-half of open and pending files (lost or destroy) (id. at 68, lines\n     13-25; 69, lines 1-15). With regards to large litigation files., stored in a warehouse, the\n     warehouse received eight (8) feet of water, with the destruction of one-half of those files\n     destroyed (id.).\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fMichael Landolt,15 Helen Truscott,16 Mary Luna,17 Joanna Mora,18 and Lloyd\n\nGilliam.19\n\n\n\n\n15\n      Landolt explained he is a current client of Cross-Appellant. Landolt is a wealth financial\n     manager by profession, his wife the owner of an Anheuser-Busch distributor (RR., Vol. 162,\n     lines 14-25). Landolt stated Cross-Appellant represents he and his wife in a suit against their\n     homeowner’s association. Landolt testified he was kept well-informed by Griffin and had no\n     problem finding out about his case (id. 10 at 162, lines 14-25; 163, lines 1-22). Landolt paid\n     an initial retainer of $15,000.00 and ultimately a fee of $70,000.00 (id. at 163, lines 22-25;\n     164, lines 1-11).\n16\n     Truscott identified herself as a practicing attorney, having been licensed since November,\n     1980 (RR., Vol. 11 at 7, lines 19-25).

Mora hired Griffin\n     because of his reputation and after her mother read an article in Texas Monthly (RR., Vol. 11\n     at 154, lines 22-25; 16, lines 1-11). Mora hired Cross-Appellant in a divorce matter, after he\n     explained he was not a family lawyer (id. at 16, lines 11-19). Griffin explained he could\n     refer her to other lawyer, but she decided to hire because of her husband being in law\n     enforcement (id. at 16, lines 15-25; 17, lines 1-25). She, Mora, too testified with regards to\n     Cross-Appellant’s character (kept informed and reliable) (id. at 18, lines 10-21).\n19\n       Lloyd Gilliam identified himself as a current client of Cross-Appellant.

He testified that divorces were not a routine part of his\n\npractice, an election he made because, “[t]hey’re emotionally too hard (id. at 83,\n\nlines 4-25; 84, line 1; 84, lines 13-25).\n\n      Cross-Appellant billed at $300.00 an hour at 352.5 hours, for a bill in the\n\namount of $105,750.00. The copy costs was $18,000.00, the expenses on behalf of\n\n\n                                            25\n\fthe client was $4,399.29 for a total of $128,149.29 (id. at 85, lines 14-25; 86, lines\n\n1-6).\n\n        Genevieve McGarvey, a licensed lawyer, testified on behalf of Cross-\n\nAppellant.

McGarvey\n\nexpressed the view the hourly rate and fee of Cross-Appellant was reasonable and\n\nnecessary (id. at 100, lines 11-25; 101, lines 1-25; 102, lines 17-25; 103, lines 1-\n\n18).    On cross-examination she reaffirmed her view of Cross-Appellant’s good\n\ncharacter of Cross-Appellant (id. at 1054, lines 10-18; 106, lines 1-25; 107, lines 1-\n\n25) (expressing the same view even in light of the recent adverse events).\n\n        The last witness who testified in Cross-Appellant’s case-in-chief was his\n\ncounsel, Norma Venso. Venso identified herself as being licensed February 1978,\n\n\n                                           26\n\fafter graduating from the University of Texas Law School in December 1977 (RR.,\n\nVol. 10 at 110, lines 17-25). Venso served as a trial lawyer for 17 years prior to\n\nbeing elected to the 56th Judicial District Court, Galveston County, Texas (id.).\n\nShe served as a judge from 1997 to 2004 (id. at 111, lines 1-4).\n\n       Venso’s rate charged was $425.00 an hour.                She testified the fee was\n\nreasonable and necessary in the Houston Galveston legal market (id. at 111, lines\n\n5-13). Her hours billed was 29.5 hours for fees in the amount of $29,962.50\n\n(testifying she cut her hours half). She continued to explain, “The hundred hours\n\nthat had been in my report, the first hundred hours have been reduced to 70.5 and\n\nso adding to that another 69.5; and by the way, we estimated the trial work to be 40\n\nhours, which is way less than what it’s actually turned out to be; but that comes up\n\nto a total of $59,500.00 (id. at 112, lines 6-24).\n\n       The trial court granted Cross-Appellant’s requested dismissal on the claim\n\ndirected at the defamation claim (RR., Vol. 12 at 104, line 25; 105-109, lines 1-25;\n\n110, lines 1-16). After the charge conference, the Appellant elected not to submit\n\nany questions on the malpractice allegations (RR., Vol. 12 at 103, line 25; 104, line\n\n1-25).

GRIFFIN, ORIGINAL PETITION\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:\n\n         This lawsuit is brought to collect on outstanding debts due\n\nand owing to Anthony P. Griffin, hereinafter and sometimes\n\nreferred to as Plaintiff, with regards to services rendered to\n\nBarbara Regina Schlein, hereinafter and sometimes referred to as\n\nDefendant.      Plaintiff would show unto the Court as follows, to-\n\nwit:\n\n                                   I.\n\n         This is a Schedule 2 matter and as such it is requested\n\nthat the Court establish a scheduling order herein.\n\n                                   II.\n\n         At all times material to this action,       Plaintiff is a\n\nlicensed lawyer in the State of Texas engaged in the practice of\n\nlaw.\n\n         Defendant, Barbara Schlein, can be served with process by\n\nserving her at 2106 Pleasant Palm Circle, League City, Texas\n\n77573.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      000010\n                     Cross-Appellant's Appendix10\n\f000011\n\n\n\n\n         All matters material to this action occurred in Galveston\n\nand/or Harris County, Texas.\n\n                                    III.\n\n                 Breach of Contract Claim -     Family Claim\n\n         In November 3, 2009,   Plaintiff entered a contract of\n\nemployment with Plaintiff.       The contract called for the\n\nDefendant to pay to Plaintiff an initial retainer of $35,000.00\n\nand for counsel to be paid a reduced hourly rate of $250.00 an\n\nhour for any work over $35,000.00.         The contract was entered\n\nwith knowledge of previous counsel's representation of the\n\nDefendant and the long-term and protracted nature of the\n\nunderlying family/business law litigation. 1         Even though\n\nreferenced in the contract, the Defendant never paid the initial\n\nretainer of $35,000.00, but explained to Plaintiff that she was\n\ntrustworthy, that she always paid her bills and that if the\n\nPlaintiff took care of her interest, she would take care of him.\n\nPlaintiff explained that she simply had to abide with the terms\n\nof the contract.\n\n         Plaintiff represented Defendant in the family litigation\n\nand maintained business records during the course of the\n\nrepresentation.      At the end of the representation,       Plaintiff\n\n\n\n1\n  In the Matter of the Marriage of Barbara Regina Schlein and Robert John\nSchlein; Case No. 08FD2371; in the County Court at Law, No. 2, Galveston,\nCounty, Texas.\n                                      2\n\n\n\n                                                                            000011\n                     Cross-Appellant's Appendix11\n\f000012\n\n\n\n\nforwarded a bill setting out the total amount of time expended\n\non Plaintiff's behalf was 352.50 hours for a total of\n\n$88,125.00.         Plaintiff's office also incurred some $22,339.29 in\n\ncosts.         The total attorneys'   fee and costs incurred on behalf of\n\nthe client and due and owing is $110,524.29.\n\n         Plaintiff sues for this amount and prays for judgment.\n\n                                         IV.\n\n                       Additional Work -       Quantum Meruit\n\n         Plaintiff also engaged in other work for Defendant that was\n\nexternal to the contract of employment surrounding the family\n\nlitigation.         The agreement of representation was based upon\n\ntrust and promises that Defendant was \"honest, trustworthy and a\n\nChristian woman and that she paid her bills\" (Defendant's\n\nwords).         Plaintiff was informed by Defendant on multiple\n\noccasions that if her money in the family case was cleared up\n\nshe would immediately get Plaintiff paid - \"trust me.\"               The\n\nworked performed on Defendant's behalf included the following:\n\n         i)      Civil litigation over debt in Justice Court       (Bank of\n\n                America v. Barbara and Robert Schlein) -        the defense\n\n                was successful;\n\n         ii)     Criminal litigation in criminal case       (State of Texas\n\n                 v.

Centre Builders, et al.;       in the\n\n                lOth Judicial District Court; Galveston County, Texas);\n\n         vii)   Representation of Barbara Schlein in litigation in\n\n                real estate litigation and lien placed on community\n\n                property (Barbara Schlein v. Robert Schlein and Bill\n\n                De La Garza,   et al.,   in the 212th Judicial District\n\n                Court; Galveston County, Texas).\n\n         The reasonable value of the subject work is sixty\n\n\n                                          4\n\n\n                                                                            000013\n                       Cross-Appellant's Appendix13\n\f000014\n\n\n\n\nthousand ($60,000.00) dollars; this amount does not include the\n\ncontingent fee in existence in the building negligence matter\n\npending in Galveston County.      Plaintiff sues for his reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney's fees and costs incurred on behalf of\n\nPlaintiff in these cases     ($15,000.00 in costs).    Plaintiff seeks\n\na declaratory judgment with respect to the contingent fee\n\ncontract on the construction litigation that the contract is a\n\nvalid and enforceable contract and remains in effects.\n\n                                   v.\n                            Unjust Enrichment\n\n         Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above information\n\nfor all purposes.      In addition and/or in the alternative to the\n\nforegoing,     Plaintiff would show that it is entitled to recover\n\nunder the doctrine of unjust enrichment.        According to this\n\nequitable principle of justice, equity, and/or good conscience,\n\nPlaintiff is entitled to recover for the products, materials,\n\nand services that Defendant received and benefited from without\n\ncompensating Plaintiff.      Under the theory of unjust enrichment,\n\nPlaintiff is entitled to recover all actual damages, together\n\nwith attorneys'     fees and costs of Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\n\n\n                                                                    000014\n                     Cross-Appellant's Appendix14\n\f000015\n\n\n\n\n                                    VI.\n\n                             Fraud Allegations\n\n         Plaintiff brings suit on the basis of fraud.   It is\n\nPlaintiff's contention that Defendant has defrauded both him and\n\nthe court during the course of the contractual relationship.\n\nPlaintiff signed a contract imposing an obligation on the client\n\nto be honest in her dealings with the Plaintiff and the court.\n\nThe applicable language under the contract reads as follows:\n\n                   Withdrawal, Malfeasance, Breach of Contract\n         1.   Withdrawal:  Lawyers have an ethical obligation to\n              represent the Client zealously within the bounds of the\n              law, but the Lawyers also have an obligation, when\n              material representation surfaces or where there is a\n              breach of the terms of this contract by the Client, to\n              withdraw from the representation of the Client.\n              Nothing in this contract guarantees any results,\n              including whether a suit will or will not be filed or\n              any other matters that border on guarantees.   The only\n              guarantee relates to the representation within the\n              confines of the Code of Professional Responsibility\n              (zealously within the bounds of the law).   It has been\n              explained orally that the Lawyers' obligation to the\n              Court and the rules of ethics require investigation and\n              examination of the facts.\n         2.   Investigation/If No Case:   If the facts reveal no case\n              exists, the Lawyer shall promptly advise the client and\n              terminate the relationship.   The retainer again is non-\n              refundable.\n\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\n\n                                                                   000015\n                      Cross-Appellant's Appendix15\n\f000016\n\n\n\n\n         3.   Investigation/Material Breach:  If the\n              investigation reveals a material breach, lie, or\n              misstatement by the client, the Lawyer will advise\n              the Client as to how such breach affects the\n              Lawyer's ability to proceed in the representation.\n              If termination is appropriate, the Lawyer(s) shall\n              advise the client of her rights and shall promptly\n              take any necessary acts to protect the Client\n              (advise as to action) and the firm's rights.\n              Again, the retainer shall be deemed non-\n              refundable.\n\n\n    Prior to the signing of the contract, the contract was\n\n    explained to the client and Plaintiff relied upon\n\n    Defendant's statements with regard to telling the truth, be\n\n    forthright and honest and not to conceal any information\n\n    during the process.        Defendant affirmed her understanding\n\n    and held out that she would remain honest and that she\n\n    would not conceal information from Plaintiff and/or from\n\n    the Court.        However, during the course of the relationship,\n\n    Defendants actions revealed fraud that struck at the\n\n    fundamental relationship between the parties.        These\n\n    actions included the following:\n\n                 1)      Requesting to see banking records before the\n\n                         lawyer after banking records were tendered\n\n                        by the banking entity.   After the lawyer\n\n                         learned that the client had gone through the\n\n                         records prior to his review, copying and\n\n                         tendering to the other side, he prohibited\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n                                                                        000016\n                         Cross-Appellant's Appendix16\n\f000017\n\n\n\n\n              the client's access to any such documents\n\n              until after the lawyer touched the documents\n\n              first;\n\n         2)   In preparation for trial, the lawyer\n\n              discovered a discrepancy in checks and the\n\n              financial records and inquired of the\n\n              client.    In the discussion, the lawyer\n\n              became angry and stated that \"if I was the\n\n              judge, I would put you in jail.\"    The\n\n              Defendant, instead of addressing the\n\n              problem/discrepancy the client engaged in\n\n              tears and continued to repeat .... \"I don't\n\n              know.\"    When the contradiction was revealed\n\n              in the examination, the client simply\n\n              stated, \"I just have to go to jail.\"       The\n\n              client was instructed that if the question\n\n              was asked at a trial or hearing, Defendant\n\n              had to answer honestly, even if it meant not\n\n              answering and/or repeating her statement, \"I\n\n              just have to go to jail.\"    The question was\n\n              not asked at trial;\n\n         3)   The client held out to Plaintiff that his\n\n              fees would be paid.    \"I have the money, I\n\n              will pay you.    You trust me don't you?\"\n\n\n\n                              8\n                                                               000017\n              Cross-Appellant's Appendix17\n\f000018\n\n\n\n\n              Defendant explained that when the process\n\n              was over she would immediately get a check\n\n              issued to pay Plaintiff.   Plaintiff relied\n\n              on these statements.\n\n         4)   After the presentation of the bill,\n\n              Plaintiff explained in the bill and orally\n\n              that he would discount the bill   (fees and\n\n              costs), in order to make it better on the\n\n              client and in order to receive compensation.\n\n              On or about October 28, 2011,   Plaintiff was\n\n              informed by Defendant that she would not and\n\n              could not pay Plaintiff's fees.    Plaintiff\n\n              had been informed that she had worked with\n\n              her financial advisor, Ritchie Faulk to\n\n              protect her funds from collection.    In the\n\n              conversation of October 28, 2011, Defendant\n\n              said the funds were placed in an IRA and\n\n              that she could not remove the same until she\n\n              was 59.   Presumably, Defendant wanted\n\n              Plaintiff to wait until a period of in\n\n              excess of ten (10) years for compensation.\n\n              The Defendant's statement was related to the\n\n              IRA is inconsistent with Defendant holding\n\n              out that after taking out \"your\" lawyer's\n\n\n\n                             9\n                                                              000018\n              Cross-Appellant's Appendix18\n\f000019\n\n\n\n\n                           fees,   I will place my other funds in a\n\n                          protective status.

See Contractual Agreement (hereinafter \"Contractual Agreement,\" attached as Exhibit\n\nA). The Contractual Agreement provides for a $35,000 retainer fee to be paid by Schlein, subject\n\nto an understanding that there was a court order which prevented Schlein from expending funds\n\nwithout approval of the court. Ex. A. The Contractual Agreement further provides that the retainer\n\nis \"non-refundable\" and that \"once the fee is paid, it shall be deemed earned.\" Ex. A.\n\n         2.2    Griffin supplemented the Contractual Agreement by providing Schlein with an\n\nExplanation of Contract and Letter Agreement (hereinafter \"Letter Agreement,\" attached as Exhibit\n\nB.

Schlein fully performed her duties under the Contractual Agreement and Letter\n\nAgreement. Griffin failed to perform his duties and breached the Contractual Agreement and Letter\n\nAgreement. Griffin's breach proximately caused Schlein's injury. As a result, Schlein seeks to\n\nrecover actual damages, benefit of the bargain damages, and reliance damages.\n\n                                      LEGAL MALPRACTICE\n\n         4 .I     All proceeding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference.

Schlein relied on these representations and entered\n\ninto the Contractual and Letter Agreements with Griffin, and as a result she was injured. As a result,\n\nSchlein seeks to recover actual damages, benefit of the bargain damages, attorney's fees and reliance\n\ndamages.\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT'S AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM                                               PAGE 4 OF 6\n                                                                                                  000029\n                            Cross-Appellant's Appendix26\n\f000030\n\n\n\n\n                            FRAUD FOR FAILURE TO DISCLOSE\n\n         7 .I   All proceeding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference.
