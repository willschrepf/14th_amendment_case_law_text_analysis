We affirm.\n\f                                         Factual History\n\n       AISD maintains its own police force. In 2004, AISD hired Perry to join\nAISD’s police force as “gang officer” to address gang-related activity in AISD\nschools.1 In mid-2005, Turner, then captain of the police force,2 allegedly was\napproached by “more than one” AISD campus principals who expressed concern\nover “the way [Perry] dealt with students.”3 Appellants assert that these incidents\nwere “part of a pattern of problems caused by Perry’s behavior,” including\nallegedly referring to students as “ghetto kids,” “escalating situations with\nstudents,” “acting inappropriately with students,” “violating all sorts of\n[departmental] procedures,” and failing to seek permission from a supervisor\nbefore contacting the district attorney to bring charges against a student.\nAppellants allege that Turner and Bonaparte, who was at the time a sergeant acting\nas Perry’s supervisor,4 had numerous conversations with Perry about these issues.\nPerry denies the allegations.\n\n       Perry alleges that in late 2004, he met with the mayor’s anti-gang task force\nrepresentative, who had heard a rumor of a planned May 5th nationwide gang war\nthat would involve Houston gang members.                       Perry sent an email to gang\n\n       1\n           Perry previously had been a Harris County deputy sheriff.\n       2\n           By the time of trial, Turner had been promoted to chief of the police force.\n       3\n          One principal was concerned about “the rough temperament that . . . Perry use[d] when\nhe [was] interviewing students or talking to students.” Allegedly, Perry was involved in a\nconfrontation with a student and the student’s parent, who were both apparently arrested. Turner\ntestified, “Perry intervened with a student and it became confrontational and the student was\narrested and, if I’m not mistaken, so was the student[’s] parent.” Turner did not know the names\nof the student or parent. Turner could not remember if Perry’s actions with regard to this\nincident were investigated.\n        Another principal was concerned with “the way that . . . Perry . . . interacts with students”\nand allegedly asked Turner “to keep him off of her campus.” Turner did not know what incident\nthat principal was referring to.\n       4\n           By the time of trial, Bonaparte had been promoted to captain of the police force.\n\n                                                  2\n\finvestigators both inside and outside of AISD warning them about this possible\nevent.5 Perry asserts that an anti-gang liaison with the Texas Attorney General’s\nOffice contacted him in response to the email and asked, “Do you mind if I post\nthis on CLEO?”6 According to Perry, “[I]t’s obviously in the best interest of law\nenforcement agencies to have every avenue of information that they could, so I\nsaid yes.” Perry asserts that Bonaparte told him “the superintendent had been\nreceiving lots of phone calls [because of the CLEO posting],” “was upset because\nthis information had gotten outside of the district,” and “the district was\nembarrassed.” Bonaparte also told Perry, “in the past[,] previous gang officers had\n[interacted with the community to address gang problems] and . . . that tended to\nlower the property values in the area,” which AISD did not like. On May 4,\nBonaparte sent Perry a written notice stating he was not to disseminate information\nregarding “activities in and around this district . . . without prior written approval\nfrom [the] departmental supervisor.”\n\n       On June 13, Perry received an annual performance evaluation indicating his\nperformance “m[et] expectations.” Later that month, after he issued a traffic ticket\nto an AISD teacher, Bonaparte and Turner removed the ticket from the citation\nbook in Perry’s office.7 Approximately two weeks later, Turner put Perry on a\ndisciplinary “Growth Plan,” which appellants allege was intended to help Perry\n“identify and improve his performance problems” listed on the plan as “[a]reas of\nidentified weakness,” including (1) failing to follow the chain of command;\n(2) inappropriate attitude and demeanor; (3) failing to follow patrol protocol such\n\n       5\n           Turner and Bonaparte were copied on the email.\n       6\n         CLEO, which stands for “Criminal Law Enforcement Online,” is an information-\nsharing database maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. It is accessible only by\nlaw enforcement personnel.\n       7\n           Appellants do not dispute this fact.\n\n                                                  3\n\fas responding to calls and requests for backup; and (4) spending excessive time in\nthe office. At the same time, Perry was demoted from gang officer to patrol officer\nand lost a weekend day off. Perry asserts during a meeting to discuss the plan,\nBonaparte admitted he took the traffic ticket out of Perry’s office because the\nteacher Perry had ticketed was a friend of Turner’s and “politically connected.”\n\n      On July 25, 2005, Perry filed a grievance8 complaining about his\nreassignment, alleging it was the result, in part, of his ticketing the teacher. The\ngrievance also states that Bonaparte admitted removing the ticket from Perry’s\ncitation book. On September 13, 2005, a hearing on Perry’s grievance was held.\nBonaparte signed the decision denying relief. Perry filed his Level Two grievance\non October 11, 2005. Perry filed a Level Three grievance on November 2, 2005\nbecause neither the superintendent nor his designee met with Perry before the\nrequired deadline. No further action was taken on this grievance.\n\n      On October 18, 2005, Perry filed a formal complaint with the district\nattorney reporting the destruction of the traffic ticket by Bonaparte and Turner.\nPerry alleges he hand-delivered a new Level Two grievance to the AISD’s\n\n\n      8\n          AISD has a four-step process for an employee to pursue a grievance:\n            1. The employee and his immediate supervisor meet for an informal conference.\n            2. If the employee is dissatisfied, he may “file” a Level One grievance with his\n               supervisor. A Level One conference is then held between the “appropriate\n               administrator” and the employee, after which the administrator must provide the\n               employee with a written response.\n            3. The employee may appeal the response by filing a Level Two grievance. The\n               superintendent then must conduct a conference with the employee and\n               subsequently provide a written response to the Level Two grievance.\n            4. The employee may appeal by filing a Level Three grievance, which is submitted\n               to the Board of Trustees. Then, the Board determines whether the grievance\n               merits a hearing. If so, the Board may make its determination orally or in writing.\n               The lack of a response by the Board by the end of its next meeting upholds the\n               Level Two decision.\n\n                                                4\n\fsuperintendent’s office on October 27, 2005, with the heading “Level II grievance\nRetaliation/Whistleblower.” The grievance states,\n\n       Due to the recent grievance filed by Officer Perry, reference [sic]\n       inappropriate disciplinary action and illegal conduct by Sergeant\n       Bonaparte and Captain Turner, which was also reported to the Harris\n       County District Attorney’s Office, Officer Perry can only conclude\n       that the letter of reprimand, arbitrarily enforcing an unwritten practice,\n       is intended to intimidate him and act as a smokescreen to cover up\n       their inappropriate and illegal behavior.\n\n(Emphasis added.).9\n\n       Perry also asserts he personally delivered a letter to Bonaparte on\nNovember 1 that states:\n\n       The fact that you brought up . . . two [more] issues [timely reports and\n       overtime], only after I had submitted my request for clarification and\n       guidance, reflects continued efforts to create a smokescreen and to\n       retaliate against me for bringing the illegal and unethical actions of\n       yourself and Captain Turner to the attention of the administration\n       and the District Attorney.\n\n(Emphasis added.)10\n\n       The same day, Turner sent a memorandum to AISD’s Assistant\n\n       9\n          Perry had received the letter of reprimand referenced in the Level Two grievance in late\nSeptember. On September 21, 2005, every patrol unit was called to assist with an incident at\nElsik High School referred to as a “near riot.” Perry responded and arrested a female student.\nHe and other officers took the student and several others to the police station. Perry contacted\nthe district attorney to file charges against the student for resisting arrest. Perry received the\nwritten reprimand one week later for violating an AISD procedure by contacting the district\nattorney to file charges against a student without seeking authorization from a supervisor. Perry\nalleges AISD had not previously required him to seek such authorization. AISD relied on a 1998\nmemorandum stating that officers are required to obtain authorization before contacting the\ndistrict attorney to file charges. AISD alleges the memorandum was shown to Perry when he\nwas hired.\n       10\n           The letter states that Perry previously had requested guidance on processing a warrant\nfor a juvenile offender and Bonaparte responded with complaints about Perry’s timely processing\nof reports and putting in overtime work hours to file charges.\n\n                                                5\n\fSuperintendent for Human Resources, Dr. Rose Benitez, referencing a “response”\nfrom Perry and complaining that it took three requests before Perry complied with\nBonaparte’s directive for a written response regarding a “case incident.” Perry\nalleges the “response” mentioned in the memorandum could only be the Level\nTwo grievance, which references his report of “illegal conduct” by Bonaparte and\nTurner to the district attorney.\n\n      Perry asserts that, on November 11, at approximately 12:30 p.m., he hand-\ndelivered to the superintendent’s secretary a copy of a Level Three grievance. The\nLevel Three grievance states, “The Superintendent, or his designee, failed to meet\nwith grievant [with regard to his Level Two grievance] within 10 days. This is a\nretaliation/whistleblower grievance.”11 That afternoon, Benitez and Bonaparte met\nwith Perry and terminated his employment.\n\n      Benitez testified at trial that she made the final decision to terminate Perry\nbased on Turner and Bonaparte’s recommendation; however, in her deposition\ntestimony presented at trial, she said the decision to terminate Perry was a joint\ndecision among Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte.12 Benitez also asserted at trial\n\n      11\n           On November 2, Perry had filed a Level Three grievance with the Board.\n      12\n           The deposition testimony presented at trial follows:\n      [Benitez:] I met with Dan Turner and Henry Bonaparte and counsel was with us\n      and we reviewed the information they had sent over from the police department.\n      And basically, the question from me to them was what is it that ya’ll want to do?\n      Do you want to suspend, do you want—as far as the disciplinary action. You\n      know, there is a whole range from suspension to docking a couple day’s pay,\n      more days [sic] pay, what was it that they were seeking and was that an action\n      that we could support. So we had a discussion about it. And at the end, the\n      decision was made between the three of us with counsel with us that they wanted\n      to terminate.\n      [Perry’s counsel:] And is it your testimony that the decision to terminate Mr.\n      Perry was a joint decision by everybody at the meeting?\n      [Benitez:] That’s correct.\n      [Perry’s counsel:] Okay. It wasn’t just your decision?\n                                                 6\n\fthat she was not aware that Perry had filed a grievance or provided letters “to any\nperson, that [she was] aware of at [AISD] that said he had made a report of illegal\nconduct to the Harris County DA’s office before [she] made a decision to terminate\nhim.”        Perry alleges that he told Benitez at the termination meeting that he\n“believed [he was] being retaliated against for being a whistleblower.”13 Perry also\nasserts that Benitez pulled out the October 27 “whistleblower retaliation\ngrievance” at the meeting, which Benitez denied (she testified she was looking at\nan earlier grievance filed by Perry).\n\n        On November 17, Benitez sent Perry a letter identifying the “issues\nsurrounding his job performance” as (1) failing to follow departmental procedures;\n(2) inappropriate interaction with students; (3) failing to respond to officer/dispatch\ncalls; and (4) conduct detrimental to the Alief police force. Turner testified he first\nlearned that Perry had reported him to the district attorney on November 30.\nBonaparte did not testify at trial, as discussed more fully below.\n\n                                      Procedural History\n\n        Perry filed suit against AISD on January 13, 2006, seeking an injunction and\nmonetary damages. Perry subsequently added Turner and Bonaparte as defendants\nand asserted claims, among others, for violations of the Texas Whistleblower Act 14\nand his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States\nConstitution. Meanwhile, the district attorney indicted Turner for giving a false\n\n\n        [Benitez:] Right. That’s correct.\n        13\n             Perry testified,\n        I kind of laid out the case that I had been told I had exemplary performance . . . .\n        That I hadn’t done anything. And that it was only after I had began [sic] filing\n        grievances and . . . had made the report to the District Attorney’s office that now\n        these things were coming up and that I was being persecuted.\n        14\n             Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 554.001-010.\n\n                                                 7\n\freport to a peace officer. Turner subsequently was acquitted. Perry sought to\ndepose Turner and Bonaparte, but they invoked their Fifth Amendment privileges\nagainst self-incrimination.15 Perry deposed Turner after his acquittal but never\ndeposed Bonaparte.           Appellants filed a motion for summary judgment in\nNovember 2007, based in part on Turner’s and Bonaparte’s assertion of qualified\nand official immunity, which the trial court denied. On interlocutory appeal, this\ncourt dismissed Perry’s First Amendment claims arising out of the posting on the\nCLEO website, but otherwise upheld the trial court’s denial of Turner’s and\nBonaparte’s assertions of immunity.16\n\n       After a pretrial hearing, the trial court excluded Bonaparte’s testimony based\nupon his prior assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. The jury returned a verdict against AISD on the whistleblower and\nFourteenth Amendment claims and for AISD on the First Amendment claim. The\njury found against Turner and Bonaparte on the First and Fourteenth Amendment\nclaims. The jury awarded Perry $62,500 in lost wages and $325,000 in mental\nanguish damages. The trial court entered judgment on the whistleblower and First\nAmendment claims and, alternatively, on the Fourteenth Amendment claims and\nawarded Perry $468,445 in attorney’s fees.\n\n                                          Discussion\n\n       In six issues, appellants challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence in\nsupport of Perry’s whistleblower and First Amendment claims and complain of the\ntrial court’s preventing Bonaparte from testifying in his defense, allowing Perry to\n\n       15\n           Perry’s counsel noticed and took Bonaparte’s deposition twice, but both times\nBonaparte claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege and indicated he would not answer any\nquestions.\n       16\n            Turner v. Perry, 278 S.W.3d 806, 825-26 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet.\ndenied).\n\n                                               8\n\frecover for the same injury against multiple defendants for more than one claim,\nand failing to require Perry to segregate his attorneys’ fees. In three alternative\nissues, appellants complain of the trial court’s entry of an alternative judgment in\nfavor of Perry on his Fourteenth Amendment claims.17 We conclude that the\nevidence in support of Perry’s whistleblower and First Amendment claims is\nlegally sufficient. Accordingly, we do not reach appellants’ issues involving the\nalternative judgment in favor of Perry on his Fourteenth Amendment claims. We\nfurther conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in preventing Bonaparte\nfrom testifying, the trial court did not erroneously allow Perry to recover the same\namount against appellants for multiple claims, and Perry’s attorney’s fees were\nproperly segregated. We affirm.\n\n       I.     Legal Sufficiency Challenges\n\n       In their first through third issues, appellants challenge the legal sufficiency\nof the evidence in support of Perry’s whistleblower and First Amendment claims.\n“The final test for legal sufficiency must always be whether the evidence at trial\nwould enable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under\nreview.” City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005). In reviewing\nthe evidence for legal sufficiency, we must credit favorable evidence if reasonable\nfactfinders could have done so and disregard contrary evidence unless reasonable\nfactfinders could not have done so. Id. “If the evidence . . . would enable\nreasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions, then jurors must\nbe allowed to do so.”        Id. at 822.    “A reviewing court cannot substitute its\n\n       17\n           Perry elected to recover on his whistleblower claim against AISD and First\nAmendment claim against Bonaparte and Turner, but reserved his right to a judgment in the\nalternative against appellants on his Fourteenth Amendment claim. Appellants complain of the\ntrial court’s entry of alternative judgment on Perry’s Fourteenth Amendment claim and\nsubmission of an erroneous Fourteenth Amendment liability interrogatory and a broad form\ndamages interrogatory in the court’s charge.\n\n                                             9\n\fjudgment for that of the trier-of-fact, so long as the evidence falls within this zone\nof reasonable disagreement.” Id. Although the reviewing court must consider\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every reasonable\ninference that would support the verdict, if the evidence allows only one inference,\nneither factfinder nor the reviewing court may disregard the inference. Id. We\nmeasure the sufficiency of the evidence according to the charge submitted to the\njury. Romero v. KPH Consolidation, Inc., 166 S.W.3d 212, 221 (Tex. 2005);\nBishop v. Miller, Nos. 14-12-00264-CV, 14-12-00318-CV, 2013 WL 4857891, at\n*4 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Sept. 12, 2013, no. pet. h.).\n\n             A.     Whistleblower Claim\n\n      In their first issue, appellants argue that Perry failed to present legally\nsufficient evidence of the causation element of his whistleblower claim because he\ndid not show that Benitez knew, before making her decision to terminate Perry,\nthat Perry reported the destruction of the traffic ticket to the district attorney. The\nTexas Whistleblower Act provides, “A state or local governmental entity may not\nsuspend or terminate the employment of, or take other adverse personnel action\nagainst, a public employee who in good faith reports a violation of law by the\nemploying governmental entity or another public employee to an appropriate law\nenforcement authority.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 554.002(a). Beyond satisfying each\nelement of the statute, a whistleblower plaintiff must also produce evidence that his\nreport of a legal violation caused the adverse personnel action. See City of Fort\nWorth v. Zimlich, 29 S.W.3d 62, 67 (Tex. 2000). While circumstantial evidence\nmay be sufficient to establish a causal link between the adverse employment action\nand the reporting of illegal conduct, such evidence must, at a minimum, show that\nthe person who took the adverse employment action knew of the employee’s report\nof illegal conduct. Harris Cnty. v. Vernagallo, 181 S.W.3d 17, 25 (Tex. App.—\n\n                                          10\n\fHouston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied). Obviously, a decision-maker could not\nfire an employee because of the employee’s report of alleged illegal conduct if the\ndecision-maker did not even know the employee made such a report.18 Id.\n\n       Final Decision-Makers. As an initial matter, we must decide who made the\ndecision to terminate Perry.           Appellants argue it was Benitez alone because\nBonaparte and Turner did not have the final authority to do so.                          See id.\n(acknowledging person who had “authority to hire and fire without consulting any\nother person or board” was decision-maker for purposes of whistleblower claim).\nBenitez testified that she was the final decision-maker on the matter and made her\ndecision based on Turner and Bonaparte’s recommendation. However, during her\ndeposition, Benitez testified that she, Turner, and Bonaparte made the decision\ntogether.19      We conclude this is some evidence that Turner and Bonaparte\nparticipated in the decision to terminate Perry. Thus, the jury reasonably could\nhave concluded that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte were all “decision-makers” for\npurposes of Perry’s whistleblower claim. See, e.g., Johnson v. Louisiana, 369 F.3d\n826, 831 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting, with regard to federal First Amendment\nretaliation employment discrimination claims, only “final decision-makers” may be\n\n       18\n           The jury was asked in the court’s charge, “Was Troy Perry’s report to the Harris\nCounty District Attorney’s Office that Dan Turner and Henry Bonaparte destroyed a traffic ticket\nmade in good faith and a cause of AISD terminating Troy Perry’s employment when AISD\nterminated Troy Perry’s employment?” Thus, our review is limited to whether the evidence is\nlegally sufficient to support an inference that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte knew about the\nreport to the district attorney of the destruction of the traffic ticket. See Romero, 166 S.W.3d at\n221; see also Bishop, 2013 WL 4857891, at *4.\n       19\n            The following deposition testimony was presented at trial:\n            [Perry’s counsel:] And is it your testimony that the decision to terminate Mr.\n                               Perry was a joint decision by everybody at the meeting?\n            [Benitez:]         That’s correct.\n            [Perry’s counsel:] Okay. It wasn’t just your decision?\n            [Benitez:]         Right. That’s correct.\n\n                                                 11\n\fliable, but acknowledging multiple persons could conspire together to make an\nadverse employment decision). We next consider whether the evidence supports a\nreasonable inference that any of these decision-makers knew of Perry’s report to\nthe district attorney before Perry was terminated.\n\n       Knowledge of Report to District Attorney. Perry argues the chain of\nevents presented at trial supports the jury’s finding that Benitez, Turner, and\nBonaparte all knew Perry reported the destruction of the ticket to the district\nattorney. We agree that the following evidence supports the jury’s finding:\n\n                 On July 15, during the meeting regarding Perry’s demotion,\n                 Bonaparte and Perry discussed the destruction of the traffic ticket.\n\n                 On July 25, Perry filed a Level One grievance specifically referencing\n                 the destruction of the ticket by Turner and Bonaparte.20\n\n                 A hearing was held to address the grievance on September 13, with\n                 Benitez present, so the jury reasonably could infer that Benitez would\n                 have known about Perry’s allegation with regard to the destruction of\n                 the traffic ticket.\n\n                 Perry reported the destruction of the ticket to the district attorney on\n                 October 18.\n\n                 Perry filed his Level Two grievance on October 27, which references\n                 his earlier Level One grievance and “illegal conduct by Sergeant\n                 Bonaparte and Captain Turner, which was also reported to the Harris\n\n       20\n            That grievance states:\n       Bonaparte said, “You had two complaints against you in a short period of time\n       [both regarding Perry’s issuance of traffic tickets on Bear Ram Drive, and\n       specifically the incident when he ticketed a teacher] . . [and] . . [the teacher] . . is\n       politically connected . . she’s a friend of the Capt. . . her daughter and the Capt’s\n       daughter are on the same volleyball team. Perry then asked, “So that’s why the\n       ticket is missing out of my ticket book.” Sgt. Bonaparte then said, “Yeah.”\n       Officer Perry then said, that is inappropriate. [the Capt.] should have come talk to\n       me.” Sgt. Bonaparte then said, “I understand; you’re right.”\n(Alterations including brackets and ellipses transcribed as in original.)\n\n                                                 12\n\f                County District Attorney[’]s Office.” (Emphasis added.) Reviewing\n                the two grievances in conjunction supports a reasonable inference that\n                the “illegal conduct” in the Level Two grievance referred to the\n                destruction of the traffic ticket specifically referenced in the Level\n                One grievance.\n\n                Perry testified he handed Bonaparte a letter on November 1, in which\n                he alleged that Bonaparte engaged in “continued efforts to . . .\n                retaliate against me for bringing the illegal . . . actions of yourself and\n                Captain Turner to the attention of the administration and the District\n                Attorney.” The same day, Turner sent a memorandum to Benitez\n                referencing a written response from Perry to a reprimand. Perry\n                testified the only “response” he submitted was the November 1 letter.\n                Thus, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Turner had seen the\n                letter.\n\n                Perry testified Benitez had a copy of the October 27 Level Two\n                grievance at the termination meeting, which specifically referenced\n                “illegal conduct” by Bonaparte and Turner that Perry had reported to\n                the district attorney.\n\nBased on the foregoing evidence, we conclude the jury reasonably could have\ninferred that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte all knew Perry had reported the\ndestruction of the traffic ticket to the district attorney before making the decision to\nterminate him.21 Accordingly, legally sufficient evidence supports the causation\nelement of appellants’ whistleblower claim.22\n\n\n       21\n           Appellants cite Vernagallo in support of their argument that an employee may not\nshow he was terminated for a protected activity without showing the final decision-maker knew\nof that activity. 181 S.W.3d at 25-27. In that case, Vernagallo was terminated from his job after\nhe reported illegal conduct to the district attorney by anonymous letter and subsequently in\nperson. Id. at 21. Although Vernagallo’s employer knew about the anonymous letter, the record\ndid not show he knew who wrote the letter or about Vernagallo’s in person report to the district\nattorney. Id. at 22, 27. Here, Perry presented evidence that (1) Turner and Bonaparte illegally\ndestroyed the ticket; (2) Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte jointly decided to terminate Perry and\nbefore Perry’s termination, Benitez knew about the destruction of the ticket; and (3) all three of\nthem knew about Perry’s report of “illegal conduct” by Bonaparte and Turner to the district\nattorney.\n       22\n            Appellants argue to establish causation through circumstantial evidence, Perry was\n                                               13\n\f       We overrule appellants’ first issue.\n\n               B.      First Amendment Claim\n\n       In their second and third issues, appellants argue Perry did not present\nlegally sufficient evidence of causation on his First Amendment claims against\nTurner and Bonaparte because he did not show either was a final decision-maker\nwith regard to Perry’s termination or that either knew of Perry’s report of the\ndestruction of the traffic ticket to the district attorney until after Perry’s\ntermination.\n\n       First Amendment retaliation employment discrimination claims are\nauthorized under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.23 To prove a claim under section 1983, a\nplaintiff must show a violation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the\nUnited States and demonstrate that the alleged deprivation was committed by a\nperson acting under color of state law. James v. Tex. Collin Cnty., 535 F.3d 365,\n373 (5th Cir. 2008). A plaintiff must establish that the defendant was either\npersonally involved in the deprivation or that his wrongful actions were causally\nconnected to the deprivation. Id. A supervisor is not personally liable for his\nsubordinate’s actions in which he had no involvement. Id. Only final decision-\n\n\nrequired to present evidence of all of the following under Vernagallo: knowledge of the report of\nillegal conduct, expression of a negative attitude toward the employee’s report of the illegal\nconduct, failure to adhere to established company policies regarding employment decisions,\ndiscriminatory treatment in comparison to similarly situated employees, and evidence that the\nstated reason for the adverse employment action is false. See 181 S.W.3d at 25. Setting aside\nthe fact that Perry did not rely solely on circumstantial evidence to prove causation and that he\npresented evidence of several of the things listed, AISD goes too far: Vernagallo merely holds\nthat circumstantial evidence may include evidence of the things listed; it does not hold a plaintiff\nmust present evidence of all of them. See id.\n       23\n           Claims under section 1983 may be brought against persons in their individual or\nofficial capacities or against a governmental entity. Goodman v. Harris Cnty., 571 F.3d 388, 395\n(5th Cir. 2009). Perry brought his section 1983 claim against Turner and Bonaparte in their\nindividual capacities.\n\n                                                14\n\fmakers may be held personally liable. Johnson, 369 F.3d at 831.\n\n      Final Decision-Makers. As we have concluded, the jury reasonably could\nhave inferred that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte were joint decision-makers. See\nid.   Appellants presented evidence at trial that only the superintendent or\nsuperintendent’s designee has the authority to fire an AISD employee. Benitez\ntestified she was the superintendent’s designee for the purposes of terminating\nPerry and she was the final decision-maker in that regard. However, Benitez also\nadmitted “the decision to terminate . . . Perry was a joint decision” among her,\nTurner, and Bonaparte. Moreover, Benitez conceded that Turner and Bonaparte\nparticipated in the decision to terminate Perry. See James, 535 F.3d at 373-75\n(upholding dismissal of section 1983 claim against individual defendants when\nplaintiff did not present evidence that they “participated in the decision to\nterminate his employment”); see also Jones v. City of Port Arthur, No. 1:12-CV-\n287, 2012 WL 6853909, at *10-11 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 5, 2012) (holding plaintiff had\nsufficiently pleaded section 1983 claim against four defendants who were not all\nsupervisors but jointly took adverse employment actions against plaintiff who was\nultimately terminated), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:12-CV-287,\n2013 WL 149706 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 11, 2013). We conclude that the jury was\nentitled to infer that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte were all final decision-makers\nfor purposes of terminating Perry.\n\n      Knowledge of Report to District Attorney. Appellants argue that Turner\nwas not involved in Perry’s grievances, did not know about them, and did not\nknow about the report to the district attorney until November 30, over two weeks\nafter Perry’s termination.     However, as discussed above, Perry presented\nuncontroverted evidence that Bonaparte and Turner destroyed the traffic ticket.\nAlso, Perry gave Bonaparte a letter on November 1, which included a reference to\n\n                                        15\n\fPerry bringing “the illegal . . . actions of yourself and Captain Turner to the\nattention of the administration and the District Attorney.” Appellants assert that\nthere is no evidence Turner saw the letter or knew it existed before Perry’s\ntermination on November 11.           However, on November 1, Turner sent a\nmemorandum to Benitez referencing a written response from Perry. Perry testified\nthe only “response” he submitted was the November 1 letter. We conclude the jury\nreasonably could have inferred from this evidence that Turner knew no later than\nNovember 1 that Perry had reported the destruction of the traffic ticket to the\ndistrict attorney.\n\n       Appellants similarly argue that Perry did not present evidence that\nBonaparte knew about Perry’s report to the district attorney. However, as set forth\nabove, Perry presented evidence that he and Bonaparte discussed the destruction of\nthe ticket on July 15 and Perry gave Bonaparte the November 1 letter stating he\nreported Bonaparte and Turner’s “illegal actions” to the district attorney.\nAppellants argue there is no evidence Bonaparte actually read the letter Perry\npurportedly personally delivered to Bonaparte. It would be reasonable for the jury\nto infer that Bonaparte read a letter addressed and personally delivered to him,\nespecially in light of the fact that Perry presented evidence that Turner referred to\nthe letter in the memorandum he sent to Benitez the same day Perry gave the letter\nto Bonaparte. The jury reasonably could have inferred that Bonaparte would have\nread the letter before providing it to Turner.\n\n       We overrule appellants’ second and third issues.\n\n       II.    Exclusion of Bonaparte’s Testimony\n\n       In their seventh issue, appellants argue the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fpreventing Bonaparte from testifying in his own defense at trial.24 Perry took\nBonaparte’s deposition twice at a time when Bonaparte could be subjected to\ncriminal prosecution.25 During both depositions, Bonaparte asserted the privilege\nagainst incriminating himself under the Fifth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution and refused to answer any questions.26 Appellants provided their\nwitness list eight days before trial, indicating for the first time that Bonaparte\nintended to testify at trial, but the trial court granted Perry’s motion to exclude\nBonaparte’s testimony. Appellants argue the effect of the trial court excluding\nBonaparte’s testimony was an unauthorized sanction and Perry did not properly\nchallenge Bonaparte’s assertion of the privilege by obtaining an order on his\nmotions to compel Bonaparte’s testimony.27 Perry argues Bonaparte could not use\nthe Fifth Amendment as a shield in discovery and a sword at trial, which would\nresult in “trial by ambush.” Perry further argues a party must withdraw in a timely\n       24\n           We review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of\ndiscretion. Tienda v. State, 358 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012); Kappel v. State, 402\nS.W.3d 490, 494 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.). As long as the court’s ruling\nis within the zone of reasonable disagreement, we will not disturb that ruling. Tienda, 358\nS.W.3d at 638; Kappel, 402 S.W.3d at 494.\n       25\n          Appellants concede the crime Perry reported was destruction of a government record,\nwhich carries a three year statute of limitations. See Tex. Penal Code § 37.10(a)(1), (c)(2); Tex.\nCode Crim. Proc. art. 12.01(7). Bonaparte was never indicted, but Turner was indicted and\nprosecuted for giving a false report, which carries a two year statute of limitations. See Tex.\nPenal Code § 37.08; Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 12.02. By the time of trial, the statutes of\nlimitation had run for both crimes.\n       26\n         The record on appeal does not include deposition transcripts; however, at a hearing on\nPerry’s motion to exclude Bonaparte’s testimony, Perry’s counsel informed the trial court:\n       [O]n two occasions in past years I noticed and took the deposition of Mr.\n       Bonaparte. And on both occasions, he claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege\n       and indicated that with regard to all questions tendered to him or asked of him he\n       would claim—related to Mr. Perry in this case, he would claim the Fifth\n       Amendment privilege on each and every one of them.\nAppellants do not dispute this version of events.\n       27\n         Perry apparently filed two motions to compel that the trial court did not rule on. The\nmotions to compel are not part of our record on appeal.\n\n                                                17\n\fmanner his assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege to be entitled to testify at\ntrial. We agree with Perry.\n\n       The Fifth Amendment guarantees that a person may not be compelled to\ntestify or give evidence against himself. See U.S. Const. amend. V; Maness v.\nMeyers, 419 U.S. 449, 461 (1975); In re Ferguson, No. 01-12-00607-CV, 2013\nWL 941802, at *2 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Mar. 12, 2013, no pet.). The\nFifth Amendment can be asserted in civil cases “‘wherever the answer might tend\nto subject to criminal responsibility [he] who gives it.’” Tex. Dept. of Pub. Safety\nOfficers Ass’n v. Denton, 897 S.W.2d 757, 760 (Tex. 1995) (quoting McCarthy v.\nArndstein, 266 U.S. 34, 40 (1924)).28 Thus, it may be asserted to avoid general\ncivil discovery if the person invoking it reasonably fears the answer would tend to\nincriminate him. Id.; Ferguson, 2013 WL 941802, at *2.\n\n       The Supreme Court has cautioned that the United States Constitution limits\n“‘the imposition of any sanction which makes assertion of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege ‘costly.’’” Davis-Lynch, Inc. v. Moreno, 667 F.3d 539, 547 (5th Cir.\n2012) (quoting Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 515 (1967)).                        “Given this\nconsideration—and because all parties should have a reasonable opportunity to\nlitigate a civil case fully—courts should seek out ways to permit as much\ntestimony as possible to be presented in the civil litigation, despite the assertion of\nthe privilege.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). However, courts must measure\n       28\n           The holding in Denton deals with the offensive use doctrine, which applies when a\nplaintiff asserts the privilege to protect information that is also essential to the defense. 897\nS.W.2d at 760. The offensive use doctrine allows the trial court to prohibit the plaintiff from\nintroducing evidence on the subject if certain elements are met, because a plaintiff who is\nseeking affirmative relief should not be permitted to maintain an action, and, at the same time,\nmaintain evidentiary privileges that protect from discovery outcome determinative information\nnot otherwise available to the defendant. Id. at 760-61. Here, Bonaparte asserted the privilege as\na defendant and then sought to withdraw it, so the offensive use doctrine does not apply. In our\nanalysis, we turn to federal authority regarding when a defendant may withdraw the privilege,\ndue to the lack of Texas case law on the subject.\n\n                                               18\n\f“the relative weights of the parties’ competing interests [posed by an invocation of\nthe Fifth Amendment] with a view toward accommodating those interests, if\npossible.” Id. Accordingly, courts weigh the specific facts of each case in which a\ncivil litigant has attempted to withdraw his invocation of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege. Id.\n\n      Generally, courts should allow withdrawal of the privilege if the opposing\nparties will not suffer undue prejudice from the litigant’s earlier decision to invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment. Id. Conversely, withdrawal is not permitted if the litigant is\ntrying to abuse, manipulate or gain an unfair strategic advantage over opposing\nparties. Id. The timing and circumstances under which a litigant withdraws the\nprivilege are relevant factors in considering whether a litigant is attempting to\nabuse or gain some unfair advantage because withdrawing the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege at a late stage places the opposing party at a significant disadvantage\nfrom increased costs, delays, and the need for a new investigation. Id. at 547-48.\n\n      Bonaparte asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege twice during the\ndiscovery period and did not seek to withdraw it until eight days before trial. In\nwithdrawing the privilege at such a late stage, Bonaparte withheld information that\nPerry could have used in his investigation, only to provide information at the last\nmoment, leaving Perry at a disadvantage. See id. at 549 (holding defendant’s\nwithdrawal of Fifth Amendment privilege five days before end of discovery period\nwould put plaintiff at a disadvantage by leaving him less than a week to depose\ndefendant and conduct investigation).           Given Bonaparte’s eleventh-hour\nwithdrawal of the privilege long after the discovery period had closed, we are\nsatisfied that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in preventing Bonaparte\nfrom testifying at trial. See id.\n\n      Appellants nonetheless argue that Perry was required to file a motion to\n\n                                         19\n\fcompel Bonaparte’s testimony and obtain a ruling from the trial court to challenge\nBonaparte’s assertion of the privilege. Perry, however, did not challenge the\nassertion of the privilege; rather, he challenged Bonaparte’s withdrawal of the\nprivilege. Thus, the authority Bonaparte cites to support his argument that Perry\nwas required to challenge Bonaparte’s assertion of the privilege by filing a motion\nto compel and obtaining a ruling is inapposite.29 Instead, Bonaparte was required\nto timely amend or supplement his deposition testimony before he could testify at\ntrial as to any information withheld under his claim of privilege. See Tex. R. Civ.\nP. 193.4(c) (“A party may not use—at any hearing or trial—material or\ninformation withheld from discovery under a claim of privilege . . . without timely\namending or supplementing the party’s response to that discovery.”), 193.5\n(requiring party to supplement incomplete or incorrect discovery responses). We\nconclude Perry was not required to file a motion to compel to challenge\nBonaparte’s withdrawal of the privilege.\n\n       We overrule appellants’ seventh issue.\n\n       III.   One Satisfaction Rule\n\n       In their eighth issue, appellants argue the trial court abused its discretion by\n       29\n           See Webb v. Maldonado, 331 S.W.3d 879, 884 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied)\n(refusing to consider on appeal from grant of no-evidence motion for summary judgment\nwhether privilege was properly invoked when nonmovants had not “filed a motion to compel or\notherwise sought the assistance of the trial court to resolve the discovery impasse caused by\n[movant] asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to every\ndeposition question”); In re Garza, No. 13-07-401-CV, 2007 WL 2246779, at *2-3 (Tex. App.—\nCorpus Christi Aug. 6, 2007, no pet.) (mem. op.) (acknowledging before a party may be\ncompelled to respond to discovery over an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege, the trial\ncourt must review the discovery request, apply the law of privilege, discovery and protection to\nthe request, and determine how best to protect the privilege, the right to proceed with the case,\nand the right to defend the suit); Marshall v. Ryder Sys., Inc., 928 S.W.2d 190, 196 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied) (noting, to avoid sanctioning party who has offensively\nused privilege, trial court may look at questions asked in discovery to determine “whether a more\nnarrow inquiry could serve the defendant’s discovery needs and allow the plaintiff to avoid . . .\nself-incrimination”).\n\n                                               20\n\ffailing to require Perry to elect his remedies between his whistleblower and First\nAmendment claims in violation of the one satisfaction rule.             See Tony Gullo\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tex. 2006). Perry argues the final\njudgment complies with the one satisfaction rule because it imposes joint and\nseveral liability for Perry’s single, indivisible injury.\n\n       The one satisfaction rule applies to prevent a plaintiff from obtaining more\nthan one recovery for the same injury. Id.; Christus Health v. Dorriety, 345\nS.W.3d 104, 114 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. denied). The rule\napplies when multiple defendants commit the same act as well as when defendants\ncommit technically different acts that result in a single injury. Christus Health,\n345 S.W.3d at 114. If a party receives favorable findings on two or more theories\nof recovery that are consistent with each other and result in the same damages, then\nthe trial court may render judgment awarding a single recovery of these damages,\nand the judgment may be based on all of these theories. Hatfield v. Solomon, 316\nS.W.3d 50, 59 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n       Here, the trial court entered a final judgment imposing a single recovery of\ndamages holding appellants jointly and severally liable up to the amount of AISD’s\ncapped damages.30 Turner and Bonaparte also are jointly and severally liable\nunder the final judgment for the difference between the capped and non-capped\namounts. Because the damages recoverable under the whistleblower and First\nAmendment claims are identical (but for the statutorily capped amount as to AISD)\nand because the trial court awarded a single recovery of damages, Perry was not\nrequired to elect between these theories of recovery. See id. Moreover, the\nimposition of joint and several liability avoids the possibility of a double recovery.\n       30\n          The final judgment awards Perry $62,500 in lost wages, $325,000 in mental anguish\ndamages, capped at $250,000 for AISD under Texas Government Code section 554.003(c)(4),\npre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs of court.\n\n                                            21\n\fSee, e.g., Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 390-92 (Tex. 2000)\n(holding when defendants commit technically different acts that cause a single\ninjury, nonsettling defendants may claim settlement credit based on damages for\nwhich all tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable to avoid double recovery);\nDirect Value, L.L.C. v. Stock Bldg. Supply, L.L.C., 388 S.W.3d 386, 394-95 (Tex.\nApp.—Amarillo 2012, no pet.) (“[T]he trial court’s joint and several judgment\n[against two defendants on two theories of liability] is proper because it does not\npermit more than one recovery for [the plaintiff’s] single injury.”); Spillman v.\nSelf-Serv Fixture Co., 693 S.W.2d 656, 658 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1985, writ ref’d\nn.r.e.) (acknowledging failure to impose joint and several liability on multiple\ndefendants for single injury permits potential double recovery).\n\n       We overrule appellants’ eighth issue.\n\n       IV.    Segregation of Attorneys’ Fees\n\n       In their ninth issue, appellants argue the trial court erred in failing to require\nPerry to segregate his attorneys’ fees by theory of liability because AISD cannot be\nheld liable under section 1983 for the conduct of Bonaparte and Turner and\nBonaparte and Turner cannot be held liable under the Whistleblower Act.31 See\nEugene v. Alief Indep. Sch. Dist., 65 F.3d 1299, 1304 (5th Cir. 1995) (noting AISD\ncannot be held vicariously liable under section 1983 for the actions of its\nemployees); see also Tex. Gov’t Code § 554.002(a) (applicable to state or local\ngovernment entity). Perry argues that he properly segregated his fees by applying\nan appropriate percentage reduction under the standard enunciated by the Texas\nSupreme Court in Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314.\n\n\n       31\n           Perry was entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees against AISD on his whistleblower\nclaim, see Texas Government Code section 554.003(a)(4), and against Bonaparte and Turner on\nhis section 1983 claim, see 42 U.S.C. section 1988.\n\n                                             22\n\f       Generally, a party seeking attorney’s fees must segregate those fees incurred\nin connection with a claim that allows their recovery from fees incurred in\nconnection with claims for which no such recovery is allowed. Westergren v. Nat’l\nProp. Holdings, L.P., Nos. 14-11-00058-CV, 14-11-00229-CV, 2013 WL\n4857689, at *20 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] June 28, 2013, pet. filed).\nTexas courts recognize an exception to this general rule. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n311; Westergren, 2013 WL 4857689, at *20. When discrete legal services advance\nboth recoverable and unrecoverable claims, attorneys are not required to segregate\nfees to recover the total amount covering all claims.              Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n313-14; Westergren, 2013 WL 4857689, at *20. In this situation, the claims are\nsaid to be “intertwined,” and the mere fact that attorneys’ fees are incurred in\nadvancing both recoverable and unrecoverable claims does not render those fees\nunrecoverable. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313–14; Westergren, 2013 WL 4857689, at\n*20.    But if any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which fees are\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313; Westergren, 2013 WL 4857689, at *20.\n\n       Attorneys are not required to keep separate records documenting the exact\namount of time working on one recoverable claim versus an unrecoverable claim.\nSee Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314; Citizens Nat’l Bank of Tex. v. NXS Const., Inc.,\n387 S.W.3d 74, 87 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.). Rather,\nsegregation is sufficiently established if, for example, an attorney testifies that a\ngiven percentage of the drafting time would have been necessary even if the claim\nfor which attorney’s fees are unrecoverable had not been asserted.32 Chapa, 212\n\n       32\n          See Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314 & n.83 (citing Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Aiello, 941\nS.W.2d 68, 73 (Tex. 1997) (noting that claimant’s attorney “testified that approximately twenty\npercent of his time and fifteen‑ percent of his paralegal’s time concerned issues predating the\nagreed judgment”), and Med. Specialist Group, P.A. v. Radiology Assocs., L.L.P., 171 S.W.3d\n727, 738 (Tex.

Perry submitted redacted invoices of his attorneys in\nsupport of his motion for attorneys’ fees, along with an affidavit of his attorney\nJames L. Reed.         Reed attested that he reduced the reasonable and necessary\nattorneys’ fees Perry incurred in prosecuting his claims by ten percent to segregate\nout claims for which attorneys’ fees were not recoverable.                         Perry sought\n$520,498.53 in attorneys’ fees, before applying a multiplier.33\n\n       Reed further attested:\n\n       With regard to all of the claims asserted in this lawsuit, both the\n       claims that were non-suited and the claims that were tried, the\n       underlying facts which would have supported the liability claims and\n       damages were the same. More particularly, all of the claims asserted\n       related to the fact that the Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff,\n       deprived Plaintiff of fundamental rights guaranteed by AISD policy\n       and Texas law, and damaged his reputation, causing mental anguish.\n       All of the discovery that was taken in the case would have been\n       equally applicable to the claims that were non-suited prior to the trial\n       and the claims that were tried to the jury. All of the claims that were\n       tried to the jury are claims for which attorneys’ fees can be recovered.\n\n       ....\n       [I]t is my opinion that less than 10% of the attorneys’ fee time spent in\n       this case relates solely to the claims that were non-suited prior to trial.\n       In the abundance of caution, and to put forth a conservative\n       segregation claim, I have subtracted 10% of the hours of [attorney]\n\ncounsel . . . testified that his fees for the defense of the case totaled $460,087.00, and\napproximately forty percent of these fees were directly related to Saratoga’s antitrust claims.”)).\n       33\n          Perry requested a multiplier of three times the lodestar amount, which the trial court\ndenied. See City of Houston v. Levingston, 221 S.W.3d 204, 237 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 2006, no pet.) (“After calculating the lodestar amount, a trial court can adjust the lodestar\namount upward to account for the well-established Johnson factors.”) (citing Johnson v. Ga.\nHighway Exp., Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974)).\n\n                                                24\n\f       time spent in this case . . . .34\n\n       In their response to the motion, appellants complained that Perry was\nrequired to further “segregate his damages attributable to the governmental entity\nfrom those attributable to the individual defendants.” In reply, Perry submitted\nanother affidavit from Reed reducing the attorneys’ fees by another ten percent,\nfive percent as to each claim, to segregate the fees as between the whistleblower\nand section 1983 claims (First and Fourteenth Amendments).\n\n       Reed attested:\n\n       In my opinion, the basic underlying conduct related to the Texas\n       Whistleblower claim and the First Amendment claim is the same or\n       substantially the same (the reporting of illegal conduct to the Harris\n       County District Attorney’s Office (“HCDA”)). As a consequence,\n       AISD is receiving the appropriate [Chapa] reduction.\n\n       ....\n\n       [I]n my opinion, the attorneys’ fees attributable to each of Plaintiff’s\n       three causes of action [whistleblower and First and Fourteenth\n       Amendments] should be reduced by an additional five (5) percent for\n       each claim that a Defendant is not liable. The five (5) percent\n       reduction with regard to each of the claims is to address the legal\n       aspects and characteristics of research and specific legal analysis that\n       would be attributable only to either the whistleblower claim, and/or\n       the First and Fourteenth Amendment claims.\n       ....\n\n       The result of such reduction is as follows:\n\n       • AISD - reduction of another ten (10) percent, added to the original\n         ten (10) percent reduction (5%, related to the First Amendment\n         claim and 5% related to the Fourteenth Amendment claim [only\n\n       34\n           Reed also attested that Perry’s previous attorney incurred approximately $40,000 in\nattorney’s fees for work related to “early grievances and in preparing and filing the Original\nPetition.” Perry did not seek to recover any portion of those fees.\n\n                                             25\n\f            being sought as an alternative claim]); and\n\n       • Turner and Bonaparte reduction of another ten (10) percent, added\n         to the original ten (10) percent (5% related to the Texas\n         Whistleblower claim and 5% related to the Fourteenth Amendment\n         claim [only being sought as an alternative claim]).\n       Accordingly, Perry attributed approximately 80% of his attorneys’ fees to\neach claim to each appellant for which fees were recoverable. After the additional\ndiscount and segregation of fees, the total amount of attorneys’ fees sought before\na multiplier was $468,445.35 We conclude Perry presented evidence of how he\nsegregated fees as to liability for each claim by each party. We hold that the\nevidence supports a conclusion that Perry properly and adequately segregated\nattorneys’ fees as between his whistleblower and section 1983 claims under the\nstandard enunciated in Chapa.

We affirm.\n\f                                         Factual History\n\n       AISD maintains its own police force. In 2004, AISD hired Perry to join\nAISD’s police force as “gang officer” to address gang-related activity in AISD\nschools.1 In mid-2005, Turner, then captain of the police force,2 allegedly was\napproached by “more than one” AISD campus principals who expressed concern\nover “the way [Perry] dealt with students.”3 Appellants assert that these incidents\nwere “part of a pattern of problems caused by Perry’s behavior,” including\nallegedly referring to students as “ghetto kids,” “escalating situations with\nstudents,” “acting inappropriately with students,” “violating all sorts of\n[departmental] procedures,” and failing to seek permission from a supervisor\nbefore contacting the district attorney to bring charges against a student.\nAppellants allege that Turner and Bonaparte, who was at the time a sergeant acting\nas Perry’s supervisor,4 had numerous conversations with Perry about these issues.\nPerry denies the allegations.\n\n       Perry alleges that in late 2004, he met with the mayor’s anti-gang task force\nrepresentative, who had heard a rumor of a planned May 5th nationwide gang war\nthat would involve Houston gang members.                       Perry sent an email to gang\n\n       1\n           Perry previously had been a Harris County deputy sheriff.\n       2\n           By the time of trial, Turner had been promoted to chief of the police force.\n       3\n          One principal was concerned about “the rough temperament that . . . Perry use[d] when\nhe [was] interviewing students or talking to students.” Allegedly, Perry was involved in a\nconfrontation with a student and the student’s parent, who were both apparently arrested. Turner\ntestified, “Perry intervened with a student and it became confrontational and the student was\narrested and, if I’m not mistaken, so was the student[’s] parent.” Turner did not know the names\nof the student or parent. Turner could not remember if Perry’s actions with regard to this\nincident were investigated.\n        Another principal was concerned with “the way that . . . Perry . . . interacts with students”\nand allegedly asked Turner “to keep him off of her campus.” Turner did not know what incident\nthat principal was referring to.\n       4\n           By the time of trial, Bonaparte had been promoted to captain of the police force.\n\n                                                  2\n\finvestigators both inside and outside of AISD warning them about this possible\nevent.5 Perry asserts that an anti-gang liaison with the Texas Attorney General’s\nOffice contacted him in response to the email and asked, “Do you mind if I post\nthis on CLEO?”6 According to Perry, “[I]t’s obviously in the best interest of law\nenforcement agencies to have every avenue of information that they could, so I\nsaid yes.” Perry asserts that Bonaparte told him “the superintendent had been\nreceiving lots of phone calls [because of the CLEO posting],” “was upset because\nthis information had gotten outside of the district,” and “the district was\nembarrassed.” Bonaparte also told Perry, “in the past[,] previous gang officers had\n[interacted with the community to address gang problems] and . . . that tended to\nlower the property values in the area,” which AISD did not like. On May 4,\nBonaparte sent Perry a written notice stating he was not to disseminate information\nregarding “activities in and around this district . . . without prior written approval\nfrom [the] departmental supervisor.”\n\n       On June 13, Perry received an annual performance evaluation indicating his\nperformance “m[et] expectations.” Later that month, after he issued a traffic ticket\nto an AISD teacher, Bonaparte and Turner removed the ticket from the citation\nbook in Perry’s office.7 Approximately two weeks later, Turner put Perry on a\ndisciplinary “Growth Plan,” which appellants allege was intended to help Perry\n“identify and improve his performance problems” listed on the plan as “[a]reas of\nidentified weakness,” including (1) failing to follow the chain of command;\n(2) inappropriate attitude and demeanor; (3) failing to follow patrol protocol such\n\n       5\n           Turner and Bonaparte were copied on the email.\n       6\n         CLEO, which stands for “Criminal Law Enforcement Online,” is an information-\nsharing database maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. It is accessible only by\nlaw enforcement personnel.\n       7\n           Appellants do not dispute this fact.\n\n                                                  3\n\fas responding to calls and requests for backup; and (4) spending excessive time in\nthe office. At the same time, Perry was demoted from gang officer to patrol officer\nand lost a weekend day off. Perry asserts during a meeting to discuss the plan,\nBonaparte admitted he took the traffic ticket out of Perry’s office because the\nteacher Perry had ticketed was a friend of Turner’s and “politically connected.”\n\n      On July 25, 2005, Perry filed a grievance8 complaining about his\nreassignment, alleging it was the result, in part, of his ticketing the teacher. The\ngrievance also states that Bonaparte admitted removing the ticket from Perry’s\ncitation book. On September 13, 2005, a hearing on Perry’s grievance was held.\nBonaparte signed the decision denying relief. Perry filed his Level Two grievance\non October 11, 2005. Perry filed a Level Three grievance on November 2, 2005\nbecause neither the superintendent nor his designee met with Perry before the\nrequired deadline. No further action was taken on this grievance.\n\n      On October 18, 2005, Perry filed a formal complaint with the district\nattorney reporting the destruction of the traffic ticket by Bonaparte and Turner.\nPerry alleges he hand-delivered a new Level Two grievance to the AISD’s\n\n\n      8\n          AISD has a four-step process for an employee to pursue a grievance:\n            1. The employee and his immediate supervisor meet for an informal conference.\n            2. If the employee is dissatisfied, he may “file” a Level One grievance with his\n               supervisor. A Level One conference is then held between the “appropriate\n               administrator” and the employee, after which the administrator must provide the\n               employee with a written response.\n            3. The employee may appeal the response by filing a Level Two grievance. The\n               superintendent then must conduct a conference with the employee and\n               subsequently provide a written response to the Level Two grievance.\n            4. The employee may appeal by filing a Level Three grievance, which is submitted\n               to the Board of Trustees. Then, the Board determines whether the grievance\n               merits a hearing. If so, the Board may make its determination orally or in writing.\n               The lack of a response by the Board by the end of its next meeting upholds the\n               Level Two decision.\n\n                                                4\n\fsuperintendent’s office on October 27, 2005, with the heading “Level II grievance\nRetaliation/Whistleblower.” The grievance states,\n\n       Due to the recent grievance filed by Officer Perry, reference [sic]\n       inappropriate disciplinary action and illegal conduct by Sergeant\n       Bonaparte and Captain Turner, which was also reported to the Harris\n       County District Attorney’s Office, Officer Perry can only conclude\n       that the letter of reprimand, arbitrarily enforcing an unwritten practice,\n       is intended to intimidate him and act as a smokescreen to cover up\n       their inappropriate and illegal behavior.\n\n(Emphasis added.).9\n\n       Perry also asserts he personally delivered a letter to Bonaparte on\nNovember 1 that states:\n\n       The fact that you brought up . . . two [more] issues [timely reports and\n       overtime], only after I had submitted my request for clarification and\n       guidance, reflects continued efforts to create a smokescreen and to\n       retaliate against me for bringing the illegal and unethical actions of\n       yourself and Captain Turner to the attention of the administration\n       and the District Attorney.\n\n(Emphasis added.)10\n\n       The same day, Turner sent a memorandum to AISD’s Assistant\n\n       9\n          Perry had received the letter of reprimand referenced in the Level Two grievance in late\nSeptember. On September 21, 2005, every patrol unit was called to assist with an incident at\nElsik High School referred to as a “near riot.” Perry responded and arrested a female student.\nHe and other officers took the student and several others to the police station. Perry contacted\nthe district attorney to file charges against the student for resisting arrest. Perry received the\nwritten reprimand one week later for violating an AISD procedure by contacting the district\nattorney to file charges against a student without seeking authorization from a supervisor. Perry\nalleges AISD had not previously required him to seek such authorization. AISD relied on a 1998\nmemorandum stating that officers are required to obtain authorization before contacting the\ndistrict attorney to file charges. AISD alleges the memorandum was shown to Perry when he\nwas hired.\n       10\n           The letter states that Perry previously had requested guidance on processing a warrant\nfor a juvenile offender and Bonaparte responded with complaints about Perry’s timely processing\nof reports and putting in overtime work hours to file charges.\n\n                                                5\n\fSuperintendent for Human Resources, Dr. Rose Benitez, referencing a “response”\nfrom Perry and complaining that it took three requests before Perry complied with\nBonaparte’s directive for a written response regarding a “case incident.” Perry\nalleges the “response” mentioned in the memorandum could only be the Level\nTwo grievance, which references his report of “illegal conduct” by Bonaparte and\nTurner to the district attorney.\n\n      Perry asserts that, on November 11, at approximately 12:30 p.m., he hand-\ndelivered to the superintendent’s secretary a copy of a Level Three grievance. The\nLevel Three grievance states, “The Superintendent, or his designee, failed to meet\nwith grievant [with regard to his Level Two grievance] within 10 days. This is a\nretaliation/whistleblower grievance.”11 That afternoon, Benitez and Bonaparte met\nwith Perry and terminated his employment.\n\n      Benitez testified at trial that she made the final decision to terminate Perry\nbased on Turner and Bonaparte’s recommendation; however, in her deposition\ntestimony presented at trial, she said the decision to terminate Perry was a joint\ndecision among Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte.12 Benitez also asserted at trial\n\n      11\n           On November 2, Perry had filed a Level Three grievance with the Board.\n      12\n           The deposition testimony presented at trial follows:\n      [Benitez:] I met with Dan Turner and Henry Bonaparte and counsel was with us\n      and we reviewed the information they had sent over from the police department.\n      And basically, the question from me to them was what is it that ya’ll want to do?\n      Do you want to suspend, do you want—as far as the disciplinary action. You\n      know, there is a whole range from suspension to docking a couple day’s pay,\n      more days [sic] pay, what was it that they were seeking and was that an action\n      that we could support. So we had a discussion about it. And at the end, the\n      decision was made between the three of us with counsel with us that they wanted\n      to terminate.\n      [Perry’s counsel:] And is it your testimony that the decision to terminate Mr.\n      Perry was a joint decision by everybody at the meeting?\n      [Benitez:] That’s correct.\n      [Perry’s counsel:] Okay. It wasn’t just your decision?\n                                                 6\n\fthat she was not aware that Perry had filed a grievance or provided letters “to any\nperson, that [she was] aware of at [AISD] that said he had made a report of illegal\nconduct to the Harris County DA’s office before [she] made a decision to terminate\nhim.”        Perry alleges that he told Benitez at the termination meeting that he\n“believed [he was] being retaliated against for being a whistleblower.”13 Perry also\nasserts that Benitez pulled out the October 27 “whistleblower retaliation\ngrievance” at the meeting, which Benitez denied (she testified she was looking at\nan earlier grievance filed by Perry).\n\n        On November 17, Benitez sent Perry a letter identifying the “issues\nsurrounding his job performance” as (1) failing to follow departmental procedures;\n(2) inappropriate interaction with students; (3) failing to respond to officer/dispatch\ncalls; and (4) conduct detrimental to the Alief police force. Turner testified he first\nlearned that Perry had reported him to the district attorney on November 30.\nBonaparte did not testify at trial, as discussed more fully below.\n\n                                      Procedural History\n\n        Perry filed suit against AISD on January 13, 2006, seeking an injunction and\nmonetary damages. Perry subsequently added Turner and Bonaparte as defendants\nand asserted claims, among others, for violations of the Texas Whistleblower Act 14\nand his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States\nConstitution.

Appellants filed a motion for summary judgment in\nNovember 2007, based in part on Turner’s and Bonaparte’s assertion of qualified\nand official immunity, which the trial court denied. On interlocutory appeal, this\ncourt dismissed Perry’s First Amendment claims arising out of the posting on the\nCLEO website, but otherwise upheld the trial court’s denial of Turner’s and\nBonaparte’s assertions of immunity.16\n\n       After a pretrial hearing, the trial court excluded Bonaparte’s testimony based\nupon his prior assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. The jury returned a verdict against AISD on the whistleblower and\nFourteenth Amendment claims and for AISD on the First Amendment claim. The\njury found against Turner and Bonaparte on the First and Fourteenth Amendment\nclaims. The jury awarded Perry $62,500 in lost wages and $325,000 in mental\nanguish damages. The trial court entered judgment on the whistleblower and First\nAmendment claims and, alternatively, on the Fourteenth Amendment claims and\nawarded Perry $468,445 in attorney’s fees.\n\n                                          Discussion\n\n       In six issues, appellants challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence in\nsupport of Perry’s whistleblower and First Amendment claims and complain of the\ntrial court’s preventing Bonaparte from testifying in his defense, allowing Perry to\n\n       15\n           Perry’s counsel noticed and took Bonaparte’s deposition twice, but both times\nBonaparte claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege and indicated he would not answer any\nquestions.\n       16\n            Turner v.

Whistleblower Claim\n\n      In their first issue, appellants argue that Perry failed to present legally\nsufficient evidence of the causation element of his whistleblower claim because he\ndid not show that Benitez knew, before making her decision to terminate Perry,\nthat Perry reported the destruction of the traffic ticket to the district attorney. The\nTexas Whistleblower Act provides, “A state or local governmental entity may not\nsuspend or terminate the employment of, or take other adverse personnel action\nagainst, a public employee who in good faith reports a violation of law by the\nemploying governmental entity or another public employee to an appropriate law\nenforcement authority.” Tex. Gov’t Code § 554.002(a). Beyond satisfying each\nelement of the statute, a whistleblower plaintiff must also produce evidence that his\nreport of a legal violation caused the adverse personnel action. See City of Fort\nWorth v. Zimlich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1473451\"><a href=\"/opinion/1473451/city-of-fort-worth-v-zimlich/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (Tex. 2000). While circumstantial evidence\nmay be sufficient to establish a causal link between the adverse employment action\nand the reporting of illegal conduct, such evidence must, at a minimum, show that\nthe person who took the adverse employment action knew of the employee’s report\nof illegal conduct.

Obviously, a decision-maker could not\nfire an employee because of the employee’s report of alleged illegal conduct if the\ndecision-maker did not even know the employee made such a report.18 Id.\n\n       Final Decision-Makers. As an initial matter, we must decide who made the\ndecision to terminate Perry.           Appellants argue it was Benitez alone because\nBonaparte and Turner did not have the final authority to do so.                          See id.\n(acknowledging person who had “authority to hire and fire without consulting any\nother person or board” was decision-maker for purposes of whistleblower claim).\nBenitez testified that she was the final decision-maker on the matter and made her\ndecision based on Turner and Bonaparte’s recommendation. However, during her\ndeposition, Benitez testified that she, Turner, and Bonaparte made the decision\ntogether.19      We conclude this is some evidence that Turner and Bonaparte\nparticipated in the decision to terminate Perry. Thus, the jury reasonably could\nhave concluded that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte were all “decision-makers” for\npurposes of Perry’s whistleblower claim. See, e.g., Johnson v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"35239\"><a href=\"/opinion/35239/johnson-v-state-of-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 831 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting, with regard to federal First Amendment\nretaliation employment discrimination claims, only “final decision-makers” may be\n\n       18\n           The jury was asked in the court’s charge, “Was Troy Perry’s report to the Harris\nCounty District Attorney’s Office that Dan Turner and Henry Bonaparte destroyed a traffic ticket\nmade in good faith and a cause of AISD terminating Troy Perry’s employment when AISD\nterminated Troy Perry’s employment?” Thus, our review is limited to whether the evidence is\nlegally sufficient to support an inference that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte knew about the\nreport to the district attorney of the destruction of the traffic ticket.

We next consider whether the evidence supports a\nreasonable inference that any of these decision-makers knew of Perry’s report to\nthe district attorney before Perry was terminated.\n\n       Knowledge of Report to District Attorney. Perry argues the chain of\nevents presented at trial supports the jury’s finding that Benitez, Turner, and\nBonaparte all knew Perry reported the destruction of the ticket to the district\nattorney. We agree that the following evidence supports the jury’s finding:\n\n                 On July 15, during the meeting regarding Perry’s demotion,\n                 Bonaparte and Perry discussed the destruction of the traffic ticket.\n\n                 On July 25, Perry filed a Level One grievance specifically referencing\n                 the destruction of the ticket by Turner and Bonaparte.20\n\n                 A hearing was held to address the grievance on September 13, with\n                 Benitez present, so the jury reasonably could infer that Benitez would\n                 have known about Perry’s allegation with regard to the destruction of\n                 the traffic ticket.\n\n                 Perry reported the destruction of the ticket to the district attorney on\n                 October 18.\n\n                 Perry filed his Level Two grievance on October 27, which references\n                 his earlier Level One grievance and “illegal conduct by Sergeant\n                 Bonaparte and Captain Turner, which was also reported to the Harris\n\n       20\n            That grievance states:\n       Bonaparte said, “You had two complaints against you in a short period of time\n       [both regarding Perry’s issuance of traffic tickets on Bear Ram Drive, and\n       specifically the incident when he ticketed a teacher] . . [and] . . [the teacher] . . is\n       politically connected . . she’s a friend of the Capt. . . her daughter and the Capt’s\n       daughter are on the same volleyball team. Perry then asked, “So that’s why the\n       ticket is missing out of my ticket book.” Sgt. Bonaparte then said, “Yeah.”\n       Officer Perry then said, that is inappropriate. [the Capt.] should have come talk to\n       me.” Sgt. Bonaparte then said, “I understand; you’re right.”\n(Alterations including brackets and ellipses transcribed as in original.)\n\n                                                 12\n\f                County District Attorney[’]s Office.” (Emphasis added.) Reviewing\n                the two grievances in conjunction supports a reasonable inference that\n                the “illegal conduct” in the Level Two grievance referred to the\n                destruction of the traffic ticket specifically referenced in the Level\n                One grievance.\n\n                Perry testified he handed Bonaparte a letter on November 1, in which\n                he alleged that Bonaparte engaged in “continued efforts to . . .\n                retaliate against me for bringing the illegal . . . actions of yourself and\n                Captain Turner to the attention of the administration and the District\n                Attorney.” The same day, Turner sent a memorandum to Benitez\n                referencing a written response from Perry to a reprimand. Perry\n                testified the only “response” he submitted was the November 1 letter.\n                Thus, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Turner had seen the\n                letter.\n\n                Perry testified Benitez had a copy of the October 27 Level Two\n                grievance at the termination meeting, which specifically referenced\n                “illegal conduct” by Bonaparte and Turner that Perry had reported to\n                the district attorney.\n\nBased on the foregoing evidence, we conclude the jury reasonably could have\ninferred that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte all knew Perry had reported the\ndestruction of the traffic ticket to the district attorney before making the decision to\nterminate him.21 Accordingly, legally sufficient evidence supports the causation\nelement of appellants’ whistleblower claim.22\n\n\n       21\n           Appellants cite Vernagallo in support of their argument that an employee may not\nshow he was terminated for a protected activity without showing the final decision-maker knew\nof that activity. 181 S.W.3d at 25-27. In that case, Vernagallo was terminated from his job after\nhe reported illegal conduct to the district attorney by anonymous letter and subsequently in\nperson. Id. at 21. Although Vernagallo’s employer knew about the anonymous letter, the record\ndid not show he knew who wrote the letter or about Vernagallo’s in person report to the district\nattorney. Id. at 22, 27. Here, Perry presented evidence that (1) Turner and Bonaparte illegally\ndestroyed the ticket; (2) Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte jointly decided to terminate Perry and\nbefore Perry’s termination, Benitez knew about the destruction of the ticket; and (3) all three of\nthem knew about Perry’s report of “illegal conduct” by Bonaparte and Turner to the district\nattorney.\n       22\n            Appellants argue to establish causation through circumstantial evidence, Perry was\n                                               13\n\f       We overrule appellants’ first issue.\n\n               B.      First Amendment Claim\n\n       In their second and third issues, appellants argue Perry did not present\nlegally sufficient evidence of causation on his First Amendment claims against\nTurner and Bonaparte because he did not show either was a final decision-maker\nwith regard to Perry’s termination or that either knew of Perry’s report of the\ndestruction of the traffic ticket to the district attorney until after Perry’s\ntermination.\n\n       First Amendment retaliation employment discrimination claims are\nauthorized under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.23 To prove a claim under section 1983, a\nplaintiff must show a violation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the\nUnited States and demonstrate that the alleged deprivation was committed by a\nperson acting under color of state law.

See 181 S.W.3d at 25. Setting aside\nthe fact that Perry did not rely solely on circumstantial evidence to prove causation and that he\npresented evidence of several of the things listed, AISD goes too far: Vernagallo merely holds\nthat circumstantial evidence may include evidence of the things listed; it does not hold a plaintiff\nmust present evidence of all of them.

Benitez\ntestified she was the superintendent’s designee for the purposes of terminating\nPerry and she was the final decision-maker in that regard. However, Benitez also\nadmitted “the decision to terminate . . . Perry was a joint decision” among her,\nTurner, and Bonaparte. Moreover, Benitez conceded that Turner and Bonaparte\nparticipated in the decision to terminate Perry. See James, 535 F.3d at 373-75\n(upholding dismissal of section 1983 claim against individual defendants when\nplaintiff did not present evidence that they “participated in the decision to\nterminate his employment”); see also Jones v.

We conclude that the jury was\nentitled to infer that Benitez, Turner, and Bonaparte were all final decision-makers\nfor purposes of terminating Perry.\n\n      Knowledge of Report to District Attorney. Appellants argue that Turner\nwas not involved in Perry’s grievances, did not know about them, and did not\nknow about the report to the district attorney until November 30, over two weeks\nafter Perry’s termination.     However, as discussed above, Perry presented\nuncontroverted evidence that Bonaparte and Turner destroyed the traffic ticket.\nAlso, Perry gave Bonaparte a letter on November 1, which included a reference to\n\n                                        15\n\fPerry bringing “the illegal . . . actions of yourself and Captain Turner to the\nattention of the administration and the District Attorney.” Appellants assert that\nthere is no evidence Turner saw the letter or knew it existed before Perry’s\ntermination on November 11.           However, on November 1, Turner sent a\nmemorandum to Benitez referencing a written response from Perry. Perry testified\nthe only “response” he submitted was the November 1 letter. We conclude the jury\nreasonably could have inferred from this evidence that Turner knew no later than\nNovember 1 that Perry had reported the destruction of the traffic ticket to the\ndistrict attorney.\n\n       Appellants similarly argue that Perry did not present evidence that\nBonaparte knew about Perry’s report to the district attorney. However, as set forth\nabove, Perry presented evidence that he and Bonaparte discussed the destruction of\nthe ticket on July 15 and Perry gave Bonaparte the November 1 letter stating he\nreported Bonaparte and Turner’s “illegal actions” to the district attorney.\nAppellants argue there is no evidence Bonaparte actually read the letter Perry\npurportedly personally delivered to Bonaparte. It would be reasonable for the jury\nto infer that Bonaparte read a letter addressed and personally delivered to him,\nespecially in light of the fact that Perry presented evidence that Turner referred to\nthe letter in the memorandum he sent to Benitez the same day Perry gave the letter\nto Bonaparte. The jury reasonably could have inferred that Bonaparte would have\nread the letter before providing it to Turner.\n\n       We overrule appellants’ second and third issues.\n\n       II.    Exclusion of Bonaparte’s Testimony\n\n       In their seventh issue, appellants argue the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fpreventing Bonaparte from testifying in his own defense at trial.24 Perry took\nBonaparte’s deposition twice at a time when Bonaparte could be subjected to\ncriminal prosecution.25 During both depositions, Bonaparte asserted the privilege\nagainst incriminating himself under the Fifth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution and refused to answer any questions.26 Appellants provided their\nwitness list eight days before trial, indicating for the first time that Bonaparte\nintended to testify at trial, but the trial court granted Perry’s motion to exclude\nBonaparte’s testimony. Appellants argue the effect of the trial court excluding\nBonaparte’s testimony was an unauthorized sanction and Perry did not properly\nchallenge Bonaparte’s assertion of the privilege by obtaining an order on his\nmotions to compel Bonaparte’s testimony.27 Perry argues Bonaparte could not use\nthe Fifth Amendment as a shield in discovery and a sword at trial, which would\nresult in “trial by ambush.” Perry further argues a party must withdraw in a timely\n       24\n           We review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of\ndiscretion.

(internal quotations omitted). However, courts must measure\n       28\n           The holding in Denton deals with the offensive use doctrine, which applies when a\nplaintiff asserts the privilege to protect information that is also essential to the defense. 897\nS.W.2d at 760. The offensive use doctrine allows the trial court to prohibit the plaintiff from\nintroducing evidence on the subject if certain elements are met, because a plaintiff who is\nseeking affirmative relief should not be permitted to maintain an action, and, at the same time,\nmaintain evidentiary privileges that protect from discovery outcome determinative information\nnot otherwise available to the defendant. Id. at 760-61. Here, Bonaparte asserted the privilege as\na defendant and then sought to withdraw it, so the offensive use doctrine does not apply. In our\nanalysis, we turn to federal authority regarding when a defendant may withdraw the privilege,\ndue to the lack of Texas case law on the subject.\n\n                                               18\n\f“the relative weights of the parties’ competing interests [posed by an invocation of\nthe Fifth Amendment] with a view toward accommodating those interests, if\npossible.” Id. Accordingly, courts weigh the specific facts of each case in which a\ncivil litigant has attempted to withdraw his invocation of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege. Id.\n\n      Generally, courts should allow withdrawal of the privilege if the opposing\nparties will not suffer undue prejudice from the litigant’s earlier decision to invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment. Id. Conversely, withdrawal is not permitted if the litigant is\ntrying to abuse, manipulate or gain an unfair strategic advantage over opposing\nparties. Id. The timing and circumstances under which a litigant withdraws the\nprivilege are relevant factors in considering whether a litigant is attempting to\nabuse or gain some unfair advantage because withdrawing the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege at a late stage places the opposing party at a significant disadvantage\nfrom increased costs, delays, and the need for a new investigation. Id. at 547-48.\n\n      Bonaparte asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege twice during the\ndiscovery period and did not seek to withdraw it until eight days before trial. In\nwithdrawing the privilege at such a late stage, Bonaparte withheld information that\nPerry could have used in his investigation, only to provide information at the last\nmoment, leaving Perry at a disadvantage. See id. at 549 (holding defendant’s\nwithdrawal of Fifth Amendment privilege five days before end of discovery period\nwould put plaintiff at a disadvantage by leaving him less than a week to depose\ndefendant and conduct investigation).           Given Bonaparte’s eleventh-hour\nwithdrawal of the privilege long after the discovery period had closed, we are\nsatisfied that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in preventing Bonaparte\nfrom testifying at trial. See id.\n\n      Appellants nonetheless argue that Perry was required to file a motion to\n\n                                         19\n\fcompel Bonaparte’s testimony and obtain a ruling from the trial court to challenge\nBonaparte’s assertion of the privilege. Perry, however, did not challenge the\nassertion of the privilege; rather, he challenged Bonaparte’s withdrawal of the\nprivilege. Thus, the authority Bonaparte cites to support his argument that Perry\nwas required to challenge Bonaparte’s assertion of the privilege by filing a motion\nto compel and obtaining a ruling is inapposite.29 Instead, Bonaparte was required\nto timely amend or supplement his deposition testimony before he could testify at\ntrial as to any information withheld under his claim of privilege. See Tex. R. Civ.\nP. 193.4(c) (“A party may not use—at any hearing or trial—material or\ninformation withheld from discovery under a claim of privilege . . . without timely\namending or supplementing the party’s response to that discovery.”), 193.5\n(requiring party to supplement incomplete or incorrect discovery responses).

After the additional\ndiscount and segregation of fees, the total amount of attorneys’ fees sought before\na multiplier was $468,445.35 We conclude Perry presented evidence of how he\nsegregated fees as to liability for each claim by each party. We hold that the\nevidence supports a conclusion that Perry properly and adequately segregated\nattorneys’ fees as between his whistleblower and section 1983 claims under the\nstandard enunciated in Chapa. See 212 S.W.3d at 314 & n.83; see also Citizens\nNat’l Bank, 387 S.W.3d at 88.\n\n       We overrule appellants’ ninth issue.\n\n                                          Conclusion\n\n       We overrule appellants’ six issues challenging the judgment against them on\nPerry’s whistleblower and First Amendment claims. We do not reach appellants’\nissues involving the alternative judgment in favor of Perry on his Fourteenth\nAmendment claim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n                                             /s/     Martha Hill Jamison\n                                                     Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Christopher, Jamison, and Donovan.\n\n       35\n         Reed did not testify at the hearing on the motion for attorneys’ fees, but the trial court\ngave appellants an opportunity to cross-examine him. Appellants declined.\n\n                                                26\n\f</pre>",
