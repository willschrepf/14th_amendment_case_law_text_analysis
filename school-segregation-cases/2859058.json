Aside from attempting to destroy jail property, he also repeatedly\nand seriously attempted to harm himself. Over the course of ten days, Payette had to be\ntransported away from the jail to a hospital three times, first to remove a plastic razor he\n\n\n       *\n          After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is\nunnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. See FED. R. A PP. P.\n34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                              Page 2\n\nhad hidden in his anus, then because he swallowed a staple, and again because he\nswallowed a piece of metal from his cell sink. Although jail officials knew that the hospital\ntreating Payette had recommended that he receive mental health treatment, the jail\ndisregarded the recommendation. Instead, after Payette’s last trip to the hospital and until\nhe was transferred to a different facility seven days later, the jail immobilized him in leg,\nwrist, and waist restraints. According to Payette, the jail’s decision to disregard the\nhospital’s recommendation for mental health care and instead shackle him with painful\nrestraints, caused his mental health to deteriorate further, leading to loss of sleep, recurring\nnightmares, anxiety attacks, chest pains, and bouts of paranoia, all of which he continues to\nsuffer.\n\n        Payette brought this pro se action against several jail employees, alleging several\nconstitutional violations relating to the use of restraints and other conditions of his\nconfinement. The district court screened Payette’s complaint, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, and\nallowed him to proceed on his claims under the First and Eighth Amendments. After some\ndiscovery, appellees moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the\nmotion. Because the district court erred by not considering the evidence submitted by\nPayette that precludes summary judgment on some of his claims, we affirm in part, vacate\nin part, and remand.\n\n         We begin with a procedural point. The district court based its ruling only on facts\nsubmitted by the appellees, incorrectly believing that Payette “failed to submit any\nevidence which contradicts the affidavits submitted by the defendants.” While Payette did\nnot follow the usual method of submitting firsthand evidence—that is, filing a separate\naffidavit—he did assert facts in his complaint and in his response to appellees’ motion for\nsummary judgment. By declaring under penalty of perjury that the complaint and the\nresponse were true, Payette “converted” those filings into affidavits; accordingly, the\ndistrict court should have considered them evidence. See Dale v. Lappin, 376 F.3d 652, 655\n(7th Cir. 2004) (response to summary judgment motion); Ford v. Wilson, 90 F.3d 245, 247 (7th\nCir. 1996) (complaint). Appellees defend this part of the district court’s ruling by pointing\nto a district court’s discretion to treat one party’s proposed facts as undisputed when the\nother party does not comply with a local rule for motions related to summary judgment.\nSee, e.g., Cady v. Sheahan, 467 F.3d 1057, 1061 (7th Cir. 2006). But here the district court did\nnot invoke its discretion under local rules, and under similar circumstances, we have\nrefused to second-guess such a decision. Jessup v. Luther, 227 F.3d 993, 999 n.5 (7th Cir.\n2000); McGann v. Northeast Regional Commuter R.R. Corp., 8 F.3d 1174, 1178 n.3 (7th Cir.\n1993). In recounting the facts, then, we consider the entire summary judgment record, and\nas usual, we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Payette,\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                               Page 3\n\nand draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. See, e.g., Lewis v. School Dist. #70, 523 F.3d\n730, 741 (7th Cir. 2008).\n\n        Payette was housed at Marathon County Jail between March and October of 2006.\nAs we noted, he was a particularly difficult inmate and was subjected to a number of\nadministrative and disciplinary sanctions; he blames his behavior on severe depression that\nwas exacerbated by the conditions of which he complains. Specifically, in June, when jail\nofficials found Payette with a homemade rope made out of bed linens tied around his neck,\nthey moved him to a different cell to better observe him until an evaluation by the jail’s\nmental health provider cleared him as safe to return to his cell. In August, after Payette\nused a metal nail clipper to carve concrete from the walls in his cell, he was placed in\nadministrative segregation. In September, while still in administrative segregation, Payette\nand his cellmate used a homemade chisel to carve concrete from the walls in their cell.\n(Payette later pleaded guilty to criminal damage of property based on this incident.) In\nresponse, jail guards placed Payette in a cell with glass windows so that they could observe\nhim better. The next day, Payette broke a telephone in a visitation room and hid pieces of it\nin his waistband before guards searched him and discovered the pieces. While Payette was\nout of his cell, jail guards were searching his belongings and found a piece of metal that\nPayette had broken from a drinking fountain.\n\n        In response to Payette’s destructive behavior, Jail Administrator Bob Dickman\nordered him placed in restraints. A complete description of the restraints is not in the\nrecord, but both sides agree they included bindings of the legs, wrists, and waist. Payette\nreports that the restraints caused him constant pain and made it difficult for him to eat, use\nthe toilet, and sleep. According to appellees, Payette remained in restraints for five days.\n\n        Three days after the restraints were removed, Payette began a series of acts of self-\nmutilation. First, he slashed both his forearms with a sharpened staple. Jail guards\nconsidered the wound to be “superficial” and treated it with bandages, but Payette\ncounters that the wound was much worse; he says that he cut his arms open. Second,\nabout a week later, the guards gave Payette a plastic razor for shaving. After about 45\nminutes, Payette told guards that he had accidentally flushed the razor down the toilet, but\na strip search revealed that he had inserted a piece of the plastic razor in his anus, which\nrequired a trip to the hospital for removal. (Payette adds that the guards strip searched\nhim in a cell with a large glass window through which other inmates and guards of both\nsexes could see him.) Finally, Payette returned to the hospital twice more in the next ten\ndays, once because he said he swallowed a staple and again because he swallowed another\npiece of metal, this time from the sink in his cell.\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                             Page 4\n\n        During each hospital visit following Payette’s self-mutilating acts, doctors\nconsistently recommended that the jail furnish him with mental health treatment. Payette\nattached the records of these doctors’ recommendations to his brief in response to\nappellees’ motion for summary judgment, but because he did not authenticate them and\nbecause appellees objected to their use, they are not part of the summary judgment record.\nSee Scott v. Edinburg, 346 F.3d 752, 759 (7th Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, appellees themselves\nadmit that Jail Administrator Dickman knew about Payette’s self-inflicted injuries and\nknew that the hospital recommended that Payette see a forensic psychiatrist. Dickman did\nnot follow the recommendation. He asserts that he relied on advice that he had earlier\nreceived from the jail’s health care provider. That advice, which came two months before\nPayette’s repeated attempts at self-mutilation required three trips to the hospital, was that\nPayette could safely live in his cell.\n\n        Disregarding the fresh recommendation for mental health treatment provided after\nPayette’s self-inflicted injuries and hospital visits, Dickman ordered Payette to be placed in\nrestraints for another seven days until he was transferred to a different facility. Payette\nreports that because he was immobilized by the restraints, he had difficulty sleeping (a\nsituation exacerbated by the painful restraints, by a constantly illuminated light, and by the\njail’s decision not to allow him a blanket to protect against the cold) and suffered anxiety\nattacks. During one attack, guards came into his cell, removed his mattress, lifted him two\nor three feet in the air and dropped him onto the concrete slab that had held the mattress.\nPayette also reports that after he was placed in the restraints, he began to experience chest\npains, bouts of paranoia, sleeplessness, and nightmares.\n\n        The district court addressed five of Payette’s claims. We take them in turn. First,\nthe court held that Payette’s placement in restraints was not cruel and unusual punishment\nbecause Payette failed to show that it was done maliciously or sadistically. That is the\ncorrect test for excessive force claims brought under the Eighth Amendment, see Whitley v.\nAlbers, 475 U.S. 312, 321-22 (1986); Harper v. Albert, 400 F.3d 1052, 1065 (7th Cir. 2005), and\nPayette cannot satisfy it because he failed to produce evidence to rebut appellees’\nassertions that he was placed in restraints for the legitimate purpose of preventing him\nfrom harming jail property or himself.\n\n       By contrast, Payette can prove his second claim, that his conditions of confinement\nwere cruel and unusual, without showing malicious intent. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\n825, 837 (1994). Conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment if they deny an\ninmate the “minimal civilized measure of life's necessities” and prison officials act with\n“deliberate indifference,” to the conditions in question. Id. at 834; Townsend v. Fuchs, 522\nF.3d 765, 773 (7th Cir. 2008). “Deliberate indifference” means that prison officials know of\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                              Page 5\n\nand disregard an excessive risk to inmate health and safety. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\nShackling a prisoner based on a valid penological reason for a short period of time\nordinarily does not violate the constitution, see, e.g., Key v. McKinney, 176 F.3d 1083, 1086\n(8th Cir. 1999); Bruscino v. Carlson, 854 F.2d 162, 166 (7th Cir. 1988), but the seven days that\nPayette remained in restraints without mental health treatment after the hospital alerted\njail officials to his need for such treatment is evidence that jail officials disregarded a\nsignificant risk to his health. Indeed, the Eighth Circuit has recognized as clearly\nestablished that restraints on a psychiatric patient may be used only under close medical\nsupervision. Buckley v. Rogerson, 133 F.3d 1125, 1131 (8th Cir. 1998). Consistent with that\nholding, regulations requiring close medical supervision of prisoners placed in restraints\nfor more than a brief period of time have been adopted by the American Correctional\nAssociation, A MERICAN C ORRECTIONAL A SSOCIATION, STANDARDS FOR A DULT C ORRECTIONAL\nINSTITUTIONS at 52-53 (4th ed. 2003), the United States Bureau of Prisons, 28 C.F.R.\n§ 552.24(f), and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, W IS. A DMIN. C ODE DOC\n§ 306.11(3)(e). Notably, Wisconsin correctional institutions—Marathon County Jail is not\none, though—may not keep an inmate in restraints for more than twelve hours without a\npsychologist’s recommendation. Id.\n\n         Payette’s claim about the restraints is best conceptualized under the heading of\ndeliberate indifference to medical needs. The district court held that there was no evidence\nthat any of the appellees knew that Payette was at risk of serious harm or acted with\ncallous disregard to that risk because Payette received medical treatment following every\nincident of self-destructive behavior. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 837. But Payette did not\nreceive any mental health treatment even though Dickman knew that the hospital\nrecommended it after repeated episodes of self-mutilation. Appellees argue that they were\nnot required to follow the recommendations of the outside doctors because their own\ndoctors had made a different recommendation earlier. Indeed, “[a] difference of opinion as\nto how a condition should be treated does not give rise to a constitutional violation.”\nGarvin v. Armstrong, 236 F.3d 896, 898 (7th Cir. 2001). But the health care provider at the jail\nwho earlier determined that Payette was not at risk did so two months before he slashed\nhis arms, twice swallowed pieces of metal, and inserted part of a plastic razor into his anus,\nall of which necessitated three hospital visits. By disregarding the fresh advice for mental\nhealth treatment prompted by recent shocking behavior, and by using only painful\nrestraints to control a patient for whom mental health treatment was now recommended,\njail officials seriously imperiled Payette’s mental health. According to Payette, as a result of\nthe jail’s conduct, he has suffered from anxiety attacks, chest pains, nightmares,\nsleeplessness and bouts of paranoia following his release from the jail. On this record,\ntherefore, there is a genuine fact dispute over whether the appellees were deliberately\nindifferent to Payette’s mental health needs.\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                               Page 6\n\n        Payette has another, narrower, claim for deliberate indifference to his medical\nneeds—the medical treatment to his arms after he cut them with a staple—but the district\ncourt correctly granted summary judgment on that claim. After Payette used the staple to\ncut his forearms, he was bandaged by jail staff and not given further medical attention.\nPayette says that this treatment left him with permanent scars, but he does not suggest that\nthe scars could have been avoided by another treatment that the staff knew about and\nignored. To survive summary judgment on this claim, Payette needed to present evidence\nthat a different treatment would have resulted in less scarring, cf. Williams v. Liefer, 491 F.3d\n710, 714-15 (7th Cir. 2007) (plaintiff must provide verified medical evidence to show that a\ndelay in treatment harmed him), and he failed to do that.\n\n        The next claim that the district court addressed is Payette’s contention that he was\ndenied access to the courts because jail officials denied his requests to speak to his lawyer\nand would not allow him to have paper and pencil. Payette argues that his inability to\ncommunicate with his lawyer “allowed the defendants to continue to put [him] through\ninhumane conditions.” But he is challenging those conditions in court now and does not\nattest to any harm from the alleged denial of access that would require a remedy greater\nthan any remedy for his conditions-of-confinement claim. Thus, summary judgment on the\naccess-to-courts claim was proper. See Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415 (2002)\n(backward-looking access claim must “identify a remedy that may be awarded as\nrecompense but not otherwise available in some suit that may yet be brought”).\n\n        Finally, the district court held that Payette was not denied a reasonable opportunity\nto practice his religion when appellees denied him access to his bible because he failed to\nallege that “he needed a bible to practice his religious beliefs or what those beliefs were.”\nPutting this reasoning to the side, we affirm the district court’s ruling as to Payette’s\nreligious-freedom claim, first, because appellees did not target Payette’s religious practice;\nthey removed all books from his cell because they believed he had previously used a part of\na book to create a chisel. Thus, the bible was removed based on a rule of general\napplicability that did not target religious practice. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.\nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993). And even if removal of the bible were considered to\nbe an infringement on Payette’s freedom to exercise his religion, Payette has not rebutted\nappellees’ explanation that any infringement was reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interests. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987); Kaufman v. McCaughtry, 419\nF.3d 678, 682-83 (7th Cir. 2005).\n\n        Finally, the district court did not address Payette’s claim that the way jail guards\nsearched him for the missing plastic razor violated his Fourth and Eighth Amendment\nrights. At the screening stage, the district court did not mention the Fourth Amendment\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                               Page 7\n\nclaim so we assume it intended to dismiss that claim. In any event, we have held that\nprisoner strip-search claims are better addressed under the Eighth Amendment, see\nPeckham v. Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections, 141 F.3d 694, 697 (7th Cir. 1998), and the district\ncourt allowed Payette to proceed on his claims under the Eighth Amendment. Payette’s\nevidence—his verified observation—is that he was strip searched in front of a window in\nwhich everyone in the booking department, including inmates and officials of both sexes,\ncould see him. Payette does not contest the jail’s valid penological reason for searching\nhim; he contests the manner of the search. And his assertions create a triable dispute\nwhether the search was conducted \"in a harassing manner intended to humiliate and inflict\npsychological pain.\" Calhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir. 2003); cf. Fillmore v. Page,\n358 F.3d 496, 505 (7th Cir. 2004) (no constitutional violation when strip search was\nconducted “in a discreet and expeditious manner” in a cell that was out of view of other\ninmates).\n\n       Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of summary judgment as to the\nexcessive-force claim, access-to-courts claim, religious-freedom claim, and the claim of\ndeliberate indifference to medical needs regarding the bandaging of Payette’s arms. We\nVACATE the court’s grant of summary judgment on the other claims and REMAND for\nproceedings consistent with this order.\n\f",

P.\n34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                              Page 2\n\nhad hidden in his anus, then because he swallowed a staple, and again because he\nswallowed a piece of metal from his cell sink. Although jail officials knew that the hospital\ntreating Payette had recommended that he receive mental health treatment, the jail\ndisregarded the recommendation. Instead, after Payette’s last trip to the hospital and until\nhe was transferred to a different facility seven days later, the jail immobilized him in leg,\nwrist, and waist restraints. According to Payette, the jail’s decision to disregard the\nhospital’s recommendation for mental health care and instead shackle him with painful\nrestraints, caused his mental health to deteriorate further, leading to loss of sleep, recurring\nnightmares, anxiety attacks, chest pains, and bouts of paranoia, all of which he continues to\nsuffer.\n\n        Payette brought this pro se action against several jail employees, alleging several\nconstitutional violations relating to the use of restraints and other conditions of his\nconfinement. The district court screened Payette’s complaint, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, and\nallowed him to proceed on his claims under the First and Eighth Amendments. After some\ndiscovery, appellees moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the\nmotion. Because the district court erred by not considering the evidence submitted by\nPayette that precludes summary judgment on some of his claims, we affirm in part, vacate\nin part, and remand.\n\n         We begin with a procedural point. The district court based its ruling only on facts\nsubmitted by the appellees, incorrectly believing that Payette “failed to submit any\nevidence which contradicts the affidavits submitted by the defendants.” While Payette did\nnot follow the usual method of submitting firsthand evidence—that is, filing a separate\naffidavit—he did assert facts in his complaint and in his response to appellees’ motion for\nsummary judgment. By declaring under penalty of perjury that the complaint and the\nresponse were true, Payette “converted” those filings into affidavits; accordingly, the\ndistrict court should have considered them evidence.

Lappin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787033\"><a href=\"/opinion/787033/curtis-l-dale-v-harley-g-lappin/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 655\n(7th Cir. 2004) (response to summary judgment motion); Ford v.

See, e.g., Lewis v. School Dist. #70, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444104\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444104/lewis-v-school-dist-70/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (7th Cir. 2008).\n\n        Payette was housed at Marathon County Jail between March and October of 2006.\nAs we noted, he was a particularly difficult inmate and was subjected to a number of\nadministrative and disciplinary sanctions; he blames his behavior on severe depression that\nwas exacerbated by the conditions of which he complains. Specifically, in June, when jail\nofficials found Payette with a homemade rope made out of bed linens tied around his neck,\nthey moved him to a different cell to better observe him until an evaluation by the jail’s\nmental health provider cleared him as safe to return to his cell. In August, after Payette\nused a metal nail clipper to carve concrete from the walls in his cell, he was placed in\nadministrative segregation. In September, while still in administrative segregation, Payette\nand his cellmate used a homemade chisel to carve concrete from the walls in their cell.\n(Payette later pleaded guilty to criminal damage of property based on this incident.) In\nresponse, jail guards placed Payette in a cell with glass windows so that they could observe\nhim better. The next day, Payette broke a telephone in a visitation room and hid pieces of it\nin his waistband before guards searched him and discovered the pieces. While Payette was\nout of his cell, jail guards were searching his belongings and found a piece of metal that\nPayette had broken from a drinking fountain.\n\n        In response to Payette’s destructive behavior, Jail Administrator Bob Dickman\nordered him placed in restraints. A complete description of the restraints is not in the\nrecord, but both sides agree they included bindings of the legs, wrists, and waist. Payette\nreports that the restraints caused him constant pain and made it difficult for him to eat, use\nthe toilet, and sleep. According to appellees, Payette remained in restraints for five days.\n\n        Three days after the restraints were removed, Payette began a series of acts of self-\nmutilation. First, he slashed both his forearms with a sharpened staple. Jail guards\nconsidered the wound to be “superficial” and treated it with bandages, but Payette\ncounters that the wound was much worse; he says that he cut his arms open. Second,\nabout a week later, the guards gave Payette a plastic razor for shaving. After about 45\nminutes, Payette told guards that he had accidentally flushed the razor down the toilet, but\na strip search revealed that he had inserted a piece of the plastic razor in his anus, which\nrequired a trip to the hospital for removal. (Payette adds that the guards strip searched\nhim in a cell with a large glass window through which other inmates and guards of both\nsexes could see him.) Finally, Payette returned to the hospital twice more in the next ten\ndays, once because he said he swallowed a staple and again because he swallowed another\npiece of metal, this time from the sink in his cell.\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                             Page 4\n\n        During each hospital visit following Payette’s self-mutilating acts, doctors\nconsistently recommended that the jail furnish him with mental health treatment. Payette\nattached the records of these doctors’ recommendations to his brief in response to\nappellees’ motion for summary judgment, but because he did not authenticate them and\nbecause appellees objected to their use, they are not part of the summary judgment record.\nSee Scott v. Edinburg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783861\"><a href=\"/opinion/783861/perry-l-scott-sr-michelle-m-scott-phillip-h-scott-jr-v-rodney-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 759 (7th Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, appellees themselves\nadmit that Jail Administrator Dickman knew about Payette’s self-inflicted injuries and\nknew that the hospital recommended that Payette see a forensic psychiatrist. Dickman did\nnot follow the recommendation. He asserts that he relied on advice that he had earlier\nreceived from the jail’s health care provider. That advice, which came two months before\nPayette’s repeated attempts at self-mutilation required three trips to the hospital, was that\nPayette could safely live in his cell.\n\n        Disregarding the fresh recommendation for mental health treatment provided after\nPayette’s self-inflicted injuries and hospital visits, Dickman ordered Payette to be placed in\nrestraints for another seven days until he was transferred to a different facility. Payette\nreports that because he was immobilized by the restraints, he had difficulty sleeping (a\nsituation exacerbated by the painful restraints, by a constantly illuminated light, and by the\njail’s decision not to allow him a blanket to protect against the cold) and suffered anxiety\nattacks. During one attack, guards came into his cell, removed his mattress, lifted him two\nor three feet in the air and dropped him onto the concrete slab that had held the mattress.\nPayette also reports that after he was placed in the restraints, he began to experience chest\npains, bouts of paranoia, sleeplessness, and nightmares.\n\n        The district court addressed five of Payette’s claims. We take them in turn. First,\nthe court held that Payette’s placement in restraints was not cruel and unusual punishment\nbecause Payette failed to show that it was done maliciously or sadistically. That is the\ncorrect test for excessive force claims brought under the Eighth Amendment, see Whitley v.\nAlbers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321-22 (1986); Harper v.

See Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (1994). Conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment if they deny an\ninmate the “minimal civilized measure of life's necessities” and prison officials act with\n“deliberate indifference,” to the conditions in question.

Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\nShackling a prisoner based on a valid penological reason for a short period of time\nordinarily does not violate the constitution, see, e.g., Key v.

Indeed, the Eighth Circuit has recognized as clearly\nestablished that restraints on a psychiatric patient may be used only under close medical\nsupervision. Buckley v. Rogerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750647\"><a href=\"/opinion/750647/eddie-o-buckley-jr-v-russell-rogerson-warden-imcc-paul-w-loeffelholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1131 (8th Cir. 1998). Consistent with that\nholding, regulations requiring close medical supervision of prisoners placed in restraints\nfor more than a brief period of time have been adopted by the American Correctional\nAssociation, A MERICAN C ORRECTIONAL A SSOCIATION, STANDARDS FOR A DULT C ORRECTIONAL\nINSTITUTIONS at 52-53 (4th ed. 2003), the United States Bureau of Prisons, 28 C.F.R.\n§ 552.24(f), and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, W IS. A DMIN. C ODE DOC\n§ 306.11(3)(e). Notably, Wisconsin correctional institutions—Marathon County Jail is not\none, though—may not keep an inmate in restraints for more than twelve hours without a\npsychologist’s recommendation. Id.\n\n         Payette’s claim about the restraints is best conceptualized under the heading of\ndeliberate indifference to medical needs. The district court held that there was no evidence\nthat any of the appellees knew that Payette was at risk of serious harm or acted with\ncallous disregard to that risk because Payette received medical treatment following every\nincident of self-destructive behavior. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 837. But Payette did not\nreceive any mental health treatment even though Dickman knew that the hospital\nrecommended it after repeated episodes of self-mutilation. Appellees argue that they were\nnot required to follow the recommendations of the outside doctors because their own\ndoctors had made a different recommendation earlier. Indeed, “[a] difference of opinion as\nto how a condition should be treated does not give rise to a constitutional violation.”\nGarvin v. Armstrong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771644\"><a href=\"/opinion/771644/raymond-garvin-v-david-armstrong-dr-john-h-oberhelman-and-flora/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898 (7th Cir. 2001). But the health care provider at the jail\nwho earlier determined that Payette was not at risk did so two months before he slashed\nhis arms, twice swallowed pieces of metal, and inserted part of a plastic razor into his anus,\nall of which necessitated three hospital visits. By disregarding the fresh advice for mental\nhealth treatment prompted by recent shocking behavior, and by using only painful\nrestraints to control a patient for whom mental health treatment was now recommended,\njail officials seriously imperiled Payette’s mental health. According to Payette, as a result of\nthe jail’s conduct, he has suffered from anxiety attacks, chest pains, nightmares,\nsleeplessness and bouts of paranoia following his release from the jail. On this record,\ntherefore, there is a genuine fact dispute over whether the appellees were deliberately\nindifferent to Payette’s mental health needs.\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                               Page 6\n\n        Payette has another, narrower, claim for deliberate indifference to his medical\nneeds—the medical treatment to his arms after he cut them with a staple—but the district\ncourt correctly granted summary judgment on that claim. After Payette used the staple to\ncut his forearms, he was bandaged by jail staff and not given further medical attention.\nPayette says that this treatment left him with permanent scars, but he does not suggest that\nthe scars could have been avoided by another treatment that the staff knew about and\nignored. To survive summary judgment on this claim, Payette needed to present evidence\nthat a different treatment would have resulted in less scarring, cf. Williams v. Liefer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798203\"><a href=\"/opinion/798203/david-williams-v-james-liefer-brent-hoffman-and-james-massey/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714-15 (7th Cir. 2007) (plaintiff must provide verified medical evidence to show that a\ndelay in treatment harmed him), and he failed to do that.\n\n        The next claim that the district court addressed is Payette’s contention that he was\ndenied access to the courts because jail officials denied his requests to speak to his lawyer\nand would not allow him to have paper and pencil. Payette argues that his inability to\ncommunicate with his lawyer “allowed the defendants to continue to put [him] through\ninhumane conditions.” But he is challenging those conditions in court now and does not\nattest to any harm from the alleged denial of access that would require a remedy greater\nthan any remedy for his conditions-of-confinement claim. Thus, summary judgment on the\naccess-to-courts claim was proper. See Christopher v. Harbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (2002)\n(backward-looking access claim must “identify a remedy that may be awarded as\nrecompense but not otherwise available in some suit that may yet be brought”).\n\n        Finally, the district court held that Payette was not denied a reasonable opportunity\nto practice his religion when appellees denied him access to his bible because he failed to\nallege that “he needed a bible to practice his religious beliefs or what those beliefs were.”\nPutting this reasoning to the side, we affirm the district court’s ruling as to Payette’s\nreligious-freedom claim, first, because appellees did not target Payette’s religious practice;\nthey removed all books from his cell because they believed he had previously used a part of\na book to create a chisel. Thus, the bible was removed based on a rule of general\napplicability that did not target religious practice. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.\nCity of Hialeah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531 (1993). And even if removal of the bible were considered to\nbe an infringement on Payette’s freedom to exercise his religion, Payette has not rebutted\nappellees’ explanation that any infringement was reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interests. See Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1987); Kaufman v.

At the screening stage, the district court did not mention the Fourth Amendment\n\fNo. 07-3249                                                                               Page 7\n\nclaim so we assume it intended to dismiss that claim. In any event, we have held that\nprisoner strip-search claims are better addressed under the Eighth Amendment, see\nPeckham v. Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753022\"><a href=\"/opinion/753022/jane-peckham-v-wisconsin-department-of-corrections-patrick-j-fiedler/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 697 (7th Cir. 1998), and the district\ncourt allowed Payette to proceed on his claims under the Eighth Amendment. Payette’s\nevidence—his verified observation—is that he was strip searched in front of a window in\nwhich everyone in the booking department, including inmates and officials of both sexes,\ncould see him. Payette does not contest the jail’s valid penological reason for searching\nhim; he contests the manner of the search. And his assertions create a triable dispute\nwhether the search was conducted \"in a harassing manner intended to humiliate and inflict\npsychological pain.\" Calhoun v.
