Introduction\n\n      In four points, appellant R.C. appeals the trial court’s judgment for appellee\n\nS.G. We affirm in part and reverse and render in part.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\f                    II. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      Twenty-seven years after the parties’ 1986 divorce, and over a decade\n\nafter the parties’ youngest child, A.C., turned eighteen, S.G. instituted this action\n\nin the trial court to collect $139,976.43 in past-due child support.2 During the\n\nintervening years, S.G. made no attempt, either on her own or through the\n\nAttorney General of Texas, to collect any past due child support, even though the\n\ncourt-ordered payments had ceased decades earlier.          At the time this action\n\ncommenced, R.C. was employed as a laborer for the Nueces County Water\n\nDepartment, digging up and replacing broken water lines and receiving net\n\nearnings of $2,450.12 per month.\n\n      After R.C. failed to respond to S.G.’s application within the statutory time\n\nperiod, see Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 158.307 (West 2014), the trial court granted\n\nS.G.’s application and adjudicated the amount of child support arrearage to be\n\n$139,976.43 as of July 16, 2013. That order was set aside, however, when the\n\ntrial court granted R.C.’s motion for new trial, which was filed twenty-seven days\n\nafter the court’s order was signed.3\n\n      In S.G.’s supplemental response to the suit to challenge and correct the\n\nchild support arrearages and request for affirmative relief, S.G. asserted that in\n\n      2\n        The parties’ oldest child, M.C., was 35 years old at the time S.G. instituted\nthe action.\n      3\n       Prior to filing his motion for new trial and on the same day that the trial\ncourt signed the order granting S.G.’s application, R.C. filed a suit to challenge\nand correct child support arrearages.\n\n                                         2\n\fthe parties’ 1986 divorce decree, R.C. had been ordered to pay $65 per week in\n\nchild support through the Tarrant County Child Support Registry, to begin on\n\nJune 6, 1986. She attached the divorce decree to her supplemental response\n\nand incorporated it by reference.       S.G. also attached and incorporated by\n\nreference a record of child support payments maintained by the Tarrant County\n\nChild Support Registry showing that from June 19, 1986 to July 30, 1990, R.C.\n\nhad made payments totaling $11,886.40. And she attached and incorporated by\n\nreference what she referred to as “a complete payment record,” detailing a\n\npayment history through February 11, 2014, including payment due dates, actual\n\npayments, and interest calculations. The interest calculations were segregated\n\ninto three distinct time periods and set forth as follows: June 6, 1986–August 27,\n\n1993, calculated using a 10% annual interest rate and denoting a “Rate Change”\n\non September 1, 1991; September 3, 1993–December 28, 2001, calculated\n\nusing a 12% annual interest rate; and January 1, 2002–September 13, 2002,\n\ncalculated using a 6% annual interest rate. At the end of each of the three\n\nportions of the exhibit—identified by interest rate—S.G. set out an amortization\n\nschedule showing annual totals of the amount of child support due, the payments\n\nactually made, interest and principal, and the balance due, including a final total\n\nbalance of $142,832.93 ($82,747.80 in child support arrearages and $60,085.13\n\nin interest) as of February 11, 2014.\n\n      At the hearing on S.G.’s supplemental response, R.C. objected to S.G.’s\n\nExhibit 5, the same payment record described above, and to S.G.’s Exhibit 7,\n\n                                         3\n\fwhich was a payment record through November 3, 2014, showing a balance of\n\n$146,437.56 ($82,747.80 in child support arrearages and $63,689.76 in interest).\n\nThe trial court overruled his challenges and admitted these two exhibits.\n\n      R.C. then offered, and the trial court admitted, R.C.’s Exhibit 2, a certified\n\ncopy of the Tarrant County Child Support Office’s record showing that he owed\n\n$104,862.27 in cumulative arrearages through October 31, 2014 ($55,250 in\n\nchild support arrearages and $61,982.07 in accrued interest), and showing the\n\napplicable interest rate from June 6, 1986 to December 31, 2001 at 12% and\n\nfrom January 1, 2002 to September 16, 2002 at 6%.          Exhibit 2 also included a\n\n$483.40 payment made on October 17, 2013, which was not reflected in either of\n\nS.G.’s exhibits.   R.C. testified that he agreed with the Tarrant County Child\n\nSupport Office’s record of the arrearages as reflected in his Exhibit 2 and that he\n\nowed “a little over” $104,000 minus “any kind of possession credit . . . and direct\n\npayments.”4    R.C. also testified that he should not be responsible for S.G.’s\n\nattorney’s fees prior to the grant of the new trial and requested that the trial court\n\n\n\n\n      4\n        R.C. claimed that he had made some direct payments to S.G. that were\nnot accounted for, but his only evidence was a copy of a $300 check that his wife\nwrote to S.G. for “[A.C.] school” when A.C. was already eighteen years old. R.C.\nalso stated that he sought possession credit for the time M.C. lived with him, but\nM.C. was already eighteen during that time. The divorce decree provided for\nR.C. to make weekly child support payments “until the children attain the age of\neighteen (18) years or are otherwise emancipated.” M.C. turned eighteen years\nold in 1996 and A.C. turned eighteen years old in 2002. S.G. testified that she\nhad never seen any direct payments from R.C.\n\n                                          4\n\fset a structured payout schedule on the arrearages. The trial court sustained\n\nS.G.’s objection to the payout schedule request.\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, R.C.’s position was basically two-fold:\n\nthat the amount S.G. sought, at around $40,000 over the Tarrant County amount,\n\nwas unfair, and that given his age and financial circumstances, the trial court\n\nshould not garnish 50% of his income. Additionally, R.C. offered $97,000 to\n\nsatisfy the arrearage, stating that he and his wife would take out a home equity\n\nloan on her property as a down payment and then pay the rest in monthly\n\ninstallments for ten years.5\n\n      On November 10, 2014, the trial court signed a judgment for S.G. in the\n\namount of $146,437.56, plus interest, in addition to attorney’s fees and court\n\ncosts, payable through a judicial writ of withholding.\n\n                                  III. Discussion\n\n      In his first point, R.C. claims that the trial court based its $146,437.56\n\naward of past-due child support on an “in-house” calculation of child support\n\narrearages and interest prepared by S.G.’s attorney without receiving any\n\nevidence of the basis and reliability of the $146,437.56 figure. In his second\n\npoint, he challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support\n\nthe trial court’s arrearages determination. Assuming without deciding that S.G.’s\n\n\n\n\n      5\n       S.G. testified that R.C.’s proposal was unacceptable.\n\n                                          5\n\fexhibits were properly admitted, based on our analysis below, we conclude that\n\nR.C.’s sufficiency challenge has merit.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n      Most appealable issues in family law cases are evaluated for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Herzfeld v. Herzfeld, No. 05-10-01298-CV, 2012 WL 6061772, at *2\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas Dec. 6, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.). A trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion if the court acts without reference to any guiding rules or principles,\n\nthat is, if the act is arbitrary or unreasonable. Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609,\n\n614 (Tex. 2007); Cire v. Cummings, 134 S.W.3d 835, 838–39 (Tex. 2004). A trial\n\ncourt also abuses its discretion by ruling without supporting evidence.          Ford\n\nMotor Co. v. Garcia, 363 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tex. 2012). A trial court also abuses\n\nits discretion if it fails to analyze the law correctly or misapplies the law to\n\nestablished facts. Iliff v. Iliff, 339 S.W.3d 74, 78 (Tex. 2011).\n\n      In family law cases, the abuse of discretion standard of review overlaps\n\nwith the traditional sufficiency standard of review; as a result, legal and factual\n\nsufficiency are not independent grounds of error but are relevant factors in our\n\nassessment of whether the trial court abused its discretion. Herzfeld, 2012 WL\n\n6061772, at *2.     To determine whether the trial court abused its discretion\n\nbecause the evidence is insufficient to support its decision, we consider whether\n\nthe trial court (1) had sufficient evidence upon which to exercise its discretion and\n\n(2) erred in its exercise of that discretion.      Id.   We conduct the applicable\n\nsufficiency review with regard to the first question.       Id.     We then determine\n\n                                           6\n\fwhether, based on the elicited evidence, the trial court made a reasonable\n\ndecision. Id.\n\n      Regarding sufficiency of the evidence, we may sustain a legal sufficiency\n\nchallenge only when (1) the record discloses a complete absence of evidence of\n\na vital fact, (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving\n\nweight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact, (3) the evidence offered\n\nto prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla, or (4) the evidence\n\nestablishes conclusively the opposite of a vital fact. Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo,\n\n444 S.W.3d 616, 620 (Tex. 2014) (op. on reh’g); Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.\n\nMartinez, 977 S.W.2d 328, 334 (Tex. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1040 (1999).\n\nIn determining whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support the finding\n\nunder review, we must consider evidence favorable to the finding if a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could and disregard evidence contrary to the finding unless a\n\nreasonable factfinder could not. Cent. Ready Mix Concrete Co. v. Islas, 228\n\nS.W.3d 649, 651 (Tex. 2007); City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807, 827\n\n(Tex. 2005).\n\n      When reviewing an assertion that the evidence is factually insufficient to\n\nsupport a finding, we set aside the finding only if, after considering and weighing\n\nall of the evidence in the record pertinent to that finding, we determine that the\n\ncredible evidence supporting the finding is so weak, or so contrary to the\n\noverwhelming weight of all the evidence, that the answer should be set aside and\n\na new trial ordered. Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. 1986)\n\n                                        7\n\f(op. on reh’g); Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986); Garza v. Alviar,\n\n395 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex. 1965).\n\nB. Applicable Law on Child Support Interest\n\n      Family code section 157.265 governs accrual of interest on child support.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 157.265 (West 2014). A trial court has no discretion to\n\nmodify interest on child support arrearages, and in determining the amount of\n\naccrued interest, the court acts as a “mere scrivener” with no discretion to\n\ndeviate from the family code’s dictates. Herzfeld, 2012 WL 6061772, at *3.\n\n      Section 157.265 has been frequently amended since its inception in 1991,6\n\nbut it currently provides:\n\n             (a) Interest accrues on the portion of delinquent child support\n      that is greater than the amount of the monthly periodic support\n      obligation at the rate of six percent simple interest per year from the\n      date the support is delinquent until the date the support is paid or the\n      arrearages are confirmed and reduced to money judgment.\n\n            (b) Interest accrues on child support arrearages that have\n      been confirmed and reduced to money judgment as provided in this\n      subchapter at the rate of six percent simple interest per year from\n      the date the order is rendered until the date the judgment is paid.\n\n            (c) Interest accrues on a money judgment for retroactive or\n      lump-sum child support at the annual rate of six percent simple\n\n      6\n       See Act of May 23, 1991, 72nd Leg., R.S., ch. 467, §§ 1, 6, 1991 Tex.\nGen. Laws 1693, 1693, 1695, amended by Act of May 6, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S.,\nch. 150, §§ 1, 3, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 302, 302, amended by Act of May 24,\n1999, 76th Leg., R.S., ch. 943, §§ 1, 3, 1999 Tex.

Laws 5294, 5294–95, amended by Act of May 12, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S.,\nch. 185, §§ 1–2, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 339, 339 (current version at Tex. Fam.\nCode Ann. § 157.265).\n\n                                         8\n\f      interest from the date the order is rendered until the judgment is\n      paid.\n\n           (d) Subsection (a) applies to a child support payment that\n      becomes due on or after January 1, 2002.\n\n            (e) Child support arrearages in existence on January 1, 2002,\n      that were not confirmed and reduced to a money judgment on or\n      before that date accrue interest as follows:\n\n                  (1) before January 1, 2002, the arrearages are subject\n            to the interest rate that applied to the arrearages before that\n            date; and\n\n                  (2) on and after January 1, 2002, the cumulative total of\n            arrearages and interest accumulated on those arrearages\n            described by Subdivision (1) is subject to Subsection (a).\n\n             (f) Subsections (b) and (c) apply to a money judgment for child\n      support rendered on or after January 1, 2002. A money judgment\n      for child support rendered before that date is governed by the law in\n      effect on the date the judgment was rendered, and the former law is\n      continued in effect for that purpose.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 157.265 (emphasis added); see also In re M.C.C., 187\n\nS.W.3d 383, 385 (Tex. 2006) (holding that the 2001 amendment did not indicate\n\nlegislative intent to make it retroactive; as of January 1, 2002, unpaid child\n\nsupport that had not been judicially confirmed, including the 12% interest already\n\nincluded in the debt, would start accruing any new interest at the rate of 6%).\n\n      Before September 1, 1991, Texas common law favored the award of\n\nprejudgment interest for delinquent child support based on the reasoning that an\n\nascertainable sum of money could be determined to have been due and payable\n\nat a date certain prior to judgment. Castle v. Harris, 960 S.W.2d 140, 143–44\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1997, no writ). As observed in O’Connor’s Family\n\n                                         9\n\fLaw Handbook, “It is unclear, however, whether the interest that accrues on\n\nunconfirmed child support during this period should be characterized as\n\nprejudgment or postjudgment interest.” Joan Foote Jenkins & Randall B. Wilhite,\n\nO’Connor’s Texas Family Law Handbook 1102, 1103–04 (2015) (noting that the\n\napplicable interest rate during this time period, if characterized as common law\n\nprejudgment interest, would be governed by a variety of rules, including those\n\ngoverning compounding versus simple interest, and if characterized as\n\npostjudgment interest, would be governed by the revised civil statute article and\n\ninterpretive case law in effect at the time).\n\n      On September 1, 1991, the legislature added section 157.265’s\n\npredecessor, providing for prejudgment interest to accrue on unpaid child support\n\nobligations “at the rate of ten percent a year computed monthly.” Act of May 23,\n\n1991, 72nd Leg., R.S., ch. 467, §§ 1, 6, 1991 Tex. Gen. Laws 1693, 1693, 1695\n\n(emphasis added); Castle, 960 S.W.2d at 142, 144.               But a subsequent\n\namendment, effective September 1, 1993, changed the rate to 12% simple\n\ninterest per year.7 Act of May 6, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 150, §§ 1, 3, 1993\n\nTex. Gen. Laws at 302; Castle, 960 S.W.2d at 142–43. “The 1993 amendment,\n\n      7\n        The 1993 amendment also deleted the word “prejudgment,” added\n“delinquent,” and provided that the interest would accrue from the date the\nsupport was delinquent until the date it was paid, regardless of whether the\namount had been reduced to judgment by the court. Act of May 6, 1993, 73rd\nLeg., R.S., ch. 150, § 1, sec. 14.34(a), 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws at 302. As pertinent\nhere, it defined “delinquent” payment as “if the payment is not received by the\nobligee, registry, or entity specified in the child support order before the 31st day\nafter the payment date stated in the order.” Id. § 1, sec. 14.34(b).\n\n                                          10\n\fwhich raise[d] the statutory interest rate from ten percent to twelve percent,\n\n‘reache[d] back’ and applie[d] to arrears due and owing on September 1, 1991.”\n\nIn re W.G.S., 107 S.W.3d 624, 629 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.).\n\nThat is, the statute as enacted and made effective on September 1, 1993, stated:\n\n             This Act applies to child support payments due on or after\n      September 1, 1991, and any accrued arrears which were owing on\n      or after September 1, 1991, in:\n\n                   (1) an action commenced on or after the effective date\n            of this Act; or\n\n                   (2) a new trial or retrial following appeal of the trial\n            court’s judgment in an action commenced before the effective\n            date of this Act.\n\nAct of May 6, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 150, §§ 1, 3(b), 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws at\n\n302 (emphasis added). Therefore, as of September 1, 1993, the interest rate for\n\ndelinquent child support from September 1, 1991 until December 31, 2001, was\n\n12% per year. See Act of May 6, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 150, §§ 1, 3(b), 1993\n\nTex. Gen. Laws at 302; Jenkins & Wilhite, O’Connor’s Texas Family Law\n\nHandbook at 1104.\n\n      In 1999, the legislature modified when interest would begin to accrue on\n\nthe portion of delinquent child support “that is greater than the amount of the\n\nmonthly periodic support obligation” at 12% simple interest per year. Act of May\n\n24, 1999, 76th Leg., R.S., ch. 943, § 1, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws at 3679. In 2001,\n\nthe legislature amended the statute to reflect a 6% simple interest rate per year.\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\fAct of May 25, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 1491, §§ 1, 3, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws at\n\n5294–95.8\n\n      The legislature amended the statute again in 2005 to add subsections (d)\n\nthrough (f) and to address the split in the courts regarding whether the 2001\n\ninterest rate change from 12% to 6% was to apply only prospectively or also\n\nretroactively. See Act of May 12, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 185, §§ 1–2, 2005\n\nTex. Gen. Laws at 339; House Comm. on Jurisprudence, Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B.\n\n      8\n        In contrast to the 1993 amendment, in M.C.C., the supreme court\nconcluded that the 2001 amendment was to be prospectively applied only,\nbecause the effective date language “merely state[d] the amending date and then\ndefine[d] the types of support to which the new six percent rate applie[d] without\nany suggestion of retroactive application.” 187 S.W.3d at 384–85 (quoting\ngovernment code section 311.022 for the proposition that a statute is presumed\nto be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retroactive and stating\nthat statutes are only applied retroactively if the statutory language indicates that\nthe legislature intended that the statute be retroactive). The 2001 amendment\nstated:\n\n      The change in law made by this Act applies only to:\n\n             (1) a child support payment that becomes due on or after the\n      effective date of this Act; and\n\n             (2) unpaid child support that became due before the effective\n      date of this Act and for which a court has not confirmed the amount\n      of arrearages and rendered a money judgment.\n\nAct of May 25, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 1491, § 3, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws at\n5295. This was unlike the language in the 1993 amendment, which expressly\nreached backward by two years in setting out the circumstances to which the law\napplied. See Act of May 6, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 150, §§ 1, 3(b), 1993 Tex.\nGen. Laws at 302; W.G.S., 107 S.W.3d at 629–30 (observing that procedural or\nremedial laws that do not disturb vested rights can apply retroactively and that\napplying statute to a parent who failed to pay child support involved no vested\nright).\n\n                                         12\n\f678,        79th        Leg.,         R.S.        (2005),        available         at\n\nhttp://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/srcBillAnalyses/79-0/HB678.pdf      (last   visited\n\nMay 6, 2016). House Bill 678 “clarifie[d] the application of the effective date of\n\nth[e] amendment by providing that any unpaid child support that accrued before\n\nJanuary 1, 2002, accrued at the interest rate in effect at the time the child support\n\npayment became delinquent.” House Comm. on Jurisprudence, Bill Analysis,\n\nTex. H.B. 678, 79th Leg., R.S. (2005). Therefore, all of the arrearages from\n\nJanuary 1, 2002 onward and the interest accumulated on the cumulative total\n\nshould have been calculated using the 6% annual interest rate, while the\n\narrearages and interest accruing before January 1, 2002 were subject to section\n\n157.265’s predecessors. See id.\n\nC. Evidence\n\n       In addition to the payment records at issue in S.G.’s Exhibits 5 and 7, the\n\ntrial court heard testimony from R.C. that the Tarrant County payment history\n\ncontained all of the child support payments that he had made and his admission\n\nthat he owed unpaid child support and arrearages in the amount of “a little over”\n\n$104,000 as reflected on the Tarrant County Child Support Office’s records. The\n\ntrial court also heard testimony from S.G. that she stopped receiving child\n\nsupport payments approximately four years after the divorce and had received no\n\ndirect payments. Based on the children’s ages at the time of the divorce in June\n\n1986, R.C. was obligated to make approximately 16 years of child support\n\npayments, ending in September 2002 (over 832 payments of $65 each, totaling\n\n                                         13\n\fmore than $50,000 before interest) but according to his exhibit from Tarrant\n\nCounty, he paid only $12,369.80. Based on the evidence provided, and viewed\n\nin its most favorable light, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\n\nR.C. owed unpaid child support and interest, and that the amount he owed was\n\nat least the amount reflected in the Tarrant County record and to which he\n\nstipulated: $104,862.27.\n\n      However, although S.G.’s exhibits show that the interest rate changed to\n\n10% on September 1, 1991, they are silent as to what rate, if any, applied prior to\n\nSeptember 1, 1991.9 Cf. Act of May 23, 1991, 72nd Leg., R.S., ch. 467, §§ 1, 6,\n\n1991 Tex. Gen. Laws at 1695 (stating that the Act took effect on September 1,\n\n1991, and applied to child support due and owing after the statute’s effective\n\ndate); Castle, 960 S.W.2d at 143–44 (stating that before September 1, 1991,\n\nTexas common law favored the award of prejudgment interest for delinquent\n\nchild support payments).\n\n      Further, the portion of S.G.’s exhibits referencing the June 6, 1986 to\n\nAugust 27, 1993 time period merely states at the top of the first page, “Nominal\n\nAnnual Rate . . . :        10.000%,” even though, as set out above, the 1993\n\namendment to the statute “reache[d] back” and applied a 12% simple interest\n\nrate per year to arrears due and owing on September 1, 1991, in addition to\n\n\n\n      9\n       R.C. stopped making regular child support payments in 1986, the first\nyear that the order went into effect.\n\n                                        14\n\fchanging the rate from a monthly calculation.10 See W.G.S., 107 S.W.3d at 629;\n\nJenkins & Wilhite, O’Connor’s Texas Family Law Handbook at 1104. Nothing in\n\nS.G.’s exhibits reflects either change. Instead, the top of the second portion of\n\nS.G.’s exhibits, reflecting the date range September 3, 1993 to December 31,\n\n2001, states, “Nominal Annual Rate . . . :        12.000%,” ignoring the statutory\n\nrequirement of application from September 1, 1991.\n\n      Further, S.G.’s exhibits do not show the actual calculations used, making it\n\nimpossible for this court to determine how the numbers provided in the exhibits\n\nwere calculated, including the $40,000 difference between S.G.’s exhibits and\n\nR.C.’s exhibit.   See Chenault v. Banks, 296 S.W.3d 186, 192 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.) (“Simply put, we cannot find any way, based\n\non the evidence presented, to support the trial court’s child support arrearages\n\ncalculation.”).   Although R.C. offered no evidence beyond the interest rates\n\nstated in his exhibit to controvert the interest rates recited in S.G.’s exhibits, R.C.\n\ndid not bear the burden of proof on this point. Consequently, because S.G.\n\nfailed to show the correct interest rate as applied, her exhibits were legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court’s award beyond $104,862.27, the\n\namount to which R.C. stipulated.         Because the trial court lacked sufficient\n\n\n\n\n      10\n         In contrast, R.C.’s copy of the Tarrant County record shows a 12%\ninterest rate from June 6, 1986 to December 31, 2001, but it also fails to show\nany interest calculations used in reaching the $104,862.27 figure.\n\n                                          15\n\fevidence upon which to exercise its discretion, we sustain part of R.C.’s second\n\npoint and render judgment for S.G. in the amount of $104,862.27.\n\nD. Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In his third point, R.C. argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding attorney’s fees that were incurred in securing S.G.’s default judgment,\n\nwhich was later set aside by the granting of his motion for new trial. Without\n\ncitation to authority, R.C. asserts that “[t]he granting of the Motion for New Trial\n\nshould have legally voided all the legal work performed in securing the default\n\njudgment.”11 See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n\n\n      11\n        S.G. responds that the award of attorney’s fees was mandatory under\nsection 157.167(a). Family code section 157.167(a) provides, “If the court finds\nthat the respondent has failed to make child support payments, the court shall\norder the respondent to pay the movant’s reasonable attorney’s fees and all court\ncosts in addition to the arrearages.” Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 157.167(a) (West\n2014). When the trial court finds in a child-support enforcement action that the\nobligor has failed to make child support payments, it has no discretion but to\norder the obligor to pay the obligee’s reasonable attorney’s fees unless it also\nfinds that there is good cause for the failure to pay. See id. § 157.167(c); Remley\nv. Remley, No. 02-07-00044-CV, 2008 WL 4355347, at *9 (Tex. App.—Fort\nWorth Sept. 25, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n       Further, R.C.’s argument that the granting of a new trial “legally voided all\nthe legal work performed in securing the default judgment” is simply not a correct\nstatement of the law. See Dir., State Employees Workers’ Compensation Div. v.\nEvans, 889 S.W.2d 266, 270 n.3 (Tex. 1994) (stating that the willingness of a\nparty to go to trial immediately and pay the expenses of the default judgment are\nimportant factors for the court to look to in determining whether it should grant a\nnew trial); Sw. Warren, Inc. v. Crawford, 464 S.W.3d 822, 831 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.) (stating that appellants’ offer to reimburse\nappellee for the attorney’s fees she incurred in obtaining her default judgment\nwas sufficient to rebut appellee’s claim of financial hardship); see also L’Arte de\nla Mode, Inc. v. The Neiman Marcus Grp., 395 S.W.3d 291, 298 (Tex. App.—\nDallas 2013, no pet.) (“The trial court may not deny the motion for new trial based\n                                        16\n\f      On September 24, 2013, R.C. filed a motion for new trial, seeking to set\n\naside the default judgment that had been entered against him on August 28,\n\n2013. R.C.’s motion met the Craddock12 test in that it: (1) alleged that he had\n\nused diligence and that his failure to answer was the result of a mistake, not\n\nconscious indifference, (2) alleged that he had meritorious defenses, and (3)\n\nalleged that the setting aside of the default judgment would not prejudice S.G.\n\nSee Dolgencorp of Tex., Inc. v. Lerma, 288 S.W.3d 922, 925 (Tex. 2009)\n\n(reciting Craddock test’s three elements); In re B.Q.S., No. 11-13-00043-CV,\n\n2014 WL 2957451, at *8–11 (Tex. App.—Eastland June 26, 2014, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (applying Craddock when trial court entered a default order of parentage and\n\nordered appellant to pay child support and retroactive child support).\n\n      In addressing the third prong of the Craddock test, R.C.’s motion stated,\n\n“[R.C.] stands ready to pay any costs associated with the taking of the default\n\njudgment.” Having agreed to pay costs associated with the taking of the default\n\njudgment, R.C. cannot now complain on appeal that the reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees associated with the taking of the default judgment\n\nshould not have been included in the judgment.13 See Johnson v. Harris Cty.,\n\n\n\nsolely on the plaintiff’s unsupported allegations that the defendant will not keep\nits promise to pay the plaintiff’s costs and expenses in obtaining the default\njudgment.”).\n      12\n        Craddock v. Sunshine Bus Lines, Inc., 133 S.W.2d 124, 126 (Tex. 1939).\n      13\n        R.C. claimed in his motion for new trial that he received no notice of the\napplication for judicial writ of withholding but also stated that “[u]pon receipt of the\n                                          17\n\fNo. 01-14-00383-CV, 2015 WL 3485913, at *2 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\nJune 2, 2015, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (holding that a party cannot complain on\n\nappeal that the trial court ordered the action that the party requested).         We\n\noverrule R.C.’s third point.\n\nE. Payout Schedule\n\n      In his final point, R.C. argues that the trial court should have used its equity\n\npowers to establish a payout schedule on the arrearage judgment because after\n\nit entered judgment, S.G. issued a wage assignment “[a]t the first opportunity” to\n\ngarnish more than his net monthly salary. However, in cases in which a trial\n\ncourt has created a payout schedule, the payout schedule’s presence cannot\n\nprevent execution on a judgment for arrearages—it merely gives the obligee an\n\nadditional permissible option for collecting what he or she is entitled to receive\n\nNotice of Application of Judicial Writ of Withholding,” he called S.G.’s attorney\nand voiced his objection, then hired an attorney in Corpus Christi who failed to\nfile an answer or contest the pending court action. R.C. then hired his instant\ncounsel to assist him. R.C. asserted in his motion for new trial, “The failure of the\nRespondent to file a contest before judgment was a mistake or accident caused\nby his failure to receive the proper information from the Petitioner’s attorney and\ncoordination problems between attorneys.” [Emphasis added.] S.G. filed a\nresponse to the motion, claiming that R.C. was properly served with the notice of\napplication for judicial writ of withholding, and she attached an affidavit by the law\nfirm employee who prepared the notice of application for judicial writ of\nwithholding and a green card to show receipt of the notice. S.G. stated in her\nresponse that she had had to hire a lawyer to represent her and prayed for her\n“reasonable attorney’s fees for this case.” At the November 2014 hearing, when\nR.C.’s attorney stated that the trial court had ruled that S.G.’s lawyer “did these\nthings without proper notice to them,” the trial court responded, “Well, the Court\nfound no such thing, but—the Court just set aside a default judgment. That’s all\nthe Court did. . . . [Y]ou’re attributing findings to this Court this Court never\nmade.”\n\n                                         18\n\funder the judgment. In re R.C.T., 294 S.W.3d 238, 243 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (op. on reh’g) (“The existence of a payout\n\nschedule does not preclude Lynn (or the Attorney General) from utilizing any\n\navailable collection efforts, such as a child-support lien.”); In re Dryden, 52\n\nS.W.3d 257, 262–63 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2001, orig. proceeding)\n\n(granting relief when trial court did not have authority to preclude relator from\n\nattempting to collect judgment for arrearages by method other than payout\n\nschedule).    Therefore, even if the trial court abused its discretion by not\n\nestablishing a payout schedule, neither its presence nor absence could have an\n\neffect on S.G.’s decision to pursue any of the collection options available to her. 14\n\nWe overrule R.C.’s final point.\n\n\n      14\n         Further, family code section 158.007 addresses the limited basis\navailable to the trial court to create a payout schedule, stating that if the court\n“finds that the schedule for discharging arrearages would cause the obligor, the\nobligor’s family, or children for whom support is due from the obligor to suffer\nunreasonable hardship, the court . . . may extend the payment period for a\nreasonable length of time.” Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 158.007 (West 2014); see In\nre D.C., 180 S.W.3d 647, 653 (Tex. App.—Waco 2005, no pet.) (reversing trial\ncourt’s judgment when record did not provide adequate factual basis to support\ntrial court’s implied finding of “unreasonable hardship” and decision to allow\nfather to pay off his arrearages over a period of more than two years). The trial\ncourt here implicitly found that its order without a payout schedule would not work\nan unreasonable hardship, and as it was the sole judge of the witnesses’\ncredibility and the weight to be given their testimony, see Golden Eagle Archery,\nInc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003), we cannot say that it abused\nits discretion merely because we might have ruled differently in the same\ncircumstances. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549,\n558 (Tex. 1995); see also Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 620 (Tex. 2007). R.C.\nacknowledges that he “cannot cite any existing case law” to support the\nproposition that the trial court abuses its discretion by granting to a petitioner the\nautomatic remedies available under the family code when an arrearage is\n                                         19\n\f                                 IV. Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled R.C.’s third and fourth points, we affirm the portion of the\n\ntrial court’s judgment pertaining to S.G.’s attorney’s fees billed in connection with\n\nthe default judgment and the payout schedule. But having sustained part of\n\nR.C.’s second point based on the legal and factual insufficiency of the evidence\n\nto support more than the amount to which R.C. stipulated, we reverse the\n\namount of child support arrearages stated in the trial court’s judgment and render\n\njudgment for S.G. in the amount to which R.C. stipulated, $104,862.27.\n\n\n                                                    /s/ Bonnie Sudderth\n                                                    BONNIE SUDDERTH\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: WALKER, MEIER, and SUDDERTH, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: May 12, 2016\n\n\n\n\nreduced to judgment.

App. P. 47.4.\n\f                    II. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      Twenty-seven years after the parties’ 1986 divorce, and over a decade\n\nafter the parties’ youngest child, A.C., turned eighteen, S.G. instituted this action\n\nin the trial court to collect $139,976.43 in past-due child support.2 During the\n\nintervening years, S.G. made no attempt, either on her own or through the\n\nAttorney General of Texas, to collect any past due child support, even though the\n\ncourt-ordered payments had ceased decades earlier.          At the time this action\n\ncommenced, R.C. was employed as a laborer for the Nueces County Water\n\nDepartment, digging up and replacing broken water lines and receiving net\n\nearnings of $2,450.12 per month.\n\n      After R.C. failed to respond to S.G.’s application within the statutory time\n\nperiod, see Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 158.307 (West 2014), the trial court granted\n\nS.G.’s application and adjudicated the amount of child support arrearage to be\n\n$139,976.43 as of July 16, 2013. That order was set aside, however, when the\n\ntrial court granted R.C.’s motion for new trial, which was filed twenty-seven days\n\nafter the court’s order was signed.3\n\n      In S.G.’s supplemental response to the suit to challenge and correct the\n\nchild support arrearages and request for affirmative relief, S.G. asserted that in\n\n      2\n        The parties’ oldest child, M.C., was 35 years old at the time S.G. instituted\nthe action.\n      3\n       Prior to filing his motion for new trial and on the same day that the trial\ncourt signed the order granting S.G.’s application, R.C. filed a suit to challenge\nand correct child support arrearages.\n\n                                         2\n\fthe parties’ 1986 divorce decree, R.C. had been ordered to pay $65 per week in\n\nchild support through the Tarrant County Child Support Registry, to begin on\n\nJune 6, 1986. She attached the divorce decree to her supplemental response\n\nand incorporated it by reference.       S.G. also attached and incorporated by\n\nreference a record of child support payments maintained by the Tarrant County\n\nChild Support Registry showing that from June 19, 1986 to July 30, 1990, R.C.\n\nhad made payments totaling $11,886.40. And she attached and incorporated by\n\nreference what she referred to as “a complete payment record,” detailing a\n\npayment history through February 11, 2014, including payment due dates, actual\n\npayments, and interest calculations. The interest calculations were segregated\n\ninto three distinct time periods and set forth as follows: June 6, 1986–August 27,\n\n1993, calculated using a 10% annual interest rate and denoting a “Rate Change”\n\non September 1, 1991; September 3, 1993–December 28, 2001, calculated\n\nusing a 12% annual interest rate; and January 1, 2002–September 13, 2002,\n\ncalculated using a 6% annual interest rate. At the end of each of the three\n\nportions of the exhibit—identified by interest rate—S.G. set out an amortization\n\nschedule showing annual totals of the amount of child support due, the payments\n\nactually made, interest and principal, and the balance due, including a final total\n\nbalance of $142,832.93 ($82,747.80 in child support arrearages and $60,085.13\n\nin interest) as of February 11, 2014.\n\n      At the hearing on S.G.’s supplemental response, R.C. objected to S.G.’s\n\nExhibit 5, the same payment record described above, and to S.G.’s Exhibit 7,\n\n                                         3\n\fwhich was a payment record through November 3, 2014, showing a balance of\n\n$146,437.56 ($82,747.80 in child support arrearages and $63,689.76 in interest).\n\nThe trial court overruled his challenges and admitted these two exhibits.\n\n      R.C. then offered, and the trial court admitted, R.C.’s Exhibit 2, a certified\n\ncopy of the Tarrant County Child Support Office’s record showing that he owed\n\n$104,862.27 in cumulative arrearages through October 31, 2014 ($55,250 in\n\nchild support arrearages and $61,982.07 in accrued interest), and showing the\n\napplicable interest rate from June 6, 1986 to December 31, 2001 at 12% and\n\nfrom January 1, 2002 to September 16, 2002 at 6%.          Exhibit 2 also included a\n\n$483.40 payment made on October 17, 2013, which was not reflected in either of\n\nS.G.’s exhibits.   R.C. testified that he agreed with the Tarrant County Child\n\nSupport Office’s record of the arrearages as reflected in his Exhibit 2 and that he\n\nowed “a little over” $104,000 minus “any kind of possession credit . . . and direct\n\npayments.”4    R.C. also testified that he should not be responsible for S.G.’s\n\nattorney’s fees prior to the grant of the new trial and requested that the trial court\n\n\n\n\n      4\n        R.C. claimed that he had made some direct payments to S.G. that were\nnot accounted for, but his only evidence was a copy of a $300 check that his wife\nwrote to S.G. for “[A.C.] school” when A.C. was already eighteen years old. R.C.\nalso stated that he sought possession credit for the time M.C. lived with him, but\nM.C. was already eighteen during that time. The divorce decree provided for\nR.C. to make weekly child support payments “until the children attain the age of\neighteen (18) years or are otherwise emancipated.” M.C. turned eighteen years\nold in 1996 and A.C. turned eighteen years old in 2002. S.G. testified that she\nhad never seen any direct payments from R.C.\n\n                                          4\n\fset a structured payout schedule on the arrearages. The trial court sustained\n\nS.G.’s objection to the payout schedule request.\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, R.C.’s position was basically two-fold:\n\nthat the amount S.G. sought, at around $40,000 over the Tarrant County amount,\n\nwas unfair, and that given his age and financial circumstances, the trial court\n\nshould not garnish 50% of his income. Additionally, R.C. offered $97,000 to\n\nsatisfy the arrearage, stating that he and his wife would take out a home equity\n\nloan on her property as a down payment and then pay the rest in monthly\n\ninstallments for ten years.5\n\n      On November 10, 2014, the trial court signed a judgment for S.G. in the\n\namount of $146,437.56, plus interest, in addition to attorney’s fees and court\n\ncosts, payable through a judicial writ of withholding.\n\n                                  III. Discussion\n\n      In his first point, R.C. claims that the trial court based its $146,437.56\n\naward of past-due child support on an “in-house” calculation of child support\n\narrearages and interest prepared by S.G.’s attorney without receiving any\n\nevidence of the basis and reliability of the $146,437.56 figure. In his second\n\npoint, he challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support\n\nthe trial court’s arrearages determination. Assuming without deciding that S.G.’s\n\n\n\n\n      5\n       S.G. testified that R.C.’s proposal was unacceptable.\n\n                                          5\n\fexhibits were properly admitted, based on our analysis below, we conclude that\n\nR.C.’s sufficiency challenge has merit.\n\nA.

See Act of May 6, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 150, §§ 1, 3(b), 1993 Tex.\nGen. Laws at 302; W.G.S., 107 S.W.3d at 629–30 (observing that procedural or\nremedial laws that do not disturb vested rights can apply retroactively and that\napplying statute to a parent who failed to pay child support involved no vested\nright).\n\n                                         12\n\f678,        79th        Leg.,         R.S.        (2005),        available         at\n\nhttp://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/srcBillAnalyses/79-0/HB678.pdf      (last   visited\n\nMay 6, 2016). House Bill 678 “clarifie[d] the application of the effective date of\n\nth[e] amendment by providing that any unpaid child support that accrued before\n\nJanuary 1, 2002, accrued at the interest rate in effect at the time the child support\n\npayment became delinquent.” House Comm. on Jurisprudence, Bill Analysis,\n\nTex. H.B. 678, 79th Leg., R.S. (2005). Therefore, all of the arrearages from\n\nJanuary 1, 2002 onward and the interest accumulated on the cumulative total\n\nshould have been calculated using the 6% annual interest rate, while the\n\narrearages and interest accruing before January 1, 2002 were subject to section\n\n157.265’s predecessors. See id.\n\nC. Evidence\n\n       In addition to the payment records at issue in S.G.’s Exhibits 5 and 7, the\n\ntrial court heard testimony from R.C. that the Tarrant County payment history\n\ncontained all of the child support payments that he had made and his admission\n\nthat he owed unpaid child support and arrearages in the amount of “a little over”\n\n$104,000 as reflected on the Tarrant County Child Support Office’s records. The\n\ntrial court also heard testimony from S.G. that she stopped receiving child\n\nsupport payments approximately four years after the divorce and had received no\n\ndirect payments. Based on the children’s ages at the time of the divorce in June\n\n1986, R.C. was obligated to make approximately 16 years of child support\n\npayments, ending in September 2002 (over 832 payments of $65 each, totaling\n\n                                         13\n\fmore than $50,000 before interest) but according to his exhibit from Tarrant\n\nCounty, he paid only $12,369.80. Based on the evidence provided, and viewed\n\nin its most favorable light, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\n\nR.C. owed unpaid child support and interest, and that the amount he owed was\n\nat least the amount reflected in the Tarrant County record and to which he\n\nstipulated: $104,862.27.\n\n      However, although S.G.’s exhibits show that the interest rate changed to\n\n10% on September 1, 1991, they are silent as to what rate, if any, applied prior to\n\nSeptember 1, 1991.9 Cf. Act of May 23, 1991, 72nd Leg., R.S., ch. 467, §§ 1, 6,\n\n1991 Tex. Gen. Laws at 1695 (stating that the Act took effect on September 1,\n\n1991, and applied to child support due and owing after the statute’s effective\n\ndate); Castle, 960 S.W.2d at 143–44 (stating that before September 1, 1991,\n\nTexas common law favored the award of prejudgment interest for delinquent\n\nchild support payments).\n\n      Further, the portion of S.G.’s exhibits referencing the June 6, 1986 to\n\nAugust 27, 1993 time period merely states at the top of the first page, “Nominal\n\nAnnual Rate . . . :        10.000%,” even though, as set out above, the 1993\n\namendment to the statute “reache[d] back” and applied a 12% simple interest\n\nrate per year to arrears due and owing on September 1, 1991, in addition to\n\n\n\n      9\n       R.C. stopped making regular child support payments in 1986, the first\nyear that the order went into effect.\n\n                                        14\n\fchanging the rate from a monthly calculation.10 See W.G.S., 107 S.W.3d at 629;\n\nJenkins & Wilhite, O’Connor’s Texas Family Law Handbook at 1104. Nothing in\n\nS.G.’s exhibits reflects either change. Instead, the top of the second portion of\n\nS.G.’s exhibits, reflecting the date range September 3, 1993 to December 31,\n\n2001, states, “Nominal Annual Rate . . . :        12.000%,” ignoring the statutory\n\nrequirement of application from September 1, 1991.\n\n      Further, S.G.’s exhibits do not show the actual calculations used, making it\n\nimpossible for this court to determine how the numbers provided in the exhibits\n\nwere calculated, including the $40,000 difference between S.G.’s exhibits and\n\nR.C.’s exhibit.   See Chenault v. Banks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1989745\"><a href=\"/opinion/1989745/chenault-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.) (“Simply put, we cannot find any way, based\n\non the evidence presented, to support the trial court’s child support arrearages\n\ncalculation.”).   Although R.C. offered no evidence beyond the interest rates\n\nstated in his exhibit to controvert the interest rates recited in S.G.’s exhibits, R.C.\n\ndid not bear the burden of proof on this point. Consequently, because S.G.\n\nfailed to show the correct interest rate as applied, her exhibits were legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court’s award beyond $104,862.27, the\n\namount to which R.C. stipulated.         Because the trial court lacked sufficient\n\n\n\n\n      10\n         In contrast, R.C.’s copy of the Tarrant County record shows a 12%\ninterest rate from June 6, 1986 to December 31, 2001, but it also fails to show\nany interest calculations used in reaching the $104,862.27 figure.\n\n                                          15\n\fevidence upon which to exercise its discretion, we sustain part of R.C.’s second\n\npoint and render judgment for S.G. in the amount of $104,862.27.\n\nD. Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In his third point, R.C. argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding attorney’s fees that were incurred in securing S.G.’s default judgment,\n\nwhich was later set aside by the granting of his motion for new trial. Without\n\ncitation to authority, R.C. asserts that “[t]he granting of the Motion for New Trial\n\nshould have legally voided all the legal work performed in securing the default\n\njudgment.”11 See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i).\n\n\n      11\n        S.G. responds that the award of attorney’s fees was mandatory under\nsection 157.167(a). Family code section 157.167(a) provides, “If the court finds\nthat the respondent has failed to make child support payments, the court shall\norder the respondent to pay the movant’s reasonable attorney’s fees and all court\ncosts in addition to the arrearages.” Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 157.167(a) (West\n2014). When the trial court finds in a child-support enforcement action that the\nobligor has failed to make child support payments, it has no discretion but to\norder the obligor to pay the obligee’s reasonable attorney’s fees unless it also\nfinds that there is good cause for the failure to pay.

We\n\noverrule R.C.’s third point.\n\nE. Payout Schedule\n\n      In his final point, R.C. argues that the trial court should have used its equity\n\npowers to establish a payout schedule on the arrearage judgment because after\n\nit entered judgment, S.G. issued a wage assignment “[a]t the first opportunity” to\n\ngarnish more than his net monthly salary. However, in cases in which a trial\n\ncourt has created a payout schedule, the payout schedule’s presence cannot\n\nprevent execution on a judgment for arrearages—it merely gives the obligee an\n\nadditional permissible option for collecting what he or she is entitled to receive\n\nNotice of Application of Judicial Writ of Withholding,” he called S.G.’s attorney\nand voiced his objection, then hired an attorney in Corpus Christi who failed to\nfile an answer or contest the pending court action. R.C. then hired his instant\ncounsel to assist him. R.C. asserted in his motion for new trial, “The failure of the\nRespondent to file a contest before judgment was a mistake or accident caused\nby his failure to receive the proper information from the Petitioner’s attorney and\ncoordination problems between attorneys.” [Emphasis added.] S.G. filed a\nresponse to the motion, claiming that R.C. was properly served with the notice of\napplication for judicial writ of withholding, and she attached an affidavit by the law\nfirm employee who prepared the notice of application for judicial writ of\nwithholding and a green card to show receipt of the notice. S.G. stated in her\nresponse that she had had to hire a lawyer to represent her and prayed for her\n“reasonable attorney’s fees for this case.” At the November 2014 hearing, when\nR.C.’s attorney stated that the trial court had ruled that S.G.’s lawyer “did these\nthings without proper notice to them,” the trial court responded, “Well, the Court\nfound no such thing, but—the Court just set aside a default judgment. That’s all\nthe Court did. . . . [Y]ou’re attributing findings to this Court this Court never\nmade.”\n\n                                         18\n\funder the judgment.
