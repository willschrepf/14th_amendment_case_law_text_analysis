As a consequence of CFSA’s alleged discriminatory and retaliatory actions,\n\nplaintiffs claim that they are entitled to damages under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”), 29\n\nU.S.C. § 633a(a), the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”), and 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n1981 and 1983.\n\n       Pending before the Court are (1) the defendant’s motion, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, and (2) two\n\nmotions, pursuant to Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for leave to permit nine\n\nadditional current and former employees of CFSA to intervene as plaintiffs in this action. All\n\ntogether, the plaintiffs’ Complaint and proposed intervenors’ Complaints-in-intervention amount\n\nto over one hundred pages and over one thousand numbered paragraphs. They have alleged such\n\n                                             Page 1 of 94\n\fa plethora of facts that they have made clear their success on the merits is impossible. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, the Court finds that the claims of six plaintiffs are barred by res judicata\n\nor failure to meet the procedural prerequisites for bringing this action, and the claims of the three\n\nremaining plaintiffs fail to state cognizable causes of action. Consequently, the defendant’s\n\nmotion to dismiss is granted and the motions to intervene are denied.\n\nI.         FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n           A.       Procedural History\n\n           Two plaintiffs, Angella Peters 1 and Larry McCall, initiated this lawsuit on October 28,\n\n2009, alleging that the District of Columbia violated their rights under the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, for which they sought damages under 42\n\nU.S.C. §§1981 and 1983. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding\n\nfour plaintiffs — Maria Dyson, Augustine Ekwem, Jacqueline Moore and Katherine Washington\n\n— as well as claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the ADEA, and the\n\nDCHRA. On March 16, 2010, the Court granted the plaintiffs’ unopposed motion for leave to\n\nfile a Second Amended Complaint, 2 which added three more plaintiffs: Joan Simpson, Melva\n\nMeade, and Cynthia Courts-Marshall. 3 See Minute Order (Mar. 16, 2010) (Sullivan, J.). 4\n\n\n\n\n1\n There is discrepancy in the briefing material from the plaintiffs about the spelling of the lead plaintiff’s first name\n(she is sometimes referred to as “Angela” and other times referred to as “Angella”). The Court will refer to Ms.\nPeters as “Angella,” which is how her named is spelled in the Second Amended Complaint. See ECF No. 17.\n2\n For ease of reference, the Second Amended Complaint, ECF No. 17, which is at issue in the pending motion to\ndismiss, will be cited as “Compl.” herein.\n3\n  Although the defendant initially opposed the filing of the Second Amended Complaint as futile, the defendant\nwithdrew its opposition and instead “decided the most efficient way to address the procedural and substantive\ndeficiencies . . . would be to file a comprehensive Motion to Dismiss in response to this pleading. . . .” Def.’s Mem.\nin Opp’n to Mot. to Amend, ECF No. 15, ¶ 7.\n4\n    This case was re-assigned to the current presiding Judge on January 21, 2011.\n\n                                                      Page 2 of 94\n\f       The plaintiffs have continued to seek leave to add plaintiffs to this action. On July 23,\n\n2010, and again on April 22, 2011, the plaintiffs moved, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 24, to allow a total of nine additional putative plaintiffs to intervene. These motions\n\nto intervene are opposed by the defendant and have been denied by Order entered on March 30,\n\n2012. This Memorandum Opinion sets forth the reasons for that Order.\n\n       B.      Allegations in Second Amended Complaint\n\n       The nine plaintiffs named in the Second Amended Complaint are black women and men\n\nwho have worked as caseworkers and supervisors at the CFSA for varying lengths of time,\n\nranging from three to eighteen years. Four of the plaintiffs are current or former caseworkers\n\nand the other five plaintiffs are current or former supervisors. The four caseworker plaintiffs\n\n(Angella Peters, Larry McCall, Maria Dyson and Katherine Washington) complain primarily\n\nabout the allegedly abusive and discriminatory conduct directed at them by a single supervisor.\n\nThree of these caseworker plaintiffs apparently remain employed at CFSA: both Maria Dyson\n\nand Katherine Washington remain caseworkers in Child Protective Services (“CPS”), a\n\ncomponent of CFSA, and Larry McCall’s current assignment is not identified. The five\n\nmanagement plaintiffs (Cynthia Courts-Marshall, Jacqueline Moore, Joan Simpson, Augustine\n\nEkwem and Melva Meade), complain about the conduct of at least eight other managers at\n\nCFSA, including the CFSA Deputy Director of Operations, for allegedly creating a hostile work\n\nenvironment, and discriminatory and retaliatory conduct. Two of the management plaintiffs\n\n(Augustine Ekwem and Melva Meade) remain employed at CFSA, while the other three\n\nmanagement plaintiffs (Cynthia Courts-Marshall, Jacqueline Moore and Joan Simpson) are no\n\nlonger employed at CFSA.\n\n\n\n\n                                           Page 3 of 94\n\f           The Second Amended Complaint asserts two core allegations against CFSA: first,\n\n“[f]rom as early as 2001, the Child and Family Services Agency had a custom of allowing its\n\nsupervisors to bully older, black social workers, particularly those from Africa or the Caribbean\n\nIslands,” and this conduct created a hostile work environment that management condoned.\n\nCompl. at 2. Second, CFSA, from as early as 2003, “had a custom of allowing its supervisors to\n\nretaliate against social workers who complain about discriminatory practices.” Id. The alleged\n\nretaliatory actions against the plaintiffs took different forms, ranging from re-assignment of\n\nduties to demotion in position to the unfair assignment of an overwhelming caseload.\n\nSpecifically, the four caseworker plaintiffs complain that, following the tragic discovery, in\n\nJanuary 2008, of the deaths of Banita Jacks’ four young daughters in a Washington, D.C. row\n\nhouse, there was a “surge in [the number of] child abuse and neglect reports.” Id. ¶¶ 75-89\n\n(Peters), ¶¶ 125-33 (McCall), ¶¶ 166-93 (Dyson), ¶¶ 213-28 (Washington). While\n\nacknowledging this across-the-board increase in workload, the caseworker plaintiffs complain\n\nthat they were assigned an unfair number of cases, which resulted in backlogs and prompted\n\nadverse employment actions, ranging from being “written up” to reprimands. Id. Two\n\nsupervisor plaintiffs also allege retaliation: Jacqueline Moore alleges that after she complained to\n\nhuman resources about her treatment by a supervisor, she was retaliated against, id. ¶¶ 267-310,\n\nand Cynthia Courts-Marshall alleges that she was retaliated against after she refused to fire\n\nemployees as instructed by her supervisor, id. ¶¶ 605-10, 617-18. The allegedly retaliatory\n\nactions against these two supervisors included poor job performance evaluations, which resulted\n\nin a denial of pay increases, id. ¶¶ 272-81, 293 (Moore); demotion to a caseworker position to\n\nhelp with the post-Jacks tragedy surge in cases, id. ¶¶ 284-86 (Moore); and re-assignment or\n\nremoval of duties, id. ¶¶ 308-10 (Moore), id. ¶¶ 630-35 (Courts-Marshall). 5\n5\n    The three remaining supervisors (Simpson, Meade and Ekwem) do not assert retaliation claims.\n\n                                                    Page 4 of 94\n\f          All nine plaintiffs claim that they were discriminated against on the basis of race and\n\nsubjected or exposed to a hostile work environment during at least some portion of their\n\nemployment at CFSA between 2001 and 2009. 6 Four plaintiffs (Ekwem, Moore, Peters and\n\nSimpson) also claim discrimination on the basis of national origin. Six plaintiffs (Dyson,\n\nEkwem, McCall, Moore, Peters and Washington) claim age discrimination, even though the\n\nthree plaintiffs who do not make this claim are also over 40 years of age and two of them are\n\nolder than some of the plaintiffs who do claim age discrimination. Finally, six plaintiffs (Courts-\n\nMarshall, Dyson, McCall, Moore, Peters and Washington) claim retaliation. 7\n\n          The Title VII and ADEA discrimination claims asserted by each plaintiff are summarized\n\nin the chart below.\n\n\n    Plaintiff –       Discrimination based upon:                             Hostile Work         Retaliation\n    Position           Race      National                                    Environment\n                      (Black)    Origin       Age            Gender\n    Peters –          √       √ (Jamaican) √                NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                              (51)\n    McCall –          √         NO                 NO       NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                                     (57)\n    Washington-       √         NO                 √        NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                                     (52)\n    Dyson –           √         NO                 √        NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                                     (49)\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Based upon statements contained in the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend, the defendant construed the claims\nasserted in the Second Amended Complaint by the three new plaintiffs (Simpson, Meade and Courts-Marshall) to be\nlimited to claims ‘“under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution due to the\ndeprivation of equal protection rights; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.’ (Pl.’s Mot. Amend, p.2.).” Def.’s\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Mem”), ECF No. 21, at 9. The Court disagrees with the defendant’s\nview. The Second Amended Complaint asserts the same Title VII claims on behalf of all the plaintiffs.

Detailed\n\nreview of these claims, viewing the claims in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, is\n\nnecessary to assess their sufficiency and whether they “plausibly give rise to an entitlement to\n\nrelief,” as required by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1941, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868\n\n(2009).\n\n                 1.       Allegations of CFSA-CPS Caseworker Plaintiffs Supervised by the\n                          Same Supervisor\n\n          Four of the plaintiffs served as caseworkers in CFSA’s Child Protective Services and\n\ncomplain about the allegedly discriminatory and retaliatory conduct of the same supervisor.\n\n          Plaintiff Angella Peters is a 51-year old, black woman of Jamaican origin, who worked\n\nas a CPS caseworker for approximately 12 years until her resignation in October, 2009. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 24, 25, 93. On November 9, 2009, she filed a complaint against the CFSA with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), which issued a right-to-sue letter on March 2,\n\n2010. Id. ¶ 2. Peters claims racial, national origin and age discrimination, a hostile work\n\nenvironment and retaliation based upon allegations that (1) a white woman supervisor\n\n\n\n\n                                             Page 6 of 94\n\f(“Supervisor A”), 8 to whom Peters was assigned in 2005, “treated black caseworkers from\n\nAfrica and the Caribbean Islands in a demeaning fashion,” id. ¶ 40, apparently prompting three\n\nother employees from Jamaica and Nigeria to transfer out of the supervisor’s group, id. ¶¶ 40-46,\n\n48; (2) Supervisor A complained about, and punished Peters for, “alleged transgressions of other\n\ncaseworkers,” id. ¶¶ 50-51; “screamed at, talked down to, and pointed her finger at [Plaintiff]\n\nPeters,” as well as yelled at her in front of others, id. ¶¶ 52-53, and made “intimidating\n\ncomments” that the supervisor did not make to her “African American co-workers,” id. ¶¶ 54-\n\n55; (3) Supervisor A took other actions against Peters, such as blocking her from leaving her\n\ncubicle, stopping colleagues from talking to her, and following Peters “into the bathroom and\n\ninstruct[ing] her to get back to her typing as she used the bathroom stall,” id. ¶¶ 56-58; (4)\n\nSupervisor A “bullied” white caseworkers, id. ¶ 37; (5) Supervisor A retaliated after Peters and\n\nher co-workers complained to the Program Manager, Supervisor B, 9 about Supervisor A’s\n\n“abusive behavior” and race discrimination, prompting Supervisor B to hold a meeting in 2007\n\nwith Supervisor A and members of the unit, to discuss “racial sensitivity” and “assure[] the\n\ngroup that there would be no retaliation,” id. ¶¶ 68-72; and (5) following the Jacks tragedy,\n\nPeters was “assigned an overwhelming number of cases,” resulting in a case backlog for which\n\nshe was given warnings, a reprimand and proposed suspension in October, 2009, while other\n\nmembers of Supervisor A’s unit with similar backlogs were not written up, id. ¶¶ 75-87 (under\n\ncaption “Retaliation”).

LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       The defendant has moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule\n\n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim. In evaluating\n\nwhether a complaint sufficiently states a claim for relief to withstand a motion to dismiss under\n\n\n\n                                           Page 13 of 94\n\fthis Rule, the court must first ascertain whether the complaint contains “a short and plain\n\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” as well as grounds for the\n\ncourt’s jurisdiction and the specific relief sought. FED. R. CIV. P. (8)(a). While “detailed factual\n\nallegations” are not required, the complaint must “give the defendant fair notice of what the . . .\n\nclaim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555\n\n(2007) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661,\n\n668-71 (D.C. Cir. 2004). In assessing whether a complaint is sufficient, the “court ‘constru[es]\n\nthe complaint liberally in the plaintiff’s favor,’ ‘accept[ing] as true all of the factual allegations\n\ncontained in the complaint.’” Aktieselskabet AF 21. November 2001 v. Fame Jeans, 525 F.3d 8,\n\n15 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Kassem v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 513 F. 3d 251 (D.C. Cir. 2008)); see\n\nalso Atherton v. D.C. Office of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\n        Notably, “the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a\n\ncomplaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of\n\naction, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1940.\n\nThus, the complaint must set forth more than “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation\n\nof the elements of a cause of action,” and “more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\n\nharmed-me accusation.” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555); see also Aktieselskabet AF 21.\n\nNovember 21, 525 F.3d at 17 n.4 (explaining that the court has “never accepted legal conclusions\n\ncast in the form of factual allegations”) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n        “To survive a motion to dismiss, the pleadings must suggest a plausible scenario that\n\nshows that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Jones v. Horne, 634 F.3d 588, 595 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\n\n(internal citation and quotations omitted); see also Ivey v. Fenty, 789 F. Supp. 2d 65, 68 (D.D.C.\n\n2011) (“A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw\n\n\n\n                                             Page 14 of 94\n\fthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”) (internal\n\ncitations and quotations marks omitted). The plausibility standard for pleading demands more\n\nthan that the factual allegations present a “sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully,” and requires a “common sense,” “context-specific” examination of the pleadings to\n\n“determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at\n\n1949; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567-70 (antitrust complaint dismissed because allegations\n\nof parallel conduct, even accepted as true, were consistent with an unlawful agreement but also\n\ncompatible with, and indeed more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market\n\nbehavior and, therefore, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement). “Where a complaint\n\npleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line\n\nbetween possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, to “enter the realm of plausible liability,” the\n\nfactual allegations must be more than merely “neutral” or “suggestive,” and plaintiffs must\n\n“[nudge] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557\n\nn.5, 570.\n\n       Consequently, when evaluating whether a complaint sufficiently sets forth a plausible\n\nclaim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must apply a two-pronged approach, which, first,\n\n“identif[ies] pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\n\nassumption of truth.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950. Second, the court must examine the factual\n\nallegations and, assuming their veracity, “then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an\n\nentitlement to relief.” Id. Absent factual matter permitting the court “to infer ‘more than the\n\n\n\n\n                                             Page 15 of 94\n\fmere possibility of misconduct,’” the complaint must be dismissed. Jones, 634 F.3d at 596\n\n(quoting Atherton, 567 F.3d at 681-82). 18\n\n         Viewing the claims in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as it must at this stage of the\n\nproceedings, the Court proceeds with a discussion of the plaintiffs’ claims as follows. The Court\n\nfirst addresses, in section III, Plaintiff Ekwem’s claims, which the Court concludes are barred by\n\nthe doctrine of res judicata. The Court then turns, in section IV, to the defendant’s Motion to\n\nDismiss for the claims of the remaining eight plaintiffs. The Court addresses (A) the dismissal\n\nof the Title VII and ADEA claims of five of the plaintiffs for failure to exhaust their\n\nadministrative remedies. The Court then analyzes the claims of the remaining plaintiffs, Peters,\n\nMcCall, and Moore, addressing (B) their hostile work environment claims, (C) their disparate\n\ntreatment claims, and (D) their retaliation claims. The Court then reviews the plaintiffs’ (E)\n\nconstitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and (F) District of Columbia\n\nHuman Rights claims. Finally, the Court considers, in section V, the plaintiffs-intervenors’\n\nMotions to Intervene. Since the Court concludes that all of the plaintiffs’ claims are subject to\n\ndismissal, and denies the plaintiffs-intervenors’ motions to intervene, the case must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n18\n   In support of a more lenient standard governing motions under Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs cite Conley v. Gibson, 355\nU.S. 41, 45-46 (1957), see Pls.’ Mem. at 10, but the Supreme Court has “abrogated the Conley formulation in\n[Twombly, 555 U.S. 544, 562-63 (2007)].” Jones v. Horne, 634 F.3d at 596 n.4; see generally Arthur R. Miller,\nFrom Conley to Twombly to Iqbal: A Double Play on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 60 DUKE L. J. 1 (2010)\n(cited in Jones, 634 F.3d at 596 n.4). Even if the Court were not precluded by Supreme Court precedent in Iqbal\nand Twombly from adopting a more lenient standard, the plaintiffs’ claims would still be dismissed. This is not a\nsituation where the Court is dismissing a case because plaintiffs have not been sufficiently specific in their\nComplaint. In this case, the plaintiffs have pled their claims in such detail that it is possible for the Court to\ndetermine that the plaintiffs cannot possibly prevail on their claims. There is thus no reason to allow the plaintiffs to\nproceed beyond this stage of the proceedings, as no amount of elaboration of the plaintiffs’ claims would allow the\nplaintiffs to prevail on the merits of their claims. As the Supreme Court cautioned in Twombly, “when the\nallegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should\nbe exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.” 550 U.S. at 558\n(internal citation, quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).\n\n\n                                                    Page 16 of 94\n\fIII.   The Claims of Plaintiff Ekwem Are Barred by Res Judicata\n\n       The Court first turns to Plaintiff Ekwem’s claims. The defendant contends that the\n\nclaims asserted by Plaintiff Augustine Ekwem should be dismissed because he is barred from\n\nasserting them under the doctrine of res judicata. Indeed, Ekwem concedes that he was an\n\nindividual plaintiff in a separate lawsuit previously filed in this Court arising out of his\n\nemployment at CFSA. Pls.’ Mem. at 26. His prior lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice less\n\nthan two months before joining this suit, on December 10, 2009, as a plaintiff in the First\n\nAmended Complaint. See Ekwem v. Fenty, 666 F. Supp. 2d 71, 81 (D.D.C. 2009) (“The Court\n\ndismisses plaintiff’s federal claims because he has failed to state a claim for which relief can be\n\ngranted [and] declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismisses plaintiff’s state law\n\nclaims without prejudice.”). For the reasons discussed below, Ekwem’s claims are barred under\n\nthe doctrine of claim preclusion or res judicata. Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892 (2008).\n\n               A.      Legal Standard\n\n       “The doctrine of res judicata prevents repetitious litigation involving the same causes of\n\naction or the same issues.” Sheppard v. District of Columbia, 791 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D.D.C.\n\n2011) (citing I.A.M. Nat’l Pension Fund v. Indus. Gear Mfg. Co., 723 F.2d 944, 946 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1983)). Under claim preclusion, a subsequent lawsuit will be barred if there has been prior\n\nlitigation (1) involving the same claims or cause of action, (2) between the same parties or their\n\nprivies, and (3) there has been a final, valid judgment on the merits, (4) by a court of competent\n\njurisdiction. See Porter v. Shah, 606 F.3d 809, 813 (D.C. Cir. 2010); Smalls v. United States,\n\n471 F.3d 186, 192 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. Univ. of Ill. Found.,\n\n402 U.S. 313, 323-24 (1971); Comm’r of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597 (1948));\n\nHerrion v. Children’s Hosp. Nat’l Med. Ctr., 786 F. Supp. 2d 359, 368 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\n\n\n                                            Page 17 of 94\n\f       Moreover, a “‘final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their\n\nprivies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.’” Drake v.\n\nFAA, 291 F.3d 59, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980))\n\n(emphasis in original); see also Int’l Union v. Clark, No. 02-1484, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n64449, at *46 n.19 (D.D.C. Sept. 11, 2006) (“[I]ndividual who did properly exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies . . . is nevertheless barred from maintaining his Rehabilitation Act claim\n\nin this case because he litigated that claim to a judgment on the merits in [another] case . . . . The\n\ndoctrine of res judicata therefore applies to [that plaintiff]’s claim and requires dismissal of his\n\nclaim.”). There is no question here that the third and fourth prongs have been met since\n\nEkwem’s prior lawsuit was dismissed in a final judgment on the merits by another judge from\n\nthis Court. Thus, only the first and second factors for application of the res judicata doctrine\n\nneed be addressed.\n\n               B.      Analysis\n\n       In his dismissed complaint, Ekwem claimed, inter alia, that the defendants — the Mayor\n\nof the District of Columbia and CFSA — allegedly discriminated against him in violation of his\n\nright to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment, and conspired to deprive him of those\n\nrights in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988. Ekwem concedes that both of his\n\nlawsuits “allege employment discrimination at the [CFSA],” but argues that the first prong\n\nrequired for application of res judicata is not met. Pls.’ Mem. at 26. Specifically, he contends\n\nthat his current Complaint differs from the dismissed claims in two ways: first, the instant\n\nComplaint focuses on “a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, § 1981, ADEA, and\n\nDCHRA;” and, second, the instant Complaint asserts different facts regarding the “constructive\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 18 of 94\n\fterminations” of co-workers in November 2009 that were not in existence at the time of his prior\n\nlawsuit. Id.\n\n       The fact that the causes of action here are not identical to the causes of action in the prior\n\nsuit, however, does not overcome application of the res judicata doctrine to bar Ekwen’s claims.\n\n“Whether two cases implicate the same cause of action turns on whether they share the same\n\n‘nucleus of facts.’” Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 393 F.3d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Drake,\n\n291 F.3d at 66); Page v. United States, 729 F.2d 818, 820 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The factual\n\nallegations underpinning Ekwem’s current claims mirror those in the dismissed action. In the\n\ndismissed action, for example, Ekwem alleged that he was unfairly assigned an overwhelming\n\nnumber of cases to supervise in 2008 and that he was improperly disciplined after the death of a\n\nchild whose case had been assigned to a caseworker under Ekwen’s supervision. Ekwem, 666 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 74-75. He asserts the same allegations in the instant complaint, namely, that his\n\nworkload increased significantly in 2008 and that by June of 2008, he had been assigned more\n\ncaseworkers than any other supervisor. Compl. ¶¶ 446, 452. The instant Complaint also avers\n\nthat a caseworker under Ekwem’s supervision was assigned a child abuse and neglect case\n\n“which concluded on June 25, 2008 with the death of a six month old boy.” Id. ¶ 457.\n\nAccording to the Second Amended Complaint, the caseworker was terminated and, on July 9,\n\n2008, Ekwem was placed on administrative leave. Id. ¶¶ 462-63. Based on this conduct, he\n\nalleges that the CFSA discriminated against him on the basis of his “race (black), national origin\n\n(Nigerian), age (52), and gender (male).” Id. ¶ 426.\n\n       Under res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or\n\ntheir privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action. In this\n\naction, Ekwem reasserts claims of discrimination that have been previously decided on the\n\n\n\n                                            Page 19 of 94\n\fmerits, and a new claim of “hostile work environment” that arises from the same factual basis\n\nand thus could have been brought in his prior lawsuit. Despite the differences in legal theories,\n\nboth actions advanced by Ekwem relate largely to the same time period and turn on allegations\n\nthat Ekwem was unfairly assigned too many cases and too many caseworkers to supervise, which\n\nresulted in him being improperly suspended. The claims he asserts here could have been brought\n\nin that action and, having skipped that opportunity, he is not allowed to assert them here. 19\n\n         Finally, as to the last factor, the parties in the dismissed lawsuit are the same parties in\n\nthis litigation. In the prior action, Ekwem named Adrian Fenty, in his official capacity as Mayor\n\nof the District of Columbia, and the CFSA as defendants. See Ekwem, 666 F. Supp. 2d at 74.\n\nThe real party in interest for the Mayor and CFSA in the dismissed lawsuit was the District,\n\nwhich is the same defendant as in the instant action. See Sheppard, 791 F. Supp. 2d at 7 n.6\n\n(“Claims against the Mayor of the District of Columbia in his official capacity are construed as\n\nclaims against the District itself.”) (citing Atchinson v.

Supp. 2d 62, 65 (D.D.C. 2010) (substituting the\n\nDistrict of Columbia in place of mayor, police chief, and Department of Corrections);\n\nHenneghan v. D.C. Pub. Schs., 597 F.

Thus, his claims are barred by res judicata\n\n\n19\n  The claims asserted by the movant plaintiff-intervenor Patricia Ivey are likely also barred by res judicata since her\nprior discrimination lawsuit against the defendant arising from her employment as a CPS caseworker has also been\ndismissed. See Ivey v. Fenty, 789 F. Supp. 2d 65 (D.D.C. 2011) (plaintiff’s age discrimination suit for violation of\nDue Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\ndismissed for failure to state a claim). Since the parties have not briefed this issue, however, and her motion to\nintervene is resolved on different grounds, the Court need not address this issue.\n\n\n                                                   Page 20 of 94\n\fand are therefore dismissed.\n\nIV.      DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS OF THE\n         REMAINING EIGHT PLAINTIFFS\n\n         The defendant has moved, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, to dismiss the claims of the remaining eight plaintiffs on grounds that: first, the\n\nplaintiffs’ statutory claims under Title VII and the ADEA are barred for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies; and second, the allegations of discrimination underlying the plaintiffs’\n\nTitle VII, ADEA, 42 U.S.C. §§1981 and 1983, and DCHRA claims are insufficient either under\n\nthe McDonnell-Douglas framework or to demonstrate the requisite custom or policy of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia to establish municipal liability. These arguments are addressed seriatim\n\nbelow, assuming the truth of the plaintiffs’ allegations as the Court must do at the 12(b)(6) stage\n\nof proceedings.\n\n         A.       Dismissal of Title VII and ADEA Claims of Five Plaintiffs For Failure to\n                  Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n\n         The defendant argues for dismissal of the Title VII and ADEA claims in the Second\n\nAmended Complaint, except the claims asserted by Peters, as untimely due to the failure to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies. Def.’s Mem. at 11. At the time of filing the Second Amended\n\nComplaint only Peters had received a Right-to-Sue letter from the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”), even though both McCall and Moore had also filed EEOC\n\ncomplaints. Compl. ¶¶ 2-4. Both McCall and Moore subsequently received their right-to-sue\n\nletters on March 19 and August 26, 2010, respectively. Pls.’ Mem. at 11, 28; Pls.’ EEOC Docs,\n\nECF No. 30-2. 20\n\n\n20\n   In order to insure the completeness of the record regarding the status of the plaintiffs’ EEOC filings, the Court\ndirected the plaintiffs to submit “copies of any charge filed by a plaintiff or applicant for intervention with the\nEEOC that is related to the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint [and] . . . . any resulting right-to-sue letter\nissued by the EEOC.” Minute Order (Dec. 19, 2011). In response, the plaintiffs submitted the EEOC charges filed\n\n                                                   Page 21 of 94\n\f         The defendant does not address the impact of receipt by McCall and Moore of their\n\nEEOC right-to-sue letters after the filing of this lawsuit. Instead, the defendant analyzes the\n\nclaims of these two plaintiffs as part of the group of plaintiffs who filed no complaint with the\n\nEEOC (“non-filing plaintiffs”), and argues that the Title VII and ADEA claims of all eight of\n\nthese plaintiffs should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies before filing\n\nsuit. The plaintiffs contend that any non-filing plaintiff may rely on “vicarious exhaustion” to\n\nassert his or her discrimination claims here. The defendant counters that “the diverse and varied\n\nnature” of the plaintiffs’ claims precludes the availability of vicarious exhaustion to excuse the\n\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies. Def.’s Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss\n\n(“Def.’s Reply”), ECF No. 23, at 1. The Court agrees in part and disagrees in part. Specifically,\n\nas explained below, while the Court finds that McCall and Moore have timely exhausted their\n\nadministrative remedies, the non-filing plaintiffs may not “piggy-back” on the administrative\n\nexhaustion by three of the plaintiffs.\n\n\nby Plaintiffs Peters, Moore and McCall, as well as copies of the right-to-sue letters issued by the EEOC to each of\nthese plaintiffs. Pls.’ EEOC Docs, ECF No. 30. The plaintiffs indicated that three unidentified proposed intervenors\nhad filed EEOC complaints and one (Fedelia Phillips) had received a right-to-sue letter. Id. at 1. While a court may\nnot consider “matters outside the pleadings” in evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) without\nconverting the motion to one for summary judgment under Rule 56, see FED. R. CIV. P. 12(d), documents that are\nreferenced in, or an integral part of, the complaint are deemed not “outside the pleadings.” Mead v. Lindlaw, No.\n11-1063, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33225, at *7 (D.D.C. Mar. 13, 2012) (“In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court\nmay consider the facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the\ncomplaint, or documents upon which the plaintiff’s complaint necessarily relies even if the document is produced\nnot by [the parties].”) (internal quotations and citations omitted); Hinton v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 624 F. Supp. 2d 45,\n46 (D.D.C. 2009). In this case, the EEOC charges filed by Peters, McCall and Moore are referenced in the\nComplaint and therefore may be considered, along with the EEOC right-to-sue letters, without converting this\nmotion into one for summary judgment. See Ward v. D.C. Dep’t of Youth Rehab. Servs., 768 F. Supp. 2d 117, 120\nn.2 (D.D.C. 2011) (where “[t]he charge of discrimination is referred to in the complaint . . . , a reference that also\nnecessarily incorporates in the complaint the letter of determination resulting from the charge . . . the complaint\nnecessarily relies upon the fact of the charge and the letter in pleading that administrative proceedings were pursued\nbefore this action was begun [and] the motion need not be converted to one for summary judgment.”); Hamilton v.\nRhee, 770 F. Supp. 2d 241, 244 n.2 (D.D.C. 2011) (noting that EEOC charge “was incorporated by reference in the\nplaintiff’s complaint, and the court properly considers it as part of a motion to dismiss”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   Page 22 of 94\n\f               1.      Purpose of the Exhaustion Requirement\n\n       Generally, exhaustion of administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination\n\nwith the EEOC is required before a plaintiff may bring a civil suit under Title VII or the ADEA.\n\nSee, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 798 (1973); United Air Lines, Inc.\n\nv. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 555 n.4 (1977); Washington v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 160\n\nF.3d 750, 752 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (“Before . . . suing under either the ADEA or Title VII, an\n\naggrieved party must exhaust his administrative remedies . . . .”); McKeithan v. Boarman, 803 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 63, n.3 (D.D.C. 2011); see also 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(1); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). “The\n\npurpose of the [administrative exhaustion] doctrine is to afford the agency an opportunity to\n\nresolve the matter internally and to avoid unnecessarily burdening the courts.” Artis v.\n\nBernanke, 630 F.3d 1031, 1034 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Wilson v. Pena, 79 F.3d 154, 165\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996)). Ordinarily, as proof of such exhaustion of administrative remedies, a plaintiff\n\nwould receive a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, indicating either the EEOC’s dismissal of the\n\ncase or its inability to bring a civil action within 180 days of the plaintiff’s EEOC charge. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1); see also Park v. Howard Univ., 71 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\n\n(“Only after the EEOC has notified the aggrieved person of its decision to dismiss or its inability\n\nto bring a civil action within the requisite time period can that person bring a civil action\n\nherself.”); Currier v. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Inc., 159 F.3d 1363, 1366 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1998); Adams v. District of Columbia, 740 F. Supp. 2d 173, 186 (D.D.C. 2010). Thus, receipt of\n\na notice of right-to-sue letter is a condition precedent to the initiation of a Title VII or ADEA\n\naction in court. See Williams v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 721 F.2d 1412, 1418 n.12\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1983); Bondy v. Humana, Inc., No. 95-456, 1996 U.S. Dist.

Pa. 2002)\n\n(receipt of right-to-sue letter from the EEOC is a condition precedent to filing a Title VII claim).\n\n               2.      Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore’s Title VII and ADEA Claims\n                       Meet Exhaustion Requirement\n\n       At the outset, the defendant does not challenge Peters’ claims under Title VII or the\n\nADEA for failure to exhaust administrative remedies since she received her EEOC right-to-sue\n\nletters on March 2, 2010, after the filing of the original and First Amended Complaint, on\n\nOctober 28, 2009 and December 10, 2009, respectively, but before the filing of the Second\n\nAmended Complaint on March 16, 2010. Compl. ¶ 2; Pls.’ EEOC Docs, ECF No. 30-1. Moore\n\n“received her Right to Sue Letter on March 19, 2010,” after the filing of both the First Amended\n\nComplaint, when Moore first joined the action as a plaintiff, and the Second Amended\n\nComplaint. Pls.’ Mem. at 11, 28; Compl. ¶ 4; Pls.’ EEOC Docs., ECF No. 30-3. McCall\n\nreceived his right-to-sue letters from the EEOC for both his Title VII and ADEA claims on\n\nAugust 26, 2010, after the filing of all three complaints. Compl. ¶ 3. Pls.’ EEOC Docs., ECF\n\nNo. 30-2.\n\n       The law is clear that “the defect of a prematurely filed lawsuit may be excused when it is\n\ncured by the issuance of a right to sue letter while the action is pending.” Cruz-Packer v. District\n\nof Columbia, 539 F. Supp. 2d 181, 190 (D.D.C. 2008) (citing Williams, 721 F.2d at 1418 n.12).\n\nThus, defendant’s exhaustion argument is moot as to Moore and McCall. See Fennell v. AARP,\n\n770 F. Supp. 2d 118, 126 (D.D.C. 2011) (motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies denied where plaintiff received EEOC right-to-sue letter during pendency of lawsuit);\n\nGiardino v. District of Columbia, 252 F.R.D. 18, 20 (D.D.C. 2008) (“Because the EEOC . . .\n\nissued a right-to-sue letter prior to the dismissal of his federal employment claims, those claims\n\nwill not now be dismissed.”); Holmes v. PHI Serv. Co., 437 F. Supp. 2d 110, 123 (D.D.C. 2006)\n\n\n                                           Page 24 of 94\n\f(“[T]he plaintiff’s failure to exhaust her administrative remedies before bringing this action was\n\ncured when the EEOC issued its second right-to-sue letter to the plaintiff . . . encompassing her\n\nretaliatory discharge claim.”); see also Hunter v. D.C. Child & Family Servs. Agency, 710 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 152, 157 (D.D.C. 2010) (where plaintiff failed to allege receipt of right-to-sue letter but\n\nDistrict did not contest that plaintiff received the EEOC letter after the filing of the complaint,\n\nDistrict’s “exhaustion argument is deemed abandoned”). Accordingly, to the extent that the\n\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is intended to reach\n\nMoore and McCall, the motion is unavailing on this ground.\n\n                  3.       No Vicarious Exhaustion for Five Non-Filing Plaintiffs\n\n         The remaining five plaintiffs (Dyson, Washington, Meade, Simpson, and Courts-\n\nMarshall) have concededly not previously filed any complaints with the EEOC, despite the\n\nrequirement that all employment discrimination claims be initially and timely filed with the\n\nEEOC prior to pursuing relief in court. These five plaintiffs rely upon the “single-filing”\n\nexception to the normal rule to urge the Court to allow them to “piggy-back” on Peters’ perfected\n\ncharge and, presumably, the now perfected charges of McCall and Moore. 21 The single-filing\n\nexception “allows non-filing parties to join the suit of another similarly situated plaintiff who did\n\nfile an administrative complaint against the same defendant.” Brooks v. Dist. Hosp. Partners,\n\nL.P., 606 F.3d 800, 804 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing Foster v. Gueory, 655 F.2d 1319, 1322 (D.C.\n\n21\n   The Court is cognizant that because failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense, a plaintiff\ndoes not need to plead exhaustion in a complaint. Kim v. United States, 632 F.3d 713, 719 (D.C. Cir. 2011); Colbert\nv. Potter, 471 F.3d 158, 165 (D.C. Cir. 2006). This means that the defendant bears the burden of pleading and\nproving untimely exhaustion. Rosier v. Holder, No. 10-525, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67527, at *6-7 (D.D.C. June\n24, 2011) (citing Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d 433, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). When, however, in response to a\nmotion to dismiss, plaintiffs, such as the ones at bar, concede that they did not exhaust their administrative remedies\nand proffer a legal theory to excuse that failure, the court may assess the viability of that theory on a 12(b)(6)\nmotion. See Uzlyan v. Solis, 706 F. Supp. 2d 44, 53 (D.D.C. 2010) (analyzing under Rule 12(b)(6) plaintiff’s\nclaimed “basis upon which the exhaustion requirements should be waived”); see also Thompson v. DEA, 492 F.3d\n428, 438 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“Further, even when failure to exhaust is treated as an affirmative defense, it may be\ninvoked in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion if the complaint somehow reveals the exhaustion defense on its face.”).\n\n\n                                                    Page 25 of 94\n\fCir. 1981)); see also Byrd v. District of Columbia, 807 F. Supp. 2d. 37, 59 (D.D.C. 2011)\n\n(“Under specific circumstances, a court may alternatively apply the ‘single filing exception’ to\n\nallow a plaintiff who failed to adhere to administrative requirements to vicariously exhaust her\n\nfiling responsibilities via another plaintiff’s timely filed EEOC claim.”) (quoting Brooks, 606\n\nF.2d at 807). This exception is only available to non-filing parties, however, if they possess\n\nclaims that are “so similar to those asserted by the original plaintiff that no purpose would be\n\nserved by requiring them to file independent charges.” Id. at 63 (internal citations and quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see also Price v. Choctaw Glove & Safety Co., 459 F.3d 595, 599 (5th Cir.\n\n2006) (claims dismissed of plaintiff members of decertified class who had not filed\n\nadministrative charges since “[a] non-charging party cannot bring her own independent lawsuit\n\nbased upon another party’s charge.”); Horton v. Jackson County Bd. of County Commr’s, 343\n\nF.3d 897, 900-01 (7th Cir. 2003) (single filing rule not applicable to plaintiff, who was allegedly\n\nretaliated against for supporting the discrimination suit of co-plaintiff who filed administrative\n\ncharge, since despite the connection between them, different acts were behind the firing of the\n\ntwo plaintiffs).\n\n        In Cook v. Boorstin, 763 F.2d 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1985), which is relied upon by plaintiffs,\n\nsee Pls.’ Mem. at 10, the court explained that “the critical factor in determining whether an\n\nindividual Title VII plaintiff must file an [administrative] charge, or whether he may escape this\n\nrequirement by joining with another plaintiff who has filed such a charge, is the similarity of the\n\ntwo plaintiffs’ complaints.” Cook, 763 F.2d at 1466 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\n\nassessing the similarity of claims, the court provided a practical test, explaining that “[w]here the\n\ntwo claims are so similar that it can fairly be said that no conciliatory purpose would be served\n\nby filing separate [administrative] charges, then it would be wasteful, if not vain . . . to require\n\n\n\n                                             Page 26 of 94\n\fseparate . . . filings.” Id. (quoting Foster, 655 F. 2d at 1332) (internal quotations omitted). The\n\ncourt cautioned, however, that “where the two complaints differ to the extent that there is a real\n\npossibility that one of the claims might be administratively settled while the other can be\n\nresolved only by the courts . . . each plaintiff should be required to separately file . . . [a] charge\n\nin order to effectuate the purpose of Title VII’s provisions for administrative relief.” Id. (internal\n\nemphasis omitted); see also De Medina v. Reinhardt, 686 F.2d 997, 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1982)\n\n(reversing district court’s dismissal of intervenor’s claim upon finding that “her claim was so\n\nsimilar to that made by [plaintiff], who had filed an EEOC charge . . . that it can fairly be said\n\nthat no conciliatory purpose would be served by filing separate EEOC charges”); Byrd, 807 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 63 (“The similarity of two claims is evaluated for whether the original filing\n\nperforms the principal notice function of the EEOC filing requirement, thus rendering a second\n\nfiling by a similarly situated plaintiff unnecessary and wasteful.”); Moore v. Chertoff, 437 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 156, 163 (D.D.C. 2006) (“A plaintiff may invoke the doctrine of vicarious exhaustion\n\nonly if one plaintiff actually has exhausted his or her claims and if the exhausted claims are so\n\nsimilar to the unexhausted claims . . .”); Int’l Union v. Clark, No. 02-1484, 2006 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 64449, at *37 (D.D.C. Sept. 11, 2006) (failure of some plaintiffs to exhaust their\n\nadministrative remedies may be excused “so long [as] one of their co-plaintiffs has properly\n\nexhausted a claim that is ‘so similar that it can fairly be said that no conciliatory purpose would\n\nbe served by filing separate [administrative complaints]’” ).\n\n        As noted above, the exhaustion requirement serves the dual purpose of notice to the\n\nemployer of the charge and an opportunity for both the employer and the EEOC to settle the\n\ndispute. For this reason, in cases where the single-filing doctrine has been invoked, courts have\n\nexamined the original EEOC filing of the party with the perfected EEOC charge to evaluate\n\n\n\n                                             Page 27 of 94\n\fwhether it provided sufficient notice of all charges by the plaintiffs who claim to be similarly\n\nsituated and seek to “piggy-back” on that charge. Recent cases from this jurisdiction are\n\ninstructive in evaluating the similarity of claims for employment discrimination and retaliation to\n\nsupport application of the single-filing exception. For example, in Brooks v. Dist. Hosp.\n\nPartners, L.P., the D.C. Circuit found that the district court had improperly dismissed claims\n\nasserted by external applicants for nursing assistant positions for lack of administrative\n\nexhaustion. 606 F.3d at 807. The court concluded those external applicants could “piggy back”\n\non the perfected EEOC charge filed by an internal applicant since examination of that EEOC\n\ncharge showed that it raised the same race discrimination claim as the external applicants, was\n\nasserted on behalf of others similarly situated, and the EEOC’s investigation reviewed data\n\nrelated to both internal and external applicants to find a disparate impact on black candidates\n\nfrom the employer’s use of a new three-part screening test. Id. Thus, the court held that an\n\nindependent EEOC filing by the external applicants “would have been redundant: [the employer]\n\nalready had received adequate notice of appellants’ exact allegation and the EEOC had first\n\ncrack at resolving that allegation.” Id. In such circumstances, where multiple plaintiffs’ claims\n\narose from the same allegedly discriminatory practice presented to and analyzed by the EEOC,\n\nthe court found that the plaintiffs had “properly invoked the single-filing exception to join the\n\nlawsuit . . . .” Id. 22\n\n\n22\n  Courts in other jurisdictions have apparently limited application of the single-filing exception to circumstances\nwhere the party with the perfected administrative charge had noted the collective or class-wide nature of the claim in\nthe EEOC charge of discrimination. See Welch v. Eli Lilly & Co., No. 06-0641, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70389, at\n*10-12 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 11, 2009); see also Price v. Choctaw Glove & Safety Co., Inc., 459 F.3d 595, 599 (5th Cir.\n2006) (finding that a party invoking the single filing rule must establish that: the plaintiff is similarly situated to the\nperson who filed the EEOC charge; the charge provided some notice of the collective or class-action nature of the\ncharge; and the individual who filed the EEOC charge filed a suit that the piggybacking plaintiff may join);\nAnderson v. Montgomery Ward & Co., 852 F.2d 1008, 1016-17 (7th Cir. 1988) (finding that employees subject to\nsame discriminatory practice were not required to file timely charges with the EEOC so long as similarly situated\nemployees filed allegations of class-wide discrimination); Greene v. City of Boston, 204 F. Supp. 2d 239, 241 (D.\nMass. 2002) (finding that “similarly situated plaintiffs, who have failed to file administrative charges, or who have\n\n                                                     Page 28 of 94\n\f        The district court in Byrd v. District of Columbia reached a different result. In that Title\n\nVII lawsuit, four plaintiff-employees alleged sexual harassment and retaliation by two male\n\nsupervisors at the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation. Byrd, 807 F. Supp. 2d at 45. Chief\n\nJudge Lamberth reviewed the original EEOC charge and a supporting internal report submitted\n\nto the EEOC to determine whether a plaintiff, who never filed an EEOC complaint before joining\n\nthe lawsuit, was permitted to “piggy-back” on her co-plaintiffs’ perfected administrative\n\ncomplaints. Id. at 63. Despite certain similarities of legal claims and “overlapping” facts\n\nbetween the EEOC charge and the factual allegations asserted by the plaintiff, Chief Judge\n\nLamberth concluded that the plaintiff’s complaint would require “a different factual inquiry and\n\ntestimony from different witnesses,” and therefore would not put the defendant on notice of the\n\nextent of the plaintiff’s allegations or potential hostile work environment and retaliation claims.\n\nId. at 64. As a consequence, the court dismissed that plaintiff’s Title VII claims for failure to\n\ncomply with the administrative requirements. Id.\n\n        The Court finds that the legal and factual issues at stake in the instant matter are more\n\nakin to those in Byrd, where the court determined vicarious exhaustion was unavailable, than in\n\nBrooks. The Second Amended Complaint summarily mentions that Peters, McCall and Moore\n\nfiled charges with the EEOC, without any description of the precise factual allegations presented\n\nto that agency. No party to the instant action provided the Court with a copy or details regarding\n\nthe contents of these perfected EEOC charges in order to assess the sufficiency of notice about\n\nthe discrimination allegations, until the Court so directed. In its briefing, the defendant relies\n\nsolely on a comparison of factual allegations and legal claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint to show that they are so “diverse and varied” and “wide-ranging”\n\nfiled untimely charges, are permitted to piggyback on a timely-filed charge that gives the EEOC and the employer\nfair notice of allegations of class-wide discrimination.”).\n\n\n                                                  Page 29 of 94\n\fthat “separate administrative adjudication was not only possible, but necessary.” Def.’s Reply at\n\n3. In the defendant’s view, the five non-filing plaintiffs (Dyson, Washington, Simpson, Meade\n\nand Courts-Marshall) 23 may not piggyback on the administratively exhausted claims because\n\nthese plaintiffs allege different bases for discrimination and different kinds of mistreatment by\n\ndifferent supervisors. Def.’s Mem. at 11-12; Def.’s Reply at 3-4. The Court agrees.\n\n         The legal claims of the five non-filing plaintiffs are not identical to those asserted by\n\nMcCall, Moore, and Peters in the Second Amended Complaint or in their perfected EEOC\n\ncharges. In the Second Amended Complaint, the three filing plaintiffs each assert claims of race\n\ndiscrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation, and both Moore and Peters also assert\n\nclaims of age and non-American born national origin discrimination, all of which were stated in\n\ntheir respective EEOC charges. While each of the non-filing plaintiffs assert legal claims of race\n\ndiscrimination and hostile work environment within CPS during all or part of the same time\n\nperiod from 2005 to 2009, only one (Simpson) claims national origin discrimination, two\n\n(Washington and Dyson) claim age discrimination and four (claim retaliation). Thus, the non-\n\nfiling plaintiffs provide different combinations of protected status for their discrimination claims\n\nthan those included in the perfected EEOC charges of Peters, McCall, and Moore.\n\n         The differences in their legal claims undercut each other. Peters and Moore’s EEOC\n\ncharges assert age and national origin discrimination based upon the alleged assignment of more\n\nwork and the alleged harsher scrutiny given to older, non-American born black caseworkers and\n\nsupervisors. More precisely, Peters states in her EEOC charge that black caseworkers and\n\nsupervisors, who are “age 40 and over, and non-American born are systematically assigned more\n\nwork and subjected to harsher scrutiny than others who are not in these categories.” Pls.’ EEOC\n\n\n23\n  The claims of Plaintiff Ekwem are barred by the doctrine of res judicata, see supra, and therefore are not\ndiscussed in this section of the opinion.\n\n                                                   Page 30 of 94\n\fDocs., No. 30-1, at 1. Moore indicates in her EEOC charge that she has “been subjected to\n\ndifferential treatment as compared to my non-Trinidadian co-workers,” including that after a\n\nleave, she “discover[ed] that a younger, Black American had been hired to fill [her] position.”\n\nPls. EEOC Docs., ECF No. 30-3, at 1. Yet, despite their EEOC charges of age discrimination,\n\nwhich are repeated in the Second Amended Complaint, three of the non-filing plaintiffs (Meade,\n\nSimpson, and Courts-Marshall) are 40 or older but do not allege any age discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, despite the EEOC charges by Peters and Moore of national origin discrimination\n\nagainst non-American born black employees, McCall and four of the non-filing plaintiffs\n\n(Dyson, Washington, Meade, Courts-Marshall) do not fit into the category of “non-American\n\nborn” and still claim that they, too, were discriminated against because they were black. 24\n\n        The differences in the factual allegations pertaining to each plaintiff’s claims also\n\nundercut each other. For example, notably, Moore was one of four supervisors detailed to CPS\n\nto assist with the surge in cases after the Jacks tragedy, and despite her “humiliat[ion] by her\n\ndemotion to hotline caseworker,” she “received compliments on her work and a very good job\n\nperformance evaluation,” after which she was “officially reinstated to the position of supervisor\n\nand given a staff.” Compl. ¶¶ 285-92. Moore’s positive experience is difficult to square with the\n\nallegations of race, age and national origin discrimination directed at CPS caseworkers alleged\n\nby her co-plaintiffs. The Second Amended Complaint further undermines this core racial and\n\nnational origin discrimination claim with inconsistent allegations that employees who were not\n\nblack also suffered discriminatory actions. See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 176-88 (Dyson) (Indian co-worker\n\nalso assigned more cases than “white,” “younger” co-workers); id. ¶ 37 (Peters) (Supervisor A\n\n\n\n24\n  While Moore’s EEOC charge identifies the younger employee who assumed Moore’s position as “Black\nAmerican,” the Second Amended Complaint identifies that employee as “newly hired,” “younger” and “native\nborn,” omitting the fact that the employee was also black. Compl. ¶ 308.\n\n                                               Page 31 of 94\n\f“bullied” white caseworkers). As the defendant observes, “the individual plaintiffs’ allegations\n\nare so varied that they even contradict themselves.” Def.’s Reply Mem. at 3.\n\n       Although the non-filing plaintiffs’ legal claims overlap with those of the perfected EEOC\n\ncharges, this is not enough to excuse the bypassing of the administrative process for these five\n\nplaintiffs when the underlying factual allegations for each of their claims differ significantly.\n\nThe single-filing doctrine is limited to cases in which the legal claims are identical and arise\n\nfrom the same facts, not merely from overlapping or similar facts that may be linked to each\n\nother because the facts involve employees of the same agency. Indeed, just because the plaintiffs\n\nclaim to have suffered a violation of one or more of the same provisions of law as contained in\n\nthe perfected EEOC charges does not mean that their claims depend upon a shared set of facts or\n\na common injury that would have provided notice of the individual claims. Unlike Brooks,\n\nwhere not only the legal claims were identical but also the factual allegations supporting those\n\nclaims stemmed from the employer’s use of the same challenged hiring practice, Peters, McCall\n\nand Moore’s perfected administrative charges each allege distinct factual events that not only\n\ndiffer among themselves but also from those of the five non-filing plaintiffs.\n\n       Among the myriad ways in which the allegations asserted by the non-filing plaintiffs in\n\nthe Second Amended Complaint differ from the facts set forth in the EEOC charges filed by\n\nMcCall, Moore and Peters are that different management personnel were responsible for the\n\ndiscriminatory conduct at issue. The EEOC charges of both Peters and McCall cite allegedly\n\nunfair conduct only by Supervisor A and Moore cites such conduct only by Supervisor F. In the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint, Moore also describes allegedly abusive conduct by Supervisors D\n\nand G. The non-filing plaintiffs complain about entirely different supervisors. Non-filing\n\nplaintiffs Dyson, Simpson, Meade and Courts-Marshall complain about conduct by Supervisors\n\n\n\n                                            Page 32 of 94\n\fB, E, H and I, who are nowhere complained about by Peters, McCall or Moore either in the\n\nComplaint or in the perfected EEOC charges.\n\n       In addition, the alleged misconduct engaged in by Supervisors A through I towards the\n\nnon-filing plaintiffs varies significantly from the specific conduct alleged in the perfected EEOC\n\ncharges. McCall’s EEOC charge refers to a single instance of Supervisor A giving him a critical\n\nwritten performance warning in July, 2009, while Peters’ EEOC charge states that the same\n\nSupervisor A “singled [her] out” and “on at least four occasions” made formal write-ups about\n\nPeters’ performance, even though similarly situated employees, who were younger and white,\n\nwere not written-up. Pls.’ EEOC Docs., at ECF Nos. 30-1, 30-2. In the Second Amended\n\nComplaint, Peters provides additional detail that Supervisor A made abusive and demeaning\n\ncomments and engaged in bullying conduct directed at her. The other three CPS caseworkers\n\n(McCall, Dyson and Washington) allegedly witnessed aspects of Supervisor A’s mistreatment of\n\nPeters, but nowhere allege that this abusive conduct was directed at them. Indeed, even though\n\nDyson was supervised by Supervisor A, she claims that a different supervisor, Supervisor E,\n\nimposed performance penalties on her due to her backlog of cases following the Jacks tragedy.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 190-92.\n\n       As noted above, in her EEOC charge, Moore cites her black Supervisor F for excluding\n\nMoore from meetings and assigning her “a greater work load and . . . menial task[s].” Pls.’\n\nEEOC Docs., ECF No. 30-3.\n\n       By contrast to the conduct of Supervisors A and F cited in the perfected EEOC charges,\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory conduct engaged in by the other supervisors set forth in the Second\n\nAmended Complaint covers a broad range of activity. For example, certain supervisors are\n\naccused of ineffectually addressing employee complaints about Supervisor A’s conduct\n\n\n\n                                           Page 33 of 94\n\f(Supervisors B, C, D), refusing to write a recommendation (Supervisor B), or directing a\n\nsubordinate to terminate employees purportedly for retaliatory reasons (Supervisor I). These\n\ndifferences are significant. Confronted with the charges of the three filing plaintiffs, the EEOC\n\nwould not have been alerted to the scope of the allegations asserted now by the non-filing\n\nplaintiffs against a far greater number of supervisors in the Second Amended Complaint.\n\n       Finally, the claimed adverse employment consequences of the defendant’s allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory conduct varies between the filing and the non-filing plaintiffs. For example, both\n\nPeters and Moore claim that their resignations were constructive discharges, and McCall claims\n\nthat his job transfer was a constructive transfer. See Peters EEOC Charge, ECF No. 30-1 (“I\n\nresigned because the conditions were unbearable.”); Moore EEOC Charge, ECF No. 30-3 (“I am\n\non leave pending my retirement. . . .”); McCall EEOC Charge, ECF No. 30-2 (“I transferred out\n\nof the Ms. Jessen’s unit” and, according to the Compl. ¶ 138, out of the CPS). By contrast, the\n\nnon-filing plaintiffs claim injuries ranging from poor performance write-ups and transfers within\n\nCPS to termination. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 194 (Dyson transferred to another unit within CPS); ¶\n\n233 (Washington written-up); ¶ 394 (Simpson terminated); ¶ 561 (Meade feared retaliation but\n\nalleges no adverse employment action); ¶ 641 (Courts-Marshall terminated).\n\n       In sum, the allegations of the non-filing plaintiffs are not “so similar” that “no\n\nconciliatory purpose would be served by filing separate EEOC charges. . . .” Foster, 655 F.2d at\n\n1322. Consequently, the administrative complaints filed by McCall, Moore and Peters would not\n\nsuffice to provide notice to the EEOC or the possibility of the disposition of claims by the non-\n\nfiling plaintiffs, who seek to “piggy-back” on their co-plaintiffs’ perfected EEOC charges.\n\nTherefore, the doctrine of “vicarious exhaustion” does not apply and each plaintiff is required to\n\nexhaust his or her individual administrative remedies. Only Peters, Moore and McCall satisfy\n\n\n\n                                           Page 34 of 94\n\fthe exhaustion requirement. Accordingly, the Title VII claims of the non-filing plaintiffs Dyson,\n\nWashington, Meade, Simpson, and Courts-Marshall, as well as the ADEA claims 25 of plaintiffs\n\nDyson and Washington, will be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n           B.       Hostile Work Environment Claims of Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore\n\n                Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore contend that they have “actionable hostile work\n\nenvironment claims based on race, age and/or national origin discrimination.” Pls.’ Mem. at 11.\n\nViewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the Second Amended\n\nComplaint alleges, generally, that CFSA “[m]anagement condoned a hostile work environment\n\nand took no measures to prevent it.” Compl. at 2. In particular, both Peters and McCall allege in\n\nsupport of their claims, that they “worked in a racially hostile work environment, from 2005 to\n\n2009, where [older], black caseworkers, particularly those from Africa and the Caribbean\n\nIslands, were bullied by their supervisors.” Id. ¶¶ 22, 97. Moore alleges that she, too, “worked\n\nin a hostile work environment, from 2001 to the present, where she was bullied by her\n\nsupervisors.” Id. ¶ 237. The defendant contends that these plaintiffs have failed to establish a\n\nprima facie claim of a hostile work environment since, even if they were mistreated by their\n\nsupervisors, they cannot show it was because of their protected status. 26 Def.’s Mem. at 15-16.\n\nThe Court agrees that these plaintiffs have failed to plead a prima facie case of hostile work\n\nenvironment.\n\n25\n     Plaintiffs Meade, Simpson and Courts-Marshall did not assert age discrimination claims under the ADEA.\n26\n  The defendant summarily asserts without analysis that “many of the allegations” underlying the plaintiffs’ Title\nVII claims are time-barred, stating that Title VII claims require the filing of “a charge of discrimination with the\n[EEOC] either 180 days or 300 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-\n5(e)(1).” Def.’s Mem. at 22-23. For purposes of a hostile work environment claim, however, the law permits\nconsideration of activity falling outside the limitation period so long as the acts underlying the claim occur within\nthe period. See Baird v. Gotbaum, 662 F.3d 1246, 1251 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“Provided that an act contributing to the\nclaim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court\nfor the purposes of determining liability.”) (quoting Singletary v. District of Columbia, 351 F.3d 519, 526-27 (D.C.\nCir. 2003) and Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 117 (2002)).\n\n\n                                                   Page 35 of 94\n\f          1.           Legal Standard\n\n        A plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VII by proving that the employer created or\n\ncondoned a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson,\n\n477 U.S. 57, 64-65 (1986). Discrimination in this form occurs “[w]hen the workplace is\n\npermeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.” Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted); Singletary, 351 F.3d at 526. The Supreme Court in Harris explained that assessing\n\nwhether a hostile work environment exists has both subjective and objective components. Thus,\n\nno Title VII violation is present “if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to\n\nbe abusive” and the conduct “is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or\n\nabusive work environment.” Harris, 510 U.S. at 21-22.\n\n        While the subjective test of whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive\n\nmay be readily satisfied in employment discrimination suits, the Supreme Court has\n\nacknowledged that the boundaries of what constitutes an objectively discriminatorily hostile\n\nwork environment is not “a mathematically precise test.” Id. at 22. The “objective severity of\n\nharassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s\n\nposition, considering all the circumstances.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75,\n\n81 (1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted). This objective test requires examination of\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, including “the frequency of the discriminatory [or retaliatory]\n\nconduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.”\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 23.\n\n\n\n                                           Page 36 of 94\n\f        The Supreme Court has been clear that Title VII does not establish a “general civility\n\ncode for the American workplace.” Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80. Indeed, “Title VII does not prohibit\n\nall verbal or physical harassment in the workplace.” Id. “[S]imple teasing, offhand comments,\n\nand isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to” a hostile work environment.\n\nFaragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted); see also EEOC v. Sunbelt Rentals, Inc., 521 F.3d 306, 315-16 (4th Cir. 2008)\n\n(complaints that would objectively give rise to bruised or wounded feelings or incidents that are\n\npremised on nothing more than rude treatment, callous behavior, or a routine difference of\n\nopinion and personality conflict will not satisfy the severe or pervasive standard).\n\n        To “[prevent] Title VII from expanding into a general civility code,” the Supreme Court\n\nhas emphasized as “crucial” the requirement that the behavior be “so objectively offensive as to\n\nalter the conditions of the victim’s employment.” Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81; see also Faragher,\n\n524 U.S. at 788 (“Conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of\n\nemployment . . . .”). Bosses may be harsh, unfair and rude, but conduct so characterized does\n\nnot necessarily rise to the level of a Title VII violation.\n\n        In addition, the plaintiff “must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely\n\ntinged with offensive . . . connotations, but actually constituted discrimination . . . because of”\n\nthe employee’s protected status. Oncale, 523 U.S. at 81 (quotation marks and emphasis\n\nomitted). In other words, plaintiffs are required to establish a causal connection between the\n\nharassment and their protected activity to succeed on the claim. See Nichols v. Truscott, 424 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 124, 140-41 (D.D.C. 2006). “It is therefore important in hostile work environment\n\ncases to exclude from consideration personnel decisions that lack a linkage of correlation to the\n\nclaimed ground of discrimination. Otherwise, the federal courts will become a court of\n\n\n\n                                             Page 37 of 94\n\fpersonnel appeals.” Lewis v. District of Columbia, No. 07-0429, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93299,\n\nat *38-39 (D.D.C. Sept. 8, 2010) (citing Bryant v. Brownlee, 265 F. Supp. 2d 52, 63 (D.D.C.\n\n2003)).\n\n          Taken together, the Supreme Court’s guidance about the requisite elements for a hostile\n\nwork environment claim has been enumerated as follows: the plaintiff must show that (1) he or\n\nshe is a member of a protected class; (2) he or she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3)\n\nthe harassment occurred because of the plaintiff’s protected status; (4) the harassment was severe\n\nto a degree which affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) the employer\n\nknew or should have known about the harassment, but nonetheless failed to take steps to prevent\n\nit. Turner v. Shinseki, No. 07-0643, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131426, at *59-60 (D.D.C. Nov. 15,\n\n2011); Dorns v. Geithner, 692 F. Supp. 2d 119, 135-36 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Hendricks v.\n\nPaulson, 520 F. Supp. 2d 65, 89 (D.D.C. 2007)); Roberson v Snow, 404 F. Supp. 2d 79, 89-90\n\n(D.D.C. 2005).\n\n          Set against these requirements, and assuming the “veracity” of the plaintiffs’ claims,\n\nplaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore have “failed to alleged facts that ‘plausibly give rise to an\n\nentitlement to relief’” for their hostile work environment claims. Ivey, 789 F. Supp. 2d at 72\n\n(quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949-50).\n\n            2. Analysis\n\n            In this case, there is no dispute that plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore, who each are\n\nblack and over 40 years of age, are members of a protected class and that they each allege that\n\nthey personally felt the CFSA-CPS environment was hostile. Indeed, as to Peters and McCall at\n\nleast, the defendant concedes that, “[i]f taken as true, these allegations may establish that\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 38 of 94\n\f[Supervisor A] was rude and intimidating . . . .” Def.’s Mem. at 14. Thus, the Court finds that\n\nthe first two elements of a hostile work environment claim are met.\n\n        Nevertheless, the defendant contends that the plaintiffs fail to show that any alleged\n\nmistreatment was because of their membership in a protected class. Id. at 14-18. In determining\n\nwhether a hostile work environment exists, the court must look at the “totality of the\n\ncircumstances,” including whether the comments or actions at issue “expressly focused” on the\n\nplaintiff’s protected class. McKeithan, 803 F. Supp. 2d at 69 (quoting Baloch v. Kempthorne,\n\n550 F.3d 1191, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 2008)). According to the defendant, “no plaintiff in this action\n\nalleges facts showing that he or she was the direct target of a single discriminatory remark or\n\naction, much less a working environment heavily polluted with discrimination.” Def.’s. Reply at\n\n5 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the plaintiffs acknowledge that “the\n\nharassment, with a few exceptions, was primarily harsh treatment as opposed to racial or ethnic\n\ncomments.” Pls.’ Mem. at 16. Moreover, the defendant argues that merely witnessing abusive\n\nconduct, when the conduct at issue does not contain “any sort of racial, ethnic or age-related\n\novertones,” Def.’s Reply at 4, is not enough to establish a valid claim for hostile work\n\nenvironment. The hostile work environment claims of plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore are\n\naddressed individually below.\n\n               a.      Plaintiff Peters\n\n       Peters provides the most detail about patently unpleasant conduct by Supervisor A that\n\nwas directed at Peters and that she claims contributed to the hostile work environment at CFSA-\n\nCPS. Supervisor A allegedly over a period of about four years, “harassed” Peters, treated her\n\n“like a ‘whipping boy,’” “screamed at, talked down to, and pointed her finger [and] . . . yelled at\n\nMs. Peters,” “made intimidating comments” about getting her fired or threatening to “write [her]\n\n\n\n                                           Page 39 of 94\n\fup,” physically blocked Peters on several occasions from leaving her cubicle with the placement\n\nof a chair and instructed her to get back to work when Peters was in the bathroom, and\n\ninterrupted Peters’ conversations to stop others from talking to her. Compl. ¶¶ 36-73. Indeed,\n\nPeters is identified as the employee who was “the principal target of [Supervisor A’s] abuse.”\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 48, 223; see also id. ¶ 108 (“Ms. Peters received the worst treatment.”); id. ¶ 158\n\n(“Ms. Peters received the most degrading treatment of anyone.”); id. ¶ 354 (“[Supervisor A]\n\nsingled Ms. Peters out for harsh treatment.”). The defendant argues that these actions directed at\n\nPeters do not contain discriminatory content and therefore “fail to show that [Supervisor A]\n\nmistreated Ms. Peters because of her protected status.” Def.’s Mem. at 15 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). Indeed, even rude office conduct that generates stressful working conditions does not\n\ncreate liability for discrimination under Title VII, unless that conduct is “permeated with\n\ndiscriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.” Harris, 510 U.S. at 21 (internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n       In an effort to satisfy the requirement of showing an environment hostile to persons due\n\nto their race, national origin or age — as opposed to generally unpleasant for all the employees\n\nand particularly unpleasant for Peters — the plaintiffs allege that “older, black caseworkers,\n\nparticularly those from Africa and the Caribbean Islands, were bullied by their supervisors\n\n[while] [s]imilarly situated caseworkers, who were younger or not black, were not bullied by\n\ntheir supervisors.” Compl. ¶¶ 22-23, 97-98, 145-46. Yet, this assertion is undermined by the\n\nallegations that (1) white caseworkers managed by Supervisor A “were bullied like their black\n\ncounterparts,” id. ¶ 37; (2) Supervisor A “complain[ed] about other caseworkers,” id. ¶ 50,\n\napparently without distinction as to their protected status; (3) Supervisor A “did not make\n\n[intimidating ] comments to . . . Ms. Peters’ African American co-workers,” id. ¶ 55; and (4)\n\n\n\n                                           Page 40 of 94\n\fSupervisor A’s unit, which the complaint alleges includes both white and black caseworkers,\n\ncomplained about this supervisor’s “abusive behavior” and accused her of race discrimination,\n\nid. ¶¶ 37, 68-69; 119. As the defendant states, “plaintiffs’ allegations clearly indicate that\n\n[Supervisor A] mistreated everyone, regardless of their race.” Def.’s Mem. at 15.\n\n       Not only do the internally inconsistent factual allegations in the Complaint defeat the\n\nthird requisite element of showing that Peters was subjected to abuse because of her protected\n\nstatus, but she has failed to establish the fourth requisite element for a hostile work environment\n\nclaim. Specifically, during the several years that Peters worked for Supervisor A from 2005 until\n\nearly 2008, there is no allegation that she was penalized by any material adverse change in the\n\nterms or conditions of her employment. Over the course of those four years, she does not allege\n\nthat she was given any “write-up,” any reprimand, any suspension, or any forced transfer. In\n\nfact, the only adverse personnel actions cited by Peters — warnings and a reprimand allegedly\n\nculminating in her alleged constructive discharge in October, 2009 — occurred after the 2008\n\nJacks tragedy and are part of the factual allegations underlying Peters’ claim of retaliation. See\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 74-89 (captioned “Retaliation”); see also Hampton v. Vilsack, 760 F. Supp. 2d 38, 56-\n\n57 (D.D.C. 2011) (“Plaintiff cannot, however, rely on the discrete acts upon which he bases his\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims to support a hostile environment claim.”) (citing Franklin v.\n\nPotter, 600 F. Supp. 2d 38, 76 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Because plaintiff’s allegedly hostile events are\n\nthe very employment actions he claims are retaliatory, he cannot so easily bootstrap alleged\n\nretaliatory incidents into a broader hostile work environment claim.”) (internal quotation marks\n\nand citations omitted)); Wade v.

Supp. 2d 11, 33 (D.D.C. 2003) (“Discrete acts\n\nconstituting discrimination or retaliation claims . . . are different in kind from a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim that must be based on severe and pervasive discriminatory intimidation or\n\ninsult.”)).\n\n        Even if Peters’ allegations of adverse personnel actions in 2008 and 2009 are considered\n\nin support of her claim of a hostile work environment as well as her retaliation claim, they must\n\nbe considered in the context of other allegations in the Complaint. Peters’ claims about her\n\ntreatment following the Jacks tragedy generally boil down to the allegation that she was assigned\n\nan overwhelming number of cases, which created a backlog for which she was penalized by\n\nbeing “written up” multiple times, when “other members of [Supervisor A’s] unit” with similar\n\nbacklogs “were not written up.” Compl. ¶ 85. She alleges more specifically that “by March 31,\n\n2008” she “had 41 cases to investigate with a backlog of 31 cases,” and was being written up for\n\nthe backlog the following month. Id. ¶¶ 79, 83. She had more of a backlog than McCall and\n\nDyson but less of a backlog than Washington, but they too were written up. Id. ¶¶ 127, 131 (as\n\nof March 31, 2008, McCall had 36 cases to investigate with a backlog of 28 cases); id. ¶ 168 (as\n\nof March 31, 2008, Dyson had 38 cases to investigate with a backlog of 28 cases); id. ¶ 215 (as\n\nof March 31, 2008, Washington had 42 cases to investigate with a backlog of 33 cases); see also\n\n¶¶ 438, 445 (caseworker supervised by Ekwem had, in March, 2008, “40 cases assigned her,”\n\nwhich increased thereafter to “57 cases”). Thus, from the face of the Complaint at least, it seems\n\nthat, contrary to Peters’ claim, other caseworkers in her unit with similar backlogs were, in fact,\n\nalso written up, including American-born caseworkers (McCall, Dyson and Washington) and\n\ncaseworkers older than Peters who do not claim age discrimination (McCall).\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 42 of 94\n\f       Moreover, other allegations make clear that the increased assignment of cases was not\n\njust to black caseworkers. An Indian caseworker was also assigned a large number of cases, id.\n\n¶¶ 176-85, and of fourteen caseworkers with 40 or more cases, eleven were older than 40 years\n\nof age and five of those older workers were foreign born caseworkers from Africa, the Caribbean\n\nIslands and India. Id. ¶¶ 183-84. This suggests that the majority of caseworkers assigned a large\n\ncaseload were not foreign-born and that the increase in reports of child abuse and neglect\n\nincreased the workload across the board. In addition, it suggests that older caseworkers, no\n\nmatter their race or ethnicity, were assigned and expected to deal with an increased load,\n\npresumably because they were more experienced.\n\n       Another judge on this Court has reached a similar conclusion in dismissing equal\n\nprotection claims of hostile work environment and intentional discrimination of Patricia Ivey, a\n\nproposed plaintiff-intervenor in this action. See Ivey, 789 F. Supp. 2d at 65 (Jackson, J.). In that\n\ncase, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant “created a hostile work environment for older\n\ncaseworkers . . . by assigning them an overwhelming number of cases and then threatening them\n\nwith disciplinary action if they did not eliminate their backlog,” while “younger caseworkers\n\nwere not assigned as many cases . . . .” Id. at 70. Judge Jackson found the allegations\n\ninsufficient to meet the plausibility threshold in Iqbal in view of the common sense questions\n\nabout how much smaller the caseloads of younger workers were compared to those of the older\n\nemployees and “what was the level of experience of the younger workers?” Id. at 70. She also\n\nscrutinized the plausibility of the plaintiff’s allegation that the assignment of a large caseload\n\nwas motivated by some discriminatory animus and concluded that “there are multiple other\n\ninferences that can be drawn from these allegations.” Id. at 71. Judge Jackson observed, “[f]or\n\nexample, at a time when the Agency was under intense public scrutiny, one reasonable\n\n\n\n                                            Page 43 of 94\n\finterpretation of the allegations is that more cases were assigned to older caseworkers because of\n\ntheir superior experience and knowledge of child protective services.” Id.\n\n       The instant allegations make apparent that the CFSA-CPS work environment was\n\nstressful and that this stress increased in 2008 after the Jacks tragedy, with supervisors pressing\n\nto ensure satisfactory job performance by caseworkers. Indeed, in the wake of the deaths of the\n\nfour Jacks children, increased scrutiny within the agency on job performance would be a\n\ncommon sense response to such a tragic wake-up call. Even a highly stressful work environment\n\nis not the same as a hostile work environment imbued with the requisite pervasive discriminatory\n\nanimus to support a Title VII claim. While Peters complains that she was penalized for her job\n\nperformance, this simply does not constitute an adverse employment action because of her\n\nprotected status, when she concedes in the Complaint that she “could not eliminate her backlog\n\nno matter how many hours she worked,” Compl. ¶ 84, and other allegations make apparent that\n\nothers were similarly over-loaded with cases and penalized for their backlogs. See Reshard v.\n\nLaHood, No. 87-2794, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34426, at *17 (D.D.C. Apr. 7, 2010) (letter of\n\nreprimand for employee’s failure to perform assigned duties not materially adverse, even though\n\nit would be placed in employee’s personnel file for up to three years).\n\n       For these reasons, Peters has failed to satisfy the requirements for a prima facie case of\n\nhostile work environment by showing that she was subjected to hostility because of her protected\n\nstatus or that pervasive hostility adversely affected the conditions of her employment amounting\n\nto an adverse employment action. Accordingly, she has failed to state a claim of hostile work\n\nenvironment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 44 of 94\n\f               b.       Plaintiff McCall\n\n       Plaintiff McCall corroborates the treatment by Supervisor A of Peters, alleging that “Ms.\n\nPeters received the worst treatment.” Compl. ¶ 108; see also id. ¶ 158 (“Peters received the most\n\ndegrading treatment of anyone.”) (Dyson); id. ¶ 223 (“Peters was the principal target of\n\n[Supervisor A’s] abuse.”) (Washington); id. ¶ 354 (“[Supervisor A] singled Ms. Peters out for\n\nharsh treatment.”) (Simpson). Yet, these allegations that Supervisor A targeted Peters more than\n\nother similarly situated caseworkers actually undermines the plaintiffs’ assertion that Supervisor\n\nA’s conduct towards them was uniformly animated by their protected status rather than some\n\npersonal animosity towards Peters. When focusing on Supervisor A’s conduct towards him,\n\nMcCall alleges only that this supervisor “constantly tried to intimidate him with comments like,\n\n‘I am going to write you up.’” Id. ¶ 115. This allegation of threatened personnel action falls\n\nshort of alleging that the threat was because of his protected status and, in any event, simply does\n\nnot amount to such extreme discriminatory intimidation or ridicule to alter the conditions of his\n\nemployment. Franklin, 600 F. Supp. 2d at 77 (the fact that supervisor “threatened” plaintiff with\n\njob-related consequences for his refusals to meet workplace expectations does not demonstrate a\n\nhostile work environment pervaded by discrimination or retaliation); Singh v. U.S. House of\n\nReps., Comm. on Ways & Means, 300 F. Supp. 2d 48, 56 (D.D.C. 2004) (“Criticisms of a\n\nsubordinate’s work and expressions of disapproval (even loud expressions of disapproval) are the\n\nkinds of normal strains that can occur in any office setting. . . .”); see also Baloch, 550 F.3d at\n\n1201 (finding that “totality of circumstances” did not show hostile work environment despite\n\nplaintiff’s “several verbal clashes with his supervisor in the workplace”). Thus, McCall fails to\n\nestablish the third and fourth requisite elements for a prima facie case of hostile work\n\nenvironment.\n\n\n\n                                            Page 45 of 94\n\f               c.     Plaintiff Moore\n\n       Plaintiff Moore alleges in support of her claim of hostile work environment that for eight\n\nyears, from 2000 to 2008, Supervisor F, who is black, singled her out for abusive treatment,\n\nincluding making “disparaging remarks,” such as “I did not pick you” and “You would not have\n\nbeen my choice;” excluding her from meetings and staff lunches; screaming at her; and\n\nthreatening to write her up for “borderline insubordination.” Compl. ¶¶ 247-63. Moore does not\n\nindicate how frequently such remarks were made. While the Court certainly does not condone\n\nthe expression of disparaging or unfair remarks by a supervisor to an employee, Moore’s\n\ncontinued performance of her supervisory duties over an eight year period, with positive\n\nevaluations for her performance during her detail and from caseworkers whom she supervised,\n\nsee, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 196, 232, tends to undercut her contention that this was a hostile work\n\nenvironment. See Sewell v. Chao, 532 F. Supp. 2d 126, 142 (D.D.C. 2008) (“[s]tray remarks\n\nmade occasionally over an approximately eight-year period” including raised voices by\n\nsupervisor, do not make workplace hostile), aff’d per curiam, Sewell v. Hugler, No. 08-5079,\n\n2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 4136, at *2-4 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 25, 2009).\n\n        Moore seeks to satisfy the third element for a prima facie case of hostile work\n\nenvironment that she was mistreated because of her race, age or national origin with the bare\n\nallegations that she was “the only black foreign born supervisor” and the “oldest supervisor”\n\nunder Supervisor F. Compl. ¶¶ 247, 249. She alleges that she was “excluded from many\n\nmeetings,” yet also complains about Supervisor F’s conduct towards her when she “did attend\n\nmeetings.” Id. ¶¶ 255-56. After one incident, apparently in 2001, when Supervisor F “began\n\nscreaming at her,” Moore complained to human resources and received an apology from the\n\nsupervisor. Id. ¶¶ 257-59. These are clearly upsetting work incidents but such travails without\n\n\n\n                                           Page 46 of 94\n\fany other indication that they were due to her protected status, is not enough to show a hostile\n\nwork environment. Moore also complains about her detail as a “hotline caseworker” following\n\nthe Jacks tragedy. She alleges, however, that she was not the only supervisor “detailed” to assist\n\nwith the surge of child abuse and neglect reports occurring after the Jacks tragedy, although she\n\nclaims to be the only supervisor placed in a “hotline caseworker” position. Id. ¶ 285. While\n\ndetailed as a hotline caseworker, she “received compliments on her work and a very good job\n\nperformance evaluation,” and following the detail, she was reinstated to a supervisory position\n\nwith a staff. Id. ¶¶ 285, 291, 292. Positive feed-back and evaluations, as well as restoration to a\n\nfull management position, are inconsistent with a claim that she was discriminated against in a\n\nhostile work environment. Thus, without more, her bare allegations about her protected status\n\nare insufficient to show that the treatment Moore received from Supervisor F was because of her\n\nage, national origin or race.\n\n       In addition, in the portion of the Complaint relating to her “Hostile Work Environment”\n\nclaim, Moore does not claim that the harassment was severe to a degree which affected a term,\n\ncondition, or privilege of employment to satisfy the fourth element for this claim. Indeed, co-\n\nplaintiffs give positive reviews of Moore’s work performance. Compl. ¶ 196 (“Dyson\n\nconsidered Ms. Moore to be one of the best supervisors at the agency.”); ¶ 232 (“Washington\n\nenjoyed working under Ms. Moore.”). Moreover, while Moore claims that she “feared that her\n\njob was in jeopardy,” id. ¶ 265, such concern, without more, simply does not constitute an\n\nadverse employment action. See Herbert v. Architect of the Capitol, 766 F. Supp. 2d 59, 76\n\n(D.D.C. 2011) (proposed reprimand that “‘put [plaintiff] in fear’ that it would ‘jeopardize his\n\npromotion’” is not a materially adverse action) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                           Page 47 of 94\n\f       The Complaint does not make clear whether the factual allegations underlying Moore’s\n\n“Retaliation” claim are also proffered in support of the hostile work environment claim, a\n\nconfusion that applies equally to the claims for discrete discriminatory acts, as discussed below.\n\nUnder the caption of “Retaliation,” Moore alleges a series of actions by three different\n\nsupervisors stretching over the period from 2005, after she complained to a counselor from the\n\nEmployee Assistance Program and to human resources, until her alleged constructive discharge\n\nin November, 2009. These retaliation allegations claim (1) “openly abusive” conduct towards\n\nher by Supervisor G, including poor job performance evaluations from Supervisors F and G in\n\n2005, 2006, and 2007, which resulted in making her ineligible for a pay increase; (2) “harsh\n\ntreatment” by Supervisor D in the spring of 2009 that consisted of “regularly shout[ing]” at\n\nMoore and “on at least two occasions threaten[ing] Ms. Moore with disciplinary action;” (3) her\n\n“detail” as a hotline caseworker in CPS to assist with the post-Jacks surge in child abuse and\n\nneglect reports; and (4) removal of her staff, office and position, after she took an unapproved\n\nfour-month leave under the Family Medical Leave Act. Compl. ¶¶ 267-311.\n\n       Even if these retaliation allegations — consisting of poor performance evaluations,\n\nthreatened disciplinary action, a temporary detail to a subordinate position and removal of her\n\njob responsibilities — are considered as part of her hostile work environment claim to show that\n\nthe abusive environment adversely affected her employment conditions, the Second Amended\n\nComplaint simply does not show that any of the actions outlined were because of her race, age or\n\nnational origin. In view of the positive job performance evaluations she received during her\n\ndetail, restoration of her supervisory position upon completion of the detail, and positive\n\ndescriptions by other plaintiffs about Moore’s performance in 2009, see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 196, 230-32,\n\nthe Second Amended Complaint simply does not indicate that the allegedly hostile work\n\n\n\n                                           Page 48 of 94\n\fconditions unreasonably interfered with her work performance. See Curry v. District of\n\nColumbia, 195 F.3d 654, 662 n.16 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 23); Hussain v.\n\nGutierrez, 593 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6-7 (D.D.C. 2008). Thus, even considering the retaliation\n\nallegations as part of Moore’s claim of hostile work environment does not cure the failure to\n\nmeet the fourth element for a prima facie case.\n\n       In sum, despite the lengthy factual allegations asserted in the Complaint in support of the\n\nplaintiffs’ claim of hostile work environment, they have failed to establish critical elements for\n\nsuch a claim that would “nudge” their allegations into the plausible realm. Without plausible\n\nallegations, the claims do not survive the Motion to Dismiss.\n\n       C.      Disparate Treatment Claims of Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore\n\n       As previously noted, the Title VII and ADEA discrimination and retaliation claims of\n\nonly Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore survive the defendant’s exhaustion challenge. The\n\nSecond Amended Complaint contains broad allegations of disparate treatment associated with a\n\nhostile work environment. See, e.g., Compl. at 2 (the defendant “discriminated against them and\n\nsimilarly situated employees on the basis of their race, national origin, age”); id. ¶ 23 (Peters)\n\n(“Similarly situated caseworkers, who were younger or not black, were not bullied by their\n\nsupervisors.”); id. ¶ 98 (McCall) (same); id. ¶ 250 (Moore) (“[Supervisor F] singled Ms. Moore\n\nout for abusive treatment.”). The Second Amended Complaint does not clearly distinguish the\n\nallegations underlying the hostile work environment claim from those showing disparate\n\ntreatment arising from discrete discriminatory acts due to the plaintiffs’ race, age and/or national\n\norigin. See Baird, 662 F.3d at 1253 (noting that plaintiff’s failure to segregate in the complaint\n\nthose events she claims constitute a hostile work environment from discrete acts of\n\ndiscrimination and/or retaliation “doubtless complicates the court’s task”). In any event, the\n\n\n\n                                            Page 49 of 94\n\fD.C. Circuit has made clear that the same acts may “simultaneously support different types of\n\nTitle VII claims” since “plaintiffs are free to plead alternative theories of harm that might stem\n\nfrom the same allegedly harmful conduct.” Id. at 1252. 27\n\n        To the extent that the plaintiffs are alleging discrete discriminatory acts, the defendant\n\ncontends that dismissal of the plaintiffs’ disparate treatment claims is warranted because the\n\nplaintiffs “have failed to allege facts that show an adverse employment action,” or that their\n\n“alleged mistreatment was because of [their] membership in a protected class.” Def.’s Mem. at\n\n18-19. As already noted, supra note 24, the defendant also asserts without analysis, that “[m]any\n\nof plaintiffs’ allegations fall well outside of” the applicable limitations period. Id. at 23. The\n\ndisparate treatment claims of Peters, McCall and Moore will now be evaluated seriatim below\n\nfor their sufficiency.\n\n         1.      Legal Standard\n\n        Both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the ADEA make it “unlawful for an employer”\n\nto “discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s age,” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1), or “because\n\nof such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).\n\nUnder both Title VII and the ADEA, “the two essential elements of a discrimination claim are\n\nthat (i) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action (ii) because of the plaintiff’s race,\n\ncolor, religion, sex, national origin [or] age. . .” Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1196; Brady v. Office of the\n\nSergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 493 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n        An “adverse employment action” is “a significant change in employment status, such as\n\nhiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a\n\n\n27\n  At the same time, however, a plaintiff may not combine discrete acts to form a hostile work environment claim,\n“without meeting the required hostile work environment standard.” Baird, 662 F.3d at 1252.\n\n                                                  Page 50 of 94\n\fdecision causing significant change in benefits.” Baird, 662 F.3d at 1248 (quoting Douglas v.\n\nPreston, 559 F.3d 549, 552 (D.C. Cir. 2009)); see also Stewart v. Ashcroft, 352 F.3d 422, 426\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003) (“Adverse employment action . . . [entails a] tangible employment action\n\nevidenced by firing, failing to promote, a considerable change in benefits, or reassignment with\n\nsignificantly different responsibilities.”). Thus, “not everything that makes an employee\n\nunhappy is an actionable adverse action.” Baird, 662 F.3d. at 1250 (internal citation omitted).\n\n       “[R]esignations or retirements are presumed to be voluntary . . . .” Veitch v. England,\n\n471 F.3d 124, 134 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (Rogers, J., concurring); see also Keyes v. District of\n\nColumbia, 372 F.3d 434, 439 (D.C. Cir. 2004); Henn v. Nat’l Geographic Soc’y, 819 F.2d 824,\n\n828 (7th Cir. 1987). The doctrine of constructive discharge may apply in certain circumstances\n\nto allow an employee to overcome the presumption of voluntariness and demonstrate that the\n\nresignation or retirement constituted an adverse employment action by showing that the\n\nresignation or retirement was, in fact, not voluntary. Aliotta v. Bair, 614 F.3d 556, 566-67 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2010) (citing Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., 433 F.3d 794, 805 (11th Cir. 2005)); Vega v. Kodak\n\nCaribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir. 1993). “The test for constructive discharge is an\n\nobjective one: whether a reasonable person in the employee’s position would have felt compelled\n\nto resign under the circumstances.” Aliotta, 614 F.3d at 566; see also Steele v. Schafer, 535 F.3d\n\n689, 695 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (for constructive discharge, a plaintiff must show that “the abusive\n\nworking environment became so intolerable that [the] resignation qualified as a fitting response”)\n\n(quoting Penn. State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 134 (2004)).\n\n       2.      Analysis\n\n       The Second Amended Complaint repeatedly alleges in general, conclusory terms that\n\nPlaintiffs Peters, Moore and McCall, along with other employees and the non-filing plaintiffs,\n\n\n\n                                           Page 51 of 94\n\fwere “harassed” or subjected to “abusive treatment.” See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 43-45, 47, 105-07,\n\n114, 154-55, 157 (referring to unnamed Nigerian and Jamaican or foreign-born caseworkers\n\nbeing abused). The specific discrete discriminatory actions allegedly directed at plaintiffs Peters,\n\nMoore and McCall must be teased out of these general assertions in order to assess the\n\nsufficiency of their claims of disparate treatment. Indeed, the defendant’s characterization of the\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations as “disjointed” and as an effort to “throw a host of allegations of\n\ndiscrimination against the wall in an apparent hope that something will stick,” is fairly accurate\n\nand not merely advocacy hyperbole. Def.’s Mem. at 12. The incidents of disparate treatment\n\nalleged by Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore are analyzed below.\n\n                 a.       Alleged Disparate Treatment Actions Against Plaintiffs Peters and\n                          McCall\n\n        The same factual allegations underlying the plaintiffs’ claims of hostile work\n\nenvironment are also apparently used to support the claims of discrete discriminatory actions.\n\nSee Baird, 662 F.3d at 1252 (“[P]laintiffs are free to plead alternative theories of harm that might\n\nstem from the same allegedly harmful conduct.”). Both Peters and McCall claim that Supervisor\n\nA discriminated against them by: (1) at unspecified times apparently between 2005 and 2007, 28\n\nthreatening to write them up, Compl. ¶ 54 (Peters), ¶ 115 (McCall); and (2) in 2008, following\n\nthe Jacks tragedy and surge in child abuse and neglect reports, writing them up for having\n\nbacklogs of cases when other caseworkers with similar backlogs were not written up, id. ¶¶ 83-\n\n85 (Peters), ¶¶ 131-32 (McCall). In addition, Peters claims that, at unspecified times apparently\n\nbetween 2005 and 2007, this supervisor (3) screamed and talked down to her, id. ¶ 52; and (4)\n\n\n\n\n28\n   While the Complaint does not provide the precise timing of the events cited, the Court discerns the time period\n“between 2005 and 2007” based on the chronological order in which the events are described over the years covered\nin the Second Amended Complaint.\n\n                                                 Page 52 of 94\n\ftook inappropriate actions, such as blocking her from leaving her desk and interrupting her\n\nconversations with co-workers or her restroom breaks. Id. ¶¶ 56-58.\n\n       At the outset, the Court must consider the obvious, namely, whether claims stretching\n\nback to 2005 are time-barred. The alleged adverse acts occurring in 2008 or earlier fall outside\n\nthe 300-day statute of limitations for filing an EEOC complaint and are time-barred. Title VII\n\nrequires “aggrieved persons” to file a charge with the EEOC within 180 days after the alleged\n\nunlawful employment practice occurred, but this period is extended to 300 days when the person\n\nhas initially instituted a procedure with a state or local agency. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). A\n\n“work-sharing” arrangement between the EEOC and the District of Columbia Office of Human\n\nRights (“DCOHR”) deems timely-filed EEOC charges as cross-filed with the DCOHR, making\n\nthe deadline for filing EEOC charges in the District of Columbia 300 days from the date of the\n\nalleged discrimination. Tucker v. Howard Univ. Hosp., 764 F. Supp. 2d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2011) (“In\n\nthe District of Columbia, an [EEOC] charge must be filed within 300 days of the date of the\n\nalleged discrimination.”); Ellis v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 631 F. Supp. 2d 71, 78 (D.D.C.\n\n2009) (“When a charge of discrimination is filed with the EEOC in the District of Columbia, a\n\nclaim is automatically cross-filed with the D.C. Office of Human Rights (“DCOHR”) pursuant to\n\na ‘worksharing agreement’ between the two agencies.”) (citing Carter v. George Washington\n\nUniv., 387 F.3d 872, 879 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). This requirement is one of “the prerequisites that a\n\nplaintiff must satisfy before filing suit.” AMTRAK v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109 (2002); see\n\nalso Singletary, 351 F.3d at 523; Currier, 159 F.3d at 1366 & n.2; Smith-Thompson v. District of\n\nColumbia, 657 F. Supp. 2d 123, 131 (D.D.C. 2009) (employee claiming discrimination under\n\nTitle VII must comply with this timing requirement “or lose the ability [to] recover for it.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                           Page 53 of 94\n\f          Peters filed her EEOC “Charge of Discrimination” on November 9, 2009, and McCall\n\nfiled his charge on November 2, 2009. Thus, only disparate treatment claims based on events\n\noccurring after January 13, 2009 for Peters and January 6, 2009 for McCall are timely.\n\nSingletary, 351 F.3d at 526 (“‘[D]iscrete discriminatory acts’ such as terminations and failures to\n\npromote . . . ‘are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in\n\ntimely filed charges.’”) (quoting Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113\n\n(2002)). The allegations describing conduct that occurred between 2005 and 2008 are time-\n\nbarred.\n\n          The only disparate treatment allegation made by Peters that appears to fall within the\n\nstatutory period is that “[Superviser A] wrote up [Peters] multiple times until the warnings lead\n\n[sic] to a reprimand and the reprimand to a proposed suspension in October 2009,” prompting\n\nher to resign that month. Compl. ¶¶ 87, 93-94. Peters alleges that her “backlog was similar to\n\nthose of other members of [Supervisor A’s] unit, who were not written up.” Id. ¶ 85. Just as this\n\nclaim was found insufficient to support the hostile work environment claim, it is insufficient to\n\nsupport a disparate treatment claim. As discussed, in subsection B.2.a, supra, penalizing Peters\n\nfor poor work performance when she concedes she “could not eliminate her backlog no matter\n\nhow many hours she worked,” Compl. ¶ 84, may have appeared to her to be unfair but that is a\n\nfar cry from discriminating against her for her protected status. In the context of the increased\n\nworkload and pressure under which CPS was operating in the aftermath of the Jacks tragedy, the\n\nincreased scrutiny and supervision given to employees is not surprising. Moreover, as discussed\n\nin connection with her claims of hostile work environment, contrary to Peters’ claim that her\n\nassigned workload and reprimands for her backlog in 2009 were discriminatory, the workload\n\n\n\n\n                                             Page 54 of 94\n\fincreases appear to have been shared by other caseworkers, who were similarly written up for\n\nbacklogs. These claims simply do not support a claim of disparate treatment.\n\n       McCall makes no disparate treatment allegation that falls within the statutory period.\n\nIndeed, while he complains about being unfairly “written up” for his backlog of cases after the\n\nJacks tragedy, the latest occasion he cites for such a write-up occurred “[i]n the summer of\n\n2008.” Id. ¶ 131. The only other incident he cites within the statutory period is that “[i]n the\n\nsummer of 2009, [he] suffered a groin injury that caused him to take a week off from work,” and\n\nupon his return Supervisor A told him that “she should have written him up for complaining\n\nabout her a year earlier.” Id. ¶ 137. This appears to be an allegation of retaliation rather than\n\ndisparate treatment, however, and no other information is provided to assist the Court in\n\nunderstanding the purpose for which that allegation is made. In short, McCall has not made out\n\na timely claim of disparate treatment.\n\n       b.      Alleged Disparate Treatment Actions Against Plaintiff Moore\n\n       Moore claims that her supervisors from 2000 to 2008 discriminated against her by: (1)\n\nscreaming at or making disparaging remarks about her, id. ¶¶ 263, 269; (2) regularly threatening\n\nto write her up and actually writing her up for “borderline insubordination,” id. ¶¶ 261, 301; (3)\n\nexcluding her from staff meetings and lunches, id. ¶¶ 255, 257, 260; (4) giving her poor job\n\nperformance evaluations in 2005, 2006 and 2007, id. ¶¶ 274-80; and (5) detailing her to serve as\n\na “hotline caseworker” following the Jacks tragedy, id. ¶ 285. To the extent that any of these\n\nallegations constitute disparate treatment, they are all time-barred. Moore filed her “Charge of\n\nDiscrimination” with the EEOC on December 8, 2009, see ECF No. 30-3 at 1, and therefore, any\n\nallegations concerning events that occurred before February 11, 2009 are untimely.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 55 of 94\n\f        The only allegations occurring between February 11, 2009 and her resignation in\n\nNovember 2009 asserted by Moore that may support a disparate treatment claim are that after\n\nSupervisor D became her supervisor in the spring of 2009, he “regularly shouted at [her] in the\n\npresence of her staff,” Compl. ¶ 300, and removed her job responsibilities upon her return from\n\nan unapproved four-month FMLA leave, id. ¶¶ 303-08. These allegations simply are not\n\nsufficient to state a claim of disparate treatment. Nowhere does Moore allege that Supervisor D\n\ntreated her harshly due to her protected status. Even harsh treatment by a supervisor does not\n\nsupport an employment discrimination claim, absent any assertion that the treatment was due to\n\nthe plaintiff’s race, age or national origin. Indeed, Moore indicates that her relationship with\n\nSupervisor D started off well, id. ¶ 299 (“[Supervisor D] was initially sympathetic . . .”), which is\n\nnot consistent with the behavior of a supervisor motivated by racial animus.\n\n        Moreover, it strains common sense to attribute the removal of Moore’s job\n\nresponsibilities to disparate treatment. Not only does she not make that allegation, she concedes\n\nthat she took a four-month leave from her job that was not approved by her supervisor.\n\n        In order to meet the requirement of showing an adverse employment action for a\n\ndisparate treatment claim under Title VII or the ADEA, both Peters and Moore claim that their\n\nresignations were constructive discharges. 29 Id. ¶¶ 93-4 (Peters); ¶ 311 (Moore); Pls.’ Mem. at\n\n22. McCall claims that he was forced to accept a transfer out of the CPS that reduced his take\n\nhome pay. Compl. ¶¶ 138-40. Even assuming as true that the resignations and transfer were\n\nadverse employment actions, these plaintiffs fail to show that they were subject to any discrete\n\n\n\n\n29\n   Moore alleges in the Second Amended Complaint that she resigned, Compl. ¶ 311, and in her EEOC “Charge of\nDiscrimination” that “[a]s of 11-23-09 I am on leave pending my retirement effective 12-31-09.” ECF No. 30-3.\nWhether Moore resigned or retired is immaterial since under either circumstance the Court will construe her\nallegation as one of constructive discharge.\n\n                                                Page 56 of 94\n\facts of discrimination because of their race, age or national origin and therefore that there was\n\nany causal connection to their resignations or transfer.\n\n       D.        Retaliation Claims of Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore\n\n       Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore each claim that they were retaliated against for\n\ncomplaining about the discriminatory conduct of their supervisors. The defendant contends that\n\n“the Complaint itself shows there was a legitimate reason for the purportedly retaliatory acts”\n\nand therefore the plaintiffs fail to make out a prima facie case of retaliation. Def.’s Mem. at 19.\n\nThe Court agrees that the retaliatory acts alleged are either time-barred or are insufficient as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n       1.        Legal Standard\n\n       Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer:\n\n            to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed\n            any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,\n            or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\n            any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this\n            subchapter.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).\n\n       To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that\n\n“(1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and\n\n(3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.” Hamilton v.\n\nGeithner, 666 F.3d 1344, 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Woodruff v. Peters, 482 F.3d 521, 529\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2007)); Wiley v. Glassman, 511 F.3d 151, 155 (D.C. Cir. 2007); Smith v. District of\n\nColumbia, 430 F.3d 450, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2005); Morgan v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg.Corp., 328\n\nF.3d 647, 651 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Singletary, 351 F.3d at 524; Mitchell v. Baldrige, 759 F.2d 80,\n\n86 (D.C. Cir. 1985).\n\n\n\n                                            Page 57 of 94\n\f       As to the first element, protected activity encompasses utilizing informal grievance\n\nprocedures such as complaining to management or human resources about the discriminatory\n\nconduct. Richardson v. Gutierrez, 477 F. Supp. 2d 22, 27 (D.D.C. 2007) (“It is well settled that\n\nTitle VII protects informal, as well as formal, complaints of discrimination.”); see also Bell v.\n\nGonzales, 398 F. Supp. 2d 78, 94 (D.D.C. 2005) (“Initiation of EEO counseling to explore\n\nwhether an employee has a basis for alleging discrimination constitutes protected activity, even\n\nin the absence of an unequivocal allegation of discrimination.”).\n\n       A plaintiff meets the second element to show a prima facie case of retaliation if “a\n\nreasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,” meaning that\n\nit “might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\n\ndiscrimination.” Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006)\n\n(“Burlington Northern”). Thus, adverse actions giving rise to retaliation claims are broader than\n\nfor disparate impact claims and are “not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms\n\nand conditions of employment,” but reach any harm that “well might have dissuaded a\n\nreasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Baird, 662 F.3d at\n\n1249 (quoting Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 68). Yet, the Court in Burlington Northern\n\ndistinguished “materially adverse” actions from “trivial harms,” “petty slights,” and “minor\n\nannoyances.” Id. at 68. The Court also noted that “[c]ontext matters” and “the significance of\n\nany given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.” Id. at 69; see\n\nalso id. (“[A]n act that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.”) (citation\n\nomitted). As discussed above, resigning, retiring or transferring from a position, as plaintiffs\n\nPeters, Moore and McCall did, respectively, may constitute an adverse employment action of\n\nconstructive discharge or involuntary transfer if the plaintiff shows that the resignation,\n\n\n\n                                            Page 58 of 94\n\fretirement or transfer occurred under conditions that forced that choice. Baird, 662 F.3d at 1248-\n\n49.\n\n         Finally, the third element of the test requiring a causal link between the protected activity\n\nand the adverse employment action may be satisfied merely by close temporal proximity\n\nbetween the two events. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) (noting\n\nthat the temporal connection must be “very close”: a three-or four-month period between an\n\nadverse action and protected activity is insufficient to show a causal connection, and a twenty-\n\nmonth period suggests “no causality at all”); Hamilton, 666 F.3d at 1357 (“[T]emporal proximity\n\ncan indeed support an inference of causation, but only where the two events are very close in\n\ntime.”) (quoting Woodruff, 482 F.3d at 529).\n\n         Significantly, however, even if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation,\n\ndismissal may still be warranted for failure to state a claim if the defendant shows a legitimate\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for its actions. See Broderick v. Donaldson, 437 F.3d 1226, 1231\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2006). Such a legitimate reason breaks the causal connection between the first two\n\nelements and defeats a retaliation claim. Then “the court must simply determine whether the\n\nplaintiff has put forward enough evidence to defeat the proffer and support a finding of\n\nretaliation.” Bright v. Copps, No. 08-755, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142160, at *23 (D.D.C. Dec.\n\n9, 2011) (citing Woodruff, 482 F.3d at 530); McGrath v. Clinton, 666 F.3d 1377, 1383 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2012).\n\n         2.     Analysis\n\n         Set against the applicable legal standard for showing a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nretaliation claims of Peters, McCall and Moore fall short. The retaliation claims of these three\n\nplaintiffs are discussed below.\n\n\n\n                                             Page 59 of 94\n\f                  a.       Retaliation Claims of Plaintiffs Peters and McCall\n\n         Both Peters and McCall allege that they engaged in protected activity on two occasions.\n\nFirst, in 2007, they complained to management personnel about the abusive conduct of\n\nSupervisor A, resulting in a meeting convened by Supervisor B at which they “accused\n\nSupervisor A of race discrimination.” Compl. ¶¶ 69-73, 119-21. Although they were assured\n\n“that there would be no retaliation,” Supervisor A “became very hostile.” Id. ¶¶ 73, 123.\n\nSecond, “in 2008 and 2009,” Peters and McCall lodged complaints with Supervisors C and D\n\nabout Supervisor A’s actions in writing them up and threatening penalties for their backlog of\n\ncases in the aftermath of the Jacks tragedy, even though other caseworkers in the unit with\n\nsimilar backlogs were not written up. Id. ¶¶ 79-89, ¶¶ 128-32. According to Peters and McCall,\n\ndespite their complaints to management about Supervisor A’s treatment, “neither [Supervisor C\n\nor D] took steps to end the abuse.” Id. ¶ 88; see also id. ¶ 133. Their requests for transfer were\n\ndenied. Id. ¶¶ 89, 134. When poor job evaluations led to a proposed suspension in October,\n\n2009, Peters resigned. Id. ¶ 93. When Supervisor D advised McCall that he was facing a write-\n\nup, McCall transferred out of CPS in August, 2009. 30 Id. ¶ 138.\n\n         At the outset, again, the Court must consider the timeliness of these allegations of\n\nretaliation that date back to 2007. The first allegation of retaliation in the form of increased\n\nhostility from Supervisor A towards Peters and McCall appears to be time-barred. The vague\n\ntiming set forth in the Second Amended Complaint indicates that the increased hostility of\n\nSupervisor A began in 2007 and, therefore, occurred long before the statutory 300-day period in\n\nJanuary 2009 before the filing of these plaintiffs’ EEOC charges. In any event, even if this\n\nallegation of retaliation were considered to be timely, the claim does not survive the Motion to\n\n30\n   In their opposition brief, the plaintiffs state that McCall transferred out of CPS “after being threatened by\n[Supervisor A] with a write up that he felt would lead to his termination,” Pls.’ Mem. at 23, but the Complaint\nattributes this final write-up threat to Supervisor D. Compl. ¶138.\n\n                                                   Page 60 of 94\n\fDismiss. Other than increased hostility from Supervisor A, neither Peters nor McCall assert that\n\nthey were subjected to an adverse employment action in connection with their 2007 complaint to\n\nmanagement about Supervisor A’s mistreatment of them. Thus, this allegation simply cannot\n\nplausibly support a retaliation claim.\n\n       With regard to the second incidence of retaliation, the Second Amended Complaint is not\n\nentirely clear when “[i]n 2008 and 2009” Peters made informal complaints to program managers\n\nSupervisors C and D “about [Supervisor A] . . . to end the abuse.” Compl. ¶ 88. No dates\n\nwhatsoever are provided for when McCall “complained to several managers, including\n\n[Supervisors C and D], about [Supervisor A’s] abusive behavior.” Id. ¶ 133. Nevertheless, both\n\nPeters and McCall allege that following these complaints, nothing changed and presumably\n\nSupervisor A’s abusive conduct continued. Even assuming that these allegations are timely, they\n\nare insufficient to support a claim of retaliation for several reasons.\n\n       First, the Court finds that Peters and McCall’s complaints to Supervisor C and D do not\n\nclearly constitute protected activity. While informal complaints to management may constitute\n\nprotected activity, the plaintiffs must clearly complain about discriminatory treatment. While the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint suggests that Peters and McCall complained to management about\n\nSupervisor A assigning them too many cases and then penalizing them for a backlog when other\n\ncaseworkers were not penalized, they do not allege that they complained about being targeted for\n\nthis harsher treatment due to their race, age or national origin or even in retaliation for their prior\n\ncomplaints about her.\n\n       Second, the fact that nothing changed after they complained in 2008 and 2009 about\n\nSupervisor A to Supervisors C and D undercuts their claims of retaliation. According to the\n\nallegations, even after they complained, “the abuse” from Supervisor A continued in the form of\n\n\n\n                                             Page 61 of 94\n\ftoo many cases and the imposition of performance penalties for their backlogs. In other words,\n\ntheir allegations do not even suggest that following their complaints, Supervisor A became more\n\nhostile, penalized them more severely or assigned them even more cases than before their\n\ncomplaints as retaliation for their complaints.\n\n       Third, the adverse employment actions that Peters and McCall allege to have stemmed\n\nfrom their 2008 and 2009 complaints to Supervisors C and D do not appear to be causally\n\nconnected, even if those complaints were deemed to be protected activity. The allegations can\n\nbe construed to identify three adverse employment actions: denial of transfers, unfair penalties\n\nfor their backlogs of cases and constructive discharge or transfer. The defendant argues that “the\n\nComplaint itself shows there was a legitimate reason for the purportedly retaliatory acts.” Def.’s\n\nMem. at 19. Specifically, the defendant contends that the Complaint’s acknowledgement of the\n\nsurge in reported child abuse and neglect cases following the January 2008 Jacks tragedy\n\nprovides “a legitimate nondiscriminatory . . . reason for the increased workload that was entirely\n\ndivorced from any alleged protected activity.” Id. at 20. The defendant is correct.\n\n       Regarding the denial of transfer requests from both Peters and McCall, Compl. ¶¶ 89,\n\n134, it is not entirely clear whether this allegation is meant to indicate an adverse employment\n\naction. Assuming it is so intended, however, it does not suffice. The denial of their transfer\n\nrequests at a time when CPS was handling a “surge in child abuse and neglect reports,” id. ¶ 76,\n\nand at least one co-plaintiff Augustine Ekwem alleges that he had too many caseworkers to\n\nsupervise, id. ¶¶ 473-78, more plausibly appears to have been a reasonable management decision\n\nunder the circumstances, rather than a retaliatory act. Denial of requests for transfer, without any\n\nallegation that requiring an employee to stay in an assigned position for which the objective\n\nterms of pay, rank, and general tasks have remained the same, simply do not constitute an\n\n\n\n                                           Page 62 of 94\n\fadverse action to support a retaliation claim. See Bright v. Copps, No. 08-0755, 2011 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 142160, at *40 (D.D.C. Dec. 9, 2011) (plaintiff’s claim that she was denied\n\nreassignment, without identifying any “objectively tangible harm” resulting from defendant’s\n\nrefusal to reassign her, was not enough to show “how this denial could possibly dissuade a\n\nreasonable worker from ‘making or supporting a charge of discrimination.’”); Dorns v. Geithner,\n\n692 F. Supp. 2d 119, 132-34 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding that refusal of transfer request, poor\n\nperformance review, refusal to permit attendance at training session and denial of advancement\n\nfor sick leave, did not in aggregate constitute adverse employment action).\n\n       Regarding the assignment of cases and penalties for backlogs, it is not plausible to view\n\nthese as retaliatory acts given the other allegations in the Second Amended Complaint. Peters\n\nalleges that she was assigned an “overwhelming number of cases” and admits that her backlog\n\nwas growing and she “could not eliminate” it. Compl. ¶¶ 79-84. Likewise, McCall had a\n\ngrowing backlog and an “overwhelming caseload.” Id. ¶¶ 127-29. Both Peters and McCall were\n\nlong-term CPS employees and therefore it is reasonable that management would expect them to\n\nbe able to handle more cases than less experienced caseworkers. While Peters and McCall may\n\nperceive that they were treated more harshly than others in the unit, the job performance\n\npenalties meted out to them due to their backlogs were not unfounded and other allegations in the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint undercut their claim that they were the only caseworkers with, and\n\npenalized for, their backlogs. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 176-84, 215-17. See also Lester v. Natsios,\n\n290 F. Supp. 2d 11, 29-30 (D.D.C. 2003) (“[I]ncreased workloads and undesirable work\n\nassignments of which plaintiff complains also do not rise to the level of adverse employment\n\nactions . . . but rather constitute only the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, which employees\n\nshould expect.”) (internal quotations omitted); Mack v. Strauss, 134 F. Supp. 2d 103, 113\n\n\n\n                                           Page 63 of 94\n\f(D.D.C. 2001), aff’d, No. 01-5122, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 24097 (D.C. Cir.

Duffey, 199\n\nF.R.D. 14, 21 (D.D.C. 2001) (holding that plaintiff had not shown an adverse employment action\n\nsufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation based upon, inter alia, the assignment of\n\n“a disproportionate amount of work” to him in a “pattern of ‘deliberate overloading,’” combined\n\nwith plaintiff’s unhappiness over supervisor’s personnel assignments and written reprimand); see\n\nalso Mungin v. Katten Muchin & Zavis, 116 F.3d 1549, 1557 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (“[C]hanges in\n\nassignments or work-related duties do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions.”).\n\n       Finally, Peters and McCall appear to assert that the manner in which they left CPS was an\n\nadverse employment action caused by the retaliatory action of Supervisor A. Peters alleges that\n\nshe resigned due to Supervisor A writing her up “multiple times until the warnings lead [sic] to a\n\nreprimand and the reprimand lead [sic] to a proposed suspension in October 2009.” Compl. ¶ 87.\n\nMcCall alleges he transferred out of CPS when Supervisor D advised him that he was facing a\n\n“[write-up].” Id. ¶ 138. The causal links between Peters’ resignation and McCall’s decision to\n\ntransfer and the retaliatory acts are too tenuous, however. McCall never alleges that he\n\ncomplained about Supervisor D, who was about to issue the write-up. See Perry v. Clinton, No.\n\n08-cv-1216, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147034, at *62 (D.D.C. Aug. 29, 2011) (holding no causal\n\nlink established between protected activity and retaliation when plaintiff “provided no evidence\n\nor argument explaining why [supervisor] would decide to retaliate against her because she filed a\n\ncomplaint against someone else.”) (emphasis in original). Moreover, Supervisor A’s case\n\nassignments and reprimands for backlogs to both plaintiffs had occurred before they complained\n\nabout these actions and the fact that these actions continued unabated after their complaints does\n\n\n\n                                            Page 64 of 94\n\fnot show that they were retaliatory, but more plausibly that they were a result of the surge in\n\nchild abuse cases and increased performance pressure under which CPS and its management\n\nwere operating after the Jacks tragedy.\n\n        In any event, the defendant contests Peters and McCall’s claims that her resignation and\n\nhis transfer were involuntary and constitute a constructive discharge and a “constructive\n\ninvoluntary transfer,” respectively. The defendant contends neither plaintiff has alleged a work\n\nenvironment so intolerable that resignation or transfer was the fitting response or that their\n\nalleged mistreatment was because of their “membership in a protected class.” Def.’s Mem. at\n\n18-19. In circumstances, as here, “where a plaintiff has failed to state a hostile working\n\nenvironment,” the defendant concludes, “he or she simply cannot state a claim for constructive\n\ndischarge” or constructive involuntary transfer. Id. at 18. The Court agrees. Sewell v. Hugler,\n\nNo. 08-5079, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 4136, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 25, 2009) (unpublished) (“[T]he\n\ndistrict court correctly concluded that the failure of Sewell’s constructive discharge claim\n\nfollows a fortiori from the failure of her other claims” of hostile work environment.); McKeithan\n\nv. Boarman, 803 F. Supp. 2d 63, 70 n.5 (D.D.C. Aug. 17, 2011) (“[B]ecause [plaintiff] has failed\n\nto show that his working environment was hostile, he cannot establish that he was constructively\n\ndischarged.”); Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 968 F.2d 427, 430 (5th Cir. 1992), aff’d on other\n\ngrounds, 511 U.S. 244 (to prove constructive discharge, the plaintiff must “demonstrate a greater\n\nseverity or pervasiveness of harassment than the minimum required to prove a hostile working\n\nenvironment.”). To the extent that Peters seeks to use her resignation and McCall use his\n\ntransfer to show the requisite adverse employment action to support their retaliation claims, the\n\neffort is unavailing.\n\n        For these reasons, the retaliation claims of Peters and McCall must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                            Page 65 of 94\n\f                 b.       Retaliation Claim of Plaintiff Moore\n\n        Plaintiff Moore alleges four instances in which she complained about mistreatment from\n\nher supervisors: (1) in 2001, she complained to “human resources” about Supervisor F after this\n\nsupervisor requested that Moore not speak at a meeting and screamed at her, and Moore’s\n\ncomplaint prompted an apology from this supervisor, Compl. ¶¶ 257-59; (2) in 2005, she\n\ncomplained to “human resources” and the “Employee Assistance Program” about Supervisor G\n\nscreaming at her, id. ¶¶ 269-72; (3) in 2007, she complained to “human resources” about\n\nSupervisor G’s poor evaluation of her based on “the fact that [she] had filed complaints against\n\nhim with human resources,” id. ¶¶ 280-81; and (4) in 2009, she complained to Supervisor D\n\nabout retaliatory treatment from her prior Supervisors G and F, and Moore alleges that\n\nSupervisor D then “became abusive as well.” Id. ¶¶ 297-99.\n\n        The Complaint is not clear whether Moore claims that all four instances in which she\n\ncomplained about her three supervisors over the course of eight years is protected activity that\n\nprompted retaliation. Since she filed her EEOC charge on December 8, 2009, however, any\n\nclaims of retaliation occurring prior to February 11, 2009 are time-barred. Neither party\n\naddresses the timeliness issue in any detail, however. Indeed, the plaintiffs’ opposition\n\nmemorandum focuses on the first three instances of her complaints to human resources.\n\nSpecifically, Moore asserts that her claim of retaliation is established because, after lodging her\n\ncomplaints, presumably in 2001, 2005 and 2007, about Supervisors G and F, “she was\n\ntransferred to a non-supervisory position; and there is a causal link between her complaint[s]\n\nabout [those supervisors] and her detail to a non-supervisory position.” Pls.’ Mem. at 24. 31\n\n\n31\n  Moore does not appear to contend that her alleged constructive discharge was an adverse employment action in\nretaliation for her complaints about her supervisors. Indeed, the multiple years between her complaints about\n\n                                                 Page 66 of 94\n\fEven if the Court were to assume this claim was timely, Moore has not sufficiently alleged\n\nprotected activity or a causal link to support her retaliation claim.\n\n        This Circuit has made clear that, “[n]ot every complaint garners its author protection\n\nunder Title VII.” Broderick, 437 F.3d at 1232 (plaintiff’s written complaint to her supervisors\n\ndid not constitute a protected activity because she complained of her treatment but did not allege\n\nthat she was suffering discrimination or retaliation); see also Lewis v. District of Columbia, No.\n\n07-0429, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93299, at *34-35 (D.D.C. Sept. 8, 2010) (plaintiff’s retaliation\n\nclaim dismissed since her complaints of mistreatment do not qualify as protected activity absent\n\nany allegation that these complaints contained allegations of discrimination or retaliation);\n\nBeyene v. Hilton Hotels Corp., No. 08-1972, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112227, at *23-24 (D.D.C.\n\nSept. 30, 2011) (plaintiff “must demonstrate that he complained of some unlawful discrimination\n\nbased on his membership in a protected class” and, absent allegation that his complaint about\n\nsupervisors’ harassment referred to his religion or national origin, his retaliation claim fails).\n\nThe Second Amended Complaint contains no allegation that when Moore complained to human\n\nresources about her mistreatment by Supervisors G and F, she stated that she was being\n\ndiscriminated against. “While no ‘magic words’ are required, the complaint must in some way\n\nallege unlawful discrimination, not just frustrated ambition,” to qualify as protected activity.\n\nBroderick, 437 F.3d at 1232. Moore has failed to meet this requirement.\n\n\n\n\nSupervisors F and G and her resignation would defeat any causal connection between those events. Moreover, her\nclaim of constructive discharge stems from her allegation that her job responsibilities were removed following her\nreturn from a four month leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FLMA). Id. ¶¶ 303-11. When she\nrequested the leave, her supervisor “told Ms. Moore that her request would not be approved.” Id. ¶ 304.\nNevertheless, Moore took the leave, returning to work in October, 2009 to “discover[] that [CFSA] had stopped her\npaychecks, removed her name from the computer system, and given her position, office and staff to a newly hired\nemployee.” Id. ¶ 308. There is no allegation that Moore’s leave request was denied for any discriminatory reason or\nthat any other similarly situated supervisors were granted leave requests when her request was denied. Taking a\nleave for an extended period of four months after a supervisor has communicated that the leave was not approved\nprovides a legitimate reason for the actions taken by CFSA and would defeat her claim of constructive discharge.\n\n                                                  Page 67 of 94\n\f        Even assuming that the complaints Moore made to human resources in 2001, 2005 and\n\n2007 preceding her detail as a “hotline caseworker,” were timely and statutorily protected\n\nactivity, she would still fail to state a cognizable retaliation claim for two reasons. First, her\n\ntemporary detail does not constitute an adverse employment action. The Second Amended\n\nComplaint is replete with allegations about the surge in child abuse and neglect reports after the\n\nJacks tragedy that overwhelmed the caseworkers at CPS with backlogged cases. Moore was one\n\nof four supervisors re-assigned to CPS to assist with this surge in cases. While Moore alleges\n\nthat she was the only such supervisor demoted to caseworker, she does not allege that her pay\n\nwas docked or her benefits diminished in any way or that this temporary re-assignment had any\n\npractical consequences. See Mungin, 116 F.3d at 1557 (“[C]hanges in assignments or work-\n\nrelated duties do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment actions if unaccompanied by a\n\ndecrease in salary or work hour changes.”); Ndondji v. Inerpark Inc., 768 F. Supp. 2d. 264, 282\n\n(D.D.C. 2011) (transfer to undesirable location was not materially adverse employment action\n\nsince plaintiff did not allege any “’objectively tangible harm’ such as a decrease in salary or\n\nbenefits”); Martin v. Locke, 659 F. Supp. 2d 140, 148 (D.D.C. 2009) (finding plaintiff failed to\n\nshow that her job transfer constituted an adverse employment action when she did not allege her\n\npay or grade was reduced). The fact that she felt “humiliated” is unfortunate but does not turn\n\nthis event into an adverse employment action. See Baird, 662 F.3d at 1249 (alleged episodes are\n\n“akin to the sort of ‘public humiliation or loss of reputation’ that . . . fall[] below the\n\nrequirements for an adverse employment action”).\n\n        Even if the tangible benefits remain the same, a transfer that involves the permanent\n\nwithdrawal of an employee’s supervisory responsibilities may amount to a demotion and an\n\nadverse employment action. See Geleta v. Gray, 645 F.3d 408, 412 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (materially\n\n\n\n                                             Page 68 of 94\n\fadverse employment action due to retaliation may be shown where plaintiff provides evidence\n\nthat he was transferred from supervisory position overseeing twenty employees to a desk job\n\nwhere he supervised no one); Pardo-Kronemann v. Donovan, 601 F.3d 599, 608 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2010) (allegedly retaliatory transfer from a legal to non-legal job could qualify as an adverse\n\nemployment action); Czekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d 360, 364 (D.C. Cir. 2007). By contrast to\n\nthese cited cases, however, Moore’s transfer was not permanent. Furthermore, in the context of\n\nthe serious workload increase that CPS faced, as described by the plaintiffs in their Complaint,\n\nthe legitimate reasons for management’s temporary re-assignment of Moore to assist in\n\naddressing the serious surge in reports of child neglect and abuse, appears to have been\n\nappropriate. Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1191 (courts should not engage in “judicial micromanagement\n\nof business practices by second-guessing employers’ decisions.”) (citation omitted). In fact,\n\nMoore alleges that she was very effective in her detailed position and “closed approximately a\n\nthousand investigations.” Compl. ¶ 290. Rather than a discriminatory or retaliatory action, her\n\ntemporary re-assignment appears to have been a sound administrative step to make effective use\n\nof personnel to deal with a significant workload problem. Moreover, Moore was reinstated to\n\nher supervisory position one year after her detail and “given a staff.” Compl. ¶ 292. This is\n\nprobative evidence that the management decision to give her a temporary detail did not have\n\ninvidious motivation since that would be inconsistent with the decision to reinstate her. In other\n\nwords, her claim is “seriously undercut” by the allegation that the same managers who\n\ndiscriminated against her also reinstated her. Waterhouse v. District of Columbia, 298 F.3d 989,\n\n996 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (attributing racial animus to person who hired plaintiff “seriously undercut”\n\nclaim that plaintiff was terminated on account of her race); see also Vatel v. Alliance of Auto.\n\nMfrs., 627 F.3d 1245, 1247 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (fact that employer initially selected plaintiff “is\n\n\n\n                                           Page 69 of 94\n\fprobative evidence that [employer] did not discriminate against [plaintiff] on account of her race\n\nor gender when he dismissed her later that year”).\n\n       Second, the complaints she made in 2001, 2005 and 2007 to human resources are not\n\nclose in time to when she was detailed to be a caseworker. This undermines significantly any\n\ncausal link between the purported protected activity and the allegedly retaliatory temporary re-\n\nassignment.\n\n       In sum, Moore has failed to allege that she engaged in protected activity and, even if she\n\ndid, her temporary re-assignment does not constitute an adverse employment action, let alone a\n\nretaliatory act caused by her complaints, sufficient to state a claim for retaliation.\n\n       Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss the claims of retaliation by Plaintiffs\n\nPeters, McCall and Moore is granted.\n\n       E.      Constitutional Claims Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1981\n\n       The plaintiffs assert discrimination claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1981, “which do\n\nnot require administrative exhaustion.” Pls.’ Mem. at 11. Specifically, the Second Amended\n\nComplaint states that “Defendants[’] acts, policies, practices and procedures . . . violated\n\nPlaintiffs’ rights secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S.\n\nConstitution.” Compl., Prayer for Relief at 58(a). Evaluation of the factual allegations pertinent\n\nto each of these constitutional claims asserted on behalf of all nine plaintiffs would be a\n\nchallenge since, as the defendant points out, “[p]laintiffs make no effort to tie these claims to a\n\nspecific statute.” Def.’s Mem. at 12. Nevertheless, the claims suffer the fatal flaw of not\n\nsufficiently alleging a custom or practice of the municipality to support them.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Page 70 of 94\n\f        1.      Legal Standard\n\n        Section 1983 authorizes equitable relief and compensatory damages against “[e]very\n\nperson who, under color of any [law] . . . custom, or usage, of any State or . . . the District of\n\nColumbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected . . . any . . . person . . . to the deprivation of any\n\nrights . . . secured by the Constitution and laws . . . .” 42 U.S.C. §1983. To state a claim under\n\nsection 1983, plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to show not just a constitutional violation, but\n\nthat the District of Columbia had a policy or custom that caused the alleged violation of their\n\nconstitutional rights. Jones v. Horne, 634 F.3d 588, 601 (D.C. Cir. 2011); Warren v. District of\n\nColumbia, 353 F.3d 36, 38-39 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see also Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of N.Y.,\n\n436 U.S. 658, 690-91 (1978); Garnes-El v. District of Columbia, No. 08-2233, 2012 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 8961, at *8 (D.D.C. Jan. 25, 2012). The District, as a municipal corporation, is a\n\n“person” for purposes of section 1983 liability. Plaintiffs may show causation exists in several\n\nways: (1) if “the municipality or one of its policymakers explicitly adopted the policy that was\n\n‘the moving force of the constitutional violation’” id. at 20 (quoting Warren, 353 F.3d at 39); (2)\n\nif “a policymaker . . . knowingly ignore[d] a practice that was consistent enough to constitute\n\ncustom,” Warren, 353 F.3d at 39 (citation omitted); or (3) if the District government failed to\n\nrespond “‘to a need . . . in such a manner as to show deliberate indifference to the risk that not\n\naddressing the need will result in constitutional violations.’” Warren, 353 F.3d at 39 (quoting\n\nBaker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003)) (internal quotation marks\n\nremoved). The D.C. Circuit has made clear that causation involves more than mere negligence,\n\nand “means that, faced with actual or constructive knowledge that its agents will probably violate\n\nconstitutional rights, the [District government] may not adopt a policy of inaction.” Warren, 353\n\nF.3d at 39.\n\n\n\n                                             Page 71 of 94\n\f       A cause of action under § 1981 may be brought when a plaintiff has suffered an injury\n\nflowing from the racially-motivated breach of his contractual relationship with another party.\n\nDomino’s Pizza v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 480 (2006). Violation of the rights guaranteed by §\n\n1981 by state entities can be remedied exclusively through the cause of action for damages\n\ncreated by § 1983. Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 733 (1989). To prevail on a\n\nclaim under § 1981 against the District, therefore, a plaintiff must show that the violation of his\n\n“‘right to make contracts’ protected by § 1981 was caused by a custom or policy within the\n\nmeaning of Monell and subsequent cases.” Id. at 735-36; Hamilton v. District of Columbia, 720\n\nF. Supp. 2d 102, 113-14 (D.D.C. 2010).\n\n       2.      Analysis\n\n       The plaintiffs’ allegations do not establish that a custom, policy or practice of the District\n\nof Columbia caused their alleged injuries, which is fatal to their claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981\n\nand 1983. Other than conclusory allegations in the prefatory section of the Second Amended\n\nComplaint, the plaintiffs do not allege that any District official explicitly condoned, knowingly\n\nignored, or failed to respond in a manner showing deliberate indifference to discriminatory\n\nactivity based on race, age or national origin within CFSA. On the contrary, the allegations\n\nmake clear that steps were taken to address perceived or overt discriminatory activity at CFSA.\n\nFor example, when employees complained of abusive conduct on the part of Supervisor A,\n\nSupervisor B convened a meeting about the complaints and assured employees, including some\n\nof the plaintiffs, that there would be no retaliation. Compl. ¶¶ 71-72, ¶¶ 119-22. Similarly, when\n\na Nigerian caseworker and African-American employee had an altercation in the workplace and\n\nyelled racial epithets, “both workers were suspended.” Id. ¶¶ 536-40. When Moore complained\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 72 of 94\n\fabout Supervisor F’s conduct towards her in 2001, Supervisor F was prompted to apologize to\n\nher. Id. ¶ 259.\n\n        Moreover, among the plaintiffs are several supervisors and management personnel who\n\nallege expressly that they took actions to stop any perceived discrimination or retaliation. For\n\nexample, plaintiff Courts-Marshall, who was “put in charge of the Child Protective Services\n\nAdministration at the Child and Family Services Agency,” id. ¶ 570, alleges that she “refused to\n\nfire any of the people on the list” whom she believed were put on the list “for retaliatory\n\nreasons.” Id. ¶¶ 617-18. She also instructed “program managers,” who are mid-level\n\nmanagement at CFSA, to help “supervisors whose names were on the list.” Id. ¶ 620. In fact,\n\nshe alleges that she “launched a campaign to make sure that all social workers had the training\n\nand support they needed to perform their jobs.” Id. ¶ 619. In addition, plaintiff Meade was a\n\ntraining supervisor in CPS and she claims that “Human Resources offered diversity training on\n\ntopics like race discrimination and sexual harassment . . .” Id. ¶ 514. These allegations make\n\nclear that the District did not have a custom or policy that caused any alleged injuries of the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n        Accordingly, the plaintiffs’ discrimination claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1981\n\ncannot be sustained and will be dismissed.\n\n        F.        District of Columbia Human Rights Act Claims\n\n        The Second Amended Complaint asserts that the plaintiffs notified the Mayor’s office of\n\nthe instant civil action against the city on December 21, 2009, and that the “District of Columbia\n\nGovernment’s Office of Risk Management reviewed the claims, determined that none were tort\n\nissues, and closed the files.” Compl. ¶ 5. Among the claims asserted is one for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief and damages to protect and redress “deprivation of rights secured by the District\n\nof Columbia Human Rights Act of 1977” (“DCHRA”). Id. ¶ 12. The defendant argues that the\n\n                                            Page 73 of 94\n\fplaintiffs failed to comply with the notice requirements of D.C. Code § 12-309, which operates\n\nas a six-month statute of limitations for certain claims asserted against the District of Columbia.\n\nand therefore plaintiffs’ DCHRA claims should be dismissed. 32\n\n         The defendant is correct that D.C. Code § 12-309 operates as a six-month statute of\n\nlimitations for certain claims asserted against the District of Columbia. It is well settled that\n\nstate law notice requirements apply only to state law claims and do not bar federal question\n\nclaims. Morton v. District of Columbia Hous. Auth., 720 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing\n\nDaskalea v. District of Columbia, 227 F.3d 433, 446 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“The six-month notice\n\nrequirement of the D.C. Code does not apply to plaintiff’s claim under section 1983.”)); Candido\n\nv. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 151, 158-59 (D.D.C. 2007) (holding that the notice\n\nrequirement of D.C. Code § 12-309 does not bar federal due process claim)). Thus, the only\n\nclaim asserted by plaintiffs subject to D.C. Code § 12-309 is the DCHRA claim.\n\n         D.C. Code § 12-309 provides that:\n                  An action may not be maintained against the District of Columbia\n                  for unliquidated damages to person or property unless, within six\n                  months after the injury or damage was sustained, the claimant, his\n                  agent, or attorney has given notice in writing to the Mayor of the\n                  District of Columbia of the approximate time, place, cause, and\n                  circumstances of the injury or damage. A report in writing by the\n                  Metropolitan Police Department, in regular course of duty, is a\n                  sufficient notice under this section.\n         Here, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on October 28, 2009 and filed their first amended\n\ncomplaint, which added several new plaintiffs, on December 10, 2009. According to their\n\nSecond Amended Complaint, plaintiffs allege that they “notified the Mayor’s Office of this civil\n\n\n32\n  A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) rather than Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is\nappropriate because “Section 12-309 is not jurisdictional . . . Unlike a jurisdictional bar, the Section 12-309 ground\nfor dismissal of an action is simply a ‘penalty for noncompliance.’” Blocker-Burnette v. District of Columbia,\n730 F. Supp. 2d 200, 202 & n.2 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting Sanders v. District of Columbia, No. 97-1238, 2002 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 6818, at *5 (Apr. 15, 2002)).\n\n\n                                                   Page 74 of 94\n\faction against the District of Columbia on December 21, 2009.” Compl. ¶ 5. However, a party\n\nmust provide notice under § 12-309 prior to filing a lawsuit. See Campbell v. District of\n\nColumbia, 568 A.2d 1076, 1077-78 (D.C. 1990) (holding that “notice must have been given\n\nbefore suit”); McGee v. District of Columbia, 646 F. Supp. 2d 115, 121 (D.D.C. 2009) (“[T]he\n\nclaims . . . are barred because the plaintiff did not provide notice to the mayor until after filing\n\nhis lawsuit.”). Any notice provided on December 21, 2009, therefore, would not satisfy the\n\nrequirements of D.C. Code § 12-309.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that D.C. Code § 12-309 only applies to “personal injury and property\n\ndamage claims,” Pls.’ Mem. at 29, but courts have specifically held that D.C. Code § 12-309\n\napplies to DCHRA actions. See Giardino v. District of Columbia, 252 F.R.D. 18, 23 (D.D.C.\n\n2008); see also Owens v. District of Columbia, 993 A.2d 1085, 1087-89 (D.C. 2010).\n\nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ claims under the DCHRA must be dismissed.\n\nV.      PLAINTIFFS-INTERVENORS’ MOTIONS TO INTERVENE\n        The plaintiffs seek to double the number of plaintiffs in this suit with two motions to\n\npermit nine additional current or former employees of CFSA to intervene as plaintiffs of right,\n\nunder either Rule 24(a)(2), or permissively, under Rule 24(b). FED. R. CIV. P. 24; Movants’ Mot.\n\nto Intervene, ECF No. 24 (“First Motion”); Movants’ Second Mot. to Intervene, ECF No. 27\n\n(“Second Motion”). 33 Since the Court has granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss the Second\n\nAmended Complaint, the motions to intervene must be denied as moot. Even if any part of the\n\noriginal claims remained, the motions to intervene would be denied on the merits for the reasons\n\nset forth below.\n\n\n33\n  The Court notes that the First Motion seeks intervention “pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a),” yet asks for\n“permissive intervention as plaintiffs in this action.” First Motion, at 1. The Second Motion simply does not\nspecify under which prong of Rule 24 the Movants seek to intervene. Second Motion, at 1-3. Nevertheless, the\nCourt construes these motions as seeking intervention both as of right and permissively. See Movants’ Reply Mem.,\nECF No. 26, at 1 (clarifying that Movants are seeking intervention under Rule 24(a) “and/or” Rule 24 (b)).\n\n                                                 Page 75 of 94\n\f       The defendant opposes both of the motions to intervene.

The defendant contends that the nine would-be\n\nplaintiff-intervenors (“Movants”) should not be granted leave to intervene since the allegations\n\nunderlying their claims are sufficiently different that the requirements for intervention under both\n\nRule 24(a)(2) and (b) are not satisfied. The Court agrees.\n\n       In the discussion that follows, the Court will first review the legal standards applicable to\n\nboth prongs of Rule 24 and then describe in detail the Movants’ claims, in order to evaluate the\n\ndifferences in those claims from those of the plaintiffs, since those differences are the basis for\n\nthe defendant’s objection to these motions. Finally, the Court will assess the merits of the\n\nmotions for intervention based upon the applicable legal standards.\n\n       A.      Legal Standard For Intervention\n       Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the requirements for both\n\nintervention as of right and permissive intervention. See FED. R. CIV. P. 24 (a) & (b). While\n\n“[i]n theory” a court has “no discretion when intervention is under Rule 24(a),” 7C Wright,\n\nMiller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure, § 1913 (3d ed. 2007), practically speaking, even\n\nthis basis for intervention involves “a measure of judicial discretion . . . .” Fund for Animals v.\n\nNorton, 322 F.3d 728, 732 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover v. United\n\nStates, 118 F.3d 776, 779 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (noting “the existence of district court discretion over\n\nthe timeliness and adequacy of representation issues under Rule 24(a)(2)”)). If there is no right\n\nto intervene under Rule 24(a), “it is wholly discretionary with the court whether to allow\n\nintervention under Rule 24(b),” but only if the movant ‘has a claim or defense that shares with\n\nthe main action a common question of law or fact.’” 7C Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice\n\n& Procedure, § 1913 (3d ed. 2007) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 24(b)(1)(B)). The movants’ motions\n\n                                            Page 76 of 94\n\fwill be considered under each prong of Rule 24.\n\n               1.      Intervention of Right\n\n       Rule 24(a)(2) states in relevant part:\n\n       On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who . . . claims an\n       interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is\n       so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede\n       the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately\n       represent that interest.\n\n       The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has parsed the language of Rule 24(a)(2) to\n\nrequire four factors in order for a movant to qualify for intervention of right: “(1) the timeliness\n\nof the motion; (2) whether the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction\n\nwhich is the subject of the action; (3) whether the applicant is so situated that the disposition of\n\nthe action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant’s ability to protect that\n\ninterest; and (4) whether the applicant’s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.”\n\nFund for Animals, 322 F.3d at 731 (quoting Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1074\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1998)); Karsner v. Lothian, 532 F.3d 876, 885 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Additionally, the\n\nproposed intervenor seeking to participate on equal footing with the original parties to the suit\n\nmust demonstrate standing under Article III of the Constitution. Jones v. Prince George’s Cnty.,\n\n348 F.3d 1014, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“[P]rospective intervenors in this circuit must possess\n\nstanding under Article III of the Constitution.”); Norton, 322 F.3d at 731-32; United States v.\n\nPhilip Morris USA, 566 F.3d 1095, 1146 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA,\n\n274 F.R.D. 305, 308 (D.D.C. 2011); In re ESA Litig., 270 F.R.D. 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2010).\n\n       To establish standing under Article III, a prospective intervenor must show: (1) he or she\n\nhas suffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent,\n\nnot conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the\n\n\n\n                                            Page 77 of 94\n\fdefendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed\n\nby a favorable decision. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); Sierra\n\nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The requisite showing for standing of injury-\n\nin-fact and causation are closely related to the second and third factors under Rule 24(a), which\n\nrequire a showing of interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit and the potential impairment of\n\nthat interest absent intervention in the suit. See, e.g., Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 333\n\nF.3d 228, 233 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“[A]ny person who satisfies Rule 24(a) will also meet Article\n\nIII’s standing requirement.”); Defenders of Wildlife v. Jackson, No. 10-1915, 2012 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 35750, at *10 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2012) (noting that outcome is the same whether standing\n\nis considered separately or as part of Rule 24(a)(2) interest requirements); Akiachak Native Cmty.\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 584 F. Supp. 2d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2008) (“The standing inquiry is repetitive\n\nin the case of intervention as of right because an intervenor who satisfies Rule 24(a) will also\n\nhave Article III standing.”).\n\n               2.      Permissive Intervention\n       Rule 24(b) authorizes permissive intervention for a movant who timely files a motion\n\nwhere a federal statute confers a conditional right to intervene or the applicant’s claim or defense\n\nhas a question of law or fact in common with the main action. District of Columbia v. Potomac\n\nElec. Power Co., No. 11-282, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138317, at *8-9 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2011)\n\n(citing Envt’l. Def. v. Leavitt, 329 F. Supp. 2d 55, 65 (D.D.C. 2004) and FED. R. CIV. P. 24(b)).\n\nUnder Rule 24(b)(2), a would-be intervenor must show “(1) an independent ground for subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction; (2) a timely motion; and (3) a claim or defense that has a question of law or\n\nfact in common with the main action.’” Potomac Elec. Power Co., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n138317, at *8 (citing EEOC v. Nat’l Children’s Ctr., 146 F.3d 1042, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1998))\n\n\n\n                                            Page 78 of 94\n\f(internal quotations omitted). 34 As previously noted, the decision to allow permissive\n\nintervention under Rule 24(b) is committed to the district court’s discretion. Id. (citing Nat’l\n\nChildren’s Ctr., 146 F.3d at 1046, 1048). In exercising its discretion to allow permissive\n\nintervention, the Court must consider whether the proposed intervention “will unduly delay or\n\nprejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.” FED. R. CIV. P. 24(b).\n\n         B.       The Movants’ Claims\n         The nine Movants include seven former CFSA employees (Patricia Ivey, Delores\n\nJunious, Emmanuael Mbadiugha, Sophia Mickens-Lewis, Nicky Odaka, Njideka Odiana and\n\nFidelia Phillips) and two current CFSA employees (Nellie Lahia and Edwin Monono). Unlike\n\nthe plaintiffs, who complain about their treatment while employed at CPS, only three of the\n\nMovants (Ivey, Lahai, Mickens-Lewis) were employed within this component of the CFSA. The\n\nother six Movants complain about their treatment in the following components of CFSA: In-\n\nHome and Reunification Services, the Family Stabilization Branch, and the Licensing &\n\nMonitoring Division. Only one of the Movants served as a CFSA supervisor or manager\n\n(Mickens-Lewis) and the remainder are non-managerial employees. The Movants were\n\nemployed at CFSA for varying lengths of time, ranging from about eighteen years to only a few\n\nyears. As with the nine plaintiffs, all nine of the Movants claim that they were discriminated\n\nagainst on the basis of race and subjected to a hostile work environment during at least some\n\nportion of their employment at CFSA. In addition, six of the Movants (Junious, Mbadiugha,\n\nMickens-Lewis, Monono, Odiana and Phillips) claim retaliation; six Movants (Lahia,\n\nMbadiugha, Monono, Odaka, Odiana and Phillips) claim discrimination on the basis of national\n\norigin; and two Movants (Mbadiugha and Monono) claim age discrimination.\n\n34\n  Whether standing is also required for permissive intervention in this Circuit is an unresolved issue. See In re\nVitamins Antitrust Class Actions, 215 F.3d 26, 31-32 (D.C. Cir. 2000); In re Endangered Species Act Section 4\nDeadline Litig., 277 F.R.D. 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2011); In re ESA Litig., 270 F.R.D. 1, 6, n.5 (D.D.C. 2010).\n\n                                                   Page 79 of 94\n\f       According to documents submitted by the plaintiffs, Phillips has received an EEOC right-\n\nto-sue letter and three other unnamed Movants have filed charges with the EEOC but have not\n\nyet received their right-to-sue letters. Pls.’ EEOC Docs., ECF No. 30. Apparently, the five other\n\nMovants have not filed complaints with the EEOC, let alone exhausted any administrative\n\nremedy.\n\n       The Title VII and ADEA discrimination claims asserted by each Movant are summarized\n\nin the chart below.\n\nMovant –        Discrimination based upon:                       Hostile Work     Retaliation\nCFSA             Race     National                               Environment\nComponent       (Black) Origin          Age         Gender\nMonono –        √       √             √ (53)        NO           √                √\nLicensing &             (Cameroon)\nMonitoring\nDivision\nIvey –          √        NO             NO (58)      NO          √                NO\nCPS\nOdiana-         √        √ (Nigerian)    NO (34)     NO          √                √\nIn-Home &\nReunification\nServices\nPhillips–       √        √ (Nigerian)   NO (53)      NO          √                √\nIn-Home &\nReunification\nServices\nMbadiugha–      √        √ (Nigerian)   √ (55)        NO         √                √\nIn-Home &\nReunification\nServices\nLahai–          √        √ (Sierra      NO (62)      NO          √                NO\nCPS                      Leone)\nOdaka–          √        √ (Nigerian)   NO (41)      NO          √                NO\nIn-Home &\nReunification\nServices\nJunious–        √        NO             NO (47)      NO          √                √\nFamily\nStabilization\nBranch\n\n                                          Page 80 of 94\n\fMickens-      √           NO             NO (44)       NO          √                 √\nLewis– CPS\nAdministrator\n\n       Just as the summary chart above reflects differences in the claims asserted by the\n\nMovants, the factual allegations underlying the claims of discrimination, hostile work\n\nenvironment and retaliatory actions vary among each of the nine Movants, as described in more\n\ndetail below.\n\n                1.     Non-Managerial Movants\n        Edwin Monono is a 53-year old black man from Cameroon, who worked as a CPS\n\ncaseworker in three time periods: from 1993 until 1996, from 1997 until 2001, and again from\n\n2008 through the Spring of 2009, when he was detailed from the Licensing and Monitoring\n\nDivision to CPS “due to massive backlogs following the Jacks tragedy.” First Mot., Ex. 1,\n\nCompl.-In-Intervention (“First Compl.-Int.”), ECF No. 24-1, ¶¶ 20-22, 39, 48. Monono claims\n\nracial and national origin discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation based upon\n\nallegations, inter alia, that (1) his workplace is “saturated with stereotypes about Africans being\n\ndishonest, lazy, and just it in for the money,” id. ¶ 26; (2) “American social workers made\n\nderogatory comments about the skin complexions, facial features, and accents of African\n\ncaseworkers,” id. ¶¶ 25, 27; (3) during his 2008 detail to CPS, he worked in excess of 40 hours\n\nper week but did not submit overtime pay requests because his managers accused African social\n\nworkers of “stealing overtime” and threatened African social workers with audits and\n\ndisciplinary actions; he nevertheless “wanted to continue working in [CPS],” id. ¶¶ 40-6; (4)\n\nupon his transfer back to the Licensing and Monitoring Division, he was assigned more cases\n\nthan his American co-workers, id. ¶ 49; (5) “[i]n 2010,” he complained about the “impropriety of\n\n\n\n\n                                           Page 81 of 94\n\fa particular assignment,” and was “written up” by Supervisor K, 35 id. ¶ 50; and (6) despite\n\nrequests to be transferred to other units, he remains assigned the same supervisor and “continues\n\nto be harassed,” while American caseworkers who complained about the same supervisor were\n\ntransferred, id. ¶¶ 50-53.\n\n        Patricia Ivey is a 58-year old African-American woman, who worked as a CPS\n\ncaseworker from 2005 until she resigned in August 2008. First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 55-59. Ivey\n\nclaims racial discrimination and hostile work environment, which interfered with her ability to\n\ndo her job, id. ¶¶ 97-98. Ivey provides no allegation of any action taken against her personally,\n\nbut bases her claims on her observations that (1) black caseworkers “from Africa and the\n\nCaribbean Islands, were bullied by their supervisors,” id. ¶ 61; (2) African caseworkers were\n\nwarned not to submit overtime pay requests and managers accused African social workers of\n\n“stealing overtime” and “threatened” African caseworkers with audits and disciplinary actions,\n\nid. ¶¶ 72-76; and (3) from 2005 to 2008, she observed Supervisor A “constantly harass a\n\nNigerian caseworker,” and a Jamaican caseworker, Angella Peters, whose repeated requests to be\n\ntransferred to other units were denied, id. ¶¶ 83, 86, 87-91.\n\n        Nellie Lahai is a 62-year old black woman from Sierra Leone, who has worked for\n\nCFSA for about 18 years and as a CPS caseworker from 2003 until January, 2009, when she was\n\n“involuntarily transferred” to the Licensing and Monitoring Division. Second Mot., Ex. 1,\n\nCompl.- in-Intervention, ECF No. 27-1 (“Second Compl.-Int.”), ¶¶ 11-12, 15, 59. Lahai claims\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race and national origin, retaliation and hostile work environment,\n\nbased upon allegations that (1) Supervisor H, who became CPS’ program administrator in 2004,\n\n“created a lot of racial tension at the agency,” id. ¶ 24; (2) in the Fall of 2005, Lahai filed a\n\n35\n  Supervisor K is unnamed and the Complaint provides no race or ethnic information about this supervisor.

First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 102, 103, 105, 164. She claims racial and\n\nnational origin discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation based upon allegations\n\nthat (1) between 2001 and 2003, when she was assigned to In-Home and Reunification Services,\n\nAmerican social workers hired at the same time as she were automatically promoted upon\n\ncompletion of their one-year probationary period, while Odiana was not promoted for several\n\nyears, id. ¶¶ 114-16; (2) after resigning from CFSA in 2007, she was re-hired in 2008 and\n\nassigned to In-Home and Reunification Services, instead of the assignment she expected in a\n\ncollaborative position in order to have a regular schedule for her to care for her three young\n\nchildren, id. ¶¶ 127-33; (3) in February 2009, Odiana was denied transfer to a collaborative\n\nposition until completion of a one year probationary period, even though some newly hired\n\nAmerican social workers were assigned to the collaborative position, id. ¶¶ 141-48, 151-53, 161-\n\n64; (4) after Odiana complained about not being transferred, two supervisors, Supervisor L and\n\n\n\n                                           Page 83 of 94\n\fSupervisor M, 36 wrote her up in May 2009, September, 2009, and December 2009, the last of\n\nwhich resulted in her termination, id. ¶¶ 154-64.\n\n        Fidelia Phillips is a 53-year old, black woman from Nigeria, who, like Movant Odiana,\n\nworked at CFSA’s In-Home and Reunification Services from to 2001 to 2008. First Compl.-Int.\n\n¶¶ 168-69. She claims racial and national origin discrimination, hostile work environment and\n\nretaliation based upon allegations that (1) after taking family leave, in May 2004, her Supervisor\n\nN 37 was “visibly hostile” towards her, prompting Phillips to complain to the project manager and\n\nprogram administrator about the hostile treatment, id. ¶¶ 185-91; (2) in December, 2004, a new\n\nsupervisor (“Supervisor O”) 38 was also hostile towards her but gave her a “satisfactory” job\n\nperformance with “very derogatory comments,” which prompted her to request a transfer to\n\nanother supervisor but her request was denied, while “two American caseworkers” were\n\ntransferred after complaining about Supervisor O, id. ¶¶ 194-204; (3) between 2006 and 2008,\n\nPhillips was assigned a “significantly heavier [caseload]” than her American co-workers,\n\nrequiring her to work long hours, but the agency consistently refused to approve Phillips’\n\novertime pay requests, id. ¶¶ 206-08; and (4) after a family leave in 2005, despite Supervisor O’s\n\nadvice not to file “an interim report,” Phillips was reprimanded for not having filed the report,\n\nwhich was the “first of several questionable write ups that would result in Phillips’ termination in\n\n2008,” id. ¶¶ 210-14.\n\n\n\n\n36\n  Supervisor L is Elaina McKenzie and Supervisor M is Maura Gaswirth.

First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 219-20, 223, 269. He claims racial, age and national origin\n\ndiscrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation based upon allegations that (1) black\n\ncaseworkers, particularly those from Africa and the Caribbean Islands, were bullied by their\n\nsupervisors and American social workers made derogatory comments about African workers, id.\n\n¶¶ 217-18, 246; (2) he was assigned a heavy caseload relative to his American co-workers but his\n\nsupervisors discouraged him from making overtime pay requests, id. ¶¶ 245-49; (3) in 1999, his\n\nSupervisor P 39 became hostile towards him when he left work for his child’s birth, id. ¶¶ 241-43;\n\n(4) Mbadiugha’s requests in 2003 for transfer to CPS and, in 2004, for a supervisor’s position\n\nwere denied, id. ¶¶ 248-57; (5) between 2005 and 2008, Mbadiugha was written up twice by\n\nSupervisor Q 40 for being late for a court hearing and late filings of case plans with the court,\n\neach resulting in a suspension, even though “caseworkers are rarely disciplined” for these\n\nmatters, id. ¶¶ 262-66; and (6) in 2010, Mbadiugha’s new supervisor R 41 wrote up Mbadigha for\n\nfiling case plans with the court after a deadline, which resulted in his termination, id. ¶¶ 267-69.\n\n        Nicky Odaka is a 41-year old black woman from Nigeria, who has worked for ten years\n\nas a social services assistant in CFSA’s In-Home and Reunification Services.

Mickens-Lewis complains about a hostile work\n\nenvironment during the time that her immediate supervisor was plaintiff Courts-Marshall.\n\n       Mickens-Lewis is a 44-year old African American woman, who worked in CPS as a\n\nsupervisor from 2000 to 2001, as a program manager from 2002 to 2003, as the acting program\n\nadministrator from 2003-2004, and as a program manager from 2004 to 2008, during which time\n\nin the fall of 2005, she served as the CPS acting program administrator, when Courts-Marshall\n\nwas her immediate supervisor. First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 276-85. She claims racial discrimination,\n\nhostile work environment from 2004 to 2008, and retaliation based upon allegations that (1) in\n\nJanuary 2006, the deputy director of the CFSA, Supervisor I, instructed Courts-Marshall to\n\nterminate “about 15 social workers,” but Mickens-Lewis, together with Courts-Marshall and\n\nSupervisor B, “determined that the social workers on the termination list were performing they\n\n[sic] jobs well but had complained about [Supervisor H’s] discriminatory practices,” id. ¶¶ 296-\n\n310, 326; (2) on two occasions, in 2007 and 2008, Supervisor I directed Mickens-Lewis to\n\nterminate apparently two different African caseworkers, one of whom was the subject of a “a\n\ncomplaint from a family he was investigating,” but after investigation, Mickens-Lewis refused to\n\nterminate the caseworkers, id. ¶¶ 332, 335, 351-52; and (3) in May, 2008, Supervisor I\n\nterminated Mickens-Lewis because “[y]ou all did not do what I told you to do,” id. ¶¶ 360-63.\n\n       C.      Discussion\n       The Movants argue that they should be permitted to intervene “because Intervenors and\n\nPlaintiffs share common claims against Defendant in terms of facts, evidence, and legal\n\ntheories.” First Compl.-Int., at 2. Specifically, the Movants state that both the Movants and\n\nplaintiffs allege they worked “in a hostile work environment at the Child and Family Services\n\nAgency during the past ten years. The hostile work environment was discriminatory and\n\n\n\n                                          Page 87 of 94\n\fretaliatory.” Movants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 29, at 1-2; Movants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 26, at\n\n2.\n\n         The Defendant counters that the pending motions to intervene should be denied since\n\neach Movant has “an independent right of action that he or she can pursue regardless of the\n\noutcome of this proceeding.” Def.’s Opp’n to First Mot., ECF No. 25, at 2-3; Def.’s Opp’n to\n\nSecond Mot., ECF No. 28, at 2-3. Consequently, according to the defendant, the Movants cannot\n\nmake the requisite showing that, absent intervention, their interests would be impeded or\n\nimpaired under Rule 24(a)(2). In addition, the defendant argues that permissive intervention\n\nunder Rule 24(b) should be denied because joining the Movants’ “legally distinct” claims would\n\n“expand the scope of the issues before the Court and delay the current proceedings.” Def.’s\n\nOpp’n to First Mot. at 3; Def.’s Opp’n to Second Mot. at 4. Even if these motions were not\n\nmoot, for these and other reasons discussed below, the Court agrees with the defendant that the\n\nMovants would not be permitted to intervene.\n\n         1.       Movants Would Not Be Entitled to Intervene Of Right\n         The defendant does not dispute that the Movants have standing 44 nor their satisfaction of\n\nthe first and last requirements for intervention of right under Rule 24(a)(2), and the Court agrees\n\nthat, if not moot, the Movants’ intervention motions would be timely and their interests would\n\nnot be adequately represented by the existing parties. The defendant argues only that Movants\n\ncannot meet either the second or third requirements for intervention as of right. See Def.’s\n\nOpp’n to Second Mot. at 2-3. Specifically, the defendant contends that the Movants do not have\n\n\n44\n  A prospective intervenor’s Article III standing presents a question going to this Court’s jurisdiction, which must\nbe addressed first by the Court before proceeding to consideration of the four-part test for intervention of right. See\nIn re Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litig., 277 F.R.D. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2011); see also Fund for Animals,\n322 F.3d at 732; Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The Court concludes that the Movants\nhave met the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing by showing a concrete injury causally connected to\ntheir employment at the CFSA that could be redressed by a favorable decision from this Court. See Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).\n\n                                                    Page 88 of 94\n\fan interest in the subject matter at issue in the action and that the Movants’ interests would not as\n\na practical matter be impaired or impeded by the disposition of the case. The Court agrees that\n\nthe Movants would not be able to satisfy these requirements and, therefore, their motions to\n\nintervene of right would be denied on the merits.\n\n       First, the Movants have no legally cognizable interest in the specific claims asserted by\n\nthe plaintiffs in this employment discrimination lawsuit. While the Movants may share with the\n\nplaintiffs similar legal claims against the same defendant, the factual sufficiency of each claim\n\nwould be assessed for each plaintiff and movant individually. Indeed, the Movants concede “the\n\nindividual nature of the discrimination/retaliation claims” when they argue that “the interests of\n\nthe Intervenors cannot be adequately protected by the current parties to the litigation.” First Mot.\n\nat 2; Second Mot. at 1.\n\n       Second, even if the Movants had a legally cognizable interest, that interest would not be\n\nimpaired by a judgment on the plaintiffs’ claims. Impairment exists when the decision in a\n\npending matter would foreclose or adversely affect the rights of the proposed intervenor in a\n\nsubsequent proceeding. Even if one or more plaintiffs would have prevailed with a judgment in\n\nhis or her favor, the legal interests and claims of the Movants would, as a practical matter, be\n\nunaffected. As the defendant correctly points out, each Movant has “an independent right of\n\naction that he or she can pursue regardless of the outcome of this proceeding.” Def.’s Opp’n to\n\nSecond Mot., ECF No. 28, at 3. See Shea v. Angulo, 19 F.3d 343, 347 (7th Cir. 1994) (where\n\nproposed intervenor is free to initiate own suit for recovery no matter whether plaintiff prevails,\n\nthere is no potential impairment of intervenor’s interest); In re Safeguard Scientifics, 220 F.R.D.\n\n43, 48-49 (E.D. Pa. 2004) (denying motion to intervene as of right because impairment\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 89 of 94\n\frequirement was not met where proposed intervenors “remain[ed] free to assert their claims by\n\nfiling individual civil actions against [the defendant]”).\n\n        In connection with the impairment factor, the Court is cognizant that if the Movants\n\nindividually filed their own complaints for employment discrimination, at least five may be\n\nunsuccessful. The record is bare of any evidence that five of the Movants filed a discrimination\n\ncharge with the EEOC, received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC or otherwise exhausted their\n\nadministrative remedies. Thus, if non-filing Movants attempt to file individually the claims\n\nasserted in the First and Second Complaints-in-Intervention, the effort may be futile and their\n\nclaim would be subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. This\n\nimpairment would not be due to the disposition of this action, however, but to the Movants own\n\naction or inaction and therefore is not the type of impairment that Rule 24(a) was intended to\n\nprotect against. See United States v. New York, 198 F.3d 360, 366 (2d Cir. 1999) (“Any failure\n\non their part to act within the applicable statutes of limitations does not sufficiently impair their\n\ninterests to warrant intervention under Rule 24(a)(2); rather, the harm to their interests must be\n\nattributable to the court’s disposition of the suit in which intervention is sought.”); Jones v. GES\n\nExposition Servs., No. 02-6243, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17981, at *27 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 3, 2004)\n\n(“[E]ven if the intervenors were barred from bringing a separate action . . . as to their Title VII\n\nclaims, for failure to timely file a charge . . . this would not constitute a sufficient impairment of\n\ninterests within the meaning of Rule 24(a) because the harm would not be due to the disposition\n\nof this action.”).\n\n        Indeed, the claims of the non-filing Movants would be subject to challenge for failure to\n\nexhaust their administrative remedies, just like the claims of the non-filing plaintiffs. Although\n\nneither the defendant nor the Movants address this issue, the non-filing Movants presumably\n\n\n\n                                             Page 90 of 94\n\fwould seek to excuse their failure to exhaust their administrative remedies for their employment\n\ndiscrimination claims by relying on vicarious exhaustion, just as the non-filing plaintiffs have\n\ndone. Cf. James v. England, 332 F. Supp. 2d 239, 248 (D.D.C. 2004) (“[T]he District of\n\nColumbia Circuit has permitted intervention in Title VII class action lawsuits by parties even if\n\nthey have not exhausted their administrative remedies.”). The five non-filing Movants, however,\n\nwould be no more entitled to vicarious exhaustion than the non-filing plaintiffs, for whom\n\nvicarious exhaustion is not available due to the disparate nature of their legal and factual claims,\n\nas discussed in section IV. A. 3, supra. Their divergent factual allegations make amply clear that\n\nthe EEOC could not have had notice of the Movants’ claims based upon the EEOC charges filed\n\nby the three plaintiffs who exhausted their administrative remedies. Thus, the Movants would\n\nnot be able to rely upon the “single-filing” rule to assert their claims. Accord Kifafi v. Hilton\n\nHotel Ret. Plan, No. 98-1517, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28928, at *16-17 (D.D.C. Sept. 27, 2004)\n\n(denying motion to intervene in ERISA suit where plaintiff’s exhaustion “does not excuse\n\nIntervenors own failure to do so,” since movants’ claims differ in nature from plaintiff’s claims).\n\n       In sum, the Court finds that, even if these motions were not moot, the Movants would\n\nhave failed to meet the requirements for intervention of right.\n\n       2.      Permissive Intervention Would Not Be Warranted\n       As an alternative ground, the Movants contend that the Court should exercise its broad\n\ndiscretion for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(2) and grant their motions to intervene.\n\nEven if the motions to intervene were not moot, the Court would decline to allow permissive\n\nintervention. For permissive intervention, the Movants must show that they share with the main\n\naction a common question of law or fact, and the Court “must consider whether the intervention\n\nwill unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.” FED. R. CIV. P.\n\n24(b)(1)(B) & (3). The Movants would satisfy neither of these requisite showings.\n\n                                            Page 91 of 94\n\f       The Movants acknowledge the differences in the factual allegations among each of the\n\nMovants and the plaintiffs, stating that the claims of each “present[] their unique experience.”\n\nMovants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 29, at 2; Movants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 26, at 2.\n\nNonetheless, the Movants contend that these conceded differences militate in favor, not against,\n\nintervention because together each “plaintiff and/or intervenor adds a piece to a complex puzzle”\n\nthat “portray[s] a hostile work environment.” Id. The Court disagrees.\n\n       Close examination of the Movants’ claims make clear that they do not sufficiently share\n\ncommon questions of law or fact in common with each other or the main action that these claims\n\ncould be efficiently considered together. Other courts have similarly denied intervention in\n\ndiscrimination cases for failure to show a common question of law or fact “where they allege\n\ndisparate treatment claims that are unique to each individual complainant.” Jones, 2004 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 17981, at *32 (citing Seils v. Rochester City School District, 199 F.R.D. 506, 512\n\n(W.D.N.Y. 2001) (“The fact that a plaintiff may attempt to introduce evidence relating to the\n\ntreatment of a proposed intervenor at trial in the instant matter does not create ‘common issues of\n\nlaw or fact’ warranting intervention.”)).\n\n       Despite the limited overlap in the factual allegations and legal claims of the Movants and\n\nplaintiffs, the fact remains that each asserts particular individual circumstances. The Movants’\n\nclaims largely relate to different CFSA units, different supervisors, different allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory and retaliatory actions, and different adverse actions than the plaintiffs. For\n\nexample, while all of the plaintiffs complain about their treatment in the CPS component of\n\nCFSA, six of the Movants allege discriminatory treatment by other units, including In-Home and\n\nReunification Services, the Licensing & Monitoring Division and the Family Stabilization\n\nBranch. See Bergman v. Snow, No. 06-303, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109274, at *2-3 (D.D.C.\n\n\n\n                                            Page 92 of 94\n\fJuly 10, 2008) (motion to intervene in disability discrimination suit denied as having “no merit”\n\nwhere movant claimed to “suffer from similar psychiatric disorders” as plaintiff but worked in\n\n“entirely different parts of the Agency”). The three Movants who did work in CPS complain\n\nabout entirely different actions than the plaintiffs. Outlined below are several examples:\n\n           •   Movant Ivey describes her alleged observations of African caseworkers being\n               warned not to submit overtime payments, but this is simply not a central claim\n               made by any plaintiff.\n\n           •   Movant Lahai complains about being completely overwhelmed by her workload\n               in 2008 after the Jacks tragedy, but unlike the plaintiffs who complained that they\n               were penalized with poor work evaluations for their backlogs, Lahai claims she\n               was given nothing to do and then was transferred to another unit.\n\n           •   Movant Mickens-Lewis describes the demand from the CPS Deputy Director,\n               Supervisor I, to terminate an African caseworker due to a complaint from a family\n               he was investigating, but she nowhere alleges that the termination request was due\n               to a discriminatory or retaliatory reason. Unlike the plaintiffs’ claims of\n               retaliation for engaging in protected activity, Mickens-Lewis’ claim that she was\n               terminated for not complying with Supervisor I’s instructions to fire a caseworker\n               who was the subject of a complaint, does not appear to involve any allegation of\n               underlying discrimination against her or retaliation for engaging in protected\n               activity.\n       The differences in each Movant and plaintiff’s experiences would unduly complicate and\n\nconfuse the circumstances that apply to each party. For example, the Movants complain about\n\nSupervisors K through T, wholly different supervisors than A through J, whose actions are the\n\nsource of the plaintiffs’ complaints. In total, at least twenty different supervisors at various\n\nmanagement levels in various CFSA components are alleged to have engaged in discriminatory\n\nor retaliatory actions against different Movants and the plaintiffs. Keeping track of which\n\nsupervisor took an allegedly illegal action against a particular plaintiff or Movant would lead to\n\nunnecessary confusion.\n\n       The differences in the nature of the alleged actions underlying different legal claims\n\nwould also raise a significant risk of engendering potential prejudice not only to the defendant\n\n\n                                            Page 93 of 94\n\fbut also to the claims of the Movants or plaintiffs. For example, certain Movants, such as\n\nMonono and Mbadiugha, claim age discrimination, even though other Movants (e.g., Ivey and\n\nLahai) and plaintiffs (e.g., McCall and Meade), who are older than Monono and Mbadiugha, do\n\nnot assert claims for age discrimination. In addition, certain Movants, such as Ivey, describe\n\nallegedly discriminatory actions taken against other CFSA employees but not against her\n\npersonally, while other Movants claim denial of overtime pay and other allegedly adverse actions\n\ntaken against them. As the defendant accurately points out, “[a]llowing movants to intervene in\n\nthis suit will expand the scope of the issues . . . and delay the current proceeding.” Def. Opp’n to\n\nSecond Mot. at 4.\n\n       Accordingly, even if these motions were not moot, the Court would deny the Movants’\n\nmotions to intervene of right or permissively.\n\nVI.    CONCLUSION\n       For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended\n\nComplaint will be GRANTED, and the plaintiffs’ two pending Motions to Intervene will be\n\nDENIED. This case will be dismissed.\n\n       A separate order consistent with these findings and conclusions of law shall accompany\n\nthis Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\nDATED: April 16, 2012\n                                                             /s/ Beryl A.

As a consequence of CFSA’s alleged discriminatory and retaliatory actions,\n\nplaintiffs claim that they are entitled to damages under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”), 29\n\nU.S.C. § 633a(a), the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”), and 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n1981 and 1983.\n\n       Pending before the Court are (1) the defendant’s motion, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, and (2) two\n\nmotions, pursuant to Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for leave to permit nine\n\nadditional current and former employees of CFSA to intervene as plaintiffs in this action. All\n\ntogether, the plaintiffs’ Complaint and proposed intervenors’ Complaints-in-intervention amount\n\nto over one hundred pages and over one thousand numbered paragraphs. They have alleged such\n\n                                             Page 1 of 94\n\fa plethora of facts that they have made clear their success on the merits is impossible. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, the Court finds that the claims of six plaintiffs are barred by res judicata\n\nor failure to meet the procedural prerequisites for bringing this action, and the claims of the three\n\nremaining plaintiffs fail to state cognizable causes of action. Consequently, the defendant’s\n\nmotion to dismiss is granted and the motions to intervene are denied.\n\nI.         FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n           A.       Procedural History\n\n           Two plaintiffs, Angella Peters 1 and Larry McCall, initiated this lawsuit on October 28,\n\n2009, alleging that the District of Columbia violated their rights under the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, for which they sought damages under 42\n\nU.S.C. §§1981 and 1983. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding\n\nfour plaintiffs — Maria Dyson, Augustine Ekwem, Jacqueline Moore and Katherine Washington\n\n— as well as claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the ADEA, and the\n\nDCHRA. On March 16, 2010, the Court granted the plaintiffs’ unopposed motion for leave to\n\nfile a Second Amended Complaint, 2 which added three more plaintiffs: Joan Simpson, Melva\n\nMeade, and Cynthia Courts-Marshall. 3 See Minute Order (Mar. 16, 2010) (Sullivan, J.). 4\n\n\n\n\n1\n There is discrepancy in the briefing material from the plaintiffs about the spelling of the lead plaintiff’s first name\n(she is sometimes referred to as “Angela” and other times referred to as “Angella”). The Court will refer to Ms.\nPeters as “Angella,” which is how her named is spelled in the Second Amended Complaint.

On July 23,\n\n2010, and again on April 22, 2011, the plaintiffs moved, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 24, to allow a total of nine additional putative plaintiffs to intervene. These motions\n\nto intervene are opposed by the defendant and have been denied by Order entered on March 30,\n\n2012. This Memorandum Opinion sets forth the reasons for that Order.\n\n       B.      Allegations in Second Amended Complaint\n\n       The nine plaintiffs named in the Second Amended Complaint are black women and men\n\nwho have worked as caseworkers and supervisors at the CFSA for varying lengths of time,\n\nranging from three to eighteen years. Four of the plaintiffs are current or former caseworkers\n\nand the other five plaintiffs are current or former supervisors. The four caseworker plaintiffs\n\n(Angella Peters, Larry McCall, Maria Dyson and Katherine Washington) complain primarily\n\nabout the allegedly abusive and discriminatory conduct directed at them by a single supervisor.\n\nThree of these caseworker plaintiffs apparently remain employed at CFSA: both Maria Dyson\n\nand Katherine Washington remain caseworkers in Child Protective Services (“CPS”), a\n\ncomponent of CFSA, and Larry McCall’s current assignment is not identified. The five\n\nmanagement plaintiffs (Cynthia Courts-Marshall, Jacqueline Moore, Joan Simpson, Augustine\n\nEkwem and Melva Meade), complain about the conduct of at least eight other managers at\n\nCFSA, including the CFSA Deputy Director of Operations, for allegedly creating a hostile work\n\nenvironment, and discriminatory and retaliatory conduct. Two of the management plaintiffs\n\n(Augustine Ekwem and Melva Meade) remain employed at CFSA, while the other three\n\nmanagement plaintiffs (Cynthia Courts-Marshall, Jacqueline Moore and Joan Simpson) are no\n\nlonger employed at CFSA.\n\n\n\n\n                                           Page 3 of 94\n\f           The Second Amended Complaint asserts two core allegations against CFSA: first,\n\n“[f]rom as early as 2001, the Child and Family Services Agency had a custom of allowing its\n\nsupervisors to bully older, black social workers, particularly those from Africa or the Caribbean\n\nIslands,” and this conduct created a hostile work environment that management condoned.\n\nCompl. at 2. Second, CFSA, from as early as 2003, “had a custom of allowing its supervisors to\n\nretaliate against social workers who complain about discriminatory practices.” Id. The alleged\n\nretaliatory actions against the plaintiffs took different forms, ranging from re-assignment of\n\nduties to demotion in position to the unfair assignment of an overwhelming caseload.\n\nSpecifically, the four caseworker plaintiffs complain that, following the tragic discovery, in\n\nJanuary 2008, of the deaths of Banita Jacks’ four young daughters in a Washington, D.C. row\n\nhouse, there was a “surge in [the number of] child abuse and neglect reports.” Id. ¶¶ 75-89\n\n(Peters), ¶¶ 125-33 (McCall), ¶¶ 166-93 (Dyson), ¶¶ 213-28 (Washington). While\n\nacknowledging this across-the-board increase in workload, the caseworker plaintiffs complain\n\nthat they were assigned an unfair number of cases, which resulted in backlogs and prompted\n\nadverse employment actions, ranging from being “written up” to reprimands. Id. Two\n\nsupervisor plaintiffs also allege retaliation: Jacqueline Moore alleges that after she complained to\n\nhuman resources about her treatment by a supervisor, she was retaliated against, id. ¶¶ 267-310,\n\nand Cynthia Courts-Marshall alleges that she was retaliated against after she refused to fire\n\nemployees as instructed by her supervisor, id. ¶¶ 605-10, 617-18. The allegedly retaliatory\n\nactions against these two supervisors included poor job performance evaluations, which resulted\n\nin a denial of pay increases, id. ¶¶ 272-81, 293 (Moore); demotion to a caseworker position to\n\nhelp with the post-Jacks tragedy surge in cases, id. ¶¶ 284-86 (Moore); and re-assignment or\n\nremoval of duties, id. ¶¶ 308-10 (Moore), id. ¶¶ 630-35 (Courts-Marshall). 5\n5\n    The three remaining supervisors (Simpson, Meade and Ekwem) do not assert retaliation claims.\n\n                                                    Page 4 of 94\n\f          All nine plaintiffs claim that they were discriminated against on the basis of race and\n\nsubjected or exposed to a hostile work environment during at least some portion of their\n\nemployment at CFSA between 2001 and 2009. 6 Four plaintiffs (Ekwem, Moore, Peters and\n\nSimpson) also claim discrimination on the basis of national origin. Six plaintiffs (Dyson,\n\nEkwem, McCall, Moore, Peters and Washington) claim age discrimination, even though the\n\nthree plaintiffs who do not make this claim are also over 40 years of age and two of them are\n\nolder than some of the plaintiffs who do claim age discrimination. Finally, six plaintiffs (Courts-\n\nMarshall, Dyson, McCall, Moore, Peters and Washington) claim retaliation. 7\n\n          The Title VII and ADEA discrimination claims asserted by each plaintiff are summarized\n\nin the chart below.\n\n\n    Plaintiff –       Discrimination based upon:                             Hostile Work         Retaliation\n    Position           Race      National                                    Environment\n                      (Black)    Origin       Age            Gender\n    Peters –          √       √ (Jamaican) √                NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                              (51)\n    McCall –          √         NO                 NO       NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                                     (57)\n    Washington-       √         NO                 √        NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                                     (52)\n    Dyson –           √         NO                 √        NO               √                    √\n    Caseworker                                     (49)\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Based upon statements contained in the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend, the defendant construed the claims\nasserted in the Second Amended Complaint by the three new plaintiffs (Simpson, Meade and Courts-Marshall) to be\nlimited to claims ‘“under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution due to the\ndeprivation of equal protection rights; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.’ (Pl.’s Mot. Amend, p.2.).” Def.’s\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Mem”), ECF No. 21, at 9. The Court disagrees with the defendant’s\nview.

The plausibility standard for pleading demands more\n\nthan that the factual allegations present a “sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully,” and requires a “common sense,” “context-specific” examination of the pleadings to\n\n“determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at\n\n1949; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567-70 (antitrust complaint dismissed because allegations\n\nof parallel conduct, even accepted as true, were consistent with an unlawful agreement but also\n\ncompatible with, and indeed more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market\n\nbehavior and, therefore, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement). “Where a complaint\n\npleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line\n\nbetween possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, to “enter the realm of plausible liability,” the\n\nfactual allegations must be more than merely “neutral” or “suggestive,” and plaintiffs must\n\n“[nudge] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557\n\nn.5, 570.\n\n       Consequently, when evaluating whether a complaint sufficiently sets forth a plausible\n\nclaim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must apply a two-pronged approach, which, first,\n\n“identif[ies] pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the\n\nassumption of truth.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950. Second, the court must examine the factual\n\nallegations and, assuming their veracity, “then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an\n\nentitlement to relief.” Id. Absent factual matter permitting the court “to infer ‘more than the\n\n\n\n\n                                             Page 15 of 94\n\fmere possibility of misconduct,’” the complaint must be dismissed. Jones, 634 F.3d at 596\n\n(quoting Atherton, 567 F.3d at 681-82). 18\n\n         Viewing the claims in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as it must at this stage of the\n\nproceedings, the Court proceeds with a discussion of the plaintiffs’ claims as follows. The Court\n\nfirst addresses, in section III, Plaintiff Ekwem’s claims, which the Court concludes are barred by\n\nthe doctrine of res judicata. The Court then turns, in section IV, to the defendant’s Motion to\n\nDismiss for the claims of the remaining eight plaintiffs. The Court addresses (A) the dismissal\n\nof the Title VII and ADEA claims of five of the plaintiffs for failure to exhaust their\n\nadministrative remedies. The Court then analyzes the claims of the remaining plaintiffs, Peters,\n\nMcCall, and Moore, addressing (B) their hostile work environment claims, (C) their disparate\n\ntreatment claims, and (D) their retaliation claims. The Court then reviews the plaintiffs’ (E)\n\nconstitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and (F) District of Columbia\n\nHuman Rights claims. Finally, the Court considers, in section V, the plaintiffs-intervenors’\n\nMotions to Intervene. Since the Court concludes that all of the plaintiffs’ claims are subject to\n\ndismissal, and denies the plaintiffs-intervenors’ motions to intervene, the case must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n18\n   In support of a more lenient standard governing motions under Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs cite Conley v.

J. 1 (2010)\n(cited in Jones, 634 F.3d at 596 n.4). Even if the Court were not precluded by Supreme Court precedent in Iqbal\nand Twombly from adopting a more lenient standard, the plaintiffs’ claims would still be dismissed. This is not a\nsituation where the Court is dismissing a case because plaintiffs have not been sufficiently specific in their\nComplaint. In this case, the plaintiffs have pled their claims in such detail that it is possible for the Court to\ndetermine that the plaintiffs cannot possibly prevail on their claims. There is thus no reason to allow the plaintiffs to\nproceed beyond this stage of the proceedings, as no amount of elaboration of the plaintiffs’ claims would allow the\nplaintiffs to prevail on the merits of their claims. As the Supreme Court cautioned in Twombly, “when the\nallegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should\nbe exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.” 550 U.S. at 558\n(internal citation, quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).\n\n\n                                                    Page 16 of 94\n\fIII.   The Claims of Plaintiff Ekwem Are Barred by Res Judicata\n\n       The Court first turns to Plaintiff Ekwem’s claims. The defendant contends that the\n\nclaims asserted by Plaintiff Augustine Ekwem should be dismissed because he is barred from\n\nasserting them under the doctrine of res judicata. Indeed, Ekwem concedes that he was an\n\nindividual plaintiff in a separate lawsuit previously filed in this Court arising out of his\n\nemployment at CFSA. Pls.’ Mem. at 26.

There is no question here that the third and fourth prongs have been met since\n\nEkwem’s prior lawsuit was dismissed in a final judgment on the merits by another judge from\n\nthis Court. Thus, only the first and second factors for application of the res judicata doctrine\n\nneed be addressed.\n\n               B.      Analysis\n\n       In his dismissed complaint, Ekwem claimed, inter alia, that the defendants — the Mayor\n\nof the District of Columbia and CFSA — allegedly discriminated against him in violation of his\n\nright to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment, and conspired to deprive him of those\n\nrights in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988. Ekwem concedes that both of his\n\nlawsuits “allege employment discrimination at the [CFSA],” but argues that the first prong\n\nrequired for application of res judicata is not met. Pls.’ Mem. at 26. Specifically, he contends\n\nthat his current Complaint differs from the dismissed claims in two ways: first, the instant\n\nComplaint focuses on “a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, § 1981, ADEA, and\n\nDCHRA;” and, second, the instant Complaint asserts different facts regarding the “constructive\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 18 of 94\n\fterminations” of co-workers in November 2009 that were not in existence at the time of his prior\n\nlawsuit. Id.\n\n       The fact that the causes of action here are not identical to the causes of action in the prior\n\nsuit, however, does not overcome application of the res judicata doctrine to bar Ekwen’s claims.\n\n“Whether two cases implicate the same cause of action turns on whether they share the same\n\n‘nucleus of facts.’” Apotex, Inc. v.

Cir. 1984). The factual\n\nallegations underpinning Ekwem’s current claims mirror those in the dismissed action. In the\n\ndismissed action, for example, Ekwem alleged that he was unfairly assigned an overwhelming\n\nnumber of cases to supervise in 2008 and that he was improperly disciplined after the death of a\n\nchild whose case had been assigned to a caseworker under Ekwen’s supervision. Ekwem, 666 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 74-75. He asserts the same allegations in the instant complaint, namely, that his\n\nworkload increased significantly in 2008 and that by June of 2008, he had been assigned more\n\ncaseworkers than any other supervisor. Compl. ¶¶ 446, 452. The instant Complaint also avers\n\nthat a caseworker under Ekwem’s supervision was assigned a child abuse and neglect case\n\n“which concluded on June 25, 2008 with the death of a six month old boy.” Id. ¶ 457.\n\nAccording to the Second Amended Complaint, the caseworker was terminated and, on July 9,\n\n2008, Ekwem was placed on administrative leave. Id. ¶¶ 462-63. Based on this conduct, he\n\nalleges that the CFSA discriminated against him on the basis of his “race (black), national origin\n\n(Nigerian), age (52), and gender (male).” Id. ¶ 426.\n\n       Under res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or\n\ntheir privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action. In this\n\naction, Ekwem reasserts claims of discrimination that have been previously decided on the\n\n\n\n                                            Page 19 of 94\n\fmerits, and a new claim of “hostile work environment” that arises from the same factual basis\n\nand thus could have been brought in his prior lawsuit. Despite the differences in legal theories,\n\nboth actions advanced by Ekwem relate largely to the same time period and turn on allegations\n\nthat Ekwem was unfairly assigned too many cases and too many caseworkers to supervise, which\n\nresulted in him being improperly suspended. The claims he asserts here could have been brought\n\nin that action and, having skipped that opportunity, he is not allowed to assert them here. 19\n\n         Finally, as to the last factor, the parties in the dismissed lawsuit are the same parties in\n\nthis litigation. In the prior action, Ekwem named Adrian Fenty, in his official capacity as Mayor\n\nof the District of Columbia, and the CFSA as defendants. See Ekwem, 666 F. Supp. 2d at 74.\n\nThe real party in interest for the Mayor and CFSA in the dismissed lawsuit was the District,\n\nwhich is the same defendant as in the instant action. See Sheppard, 791 F.

DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS OF THE\n         REMAINING EIGHT PLAINTIFFS\n\n         The defendant has moved, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, to dismiss the claims of the remaining eight plaintiffs on grounds that: first, the\n\nplaintiffs’ statutory claims under Title VII and the ADEA are barred for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies; and second, the allegations of discrimination underlying the plaintiffs’\n\nTitle VII, ADEA, 42 U.S.C. §§1981 and 1983, and DCHRA claims are insufficient either under\n\nthe McDonnell-Douglas framework or to demonstrate the requisite custom or policy of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia to establish municipal liability. These arguments are addressed seriatim\n\nbelow, assuming the truth of the plaintiffs’ allegations as the Court must do at the 12(b)(6) stage\n\nof proceedings.\n\n         A.       Dismissal of Title VII and ADEA Claims of Five Plaintiffs For Failure to\n                  Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n\n         The defendant argues for dismissal of the Title VII and ADEA claims in the Second\n\nAmended Complaint, except the claims asserted by Peters, as untimely due to the failure to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies. Def.’s Mem. at 11. At the time of filing the Second Amended\n\nComplaint only Peters had received a Right-to-Sue letter from the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”), even though both McCall and Moore had also filed EEOC\n\ncomplaints. Compl. ¶¶ 2-4. Both McCall and Moore subsequently received their right-to-sue\n\nletters on March 19 and August 26, 2010, respectively. Pls.’ Mem. at 11, 28; Pls.’ EEOC Docs,\n\nECF No. 30-2. 20\n\n\n20\n   In order to insure the completeness of the record regarding the status of the plaintiffs’ EEOC filings, the Court\ndirected the plaintiffs to submit “copies of any charge filed by a plaintiff or applicant for intervention with the\nEEOC that is related to the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint [and] . . . . any resulting right-to-sue letter\nissued by the EEOC.” Minute Order (Dec. 19, 2011). In response, the plaintiffs submitted the EEOC charges filed\n\n                                                   Page 21 of 94\n\f         The defendant does not address the impact of receipt by McCall and Moore of their\n\nEEOC right-to-sue letters after the filing of this lawsuit. Instead, the defendant analyzes the\n\nclaims of these two plaintiffs as part of the group of plaintiffs who filed no complaint with the\n\nEEOC (“non-filing plaintiffs”), and argues that the Title VII and ADEA claims of all eight of\n\nthese plaintiffs should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies before filing\n\nsuit. The plaintiffs contend that any non-filing plaintiff may rely on “vicarious exhaustion” to\n\nassert his or her discrimination claims here. The defendant counters that “the diverse and varied\n\nnature” of the plaintiffs’ claims precludes the availability of vicarious exhaustion to excuse the\n\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies. Def.’s Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss\n\n(“Def.’s Reply”), ECF No. 23, at 1. The Court agrees in part and disagrees in part. Specifically,\n\nas explained below, while the Court finds that McCall and Moore have timely exhausted their\n\nadministrative remedies, the non-filing plaintiffs may not “piggy-back” on the administrative\n\nexhaustion by three of the plaintiffs.\n\n\nby Plaintiffs Peters, Moore and McCall, as well as copies of the right-to-sue letters issued by the EEOC to each of\nthese plaintiffs. Pls.’ EEOC Docs, ECF No. 30. The plaintiffs indicated that three unidentified proposed intervenors\nhad filed EEOC complaints and one (Fedelia Phillips) had received a right-to-sue letter. Id. at 1.

For this reason, in cases where the single-filing doctrine has been invoked, courts have\n\nexamined the original EEOC filing of the party with the perfected EEOC charge to evaluate\n\n\n\n                                             Page 27 of 94\n\fwhether it provided sufficient notice of all charges by the plaintiffs who claim to be similarly\n\nsituated and seek to “piggy-back” on that charge. Recent cases from this jurisdiction are\n\ninstructive in evaluating the similarity of claims for employment discrimination and retaliation to\n\nsupport application of the single-filing exception. For example, in Brooks v. Dist. Hosp.\n\nPartners, L.P., the D.C. Circuit found that the district court had improperly dismissed claims\n\nasserted by external applicants for nursing assistant positions for lack of administrative\n\nexhaustion. 606 F.3d at 807. The court concluded those external applicants could “piggy back”\n\non the perfected EEOC charge filed by an internal applicant since examination of that EEOC\n\ncharge showed that it raised the same race discrimination claim as the external applicants, was\n\nasserted on behalf of others similarly situated, and the EEOC’s investigation reviewed data\n\nrelated to both internal and external applicants to find a disparate impact on black candidates\n\nfrom the employer’s use of a new three-part screening test. Id. Thus, the court held that an\n\nindependent EEOC filing by the external applicants “would have been redundant: [the employer]\n\nalready had received adequate notice of appellants’ exact allegation and the EEOC had first\n\ncrack at resolving that allegation.” Id. In such circumstances, where multiple plaintiffs’ claims\n\narose from the same allegedly discriminatory practice presented to and analyzed by the EEOC,\n\nthe court found that the plaintiffs had “properly invoked the single-filing exception to join the\n\nlawsuit . . . .” Id. 22\n\n\n22\n  Courts in other jurisdictions have apparently limited application of the single-filing exception to circumstances\nwhere the party with the perfected administrative charge had noted the collective or class-wide nature of the claim in\nthe EEOC charge of discrimination.

Chief\n\nJudge Lamberth reviewed the original EEOC charge and a supporting internal report submitted\n\nto the EEOC to determine whether a plaintiff, who never filed an EEOC complaint before joining\n\nthe lawsuit, was permitted to “piggy-back” on her co-plaintiffs’ perfected administrative\n\ncomplaints. Id. at 63. Despite certain similarities of legal claims and “overlapping” facts\n\nbetween the EEOC charge and the factual allegations asserted by the plaintiff, Chief Judge\n\nLamberth concluded that the plaintiff’s complaint would require “a different factual inquiry and\n\ntestimony from different witnesses,” and therefore would not put the defendant on notice of the\n\nextent of the plaintiff’s allegations or potential hostile work environment and retaliation claims.\n\nId. at 64. As a consequence, the court dismissed that plaintiff’s Title VII claims for failure to\n\ncomply with the administrative requirements. Id.\n\n        The Court finds that the legal and factual issues at stake in the instant matter are more\n\nakin to those in Byrd, where the court determined vicarious exhaustion was unavailable, than in\n\nBrooks. The Second Amended Complaint summarily mentions that Peters, McCall and Moore\n\nfiled charges with the EEOC, without any description of the precise factual allegations presented\n\nto that agency. No party to the instant action provided the Court with a copy or details regarding\n\nthe contents of these perfected EEOC charges in order to assess the sufficiency of notice about\n\nthe discrimination allegations, until the Court so directed. In its briefing, the defendant relies\n\nsolely on a comparison of factual allegations and legal claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint to show that they are so “diverse and varied” and “wide-ranging”\n\nfiled untimely charges, are permitted to piggyback on a timely-filed charge that gives the EEOC and the employer\nfair notice of allegations of class-wide discrimination.”).\n\n\n                                                  Page 29 of 94\n\fthat “separate administrative adjudication was not only possible, but necessary.” Def.’s Reply at\n\n3. In the defendant’s view, the five non-filing plaintiffs (Dyson, Washington, Simpson, Meade\n\nand Courts-Marshall) 23 may not piggyback on the administratively exhausted claims because\n\nthese plaintiffs allege different bases for discrimination and different kinds of mistreatment by\n\ndifferent supervisors. Def.’s Mem. at 11-12; Def.’s Reply at 3-4. The Court agrees.\n\n         The legal claims of the five non-filing plaintiffs are not identical to those asserted by\n\nMcCall, Moore, and Peters in the Second Amended Complaint or in their perfected EEOC\n\ncharges. In the Second Amended Complaint, the three filing plaintiffs each assert claims of race\n\ndiscrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation, and both Moore and Peters also assert\n\nclaims of age and non-American born national origin discrimination, all of which were stated in\n\ntheir respective EEOC charges. While each of the non-filing plaintiffs assert legal claims of race\n\ndiscrimination and hostile work environment within CPS during all or part of the same time\n\nperiod from 2005 to 2009, only one (Simpson) claims national origin discrimination, two\n\n(Washington and Dyson) claim age discrimination and four (claim retaliation). Thus, the non-\n\nfiling plaintiffs provide different combinations of protected status for their discrimination claims\n\nthan those included in the perfected EEOC charges of Peters, McCall, and Moore.\n\n         The differences in their legal claims undercut each other. Peters and Moore’s EEOC\n\ncharges assert age and national origin discrimination based upon the alleged assignment of more\n\nwork and the alleged harsher scrutiny given to older, non-American born black caseworkers and\n\nsupervisors. More precisely, Peters states in her EEOC charge that black caseworkers and\n\nsupervisors, who are “age 40 and over, and non-American born are systematically assigned more\n\nwork and subjected to harsher scrutiny than others who are not in these categories.” Pls.’ EEOC\n\n\n23\n  The claims of Plaintiff Ekwem are barred by the doctrine of res judicata, see supra, and therefore are not\ndiscussed in this section of the opinion.\n\n                                                   Page 30 of 94\n\fDocs., No. 30-1, at 1. Moore indicates in her EEOC charge that she has “been subjected to\n\ndifferential treatment as compared to my non-Trinidadian co-workers,” including that after a\n\nleave, she “discover[ed] that a younger, Black American had been hired to fill [her] position.”\n\nPls. EEOC Docs., ECF No. 30-3, at 1. Yet, despite their EEOC charges of age discrimination,\n\nwhich are repeated in the Second Amended Complaint, three of the non-filing plaintiffs (Meade,\n\nSimpson, and Courts-Marshall) are 40 or older but do not allege any age discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, despite the EEOC charges by Peters and Moore of national origin discrimination\n\nagainst non-American born black employees, McCall and four of the non-filing plaintiffs\n\n(Dyson, Washington, Meade, Courts-Marshall) do not fit into the category of “non-American\n\nborn” and still claim that they, too, were discriminated against because they were black. 24\n\n        The differences in the factual allegations pertaining to each plaintiff’s claims also\n\nundercut each other. For example, notably, Moore was one of four supervisors detailed to CPS\n\nto assist with the surge in cases after the Jacks tragedy, and despite her “humiliat[ion] by her\n\ndemotion to hotline caseworker,” she “received compliments on her work and a very good job\n\nperformance evaluation,” after which she was “officially reinstated to the position of supervisor\n\nand given a staff.” Compl. ¶¶ 285-92. Moore’s positive experience is difficult to square with the\n\nallegations of race, age and national origin discrimination directed at CPS caseworkers alleged\n\nby her co-plaintiffs. The Second Amended Complaint further undermines this core racial and\n\nnational origin discrimination claim with inconsistent allegations that employees who were not\n\nblack also suffered discriminatory actions. See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 176-88 (Dyson) (Indian co-worker\n\nalso assigned more cases than “white,” “younger” co-workers); id. ¶ 37 (Peters) (Supervisor A\n\n\n\n24\n  While Moore’s EEOC charge identifies the younger employee who assumed Moore’s position as “Black\nAmerican,” the Second Amended Complaint identifies that employee as “newly hired,” “younger” and “native\nborn,” omitting the fact that the employee was also black. Compl. ¶ 308.\n\n                                               Page 31 of 94\n\f“bullied” white caseworkers). As the defendant observes, “the individual plaintiffs’ allegations\n\nare so varied that they even contradict themselves.” Def.’s Reply Mem. at 3.\n\n       Although the non-filing plaintiffs’ legal claims overlap with those of the perfected EEOC\n\ncharges, this is not enough to excuse the bypassing of the administrative process for these five\n\nplaintiffs when the underlying factual allegations for each of their claims differ significantly.\n\nThe single-filing doctrine is limited to cases in which the legal claims are identical and arise\n\nfrom the same facts, not merely from overlapping or similar facts that may be linked to each\n\nother because the facts involve employees of the same agency. Indeed, just because the plaintiffs\n\nclaim to have suffered a violation of one or more of the same provisions of law as contained in\n\nthe perfected EEOC charges does not mean that their claims depend upon a shared set of facts or\n\na common injury that would have provided notice of the individual claims. Unlike Brooks,\n\nwhere not only the legal claims were identical but also the factual allegations supporting those\n\nclaims stemmed from the employer’s use of the same challenged hiring practice, Peters, McCall\n\nand Moore’s perfected administrative charges each allege distinct factual events that not only\n\ndiffer among themselves but also from those of the five non-filing plaintiffs.\n\n       Among the myriad ways in which the allegations asserted by the non-filing plaintiffs in\n\nthe Second Amended Complaint differ from the facts set forth in the EEOC charges filed by\n\nMcCall, Moore and Peters are that different management personnel were responsible for the\n\ndiscriminatory conduct at issue. The EEOC charges of both Peters and McCall cite allegedly\n\nunfair conduct only by Supervisor A and Moore cites such conduct only by Supervisor F. In the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint, Moore also describes allegedly abusive conduct by Supervisors D\n\nand G. The non-filing plaintiffs complain about entirely different supervisors. Non-filing\n\nplaintiffs Dyson, Simpson, Meade and Courts-Marshall complain about conduct by Supervisors\n\n\n\n                                            Page 32 of 94\n\fB, E, H and I, who are nowhere complained about by Peters, McCall or Moore either in the\n\nComplaint or in the perfected EEOC charges.\n\n       In addition, the alleged misconduct engaged in by Supervisors A through I towards the\n\nnon-filing plaintiffs varies significantly from the specific conduct alleged in the perfected EEOC\n\ncharges. McCall’s EEOC charge refers to a single instance of Supervisor A giving him a critical\n\nwritten performance warning in July, 2009, while Peters’ EEOC charge states that the same\n\nSupervisor A “singled [her] out” and “on at least four occasions” made formal write-ups about\n\nPeters’ performance, even though similarly situated employees, who were younger and white,\n\nwere not written-up. Pls.’ EEOC Docs., at ECF Nos. 30-1, 30-2. In the Second Amended\n\nComplaint, Peters provides additional detail that Supervisor A made abusive and demeaning\n\ncomments and engaged in bullying conduct directed at her. The other three CPS caseworkers\n\n(McCall, Dyson and Washington) allegedly witnessed aspects of Supervisor A’s mistreatment of\n\nPeters, but nowhere allege that this abusive conduct was directed at them. Indeed, even though\n\nDyson was supervised by Supervisor A, she claims that a different supervisor, Supervisor E,\n\nimposed performance penalties on her due to her backlog of cases following the Jacks tragedy.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 190-92.\n\n       As noted above, in her EEOC charge, Moore cites her black Supervisor F for excluding\n\nMoore from meetings and assigning her “a greater work load and . . . menial task[s].” Pls.’\n\nEEOC Docs., ECF No. 30-3.\n\n       By contrast to the conduct of Supervisors A and F cited in the perfected EEOC charges,\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory conduct engaged in by the other supervisors set forth in the Second\n\nAmended Complaint covers a broad range of activity. For example, certain supervisors are\n\naccused of ineffectually addressing employee complaints about Supervisor A’s conduct\n\n\n\n                                           Page 33 of 94\n\f(Supervisors B, C, D), refusing to write a recommendation (Supervisor B), or directing a\n\nsubordinate to terminate employees purportedly for retaliatory reasons (Supervisor I). These\n\ndifferences are significant. Confronted with the charges of the three filing plaintiffs, the EEOC\n\nwould not have been alerted to the scope of the allegations asserted now by the non-filing\n\nplaintiffs against a far greater number of supervisors in the Second Amended Complaint.\n\n       Finally, the claimed adverse employment consequences of the defendant’s allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory conduct varies between the filing and the non-filing plaintiffs. For example, both\n\nPeters and Moore claim that their resignations were constructive discharges, and McCall claims\n\nthat his job transfer was a constructive transfer. See Peters EEOC Charge, ECF No. 30-1 (“I\n\nresigned because the conditions were unbearable.”); Moore EEOC Charge, ECF No. 30-3 (“I am\n\non leave pending my retirement. . . .”); McCall EEOC Charge, ECF No. 30-2 (“I transferred out\n\nof the Ms. Jessen’s unit” and, according to the Compl. ¶ 138, out of the CPS). By contrast, the\n\nnon-filing plaintiffs claim injuries ranging from poor performance write-ups and transfers within\n\nCPS to termination. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 194 (Dyson transferred to another unit within CPS); ¶\n\n233 (Washington written-up); ¶ 394 (Simpson terminated); ¶ 561 (Meade feared retaliation but\n\nalleges no adverse employment action); ¶ 641 (Courts-Marshall terminated).\n\n       In sum, the allegations of the non-filing plaintiffs are not “so similar” that “no\n\nconciliatory purpose would be served by filing separate EEOC charges. . . .” Foster, 655 F.2d at\n\n1322. Consequently, the administrative complaints filed by McCall, Moore and Peters would not\n\nsuffice to provide notice to the EEOC or the possibility of the disposition of claims by the non-\n\nfiling plaintiffs, who seek to “piggy-back” on their co-plaintiffs’ perfected EEOC charges.\n\nTherefore, the doctrine of “vicarious exhaustion” does not apply and each plaintiff is required to\n\nexhaust his or her individual administrative remedies. Only Peters, Moore and McCall satisfy\n\n\n\n                                           Page 34 of 94\n\fthe exhaustion requirement. Accordingly, the Title VII claims of the non-filing plaintiffs Dyson,\n\nWashington, Meade, Simpson, and Courts-Marshall, as well as the ADEA claims 25 of plaintiffs\n\nDyson and Washington, will be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n           B.       Hostile Work Environment Claims of Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore\n\n                Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore contend that they have “actionable hostile work\n\nenvironment claims based on race, age and/or national origin discrimination.” Pls.’ Mem. at 11.\n\nViewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the Second Amended\n\nComplaint alleges, generally, that CFSA “[m]anagement condoned a hostile work environment\n\nand took no measures to prevent it.” Compl. at 2. In particular, both Peters and McCall allege in\n\nsupport of their claims, that they “worked in a racially hostile work environment, from 2005 to\n\n2009, where [older], black caseworkers, particularly those from Africa and the Caribbean\n\nIslands, were bullied by their supervisors.” Id. ¶¶ 22, 97. Moore alleges that she, too, “worked\n\nin a hostile work environment, from 2001 to the present, where she was bullied by her\n\nsupervisors.” Id. ¶ 237. The defendant contends that these plaintiffs have failed to establish a\n\nprima facie claim of a hostile work environment since, even if they were mistreated by their\n\nsupervisors, they cannot show it was because of their protected status. 26 Def.’s Mem. at 15-16.\n\nThe Court agrees that these plaintiffs have failed to plead a prima facie case of hostile work\n\nenvironment.\n\n25\n     Plaintiffs Meade, Simpson and Courts-Marshall did not assert age discrimination claims under the ADEA.\n26\n  The defendant summarily asserts without analysis that “many of the allegations” underlying the plaintiffs’ Title\nVII claims are time-barred, stating that Title VII claims require the filing of “a charge of discrimination with the\n[EEOC] either 180 days or 300 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-\n5(e)(1).” Def.’s Mem. at 22-23.

Analysis\n\n            In this case, there is no dispute that plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore, who each are\n\nblack and over 40 years of age, are members of a protected class and that they each allege that\n\nthey personally felt the CFSA-CPS environment was hostile. Indeed, as to Peters and McCall at\n\nleast, the defendant concedes that, “[i]f taken as true, these allegations may establish that\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 38 of 94\n\f[Supervisor A] was rude and intimidating . . . .” Def.’s Mem. at 14. Thus, the Court finds that\n\nthe first two elements of a hostile work environment claim are met.\n\n        Nevertheless, the defendant contends that the plaintiffs fail to show that any alleged\n\nmistreatment was because of their membership in a protected class. Id. at 14-18. In determining\n\nwhether a hostile work environment exists, the court must look at the “totality of the\n\ncircumstances,” including whether the comments or actions at issue “expressly focused” on the\n\nplaintiff’s protected class.

According to the defendant, “no plaintiff in this action\n\nalleges facts showing that he or she was the direct target of a single discriminatory remark or\n\naction, much less a working environment heavily polluted with discrimination.” Def.’s. Reply at\n\n5 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the plaintiffs acknowledge that “the\n\nharassment, with a few exceptions, was primarily harsh treatment as opposed to racial or ethnic\n\ncomments.” Pls.’ Mem. at 16. Moreover, the defendant argues that merely witnessing abusive\n\nconduct, when the conduct at issue does not contain “any sort of racial, ethnic or age-related\n\novertones,” Def.’s Reply at 4, is not enough to establish a valid claim for hostile work\n\nenvironment. The hostile work environment claims of plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore are\n\naddressed individually below.\n\n               a.      Plaintiff Peters\n\n       Peters provides the most detail about patently unpleasant conduct by Supervisor A that\n\nwas directed at Peters and that she claims contributed to the hostile work environment at CFSA-\n\nCPS. Supervisor A allegedly over a period of about four years, “harassed” Peters, treated her\n\n“like a ‘whipping boy,’” “screamed at, talked down to, and pointed her finger [and] . . . yelled at\n\nMs. Peters,” “made intimidating comments” about getting her fired or threatening to “write [her]\n\n\n\n                                           Page 39 of 94\n\fup,” physically blocked Peters on several occasions from leaving her cubicle with the placement\n\nof a chair and instructed her to get back to work when Peters was in the bathroom, and\n\ninterrupted Peters’ conversations to stop others from talking to her. Compl. ¶¶ 36-73. Indeed,\n\nPeters is identified as the employee who was “the principal target of [Supervisor A’s] abuse.”\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 48, 223; see also id. ¶ 108 (“Ms. Peters received the worst treatment.”); id. ¶ 158\n\n(“Ms. Peters received the most degrading treatment of anyone.”); id. ¶ 354 (“[Supervisor A]\n\nsingled Ms. Peters out for harsh treatment.”). The defendant argues that these actions directed at\n\nPeters do not contain discriminatory content and therefore “fail to show that [Supervisor A]\n\nmistreated Ms. Peters because of her protected status.” Def.’s Mem. at 15 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). Indeed, even rude office conduct that generates stressful working conditions does not\n\ncreate liability for discrimination under Title VII, unless that conduct is “permeated with\n\ndiscriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.” Harris, 510 U.S. at 21 (internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n       In an effort to satisfy the requirement of showing an environment hostile to persons due\n\nto their race, national origin or age — as opposed to generally unpleasant for all the employees\n\nand particularly unpleasant for Peters — the plaintiffs allege that “older, black caseworkers,\n\nparticularly those from Africa and the Caribbean Islands, were bullied by their supervisors\n\n[while] [s]imilarly situated caseworkers, who were younger or not black, were not bullied by\n\ntheir supervisors.” Compl. ¶¶ 22-23, 97-98, 145-46. Yet, this assertion is undermined by the\n\nallegations that (1) white caseworkers managed by Supervisor A “were bullied like their black\n\ncounterparts,” id. ¶ 37; (2) Supervisor A “complain[ed] about other caseworkers,” id. ¶ 50,\n\napparently without distinction as to their protected status; (3) Supervisor A “did not make\n\n[intimidating ] comments to . . . Ms. Peters’ African American co-workers,” id. ¶ 55; and (4)\n\n\n\n                                           Page 40 of 94\n\fSupervisor A’s unit, which the complaint alleges includes both white and black caseworkers,\n\ncomplained about this supervisor’s “abusive behavior” and accused her of race discrimination,\n\nid. ¶¶ 37, 68-69; 119. As the defendant states, “plaintiffs’ allegations clearly indicate that\n\n[Supervisor A] mistreated everyone, regardless of their race.” Def.’s Mem. at 15.\n\n       Not only do the internally inconsistent factual allegations in the Complaint defeat the\n\nthird requisite element of showing that Peters was subjected to abuse because of her protected\n\nstatus, but she has failed to establish the fourth requisite element for a hostile work environment\n\nclaim. Specifically, during the several years that Peters worked for Supervisor A from 2005 until\n\nearly 2008, there is no allegation that she was penalized by any material adverse change in the\n\nterms or conditions of her employment. Over the course of those four years, she does not allege\n\nthat she was given any “write-up,” any reprimand, any suspension, or any forced transfer. In\n\nfact, the only adverse personnel actions cited by Peters — warnings and a reprimand allegedly\n\nculminating in her alleged constructive discharge in October, 2009 — occurred after the 2008\n\nJacks tragedy and are part of the factual allegations underlying Peters’ claim of retaliation.

Peters’ claims about her\n\ntreatment following the Jacks tragedy generally boil down to the allegation that she was assigned\n\nan overwhelming number of cases, which created a backlog for which she was penalized by\n\nbeing “written up” multiple times, when “other members of [Supervisor A’s] unit” with similar\n\nbacklogs “were not written up.” Compl. ¶ 85. She alleges more specifically that “by March 31,\n\n2008” she “had 41 cases to investigate with a backlog of 31 cases,” and was being written up for\n\nthe backlog the following month. Id. ¶¶ 79, 83. She had more of a backlog than McCall and\n\nDyson but less of a backlog than Washington, but they too were written up. Id. ¶¶ 127, 131 (as\n\nof March 31, 2008, McCall had 36 cases to investigate with a backlog of 28 cases); id. ¶ 168 (as\n\nof March 31, 2008, Dyson had 38 cases to investigate with a backlog of 28 cases); id. ¶ 215 (as\n\nof March 31, 2008, Washington had 42 cases to investigate with a backlog of 33 cases); see also\n\n¶¶ 438, 445 (caseworker supervised by Ekwem had, in March, 2008, “40 cases assigned her,”\n\nwhich increased thereafter to “57 cases”). Thus, from the face of the Complaint at least, it seems\n\nthat, contrary to Peters’ claim, other caseworkers in her unit with similar backlogs were, in fact,\n\nalso written up, including American-born caseworkers (McCall, Dyson and Washington) and\n\ncaseworkers older than Peters who do not claim age discrimination (McCall).\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 42 of 94\n\f       Moreover, other allegations make clear that the increased assignment of cases was not\n\njust to black caseworkers. An Indian caseworker was also assigned a large number of cases, id.\n\n¶¶ 176-85, and of fourteen caseworkers with 40 or more cases, eleven were older than 40 years\n\nof age and five of those older workers were foreign born caseworkers from Africa, the Caribbean\n\nIslands and India. Id. ¶¶ 183-84. This suggests that the majority of caseworkers assigned a large\n\ncaseload were not foreign-born and that the increase in reports of child abuse and neglect\n\nincreased the workload across the board. In addition, it suggests that older caseworkers, no\n\nmatter their race or ethnicity, were assigned and expected to deal with an increased load,\n\npresumably because they were more experienced.\n\n       Another judge on this Court has reached a similar conclusion in dismissing equal\n\nprotection claims of hostile work environment and intentional discrimination of Patricia Ivey, a\n\nproposed plaintiff-intervenor in this action. See Ivey, 789 F. Supp. 2d at 65 (Jackson, J.). In that\n\ncase, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant “created a hostile work environment for older\n\ncaseworkers . . . by assigning them an overwhelming number of cases and then threatening them\n\nwith disciplinary action if they did not eliminate their backlog,” while “younger caseworkers\n\nwere not assigned as many cases . . . .” Id. at 70. Judge Jackson found the allegations\n\ninsufficient to meet the plausibility threshold in Iqbal in view of the common sense questions\n\nabout how much smaller the caseloads of younger workers were compared to those of the older\n\nemployees and “what was the level of experience of the younger workers?” Id. at 70. She also\n\nscrutinized the plausibility of the plaintiff’s allegation that the assignment of a large caseload\n\nwas motivated by some discriminatory animus and concluded that “there are multiple other\n\ninferences that can be drawn from these allegations.” Id. at 71. Judge Jackson observed, “[f]or\n\nexample, at a time when the Agency was under intense public scrutiny, one reasonable\n\n\n\n                                            Page 43 of 94\n\finterpretation of the allegations is that more cases were assigned to older caseworkers because of\n\ntheir superior experience and knowledge of child protective services.” Id.\n\n       The instant allegations make apparent that the CFSA-CPS work environment was\n\nstressful and that this stress increased in 2008 after the Jacks tragedy, with supervisors pressing\n\nto ensure satisfactory job performance by caseworkers. Indeed, in the wake of the deaths of the\n\nfour Jacks children, increased scrutiny within the agency on job performance would be a\n\ncommon sense response to such a tragic wake-up call. Even a highly stressful work environment\n\nis not the same as a hostile work environment imbued with the requisite pervasive discriminatory\n\nanimus to support a Title VII claim. While Peters complains that she was penalized for her job\n\nperformance, this simply does not constitute an adverse employment action because of her\n\nprotected status, when she concedes in the Complaint that she “could not eliminate her backlog\n\nno matter how many hours she worked,” Compl. ¶ 84, and other allegations make apparent that\n\nothers were similarly over-loaded with cases and penalized for their backlogs.

Moore does not\n\nindicate how frequently such remarks were made.

Compl. ¶¶ 247, 249. She alleges that she was “excluded from many\n\nmeetings,” yet also complains about Supervisor F’s conduct towards her when she “did attend\n\nmeetings.” Id. ¶¶ 255-56. After one incident, apparently in 2001, when Supervisor F “began\n\nscreaming at her,” Moore complained to human resources and received an apology from the\n\nsupervisor. Id. ¶¶ 257-59. These are clearly upsetting work incidents but such travails without\n\n\n\n                                           Page 46 of 94\n\fany other indication that they were due to her protected status, is not enough to show a hostile\n\nwork environment. Moore also complains about her detail as a “hotline caseworker” following\n\nthe Jacks tragedy. She alleges, however, that she was not the only supervisor “detailed” to assist\n\nwith the surge of child abuse and neglect reports occurring after the Jacks tragedy, although she\n\nclaims to be the only supervisor placed in a “hotline caseworker” position. Id. ¶ 285. While\n\ndetailed as a hotline caseworker, she “received compliments on her work and a very good job\n\nperformance evaluation,” and following the detail, she was reinstated to a supervisory position\n\nwith a staff. Id. ¶¶ 285, 291, 292. Positive feed-back and evaluations, as well as restoration to a\n\nfull management position, are inconsistent with a claim that she was discriminated against in a\n\nhostile work environment. Thus, without more, her bare allegations about her protected status\n\nare insufficient to show that the treatment Moore received from Supervisor F was because of her\n\nage, national origin or race.\n\n       In addition, in the portion of the Complaint relating to her “Hostile Work Environment”\n\nclaim, Moore does not claim that the harassment was severe to a degree which affected a term,\n\ncondition, or privilege of employment to satisfy the fourth element for this claim. Indeed, co-\n\nplaintiffs give positive reviews of Moore’s work performance. Compl. ¶ 196 (“Dyson\n\nconsidered Ms. Moore to be one of the best supervisors at the agency.”); ¶ 232 (“Washington\n\nenjoyed working under Ms. Moore.”). Moreover, while Moore claims that she “feared that her\n\njob was in jeopardy,” id. ¶ 265, such concern, without more, simply does not constitute an\n\nadverse employment action. See Herbert v.

These retaliation allegations claim (1) “openly abusive” conduct towards\n\nher by Supervisor G, including poor job performance evaluations from Supervisors F and G in\n\n2005, 2006, and 2007, which resulted in making her ineligible for a pay increase; (2) “harsh\n\ntreatment” by Supervisor D in the spring of 2009 that consisted of “regularly shout[ing]” at\n\nMoore and “on at least two occasions threaten[ing] Ms. Moore with disciplinary action;” (3) her\n\n“detail” as a hotline caseworker in CPS to assist with the post-Jacks surge in child abuse and\n\nneglect reports; and (4) removal of her staff, office and position, after she took an unapproved\n\nfour-month leave under the Family Medical Leave Act.

Without plausible\n\nallegations, the claims do not survive the Motion to Dismiss.\n\n       C.      Disparate Treatment Claims of Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore\n\n       As previously noted, the Title VII and ADEA discrimination and retaliation claims of\n\nonly Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore survive the defendant’s exhaustion challenge. The\n\nSecond Amended Complaint contains broad allegations of disparate treatment associated with a\n\nhostile work environment. See, e.g., Compl. at 2 (the defendant “discriminated against them and\n\nsimilarly situated employees on the basis of their race, national origin, age”); id. ¶ 23 (Peters)\n\n(“Similarly situated caseworkers, who were younger or not black, were not bullied by their\n\nsupervisors.”); id. ¶ 98 (McCall) (same); id. ¶ 250 (Moore) (“[Supervisor F] singled Ms. Moore\n\nout for abusive treatment.”). The Second Amended Complaint does not clearly distinguish the\n\nallegations underlying the hostile work environment claim from those showing disparate\n\ntreatment arising from discrete discriminatory acts due to the plaintiffs’ race, age and/or national\n\norigin. See Baird, 662 F.3d at 1253 (noting that plaintiff’s failure to segregate in the complaint\n\nthose events she claims constitute a hostile work environment from discrete acts of\n\ndiscrimination and/or retaliation “doubtless complicates the court’s task”).

Analysis\n\n       The Second Amended Complaint repeatedly alleges in general, conclusory terms that\n\nPlaintiffs Peters, Moore and McCall, along with other employees and the non-filing plaintiffs,\n\n\n\n                                           Page 51 of 94\n\fwere “harassed” or subjected to “abusive treatment.” See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 43-45, 47, 105-07,\n\n114, 154-55, 157 (referring to unnamed Nigerian and Jamaican or foreign-born caseworkers\n\nbeing abused). The specific discrete discriminatory actions allegedly directed at plaintiffs Peters,\n\nMoore and McCall must be teased out of these general assertions in order to assess the\n\nsufficiency of their claims of disparate treatment. Indeed, the defendant’s characterization of the\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations as “disjointed” and as an effort to “throw a host of allegations of\n\ndiscrimination against the wall in an apparent hope that something will stick,” is fairly accurate\n\nand not merely advocacy hyperbole. Def.’s Mem. at 12. The incidents of disparate treatment\n\nalleged by Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore are analyzed below.\n\n                 a.       Alleged Disparate Treatment Actions Against Plaintiffs Peters and\n                          McCall\n\n        The same factual allegations underlying the plaintiffs’ claims of hostile work\n\nenvironment are also apparently used to support the claims of discrete discriminatory actions.\n\nSee Baird, 662 F.3d at 1252 (“[P]laintiffs are free to plead alternative theories of harm that might\n\nstem from the same allegedly harmful conduct.”). Both Peters and McCall claim that Supervisor\n\nA discriminated against them by: (1) at unspecified times apparently between 2005 and 2007, 28\n\nthreatening to write them up, Compl. ¶ 54 (Peters), ¶ 115 (McCall); and (2) in 2008, following\n\nthe Jacks tragedy and surge in child abuse and neglect reports, writing them up for having\n\nbacklogs of cases when other caseworkers with similar backlogs were not written up, id. ¶¶ 83-\n\n85 (Peters), ¶¶ 131-32 (McCall). In addition, Peters claims that, at unspecified times apparently\n\nbetween 2005 and 2007, this supervisor (3) screamed and talked down to her, id. ¶ 52; and (4)\n\n\n\n\n28\n   While the Complaint does not provide the precise timing of the events cited, the Court discerns the time period\n“between 2005 and 2007” based on the chronological order in which the events are described over the years covered\nin the Second Amended Complaint.\n\n                                                 Page 52 of 94\n\ftook inappropriate actions, such as blocking her from leaving her desk and interrupting her\n\nconversations with co-workers or her restroom breaks. Id. ¶¶ 56-58.\n\n       At the outset, the Court must consider the obvious, namely, whether claims stretching\n\nback to 2005 are time-barred. The alleged adverse acts occurring in 2008 or earlier fall outside\n\nthe 300-day statute of limitations for filing an EEOC complaint and are time-barred. Title VII\n\nrequires “aggrieved persons” to file a charge with the EEOC within 180 days after the alleged\n\nunlawful employment practice occurred, but this period is extended to 300 days when the person\n\nhas initially instituted a procedure with a state or local agency. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). A\n\n“work-sharing” arrangement between the EEOC and the District of Columbia Office of Human\n\nRights (“DCOHR”) deems timely-filed EEOC charges as cross-filed with the DCOHR, making\n\nthe deadline for filing EEOC charges in the District of Columbia 300 days from the date of the\n\nalleged discrimination.

These claims simply do not support a claim of disparate treatment.\n\n       McCall makes no disparate treatment allegation that falls within the statutory period.\n\nIndeed, while he complains about being unfairly “written up” for his backlog of cases after the\n\nJacks tragedy, the latest occasion he cites for such a write-up occurred “[i]n the summer of\n\n2008.” Id. ¶ 131. The only other incident he cites within the statutory period is that “[i]n the\n\nsummer of 2009, [he] suffered a groin injury that caused him to take a week off from work,” and\n\nupon his return Supervisor A told him that “she should have written him up for complaining\n\nabout her a year earlier.” Id. ¶ 137. This appears to be an allegation of retaliation rather than\n\ndisparate treatment, however, and no other information is provided to assist the Court in\n\nunderstanding the purpose for which that allegation is made. In short, McCall has not made out\n\na timely claim of disparate treatment.\n\n       b.      Alleged Disparate Treatment Actions Against Plaintiff Moore\n\n       Moore claims that her supervisors from 2000 to 2008 discriminated against her by: (1)\n\nscreaming at or making disparaging remarks about her, id. ¶¶ 263, 269; (2) regularly threatening\n\nto write her up and actually writing her up for “borderline insubordination,” id. ¶¶ 261, 301; (3)\n\nexcluding her from staff meetings and lunches, id. ¶¶ 255, 257, 260; (4) giving her poor job\n\nperformance evaluations in 2005, 2006 and 2007, id. ¶¶ 274-80; and (5) detailing her to serve as\n\na “hotline caseworker” following the Jacks tragedy, id. ¶ 285. To the extent that any of these\n\nallegations constitute disparate treatment, they are all time-barred. Moore filed her “Charge of\n\nDiscrimination” with the EEOC on December 8, 2009, see ECF No. 30-3 at 1, and therefore, any\n\nallegations concerning events that occurred before February 11, 2009 are untimely.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 55 of 94\n\f        The only allegations occurring between February 11, 2009 and her resignation in\n\nNovember 2009 asserted by Moore that may support a disparate treatment claim are that after\n\nSupervisor D became her supervisor in the spring of 2009, he “regularly shouted at [her] in the\n\npresence of her staff,” Compl. ¶ 300, and removed her job responsibilities upon her return from\n\nan unapproved four-month FMLA leave, id. ¶¶ 303-08. These allegations simply are not\n\nsufficient to state a claim of disparate treatment. Nowhere does Moore allege that Supervisor D\n\ntreated her harshly due to her protected status. Even harsh treatment by a supervisor does not\n\nsupport an employment discrimination claim, absent any assertion that the treatment was due to\n\nthe plaintiff’s race, age or national origin. Indeed, Moore indicates that her relationship with\n\nSupervisor D started off well, id. ¶ 299 (“[Supervisor D] was initially sympathetic . . .”), which is\n\nnot consistent with the behavior of a supervisor motivated by racial animus.\n\n        Moreover, it strains common sense to attribute the removal of Moore’s job\n\nresponsibilities to disparate treatment. Not only does she not make that allegation, she concedes\n\nthat she took a four-month leave from her job that was not approved by her supervisor.\n\n        In order to meet the requirement of showing an adverse employment action for a\n\ndisparate treatment claim under Title VII or the ADEA, both Peters and Moore claim that their\n\nresignations were constructive discharges. 29 Id. ¶¶ 93-4 (Peters); ¶ 311 (Moore); Pls.’ Mem. at\n\n22. McCall claims that he was forced to accept a transfer out of the CPS that reduced his take\n\nhome pay. Compl. ¶¶ 138-40. Even assuming as true that the resignations and transfer were\n\nadverse employment actions, these plaintiffs fail to show that they were subject to any discrete\n\n\n\n\n29\n   Moore alleges in the Second Amended Complaint that she resigned, Compl. ¶ 311, and in her EEOC “Charge of\nDiscrimination” that “[a]s of 11-23-09 I am on leave pending my retirement effective 12-31-09.” ECF No. 30-3.\nWhether Moore resigned or retired is immaterial since under either circumstance the Court will construe her\nallegation as one of constructive discharge.\n\n                                                Page 56 of 94\n\facts of discrimination because of their race, age or national origin and therefore that there was\n\nany causal connection to their resignations or transfer.\n\n       D.        Retaliation Claims of Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore\n\n       Plaintiffs Peters, McCall and Moore each claim that they were retaliated against for\n\ncomplaining about the discriminatory conduct of their supervisors. The defendant contends that\n\n“the Complaint itself shows there was a legitimate reason for the purportedly retaliatory acts”\n\nand therefore the plaintiffs fail to make out a prima facie case of retaliation. Def.’s Mem. at 19.\n\nThe Court agrees that the retaliatory acts alleged are either time-barred or are insufficient as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n       1.        Legal Standard\n\n       Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer:\n\n            to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed\n            any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,\n            or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\n            any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this\n            subchapter.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).\n\n       To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that\n\n“(1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and\n\n(3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.” Hamilton v.\n\nGeithner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1357 (D.C.

Thus, adverse actions giving rise to retaliation claims are broader than\n\nfor disparate impact claims and are “not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms\n\nand conditions of employment,” but reach any harm that “well might have dissuaded a\n\nreasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Baird, 662 F.3d at\n\n1249 (quoting Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 68). Yet, the Court in Burlington Northern\n\ndistinguished “materially adverse” actions from “trivial harms,” “petty slights,” and “minor\n\nannoyances.” Id. at 68. The Court also noted that “[c]ontext matters” and “the significance of\n\nany given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.” Id. at 69; see\n\nalso id. (“[A]n act that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.”) (citation\n\nomitted). As discussed above, resigning, retiring or transferring from a position, as plaintiffs\n\nPeters, Moore and McCall did, respectively, may constitute an adverse employment action of\n\nconstructive discharge or involuntary transfer if the plaintiff shows that the resignation,\n\n\n\n                                            Page 58 of 94\n\fretirement or transfer occurred under conditions that forced that choice. Baird, 662 F.3d at 1248-\n\n49.\n\n         Finally, the third element of the test requiring a causal link between the protected activity\n\nand the adverse employment action may be satisfied merely by close temporal proximity\n\nbetween the two events.

Analysis\n\n         Set against the applicable legal standard for showing a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nretaliation claims of Peters, McCall and Moore fall short. The retaliation claims of these three\n\nplaintiffs are discussed below.\n\n\n\n                                             Page 59 of 94\n\f                  a.       Retaliation Claims of Plaintiffs Peters and McCall\n\n         Both Peters and McCall allege that they engaged in protected activity on two occasions.\n\nFirst, in 2007, they complained to management personnel about the abusive conduct of\n\nSupervisor A, resulting in a meeting convened by Supervisor B at which they “accused\n\nSupervisor A of race discrimination.” Compl. ¶¶ 69-73, 119-21. Although they were assured\n\n“that there would be no retaliation,” Supervisor A “became very hostile.” Id. ¶¶ 73, 123.\n\nSecond, “in 2008 and 2009,” Peters and McCall lodged complaints with Supervisors C and D\n\nabout Supervisor A’s actions in writing them up and threatening penalties for their backlog of\n\ncases in the aftermath of the Jacks tragedy, even though other caseworkers in the unit with\n\nsimilar backlogs were not written up. Id. ¶¶ 79-89, ¶¶ 128-32. According to Peters and McCall,\n\ndespite their complaints to management about Supervisor A’s treatment, “neither [Supervisor C\n\nor D] took steps to end the abuse.” Id. ¶ 88; see also id. ¶ 133. Their requests for transfer were\n\ndenied. Id. ¶¶ 89, 134. When poor job evaluations led to a proposed suspension in October,\n\n2009, Peters resigned. Id. ¶ 93. When Supervisor D advised McCall that he was facing a write-\n\nup, McCall transferred out of CPS in August, 2009. 30 Id. ¶ 138.\n\n         At the outset, again, the Court must consider the timeliness of these allegations of\n\nretaliation that date back to 2007. The first allegation of retaliation in the form of increased\n\nhostility from Supervisor A towards Peters and McCall appears to be time-barred. The vague\n\ntiming set forth in the Second Amended Complaint indicates that the increased hostility of\n\nSupervisor A began in 2007 and, therefore, occurred long before the statutory 300-day period in\n\nJanuary 2009 before the filing of these plaintiffs’ EEOC charges. In any event, even if this\n\nallegation of retaliation were considered to be timely, the claim does not survive the Motion to\n\n30\n   In their opposition brief, the plaintiffs state that McCall transferred out of CPS “after being threatened by\n[Supervisor A] with a write up that he felt would lead to his termination,” Pls.’ Mem. at 23, but the Complaint\nattributes this final write-up threat to Supervisor D. Compl. ¶138.\n\n                                                   Page 60 of 94\n\fDismiss. Other than increased hostility from Supervisor A, neither Peters nor McCall assert that\n\nthey were subjected to an adverse employment action in connection with their 2007 complaint to\n\nmanagement about Supervisor A’s mistreatment of them. Thus, this allegation simply cannot\n\nplausibly support a retaliation claim.\n\n       With regard to the second incidence of retaliation, the Second Amended Complaint is not\n\nentirely clear when “[i]n 2008 and 2009” Peters made informal complaints to program managers\n\nSupervisors C and D “about [Supervisor A] . . . to end the abuse.” Compl. ¶ 88. No dates\n\nwhatsoever are provided for when McCall “complained to several managers, including\n\n[Supervisors C and D], about [Supervisor A’s] abusive behavior.” Id. ¶ 133. Nevertheless, both\n\nPeters and McCall allege that following these complaints, nothing changed and presumably\n\nSupervisor A’s abusive conduct continued. Even assuming that these allegations are timely, they\n\nare insufficient to support a claim of retaliation for several reasons.\n\n       First, the Court finds that Peters and McCall’s complaints to Supervisor C and D do not\n\nclearly constitute protected activity. While informal complaints to management may constitute\n\nprotected activity, the plaintiffs must clearly complain about discriminatory treatment. While the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint suggests that Peters and McCall complained to management about\n\nSupervisor A assigning them too many cases and then penalizing them for a backlog when other\n\ncaseworkers were not penalized, they do not allege that they complained about being targeted for\n\nthis harsher treatment due to their race, age or national origin or even in retaliation for their prior\n\ncomplaints about her.\n\n       Second, the fact that nothing changed after they complained in 2008 and 2009 about\n\nSupervisor A to Supervisors C and D undercuts their claims of retaliation. According to the\n\nallegations, even after they complained, “the abuse” from Supervisor A continued in the form of\n\n\n\n                                             Page 61 of 94\n\ftoo many cases and the imposition of performance penalties for their backlogs. In other words,\n\ntheir allegations do not even suggest that following their complaints, Supervisor A became more\n\nhostile, penalized them more severely or assigned them even more cases than before their\n\ncomplaints as retaliation for their complaints.\n\n       Third, the adverse employment actions that Peters and McCall allege to have stemmed\n\nfrom their 2008 and 2009 complaints to Supervisors C and D do not appear to be causally\n\nconnected, even if those complaints were deemed to be protected activity. The allegations can\n\nbe construed to identify three adverse employment actions: denial of transfers, unfair penalties\n\nfor their backlogs of cases and constructive discharge or transfer. The defendant argues that “the\n\nComplaint itself shows there was a legitimate reason for the purportedly retaliatory acts.” Def.’s\n\nMem. at 19. Specifically, the defendant contends that the Complaint’s acknowledgement of the\n\nsurge in reported child abuse and neglect cases following the January 2008 Jacks tragedy\n\nprovides “a legitimate nondiscriminatory . . . reason for the increased workload that was entirely\n\ndivorced from any alleged protected activity.” Id. at 20. The defendant is correct.\n\n       Regarding the denial of transfer requests from both Peters and McCall, Compl. ¶¶ 89,\n\n134, it is not entirely clear whether this allegation is meant to indicate an adverse employment\n\naction. Assuming it is so intended, however, it does not suffice. The denial of their transfer\n\nrequests at a time when CPS was handling a “surge in child abuse and neglect reports,” id. ¶ 76,\n\nand at least one co-plaintiff Augustine Ekwem alleges that he had too many caseworkers to\n\nsupervise, id. ¶¶ 473-78, more plausibly appears to have been a reasonable management decision\n\nunder the circumstances, rather than a retaliatory act. Denial of requests for transfer, without any\n\nallegation that requiring an employee to stay in an assigned position for which the objective\n\nterms of pay, rank, and general tasks have remained the same, simply do not constitute an\n\n\n\n                                           Page 62 of 94\n\fadverse action to support a retaliation claim.

Dec. 9, 2011) (plaintiff’s claim that she was denied\n\nreassignment, without identifying any “objectively tangible harm” resulting from defendant’s\n\nrefusal to reassign her, was not enough to show “how this denial could possibly dissuade a\n\nreasonable worker from ‘making or supporting a charge of discrimination.’”); Dorns v.

Peters\n\nalleges that she was assigned an “overwhelming number of cases” and admits that her backlog\n\nwas growing and she “could not eliminate” it. Compl. ¶¶ 79-84. Likewise, McCall had a\n\ngrowing backlog and an “overwhelming caseload.” Id. ¶¶ 127-29. Both Peters and McCall were\n\nlong-term CPS employees and therefore it is reasonable that management would expect them to\n\nbe able to handle more cases than less experienced caseworkers. While Peters and McCall may\n\nperceive that they were treated more harshly than others in the unit, the job performance\n\npenalties meted out to them due to their backlogs were not unfounded and other allegations in the\n\nSecond Amended Complaint undercut their claim that they were the only caseworkers with, and\n\npenalized for, their backlogs.

Retaliation Claim of Plaintiff Moore\n\n        Plaintiff Moore alleges four instances in which she complained about mistreatment from\n\nher supervisors: (1) in 2001, she complained to “human resources” about Supervisor F after this\n\nsupervisor requested that Moore not speak at a meeting and screamed at her, and Moore’s\n\ncomplaint prompted an apology from this supervisor, Compl. ¶¶ 257-59; (2) in 2005, she\n\ncomplained to “human resources” and the “Employee Assistance Program” about Supervisor G\n\nscreaming at her, id. ¶¶ 269-72; (3) in 2007, she complained to “human resources” about\n\nSupervisor G’s poor evaluation of her based on “the fact that [she] had filed complaints against\n\nhim with human resources,” id. ¶¶ 280-81; and (4) in 2009, she complained to Supervisor D\n\nabout retaliatory treatment from her prior Supervisors G and F, and Moore alleges that\n\nSupervisor D then “became abusive as well.” Id. ¶¶ 297-99.\n\n        The Complaint is not clear whether Moore claims that all four instances in which she\n\ncomplained about her three supervisors over the course of eight years is protected activity that\n\nprompted retaliation. Since she filed her EEOC charge on December 8, 2009, however, any\n\nclaims of retaliation occurring prior to February 11, 2009 are time-barred. Neither party\n\naddresses the timeliness issue in any detail, however. Indeed, the plaintiffs’ opposition\n\nmemorandum focuses on the first three instances of her complaints to human resources.\n\nSpecifically, Moore asserts that her claim of retaliation is established because, after lodging her\n\ncomplaints, presumably in 2001, 2005 and 2007, about Supervisors G and F, “she was\n\ntransferred to a non-supervisory position; and there is a causal link between her complaint[s]\n\nabout [those supervisors] and her detail to a non-supervisory position.” Pls.’ Mem. at 24. 31\n\n\n31\n  Moore does not appear to contend that her alleged constructive discharge was an adverse employment action in\nretaliation for her complaints about her supervisors. Indeed, the multiple years between her complaints about\n\n                                                 Page 66 of 94\n\fEven if the Court were to assume this claim was timely, Moore has not sufficiently alleged\n\nprotected activity or a causal link to support her retaliation claim.\n\n        This Circuit has made clear that, “[n]ot every complaint garners its author protection\n\nunder Title VII.” Broderick, 437 F.3d at 1232 (plaintiff’s written complaint to her supervisors\n\ndid not constitute a protected activity because she complained of her treatment but did not allege\n\nthat she was suffering discrimination or retaliation); see also Lewis v.

Moore has failed to meet this requirement.\n\n\n\n\nSupervisors F and G and her resignation would defeat any causal connection between those events. Moreover, her\nclaim of constructive discharge stems from her allegation that her job responsibilities were removed following her\nreturn from a four month leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FLMA). Id. ¶¶ 303-11. When she\nrequested the leave, her supervisor “told Ms. Moore that her request would not be approved.” Id. ¶ 304.\nNevertheless, Moore took the leave, returning to work in October, 2009 to “discover[] that [CFSA] had stopped her\npaychecks, removed her name from the computer system, and given her position, office and staff to a newly hired\nemployee.” Id. ¶ 308. There is no allegation that Moore’s leave request was denied for any discriminatory reason or\nthat any other similarly situated supervisors were granted leave requests when her request was denied. Taking a\nleave for an extended period of four months after a supervisor has communicated that the leave was not approved\nprovides a legitimate reason for the actions taken by CFSA and would defeat her claim of constructive discharge.\n\n                                                  Page 67 of 94\n\f        Even assuming that the complaints Moore made to human resources in 2001, 2005 and\n\n2007 preceding her detail as a “hotline caseworker,” were timely and statutorily protected\n\nactivity, she would still fail to state a cognizable retaliation claim for two reasons. First, her\n\ntemporary detail does not constitute an adverse employment action. The Second Amended\n\nComplaint is replete with allegations about the surge in child abuse and neglect reports after the\n\nJacks tragedy that overwhelmed the caseworkers at CPS with backlogged cases. Moore was one\n\nof four supervisors re-assigned to CPS to assist with this surge in cases. While Moore alleges\n\nthat she was the only such supervisor demoted to caseworker, she does not allege that her pay\n\nwas docked or her benefits diminished in any way or that this temporary re-assignment had any\n\npractical consequences. See Mungin, 116 F.3d at 1557 (“[C]hanges in assignments or work-\n\nrelated duties do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment actions if unaccompanied by a\n\ndecrease in salary or work hour changes.”); Ndondji v.

Furthermore, in the context of\n\nthe serious workload increase that CPS faced, as described by the plaintiffs in their Complaint,\n\nthe legitimate reasons for management’s temporary re-assignment of Moore to assist in\n\naddressing the serious surge in reports of child neglect and abuse, appears to have been\n\nappropriate. Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1191 (courts should not engage in “judicial micromanagement\n\nof business practices by second-guessing employers’ decisions.”) (citation omitted). In fact,\n\nMoore alleges that she was very effective in her detailed position and “closed approximately a\n\nthousand investigations.” Compl. ¶ 290. Rather than a discriminatory or retaliatory action, her\n\ntemporary re-assignment appears to have been a sound administrative step to make effective use\n\nof personnel to deal with a significant workload problem. Moreover, Moore was reinstated to\n\nher supervisory position one year after her detail and “given a staff.” Compl. ¶ 292. This is\n\nprobative evidence that the management decision to give her a temporary detail did not have\n\ninvidious motivation since that would be inconsistent with the decision to reinstate her. In other\n\nwords, her claim is “seriously undercut” by the allegation that the same managers who\n\ndiscriminated against her also reinstated her. Waterhouse v.

This undermines significantly any\n\ncausal link between the purported protected activity and the allegedly retaliatory temporary re-\n\nassignment.\n\n       In sum, Moore has failed to allege that she engaged in protected activity and, even if she\n\ndid, her temporary re-assignment does not constitute an adverse employment action, let alone a\n\nretaliatory act caused by her complaints, sufficient to state a claim for retaliation.\n\n       Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss the claims of retaliation by Plaintiffs\n\nPeters, McCall and Moore is granted.\n\n       E.      Constitutional Claims Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1981\n\n       The plaintiffs assert discrimination claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1981, “which do\n\nnot require administrative exhaustion.” Pls.’ Mem. at 11.

Evaluation of the factual allegations pertinent\n\nto each of these constitutional claims asserted on behalf of all nine plaintiffs would be a\n\nchallenge since, as the defendant points out, “[p]laintiffs make no effort to tie these claims to a\n\nspecific statute.” Def.’s Mem. at 12. Nevertheless, the claims suffer the fatal flaw of not\n\nsufficiently alleging a custom or practice of the municipality to support them.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Page 70 of 94\n\f        1.

Analysis\n\n       The plaintiffs’ allegations do not establish that a custom, policy or practice of the District\n\nof Columbia caused their alleged injuries, which is fatal to their claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981\n\nand 1983. Other than conclusory allegations in the prefatory section of the Second Amended\n\nComplaint, the plaintiffs do not allege that any District official explicitly condoned, knowingly\n\nignored, or failed to respond in a manner showing deliberate indifference to discriminatory\n\nactivity based on race, age or national origin within CFSA. On the contrary, the allegations\n\nmake clear that steps were taken to address perceived or overt discriminatory activity at CFSA.\n\nFor example, when employees complained of abusive conduct on the part of Supervisor A,\n\nSupervisor B convened a meeting about the complaints and assured employees, including some\n\nof the plaintiffs, that there would be no retaliation. Compl. ¶¶ 71-72, ¶¶ 119-22. Similarly, when\n\na Nigerian caseworker and African-American employee had an altercation in the workplace and\n\nyelled racial epithets, “both workers were suspended.” Id. ¶¶ 536-40. When Moore complained\n\n\n\n\n                                            Page 72 of 94\n\fabout Supervisor F’s conduct towards her in 2001, Supervisor F was prompted to apologize to\n\nher. Id. ¶ 259.\n\n        Moreover, among the plaintiffs are several supervisors and management personnel who\n\nallege expressly that they took actions to stop any perceived discrimination or retaliation. For\n\nexample, plaintiff Courts-Marshall, who was “put in charge of the Child Protective Services\n\nAdministration at the Child and Family Services Agency,” id. ¶ 570, alleges that she “refused to\n\nfire any of the people on the list” whom she believed were put on the list “for retaliatory\n\nreasons.” Id. ¶¶ 617-18. She also instructed “program managers,” who are mid-level\n\nmanagement at CFSA, to help “supervisors whose names were on the list.” Id. ¶ 620. In fact,\n\nshe alleges that she “launched a campaign to make sure that all social workers had the training\n\nand support they needed to perform their jobs.” Id. ¶ 619. In addition, plaintiff Meade was a\n\ntraining supervisor in CPS and she claims that “Human Resources offered diversity training on\n\ntopics like race discrimination and sexual harassment . . .” Id. ¶ 514. These allegations make\n\nclear that the District did not have a custom or policy that caused any alleged injuries of the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n        Accordingly, the plaintiffs’ discrimination claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1981\n\ncannot be sustained and will be dismissed.\n\n        F.        District of Columbia Human Rights Act Claims\n\n        The Second Amended Complaint asserts that the plaintiffs notified the Mayor’s office of\n\nthe instant civil action against the city on December 21, 2009, and that the “District of Columbia\n\nGovernment’s Office of Risk Management reviewed the claims, determined that none were tort\n\nissues, and closed the files.” Compl. ¶ 5. Among the claims asserted is one for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief and damages to protect and redress “deprivation of rights secured by the District\n\nof Columbia Human Rights Act of 1977” (“DCHRA”).

PLAINTIFFS-INTERVENORS’ MOTIONS TO INTERVENE\n        The plaintiffs seek to double the number of plaintiffs in this suit with two motions to\n\npermit nine additional current or former employees of CFSA to intervene as plaintiffs of right,\n\nunder either Rule 24(a)(2), or permissively, under Rule 24(b). FED. R. CIV. P. 24; Movants’ Mot.\n\nto Intervene, ECF No. 24 (“First Motion”); Movants’ Second Mot. to Intervene, ECF No. 27\n\n(“Second Motion”). 33 Since the Court has granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss the Second\n\nAmended Complaint, the motions to intervene must be denied as moot. Even if any part of the\n\noriginal claims remained, the motions to intervene would be denied on the merits for the reasons\n\nset forth below.\n\n\n33\n  The Court notes that the First Motion seeks intervention “pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a),” yet asks for\n“permissive intervention as plaintiffs in this action.” First Motion, at 1. The Second Motion simply does not\nspecify under which prong of Rule 24 the Movants seek to intervene. Second Motion, at 1-3. Nevertheless, the\nCourt construes these motions as seeking intervention both as of right and permissively. See Movants’ Reply Mem.,\nECF No. 26, at 1 (clarifying that Movants are seeking intervention under Rule 24(a) “and/or” Rule 24 (b)).\n\n                                                 Page 75 of 94\n\f       The defendant opposes both of the motions to intervene. Def.’s Opp’n to First Mot. to\n\nIntervene (“Def.’s Opp’n First Mot.”), ECF No. 25; Def.’s Opp’n to Second Mot. to Intervene\n\n(“Def.’s Opp’n Second Mot.”), ECF No. 28. The defendant contends that the nine would-be\n\nplaintiff-intervenors (“Movants”) should not be granted leave to intervene since the allegations\n\nunderlying their claims are sufficiently different that the requirements for intervention under both\n\nRule 24(a)(2) and (b) are not satisfied. The Court agrees.\n\n       In the discussion that follows, the Court will first review the legal standards applicable to\n\nboth prongs of Rule 24 and then describe in detail the Movants’ claims, in order to evaluate the\n\ndifferences in those claims from those of the plaintiffs, since those differences are the basis for\n\nthe defendant’s objection to these motions. Finally, the Court will assess the merits of the\n\nmotions for intervention based upon the applicable legal standards.\n\n       A.      Legal Standard For Intervention\n       Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the requirements for both\n\nintervention as of right and permissive intervention. See FED. R. CIV. P. 24 (a) & (b). While\n\n“[i]n theory” a court has “no discretion when intervention is under Rule 24(a),” 7C Wright,\n\nMiller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure, § 1913 (3d ed. 2007), practically speaking, even\n\nthis basis for intervention involves “a measure of judicial discretion . . . .” Fund for Animals v.\n\nNorton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185891\"><a href=\"/opinion/185891/fund-animals-v-norton-gale/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (D.C.

Intervention of Right\n\n       Rule 24(a)(2) states in relevant part:\n\n       On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who . . . claims an\n       interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is\n       so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede\n       the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately\n       represent that interest.\n\n       The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has parsed the language of Rule 24(a)(2) to\n\nrequire four factors in order for a movant to qualify for intervention of right: “(1) the timeliness\n\nof the motion; (2) whether the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction\n\nwhich is the subject of the action; (3) whether the applicant is so situated that the disposition of\n\nthe action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant’s ability to protect that\n\ninterest; and (4) whether the applicant’s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.”\n\nFund for Animals, 322 F.3d at 731 (quoting Mova Pharm.

The Movants’ Claims\n         The nine Movants include seven former CFSA employees (Patricia Ivey, Delores\n\nJunious, Emmanuael Mbadiugha, Sophia Mickens-Lewis, Nicky Odaka, Njideka Odiana and\n\nFidelia Phillips) and two current CFSA employees (Nellie Lahia and Edwin Monono). Unlike\n\nthe plaintiffs, who complain about their treatment while employed at CPS, only three of the\n\nMovants (Ivey, Lahai, Mickens-Lewis) were employed within this component of the CFSA. The\n\nother six Movants complain about their treatment in the following components of CFSA: In-\n\nHome and Reunification Services, the Family Stabilization Branch, and the Licensing &\n\nMonitoring Division. Only one of the Movants served as a CFSA supervisor or manager\n\n(Mickens-Lewis) and the remainder are non-managerial employees. The Movants were\n\nemployed at CFSA for varying lengths of time, ranging from about eighteen years to only a few\n\nyears. As with the nine plaintiffs, all nine of the Movants claim that they were discriminated\n\nagainst on the basis of race and subjected to a hostile work environment during at least some\n\nportion of their employment at CFSA. In addition, six of the Movants (Junious, Mbadiugha,\n\nMickens-Lewis, Monono, Odiana and Phillips) claim retaliation; six Movants (Lahia,\n\nMbadiugha, Monono, Odaka, Odiana and Phillips) claim discrimination on the basis of national\n\norigin; and two Movants (Mbadiugha and Monono) claim age discrimination.\n\n34\n  Whether standing is also required for permissive intervention in this Circuit is an unresolved issue.

Non-Managerial Movants\n        Edwin Monono is a 53-year old black man from Cameroon, who worked as a CPS\n\ncaseworker in three time periods: from 1993 until 1996, from 1997 until 2001, and again from\n\n2008 through the Spring of 2009, when he was detailed from the Licensing and Monitoring\n\nDivision to CPS “due to massive backlogs following the Jacks tragedy.” First Mot., Ex. 1,\n\nCompl.-In-Intervention (“First Compl.-Int.”), ECF No. 24-1, ¶¶ 20-22, 39, 48. Monono claims\n\nracial and national origin discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation based upon\n\nallegations, inter alia, that (1) his workplace is “saturated with stereotypes about Africans being\n\ndishonest, lazy, and just it in for the money,” id. ¶ 26; (2) “American social workers made\n\nderogatory comments about the skin complexions, facial features, and accents of African\n\ncaseworkers,” id. ¶¶ 25, 27; (3) during his 2008 detail to CPS, he worked in excess of 40 hours\n\nper week but did not submit overtime pay requests because his managers accused African social\n\nworkers of “stealing overtime” and threatened African social workers with audits and\n\ndisciplinary actions; he nevertheless “wanted to continue working in [CPS],” id. ¶¶ 40-6; (4)\n\nupon his transfer back to the Licensing and Monitoring Division, he was assigned more cases\n\nthan his American co-workers, id. ¶ 49; (5) “[i]n 2010,” he complained about the “impropriety of\n\n\n\n\n                                           Page 81 of 94\n\fa particular assignment,” and was “written up” by Supervisor K, 35 id. ¶ 50; and (6) despite\n\nrequests to be transferred to other units, he remains assigned the same supervisor and “continues\n\nto be harassed,” while American caseworkers who complained about the same supervisor were\n\ntransferred, id. ¶¶ 50-53.\n\n        Patricia Ivey is a 58-year old African-American woman, who worked as a CPS\n\ncaseworker from 2005 until she resigned in August 2008. First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 55-59. Ivey\n\nclaims racial discrimination and hostile work environment, which interfered with her ability to\n\ndo her job, id. ¶¶ 97-98. Ivey provides no allegation of any action taken against her personally,\n\nbut bases her claims on her observations that (1) black caseworkers “from Africa and the\n\nCaribbean Islands, were bullied by their supervisors,” id. ¶ 61; (2) African caseworkers were\n\nwarned not to submit overtime pay requests and managers accused African social workers of\n\n“stealing overtime” and “threatened” African caseworkers with audits and disciplinary actions,\n\nid. ¶¶ 72-76; and (3) from 2005 to 2008, she observed Supervisor A “constantly harass a\n\nNigerian caseworker,” and a Jamaican caseworker, Angella Peters, whose repeated requests to be\n\ntransferred to other units were denied, id. ¶¶ 83, 86, 87-91.\n\n        Nellie Lahai is a 62-year old black woman from Sierra Leone, who has worked for\n\nCFSA for about 18 years and as a CPS caseworker from 2003 until January, 2009, when she was\n\n“involuntarily transferred” to the Licensing and Monitoring Division. Second Mot., Ex. 1,\n\nCompl.- in-Intervention, ECF No. 27-1 (“Second Compl.-Int.”), ¶¶ 11-12, 15, 59. Lahai claims\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race and national origin, retaliation and hostile work environment,\n\nbased upon allegations that (1) Supervisor H, who became CPS’ program administrator in 2004,\n\n“created a lot of racial tension at the agency,” id. ¶ 24; (2) in the Fall of 2005, Lahai filed a\n\n35\n  Supervisor K is unnamed and the Complaint provides no race or ethnic information about this supervisor.

First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 102, 103, 105, 164. She claims racial and\n\nnational origin discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation based upon allegations\n\nthat (1) between 2001 and 2003, when she was assigned to In-Home and Reunification Services,\n\nAmerican social workers hired at the same time as she were automatically promoted upon\n\ncompletion of their one-year probationary period, while Odiana was not promoted for several\n\nyears, id. ¶¶ 114-16; (2) after resigning from CFSA in 2007, she was re-hired in 2008 and\n\nassigned to In-Home and Reunification Services, instead of the assignment she expected in a\n\ncollaborative position in order to have a regular schedule for her to care for her three young\n\nchildren, id. ¶¶ 127-33; (3) in February 2009, Odiana was denied transfer to a collaborative\n\nposition until completion of a one year probationary period, even though some newly hired\n\nAmerican social workers were assigned to the collaborative position, id. ¶¶ 141-48, 151-53, 161-\n\n64; (4) after Odiana complained about not being transferred, two supervisors, Supervisor L and\n\n\n\n                                           Page 83 of 94\n\fSupervisor M, 36 wrote her up in May 2009, September, 2009, and December 2009, the last of\n\nwhich resulted in her termination, id. ¶¶ 154-64.\n\n        Fidelia Phillips is a 53-year old, black woman from Nigeria, who, like Movant Odiana,\n\nworked at CFSA’s In-Home and Reunification Services from to 2001 to 2008. First Compl.-Int.\n\n¶¶ 168-69. She claims racial and national origin discrimination, hostile work environment and\n\nretaliation based upon allegations that (1) after taking family leave, in May 2004, her Supervisor\n\nN 37 was “visibly hostile” towards her, prompting Phillips to complain to the project manager and\n\nprogram administrator about the hostile treatment, id. ¶¶ 185-91; (2) in December, 2004, a new\n\nsupervisor (“Supervisor O”) 38 was also hostile towards her but gave her a “satisfactory” job\n\nperformance with “very derogatory comments,” which prompted her to request a transfer to\n\nanother supervisor but her request was denied, while “two American caseworkers” were\n\ntransferred after complaining about Supervisor O, id. ¶¶ 194-204; (3) between 2006 and 2008,\n\nPhillips was assigned a “significantly heavier [caseload]” than her American co-workers,\n\nrequiring her to work long hours, but the agency consistently refused to approve Phillips’\n\novertime pay requests, id. ¶¶ 206-08; and (4) after a family leave in 2005, despite Supervisor O’s\n\nadvice not to file “an interim report,” Phillips was reprimanded for not having filed the report,\n\nwhich was the “first of several questionable write ups that would result in Phillips’ termination in\n\n2008,” id. ¶¶ 210-14.\n\n\n\n\n36\n  Supervisor L is Elaina McKenzie and Supervisor M is Maura Gaswirth. The First Complaint-in-Intervention\nprovides no race or ethnic information about either of these supervisors. Id. ¶¶ 154, 157.\n37\n  Supervisor N is Diane Robinson, about whom the First Complaint-in-Intervention provides no race or ethnic\ninformation. Id. ¶ 180.\n38\n  Supervisor O is Haylee Liss, about whom the First Complaint-in-Intervention provides no race or ethnic\ninformation.

First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 219-20, 223, 269. He claims racial, age and national origin\n\ndiscrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation based upon allegations that (1) black\n\ncaseworkers, particularly those from Africa and the Caribbean Islands, were bullied by their\n\nsupervisors and American social workers made derogatory comments about African workers, id.\n\n¶¶ 217-18, 246; (2) he was assigned a heavy caseload relative to his American co-workers but his\n\nsupervisors discouraged him from making overtime pay requests, id. ¶¶ 245-49; (3) in 1999, his\n\nSupervisor P 39 became hostile towards him when he left work for his child’s birth, id. ¶¶ 241-43;\n\n(4) Mbadiugha’s requests in 2003 for transfer to CPS and, in 2004, for a supervisor’s position\n\nwere denied, id. ¶¶ 248-57; (5) between 2005 and 2008, Mbadiugha was written up twice by\n\nSupervisor Q 40 for being late for a court hearing and late filings of case plans with the court,\n\neach resulting in a suspension, even though “caseworkers are rarely disciplined” for these\n\nmatters, id. ¶¶ 262-66; and (6) in 2010, Mbadiugha’s new supervisor R 41 wrote up Mbadigha for\n\nfiling case plans with the court after a deadline, which resulted in his termination, id. ¶¶ 267-69.\n\n        Nicky Odaka is a 41-year old black woman from Nigeria, who has worked for ten years\n\nas a social services assistant in CFSA’s In-Home and Reunification Services. Second Compl.-\n\nInt. ¶¶ 62, 64-67. She claims racial and national origin discrimination, and hostile work\n\nenvironment based upon allegations that (1) she routinely worked over 40 hours per week but did\n\n\n39\n  Supervisor P is Theresa Cunningham, about whom the First Complaint-in-Intervention provides no race or ethnic\ninformation. Id. ¶ 241.\n40\n  Supervisor Q is Andrea Brunson, about whom the First Complaint-in-Intervention provides no race or ethnic\ninformation. Id. ¶ 262.\n41\n  Supervisor R is Madeline Jackson-Cooper, about whom the First Complaint-in-Intervention provides no race or\nethnic information. Id. ¶¶ 267-68.\n\n\n                                                 Page 85 of 94\n\fnot submit overtime pay requests because her unnamed supervisor discouraged her from doing\n\nso, id. ¶ 73; (2) she observed that African caseworkers were assigned more cases than American\n\ncounterparts, were blamed and disciplined when excessive caseloads led to problems, and\n\n“routinely heard American co-workers making derogatory comments about Africans,” including\n\n“criticiz[ing] African complexions, facial features and accents,” id. ¶¶ 69-79.\n\n           Delores Junious is a 47-year old black woman, who has been terminated twice from\n\nCFSA’s Family Stabilization Branch, first in 2001 and again in 2008. Second Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 87-\n\n90. She claims racial discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation based upon\n\nallegations that: (1) in April and May 1999, Junious “advocated on behalf” of a new co-worker\n\nin the Family Stabilization Branch and complained to management about discriminatory\n\nassignment of more cases to an entry-level African American social worker than to experienced\n\nwhite social workers, by her white supervisor, Supervisor S, 42 id. ¶¶ 82, 92-100; (2) in late 1999,\n\nJunious was harassed and disciplined by her new black supervisor, Supervisor T, 43 prompting\n\nJunious to complain to management and leading to her 2002 termination, id. ¶¶ 101-06; (3)\n\nfollowing her reinstatement in 2005, Jurious was assigned to the training unit, “not given a\n\nregular assignment,” not promoted to a grade 12 and “never allowed to work overtime,” id. ¶¶\n\n108-13; and (4) “despite having hundreds of hours of leave,” the agency refused to recognize her\n\nleave and “declared her Absent without Leave (AWOL) despite pre-approving her leave\n\nrequests,” leading to her second termination in 2008, id. ¶¶ 114-15.\n\n                    2.      Managerial Movant\n           One of the Movants, Sophia Mickens-Lewis, was a senior manager and acting program\n\nadministrator at CPS during the time period when the plaintiffs and Movants claim that\n\n42\n     Supervisor S is Donna Geraci. Second Compl.-Int. ¶ 92.\n43\n     Supervisor T is Emma Norfleet. Id. ¶ 101.\n\n                                                   Page 86 of 94\n\fdiscriminatory and retaliatory conduct occurred. Mickens-Lewis complains about a hostile work\n\nenvironment during the time that her immediate supervisor was plaintiff Courts-Marshall.\n\n       Mickens-Lewis is a 44-year old African American woman, who worked in CPS as a\n\nsupervisor from 2000 to 2001, as a program manager from 2002 to 2003, as the acting program\n\nadministrator from 2003-2004, and as a program manager from 2004 to 2008, during which time\n\nin the fall of 2005, she served as the CPS acting program administrator, when Courts-Marshall\n\nwas her immediate supervisor. First Compl.-Int. ¶¶ 276-85. She claims racial discrimination,\n\nhostile work environment from 2004 to 2008, and retaliation based upon allegations that (1) in\n\nJanuary 2006, the deputy director of the CFSA, Supervisor I, instructed Courts-Marshall to\n\nterminate “about 15 social workers,” but Mickens-Lewis, together with Courts-Marshall and\n\nSupervisor B, “determined that the social workers on the termination list were performing they\n\n[sic] jobs well but had complained about [Supervisor H’s] discriminatory practices,” id. ¶¶ 296-\n\n310, 326; (2) on two occasions, in 2007 and 2008, Supervisor I directed Mickens-Lewis to\n\nterminate apparently two different African caseworkers, one of whom was the subject of a “a\n\ncomplaint from a family he was investigating,” but after investigation, Mickens-Lewis refused to\n\nterminate the caseworkers, id. ¶¶ 332, 335, 351-52; and (3) in May, 2008, Supervisor I\n\nterminated Mickens-Lewis because “[y]ou all did not do what I told you to do,” id. ¶¶ 360-63.\n\n       C.      Discussion\n       The Movants argue that they should be permitted to intervene “because Intervenors and\n\nPlaintiffs share common claims against Defendant in terms of facts, evidence, and legal\n\ntheories.” First Compl.-Int., at 2. Specifically, the Movants state that both the Movants and\n\nplaintiffs allege they worked “in a hostile work environment at the Child and Family Services\n\nAgency during the past ten years. The hostile work environment was discriminatory and\n\n\n\n                                          Page 87 of 94\n\fretaliatory.” Movants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 29, at 1-2; Movants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 26, at\n\n2.\n\n         The Defendant counters that the pending motions to intervene should be denied since\n\neach Movant has “an independent right of action that he or she can pursue regardless of the\n\noutcome of this proceeding.” Def.’s Opp’n to First Mot., ECF No. 25, at 2-3; Def.’s Opp’n to\n\nSecond Mot., ECF No. 28, at 2-3. Consequently, according to the defendant, the Movants cannot\n\nmake the requisite showing that, absent intervention, their interests would be impeded or\n\nimpaired under Rule 24(a)(2). In addition, the defendant argues that permissive intervention\n\nunder Rule 24(b) should be denied because joining the Movants’ “legally distinct” claims would\n\n“expand the scope of the issues before the Court and delay the current proceedings.” Def.’s\n\nOpp’n to First Mot. at 3; Def.’s Opp’n to Second Mot. at 4. Even if these motions were not\n\nmoot, for these and other reasons discussed below, the Court agrees with the defendant that the\n\nMovants would not be permitted to intervene.\n\n         1.       Movants Would Not Be Entitled to Intervene Of Right\n         The defendant does not dispute that the Movants have standing 44 nor their satisfaction of\n\nthe first and last requirements for intervention of right under Rule 24(a)(2), and the Court agrees\n\nthat, if not moot, the Movants’ intervention motions would be timely and their interests would\n\nnot be adequately represented by the existing parties. The defendant argues only that Movants\n\ncannot meet either the second or third requirements for intervention as of right. See Def.’s\n\nOpp’n to Second Mot. at 2-3. Specifically, the defendant contends that the Movants do not have\n\n\n44\n  A prospective intervenor’s Article III standing presents a question going to this Court’s jurisdiction, which must\nbe addressed first by the Court before proceeding to consideration of the four-part test for intervention of right.

Cir. 2002). The Court concludes that the Movants\nhave met the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing by showing a concrete injury causally connected to\ntheir employment at the CFSA that could be redressed by a favorable decision from this Court. See Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560-61 (1992).\n\n                                                    Page 88 of 94\n\fan interest in the subject matter at issue in the action and that the Movants’ interests would not as\n\na practical matter be impaired or impeded by the disposition of the case. The Court agrees that\n\nthe Movants would not be able to satisfy these requirements and, therefore, their motions to\n\nintervene of right would be denied on the merits.\n\n       First, the Movants have no legally cognizable interest in the specific claims asserted by\n\nthe plaintiffs in this employment discrimination lawsuit. While the Movants may share with the\n\nplaintiffs similar legal claims against the same defendant, the factual sufficiency of each claim\n\nwould be assessed for each plaintiff and movant individually. Indeed, the Movants concede “the\n\nindividual nature of the discrimination/retaliation claims” when they argue that “the interests of\n\nthe Intervenors cannot be adequately protected by the current parties to the litigation.” First Mot.\n\nat 2; Second Mot. at 1.\n\n       Second, even if the Movants had a legally cognizable interest, that interest would not be\n\nimpaired by a judgment on the plaintiffs’ claims. Impairment exists when the decision in a\n\npending matter would foreclose or adversely affect the rights of the proposed intervenor in a\n\nsubsequent proceeding. Even if one or more plaintiffs would have prevailed with a judgment in\n\nhis or her favor, the legal interests and claims of the Movants would, as a practical matter, be\n\nunaffected. As the defendant correctly points out, each Movant has “an independent right of\n\naction that he or she can pursue regardless of the outcome of this proceeding.” Def.’s Opp’n to\n\nSecond Mot., ECF No. 28, at 3.

The record is bare of any evidence that five of the Movants filed a discrimination\n\ncharge with the EEOC, received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC or otherwise exhausted their\n\nadministrative remedies. Thus, if non-filing Movants attempt to file individually the claims\n\nasserted in the First and Second Complaints-in-Intervention, the effort may be futile and their\n\nclaim would be subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. This\n\nimpairment would not be due to the disposition of this action, however, but to the Movants own\n\naction or inaction and therefore is not the type of impairment that Rule 24(a) was intended to\n\nprotect against.

The five non-filing Movants, however,\n\nwould be no more entitled to vicarious exhaustion than the non-filing plaintiffs, for whom\n\nvicarious exhaustion is not available due to the disparate nature of their legal and factual claims,\n\nas discussed in section IV. A. 3, supra. Their divergent factual allegations make amply clear that\n\nthe EEOC could not have had notice of the Movants’ claims based upon the EEOC charges filed\n\nby the three plaintiffs who exhausted their administrative remedies. Thus, the Movants would\n\nnot be able to rely upon the “single-filing” rule to assert their claims. Accord Kifafi v. Hilton\n\nHotel Ret.

Permissive Intervention Would Not Be Warranted\n       As an alternative ground, the Movants contend that the Court should exercise its broad\n\ndiscretion for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(2) and grant their motions to intervene.\n\nEven if the motions to intervene were not moot, the Court would decline to allow permissive\n\nintervention. For permissive intervention, the Movants must show that they share with the main\n\naction a common question of law or fact, and the Court “must consider whether the intervention\n\nwill unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.” FED. R. CIV. P.\n\n24(b)(1)(B) & (3). The Movants would satisfy neither of these requisite showings.\n\n                                            Page 91 of 94\n\f       The Movants acknowledge the differences in the factual allegations among each of the\n\nMovants and the plaintiffs, stating that the claims of each “present[] their unique experience.”\n\nMovants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 29, at 2; Movants’ Reply Mem., ECF No. 26, at 2.\n\nNonetheless, the Movants contend that these conceded differences militate in favor, not against,\n\nintervention because together each “plaintiff and/or intervenor adds a piece to a complex puzzle”\n\nthat “portray[s] a hostile work environment.” Id. The Court disagrees.\n\n       Close examination of the Movants’ claims make clear that they do not sufficiently share\n\ncommon questions of law or fact in common with each other or the main action that these claims\n\ncould be efficiently considered together. Other courts have similarly denied intervention in\n\ndiscrimination cases for failure to show a common question of law or fact “where they allege\n\ndisparate treatment claims that are unique to each individual complainant.” Jones, 2004 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 17981, at *32 (citing Seils v.

The Movants’\n\nclaims largely relate to different CFSA units, different supervisors, different allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory and retaliatory actions, and different adverse actions than the plaintiffs. For\n\nexample, while all of the plaintiffs complain about their treatment in the CPS component of\n\nCFSA, six of the Movants allege discriminatory treatment by other units, including In-Home and\n\nReunification Services, the Licensing & Monitoring Division and the Family Stabilization\n\nBranch. See Bergman v. Snow, No. 06-303, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">109274</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2-3 (D.D.C.\n\n\n\n                                            Page 92 of 94\n\fJuly 10, 2008) (motion to intervene in disability discrimination suit denied as having “no merit”\n\nwhere movant claimed to “suffer from similar psychiatric disorders” as plaintiff but worked in\n\n“entirely different parts of the Agency”). The three Movants who did work in CPS complain\n\nabout entirely different actions than the plaintiffs. Outlined below are several examples:\n\n           •   Movant Ivey describes her alleged observations of African caseworkers being\n               warned not to submit overtime payments, but this is simply not a central claim\n               made by any plaintiff.\n\n           •   Movant Lahai complains about being completely overwhelmed by her workload\n               in 2008 after the Jacks tragedy, but unlike the plaintiffs who complained that they\n               were penalized with poor work evaluations for their backlogs, Lahai claims she\n               was given nothing to do and then was transferred to another unit.\n\n           •   Movant Mickens-Lewis describes the demand from the CPS Deputy Director,\n               Supervisor I, to terminate an African caseworker due to a complaint from a family\n               he was investigating, but she nowhere alleges that the termination request was due\n               to a discriminatory or retaliatory reason. Unlike the plaintiffs’ claims of\n               retaliation for engaging in protected activity, Mickens-Lewis’ claim that she was\n               terminated for not complying with Supervisor I’s instructions to fire a caseworker\n               who was the subject of a complaint, does not appear to involve any allegation of\n               underlying discrimination against her or retaliation for engaging in protected\n               activity.\n       The differences in each Movant and plaintiff’s experiences would unduly complicate and\n\nconfuse the circumstances that apply to each party. For example, the Movants complain about\n\nSupervisors K through T, wholly different supervisors than A through J, whose actions are the\n\nsource of the plaintiffs’ complaints. In total, at least twenty different supervisors at various\n\nmanagement levels in various CFSA components are alleged to have engaged in discriminatory\n\nor retaliatory actions against different Movants and the plaintiffs. Keeping track of which\n\nsupervisor took an allegedly illegal action against a particular plaintiff or Movant would lead to\n\nunnecessary confusion.\n\n       The differences in the nature of the alleged actions underlying different legal claims\n\nwould also raise a significant risk of engendering potential prejudice not only to the defendant\n\n\n                                            Page 93 of 94\n\fbut also to the claims of the Movants or plaintiffs. For example, certain Movants, such as\n\nMonono and Mbadiugha, claim age discrimination, even though other Movants (e.g., Ivey and\n\nLahai) and plaintiffs (e.g., McCall and Meade), who are older than Monono and Mbadiugha, do\n\nnot assert claims for age discrimination. In addition, certain Movants, such as Ivey, describe\n\nallegedly discriminatory actions taken against other CFSA employees but not against her\n\npersonally, while other Movants claim denial of overtime pay and other allegedly adverse actions\n\ntaken against them. As the defendant accurately points out, “[a]llowing movants to intervene in\n\nthis suit will expand the scope of the issues . . . and delay the current proceeding.” Def. Opp’n to\n\nSecond Mot. at 4.\n\n       Accordingly, even if these motions were not moot, the Court would deny the Movants’\n\nmotions to intervene of right or permissively.\n\nVI.    CONCLUSION\n       For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended\n\nComplaint will be GRANTED, and the plaintiffs’ two pending Motions to Intervene will be\n\nDENIED. This case will be dismissed.\n\n       A separate order consistent with these findings and conclusions of law shall accompany\n\nthis Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\nDATED: April 16, 2012\n                                                             /s/ Beryl A.
