It is also noted that\nit has not been the poliog of the University to admit negroea as\nstudents and that   this Is probably the firs'tinstance in which a\nnegro has presented himself for registrat,ion  as a student.\n          In this opinion, it has been assumed that the applioation\nwas made in good faith,and the question presented has been determined\non a considerationof (1) the law of Texas regarding the separation\nof races in institutionsof higher learningand (2) a consideration\n\fHonorable T:S.
