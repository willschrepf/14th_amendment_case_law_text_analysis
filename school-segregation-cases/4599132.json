It is also noted that\nit has not been the poliog of the University to admit negroea as\nstudents and that   this Is probably the firs'tinstance in which a\nnegro has presented himself for registrat,ion  as a student.\n          In this opinion, it has been assumed that the applioation\nwas made in good faith,and the question presented has been determined\non a considerationof (1) the law of Texas regarding the separation\nof races in institutionsof higher learningand (2) a consideration\n\fHonorable T:S.

The State has a constitutionalright to furnish equal\nfacilities in separate sohools If it so desires and If the State\nhas made provision for such faoilities for negroes and has plaoed\na mandatory duty upon any of its officers,the applicant is not\ndeprived of any oonstitutionalright until applioationhas first\nbeen made to the proper authoritiesand the applioant~s rights\nhave been unlawfullyrefused (see Gsines v.
