Plaintiff Kevin Murray appeals a judgment in favor of\nDefendants United States Department of Treasury (“Treasury Department”) and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board of Governors”) on his\nEstablishment Clause Claim. Plaintiff alleges that the Treasury Department violated the\nFirst Amendment’s Establishment Clause by committing federal dollars to American\nInternational Group, Inc. (“AIG”), whose subsidiaries market and sell Sharia-compliant\nfinancing products. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants\non the merits. We AFFIRM the district court’s judgment, though on the alternative\nground that Plaintiff lacks standing.\n\n                                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n         Before Defendants obtained a controlling stake in AIG following the 2008\nfinancial crisis, certain AIG subsidiaries began selling Sharia-compliant financing\n(“SCF”) products. The term “Sharia” refers to Islamic law based on the teachings of the\nQuran.1 It is the Islamic code embodying the way of life for Muslims and is intended\nto serve as the civic law in Muslim countries. SCF insurance and financial products are\ndesigned to comply with Sharia law. For example, managers of an SCF product use a\nportion of the product’s reserves to fulfill the Islamic duty of charitable giving and do\nnot invest premiums in industries dealing with pork, alcohol, interest, gambling, or\npornography.2 AIG subsidiaries ensure the Sharia-compliance of its SCF products by\n\n\n\n         1\n          “Sharia” may be spelled “Sharia,” “Shariah,” “Shari’a,” and “Shari'ah,” but we adopt the spelling\n“Sharia” for purposes of this opinion.\n         2\n          By way of example, one SCF product is the “Takaful Homeowners Policy” marketed by AIG\nsubsidiary Lexington Life Insurance Company. “Takaful” is an Islamic insurance concept; a Sharia\nadherent may buy a Takaful policy, such as one sold by an AIG subsidiary, because it segregates\npolicyholder contributions and assets held by the policy-issuing subsidiary, invests no money in any\nventure prohibited by Sharia, disburses a share of any net surplus derived from premiums to charitable\norganizations, and prohibits the use of policyholder funds to enter into financial transactions prohibited\nby Sharia law.\n\fNo. 11-1063           Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                         Page 3\n\n\nobtaining consultation from “Sharia Supervisory Committees.” The members of these\ncommittees are authorities in Sharia law and oversee the implementation of SCF\nproducts by reviewing AIG’s operations, supervising the development of SCF products,\nand evaluating the compliance of these products with Sharia law.\n\n         AIG is a holding company for roughly 290 direct and indirect subsidiaries around\nthe world. All of AIG’s subsidiaries retain corporate formalities separate from AIG.\nAIG’s financial statements are consolidated among AIG, its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nand a proportional share of the net incomes of subsidiaries significantly controlled by\nAIG. The six AIG subsidiaries at issue in this case are consolidated in AIG’s financial\nstatements.3 AIG’s subsidiaries received a significant portion of the funds AIG received\nfrom the federal government. Six AIG subsidiaries have marketed and sold SCF\nproducts since AIG began receiving capital injections from the federal government, but\nAIG itself has not.\n\n         Defendant Treasury Department obtained its stake in AIG in a two-phase\nprocess. First, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) lent AIG $85 billion\nin September 2008. In exchange, AIG issued shares that were held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Treasury Department. Second, the Treasury Department took a partial\nownership stake in AIG by committing $40 billion pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief\nProgram (“TARP”). The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”), 12\nU.S.C. §§ 5201–61, gave the Treasury Secretary the power “to establish [TARP] to\npurchase, and to make and fund commitments to purchase, troubled assets from any\nfinancial institution, on such terms and conditions” set by him. 12 U.S.C. § 5211(a)(1).\nThe EESA defines a “troubled asset” as a “financial instrument . . . the purchase of\nwhich is necessary to promote financial market stability.” 12 U.S.C. § 5202(9)(B). It\nrequires the Treasury Secretary to exercise his authority under TARP only after\nconsidering several goals, such as protecting taxpayer interests, providing market\nstability in order to protect American jobs and savings, and ensuring the eligibility of all\n\n         3\n          Those AIG subsidiaries are Lexington Insurance Company; A.I. Risk Specialists Insurance, Inc.;\nChartis Takaful-Enaya B.S.C. (c); the Saudi Arabia branch office of American Life Insurance Company;\nAIA Takaful International, Bhd.; and PT. AIA Financial.\n\fNo. 11-1063        Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                Page 4\n\n\nfinancial institutions regardless of size or type. 12 U.S.C. § 5213. In November 2008,\nthe Treasury Secretary used his TARP authority to buy $40 billion worth of AIG\npreferred stock. Then, prompted by AIG’s significant losses in the fourth quarter of\n2008, the Treasury Department made another capital commitment to AIG in April 2009,\nthis time in the amount of $30 billion, in exchange for more shares of AIG preferred\nstock. In September 2010, AIG, the Treasury Department, the FRBNY, and other parties\nannounced their intention to enter into a series of agreements aimed at recapitalizing\nAIG, repaying taxpayer funds, and returning AIG to financial independence.\n\n       In December 2008, Plaintiff lodged an as-applied challenge to the EESA, arguing\nthat it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment for the government to\nallow a portion of the capital commitment given to AIG to support the marketing of SCF\nproducts. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction prohibiting\nDefendants from using taxpayer funds to support the sale of SCF products. According\nto Plaintiff, SCF products are a form of religious indoctrination, and he contends that the\nTreasury Department actively promoted the marketing of SCF products in addition to\nfunding AIG subsidiaries that marketed them. Neither party disputes that Treasury\nDepartment financing supported all of AIG’s business, including the subsidiaries that\nmarketed SCF products. Plaintiff contends that AIG disbursed $153 million to two\nsubsidiaries that marketed and sold SCF products, though Defendants dispute whether\nEESA funds were used for those disbursements.\n\n       Plaintiff is a Michigan resident, a Marine veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom,\na devout Catholic, and a federal taxpayer. His status as a federal taxpayer is the sole\nbasis of his asserted standing to challenge the EESA’s application. Plaintiff alleges that\nDefendants’ support of AIG harms him by supporting the sale of SCF products. The sale\nof SCF products allegedly harms him by promoting Sharia law, which his complaint\ncontends “forms the basis for the global jihadist war against the West and the United\nStates” and “sends a message to Plaintiff, who is a non-adherent to Islam, that he is an\noutsider.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 15, R. 45.)\n\fNo. 11-1063         Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                 Page 5\n\n\n        Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff lacked\nstanding and failed to state a claim, but the district court denied the motion. The parties\ncompleted discovery and filed cross-motions for summary judgment in June 2010.\nConcluding that the Treasury Department’s disbursements to AIG did not violate the\nEstablishment Clause, the district court denied Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment\nand granted that of Defendants.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n        On appeal, Defendants re-assert their challenge to Plaintiff’s standing, and that\nchallenge is well-taken. Recent cases from the Supreme Court and this Circuit make it\nclear that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this Establishment Clause challenge.\n\n        We review a district court’s decision regarding a plaintiff’s Article III standing\nde novo. Schultz v. United States, 529 F.3d 343, 349 (6th Cir. 2008). We look to the\ncomplaint and any accompanying materials in deciding standing questions. Pedreira v.\nKy. Baptist Homes for Children, Inc., 579 F.3d 722, 729 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n        Article III of the Constitution gives federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over\nactual cases or controversies, neither of which exists unless a plaintiff establishes his\nstanding to sue. ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 613 (1989); Allen v. Wright,\n468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984); see U.S. Const. art. III § 2. Because federal courts “sit ‘solely\n. . . to decide on the rights of individuals,’” Hein v. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc.,\n551 U.S. 587, 598 (2007) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803)),\nstanding is “the threshold question in every federal case.” Coyne v. Am. Tobacco Co.,\n183 F.3d 488, 494 (6th Cir. 1999) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975)).\nThe “well established” law of Article III standing requires a plaintiff to “allege personal\ninjury fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be\nredressed by the requested relief.” Hein, 551 U.S. at 598 (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at\n751).\n\n        Our inquiry into a plaintiff’s standing is “especially important” where the\nplaintiff contests the constitutionality of a generally applicable statute allegedly causing\n\fNo. 11-1063         Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                 Page 6\n\n\nhim “injury . . . not distinct from that suffered in general by other taxpayers or citizens.”\nId. (quoting ASARCO, 490 U.S. at 613). A plaintiff’s status as a federal taxpayer\ngenerally “does not give rise to the kind of redressable ‘personal injury’ required for\nArticle III standing,” id. at 599, and indeed taxpayer standing has been\n“long-disfavored” as a basis for federal jurisdiction over a challenge to a federal\nappropriation. Am. Atheists, Inc. v. City of Detroit Downtown Dev. Auth., 567 F.3d 278,\n284 (6th Cir. 2009). The reason for the disfavor lies in the proposition that a taxpayer’s\ninterest in the disbursement of federal appropriations is “too generalized and attenuated”\nto establish a “particularized injury” to the taxpayer-plaintiff. Hein, 551 U.S. at\n599–600; see Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923) (describing the injury\nsuffered by a federal taxpayer as a result of government spending as “comparatively\nminute and indeterminable”).\n\n        The Supreme Court recognized a “narrow exception” to the prohibition on\ntaxpayer standing in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968). In Flast, the taxpayer-plaintiffs\nraised an Establishment Clause challenge to the disbursement of funds to religious\nschools under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, citing their status\nas taxpayers as the sole basis for their standing. Id. at 85–86. In concluding that the\ntaxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to challenge the disbursements, the Court used a\ntwo-part test:\n\n        First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and\n        the type of legislative enactment attacked. Thus, a taxpayer will be a\n        proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of\n        congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, [§]\n        8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental\n        expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory\n        statute. . . . Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that\n        status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\n        Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged\n        enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the\n        exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply\n        that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress\n        by Art. I, [§] 8.\n\fNo. 11-1063         Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                 Page 7\n\n\nId. at 102–03 (emphasis added). The taxpayer-plaintiffs in Flast satisfied the first\ncondition by challenging a congressional spending statute adopted pursuant to Article\nI, § 8, of the Constitution. Id. at 103. They satisfied the second condition by alleging\nthat the disbursements violated the Establishment Clause, which “operates as a specific\nconstitutional limitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing and spending power\nconferred by Art. I, [§] 8.” Id. at 104.\n\n        The Supreme Court again concluded that taxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to\nassert an Establishment Clause challenge to a congressional appropriation in Bowen v.\nKendrick, 487 U.S. 589 (1988). In Kendrick, the taxpayer-plaintiffs challenged certain\nappropriations made pursuant to the Adolescent Family Life Act (“AFLA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 300z–z-10, and disbursed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Id. at\n593–94. The AFLA provided grants to public and non-profit organizations to fund\nprograms aimed at reducing the rate of unmarried adolescent pregnancy, and Congress\nexpressly directed that program disbursements should “make use of support systems\nsuch as . . . . religious and charitable organizations.” Id. at 596 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300z-2). The Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs demonstrated a nexus\nbetween their taxpayer status and Congress’s exercise of its taxing and spending power,\nreasoning that the taxpayer-plaintiffs’ claims “call[ed] into question how the funds\nauthorized by Congress are being disbursed pursuant to the AFLA’s statutory mandate.”\nId. at 620.\n\n        The Supreme Court clarified the requirements for taxpayer standing in Hein v.\nFreedom from Religion Foundation, Inc. In Hein, taxpayer-plaintiffs challenged\nexecutive orders establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community\nInitiatives within the Executive Office of the President, as well as similar offices in other\nfederal agencies, arguing that they violated the Establishment Clause. Hein, 551 U.S.\nat 593–94 (Alito, J., plurality opinion). Congress did not authorize the creation of the\noffices with legislation; rather, the offices were created by executive orders and funded\nby “general Executive Branch appropriations.” Id. at 595.\n\fNo. 11-1063            Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                          Page 8\n\n\n         The Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the\nexecutive orders. Id. at 608–09. According to the Court, in order to obtain standing,\ntaxpayer-plaintiffs must demonstrate their standing by alleging an “Establishment Clause\nviolation . . . funded by a specific congressional appropriation and . . . undertaken\npursuant to an express congressional mandate.” Id. at 604. The taxpayer-plaintiffs’\nchallenge in Hein was directed instead toward a different kind of government action, the\nCourt explained: the challenged “appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or\neven mention the expenditures of which respondents complain”; rather, “[t]hose\nexpenditures resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.” Id. at 605.\nBecause the taxpayer-plaintiffs challenged a disbursement not “funded by a specific\ncongressional appropriation” and not “undertaken pursuant to an express congressional\nmandate,” the Court concluded the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing.4 Id. at 604.\n\n         Two portions of Hein are noteworthy. First, the Hein Court recast the factual\nunderpinning of Flast.            The legislation at issue in Flast expressly permitted\ndisbursements to private schools but made no specific reference to disbursement to\nreligious schools. See id. at 604. The Court noted, however, that “the great majority of\nnonpublic elementary and secondary schools in the United States were associated with\na church” at the time of Flast. Id. at 604 n.3. That fact led the Court to conclude that\n“Congress surely understood that much of the aid mandated by the statute would find its\nway to religious schools.” Id. Thus, while the Hein Court explained that “the Flast\nexception has largely been confined to its facts” in the decades since it was decided,\nHein’s analysis of those facts was arguably different than that of the Flast Court itself.\nId. at 609.\n\n         Second, in surveying Kendrick, the Court emphasized the fact that the AFLA’s\ntext raised the possibility that AFLA funds could be disbursed to religious groups.\nNoting that the AFLA expressly referred to religious organizations as possible recipients\n\n\n         4\n           Justices Scalia and Thomas concurred separately from the four-Justice plurality and argued that\nthe Court should overrule Flast. See Hein, 551 U.S. at 618 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The\nplurality opinion’s narrower basis for concluding that the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing controls our\ndecision. See City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ’g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 764 n.9 (1988).\n\fNo. 11-1063             Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                            Page 9\n\n\nof federal funding, the Hein Court repeated Kendrick’s conclusion that the “claims\n‘called into question how the funds authorized by Congress were being disbursed\npursuant to the AFLA’s statutory mandate.’” Id. at 607 (quoting Kendrick, 487 U.S. at\n619–20) (emphasis in Hein). The Hein Court described Kendrick as “involv[ing] a\n‘program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress’ taxing and spending powers’\nthat ‘Congress had created,’ ‘authorized,’ and ‘mandated.’” Id. (quoting Kendrick, 487\nU.S. at 619–20).\n\n         In these two portions of Hein, the Supreme Court expressly linked the\nappropriations at issue in Flast and Kendrick to congressional intention that the funds\nwould be disbursed to religious groups. In so doing, the Hein Court indicated that a\ntaxpayer-plaintiff had standing to raise an Establishment Clause challenge to an\nexecutive branch disbursement only where the statute “expressly contemplate[s] that\nsome of those moneys might go to projects involving religious groups.”5 Id.\n\n         Our application of Hein has been consistent with this requirement. In Pedreira\nv. Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children, Inc., taxpayer-plaintiffs alleged that two\nKentucky cabinet secretaries violated the Establishment Clause by disbursing Social\nSecurity funds to a Baptist ministry. Pedreira, 579 F.3d at 724–25, 730; see 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 670-679b, 1381-1383f. The statutory scheme at issue authorized state officials “to\nprovide foster care and maintenance for children.” Pedreira, 579 F.3d at 730. We\ndescribed the provisions authorizing the disbursements as “general funding provisions\nfor childcare” that did “not contemplate religious indoctrination.” Id. at 731. We\nconcluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing to raise their Establishment Clause\nchallenge, reasoning that the taxpayer-plaintiffs “failed to explain how these programs\nare related to the alleged constitutional violation.” Id. at 730–31. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n         5\n          A potential source of confusion lies in the fact that the Hein Court claimed to “leave Flast as [the\nCourt] found it.” Id. at 615 (“We do not extend Flast, but we also do not overrule it. We leave Flast as\nwe found it.”). Whether or not Hein contains a literal reading of Flast, Hein’s construction of Flast—in\nother words, the scope of taxpayer standing the Hein court “found” Flast to have fixed—is binding on\nlower courts. See Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ky. v. McCreary Cty., Ky., 607 F.3d 439, 447 (6th Cir.\n2010) (“Lower courts are ‘obligated to follow Supreme Court dicta, particularly where there is not\nsubstantial reason for disregarding it, such as age or subsequent statements undermining its rationale.’”\n(quoting United States v. Marlow, 278 F.3d 581, 588 n.7 (6th Cir. 2002)).\n\fNo. 11-1063        Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 10\n\n\nplaintiffs’ claims were “too attenuated to form a sufficient nexus between the legislation\nand the alleged violations.” Id. at 731.\n\n       We expressed the same understanding of Hein in American Atheists, Inc. v. City\nof Detroit Downtown Development Authority.             In the course of evaluating an\nEstablishment Clause challenge to a municipal grant program, we stated that Hein\n“explained that the Flast exception does not extend to suits challenging executive-branch\nexpenditures of unearmarked funds.” Am. Atheists, 567 F.3d at 286. Though this\nstatement was not essential to our disposition in American Atheists, it reflects our\nunderstanding that a taxpayer-plaintiff has standing to challenge an executive-branch\ndisbursement of funds only if the appropriating statute expressly contemplates the\ndisbursement of federal funds to support religious groups or activities.\n\n       The     EESA does not contemplate the disbursement of congressional\nappropriations to support religious activities. Congress articulated the following goals\nin adopting the EESA:\n\n       to immediately provide authority and facilities that the Secretary of the\n       Treasury can use to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system\n       of the United States . . . in a manner that (A) protects home values,\n       college funds, retirement accounts, and life savings; (B) preserves\n       homeownership and promotes jobs and economic growth; (C) maximizes\n       overall returns to the taxpayers of the United States; and (D) provides\n       public accountability for the exercise of such authority.\n\n12 U.S.C. § 5201. The EESA aims to accomplish these goals by giving the Treasury\nSecretary authority to create TARP, which allows him “to purchase, and to make and\nfund commitments to purchase, troubled assets from any financial institution.”\n12 U.S.C. § 5211(a)(1). The EESA requires the Treasury Secretary to take several goals\ninto consideration when he administers TARP, including “protecting the interests of\ntaxpayers,” “providing stability and preventing disruption to financial markets in order\nto limit the impact on the economy and protect American jobs, savings, and retirement\nsecurity,” and “ensuring that all financial institutions are eligible to participate in the\nprogram.” 12 U.S.C. § 5213.\n\fNo. 11-1063        Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 11\n\n\n       Nothing about these stated goals, nor any other portion of the EESA that Plaintiff\nbrings to our attention, “expressly contemplate[s] that some [federal funding] might go\nto projects involving religious groups,” or otherwise indicates Congress’ expectation that\nTARP funds would support religious programs. Hein, 551 U.S. at 607. Without any\nsuch indication, Plaintiff stands in the same position as the taxpayer-plaintiffs in Hein,\nwho challenged “expenditures result[ing] from executive discretion, not congressional\naction.” Id. at 605.\n\n       Attempting to convince us that the EESA contemplates support for religious\nactivities, Plaintiff contends that Congress expected the Treasury Secretary to use TARP\nfunds to fund the sale of SCF products. See id. at 604 n.3 (noting that “the great majority\nof nonpublic elementary and secondary schools in the United States were associated with\na church” at the time of Flast and concluding that “Congress surely understood that\nmuch of the aid mandated by the statute would find its way to religious schools”).\nPlaintiff offers evidence of several activities undertaken by government policymakers\naimed at familiarizing themselves with Islamic finance. For example, in December\n2008, shortly after the Treasury Department acquired an interest in AIG, the department\nsponsored a conference entitled “Islamic Finance 101.” The stated purpose of the\nconference was to provide government policymakers information about Islamic finance.\nThe presentation materials from the conference discussed topics such as the source of\nIslamic finance, how Islamic finance works, and the market factors that caused its\ngrowth. On the basis of activities such as “Islamic Finance 101,” Plaintiff invites us to\nadopt the “reasonable inference” that Congress knew EESA appropriations “would\nsupport AIG’s operations, including its religious activities[,] since AIG was well known\nas the leader in SCF.” (Reply Br. 14.)\n\n       We find no basis for accepting that invitation. Plaintiff’s evidence—a few\nscattered bureaucratic activities intended to inform policymakers about a subject relevant\nto their regulatory responsibilities that happened to have a religious nexus—is\nunconvincing, to say the least. It falls well short of supporting a reasonable inference\nof congressional intention that a portion of the EESA’s vast appropriations might support\n\fNo. 11-1063        Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 12\n\n\nthe marketing of a minor portion of the business of AIG subsidiaries. Plaintiff has failed\nto demonstrate that Congress “understood that much of the aid mandated by the [EESA]\nwould find its way” to fund SCF products. Hein, 551 U.S. at 604 n.3.\n\n       Plaintiff also argues that the as-applied posture of his challenge to the EESA\ngives him standing, but the posture of his challenge is irrelevant to our standing inquiry.\nAccording to Plaintiff, he does not challenge the EESA, per se, but rather the Treasury\nSecretary’s decision to disburse EESA funds to businesses that may have used the\nmoney to support the marketing and sale of SCF products. That disbursement, in\nPlaintiff’s opinion, provides the nexus between his status as a taxpayer and an alleged\nEstablishment Clause violation.\n\n       Hein squarely prohibits this argument.         There, the general congressional\nappropriations that funded the executive orders subject to the Establishment Clause\nchallenge did not indicate a congressional understanding that the money might be used\nfor a religious purpose. Hein, 551 U.S. at 593–94. It was only through “executive\ndiscretion” that the congressional appropriations were used for arguably religious\npurposes. Id. at 605. The taxpayer-plaintiff lacked standing under those circumstances,\nwhich were identical in all relevant respects to those presented by Plaintiff’s challenge\nto the EESA. Neither the EESA nor any reasonable inference from its historical context\nsuggest that Congress knew, or much less intended, that TARP funds might support the\nmarketing and sales of SCF products. It was only through executive discretion that\nTARP funds were transferred to AIG and, in turn, its subsidiaries. Because the EESA\ndoes not contemplate the use of federal funds to support religious activities, Plaintiff\nlacks standing.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment on a\nseparate basis supported by the record.

Plaintiff Kevin Murray appeals a judgment in favor of\nDefendants United States Department of Treasury (“Treasury Department”) and the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board of Governors”) on his\nEstablishment Clause Claim. Plaintiff alleges that the Treasury Department violated the\nFirst Amendment’s Establishment Clause by committing federal dollars to American\nInternational Group, Inc. (“AIG”), whose subsidiaries market and sell Sharia-compliant\nfinancing products. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants\non the merits. We AFFIRM the district court’s judgment, though on the alternative\nground that Plaintiff lacks standing.\n\n                                  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n         Before Defendants obtained a controlling stake in AIG following the 2008\nfinancial crisis, certain AIG subsidiaries began selling Sharia-compliant financing\n(“SCF”) products. The term “Sharia” refers to Islamic law based on the teachings of the\nQuran.1 It is the Islamic code embodying the way of life for Muslims and is intended\nto serve as the civic law in Muslim countries. SCF insurance and financial products are\ndesigned to comply with Sharia law. For example, managers of an SCF product use a\nportion of the product’s reserves to fulfill the Islamic duty of charitable giving and do\nnot invest premiums in industries dealing with pork, alcohol, interest, gambling, or\npornography.2 AIG subsidiaries ensure the Sharia-compliance of its SCF products by\n\n\n\n         1\n          “Sharia” may be spelled “Sharia,” “Shariah,” “Shari’a,” and “Shari'ah,” but we adopt the spelling\n“Sharia” for purposes of this opinion.\n         2\n          By way of example, one SCF product is the “Takaful Homeowners Policy” marketed by AIG\nsubsidiary Lexington Life Insurance Company. “Takaful” is an Islamic insurance concept; a Sharia\nadherent may buy a Takaful policy, such as one sold by an AIG subsidiary, because it segregates\npolicyholder contributions and assets held by the policy-issuing subsidiary, invests no money in any\nventure prohibited by Sharia, disburses a share of any net surplus derived from premiums to charitable\norganizations, and prohibits the use of policyholder funds to enter into financial transactions prohibited\nby Sharia law.\n\fNo. 11-1063           Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                         Page 3\n\n\nobtaining consultation from “Sharia Supervisory Committees.” The members of these\ncommittees are authorities in Sharia law and oversee the implementation of SCF\nproducts by reviewing AIG’s operations, supervising the development of SCF products,\nand evaluating the compliance of these products with Sharia law.\n\n         AIG is a holding company for roughly 290 direct and indirect subsidiaries around\nthe world. All of AIG’s subsidiaries retain corporate formalities separate from AIG.\nAIG’s financial statements are consolidated among AIG, its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nand a proportional share of the net incomes of subsidiaries significantly controlled by\nAIG. The six AIG subsidiaries at issue in this case are consolidated in AIG’s financial\nstatements.3 AIG’s subsidiaries received a significant portion of the funds AIG received\nfrom the federal government. Six AIG subsidiaries have marketed and sold SCF\nproducts since AIG began receiving capital injections from the federal government, but\nAIG itself has not.\n\n         Defendant Treasury Department obtained its stake in AIG in a two-phase\nprocess. First, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) lent AIG $85 billion\nin September 2008. In exchange, AIG issued shares that were held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Treasury Department. Second, the Treasury Department took a partial\nownership stake in AIG by committing $40 billion pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief\nProgram (“TARP”). The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”), 12\nU.S.C. §§ 5201–61, gave the Treasury Secretary the power “to establish [TARP] to\npurchase, and to make and fund commitments to purchase, troubled assets from any\nfinancial institution, on such terms and conditions” set by him. 12 U.S.C. § 5211(a)(1).\nThe EESA defines a “troubled asset” as a “financial instrument . . . the purchase of\nwhich is necessary to promote financial market stability.” 12 U.S.C. § 5202(9)(B). It\nrequires the Treasury Secretary to exercise his authority under TARP only after\nconsidering several goals, such as protecting taxpayer interests, providing market\nstability in order to protect American jobs and savings, and ensuring the eligibility of all\n\n         3\n          Those AIG subsidiaries are Lexington Insurance Company; A.I. Risk Specialists Insurance, Inc.;\nChartis Takaful-Enaya B.S.C. (c); the Saudi Arabia branch office of American Life Insurance Company;\nAIA Takaful International, Bhd.; and PT. AIA Financial.\n\fNo. 11-1063        Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                Page 4\n\n\nfinancial institutions regardless of size or type. 12 U.S.C. § 5213. In November 2008,\nthe Treasury Secretary used his TARP authority to buy $40 billion worth of AIG\npreferred stock. Then, prompted by AIG’s significant losses in the fourth quarter of\n2008, the Treasury Department made another capital commitment to AIG in April 2009,\nthis time in the amount of $30 billion, in exchange for more shares of AIG preferred\nstock. In September 2010, AIG, the Treasury Department, the FRBNY, and other parties\nannounced their intention to enter into a series of agreements aimed at recapitalizing\nAIG, repaying taxpayer funds, and returning AIG to financial independence.\n\n       In December 2008, Plaintiff lodged an as-applied challenge to the EESA, arguing\nthat it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment for the government to\nallow a portion of the capital commitment given to AIG to support the marketing of SCF\nproducts. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction prohibiting\nDefendants from using taxpayer funds to support the sale of SCF products. According\nto Plaintiff, SCF products are a form of religious indoctrination, and he contends that the\nTreasury Department actively promoted the marketing of SCF products in addition to\nfunding AIG subsidiaries that marketed them. Neither party disputes that Treasury\nDepartment financing supported all of AIG’s business, including the subsidiaries that\nmarketed SCF products. Plaintiff contends that AIG disbursed $153 million to two\nsubsidiaries that marketed and sold SCF products, though Defendants dispute whether\nEESA funds were used for those disbursements.\n\n       Plaintiff is a Michigan resident, a Marine veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom,\na devout Catholic, and a federal taxpayer. His status as a federal taxpayer is the sole\nbasis of his asserted standing to challenge the EESA’s application. Plaintiff alleges that\nDefendants’ support of AIG harms him by supporting the sale of SCF products. The sale\nof SCF products allegedly harms him by promoting Sharia law, which his complaint\ncontends “forms the basis for the global jihadist war against the West and the United\nStates” and “sends a message to Plaintiff, who is a non-adherent to Islam, that he is an\noutsider.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 15, R. 45.)\n\fNo. 11-1063         Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                 Page 5\n\n\n        Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff lacked\nstanding and failed to state a claim, but the district court denied the motion. The parties\ncompleted discovery and filed cross-motions for summary judgment in June 2010.\nConcluding that the Treasury Department’s disbursements to AIG did not violate the\nEstablishment Clause, the district court denied Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment\nand granted that of Defendants.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n        On appeal, Defendants re-assert their challenge to Plaintiff’s standing, and that\nchallenge is well-taken. Recent cases from the Supreme Court and this Circuit make it\nclear that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this Establishment Clause challenge.\n\n        We review a district court’s decision regarding a plaintiff’s Article III standing\nde novo.

(quoting ASARCO, 490 U.S. at 613). A plaintiff’s status as a federal taxpayer\ngenerally “does not give rise to the kind of redressable ‘personal injury’ required for\nArticle III standing,” id. at 599, and indeed taxpayer standing has been\n“long-disfavored” as a basis for federal jurisdiction over a challenge to a federal\nappropriation. Am. Atheists, Inc. v. City of Detroit Downtown Dev.

The reason for the disfavor lies in the proposition that a taxpayer’s\ninterest in the disbursement of federal appropriations is “too generalized and attenuated”\nto establish a “particularized injury” to the taxpayer-plaintiff. Hein, 551 U.S. at\n599–600; see Frothingham v. Mellon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100240\"><a href=\"/opinion/100240/massachusetts-v-mellon/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1923) (describing the injury\nsuffered by a federal taxpayer as a result of government spending as “comparatively\nminute and indeterminable”).\n\n        The Supreme Court recognized a “narrow exception” to the prohibition on\ntaxpayer standing in Flast v. Cohen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107731\"><a href=\"/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968). In Flast, the taxpayer-plaintiffs\nraised an Establishment Clause challenge to the disbursement of funds to religious\nschools under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, citing their status\nas taxpayers as the sole basis for their standing. Id. at 85–86. In concluding that the\ntaxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to challenge the disbursements, the Court used a\ntwo-part test:\n\n        First, the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and\n        the type of legislative enactment attacked. Thus, a taxpayer will be a\n        proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of\n        congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, [§]\n        8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental\n        expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory\n        statute. . . . Secondly, the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that\n        status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\n        Under this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged\n        enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the\n        exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply\n        that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress\n        by Art. I, [§] 8.\n\fNo. 11-1063         Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                 Page 7\n\n\nId. at 102–03 (emphasis added). The taxpayer-plaintiffs in Flast satisfied the first\ncondition by challenging a congressional spending statute adopted pursuant to Article\nI, § 8, of the Constitution. Id. at 103. They satisfied the second condition by alleging\nthat the disbursements violated the Establishment Clause, which “operates as a specific\nconstitutional limitation upon the exercise by Congress of the taxing and spending power\nconferred by Art. I, [§] 8.” Id. at 104.\n\n        The Supreme Court again concluded that taxpayer-plaintiffs had standing to\nassert an Establishment Clause challenge to a congressional appropriation in Bowen v.\nKendrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112138\"><a href=\"/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988). In Kendrick, the taxpayer-plaintiffs challenged certain\nappropriations made pursuant to the Adolescent Family Life Act (“AFLA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 300z–z-10, and disbursed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Id. at\n593–94. The AFLA provided grants to public and non-profit organizations to fund\nprograms aimed at reducing the rate of unmarried adolescent pregnancy, and Congress\nexpressly directed that program disbursements should “make use of support systems\nsuch as . . . . religious and charitable organizations.” Id. at 596 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300z-2). The Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs demonstrated a nexus\nbetween their taxpayer status and Congress’s exercise of its taxing and spending power,\nreasoning that the taxpayer-plaintiffs’ claims “call[ed] into question how the funds\nauthorized by Congress are being disbursed pursuant to the AFLA’s statutory mandate.”\nId. at 620.\n\n        The Supreme Court clarified the requirements for taxpayer standing in Hein v.\nFreedom from Religion Foundation, Inc. In Hein, taxpayer-plaintiffs challenged\nexecutive orders establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community\nInitiatives within the Executive Office of the President, as well as similar offices in other\nfederal agencies, arguing that they violated the Establishment Clause. Hein, 551 U.S.\nat 593–94 (Alito, J., plurality opinion). Congress did not authorize the creation of the\noffices with legislation; rather, the offices were created by executive orders and funded\nby “general Executive Branch appropriations.” Id. at 595.\n\fNo. 11-1063            Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                          Page 8\n\n\n         The Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the\nexecutive orders. Id. at 608–09. According to the Court, in order to obtain standing,\ntaxpayer-plaintiffs must demonstrate their standing by alleging an “Establishment Clause\nviolation . . . funded by a specific congressional appropriation and . . . undertaken\npursuant to an express congressional mandate.” Id. at 604. The taxpayer-plaintiffs’\nchallenge in Hein was directed instead toward a different kind of government action, the\nCourt explained: the challenged “appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or\neven mention the expenditures of which respondents complain”; rather, “[t]hose\nexpenditures resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.” Id. at 605.\nBecause the taxpayer-plaintiffs challenged a disbursement not “funded by a specific\ncongressional appropriation” and not “undertaken pursuant to an express congressional\nmandate,” the Court concluded the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing.4 Id. at 604.\n\n         Two portions of Hein are noteworthy. First, the Hein Court recast the factual\nunderpinning of Flast.            The legislation at issue in Flast expressly permitted\ndisbursements to private schools but made no specific reference to disbursement to\nreligious schools. See id. at 604. The Court noted, however, that “the great majority of\nnonpublic elementary and secondary schools in the United States were associated with\na church” at the time of Flast. Id. at 604 n.3. That fact led the Court to conclude that\n“Congress surely understood that much of the aid mandated by the statute would find its\nway to religious schools.” Id. Thus, while the Hein Court explained that “the Flast\nexception has largely been confined to its facts” in the decades since it was decided,\nHein’s analysis of those facts was arguably different than that of the Flast Court itself.\nId. at 609.\n\n         Second, in surveying Kendrick, the Court emphasized the fact that the AFLA’s\ntext raised the possibility that AFLA funds could be disbursed to religious groups.\nNoting that the AFLA expressly referred to religious organizations as possible recipients\n\n\n         4\n           Justices Scalia and Thomas concurred separately from the four-Justice plurality and argued that\nthe Court should overrule Flast. See Hein, 551 U.S. at 618 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The\nplurality opinion’s narrower basis for concluding that the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing controls our\ndecision. See City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ’g Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112103\"><a href=\"/opinion/112103/city-of-lakewood-v-plain-dealer-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 n.9 (1988).\n\fNo. 11-1063             Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                            Page 9\n\n\nof federal funding, the Hein Court repeated Kendrick’s conclusion that the “claims\n‘called into question how the funds authorized by Congress were being disbursed\npursuant to the AFLA’s statutory mandate.’” Id. at 607 (quoting Kendrick, 487 U.S. at\n619–20) (emphasis in Hein). The Hein Court described Kendrick as “involv[ing] a\n‘program of disbursement of funds pursuant to Congress’ taxing and spending powers’\nthat ‘Congress had created,’ ‘authorized,’ and ‘mandated.’” Id. (quoting Kendrick, 487\nU.S. at 619–20).\n\n         In these two portions of Hein, the Supreme Court expressly linked the\nappropriations at issue in Flast and Kendrick to congressional intention that the funds\nwould be disbursed to religious groups. In so doing, the Hein Court indicated that a\ntaxpayer-plaintiff had standing to raise an Establishment Clause challenge to an\nexecutive branch disbursement only where the statute “expressly contemplate[s] that\nsome of those moneys might go to projects involving religious groups.”5 Id.\n\n         Our application of Hein has been consistent with this requirement. In Pedreira\nv. Kentucky Baptist Homes for Children, Inc., taxpayer-plaintiffs alleged that two\nKentucky cabinet secretaries violated the Establishment Clause by disbursing Social\nSecurity funds to a Baptist ministry. Pedreira, 579 F.3d at 724–25, 730; see 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 670-679b, 1381-1383f. The statutory scheme at issue authorized state officials “to\nprovide foster care and maintenance for children.” Pedreira, 579 F.3d at 730. We\ndescribed the provisions authorizing the disbursements as “general funding provisions\nfor childcare” that did “not contemplate religious indoctrination.” Id. at 731. We\nconcluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs lacked standing to raise their Establishment Clause\nchallenge, reasoning that the taxpayer-plaintiffs “failed to explain how these programs\nare related to the alleged constitutional violation.” Id. at 730–31. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n         5\n          A potential source of confusion lies in the fact that the Hein Court claimed to “leave Flast as [the\nCourt] found it.” Id. at 615 (“We do not extend Flast, but we also do not overrule it. We leave Flast as\nwe found it.”). Whether or not Hein contains a literal reading of Flast, Hein’s construction of Flast—in\nother words, the scope of taxpayer standing the Hein court “found” Flast to have fixed—is binding on\nlower courts.

McCreary Cty., Ky., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148165\"><a href=\"/opinion/148165/american-civil-liberties-union-v-mccreary-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (6th Cir.\n2010) (“Lower courts are ‘obligated to follow Supreme Court dicta, particularly where there is not\nsubstantial reason for disregarding it, such as age or subsequent statements undermining its rationale.’”\n(quoting United States v.

United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 10\n\n\nplaintiffs’ claims were “too attenuated to form a sufficient nexus between the legislation\nand the alleged violations.” Id. at 731.\n\n       We expressed the same understanding of Hein in American Atheists, Inc. v. City\nof Detroit Downtown Development Authority.             In the course of evaluating an\nEstablishment Clause challenge to a municipal grant program, we stated that Hein\n“explained that the Flast exception does not extend to suits challenging executive-branch\nexpenditures of unearmarked funds.” Am. Atheists, 567 F.3d at 286. Though this\nstatement was not essential to our disposition in American Atheists, it reflects our\nunderstanding that a taxpayer-plaintiff has standing to challenge an executive-branch\ndisbursement of funds only if the appropriating statute expressly contemplates the\ndisbursement of federal funds to support religious groups or activities.\n\n       The     EESA does not contemplate the disbursement of congressional\nappropriations to support religious activities. Congress articulated the following goals\nin adopting the EESA:\n\n       to immediately provide authority and facilities that the Secretary of the\n       Treasury can use to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system\n       of the United States . . . in a manner that (A) protects home values,\n       college funds, retirement accounts, and life savings; (B) preserves\n       homeownership and promotes jobs and economic growth; (C) maximizes\n       overall returns to the taxpayers of the United States; and (D) provides\n       public accountability for the exercise of such authority.\n\n12 U.S.C. § 5201. The EESA aims to accomplish these goals by giving the Treasury\nSecretary authority to create TARP, which allows him “to purchase, and to make and\nfund commitments to purchase, troubled assets from any financial institution.”\n12 U.S.C. § 5211(a)(1). The EESA requires the Treasury Secretary to take several goals\ninto consideration when he administers TARP, including “protecting the interests of\ntaxpayers,” “providing stability and preventing disruption to financial markets in order\nto limit the impact on the economy and protect American jobs, savings, and retirement\nsecurity,” and “ensuring that all financial institutions are eligible to participate in the\nprogram.” 12 U.S.C. § 5213.\n\fNo. 11-1063        Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 11\n\n\n       Nothing about these stated goals, nor any other portion of the EESA that Plaintiff\nbrings to our attention, “expressly contemplate[s] that some [federal funding] might go\nto projects involving religious groups,” or otherwise indicates Congress’ expectation that\nTARP funds would support religious programs. Hein, 551 U.S. at 607. Without any\nsuch indication, Plaintiff stands in the same position as the taxpayer-plaintiffs in Hein,\nwho challenged “expenditures result[ing] from executive discretion, not congressional\naction.” Id. at 605.\n\n       Attempting to convince us that the EESA contemplates support for religious\nactivities, Plaintiff contends that Congress expected the Treasury Secretary to use TARP\nfunds to fund the sale of SCF products. See id. at 604 n.3 (noting that “the great majority\nof nonpublic elementary and secondary schools in the United States were associated with\na church” at the time of Flast and concluding that “Congress surely understood that\nmuch of the aid mandated by the statute would find its way to religious schools”).\nPlaintiff offers evidence of several activities undertaken by government policymakers\naimed at familiarizing themselves with Islamic finance. For example, in December\n2008, shortly after the Treasury Department acquired an interest in AIG, the department\nsponsored a conference entitled “Islamic Finance 101.” The stated purpose of the\nconference was to provide government policymakers information about Islamic finance.\nThe presentation materials from the conference discussed topics such as the source of\nIslamic finance, how Islamic finance works, and the market factors that caused its\ngrowth. On the basis of activities such as “Islamic Finance 101,” Plaintiff invites us to\nadopt the “reasonable inference” that Congress knew EESA appropriations “would\nsupport AIG’s operations, including its religious activities[,] since AIG was well known\nas the leader in SCF.” (Reply Br. 14.)\n\n       We find no basis for accepting that invitation. Plaintiff’s evidence—a few\nscattered bureaucratic activities intended to inform policymakers about a subject relevant\nto their regulatory responsibilities that happened to have a religious nexus—is\nunconvincing, to say the least. It falls well short of supporting a reasonable inference\nof congressional intention that a portion of the EESA’s vast appropriations might support\n\fNo. 11-1063        Murray v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 12\n\n\nthe marketing of a minor portion of the business of AIG subsidiaries. Plaintiff has failed\nto demonstrate that Congress “understood that much of the aid mandated by the [EESA]\nwould find its way” to fund SCF products. Hein, 551 U.S. at 604 n.3.\n\n       Plaintiff also argues that the as-applied posture of his challenge to the EESA\ngives him standing, but the posture of his challenge is irrelevant to our standing inquiry.\nAccording to Plaintiff, he does not challenge the EESA, per se, but rather the Treasury\nSecretary’s decision to disburse EESA funds to businesses that may have used the\nmoney to support the marketing and sale of SCF products. That disbursement, in\nPlaintiff’s opinion, provides the nexus between his status as a taxpayer and an alleged\nEstablishment Clause violation.\n\n       Hein squarely prohibits this argument.         There, the general congressional\nappropriations that funded the executive orders subject to the Establishment Clause\nchallenge did not indicate a congressional understanding that the money might be used\nfor a religious purpose. Hein, 551 U.S. at 593–94. It was only through “executive\ndiscretion” that the congressional appropriations were used for arguably religious\npurposes. Id. at 605. The taxpayer-plaintiff lacked standing under those circumstances,\nwhich were identical in all relevant respects to those presented by Plaintiff’s challenge\nto the EESA. Neither the EESA nor any reasonable inference from its historical context\nsuggest that Congress knew, or much less intended, that TARP funds might support the\nmarketing and sales of SCF products. It was only through executive discretion that\nTARP funds were transferred to AIG and, in turn, its subsidiaries. Because the EESA\ndoes not contemplate the use of federal funds to support religious activities, Plaintiff\nlacks standing.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment on a\nseparate basis supported by the record.
