No. 4:11-CV-00457-JED-FHM)\n\n\nDaniel E. Smolen of Smolen, Smolen & Roytman, P.L.L.C., Tulsa, Oklahoma\n(Donald E. Smolen, II, of Smolen, Smolen & Roytman, P.L.L.C., Tulsa,\nOklahoma; Robert M. Blakemore, Louis W. Bullock, and Patricia W. Bullock of\nBullock Law Firm, Tulsa, Oklahoma, with him on the brief), for\nPlaintiff-Appellee.\n\nGuy A. Fortney of Brewster & De Angelis, P.L.L.C., Tulsa, Oklahoma (Clark O.\nBrewster and Corbin C. Brewster of Brewster & De Angelis, P.L.L.C., Tulsa,\nOklahoma, with him on the briefs), for Defendant-Appellant.\n\n\nBefore BRISCOE, Chief Judge, HOLMES and BACHARACH, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nHOLMES, Circuit Judge.\n\f      After Charles Jernegan committed suicide at the David L. Moss Criminal\n\nJustice Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma (“Jail”), his mother, Plaintiff-Appellee Carolyn\n\nCox, commenced this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against Defendant-Appellant\n\nStanley Glanz, the Tulsa County Sheriff (“Sheriff Glanz” or “the Sheriff”). Ms.\n\nCox sought to hold Sheriff Glanz liable for Mr. Jernegan’s suicide in his\n\nindividual capacity (relying upon a supervisory-liability theory) and in his official\n\ncapacity. Regarding both capacities, she alleged Eighth Amendment violations.\n\nSheriff Glanz moved for summary judgment, asserting the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity. The district court issued a ruling in which it denied the Sheriff’s\n\nmotion in all respects—albeit without mentioning qualified immunity—based on\n\nthe existence of genuinely disputed material facts.\n\n      In this interlocutory appeal, Sheriff Glanz contends that extant caselaw at\n\nthe time of Mr. Jernegan’s suicide did not clearly establish that he could be held\n\nliable as a supervisor under the circumstances present here—put succinctly, where\n\nMr. Jernegan denied having a suicidal intent during booking and no Jail staff\n\nmembers detected a basis for referring him for additional mental-health screening\n\nbased on their interactions with him. Accordingly, the Sheriff reasons that this\n\ndearth of clearly established law means that the district court erred in (tacitly)\n\ndenying him qualified immunity. The Sheriff also asserts that none of the\n\npolicies or procedures he has implemented at the Jail can be characterized as the\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fmoving force behind any alleged violation of Mr. Jernegan’s constitutional rights;\n\nconsequently, he says, there is no basis for official liability.\n\n         For ease of reference, we briefly summarize the conclusions of our ensuing\n\ndetailed analysis. First, we agree with Sheriff Glanz that reversal on Ms. Cox’s\n\nindividual-capacity claim is justified here and that the case must be remanded to\n\nthe district court. We specifically base our decision to reverse on our\n\ndetermination infra that the then-extant clearly established law would not have\n\nput a jail administrator similarly situated to Sheriff Glanz on notice that he could\n\nbe held liable under § 1983 for an Eighth Amendment violation based on a\n\nprisoner’s suicide where, as here, neither he nor any identified staff member\n\nwhom he supervised possessed knowledge that the particular inmate who\n\ncommitted suicide presented a substantial risk of taking his own life. Absent such\n\nknowledge, under then-extant clearly established law, the conduct of neither\n\nSheriff Glanz nor his identified subordinates with respect to a particular\n\nprisoner—here, Mr. Jernegan—could give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\nConsequently, Ms. Cox cannot perforce make the requisite showing under the\n\nclearly-established-law component of the well-settled qualified-immunity\n\nstandard. We thus reverse the district court’s summary-judgment decision\n\ndenying qualified immunity to Sheriff Glanz on Ms. Cox’s individual-capacity\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f      As for Ms. Cox’s official-capacity claim against Sheriff Glanz, however,\n\nwe confront the threshold issue of whether the exercise of our appellate\n\njurisdiction is proper. This is so because the district court’s denial of the motion\n\nfor summary judgment brought by the Sheriff in his official capacity is\n\nindisputably not a final decision amenable to interlocutory review. Our\n\nassumption of jurisdiction over the court’s resolution of the official-capacity\n\nclaim would therefore only be appropriate if we invoked our discretionary power\n\nto exercise pendent jurisdiction over this claim. Sheriff Glanz, however, has not\n\nrelied upon this generally disfavored doctrine; furthermore, we discern no legally\n\ncognizable basis for exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction under the\n\ncircumstances of this case. Accordingly, we dismiss Sheriff Glanz’s appeal from\n\nthe district court’s denial of summary judgment on the official-capacity claim for\n\nlack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                          A\n\n      Mr. Jernegan surrendered at the Jail on July 27, 2009, on an outstanding\n\nwarrant. He was immediately arrested and processed into the facility. As part of\n\nthe Jail’s routine intake screening, the booking officer asked Mr. Jernegan\n\nwhether he “[was] under psychiatric or a general Doctor’s care”; “[was] currently\n\ntaking any prescription medications”; “[had] been seen or treated in a clinic,\n\nhospital or emergency room in the last 3 days”; or was suicidal. J.A. at 326\n\n                                          4\n\f(Intake Screening Form, dated July 27, 2009). Mr. Jernegan answered “no” to\n\neach of these questions, id., and he indicated that he was not “currently thinking\n\nof committing suicide” on another intake form, id. at 327 (Gen. Info. Form, dated\n\nJuly 27, 2009) (reflecting that option “N,” for “no,” is marked directly above Mr.\n\nJernegan’s signature).\n\n      The booking officer also completed a more tailored form with questions\n\ndesigned to gauge an inmate’s mental health. Mr. Jernegan answered the form’s\n\nsix questions as follows:\n\n             1.      Do you currently feel paranoid, hear voices that others do\n                     not hear or see things that others do not see? [marked\n                     “Yes”]\n             2.      Have there currently been a few weeks when you felt\n                     nervous or depressed? [marked “Yes”]\n             3.      Have you ever tried to kill yourself? [marked “No”]\n             4.      Are you now thinking about hurting or killing yourself?\n                     [marked “No”]\n             5.      Are you currently taking any medication prescribed for\n                     you by a physician for any emotional or mental health\n                     problems? [marked “Yes”]\n             6.      Have you ever been in a hospital for emotional or mental\n                     health problems? [marked “No”]\n\nId. at 329 (Mental Health Form, dated July 27, 2009). An explanatory note\n\n“Diag. Paranoid-Schizo” accompanies Mr. Jernegan’s “[y]es” response to\n\nQuestion Five. Id.\n\n      This mental-health form indicated that further assessment should take place\n\nif, inter alia, an inmate answered “[y]es” to Question Five or Six, or if he\n\nanswered “[y]es” to at least two of Questions One through Four. Mr. Jernegan’s\n\n                                           5\n\fanswers satisfied both criteria: that is, he answered “[y]es” to Question Five,\n\nrepresenting that he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and he\n\nanswered “[y]es” to Questions One and Two. However, there is no indication in\n\nthe record that any Jail employee referred Mr. Jernegan to the facility’s mental-\n\nhealth team for follow-up care.\n\n      Nurse Faye Taylor also performed a medical examination, using her own\n\npersonal screening form. On that document, she noted Mr. Jernegan’s\n\nrepresentations to her that he had “had mental health treatment or hospitalization”\n\nfor paranoid schizophrenia, that he had smoked marijuana, and that he was not\n\nsuicidal. Id. at 603 (Healthcare Intake Screening Form, dated July 27, 2009).\n\nMs. Taylor observed that Mr. Jernegan had regular vital signs and that he\n\nappeared normal and alert. She did not mark the “[r]eferral to health care\n\nfacility” or “[r]eferral to provider” options on her form. Id. On the basis of these\n\nfindings, Ms. Taylor recommended that Mr. Jernegan be assigned to the Jail’s\n\ngeneral population.\n\n      At 12:18 p.m. the next day (July 28, 2009), Mr. Jernegan filed a medical\n\nrequest through the Jail’s computer “kiosk” communication system to report that\n\nhe needed to “spe[a]k with someone about problems.” Id. at 362 (Request, dated\n\nJuly 28, 2009) (capitalization altered). He received an automated response the\n\nday after that (July 29, 2009) at 10:07 a.m.; it said, “[y]ou will be place[d] on the\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fMental Health call out list for . . . July 30, 2009. Please give 48–72 hours from\n\n[the] time this was received to be seen, excluding Weekends and Holidays.” Id.\n\n      Mr. Jernegan’s Jail medical record revealed another relevant entry: a\n\n“Problem Oriented Record” entry dated July 30, 2009, at 8:00 a.m., which notes\n\nthat healthcare employee Sara Sampson “[a]ttempted to see” Mr. Jernegan but\n\nlearned that he had been moved to a different cellblock. Id. at 372 (Problem\n\nOriented Record, dated July 30, 2009) (capitalization altered). Although the\n\nrecord does not confirm that Ms. Sampson actually visited Mr. Jernegan,\n\nsupervising officers were apparently “satisfied that Sampson had performed her\n\njob as expected.” Id. at 659 (Incident Report, dated Aug. 3, 2009).\n\n      Shortly thereafter, at approximately 9:25 a.m. (on July 30), Nurses Robin\n\nMason and Sara Jeffries were summoned to Mr. Jernegan’s cellblock, having been\n\ninformed that an inmate had hanged himself. When they arrived, they found Mr.\n\nJernegan “still hanging from a make-shift noose and being cut down by detention\n\nstaff.” Id. at 468 (Mason Aff., dated Mar. 22, 2013). Mr. Jernegan had no\n\npalpable pulse and did not respond to resuscitative measures. He was\n\nsubsequently pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\n      After reviewing Mr. Jernegan’s file, Ms. Mason “became suspicious”\n\nregarding the follow-up to his kiosk request. Id. More specifically, she was not\n\nconfident of the truth of Ms. Sampson’s purported visit to Mr. Jernegan because:\n\n(1) she “had never seen any member of the mental health team at the Jail as early\n\n                                          7\n\fas 8:00[ a.m.]”; (2) she had witnessed efforts by Ms. Sampson and other members\n\nof the mental-health team to “mak[e] sure to have consistent stories” about Mr.\n\nJernegan’s treatment; and (3) she “had previous experience in witnessing the\n\nfalsification of records and reports at the Jail.” Id. at 468–69. It was also\n\ndisconcerting to Ms. Mason that the Jail’s intake nurses’ apparent practice was to\n\nrefer only “acutely suicidal” inmates to the mental-health team for additional\n\nevaluation. Id. at 470.\n\n      The Oklahoma State Department of Health (“OSDH”) conducted an\n\ninvestigation and determined that Mr. Jernegan was not examined by any member\n\nof the Jail’s mental-health team in the time period between the filing of his kiosk\n\nreport and his death. It issued a report attributing three particular deficiencies to\n\nthe Jail relative to Mr. Jernegan’s suicide: (1) “inmate not properly detained”; (2)\n\n“inmate not housed in an area for more frequent observations” / “inappropriate\n\nmedical evaluation”; and (3) “policy used by correctional healthcare management\n\nin direct conflict with the [Oklahoma] Jail Standards.” Id. at 625 (Report of\n\nDeath Investigation, dated Aug. 3, 2009) (capitalization altered). The OSDH then\n\nfiled a “Notice of Violation” documenting the Jail’s failure to satisfy three of the\n\nOklahoma Jail Standards (“Standards”).\n\n      With regard to the Jail’s particular violations, the OSDH first cited\n\nStandard 5-5(6), which provides: “Prisoners who are mentally ill shall be\n\nseparated from other prisoners. Every effort shall be made to contact a local\n\n                                           8\n\fhospital, clinic or mental health facility for the detention of the mentally ill.”\n\nOkla. Admin. Code § 310:670-5-5(6). The OSDH found the Jail in violation of\n\nthat standard “because [Mr. Jernegan] was not properly segregated.” J.A. at 631\n\n(Notice of Violation, dated Aug. 12, 2009). Second, the OSDH deemed the Jail’s\n\nmedical policies in “direct conflict,” id., with Standard 5-8, which obligates\n\ncorrectional facilities to provide “[a]dequate medical care” and to “develop and\n\nimplement written policies and procedures for complete emergency medical and\n\nhealth care services,” Okla. Admin. Code § 310:670-5-8.\n\n      And, third, the OSDH referenced Standard 5-8(2), which instructs:\n\n             Medical triage screening shall be performed on all prisoners\n             immediately upon admission to the facility and before being\n             placed in the general population or housing area. Those\n             individuals who appear to have a significant medical or\n             psychiatric problem, or who may be a suicide risk, shall be\n             transported to the supporting medical facility as soon as possible.\n             They shall be housed separately in a location where they can be\n             observed frequently by the staff at least until the appropriate\n             medical evaluation has been completed. . . . [A]fter stringent\n             evaluation by the highest-ranking mental health professional, in\n             conjunction with a senior detention supervisor, these prisoners\n             may be authorized to share the same cell.\n\nId. § 310:670-5-8(2). The OSDH found that the Jail contravened Standard 5-8(2)\n\n“because [Mr. Jernegan] was not housed in an area for more frequent\n\nobservations” and because the Jail conducted an “[i]nappropriate medical\n\nevaluation.” J.A. at 632.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                                           B\n\n                                           1\n\n      Ms. Cox commenced the instant litigation in 2011. In the operative version\n\nof her complaint, she asserted claims against Sheriff Glanz, the company that\n\nprovided healthcare services to the Jail, and several of the Jail’s healthcare\n\nemployees, including Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson. As relevant to this appeal,\n\nMs. Cox sued the Sheriff in his individual and official capacities pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging that his failure to provide adequate and timely mental-\n\nhealth screening and care constituted deliberate indifference to Mr. Jernegan’s\n\nserious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ms. Cox averred\n\nthat “Mr. Jernegan had a substantial and documented history of serious mental\n\nillness” at the Jail and, in light of this history, she asserted that the Sheriff and his\n\nstaff should have perceived “a strong likelihood that Mr. Jernegan was in danger\n\nof serious personal harm.” J.A. at 47 (Second Am. Compl., filed Apr. 4, 2012).\n\n      On the individual-capacity claim, Ms. Cox asserted a supervisory-liability\n\ntheory grounded in the Sheriff’s alleged failure to properly train and supervise\n\nJail employees such as Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson. On the official-capacity\n\nclaim, she stated that the Sheriff had promulgated and administered an\n\nunconstitutional policy of providing insufficient mental-health evaluation and\n\ntreatment—a policy that ultimately resulted in Mr. Jernegan’s death.\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f      Sheriff Glanz moved for summary judgment, contending that he was\n\nentitled to qualified immunity on the individual-capacity claim1 because Ms. Cox\n\nhad not established that: (1) any Jail employee had acted with deliberate\n\nindifference toward Mr. Jernegan’s serious medical needs; (2) he, as the Jail\n\nadministrator, had acted with the requisite state of mind to support a deliberate-\n\nindifference claim; and (3) he had created any policy that produced the\n\ncomplained-of constitutional harm. He framed his qualified-immunity arguments\n\nin terms of Ms. Cox’s purported failure to suitably establish a violation of a\n\nconstitutional right. Similarly, in rebutting the official-capacity claim, the Sheriff\n\nargued that Ms. Cox had not shown that any of the Jail policies he administered\n\nhad violated Mr. Jernegan’s constitutional rights.\n\n      Ms. Cox responded to the Sheriff’s assertion of qualified immunity in\n\nsimilar fashion—i.e., by focusing on whether a constitutional violation had\n\noccurred. She opined that her claims “raised bedrock constitutional Eighth\n\nAmendment . . . principles that appl[ied] with obvious clarity to the conduct in\n\nquestion.” Id. at 444 (Pl.’s Resp. Br., filed Apr. 3, 2013). In particular, Ms. Cox\n\nalleged that Mr. Jernegan’s constitutional rights were violated when he was\n\n“assessed and treated by undertrained and unsupervised [Jail] staff.” Id. at 438.\n\n      1\n              The defense of qualified immunity “is available only in suits against\nofficials sued in their personal capacities, not in suits against . . . officials sued in\ntheir official capacities.” Starkey v. Boulder Cty. Soc. Servs., 569 F.3d 1244,\n1263 n.4 (10th Cir. 2009); accord Becker v. Bateman, 709 F.3d 1019, 1022 (10th\nCir. 2013).\n\n                                           11\n\fShe cursorily referenced the other aspect of the well-settled qualified-immunity\n\nrubric—i.e., the existence of clearly established law that dispositively condemned\n\nthe conduct at the time it occurred—insisting that Mr. Jernegan’s “right to\n\nadequate medical care and to be free from deliberate indifference ha[d] been\n\nclearly established for decades.” Id. at 444 (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S.\n\n97, 103–04 (1976)).\n\n      In his reply brief, Sheriff Glanz rejoined that Ms. Cox had still not\n\n“present[ed] any evidence that would satisfy th[e] subjective component [of a\n\ndeliberate-indifference claim] for Taylor, Sampson or Glanz.” Id. at 991 (Def.’s\n\nReply Br., filed Apr. 17, 2013). He concluded that “he w[as] therefore\n\nqualifiedly immune.” Id. at 995. Sheriff Glanz did not go one step further and\n\nargue that there was no extant clearly established law supportive of Ms. Cox’s\n\nclaims; he was silent on this question.\n\n                                          2\n\n      On March 7, 2014, the district court issued an order denying Sheriff\n\nGlanz’s motion. The court expressly ruled that “genuine disputes as to material\n\nfacts[] render[ed] summary judgment inappropriate.” Id. at 1089 (Op. & Order,\n\nfiled Mar. 7, 2014). It reached this conclusion without addressing the parties’\n\nqualified-immunity arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      At the outset, the district court summarized the evidence it considered most\n\nsalient, including evidence pertaining to Mr. Jernegan’s other 2009 Jail bookings, 2\n\nSheriff Glanz’s alleged knowledge of deliberately indifferent treatment of other\n\nmentally-ill inmates, and the Jail’s actual practices and policies. The court then\n\naddressed Ms. Cox’s individual-capacity § 1983 claim, noting that only the\n\nsubjective aspect of the deliberate-indifference standard was in dispute—viz.,\n\nwhether there was sufficient “evidence of the prison official’s culpable state of\n\nmind.” Mata v. Saiz, 427 F.3d 745, 751 (10th Cir. 2005). 3\n\n      In that regard, the court reasoned, the evidence demonstrated that Jail\n\nemployees either knew or should have known certain key facts, including that Mr.\n\nJernegan had self-reported paranoid schizophrenia; that he had lodged kiosk\n\n      2\n            Mr. Jernegan was incarcerated in the Jail’s general population in\nJanuary, February, and May of 2009. The summary-judgment record contained\nseveral submissions from each of his bookings, including kiosk requests that he\nlodged.\n      3\n              Briefly stated, deliberate indifference has both an objective and a\nsubjective component. The objective inquiry concerns “whether the harm\nsuffered rises to a level ‘sufficiently serious’ to be cognizable under the Cruel and\nUnusual Punishment Clause.” Mata, 427 F.3d at 753 (quoting Farmer v.\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994)). Sheriff Glanz has not contested the district\ncourt’s tacit conclusion that the objective prong of the deliberate-indifference\nstandard was satisfied here. And this is wise. See Martinez v. Beggs, 563 F.3d\n1082, 1088 (10th Cir. 2009) (observing that death, “without doubt,” is\n“sufficiently serious to meet the objective component” (citation omitted)); Collins\nv. Seeman, 462 F.3d 757, 760 (7th Cir. 2006) (“[I]t goes without saying that\n‘suicide is a serious harm.’” (quoting Sanville v. McCaughtry, 266 F.3d 724, 733\n(7th Cir. 2001))). Accordingly, we also accept the court’s tacit conclusion.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\frequests in prior incarcerations; and that “approximately 45 hours before he was\n\nfound hanging from a bed sheet in his cell, he requested mental health help for\n\nproblems, but there was no mental health visit during the two days that followed.”\n\nJ.A. at 1121. The court further found that “[t]he failure to refer [Mr. Jernegan]\n\nfor mental health evaluation [was] consistent with the established practice at the\n\nJail . . . of not referring even obviously mentally ill inmates unless they admitted\n\nto being suicidal.” Id. Rejecting Sheriff Glanz’s reliance upon the existence of\n\nvarious written policies and training materials to prove that he did not act with\n\ndeliberate indifference, the district court found “genuine issues of material fact as\n\nto whether and to what extent [those] policies were followed or enforced by the\n\nSheriff.” Id. at 1124.\n\n      Ultimately, after explicating the content of and otherwise considering the\n\nparties’ submissions, the district court concluded:\n\n             Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the\n             Court concludes that there are triable issues of material fact as to\n             whether the [Sheriff’s Office’s] written policies were the actual\n             policies, whether they were followed or enforced, and whether\n             the Jail’s personnel were properly trained to identify and\n             segregate mentally ill inmates who may be at risk of suicide.\n\n             The same evidence presents issues of material fact regarding\n             whether Sheriff Glanz was on notice of constitutional\n             deficiencies in the care of mentally ill detainees and whether his\n             failure to take appropriate measures to remedy those deficiencies\n             constituted deliberate indifference.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fId. at 1127 (citations omitted). However, at no point during its analysis did the\n\ncourt explicitly focus on the legal framework of qualified immunity—viz., it did\n\nnot discuss whether Ms. Cox had demonstrated the violation of a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional right by any of the Jail-employee defendants or by\n\nSheriff Glanz himself. Nevertheless, it did ultimately deny Sheriff Glanz’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment—which asserted a qualified-immunity defense—in\n\nall respects.\n\n      This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                          II\n\n                                          A\n\n      Before reaching the merits, we must address Ms. Cox’s argument that we\n\nlack jurisdiction to entertain the Sheriff’s interlocutory appeal of the district\n\ncourt’s denial of qualified immunity. See Franklin Sav. Corp. v. United States (In\n\nre Franklin Sav. Corp.), 385 F.3d 1279, 1286 (10th Cir. 2004) (“Jurisdictional\n\nissues must be addressed first and, if they are resolved against jurisdiction, the\n\ncase is at an end.”); see also San Juan Cty. v. United States, 754 F.3d 787, 792\n\n(10th Cir. 2014). Ms. Cox contends that dismissal on jurisdictional grounds is\n\nmandatory because, as noted, the district court based its decision regarding the\n\nindividual-capacity claim on the existence of genuinely disputed material facts.\n\nWhile we recognize the significance of Ms. Cox’s concerns about the district\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fcourt’s qualified-immunity methodology, we are satisfied, for the reasons stated\n\nbelow, that we have jurisdiction to proceed to the merits of this claim.\n\n      Federal “appellate courts typically do not have jurisdiction to review\n\ndenials of summary judgment motions,” Serna v. Colo. Dep’t of Corr., 455 F.3d\n\n1146, 1150 (10th Cir. 2006), but “[t]he denial of qualified immunity to a public\n\nofficial . . . is immediately appealable . . . to the extent it involves abstract issues\n\nof law,” Fancher v. Barrientos, 723 F.3d 1191, 1198 (10th Cir. 2013).\n\nSpecifically, we have jurisdiction “to review ‘(1) whether the facts that the\n\ndistrict court ruled a reasonable jury could find would suffice to show a legal\n\nviolation, or (2) whether that law was clearly established at the time of the\n\nalleged violation.’” Roosevelt-Hennix v. Prickett, 717 F.3d 751, 753 (10th Cir.\n\n2013) (quoting Allstate Sweeping, LLC v. Black, 706 F.3d 1261, 1267 (10th Cir.\n\n2013)); see also Castillo v. Day, 790 F.3d 1013, 1019 (10th Cir. 2015) (describing\n\nthe two prongs thusly: “(1) the defendant violated [the plaintiff’s] constitutional\n\nor statutory rights, and (2) the right was clearly established at the time of the\n\nalleged unlawful activity”).\n\n      The district court’s factual findings and reasonable assumptions comprise\n\n“the universe of facts upon which we base our legal review of whether defendants\n\nare entitled to qualified immunity.” Fogarty v. Gallegos, 523 F.3d 1147, 1154\n\n(10th Cir. 2008); accord Buck v. City of Albuquerque, 549 F.3d 1269, 1276 (10th\n\nCir. 2008). When the district court “concludes that a reasonable jury could find\n\n                                            16\n\fcertain specified facts in favor of the plaintiff, . . . we usually must take them as\n\ntrue—and do so even if our own de novo review of the record might suggest\n\notherwise as a matter of law.” Lewis v. Tripp, 604 F.3d 1221, 1225 (10th Cir.\n\n2010).\n\n         However, importantly, “whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a\n\n‘genuine’ issue of fact for trial” is not an abstract legal question that we may\n\nreview. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 320 (1995); accord Allstate Sweeping,\n\n706 F.3d at 1267. But our jurisdiction on appeal nevertheless “is clear when the\n\ndefendant does not dispute the facts alleged by the plaintiff. . . . [I]f the\n\ndefendant does dispute the plaintiff’s allegations[,] ‘the defendant must\n\nnonetheless be willing to concede the most favorable view of the facts to the\n\nplaintiff for purposes of the appeal.’” Farmer v. Perrill, 288 F.3d 1254, 1258 n.4\n\n(10th Cir. 2002) (quoting Berryman v. Rieger, 150 F.3d 561, 563 (6th Cir. 1998));\n\nsee also Castillo, 790 F.3d at 1018 (“[Defendant] presents an appellate argument\n\nover which we do have jurisdiction. She asserts Plaintiffs cannot establish a\n\nviolation of their Eighth Amendment rights based on the facts they have alleged.”\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n         In this regard, we have said that “[e]ven when the district court concludes\n\nissues of material fact exist, ‘we have reviewed the legal question of whether a\n\ndefendant’s conduct, as alleged by the plaintiff, violates clearly established law.’”\n\nHolland ex rel. Overdorff v. Harrington, 268 F.3d 1179, 1186 (10th Cir. 2001)\n\n                                           17\n\f(quoting Medina v. Cram, 252 F.3d 1124, 1130 (10th Cir. 2001)). “We need\n\nnot . . . decline review of a pretrial order denying summary judgment [in the\n\nqualified-immunity context] solely because the district court says genuine issues\n\nof material fact remain; instead, we lack jurisdiction only if our review would\n\nrequire second-guessing the district court’s determinations of evidence\n\nsufficiency.” Medina, 252 F.3d at 1130.\n\n      In light of these principles, we conclude that we can properly exercise\n\njurisdiction over the aspect of this appeal that is based on the district court’s\n\ndenial of Sheriff Glanz’s qualified-immunity defense. 4 At the outset, we\n\nacknowledge that Ms. Cox’s concerns regarding the district court’s methodology\n\nhave some merit. The court’s analysis was not consonant with our settled mode\n\nof qualified-immunity decisionmaking. Specifically, the court’s central focus was\n\non the existence vel non of genuinely disputed issues of material fact, and that\n\nfocus is counter to our established qualified-immunity approach. See Allstate\n\nSweeping, 706 F.3d at 1267. At the summary-judgment phase, a federal court’s\n\nfactual analysis relative to the qualified-immunity question is distinct:\n\n             [T]he objective is not to determine whether a plaintiff survives\n             summary judgment because plaintiff’s evidence raises material\n             issues that warrant resolution by a jury. Instead, the principal\n\n      4\n             As we have noted, we apply a different mode of analysis to the\nSheriff’s challenge to the district court’s disposition of Ms. Cox’s official-\ncapacity claim—specifically, as explicated infra in Part III.B, we conclude that\nwe lack jurisdiction to review the court’s ruling on that claim, and we dismiss this\naspect of the appeal.\n\n                                      18\n\f             purpose is to determine whether plaintiff’s factual allegations\n             are sufficiently grounded in the record such that they may\n             permissibly comprise the universe of facts that will serve as the\n             foundation for answering the legal question before the court.\n\nThomson v. Salt Lake Cty., 584 F.3d 1304, 1326 (10th Cir. 2009) (Holmes, J.,\n\nconcurring); see also United States ex rel. Burlbaw v. Orenduff, 548 F.3d 931,\n\n940 n.6 (10th Cir. 2008) (exhorting courts to “exercise care not to confuse the two\n\nanalytic frameworks” of qualified immunity and traditional summary judgment,\n\nthough acknowledging that, “at least in some instances, this . . . is easier said than\n\ndone”).\n\n      Although its mode of analysis focusing on the existence vel non of factual\n\ndisputes was wanting, the district court clearly adjudicated Sheriff Glanz’s\n\ndefense of qualified immunity and ruled against him, albeit tacitly so. Perhaps\n\nbecause it was set adrift by the deficiencies of the parties’ briefing, which are\n\nexplicated infra, the district court did not mention qualified immunity in its\n\nsummary-judgment order. However—critically, for purposes of our interlocutory\n\nreview—the court did explicitly deny Sheriff Glanz all relief in its order, and part\n\nof the relief that Sheriff Glanz unquestionably sought in his summary-judgment\n\nbriefing was qualified immunity. Consequently, the court effectively denied\n\nSheriff Glanz the defense of qualified immunity when it denied his summary-\n\njudgment motion. 5\n\n      5\n             Even if this were not so, our precedent would safeguard Sheriff\n                                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                          19\n\f      Ms. Cox nevertheless suggests that the court’s fact-based manner of\n\ndisposing of the defense divests us of jurisdiction to reach the qualified-immunity\n\nissue on appeal. We disagree. Notably, Sheriff Glanz has accepted the truth of\n\nMs. Cox’s version of the facts for purposes of this appeal. Under our controlling\n\ncaselaw (discussed supra), that ordinarily will permit us to address the legal\n\nissues presented by the agreed-upon set of facts, and there is nothing about this\n\ncase that would counsel against following that path. Cf. Castillo, 790 F.3d at\n\n1018 (“Although [Defendant] attempts to characterize the issue on appeal as\n\nPlaintiffs’ failure to assert a violation of a constitutional right under clearly\n\nestablished law, her argument is limited to a discussion of her version of the facts\n\nand the inferences that can be drawn therefrom. Thus, [Defendant’s] argument is\n\nactually a challenge to the district court’s conclusion Plaintiffs presented\n\nsufficient evidence to survive summary judgment. As such, this court lacks\n\njurisdiction to review her appeal at the interlocutory stage.” (emphasis added)\n\n(footnote omitted)). Therefore, under settled circuit precedent, we do have\n\n      5\n        (...continued)\nGlanz’s opportunity to avail himself of the protections of the qualified-immunity\ndefense. In this regard, we have observed that “[o]ther circuits have concluded\nthat orders failing or refusing to consider qualified immunity are also immediately\nappealable,” and we have “agree[d] with this approach.” Lowe v. Town of\nFairland, 143 F.3d 1378, 1380 (10th Cir. 1998) (citing caselaw from the Second,\nFifth, and Eighth Circuits). This is quite appropriate because the availability of\nthe qualified-immunity defense—which has the potential to spare a public official\nthe burdens of trial, see Allstate Sweeping, 706 F.3d at 1266—should not turn on\nwhether the district court decided to address the defense or failed (through\noversight or otherwise) to do so.\n\n                                           20\n\fappellate jurisdiction over Sheriff Glanz’s interlocutory appeal from the denial of\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                           B\n\n      Ms. Cox alternatively claims that even if we have jurisdiction over this\n\naspect of the appeal, we should not reach the merits of Sheriff Glanz’s qualified-\n\nimmunity arguments because he failed to raise them before the district court.\n\nSpecifically, she tenders the following issue-preservation argument:\n\n             Sheriff Glanz’s primary argument on appeal is that he is entitled\n             to qualified immunity because it is not “clearly established” that\n             a detainee has a right to be screened for suicidal tendencies or\n             that failure to refer an individual for a mental health screening\n             can give rise to a civil rights violation . . . . [T]his argument was\n             never properly raised by Sheriff Glanz as a basis for qualified\n             immunity below.\n\nAplee. Br. at 30 (citation omitted). Ms. Cox avers that because Sheriff Glanz\n\nexclusively briefed the no-constitutional-violation issue at summary judgment, he\n\nis not entitled to expand the inquiry on appeal by claiming an absence of clearly\n\nestablished law.\n\n      In effect, Ms. Cox asks us to deem Sheriff Glanz’s clearly-established-law\n\nargument to be forfeited. See, e.g., Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc., 634 F.3d 1123,\n\n1127–28 (10th Cir. 2011) (“Where, as here, a plaintiff pursues a new legal theory\n\nfor the first time on appeal, that new theory suffers the distinct disadvantage of\n\nstarting at least a few paces back from the block. . . . [I]f the theory simply\n\nwasn’t raised before the district court, we usually hold it forfeited.” (citations\n\n                                          21\n\fomitted)). “Yet, the decision regarding what issues are appropriate to entertain on\n\nappeal in instances of lack of preservation is discretionary.” Abernathy v.\n\nWandes, 713 F.3d 538, 552 (10th Cir. 2013); accord Bishop v. Smith, 760 F.3d\n\n1070, 1095 (10th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 135 S. Ct. 271 (2014); see\n\nalso Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976) (“The matter of what questions\n\nmay be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to\n\nthe discretion of the courts of appeals, to be exercised on the facts of individual\n\ncases.”); cf. Bishop, 760 F.3d at 1095 (“Waiver through appellate-briefing\n\nomission and forfeiture through silence before the district court are admittedly\n\ndistinct failures of preservation, and arguably there is more discretionary leeway\n\nto consider issues not preserved under the latter (forfeiture) than the former\n\n(appellate-briefing waiver).”).\n\n      In the unique factual and legal context of this case, even assuming\n\narguendo that Sheriff Glanz forfeited his appellate arguments based on the\n\nclearly-established-law prong of the qualified-immunity standard, we would deem\n\nconsideration of these arguments to be an appropriate exercise of our discretion.\n\nAt the outset, we observe that the qualified-immunity arguments of both parties\n\nbefore the district court left much to be desired. In this regard, Sheriff Glanz’s\n\nbriefing was assuredly not robust. Therein, he vaguely asserted, regarding\n\nqualified immunity and in particular, the constitutional-violation question, that\n\nthe “materials presented in [his] Statement of Undisputed Facts . . . are direct\n\n                                          22\n\fevidence that [he] [wa]s not indifferent, deliberately or otherwise.” J.A. at 241\n\n(Mot. for Summ. J., filed Feb. 28, 2013). Yet, however poorly asserted, Sheriff\n\nGlanz indisputably did present a qualified-immunity defense in his summary-\n\njudgment briefing. And this defense necessarily included the clearly-established-\n\nlaw question. See, e.g., Castillo, 790 F.3d at 1019; Roosevelt-Hennix, 717 F.3d at\n\n753.\n\n        The forfeiture issue turns on the extent of Sheriff Glanz’s obligation to do\n\nmore than nominally raise the qualified-immunity defense—that is, it turns on\n\nwhether he was obliged to marshal particularized arguments in support of the\n\nclearly-established-law question, viz., specific arguments demonstrating that,\n\nunder then-extant clearly established law, neither he nor any of his identified\n\nsubordinates violated Mr. Jernegan’s Eighth Amendment rights. Even assuming\n\narguendo that he was required to do this, and therefore forfeited his clearly-\n\nestablished-law arguments by failing to do so, we cannot ignore, in deciding\n\nwhether to recognize the forfeiture, the unique briefing burdens of the nonmovant\n\nplaintiff in the qualified-immunity context, and Ms. Cox’s feeble efforts to bear\n\nthem.\n\n        Specifically, by asserting the qualified-immunity defense, Sheriff Glanz\n\ntriggered a well-settled twofold burden that Ms. Cox was compelled to shoulder:\n\nnot only did she need to rebut the Sheriff’s no-constitutional-violation arguments,\n\nbut she also had to demonstrate that any constitutional violation was grounded in\n\n                                          23\n\fthen-extant clearly established law. See, e.g., Riggins v. Goodman, 572 F.3d\n\n1101, 1107 (10th Cir. 2009) (“When a defendant asserts qualified immunity at\n\nsummary judgment, the burden shifts to the plaintiff, who must clear two hurdles\n\nin order to defeat the defendant’s motion. The plaintiff must demonstrate on the\n\nfacts alleged both that the defendant violated his constitutional or statutory rights,\n\nand that the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged unlawful\n\nactivity.” (emphases added)); see also Felders v. Malcom, 755 F.3d 870, 877–78\n\n(10th Cir. 2014) (“[T]he ‘record must clearly demonstrate the plaintiff has\n\nsatisfied his heavy two-part burden; otherwise, the defendants are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.’” (quoting Medina, 252 F.3d at 1128)), cert. denied, ---\n\nU.S. ----, 135 S. Ct. 975 (2015); Mick v. Brewer, 76 F.3d 1127, 1134 (10th Cir.\n\n1996) (“Unless the plaintiff carries its twofold burden, the defendant prevails.”).\n\n      However, Ms. Cox made no more than an anemic attempt to carry this\n\nburden as to the clearly-established-law question, merely asserting in bare-bones\n\nfashion that Mr. Jernegan’s constitutional “right to adequate medical care and to\n\nbe free from deliberate indifference ha[d] been clearly established for decades.”\n\nJ.A. at 444. 6 Put another way, Ms. Cox did virtually nothing to define the\n\n      6\n              In this regard, Ms. Cox did cite in her summary-judgment briefing to\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). See J.A.\nat 444. However, regarding the resolution of the clearly-established-law question,\nEstelle is patently unavailing. Estelle undoubtedly “laid down [some] controlling\nprinciples” regarding deliberate indifference, Riddle v. Mondragon, 83 F.3d 1197,\n1203 (10th Cir. 1996), and likewise made clear that “negligent diagnosis or\n                                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                          24\n\fcontours of the clearly-established-law question, as to which she ultimately\n\ncarried the burden of proof in the qualified-immunity context. As a consequence,\n\nMs. Cox did little to aid the district court in its resolution of this question and\n\nperhaps contributed to the confusion evident in the district court’s misguided\n\nqualified-immunity analysis.\n\n      In any event, in deciding whether it is a proper exercise of our discretion to\n\noverlook the assumed forfeiture of Sheriff Glanz regarding the clearly-\n\nestablished-law question, Ms. Cox’s significant briefing shortcomings on this\n\nsame question—as to which she bears the burden of proof—should be taken into\n\naccount. And we do so when we elect here to reach the merits of Sheriff Glanz’s\n\nqualified-immunity arguments based on the absence of clearly established law. 7\n\n      6\n        (...continued)\ntreatment of a medical condition do[es] not constitute a medical wrong under the\nEighth Amendment,” Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 575 (10th Cir. 1980).\nHowever, Estelle does not speak to a right to proper suicide-screening protocols,\nand its silence sounds a deafening ring given the Supreme Court’s “repeated[ ]”\nadmonition “not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.”\nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2084 (2011).\n\n      7\n              Moreover, we also recognize that we can entertain a defendant’s\nargument on the clearly-established-law prong under certain circumstances, even\nif the argument had been forfeited in district court, because the issue involves a\npure matter of law. Specifically, “[o]ur discretion allows us to determine an issue\nraised for the first time on appeal if it is a pure matter of law and its proper\nresolution is certain.” United States v. Lyons, 510 F.3d 1225, 1238 (10th Cir.\n2007). These circumstances are present here, for the clearly-established-law\nprong of qualified immunity involves a pure matter of law. See Mitchell v.\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528 n.9 (1985) (stating that “the appealable issue is a\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                           25\n\f                                          III\n\n      The Sheriff contends that the district court committed two reversible errors\n\nin ruling on Ms. Cox’s § 1983 claims: he argues that the court erred when it (1)\n\nfailed to grant him qualified immunity on Ms. Cox’s individual-capacity claim,\n\nand (2) denied him summary judgment on Ms. Cox’s official-capacity claim. For\n\nthe reasons discussed herein, we conclude that the district court committed one\n\nreversible error. Specifically, we determine that the court erred in denying\n\nqualified immunity to the Sheriff; accordingly, we reverse that aspect of the\n\ncourt’s judgment. However, we do not address the Sheriff’s second claim of error\n\n(i.e., regarding the denial of summary judgment on Ms. Cox’s official-capacity\n\nclaim)—not only do we lack jurisdiction to review this claim on interlocutory\n\nappeal, but we also decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over it.\n\nConsequently, we are constrained to dismiss the aspect of the Sheriff’s appeal\n\nconcerning liability in his official capacity.\n\n\n\n      7\n        (...continued)\npurely legal one: whether the facts alleged (by the plaintiff, or, in some cases, the\ndefendant) support a claim of violation of clearly established law”). And, as\ndiscussed infra, resolution of the clearly-established-law prong is certain here. In\nthese circumstances, we can therefore entertain the argument of a defendant, like\nSheriff Glanz, on the clearly-established-law prong even if the argument had been\nforfeited in district court. See Dean v. Blumenthal, 577 F.3d 60, 67 n.6 (2d Cir.\n2009) (per curiam) (considering an argument on the clearly-established-law prong\nof qualified immunity, even though presented for the first time on appeal, because\nthe issue involves a question of law and does not require any additional fact-\nfinding).\n\n                                          26\n\f                                            A\n\n          As noted, Sheriff Glanz’s entitlement to qualified immunity vel non\n\ndepends on whether Ms. Cox has “show[n] that: (1) [he] violated a constitutional\n\nright and (2) the constitutional right was clearly established.” Courtney v.\n\nOklahoma ex rel. Dep’t of Pub. Safety, 722 F.3d 1216, 1222 (10th Cir. 2013)\n\n(quoting Becker v. Bateman, 709 F.3d 1019, 1022 (10th Cir. 2013)). “We have\n\ndiscretion to address either prong [of this standard] first.” Panagoulakos v.\n\nYazzie, 741 F.3d 1126, 1129 (10th Cir. 2013); see also Pearson v. Callahan, 555\n\nU.S. 223, 236 (2009). Like Sheriff Glanz does in his arguments before us, we\n\nelect to focus on the second prong—wherein we inquire whether, under Ms. Cox’s\n\nversion of the facts, then-extant clearly established law would have given Sheriff\n\nGlanz fair warning that he could be held liable for his conduct under a\n\nsupervisory-liability theory for violating Mr. Jernegan’s Eighth Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n          Regarding the requisite proof of clearly established law, “[a] plaintiff may\n\nsatisfy this standard by identifying an on-point Supreme Court or published Tenth\n\nCircuit decision; alternatively, ‘the clearly established weight of authority from\n\nother courts must have found the law to be as the plaintiff maintains.’” Quinn v.\n\nYoung, 780 F.3d 998, 1005 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Weise v. Casper, 593 F.3d\n\n1163, 1167 (10th Cir. 2010)); see also Klen v. City of Loveland, 661 F.3d 498,\n\n511 (10th Cir. 2011). We conclude that the right that Ms. Cox’s claim\n\n                                            27\n\fimplicates—i.e., generally, an inmate’s right to proper prison suicide screening\n\nprocedures during booking—was not clearly established in July 2009.\n\n      Significantly, Ms. Cox has not directed our attention to any Supreme Court\n\nor Tenth Circuit decision (published or otherwise) that would indicate that this\n\nright was clearly established in 2009, 8 and the district court likewise did not rely\n\non any such law. Nor, for that matter, has Ms. Cox attempted to shoulder her\n\nburden by showing that “the clearly established weight of authority from other\n\ncourts . . . ha[s] found the law to be as [she] maintains.” Becker, 709 F.3d at\n\n1023 (quoting Morris v. Noe, 672 F.3d 1185, 1196 (10th Cir. 2012)). On this\n\nbasis alone, we could hold that Ms. Cox has not properly laid the groundwork to\n\ndefeat Sheriff Glanz’s assertion of qualified immunity.\n\n      In the interest of thoroughness, however, we have surveyed the then-extant\n\ncaselaw that would have guided the Sheriff’s endeavors to conform his\n\nsupervisory conduct to constitutional norms. The results of our survey are\n\ndetailed infra. Viewing the clearly-established-law question in this survey’s\n\n\n      8\n             Ms. Cox cannot discharge her burden by relying upon authorities that\ndo no more than establish general legal principles—even if those principles are\napposite in the Eighth Amendment deliberate-indifference context—such as the\nlegal truism that medical professionals in certain circumstances can be held liable\nfor handling their gatekeeper role with deliberate indifference. See Aplee. Br. at\n49 (discussing grounds for liability stemming from “clearly established law in this\nCircuit with respect to medical staff acting in a ‘gatekeeper’ role” (citing Sealock\nv. Colorado, 218 F.3d 1205, 1211 (10th Cir. 2000))). Ms. Cox’s arguments\nseeking “to define clearly established law at a high level of generality” are\nunavailing. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2084; see also supra note 6.\n\n                                          28\n\flight, we confidently conclude that the extant clearly established law in July 2009\n\nwould not have put a reasonable official in Sheriff Glanz’s position on notice that\n\nhis supervisory conduct would effect an Eighth Amendment violation. See Weise,\n\n593 F.3d at 1167 (noting that “the clearly established law must be such that it\n\nwould put a reasonable official on notice that his conduct was unlawful”); see\n\nalso Quinn, 780 F.3d at 1005 (stating that, in order to be clearly established law,\n\n“existing precedent must have placed the . . . constitutional question beyond\n\ndebate.” (quoting al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2083)). Accordingly, as a matter of law,\n\nwe conclude that Ms. Cox has failed to satisfy her burden on the clearly-\n\nestablished-law prong of the qualified-immunity standard. Thus, Sheriff Glanz is\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                          1\n\n      Prison and jail officials, as well as the municipal entities that employ them,\n\ncannot “absolutely guarantee the safety of their prisoners.” Lopez v. LeMaster,\n\n172 F.3d 756, 759 (10th Cir. 1999). Nonetheless, they “ha[ve] a constitutional\n\nduty to take reasonable steps to protect the prisoners’ safety and bodily integrity.”\n\nBerry v. City of Muskogee, 900 F.2d 1489, 1499 (10th Cir. 1990). “[C]laims\n\nbased on a jail suicide are considered and treated as claims based on the failure of\n\njail officials to provide medical care for those in their custody.” Barrie v. Grand\n\nCty., 119 F.3d 862, 866 (10th Cir. 1997). Therefore, such claims “must be judged\n\nagainst the ‘deliberate indifference to serious medical needs’ test.” Estate of\n\n                                         29\n\fHocker ex rel. Hocker v. Walsh, 22 F.3d 995, 998 (10th Cir. 1994) (quoting\n\nMartin v. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs, 909 F.2d 402, 406 (10th Cir. 1990)). As the\n\ndistrict court noted, the claims at issue here implicate the subjective component of\n\nthe deliberate-indifference rubric, under which the defendant must “both be aware\n\nof facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm exists, and . . . also draw the inference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n\n837 (1994).\n\n      Ms. Cox’s individual-capacity claim against Sheriff Glanz is predicated on\n\na supervisory-liability theory. It is undisputed that Sheriff Glanz had no personal\n\ncontact with Mr. Jernegan or direct and contemporaneous knowledge of Mr.\n\nJernegan’s treatment by Jail officials in July 2009. Yet, in a § 1983 lawsuit,\n\n“[s]upervisory liability ‘allows a plaintiff to impose liability upon a\n\ndefendant-supervisor who creates, promulgates, [or] implements . . . a\n\npolicy . . . which subjects, or causes to be subjected that plaintiff to the\n\ndeprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Constitution.’” Brown v. Montoya,\n\n662 F.3d 1152, 1163–64 (10th Cir. 2011) (second alteration in original)\n\n(omissions in original) (quoting Dodds v. Richardson, 614 F.3d 1185, 1199 (10th\n\nCir. 2010)). This does not equate to “liability under a theory of respondeat\n\nsuperior.” 9 Id. at 1164; accord Schneider v. City of Grand Junction Police Dep’t,\n\n      9\n              The Supreme Court has explained:\n\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                           30\n\f717 F.3d 760, 767 (10th Cir. 2013). A plaintiff arguing for the imposition of\n\nsupervisory liability “therefore must show an ‘affirmative link’ between the\n\nsupervisor and the constitutional violation.” Estate of Booker v. Gomez, 745 F.3d\n\n405, 435 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting Schneider, 717 F.3d at 767).\n\n      The requisite showing of an “affirmative link” between a supervisor and the\n\nalleged constitutional injury has “[come] to have three related prongs: (1)\n\npersonal involvement, (2) sufficient causal connection, and (3) culpable state of\n\nmind.” Dodds, 614 F.3d at 1195; accord Schneider, 717 F.3d at 767.\n\nAdmittedly, “[t]he contours of . . . supervisory liability are still somewhat unclear\n\nafter [the Supreme Court decided] Iqbal, which ‘articulated a stricter liability\n\nstandard for . . . personal involvement.’” Gomez, 745 F.3d at 435 (second\n\n\n      9\n          (...continued)\n                In a § 1983 suit . . . —where masters do not answer for the torts\n                of their servants—the term “supervisory liability” is a misnomer.\n                Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her\n                title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own\n                misconduct. In the context of determining whether there is a\n                violation of clearly established right to overcome qualified\n                immunity, purpose rather than knowledge is required to\n                impose . . . liability on the subordinate for unconstitutional\n                discrimination; the same holds true for an official charged with\n                violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677 (2009). Our caselaw appropriately notes this\ndistinction. See, e.g., Schneider v. City of Grand Junction Police Dep’t, 717 F.3d\n760, 767 (10th Cir. 2013) (“‘Section 1983 does not authorize liability under a\ntheory of respondeat superior.’ For this reason, the Supreme Court has suggested\nthe term ‘supervisory liability’ is ‘a misnomer.’” (footnote omitted) (citations\nomitted)); see also Brown, 662 F.3d at 1164.\n\n                                            31\n\fomission in original) (quoting Schneider, 717 F.3d at 768); see also Dodds, 614\n\nF.3d at 1198 (“Much has been made about [the supervisory-liability] aspect of\n\nIqbal, but consensus as to its meaning remains elusive.”). Even so, our\n\n“particularized approach [still] applies with full force when a plaintiff proceeds\n\nunder a theory of supervisory liability.” Pahls v. Thomas, 718 F.3d 1210, 1226\n\n(10th Cir. 2013). We continue to require plaintiffs to demonstrate “that each\n\ndefendant acted with the constitutionally requisite state of mind” by\n\n“identify[ing] . . . specific policies over which particular defendants possessed\n\nsupervisory responsibility[] that violated their clearly established constitutional\n\nrights.” Id. at 1228.\n\n      Our clearly-established-law analysis centers on whether the controlling\n\ncases “show that [Sheriff Glanz] took the alleged actions with the requisite state\n\nof mind.” Schneider, 717 F.3d at 769. This state of mind “‘can be no less than\n\nthe mens rea required’ of [any of his] subordinates [i.e., Jail employees] to\n\ncommit the underlying constitutional violation.” Gomez, 745 F.3d at 435 (quoting\n\nPorro v. Barnes, 624 F.3d 1322, 1328 (10th Cir. 2010)). Importantly, as our\n\ndiscussion of the pertinent governing caselaw infra demonstrates, this is a\n\nparticularized state of mind: actual knowledge by a prison official of an\n\nindividual inmate’s substantial risk of suicide.\n\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f                                          2\n\n                                          a\n\n      For purposes of demonstrating the violation of a clearly established\n\nconstitutional (i.e., Eighth Amendment) right in a jail-suicide case, our state-of-\n\nmind requirement has been settled since at least the mid-1990s. In Estate of\n\nHocker, we definitively enunciated the state of mind necessary to impose\n\ndeliberate-indifference liability upon jail employees when an inmate whose\n\nmental health was compromised by intoxication committed suicide shortly after\n\nbooking. See 22 F.3d at 1000. Noting that the trend of authority in the circuit\n\ncourts counseled in favor of requiring inmate-specific knowledge of a risk of\n\nsuicide, 10 we rejected the Estate’s invitation to hold that the booking officers’\n\nknowledge of the decedent inmate’s intoxication (which the officers obtained\n\nthrough routine intake questioning) could, by itself, confer knowledge that she\n\nposed a specific risk of suicide. See id. We concluded that evidence of her\n\n      10\n              In that regard, we gleaned guidance from decisions of the First,\nSixth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits. See Bowen v. City of Manchester, 966 F.2d\n13, 17 (1st Cir. 1992) (“Deliberate indifference requires a showing by the plaintiff\nthat the public official had actual knowledge, or was willfully blind, to the serious\nrisk that a detainee would commit suicide.”); Barber v. City of Salem, 953 F.2d\n232, 239 (6th Cir. 1992) (“[S]imple knowledge that the detainee fits the profile of\na high suicide risk is not enough. It must be knowledge specific to that particular\ndetainee.” (emphasis added)); Bell v. Stigers, 937 F.2d 1340, 1344 (8th Cir. 1991)\n(focusing on whether there was sufficient evidence that could “reasonably support\nthe existence of a strong likelihood that a particular prisoner will attempt\nsuicide” (emphasis added)), overruled on other grounds by Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n838; Popham v. City of Talladega, 908 F.2d 1561, 1563 (11th Cir. 1990) (per\ncuriam) (same as prior cases).\n\n                                          33\n\f“intoxication with its accompanying incoherence” did not confirm, much less\n\n“suggest[,] that [the inmate’s] risk of suicide was so substantial or pervasive that\n\nknowledge c[ould] be inferred.” Id. We held that, going forward, similarly\n\nsituated plaintiffs could only succeed on this species of claim by presenting “facts\n\n. . . suggest[ing] that the [facility] staff had knowledge of the specific risk that\n\n[the deceased inmate] would commit suicide.” Id.\n\n      Three years later, in Barrie v. Grand County, we noted with reference to\n\nHocker, that “in this circuit . . . . the custodian must be ‘deliberately indifferent’\n\nto a substantial risk of suicide.” 119 F.3d at 868–69 (emphasis added).\n\nMaintaining our inmate-specific focus, we declined to hold jail officials liable\n\nwhen the decedent inmate had indicated during booking that he was intoxicated,\n\nbut not suicidal; communicated that he felt “alright”; and otherwise appeared\n\n“fine” to the officers. Id. at 865. Under those circumstances, we concluded that\n\nthe officers’ assignment of the inmate to the jail’s “drunk tank” (as opposed to the\n\nalternative of furnishing immediate mental-health treatment) simply did “not rise\n\nto the level of ‘deliberate indifference’ to a known or obvious risk, which, in\n\n[that] case, [wa]s a substantial risk of suicide.” Id. at 869.\n\n      Our review of relevant caselaw postdating Hocker and Barrie indicates that\n\nthe foregoing state of the law in our circuit—which required prison officials to\n\npossess knowledge that a specific inmate presents a substantial risk of\n\nsuicide—had not changed in material respects by July 2009.\n\n                                           34\n\f      We are not aware of any controlling Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit\n\ndecisions that directly answer this clearly-established-law inquiry. However, our\n\nview of the requirements of the clearly established law extant when Mr. Jernegan\n\ncommitted suicide (July 2009) does find some support in the Supreme Court’s\n\nrecent decision in Taylor v. Barkes, --- U.S. ----, 135 S. Ct. 2042 (2015) (per\n\ncuriam), where the Court resolved a deliberate-indifference dispute on the clearly-\n\nestablished-law prong of the qualified-immunity standard. There, the Court held\n\nthat, as of November 2004, there was no clearly established “right” of an inmate\n\nto be adequately screened for suicide. See Taylor, 135 S. Ct. at 2044–45. The\n\nTaylor Court emphatically stated that “[n]o decision of this Court even discusses\n\nsuicide screening or prevention protocols.” Id. at 2044.\n\n      Taylor teaches us that, as of November 2004, there was no constitutional\n\nright to such screening or protocols. See Swanson v. Town of Mountain View, 577\n\nF.3d 1196, 1200 (10th Cir. 2009) (noting that “we also examine cases published\n\nafter the conduct in question to the extent they shed light on the fact that the law\n\nwas not clearly established at the relevant time” (emphasis added)).\n\nConsequently, in November 2004, a jail’s nonexistent or deficient suicide-\n\nscreening measures would not have necessarily indicated that an individual\n\nprisoner’s suicide was the product of deliberate indifference in violation of the\n\nEighth Amendment. In light of Taylor, our reading of the contours of the law a\n\nshort five years later should not be surprising. That is, irrespective of the alleged\n\n                                          35\n\fdeficiencies in the Jail’s suicide-screening protocols, in order for any defendant,\n\nincluding Sheriff Glanz, to be found to have acted with deliberate indifference, he\n\nneeded to first have knowledge that the specific inmate at issue presented a\n\nsubstantial risk of suicide. Moreover, though not dispositive, our limited corpus\n\nof nonprecedential jail-suicide decisions supports our reading of the state of the\n\nlaw when Mr. Jernegan committed suicide. See, e.g., Gaston v. Ploeger, 229 F.\n\nApp’x 702, 708 (10th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he appellants concede that a jailer violates\n\n[constitutional rights] if he is deliberately indifferent to a known risk that a . . .\n\ndetainee will commit suicide, and they do not challenge the district court’s\n\nconclusion that the law was clearly established at the time of [the inmate’s]\n\ndeath.” (citations omitted)); Daniels v. Glase, 198 F.3d 257, 1999 WL 1020522,\n\nat *4 (10th Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision) (“Accordingly, ‘the custodian\n\nmust be “deliberately indifferent” to a substantial risk of suicide.’” (quoting\n\nBarrie, 119 F.3d at 869)); see also Gomez, 745 F.3d at 428 n.29 (noting that\n\n“[a]lthough not dispositive of our inquiry because of its unpublished status,” an\n\nunpublished decision “need not be ignored in determining whether the law was\n\nclearly established”); cf. Morris, 672 F.3d at 1197 n.5 (“[W]e have never held that\n\na district court must ignore unpublished opinions in deciding whether the law is\n\nclearly established.”). 11\n\n       11\n          We acknowledge that in at least one unique setting—sexual assault in\nprison—we have taken a different stance on the knowledge of risk that must be\n                                                                   (continued...)\n\n                                            36\n\f      11\n          (...continued)\nalleged. In Tafoya v. Salazar, 516 F.3d 912 (10th Cir. 2008), we held that a\nprison “official’s knowledge of the risk [of sexual assault on a prisoner] need not\nbe knowledge of a substantial risk to a particular inmate, or knowledge of the\nparticular manner in which injury might occur.” 516 F.3d at 916. However, our\nstudy strongly indicates that Tafoya is distinguishable and should not cause us to\nquestion the clear guidance of our cases decided in the jail-suicide context.\nSpecifically, while the risk of sexual assault at issue in Tafoya frequently may be\ndivined from a myriad of external factors—including, notably, the sexual\nvictimizer’s characteristics—a substantial risk of suicide may be impossible to\ndiscern unless the particular inmate reveals indicia of that risk to prison officials.\nCompare Cash v. Cty. of Erie, 654 F.3d 324, 335 (2d Cir. 2011) (discussing\nevidence of “the risk of sexual exploitation posed by male deputies guarding\nfemale prisoners” at the county detention facility at issue), and Katherine Robb,\nWhat We Don’t Know Might Hurt Us: Subjective Knowledge and the Eighth\nAmendment’s Deliberate Indifference Standard for Sexual Abuse in Prisons, 65\nN.Y.U.

Daniel, MD, Editorial, Care of the Mentally\nIll in Prisons: Challenges and Solutions, 35 J. Am. Acad. Psychiatry & L. 406,\n409 (2007) (“A comprehensive review of national and international research\nclearly demonstrates that inmate suicide arises from a complex array\nof . . . self-reinforcing risk factors. . . . includ[ing] mental illness, substance\nabuse, prior serious suicide attempts, chronic stresses of incarceration . . .

Rev.\n497, 514 (2012) (noting that “there is a natural tension between providing inmates\nwith their mental health needs and their right to refuse treatment”), and Smith,\nsupra, at 517 (observing that “clinical assessment [of mental health] is subjective.\n. . . because the mental health assessment includes current symptoms that\nmanifest differently for different people”).\n\n      We recognize that, in at least one decision in the jail-suicide context, a\npanel of our court cited Tafoya and quoted its knowledge standard. See duBois v.\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         37\n\f      Thus, Ms. Cox had the burden of establishing that Sheriff Glanz possessed\n\nno less than this particularized mental state with respect to Mr. Jernegan. See\n\nGomez, 745 F.3d at 435 (noting that the supervisor’s state of mind “‘can be no\n\nless than the mens rea required’ of [any of his] subordinates to commit the\n\nunderlying constitutional violation.” (quoting Porro, 624 F.3d at 1328)). As\n\nnoted, Sheriff Glanz had no personal interaction with Mr. Jernegan or direct and\n\ncontemporaneous knowledge of his treatment in July 2009. Therefore, insofar as\n\nhe had knowledge sufficient to form the requisite mental state, it would have had\n\nto necessarily come from his subordinates. But, as demonstrated below, the\n\nrecord (even viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Cox) does not establish\n\nthat any identified Jail employee—including, notably, the two of central concern\n\nto Ms. Cox, namely, Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson—had knowledge that Mr.\n\nJernegan presented a substantial risk of suicide. It follows ineluctably then that\n\nSheriff Glanz could not have possessed such knowledge.\n\n      11\n         (...continued)\nPayne Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs, 543 F. App’x 841, 846 (10th Cir. 2013).\nHowever, even if it could be said that duBois embraced the Tafoya standard, we\nof course would not be bound by it, given its nonprecedential status and the fact\nthat it was decided after July 2009. But we do not believe in any event that\nduBois could be read in this manner. Notably the panel there also cited Hocker\nand Barrie, see duBois, 543 F. App’x at 846, and when the time arrived to apply\nthe law to the facts, the panel clearly relied on the mental state as established in\nthose authorities in concluding that the sheriff and the jail administrator could not\nbe held individually liable under the Eighth Amendment for deliberate\nindifference, see id. at 848 (noting that there was no evidence to “support the\nconclusion that [jail officials] knew, or should have known, of [the deceased\ninmate’s] condition”).\n\n                                         38\n\f                                          b\n\n      In determining whether Ms. Cox has carried her evidentiary burden on the\n\nculpable-mind issue, for the reasons noted supra, we necessarily focus on the\n\ninteractions of Sheriff Glanz’s subordinates with Mr. Jernegan. Ms. Cox’s\n\naverments center on two subordinates: Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson. See Aplee.\n\nBr. at 9 (“Plaintiff further argued that two of the individual health care\n\nprofessionals responsible for Mr. Jernegan’s care at the Jail, Faye Taylor . . . and\n\nSara Sampson . . . were deliberately indifferent to Mr. Jernegan’s serious mental\n\nhealth care needs.”). However, as demonstrated infra, the evidence does not\n\nindicate that either Ms. Taylor or Ms. Sampson possessed sufficient knowledge\n\nthat would permit them to conclude that Mr. Jernegan presented a substantial risk\n\nof suicide.\n\n      We first assess the quantum of knowledge of Ms. Taylor, who arguably\n\nspent more time communicating with Mr. Jernegan than any other named\n\ndefendant. Viewed in the aggregate, Ms. Taylor’s clinical findings led her to\n\nconclude that Mr. Jernegan was not suicidal. Mr. Jernegan was alert and\n\nconfident, and he exhibited a panoply of normal vital signs. When speaking to\n\nMs. Taylor, he maintained direct eye contact and behaved in an “appropriate”\n\nmanner, J.A. at 340 (Taylor Dep., dated Oct. 26, 2012)—while definitively telling\n\nher that he was not contemplating suicide, see id. at 349 (“[Mr. Jernegan] acted\n\nperfectly normal and he told me that he had never attempted suicide before. I\n\n                                         39\n\fbelieved him there. I asked if he was suicidal now. He said no.”). She duly\n\n“inform[ed] [him] that treatment was available if he was to need it.” Id. at 354.\n\nLater, Ms. Taylor recalled that she identified “nothing to act on” in terms of Mr.\n\nJernegan’s medical record except for his reported diagnosis of paranoid\n\nschizophrenia, id. at 342, though even then, he “gave [her] no indication that he\n\nwas having further treatment” for that claimed ailment, id. at 347. 12\n\n      Thus, based on the information Ms. Taylor obtained from speaking with\n\nand observing Mr. Jernegan, her recommendation of a “general population”\n\nassignment did not reflect deliberate indifference to Mr. Jernegan’s mental-health\n\n      12\n              By her own admission, Ms. Taylor was “not trained in mental\nhealth.” J.A. at 338. But the focus of our subjective inquiry under the deliberate-\nindifference standard is on what she actually knew. Before she could abate a\nsubstantial risk of suicide, she had to know about it. See Sealock v. Colorado,\n218 F.3d 1205, 1209 (10th Cir. 2000) (“The subjective component is met if a\nprison official ‘knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety.’” (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837)); see also Heidtke v. Corr. Corp. of\nAm., 489 F. App’x 275, 283 (10th Cir. 2012) (“Before a physician can abate a\nrisk, he must know of that risk.”). Ms. Taylor said that she elected not to refer\nMr. Jernegan to the mental-health team because he could not “give [her] any . . .\nparticulars” regarding his self-reported paranoid schizophrenia. J.A. at 348.\nPerhaps if Mr. Jernegan had provided Ms. Taylor with such particulars, she would\nhave possessed sufficient information to trigger an Eighth Amendment obligation\nto refer Mr. Jernegan for further mental-health evaluation. However, we will\nnever know because Mr. Jernegan did not provide Ms. Taylor with such\nparticulars. Nor is there any support in the record for the view that, absent such\ncommunications from Mr. Jernegan, his alleged substantial risk of suicide would\nhave been obvious to someone like Ms. Taylor, who lacked mental-health\ntraining. See Self v. Crum, 439 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir. 2006) (noting that “the\nsubjective component [of the deliberate-indifference standard] is not satisfied,\nabsent an extraordinary degree of neglect” and “[a] claim is therefore actionable\nonly in cases where the need for additional treatment or referral to a medical\nspecialist is obvious”).\n\n                                          40\n\fneeds and, more specifically, his risk of suicide. Altogether, under the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, it is pellucid that Ms. Taylor had no knowledge that Mr.\n\nJernegan presented a substantial risk of suicide. Consequently, Ms. Taylor could\n\nnot have formed the requisite state of mind that would constitute deliberate\n\nindifference.\n\n      Turning to Ms. Sampson, the mental-health employee apparently assigned\n\nto visit Mr. Jernegan on the morning of his death, we have even less information\n\nto evaluate with respect to her. The principal component of the record speaking\n\nto Ms. Sampson’s knowledge is her note in Mr. Jernegan’s file stating:\n\n“Attempted to see [inmate] but [inmate] had been re-located to J1 from F18. Plan\n\nto assess in J1.” Id. at 372. Presumably, Ms. Sampson was aware of the reason\n\nfor her visit—viz., Mr. Jernegan’s submission of a kiosk report claiming that he\n\nneeded to “spe[a]k with someone about problems,” id. at 362, and the subsequent\n\nstandard automated response, which served as notice that he had been placed on\n\nthe Jail’s mental-health call-out list. But these extremely vague data points miss\n\nthe mark for purposes of deliberate indifference. Nothing about the limited\n\ninformation to which Ms. Sampson was privy would have reasonably, much less\n\nobviously, conveyed to her that Mr. Jernegan presented a substantial risk of\n\nsuicide. See Self v. Crum, 439 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir. 2006) (“A claim is\n\ntherefore actionable only in cases where the need for additional treatment or\n\nreferral to a medical specialist is obvious.”); see also Sealock v. Colorado, 218\n\n                                         41\n\fF.3d 1205, 1209 (10th Cir. 2000). More specifically, because the parts of the\n\nrecord germane to Ms. Sampson’s knowledge indicate virtually nothing about the\n\nnature of Mr. Jernegan’s ostensible medical problem, they certainly could not\n\nsupport the conclusion that Ms. Sampson had knowledge that Mr. Jernegan posed\n\na substantial risk of suicide. For that reason, we reject Ms. Cox’s argument that\n\nMs. Sampson possessed the requisite mental state to constitute deliberate\n\nindifference.\n\n      In sum, Ms. Cox has not demonstrated that either Ms. Taylor or Ms.\n\nSampson had sufficient knowledge regarding Mr. Jernegan’s purported risk of\n\nsuicide to be found to have acted with deliberate indifference toward the risk.\n\nMr. Jernegan’s observable symptoms were susceptible to a number of\n\ninterpretations; suicide may well have been one possibility, but the facts known to\n\nthose with whom he interacted did not establish that it was a substantial one. Cf.\n\nHott v. Hennepin Cty., 260 F.3d 901, 906 (8th Cir. 2001) (noting, in a case where\n\nthe inmate denied suicidal ideation during booking, that “something more than an\n\ninmate’s gloomy affect is required to trigger a duty to inquire whether he is\n\nfeeling suicidal”); Estate of Novack ex rel. Turbin v. Cty. of Wood, 226 F.3d 525,\n\n530 (7th Cir. 2000) (noting, regarding an inmate who had been prescribed\n\nmedication for obvious psychiatric problems, that “strange behavior alone,\n\nwithout indications that that behavior has a substantial likelihood of taking a\n\nsuicidal turn,” could not give rise to deliberate-indifference liability). We cannot\n\n                                         42\n\fsay that Ms. Taylor—who directly interacted with Mr. Jernegan—understood Mr.\n\nJernegan to be an inmate who presented a substantial risk of suicide. We likewise\n\ncannot say that Ms. Sampson possessed that particularized knowledge regarding\n\nMr. Jernegan—especially given that, on Ms. Cox’s version of the facts, Ms.\n\nSampson never directly interacted with Mr. Jernegan. In sum, we cannot say that\n\nthese two Jail employees possessed the kind of knowledge that, under controlling\n\ncircuit precedent, could form the basis of a deliberate-indifference claim in the\n\njail-suicide context.\n\n      At bottom, when confronting individual-capacity § 1983 claims, our “focus\n\nmust always be on the defendant—on the . . . injury he inflicted or caused to be\n\ninflicted, and on his motives. This is because § 1983 isn’t a strict liability\n\noffense.” Porro, 624 F.3d at 1327. As noted, Sheriff Glanz had no personal\n\ninteraction with Mr. Jernegan or direct and contemporaneous knowledge of his\n\ntreatment in July 2009. Therefore, insofar as he had knowledge sufficient to form\n\nthe requisite mental state, it would have had to necessarily come from his\n\nsubordinates, notably Ms. Taylor or Ms. Sampson. Because they did not possess\n\nsuch knowledge, the conclusion inexorably follows that Sheriff Glanz could not\n\nhave possessed such knowledge. Accordingly, though we have not ignored Ms.\n\nCox’s strong assertions regarding the systemic failings of the Jail’s mental-health\n\nscreening and treatment protocols, which quite understandably troubled the\n\ndistrict court, we conclude that Ms. Cox has nevertheless failed to establish that\n\n                                          43\n\fSheriff Glanz acted as to Mr. Jernegan with the requisite mental state to constitute\n\ndeliberate indifference. In other words, she has not carried her burden regarding\n\nthe essential subjective component of the deliberate-indifference standard.\n\n      In sum, for the reasons stated, we cannot conclude that Sheriff Glanz’s\n\nconduct constituted an Eighth Amendment violation under the law that was\n\nclearly established at the time of Mr. Jernegan’s death. Therefore, Ms. Cox\n\ncannot satisfy the clearly-established-law component of the qualified-immunity\n\nstandard. We must accordingly reverse the district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity to the Sheriff on Ms. Cox’s individual-capacity claim under § 1983.\n\n                                          B\n\n      Next, Sheriff Glanz challenges the district court’s denial of summary\n\njudgment to him on Ms. Cox’s official-capacity § 1983 claim. This species of\n\nclaim “represent[s] only another way of pleading an action against an entity of\n\nwhich an officer is an agent.” Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690\n\nn.55 (1978). Under Monell, a local governmental unit such as a municipality or a\n\ncounty, like Tulsa County, “is a ‘person’ subject to § 1983 liability,” McDonald v.\n\nWise, 769 F.3d 1202, 1215 (10th Cir. 2014), and a “suit against Sheriff [Glanz] in\n\nhis official capacity as sheriff is the equivalent of a suit against [Tulsa] County,”\n\nLopez, 172 F.3d at 762.\n\n      On appeal, Sheriff Glanz contends that the district court “erred when it\n\ndenied [his] Motion for Summary Judgment because [his official] policies,\n\n                                          44\n\fpatterns or practices . . . were not the moving force behind any alleged\n\nconstitutional deprivation of Mr. Jernegan.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 4; see City of\n\nCanton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989) (holding that a county “can be liable\n\nunder § 1983 only where its policies are the ‘moving force [behind] the\n\nconstitutional violation’” (alteration in original) (citations omitted)). The Sheriff\n\nlikewise argues that the court “erred when it denied [his] Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment on . . . institutional liability in the absence of any underlying\n\n[constitutional] violation.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 5; see City of Canton, 489 U.S.\n\nat 395 (noting that imposing official-capacity § 1983 liability is not appropriate\n\n“absent . . . a very close causal connection to [some] violation of constitutional\n\nrights”). He consequently presents for our review arguments concerning the\n\noverarching policymaking and policy-implementation procedures of the county,\n\nwhich are typically focal points in an official-capacity-liability inquiry. As we\n\nhave specifically explained, this type of claim requires “the plaintiff [to] prove\n\n(1) the entity executed a policy or custom (2) that caused the plaintiff to suffer\n\ndeprivation of constitutional or other federal rights.” Moss v. Kopp, 559 F.3d\n\n1155, 1168 (10th Cir. 2009); see also Whitesel v. Sengenberger, 222 F.3d 861,\n\n870 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\n      All of the foregoing considerations aside, however, Sheriff Glanz faces a\n\nproblem that necessarily precedes any inquiry concerning Tulsa County’s\n\npolicymaking apparatus or the commission vel non of a constitutional violation.\n\n                                         45\n\fThat problem stems from the fact that his appeal is interlocutory—and, although\n\n(as discussed at some length supra) an interlocutory appeal is proper under\n\ncertain circumstances from a district court’s denial of qualified immunity, see\n\nFancher, 723 F.3d at 1198–99, “[n]o such right of appeal applies to [a county’s]\n\nappeal” from the denial of summary judgment, Walter v. Morton, 33 F.3d 1240,\n\n1242 (10th Cir. 1994). The reason for this distinction is that “[t]he denial of a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, unrelated to qualified immunity, is not a final\n\naction.” Walter, 33 F.3d at 1242 (emphasis added); see also Lynch v. Barrett, 703\n\nF.3d 1153, 1163 (10th Cir. 2013) (noting that a court’s denial of a local\n\ngovernmental entity’s “standard motion for summary judgment[,]. . . . a motion\n\nwhich raised a ‘mere defense to liability[,]’ . . . does not constitute a final\n\ndecision under § 1291 and is not appealable as such” (quoting Swint v. Chambers\n\nCty. Comm’n, 514 U.S. 35, 43 (1995))). Further, under well-settled precedent,\n\nordinarily an official-capacity defendant—who is not entitled to rely upon\n\nqualified immunity, see Beedle v. Wilson, 422 F.3d 1059, 1069 (10th Cir.\n\n2005)—cannot pursue an interlocutory appeal as a matter of right, because he\n\n“cannot invoke the collateral order doctrine to justify appeal of an otherwise\n\nnonappealable decision,” Moore v. City of Wynnewood, 57 F.3d 924, 929 (10th\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n      Nonetheless, “[w]e have previously recognized the doctrine of pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction, under which we exercise jurisdiction over an otherwise\n\n                                           46\n\fnonfinal and nonappealable lower court decision that overlaps with an appealable\n\ndecision.” Moore, 57 F.3d at 929; accord Crowe & Dunlevy, P.C. v. Stidham, 640\n\nF.3d 1140, 1148 (10th Cir. 2011). The doctrine is “discretionary, [and] the\n\nexercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction ‘is generally disfavored.’” Armijo ex\n\nrel. Chavez v. Wagon Mound Pub. Sch., 159 F.3d 1253, 1264 (10th Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting Moore, 57 F.3d at 929); accord Timpanogos Tribe v. Conway, 286 F.3d\n\n1195, 1200 (10th Cir. 2002); see also Bryson v. Gonzales, 534 F.3d 1282,\n\n1285–86 (10th Cir. 2008) (“Pendent appellate jurisdiction is . . . disfavored in the\n\nqualified immunity context.”).\n\n      As the Supreme Court has suggested, our discretionary exercise of pendent\n\njurisdiction over an otherwise unappealable (i.e., pendent) claim “may be\n\nappropriate where a district court’s decision on a pendent claim was ‘inextricably\n\nintertwined’ with the district court’s decision on a non-pendent claim, or ‘where\n\n[appellate] review of the former [is] necessary to ensure meaningful review of the\n\nlatter.’” Crowe & Dunlevy, 640 F.3d at 1148 (alterations in original) (quoting\n\nSwint, 514 U.S. at 51). We exercise this discretionary authority sparingly, see\n\nMoore, 57 F.3d at 930 (characterizing Swint as a “narrow avenue for the\n\ncontinued use of pendent appellate jurisdiction left open by” the Supreme Court),\n\nand “[w]e have interpreted Swint to mean that the exercise of our pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction is only appropriate [1] when ‘the otherwise nonappealable\n\ndecision is inextricably intertwined with the appealable decision, or [2] where\n\n                                         47\n\freview of the nonappealable decision is necessary to ensure meaningful review of\n\nthe appealable one,’” Crowe & Dunlevy, 640 F.3d at 1148 (quoting Tarrant Reg’l\n\nWater Dist. v. Sevenoaks, 545 F.3d 906, 915 (10th Cir. 2008)). Further, “[t]o be\n\ninextricably intertwined, . . . the pendent claim must be ‘coterminous with, or\n\nsubsumed in,’ the claim properly before the court.” Lee v. Nicholl, 197 F.3d\n\n1291, 1297 (10th Cir. 1999) (quoting Moore, 57 F.3d at 929).\n\n      Sheriff Glanz has not asked us to exercise our discretion to assume pendent\n\njurisdiction over the official-capacity claim in this interlocutory appeal, and we\n\n“will not make arguments for [him] that [he] did not make in [his appellate]\n\nbriefs.” O’Neal v. Ferguson Constr. Co., 237 F.3d 1248, 1257 n.1 (10th Cir.\n\n2001). But quite apart from that failing, we harbor grave doubt as to the propriety\n\nof exercising pendent jurisdiction over this claim. In other words, we question\n\nwhether either of the two accepted rationales for exercising pendent appellate\n\njurisdiction could be established here—i.e., interrelatedness of claims or the need\n\nto ensure meaningful review of a properly appealable claim.\n\n      First, we strongly doubt that Ms. Cox’s pendent (i.e., official-capacity) and\n\nnon-pendent (i.e., individual-capacity) claims are interrelated. We generally will\n\nallow “a suit [against the county] to proceed when immunity [based on a lack of\n\nclearly established law] shields the individual defendants.” Lynch, 703 F.3d at\n\n1164 (second alteration in original) (quoting Watson v. City of Kan. City, 857\n\nF.2d 690, 697 (10th Cir. 1988)). This is because, as we suggested in Moore,\n\n                                         48\n\fwhen we resolve an individual-capacity § 1983 claim on the clearly-established-\n\nlaw prong of qualified immunity, our analysis often, as a matter of law, does not\n\nturn on issues inextricably intertwined with those implicated by an official-\n\ncapacity claim arising out of the same facts. See 57 F.3d at 930 (“[T]he\n\n[governmental entity’s] appeal might present different issues than [the individual\n\ndefendant’s] appeal if we conclude[] that . . . [the individual defendant] was\n\nprotected by qualified immunity because th[e plaintiff’s constitutional] rights\n\nwere not clearly established.”); see also Lynch, 703 F.3d at 1163–64 (“Moore\n\ntells us that if we had held in this case that Defendant Officers’ conduct did not\n\nviolate Plaintiff’s constitutional right . . . , that holding would have resolved any\n\nissue presented by Defendant City’s appeal. . . . But because we assumed\n\nDefendant Officers violated Plaintiff’s right . . . and held they were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity based on the lack of clearly established law, Defendant City’s\n\nappeal i[s] not ‘inextricably intertwined’ with Defendant Officer’s appeal.”\n\n(citations omitted)). Stated otherwise, even if the Sheriff had sought pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction, we would be inclined to reject his request on the ground\n\nthat determining his entitlement vel non to qualified immunity here implicates an\n\nissue distinguishable from the official-capacity inquiry. And that specific\n\nqualified-immunity issue, as discussed supra, is whether the challenged conduct\n\nconstituted an Eighth Amendment violation under clearly established law existing\n\nin July 2009.\n\n                                          49\n\f      Additionally, we can undertake—indeed we have undertaken in Part III.A,\n\nsupra—a meaningful analysis of Sheriff Glanz’s appeal from the denial of\n\nqualified immunity (i.e., the non-pendent claim) without exercising pendent\n\njurisdiction over the official-capacity claim. Our determination that Sheriff Glanz\n\nis entitled to qualified immunity on the individual-capacity § 1983 claim, as we\n\nhave discussed at length, turns on whether Sheriff Glanz’s conduct and that of his\n\nidentified subordinates with respect to Mr. Jernegan constituted an Eighth\n\nAmendment deliberate-indifference violation under then-extant clearly\n\nestablished law. We were not required to decide the core issues implicated in the\n\nofficial-capacity § 1983 claim, which include whether, under our current law,\n\nthat challenged conduct as regards Mr. Jernegan gave rise to an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation. Therefore, as shown from our analysis supra, we have\n\ngrave doubt that there would be any appropriate basis for our exercise of pendent\n\njurisdiction over the official-capacity claim.\n\n      Ultimately, under our controlling circuit precedent, “[t]here is nothing\n\nanomalous about allowing . . . a suit [against an official defendant] to proceed\n\nwhen immunity [based on a lack of clearly established law] shields the individual\n\ndefendants.” Lynch, 703 F.3d at 1164 (third alteration in original) (omission in\n\noriginal) (quoting Watson, 857 F.2d at 697). The foregoing applies with equal\n\nforce to this appeal: Sheriff Glanz does not ask us to exercise pendent appellate\n\njurisdiction over the official-capacity claim, and we perceive no reasoned basis to\n\n                                          50\n\fdo so sua sponte. As a result, “[n]othing at this point prevents [Ms. Cox’s] claim\n\nagainst [the Sheriff in his official capacity] from proceeding.” Id. We thus\n\ndecline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over Ms. Cox’s official-capacity claim.\n\nAnd, because the pendent-jurisdiction doctrine is the only legally cognizable\n\njurisdictional foothold for this claim, we are constrained to dismiss this aspect of\n\nthe Sheriff’s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 13\n\n\n\n\n      13\n             In our view, Sheriff Glanz is not situated to claim any unfairness\nassociated with our determination that we lack jurisdiction to review the district\ncourt’s resolution of Ms. Cox’s official-capacity claim. As discussed supra, the\nSheriff confined his appellate briefing to the issue of whether any alleged\nconstitutional right would have been clearly established at the time Mr. Jernegan\ncommitted suicide, and we have honored his strategic choice in assessing the\nmerits of this appeal. One consequence of this choice, however, is the creation of\na disconnect between the individual-capacity and official-capacity claims that\nrenders these claims’ core issues distinguishable. And this disconnect,\noccasioned by the Sheriff’s own presentation of his appellate arguments, sounds\nthe death knell for the official-capacity aspect of his appeal, which we ultimately\ndismiss.\n\n       Morever, although Ms. Cox does not contend that Sheriff Glanz cannot\nproperly avail himself of the pendent-jurisdiction doctrine to interlocutorily\nappeal from the district court’s denial of summary judgment on her official-\ncapacity claim, it is clear that her silence on the matter is of no moment. See,\ne.g., United States v. Battles, 745 F.3d 436, 447 (10th Cir.)

Fortney of Brewster & De Angelis, P.L.L.C., Tulsa, Oklahoma (Clark O.\nBrewster and Corbin C. Brewster of Brewster & De Angelis, P.L.L.C., Tulsa,\nOklahoma, with him on the briefs), for Defendant-Appellant.\n\n\nBefore BRISCOE, Chief Judge, HOLMES and BACHARACH, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nHOLMES, Circuit Judge.\n\f      After Charles Jernegan committed suicide at the David L. Moss Criminal\n\nJustice Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma (“Jail”), his mother, Plaintiff-Appellee Carolyn\n\nCox, commenced this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against Defendant-Appellant\n\nStanley Glanz, the Tulsa County Sheriff (“Sheriff Glanz” or “the Sheriff”). Ms.\n\nCox sought to hold Sheriff Glanz liable for Mr. Jernegan’s suicide in his\n\nindividual capacity (relying upon a supervisory-liability theory) and in his official\n\ncapacity. Regarding both capacities, she alleged Eighth Amendment violations.\n\nSheriff Glanz moved for summary judgment, asserting the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity. The district court issued a ruling in which it denied the Sheriff’s\n\nmotion in all respects—albeit without mentioning qualified immunity—based on\n\nthe existence of genuinely disputed material facts.\n\n      In this interlocutory appeal, Sheriff Glanz contends that extant caselaw at\n\nthe time of Mr. Jernegan’s suicide did not clearly establish that he could be held\n\nliable as a supervisor under the circumstances present here—put succinctly, where\n\nMr. Jernegan denied having a suicidal intent during booking and no Jail staff\n\nmembers detected a basis for referring him for additional mental-health screening\n\nbased on their interactions with him. Accordingly, the Sheriff reasons that this\n\ndearth of clearly established law means that the district court erred in (tacitly)\n\ndenying him qualified immunity. The Sheriff also asserts that none of the\n\npolicies or procedures he has implemented at the Jail can be characterized as the\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fmoving force behind any alleged violation of Mr. Jernegan’s constitutional rights;\n\nconsequently, he says, there is no basis for official liability.\n\n         For ease of reference, we briefly summarize the conclusions of our ensuing\n\ndetailed analysis. First, we agree with Sheriff Glanz that reversal on Ms. Cox’s\n\nindividual-capacity claim is justified here and that the case must be remanded to\n\nthe district court. We specifically base our decision to reverse on our\n\ndetermination infra that the then-extant clearly established law would not have\n\nput a jail administrator similarly situated to Sheriff Glanz on notice that he could\n\nbe held liable under § 1983 for an Eighth Amendment violation based on a\n\nprisoner’s suicide where, as here, neither he nor any identified staff member\n\nwhom he supervised possessed knowledge that the particular inmate who\n\ncommitted suicide presented a substantial risk of taking his own life. Absent such\n\nknowledge, under then-extant clearly established law, the conduct of neither\n\nSheriff Glanz nor his identified subordinates with respect to a particular\n\nprisoner—here, Mr. Jernegan—could give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\nConsequently, Ms. Cox cannot perforce make the requisite showing under the\n\nclearly-established-law component of the well-settled qualified-immunity\n\nstandard. We thus reverse the district court’s summary-judgment decision\n\ndenying qualified immunity to Sheriff Glanz on Ms. Cox’s individual-capacity\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f      As for Ms. Cox’s official-capacity claim against Sheriff Glanz, however,\n\nwe confront the threshold issue of whether the exercise of our appellate\n\njurisdiction is proper. This is so because the district court’s denial of the motion\n\nfor summary judgment brought by the Sheriff in his official capacity is\n\nindisputably not a final decision amenable to interlocutory review. Our\n\nassumption of jurisdiction over the court’s resolution of the official-capacity\n\nclaim would therefore only be appropriate if we invoked our discretionary power\n\nto exercise pendent jurisdiction over this claim. Sheriff Glanz, however, has not\n\nrelied upon this generally disfavored doctrine; furthermore, we discern no legally\n\ncognizable basis for exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction under the\n\ncircumstances of this case. Accordingly, we dismiss Sheriff Glanz’s appeal from\n\nthe district court’s denial of summary judgment on the official-capacity claim for\n\nlack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                          A\n\n      Mr. Jernegan surrendered at the Jail on July 27, 2009, on an outstanding\n\nwarrant. He was immediately arrested and processed into the facility. As part of\n\nthe Jail’s routine intake screening, the booking officer asked Mr. Jernegan\n\nwhether he “[was] under psychiatric or a general Doctor’s care”; “[was] currently\n\ntaking any prescription medications”; “[had] been seen or treated in a clinic,\n\nhospital or emergency room in the last 3 days”; or was suicidal. J.A. at 326\n\n                                          4\n\f(Intake Screening Form, dated July 27, 2009). Mr. Jernegan answered “no” to\n\neach of these questions, id., and he indicated that he was not “currently thinking\n\nof committing suicide” on another intake form, id. at 327 (Gen. Info. Form, dated\n\nJuly 27, 2009) (reflecting that option “N,” for “no,” is marked directly above Mr.\n\nJernegan’s signature).\n\n      The booking officer also completed a more tailored form with questions\n\ndesigned to gauge an inmate’s mental health. Mr. Jernegan answered the form’s\n\nsix questions as follows:\n\n             1.      Do you currently feel paranoid, hear voices that others do\n                     not hear or see things that others do not see? [marked\n                     “Yes”]\n             2.      Have there currently been a few weeks when you felt\n                     nervous or depressed? [marked “Yes”]\n             3.      Have you ever tried to kill yourself? [marked “No”]\n             4.      Are you now thinking about hurting or killing yourself?\n                     [marked “No”]\n             5.      Are you currently taking any medication prescribed for\n                     you by a physician for any emotional or mental health\n                     problems? [marked “Yes”]\n             6.      Have you ever been in a hospital for emotional or mental\n                     health problems? [marked “No”]\n\nId. at 329 (Mental Health Form, dated July 27, 2009). An explanatory note\n\n“Diag. Paranoid-Schizo” accompanies Mr. Jernegan’s “[y]es” response to\n\nQuestion Five. Id.\n\n      This mental-health form indicated that further assessment should take place\n\nif, inter alia, an inmate answered “[y]es” to Question Five or Six, or if he\n\nanswered “[y]es” to at least two of Questions One through Four. Mr. Jernegan’s\n\n                                           5\n\fanswers satisfied both criteria: that is, he answered “[y]es” to Question Five,\n\nrepresenting that he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and he\n\nanswered “[y]es” to Questions One and Two. However, there is no indication in\n\nthe record that any Jail employee referred Mr. Jernegan to the facility’s mental-\n\nhealth team for follow-up care.\n\n      Nurse Faye Taylor also performed a medical examination, using her own\n\npersonal screening form. On that document, she noted Mr. Jernegan’s\n\nrepresentations to her that he had “had mental health treatment or hospitalization”\n\nfor paranoid schizophrenia, that he had smoked marijuana, and that he was not\n\nsuicidal. Id. at 603 (Healthcare Intake Screening Form, dated July 27, 2009).\n\nMs. Taylor observed that Mr. Jernegan had regular vital signs and that he\n\nappeared normal and alert. She did not mark the “[r]eferral to health care\n\nfacility” or “[r]eferral to provider” options on her form. Id. On the basis of these\n\nfindings, Ms. Taylor recommended that Mr. Jernegan be assigned to the Jail’s\n\ngeneral population.\n\n      At 12:18 p.m. the next day (July 28, 2009), Mr. Jernegan filed a medical\n\nrequest through the Jail’s computer “kiosk” communication system to report that\n\nhe needed to “spe[a]k with someone about problems.” Id. at 362 (Request, dated\n\nJuly 28, 2009) (capitalization altered). He received an automated response the\n\nday after that (July 29, 2009) at 10:07 a.m.; it said, “[y]ou will be place[d] on the\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fMental Health call out list for . . . July 30, 2009. Please give 48–72 hours from\n\n[the] time this was received to be seen, excluding Weekends and Holidays.” Id.\n\n      Mr. Jernegan’s Jail medical record revealed another relevant entry: a\n\n“Problem Oriented Record” entry dated July 30, 2009, at 8:00 a.m., which notes\n\nthat healthcare employee Sara Sampson “[a]ttempted to see” Mr. Jernegan but\n\nlearned that he had been moved to a different cellblock. Id. at 372 (Problem\n\nOriented Record, dated July 30, 2009) (capitalization altered). Although the\n\nrecord does not confirm that Ms. Sampson actually visited Mr. Jernegan,\n\nsupervising officers were apparently “satisfied that Sampson had performed her\n\njob as expected.” Id. at 659 (Incident Report, dated Aug. 3, 2009).\n\n      Shortly thereafter, at approximately 9:25 a.m. (on July 30), Nurses Robin\n\nMason and Sara Jeffries were summoned to Mr. Jernegan’s cellblock, having been\n\ninformed that an inmate had hanged himself. When they arrived, they found Mr.\n\nJernegan “still hanging from a make-shift noose and being cut down by detention\n\nstaff.” Id. at 468 (Mason Aff., dated Mar. 22, 2013). Mr. Jernegan had no\n\npalpable pulse and did not respond to resuscitative measures. He was\n\nsubsequently pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\n      After reviewing Mr. Jernegan’s file, Ms. Mason “became suspicious”\n\nregarding the follow-up to his kiosk request. Id. More specifically, she was not\n\nconfident of the truth of Ms. Sampson’s purported visit to Mr. Jernegan because:\n\n(1) she “had never seen any member of the mental health team at the Jail as early\n\n                                          7\n\fas 8:00[ a.m.]”; (2) she had witnessed efforts by Ms. Sampson and other members\n\nof the mental-health team to “mak[e] sure to have consistent stories” about Mr.\n\nJernegan’s treatment; and (3) she “had previous experience in witnessing the\n\nfalsification of records and reports at the Jail.” Id. at 468–69. It was also\n\ndisconcerting to Ms. Mason that the Jail’s intake nurses’ apparent practice was to\n\nrefer only “acutely suicidal” inmates to the mental-health team for additional\n\nevaluation. Id. at 470.\n\n      The Oklahoma State Department of Health (“OSDH”) conducted an\n\ninvestigation and determined that Mr. Jernegan was not examined by any member\n\nof the Jail’s mental-health team in the time period between the filing of his kiosk\n\nreport and his death. It issued a report attributing three particular deficiencies to\n\nthe Jail relative to Mr. Jernegan’s suicide: (1) “inmate not properly detained”; (2)\n\n“inmate not housed in an area for more frequent observations” / “inappropriate\n\nmedical evaluation”; and (3) “policy used by correctional healthcare management\n\nin direct conflict with the [Oklahoma] Jail Standards.” Id. at 625 (Report of\n\nDeath Investigation, dated Aug. 3, 2009) (capitalization altered). The OSDH then\n\nfiled a “Notice of Violation” documenting the Jail’s failure to satisfy three of the\n\nOklahoma Jail Standards (“Standards”).\n\n      With regard to the Jail’s particular violations, the OSDH first cited\n\nStandard 5-5(6), which provides: “Prisoners who are mentally ill shall be\n\nseparated from other prisoners. Every effort shall be made to contact a local\n\n                                           8\n\fhospital, clinic or mental health facility for the detention of the mentally ill.”\n\nOkla. Admin. Code § 310:670-5-5(6). The OSDH found the Jail in violation of\n\nthat standard “because [Mr. Jernegan] was not properly segregated.” J.A. at 631\n\n(Notice of Violation, dated Aug. 12, 2009). Second, the OSDH deemed the Jail’s\n\nmedical policies in “direct conflict,” id., with Standard 5-8, which obligates\n\ncorrectional facilities to provide “[a]dequate medical care” and to “develop and\n\nimplement written policies and procedures for complete emergency medical and\n\nhealth care services,” Okla. Admin. Code § 310:670-5-8.\n\n      And, third, the OSDH referenced Standard 5-8(2), which instructs:\n\n             Medical triage screening shall be performed on all prisoners\n             immediately upon admission to the facility and before being\n             placed in the general population or housing area. Those\n             individuals who appear to have a significant medical or\n             psychiatric problem, or who may be a suicide risk, shall be\n             transported to the supporting medical facility as soon as possible.\n             They shall be housed separately in a location where they can be\n             observed frequently by the staff at least until the appropriate\n             medical evaluation has been completed. . . . [A]fter stringent\n             evaluation by the highest-ranking mental health professional, in\n             conjunction with a senior detention supervisor, these prisoners\n             may be authorized to share the same cell.\n\nId. § 310:670-5-8(2). The OSDH found that the Jail contravened Standard 5-8(2)\n\n“because [Mr. Jernegan] was not housed in an area for more frequent\n\nobservations” and because the Jail conducted an “[i]nappropriate medical\n\nevaluation.” J.A. at 632.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                                           B\n\n                                           1\n\n      Ms. Cox commenced the instant litigation in 2011. In the operative version\n\nof her complaint, she asserted claims against Sheriff Glanz, the company that\n\nprovided healthcare services to the Jail, and several of the Jail’s healthcare\n\nemployees, including Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson. As relevant to this appeal,\n\nMs. Cox sued the Sheriff in his individual and official capacities pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging that his failure to provide adequate and timely mental-\n\nhealth screening and care constituted deliberate indifference to Mr. Jernegan’s\n\nserious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ms. Cox averred\n\nthat “Mr. Jernegan had a substantial and documented history of serious mental\n\nillness” at the Jail and, in light of this history, she asserted that the Sheriff and his\n\nstaff should have perceived “a strong likelihood that Mr. Jernegan was in danger\n\nof serious personal harm.” J.A. at 47 (Second Am. Compl., filed Apr. 4, 2012).\n\n      On the individual-capacity claim, Ms. Cox asserted a supervisory-liability\n\ntheory grounded in the Sheriff’s alleged failure to properly train and supervise\n\nJail employees such as Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson. On the official-capacity\n\nclaim, she stated that the Sheriff had promulgated and administered an\n\nunconstitutional policy of providing insufficient mental-health evaluation and\n\ntreatment—a policy that ultimately resulted in Mr. Jernegan’s death.\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f      Sheriff Glanz moved for summary judgment, contending that he was\n\nentitled to qualified immunity on the individual-capacity claim1 because Ms. Cox\n\nhad not established that: (1) any Jail employee had acted with deliberate\n\nindifference toward Mr. Jernegan’s serious medical needs; (2) he, as the Jail\n\nadministrator, had acted with the requisite state of mind to support a deliberate-\n\nindifference claim; and (3) he had created any policy that produced the\n\ncomplained-of constitutional harm. He framed his qualified-immunity arguments\n\nin terms of Ms. Cox’s purported failure to suitably establish a violation of a\n\nconstitutional right. Similarly, in rebutting the official-capacity claim, the Sheriff\n\nargued that Ms. Cox had not shown that any of the Jail policies he administered\n\nhad violated Mr. Jernegan’s constitutional rights.\n\n      Ms. Cox responded to the Sheriff’s assertion of qualified immunity in\n\nsimilar fashion—i.e., by focusing on whether a constitutional violation had\n\noccurred. She opined that her claims “raised bedrock constitutional Eighth\n\nAmendment . . . principles that appl[ied] with obvious clarity to the conduct in\n\nquestion.” Id. at 444 (Pl.’s Resp. Br., filed Apr. 3, 2013). In particular, Ms. Cox\n\nalleged that Mr. Jernegan’s constitutional rights were violated when he was\n\n“assessed and treated by undertrained and unsupervised [Jail] staff.” Id. at 438.\n\n      1\n              The defense of qualified immunity “is available only in suits against\nofficials sued in their personal capacities, not in suits against . . . officials sued in\ntheir official capacities.” Starkey v.

He concluded that “he w[as] therefore\n\nqualifiedly immune.” Id. at 995. Sheriff Glanz did not go one step further and\n\nargue that there was no extant clearly established law supportive of Ms. Cox’s\n\nclaims; he was silent on this question.\n\n                                          2\n\n      On March 7, 2014, the district court issued an order denying Sheriff\n\nGlanz’s motion.

The court’s analysis was not consonant with our settled mode\n\nof qualified-immunity decisionmaking. Specifically, the court’s central focus was\n\non the existence vel non of genuinely disputed issues of material fact, and that\n\nfocus is counter to our established qualified-immunity approach. See Allstate\n\nSweeping, 706 F.3d at 1267.

Perhaps\n\nbecause it was set adrift by the deficiencies of the parties’ briefing, which are\n\nexplicated infra, the district court did not mention qualified immunity in its\n\nsummary-judgment order. However—critically, for purposes of our interlocutory\n\nreview—the court did explicitly deny Sheriff Glanz all relief in its order, and part\n\nof the relief that Sheriff Glanz unquestionably sought in his summary-judgment\n\nbriefing was qualified immunity. Consequently, the court effectively denied\n\nSheriff Glanz the defense of qualified immunity when it denied his summary-\n\njudgment motion. 5\n\n      5\n             Even if this were not so, our precedent would safeguard Sheriff\n                                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                          19\n\f      Ms. Cox nevertheless suggests that the court’s fact-based manner of\n\ndisposing of the defense divests us of jurisdiction to reach the qualified-immunity\n\nissue on appeal. We disagree. Notably, Sheriff Glanz has accepted the truth of\n\nMs. Cox’s version of the facts for purposes of this appeal. Under our controlling\n\ncaselaw (discussed supra), that ordinarily will permit us to address the legal\n\nissues presented by the agreed-upon set of facts, and there is nothing about this\n\ncase that would counsel against following that path. Cf. Castillo, 790 F.3d at\n\n1018 (“Although [Defendant] attempts to characterize the issue on appeal as\n\nPlaintiffs’ failure to assert a violation of a constitutional right under clearly\n\nestablished law, her argument is limited to a discussion of her version of the facts\n\nand the inferences that can be drawn therefrom. Thus, [Defendant’s] argument is\n\nactually a challenge to the district court’s conclusion Plaintiffs presented\n\nsufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.

In this regard, Sheriff Glanz’s\n\nbriefing was assuredly not robust. Therein, he vaguely asserted, regarding\n\nqualified immunity and in particular, the constitutional-violation question, that\n\nthe “materials presented in [his] Statement of Undisputed Facts . . . are direct\n\n                                          22\n\fevidence that [he] [wa]s not indifferent, deliberately or otherwise.” J.A. at 241\n\n(Mot. for Summ.

See, e.g., Castillo, 790 F.3d at 1019; Roosevelt-Hennix, 717 F.3d at\n\n753.\n\n        The forfeiture issue turns on the extent of Sheriff Glanz’s obligation to do\n\nmore than nominally raise the qualified-immunity defense—that is, it turns on\n\nwhether he was obliged to marshal particularized arguments in support of the\n\nclearly-established-law question, viz., specific arguments demonstrating that,\n\nunder then-extant clearly established law, neither he nor any of his identified\n\nsubordinates violated Mr. Jernegan’s Eighth Amendment rights. Even assuming\n\narguendo that he was required to do this, and therefore forfeited his clearly-\n\nestablished-law arguments by failing to do so, we cannot ignore, in deciding\n\nwhether to recognize the forfeiture, the unique briefing burdens of the nonmovant\n\nplaintiff in the qualified-immunity context, and Ms. Cox’s feeble efforts to bear\n\nthem.\n\n        Specifically, by asserting the qualified-immunity defense, Sheriff Glanz\n\ntriggered a well-settled twofold burden that Ms. Cox was compelled to shoulder:\n\nnot only did she need to rebut the Sheriff’s no-constitutional-violation arguments,\n\nbut she also had to demonstrate that any constitutional violation was grounded in\n\n                                          23\n\fthen-extant clearly established law.

For\n\nthe reasons discussed herein, we conclude that the district court committed one\n\nreversible error. Specifically, we determine that the court erred in denying\n\nqualified immunity to the Sheriff; accordingly, we reverse that aspect of the\n\ncourt’s judgment. However, we do not address the Sheriff’s second claim of error\n\n(i.e., regarding the denial of summary judgment on Ms. Cox’s official-capacity\n\nclaim)—not only do we lack jurisdiction to review this claim on interlocutory\n\nappeal, but we also decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over it.\n\nConsequently, we are constrained to dismiss the aspect of the Sheriff’s appeal\n\nconcerning liability in his official capacity.\n\n\n\n      7\n        (...continued)\npurely legal one: whether the facts alleged (by the plaintiff, or, in some cases, the\ndefendant) support a claim of violation of clearly established law”).

Nor, for that matter, has Ms. Cox attempted to shoulder her\n\nburden by showing that “the clearly established weight of authority from other\n\ncourts . . . ha[s] found the law to be as [she] maintains.” Becker, 709 F.3d at\n\n1023 (quoting Morris v.

In light of Taylor, our reading of the contours of the law a\n\nshort five years later should not be surprising. That is, irrespective of the alleged\n\n                                          35\n\fdeficiencies in the Jail’s suicide-screening protocols, in order for any defendant,\n\nincluding Sheriff Glanz, to be found to have acted with deliberate indifference, he\n\nneeded to first have knowledge that the specific inmate at issue presented a\n\nsubstantial risk of suicide.

However, our\nstudy strongly indicates that Tafoya is distinguishable and should not cause us to\nquestion the clear guidance of our cases decided in the jail-suicide context.\nSpecifically, while the risk of sexual assault at issue in Tafoya frequently may be\ndivined from a myriad of external factors—including, notably, the sexual\nvictimizer’s characteristics—a substantial risk of suicide may be impossible to\ndiscern unless the particular inmate reveals indicia of that risk to prison officials.\nCompare Cash v.

See duBois v.\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         37\n\f      Thus, Ms. Cox had the burden of establishing that Sheriff Glanz possessed\n\nno less than this particularized mental state with respect to Mr. Jernegan.

As\n\nnoted, Sheriff Glanz had no personal interaction with Mr. Jernegan or direct and\n\ncontemporaneous knowledge of his treatment in July 2009. Therefore, insofar as\n\nhe had knowledge sufficient to form the requisite mental state, it would have had\n\nto necessarily come from his subordinates. But, as demonstrated below, the\n\nrecord (even viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Cox) does not establish\n\nthat any identified Jail employee—including, notably, the two of central concern\n\nto Ms. Cox, namely, Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson—had knowledge that Mr.\n\nJernegan presented a substantial risk of suicide.

But we do not believe in any event that\nduBois could be read in this manner. Notably the panel there also cited Hocker\nand Barrie, see duBois, 543 F. App’x at 846, and when the time arrived to apply\nthe law to the facts, the panel clearly relied on the mental state as established in\nthose authorities in concluding that the sheriff and the jail administrator could not\nbe held individually liable under the Eighth Amendment for deliberate\nindifference, see id. at 848 (noting that there was no evidence to “support the\nconclusion that [jail officials] knew, or should have known, of [the deceased\ninmate’s] condition”).\n\n                                         38\n\f                                          b\n\n      In determining whether Ms. Cox has carried her evidentiary burden on the\n\nculpable-mind issue, for the reasons noted supra, we necessarily focus on the\n\ninteractions of Sheriff Glanz’s subordinates with Mr. Jernegan. Ms. Cox’s\n\naverments center on two subordinates: Ms. Taylor and Ms. Sampson. See Aplee.\n\nBr. at 9 (“Plaintiff further argued that two of the individual health care\n\nprofessionals responsible for Mr. Jernegan’s care at the Jail, Faye Taylor . . . and\n\nSara Sampson . . . were deliberately indifferent to Mr. Jernegan’s serious mental\n\nhealth care needs.”). However, as demonstrated infra, the evidence does not\n\nindicate that either Ms. Taylor or Ms. Sampson possessed sufficient knowledge\n\nthat would permit them to conclude that Mr. Jernegan presented a substantial risk\n\nof suicide.\n\n      We first assess the quantum of knowledge of Ms. Taylor, who arguably\n\nspent more time communicating with Mr. Jernegan than any other named\n\ndefendant. Viewed in the aggregate, Ms. Taylor’s clinical findings led her to\n\nconclude that Mr. Jernegan was not suicidal. Mr. Jernegan was alert and\n\nconfident, and he exhibited a panoply of normal vital signs. When speaking to\n\nMs. Taylor, he maintained direct eye contact and behaved in an “appropriate”\n\nmanner, J.A. at 340 (Taylor Dep., dated Oct. 26, 2012)—while definitively telling\n\nher that he was not contemplating suicide, see id. at 349 (“[Mr. Jernegan] acted\n\nperfectly normal and he told me that he had never attempted suicide before. I\n\n                                         39\n\fbelieved him there. I asked if he was suicidal now. He said no.”). She duly\n\n“inform[ed] [him] that treatment was available if he was to need it.” Id. at 354.\n\nLater, Ms. Taylor recalled that she identified “nothing to act on” in terms of Mr.\n\nJernegan’s medical record except for his reported diagnosis of paranoid\n\nschizophrenia, id. at 342, though even then, he “gave [her] no indication that he\n\nwas having further treatment” for that claimed ailment, id. at 347. 12\n\n      Thus, based on the information Ms. Taylor obtained from speaking with\n\nand observing Mr. Jernegan, her recommendation of a “general population”\n\nassignment did not reflect deliberate indifference to Mr. Jernegan’s mental-health\n\n      12\n              By her own admission, Ms. Taylor was “not trained in mental\nhealth.” J.A. at 338. But the focus of our subjective inquiry under the deliberate-\nindifference standard is on what she actually knew. Before she could abate a\nsubstantial risk of suicide, she had to know about it.

Colorado,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159878\"><a href=\"/opinion/159878/sealock-v-state-of-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1209 (10th Cir. 2000) (“The subjective component is met if a\nprison official ‘knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety.’” (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837)); see also Heidtke v. Corr. Corp. of\nAm., 489 F. App’x 275, 283 (10th Cir. 2012) (“Before a physician can abate a\nrisk, he must know of that risk.”). Ms. Taylor said that she elected not to refer\nMr. Jernegan to the mental-health team because he could not “give [her] any . . .\nparticulars” regarding his self-reported paranoid schizophrenia. J.A. at 348.\nPerhaps if Mr. Jernegan had provided Ms. Taylor with such particulars, she would\nhave possessed sufficient information to trigger an Eighth Amendment obligation\nto refer Mr. Jernegan for further mental-health evaluation. However, we will\nnever know because Mr. Jernegan did not provide Ms. Taylor with such\nparticulars. Nor is there any support in the record for the view that, absent such\ncommunications from Mr. Jernegan, his alleged substantial risk of suicide would\nhave been obvious to someone like Ms. Taylor, who lacked mental-health\ntraining. See Self v. Crum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167169\"><a href=\"/opinion/167169/self-v-oliva/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1232 (10th Cir. 2006) (noting that “the\nsubjective component [of the deliberate-indifference standard] is not satisfied,\nabsent an extraordinary degree of neglect” and “[a] claim is therefore actionable\nonly in cases where the need for additional treatment or referral to a medical\nspecialist is obvious”).\n\n                                          40\n\fneeds and, more specifically, his risk of suicide. Altogether, under the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, it is pellucid that Ms. Taylor had no knowledge that Mr.\n\nJernegan presented a substantial risk of suicide. Consequently, Ms. Taylor could\n\nnot have formed the requisite state of mind that would constitute deliberate\n\nindifference.\n\n      Turning to Ms. Sampson, the mental-health employee apparently assigned\n\nto visit Mr. Jernegan on the morning of his death, we have even less information\n\nto evaluate with respect to her. The principal component of the record speaking\n\nto Ms. Sampson’s knowledge is her note in Mr. Jernegan’s file stating:\n\n“Attempted to see [inmate] but [inmate] had been re-located to J1 from F18. Plan\n\nto assess in J1.” Id. at 372. Presumably, Ms. Sampson was aware of the reason\n\nfor her visit—viz., Mr. Jernegan’s submission of a kiosk report claiming that he\n\nneeded to “spe[a]k with someone about problems,” id. at 362, and the subsequent\n\nstandard automated response, which served as notice that he had been placed on\n\nthe Jail’s mental-health call-out list. But these extremely vague data points miss\n\nthe mark for purposes of deliberate indifference. Nothing about the limited\n\ninformation to which Ms. Sampson was privy would have reasonably, much less\n\nobviously, conveyed to her that Mr. Jernegan presented a substantial risk of\n\nsuicide. See Self v. Crum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167169\"><a href=\"/opinion/167169/self-v-oliva/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1232 (10th Cir. 2006) (“A claim is\n\ntherefore actionable only in cases where the need for additional treatment or\n\nreferral to a medical specialist is obvious.”); see also Sealock v.

More specifically, because the parts of the\n\nrecord germane to Ms. Sampson’s knowledge indicate virtually nothing about the\n\nnature of Mr. Jernegan’s ostensible medical problem, they certainly could not\n\nsupport the conclusion that Ms. Sampson had knowledge that Mr. Jernegan posed\n\na substantial risk of suicide. For that reason, we reject Ms. Cox’s argument that\n\nMs. Sampson possessed the requisite mental state to constitute deliberate\n\nindifference.\n\n      In sum, Ms. Cox has not demonstrated that either Ms. Taylor or Ms.\n\nSampson had sufficient knowledge regarding Mr. Jernegan’s purported risk of\n\nsuicide to be found to have acted with deliberate indifference toward the risk.\n\nMr. Jernegan’s observable symptoms were susceptible to a number of\n\ninterpretations; suicide may well have been one possibility, but the facts known to\n\nthose with whom he interacted did not establish that it was a substantial one.

We cannot\n\n                                         42\n\fsay that Ms. Taylor—who directly interacted with Mr. Jernegan—understood Mr.\n\nJernegan to be an inmate who presented a substantial risk of suicide. We likewise\n\ncannot say that Ms. Sampson possessed that particularized knowledge regarding\n\nMr. Jernegan—especially given that, on Ms. Cox’s version of the facts, Ms.\n\nSampson never directly interacted with Mr. Jernegan. In sum, we cannot say that\n\nthese two Jail employees possessed the kind of knowledge that, under controlling\n\ncircuit precedent, could form the basis of a deliberate-indifference claim in the\n\njail-suicide context.\n\n      At bottom, when confronting individual-capacity § 1983 claims, our “focus\n\nmust always be on the defendant—on the . . . injury he inflicted or caused to be\n\ninflicted, and on his motives. This is because § 1983 isn’t a strict liability\n\noffense.” Porro, 624 F.3d at 1327. As noted, Sheriff Glanz had no personal\n\ninteraction with Mr. Jernegan or direct and contemporaneous knowledge of his\n\ntreatment in July 2009. Therefore, insofar as he had knowledge sufficient to form\n\nthe requisite mental state, it would have had to necessarily come from his\n\nsubordinates, notably Ms. Taylor or Ms. Sampson. Because they did not possess\n\nsuch knowledge, the conclusion inexorably follows that Sheriff Glanz could not\n\nhave possessed such knowledge. Accordingly, though we have not ignored Ms.\n\nCox’s strong assertions regarding the systemic failings of the Jail’s mental-health\n\nscreening and treatment protocols, which quite understandably troubled the\n\ndistrict court, we conclude that Ms. Cox has nevertheless failed to establish that\n\n                                          43\n\fSheriff Glanz acted as to Mr. Jernegan with the requisite mental state to constitute\n\ndeliberate indifference. In other words, she has not carried her burden regarding\n\nthe essential subjective component of the deliberate-indifference standard.\n\n      In sum, for the reasons stated, we cannot conclude that Sheriff Glanz’s\n\nconduct constituted an Eighth Amendment violation under the law that was\n\nclearly established at the time of Mr. Jernegan’s death. Therefore, Ms. Cox\n\ncannot satisfy the clearly-established-law component of the qualified-immunity\n\nstandard. We must accordingly reverse the district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity to the Sheriff on Ms. Cox’s individual-capacity claim under § 1983.\n\n                                          B\n\n      Next, Sheriff Glanz challenges the district court’s denial of summary\n\njudgment to him on Ms. Cox’s official-capacity § 1983 claim.

But quite apart from that failing, we harbor grave doubt as to the propriety\n\nof exercising pendent jurisdiction over this claim. In other words, we question\n\nwhether either of the two accepted rationales for exercising pendent appellate\n\njurisdiction could be established here—i.e., interrelatedness of claims or the need\n\nto ensure meaningful review of a properly appealable claim.\n\n      First, we strongly doubt that Ms. Cox’s pendent (i.e., official-capacity) and\n\nnon-pendent (i.e., individual-capacity) claims are interrelated. We generally will\n\nallow “a suit [against the county] to proceed when immunity [based on a lack of\n\nclearly established law] shields the individual defendants.” Lynch, 703 F.3d at\n\n1164 (second alteration in original) (quoting Watson v.

This is because, as we suggested in Moore,\n\n                                         48\n\fwhen we resolve an individual-capacity § 1983 claim on the clearly-established-\n\nlaw prong of qualified immunity, our analysis often, as a matter of law, does not\n\nturn on issues inextricably intertwined with those implicated by an official-\n\ncapacity claim arising out of the same facts. See 57 F.3d at 930 (“[T]he\n\n[governmental entity’s] appeal might present different issues than [the individual\n\ndefendant’s] appeal if we conclude[] that . . . [the individual defendant] was\n\nprotected by qualified immunity because th[e plaintiff’s constitutional] rights\n\nwere not clearly established.”); see also Lynch, 703 F.3d at 1163–64 (“Moore\n\ntells us that if we had held in this case that Defendant Officers’ conduct did not\n\nviolate Plaintiff’s constitutional right . . . , that holding would have resolved any\n\nissue presented by Defendant City’s appeal. . . . But because we assumed\n\nDefendant Officers violated Plaintiff’s right . . . and held they were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity based on the lack of clearly established law, Defendant City’s\n\nappeal i[s] not ‘inextricably intertwined’ with Defendant Officer’s appeal.”\n\n(citations omitted)). Stated otherwise, even if the Sheriff had sought pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction, we would be inclined to reject his request on the ground\n\nthat determining his entitlement vel non to qualified immunity here implicates an\n\nissue distinguishable from the official-capacity inquiry. And that specific\n\nqualified-immunity issue, as discussed supra, is whether the challenged conduct\n\nconstituted an Eighth Amendment violation under clearly established law existing\n\nin July 2009.\n\n                                          49\n\f      Additionally, we can undertake—indeed we have undertaken in Part III.A,\n\nsupra—a meaningful analysis of Sheriff Glanz’s appeal from the denial of\n\nqualified immunity (i.e., the non-pendent claim) without exercising pendent\n\njurisdiction over the official-capacity claim. Our determination that Sheriff Glanz\n\nis entitled to qualified immunity on the individual-capacity § 1983 claim, as we\n\nhave discussed at length, turns on whether Sheriff Glanz’s conduct and that of his\n\nidentified subordinates with respect to Mr. Jernegan constituted an Eighth\n\nAmendment deliberate-indifference violation under then-extant clearly\n\nestablished law. We were not required to decide the core issues implicated in the\n\nofficial-capacity § 1983 claim, which include whether, under our current law,\n\nthat challenged conduct as regards Mr. Jernegan gave rise to an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation. Therefore, as shown from our analysis supra, we have\n\ngrave doubt that there would be any appropriate basis for our exercise of pendent\n\njurisdiction over the official-capacity claim.\n\n      Ultimately, under our controlling circuit precedent, “[t]here is nothing\n\nanomalous about allowing . . . a suit [against an official defendant] to proceed\n\nwhen immunity [based on a lack of clearly established law] shields the individual\n\ndefendants.” Lynch, 703 F.3d at 1164 (third alteration in original) (omission in\n\noriginal) (quoting Watson, 857 F.2d at 697). The foregoing applies with equal\n\nforce to this appeal: Sheriff Glanz does not ask us to exercise pendent appellate\n\njurisdiction over the official-capacity claim, and we perceive no reasoned basis to\n\n                                          50\n\fdo so sua sponte. As a result, “[n]othing at this point prevents [Ms. Cox’s] claim\n\nagainst [the Sheriff in his official capacity] from proceeding.” Id. We thus\n\ndecline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over Ms. Cox’s official-capacity claim.\n\nAnd, because the pendent-jurisdiction doctrine is the only legally cognizable\n\njurisdictional foothold for this claim, we are constrained to dismiss this aspect of\n\nthe Sheriff’s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 13\n\n\n\n\n      13\n             In our view, Sheriff Glanz is not situated to claim any unfairness\nassociated with our determination that we lack jurisdiction to review the district\ncourt’s resolution of Ms. Cox’s official-capacity claim. As discussed supra, the\nSheriff confined his appellate briefing to the issue of whether any alleged\nconstitutional right would have been clearly established at the time Mr. Jernegan\ncommitted suicide, and we have honored his strategic choice in assessing the\nmerits of this appeal. One consequence of this choice, however, is the creation of\na disconnect between the individual-capacity and official-capacity claims that\nrenders these claims’ core issues distinguishable. And this disconnect,\noccasioned by the Sheriff’s own presentation of his appellate arguments, sounds\nthe death knell for the official-capacity aspect of his appeal, which we ultimately\ndismiss.\n\n       Morever, although Ms. Cox does not contend that Sheriff Glanz cannot\nproperly avail himself of the pendent-jurisdiction doctrine to interlocutorily\nappeal from the district court’s denial of summary judgment on her official-\ncapacity claim, it is clear that her silence on the matter is of no moment.
