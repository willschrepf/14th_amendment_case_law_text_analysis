City of Stanton (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1277\n(Madain I), we learn that this court’s concern, expressed in that opinion, about the city\nnot giving two competing applicants an “equal opportunity” to obtain permits to operate\nin a particular industrial-commercial section of the city (id. at p. 1290) turned out to be\nwell founded. After our decision, the matter was committed by the city itself to a retired\nappellate court justice from another district to make findings of fact on the issue of which\nof the two applicants really applied first. The retired justice determined that plaintiff\nMusa Madain had effectively joined the queue before the competing applicant, the\nBranches Christian Church. The retired justice further found the city had manipulated its\n“sensitive use” ordinance to give priority to the church over Madain, who proposed to\nopen an adult entertainment business. After the retired justice’s decision, plaintiff\nMadain was indeed able to obtain his sought-after permit, but only after a year of\nbureaucratic delay and nit-picking. This appeal centers on Madain’s quest for damages\nresulting from the delays he encountered on the way to success in obtaining his permit.\n              We arrive at a variegated decision on the two appeals before us. The first\nappeal arises out of the very same trial court action that came to us in Madain I, trial\ncourt docket number 30-2009-00119013, our docket number G047717. Technically, this\nfirst appeal is from an order denying Madain’s motion to amend his original petition filed\nin Madain I. It must be dismissed because, as the city correctly intuits, the order\n\n                                              2\n\fappealed from is nonappealable. However, the reason it is nonappealable is not because\n– as as the city asserts – it is a postjudgment order that neither adds to nor subtracts\nanything from a final judgment, but because it is a prejudgment order filed before any\nfinal judgment has been entered. As we explain below, there is as yet no final judgment\nin Madain I. So this first appeal, G047717 is, ironically enough, premature rather than\nlate.\n              The second appeal arises out of a second action filed by Madain, trial court\ndocket number 30-2012-00582698, this one in July 2012, more than two years after our\nJune 2010 decision in Madain I. This appeal – our docket number G048323 – arises out\nof a sustained demurrer to Madain’s first amended complaint in that action. As to this\nappeal, we conclude: To the degree Madain seeks any damages pursuant to state law\nunder section 1095 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1 the demurrer was properly sustained,\nbecause section 1095 is trumped by two sections of the Government Code (§ 818.4 and\n§ 821.2) which specifically preclude a litigant from obtaining damages in connection\nwith the issuance of a permit. But to the degree Madain seeks damages pursuant to\nsection 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code2 for any delays after Madain I, he has\nstated sufficient facts to show that the city manager and the city development manager,\nacting on their own, may have been purposefully delaying Madain’s application in order\nto discourage the opening of his business altogether. That part of the lawsuit is\nprocedurally sound. But he has alleged no facts showing a city policy to delay his\nbusiness and therefore the judgment of dismissal as to the city itself is otherwise\naffirmed.\n                                                 FACTS\n              A good starting point precedes our opinion in Madain I. In 2008, the city\nof Stanton had a “sensitive use ordinance” which precluded adult cabarets from operating\n\n        1     All further references to “section 1095” are to the California Code of Civil Procedure.\n        2     All further references to “section 1983” are to Title 42 of the United States Code.\n\n\n                                                      3\n\fwithin 300 feet of a “planned” church. (Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1283.) In\nlate 2008, Madain sought to open an adult cabaret in Stanton. (Id. at p. 1280.) He had\nprepared both tenant improvement plans and a formal application for a permit to operate\nan adult cabaret, and, he said, he tried to file both the application and the tenant\nimprovement plans on December 2, 2008. However – again according to Madain – he\nwas told that day by “the city employee at the front desk” that she would only take the\ntenant improvement plans at that time, and the city’s planning manager would look at\nthose plans and then contact him. (Id. at pp. 1280-1281.) Madain left without formally\nfiling his prepared application.\n              The next day, December 3 – again, in Madain’s view – a city employee\ncontacted the Branches Christian Church, and apparently told the church to hurry up and\nfile its own application to operate in another part of the same industrial park area\n(Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1290-1291 (conc. opn. of Sills, P. J.) of the city.\n(See id. at p. 1281 (maj. opn.).) The church filed its application five days after the\ncontact, December 8, 2008. It took another 10 days after the church’s December 8\napplication for the city manager to contact Madain. Specifically, on December 18, 2008,\nthe city manager returned the tenant improvements plans which the unnamed city\nemployee had allowed Madain to file on December 2, 2008, and informed him his project\nwould not proceed until he filed an application. (Id. at p. 1281.)\n              Madain filed his application on January 6, 2009. That application was\ndenied by letter about a week later, on January 14, 2009, because the proposed place of\noperation was within 300 feet of a “planned ‘religious institution.’” (Madain I, supra,\n185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1280.) Madain then appealed the denial of the permit to the city\ncouncil. On February 10, 2009, the city council heard evidence on the application. The\ncity found that because the church’s application was filed prior to Madain’s, the permit\nhad to be denied under the city’s sensitive use ordinance. (Id. at p. 1283.)\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                 On February 23, 2009, Madain filed a petition for writs of mandate and\nadministrative mandate. The petition alleged Madain’s side of the story: He was going\nto file a formal application on December 2, 2008, but the city – for no good reason –\ndeclined to accept it, allowing the church to get in its application on December 8, before\nMadain could file his. (See also Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1290.) Madain\nasserted the city had “violated” his “First and Fourteenth Amendment free speech rights\nand has been and is causing [him] irreparable damage and also damages for the delay.”\nThe text of Madain’s petition specifically mentioned section 1983, albeit only in the\ncontext of asserting a right to attorney fees. A “crawl”3 described the document as a\nwhole as a “Petition for writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1094.5 and Title 42 United States Code, section 1983.” The petition\nprayed for “damages according to proof” and attorney fees, but its prayer did not specify\nthe basis for any damages claim. Nor was there any specific request for damages based\non delay qua delay.\n                 The trial court ruled on Madain’s petition April 10, 2009. The court denied\nthe petition, holding the church had applied first, the application was sufficient to\nestablish a “‘planned’” church under the sensitive use ordinance, and Madain’s\nsubsequent application was properly denied because his adult use was contemplated\nwithin 300 feet of that church. As we later noted in Madain I, the trial court did not\nanalyze Madain’s argument that the city had “failed to make findings” on the question of\nwhether it had “‘conspired’” to prevent his application on December 2, 2008, concluding\nsuch arguments were “‘ancillary’” and “‘irrelevant’” (italics in the original) to his\npetition. (Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1285.) Madain then timely appealed\nfrom the May 2009 judgment denying his petition, and in June 2010, this court issued its\nopinion.\n\n         3         That is, a running subheading appearing on line 28 on normal 28-line pleading paper that does not\nappear to be part of the text but rather is put there to describe the document itself .\n\n\n                                                         5\n\f                 In Madain I, we concluded the determinative issue was Madain’s assertion\nhe attempted to file his permit application on December 2, 2008, noting the assertion\nraised the “spectre of city employees intentionally manipulating events to assist the\nchurch in gaining priority over Madain’s proposed adult cabaret.” (Madain I, supra, 185\nCal.App.4th at p. 1289.) We further noted the city itself asserted Madain had not\nattempted to file an application on December 2, 2008. We concluded the city’s assertion\ncreated a dispute of fact as whether Madain had, or had not, attempted to file an\napplication that day. (Ibid.)\n                 And because it was a dispute of fact, we made no determination as to\nwhether or not Madain had attempted to file his application on December 2, 2008. We\ncould not tell if the city had manipulated events to trap Madain, and concluded we needed\nspecific factual findings on the question of whether Madain had attempted to file an\napplication on December 2, but was prevented from doing so. (Madain I, supra, 185\nCal.App.4th at p. 1290.) We reversed the trial court’s order denying the writ of mandate,\nbut further required the court not to grant the petition, but to issue a writ requiring the city\nto reconsider the matter, specifically including the question of whether Madain had\nattempted to file on December 2. (Ibid.)\n                 We now pick up the story after Madain I was filed on June 23, 2010. The\ncity did not petition the Supreme Court for review, but did file a depublication request in\nmid-August. Opposition was filed to that request on August 23.4 On August 27, 2010 –\nwhile the depublication request was still pending in the California Supreme Court – the\ntrial court issued a “judgment.” This document mostly tracked the disposition of our\nopinion in Madain I. It set aside the May 2009 judgment, and ordered the city to set\naside its February 10 decision denying Madain’s permit and to “reconsider” his\napplication.\n\n          4         We take judicial notice of the public docket of the California Supreme Court showing what was\nfiled in this case at that court.\n\n\n                                                         6\n\f              We say “mostly” tracked, because the August 27, 2010 trial court judgment\ngave Madain something inherent in, but not made explicit by, the disposition of our\nopinion in Madain I – namely the possibility that, instead of the city itself making the\nnecessary findings of fact, it might be done by a neutral decision maker. The August 27,\n2010 judgment thus directed the city to have the hearing “conducted by impartial and\nneutral members of the City Council or a hearing officer to be appointed by the City.”\nMoreover, the hearing was to be limited to events of December 2, 2008, including “the\nconduct of City staff” regarding that application. The August 27 judgment also stated:\n“After the new hearing and decision by the City Council of the City of Stanton, the\nmatter may, at the request of either party, be restored to the calendar of the Superior\nCourt.” A writ was to issue in conformity with the judgment.\n              The city’s formal return to the writ directed to be issued by the August 27,\n2010 judgment disclosed that the city and Madain had agreed a retired appellate court\njustice, the Honorable Michael Nott, would make factual findings regarding the events of\nDecember 2, 2008. Both parties agreed they would be bound by Justice Nott’s findings.\nThe response further recited that Justice Nott had already heard the matter on November\n11, but had not yet issued his findings. The city promised that it would “promptly take\naction consistent” with his findings when he did issue them.\n              Justice Nott issued his decision December 30, 2010. He had heard\ntestimony from a number of witnesses, including the city planning manager Omar\nDadabhoy, Madain himself, and a planning department employee named Kelly Scott.\nJustice Nott found Madain credible, and concluded, as a matter of fact, that Madain had\nindeed offered to file an application on December 2, 2008, but Scott told him it was not\nnecessary to file an application at that time. Justice Nott further found that had the\napplication been accepted, Madain’s application would have predated the application\nfiled by the Branches Christian Church. Justice Nott also found Dadabhoy took an\nunreasonable amount of time (16 days) to notify Madain an application needed to be\n\n                                              7\n\ffiled. And he further observed that Scott’s statement she had told Madain it was not\nnecessary to file an application in order to have tenant improvement plans approved was\nin direct conflict with a letter the city manager wrote to Madain dated December 18,\nwhich said the application had to be filed before any tenant improvement plans could be\nfiled. Justice Nott summed up his conclusion with the statement that “in sum, the hearing\nofficer is of the opinion that intentionally or unintentionally, Madain was unfairly treated\nby the City.”\n                 That brings us to 2011. For purposes of this case, almost the entirety of\n2011 was taken up with the process of Madain submitting tenant improvement plans to\nthe city, and the city returning them for correction of various supposed deficiencies\nwhich, at least for purposes of demurrer, can perhaps best be described with the word\n“minutiae.” The record contains no less than six separate “screen checks,” which on their\nface appear to be itemizations of various physical details, or even merely the descriptions\nof physical details, requiring correction. All these screen checks were in the form of\ncorrespondence on city stationary signed either by Carol Jacobs, “City Manager” or\nOmar Dadabhoy, “Community Development Director.”5\n                 Regulations promulgated by the city pursuant to its adult-oriented business\nlicense ordinance in the Stanton Municipal Code provide that it is the city manager who\n“shall investigate” any adult-oriented use application, and further provide that the city\nmanager is to grant the license within 20 days after the application is filed unless the city\nmanager finds the business does not comply with some provision in the municipal code.\n                 Given the procedural posture of this case (as the party responding to a\ndemurrer, Madain gets the benefit of the doubt, not the city) we express no opinion on the\nmerits of these correction requests, except to note Madain stated in a declaration that a\nnumber of them were brought up at later stages in the process than necessary. According\n\n       5        These letters are part of a motion in trial court docket number 30-2009-00119013 case, which\nMadain made in January 2012 to compel the city council to immediately issue his requested permit.\n\n\n                                                       8\n\fto Madain (we need not opine on the merits of the point) the requests were nothing more\nthan nit-picking.\n              On January 11, 2012, just a few weeks after the fifth screen check had been\nsent to Madain in December 2011, and before the final, sixth, screen check would be sent\nout on January 17, Madain brought a motion in the trial court to require the city to\nimmediately issue him a permit. The hearing was scheduled for February 10, 2012, but,\non January 26, the city’s planning division gave its approval to his plans. Madain,\narguing against the city’s position that his motion was by then moot, asserted that he had\nrequested the city to hire an independent company to oversee the approval process, a\nrequest that had been accepted, but only after the city had “road blocked the project at\nevery turn” during the previous year.\n              The motion went off calendar on February 10. The record discloses no\nfurther activity in the Madain I case until some five months later, on July 11, 2012. At\nthat point, Madain’s business was about to open. With new counsel, he took the step of\nfiling a motion for leave to file an amended petition to assert a request for some $3\nmillion in delay damages, and add two individuals, Dadabhoy and Jacobs, to the petition.\nNew material to be added to the petition included a statement that pursuant to both\nsection 1095 and section 1983 Madain was entitled to recover damages from the city for\nits delay going back to late 2008.\n              The same day (July 11, 2012) Madain filed a new action (trial court docket\nnumber 30-2012-00582698, or “Madain II” as the parties call in the briefs) which was a\nstraight-on “complaint for damages pursuant to CCP § 1095.” This original complaint\ncentered on the “litany” of “stall tactics” allegedly engaged in by the city in 2011, but\ndoes not contain any reference to section 1983. (That would soon change.)\n              Meanwhile, in Madain I, Madain’s motion for leave to file an amended\npetition was denied in a minute order authored by the trial judge then assigned to the\ncase, Judge David Chaffee, dated October 25, 2012. The thrust of the minute order was\n\n                                              9\n\fthat because our opinion in Madain I did not mention the issue of damages, no damages\ncould be recovered thereafter.6 In response to the point that the issue of damages was\npremature in the wake of Madain I, the minute order reasoned that under section 1095\ndamages was “not an issue that can be brought up after damages has [sic] been entered.”\nThe court furthered reasoned that section 1095 requires any damages determination “take\nplace in one proceeding.”\n                 The minute order said: “As written, the Judgment is construed as resolving\nall issues. Reopening a Judgment and purporting to continue the case and permit further\nproceedings is in excess of the court’s jurisdiction. Delmuto v. Superior Court (1932)\n119 Cal.App. 590, 595. Therefore, amendment at this juncture can’t occur.” The judge\nfurther concluded the language in the judgment (apparently referring to the August 27,\n2010 judgment) saying the case could be restored to civil calendar “[p]erhaps” applied to\nmotions concerning the costs memo or attorney’s fees, but “the issues of damages were\nresolved.”7\n                 Judge Chaffee added that damages incurred since the original writ petition\n(trial court docket number 30-2009-00119013, or Madain I) could not be a part of the\nexisting judgment. Rather, those damages were the subject of an “entirely new action.”\nThe same went for the two individuals to be named in the amended petition, Dadabhoy\nand Jacobs, given that there were no “Doe” allegations in the original petition.\nMoreover, the delay as to those individuals was “unexplained and prejudicial.”\n\n\n\n        6          We quote the salient portion of the minute order:\n                   “The Court of Appeal Opinion did not include any consideration of, or reference to, damages. The\nCourt’s order denying the writ of mandate was reversed but the directions were limited to ‘issue a writ of mandamus\nrequiring the City to vacate its denial of Mandain’s [sic] permit application and reconsider the matter, including\nMandain’s [sic] contention he was ready to file his adult-oriented business application on December 2, 2008.\nAppellant to recover his costs on appeal.’ This order formed the basis of the Court’s Judgment, which did not refer\nto damages.”\n         7         He elaborated at the end of the minute order: “Judgment was entered in this case on 08/27/10.\nDamages were not included in the Judgment and were not included in the Court of Appeal’s opinion. The Judgment\ndisposes of all issues of the Petition. Therefore, there is no Petition remaining to amend.”\n\n\n                                                        10\n\f                  The battle then shifted to the new action (trial docket number 2698, aka\nMadain II), with the city’s demurrer filed in mid-November. The city argued the new\naction was barred by res judicata, at least for those damages incurred up to the judgment\nin Madain I, barred by the six-month Government Tort claims statute of limitations (with\nthe accrual beginning December 2, 2008), and in any event precluded by the statutory\nimmunity for permit delay under Government Code section 821.2.\n                  Meanwhile, back on the Madain I front, Madain filed a notice of appeal\nfrom the October 25, 2012 minute order, denying the motion to amend the original\npetition in Madain I. This is the G047717 docket number appeal referenced in our\ncaption.\n                  Before the demurrer in Madain II could be heard, Madain filed a first\namended complaint. Unlike the original, this one did include an explicit request for\ndamages under the federal statute, section 1983. This amended pleading included as\nindividual defendants city planning manager Dadabhoy, city manager Jacobs, and Kelly\nScott.\n                  The first amended complaint pled alternative theories regarding the actions\nof the individual defendants. On the one hand, the first amended complaint asserted that\nthe city was the “‘moving force’” behind the deprivation of Madain’s equal protection,\ndue process and free speech rights as detailed in the obstacles he had faced from the city.\nOn the other hand, it asserted that Dadabhoy, Jacobs and Scott were “rogue municipal\nemployees” who had used their positions at city hall to violate Madain’s civil rights.8\n\n\n\n\n          8        The first amended complaint does not use the phrase “official policy” to describe the city’s various\nattempts to stop or otherwise delay Madain’s business, instead saying the city was the “moving force” behind those\nattempts. The “moving force” image is derived from Kentucky v. Graham (1985) 473 U.S. 159, 166. That passage\nreads in pertinent part: “On the merits, to establish personal liability in a § 1983 action, it is enough to show that the\nofficial, acting under color of state law, caused the deprivation of a federal right. . . . More is required in an\nofficial-capacity action, however, for a governmental entity is liable under § 1983 only when the entity itself is a\n‘“moving force’” behind the deprivation . . . .”\n\n\n                                                           11\n\fBeyond the general allegation of rogueness, however, the complaint does not explain how\nDadabhoy, Jacobs and Scott delayed Madain’s permit.\n                  The city demurred again, arguing Madain’s delay claims were barred by res\njudicata by virtue of a final judgment in Madain I. The city also asserted that various\nstatutes of limitations, statutory immunity, and lack of any allegation the delay was a\nresult of “official policy” or “action or ratification by an official with final policy-making\nauthority” or “custom or practice allowing or condoning the action” all precluded any\nliability on any defendant’s part. The demurrer also noted that Madain had pled mutually\nexclusive theories of liability as to the city on the one hand and the three individual\ndefendants on the other.\n                  The demurrer was sustained in late February 2013 in a minute order made\nby the new judge assigned to the case, Geoffrey Glass. However, the denial was with\nleave to amend. The minute order said it was unclear who Madain was suing on various\nsection 1983 causes of action, though it “appear[ed]” Madain was suing Stanton on a\nrespondeat superior theory.” But, said the trial judge, respondeat superior clearly does\nnot apply to section 1983 causes of action. Likewise, he concluded that Madain had\nfailed to “identify the ‘official policy’ that caused the individual defendants to violate the\nconstitution.” The judge further noted the fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action “are\ncompletely contradictory to the allegations in the rest of the complaint.”9\n                  Rather than amend, Madain stipulated to dismissal of Madain II in early\nApril 2013, then filed a notice of appeal from the order of dismissal almost immediately\nafter. A month later, on May 3, 2013, a formal judgment of dismissal was entered,\ncuring the technical prematurity of Madain’s mid-April notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n\n         9        As drafted, Madain has listed three section 1983 causes of action, corresponding to free speech,\nequal protection and due process.\n\n\n                                                         12\n\f                                         DISCUSSION\nA. The First Appeal: Madain I (G047717). Dismissed\n               Each party sees the appeal from the order of October 12, 2012 differently.\nFor Madain, the first appeal is from a postjudgment order which raises issues different\nfrom those addressed in the underlying judgment. For the city, the first appeal is from a\npostjudgment order that merely raises the same issues already disposed of in an\nunderlying final judgment.\n               We don’t agree with either analysis. Both rely on an erroneous premise.\nThe “judgment” of August 27, 2010, was not a final, appealable judgment. That\ndocument clearly left issues for further consideration beyond mere compliance. “‘As a\ngeneral test, which must be adapted to the particular circumstances of the individual case,\nit may be said that where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of\ncompliance or noncompliance with the terms of the first decree, that decree is final, but\nwhere anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential\nto a final determination of the rights of the parties, the decree is interlocutory.’” (Griset\nv. Fair Political Practices Com. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 688, 698; see also Eisenberg et al.,\nCal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 2013) ¶ 2:37, p. 2-24\n[“The general test of finality focuses on whether and to what extent issues remain to be\ndecided in the lower court case . . . .”].)\n               We may identify at least two issues the judgment of August 27, 2010, left\nfor future consideration. One was the request for a permit itself. Madain’s original\npetition prayed for an injunction that the city be “ordered to grant” him “the adult\noriented business license that [he was] seeking.” The judgment of this court in Madain I,\ndid not give him that relief, but nor did it deny it to him. All it did was give him a\nhearing on the factual question which might – or, just as easily, might not – have\novercome a threshold obstacle as one step in a process which might result in his\nobtaining the “license [he was] seeking.” The trial court’s judgment of August 27, 2010\n\n                                              13\n\f– no proceedings in the trial court had occurred in the interim since our June 2010\nopinion – merely tracked the limited relief Madain had obtained in this court, ordering\nthe city “to set aside its decision of February 10, 2009 and to reconsider [Madain’s]\npetition for the adult oriented business license.” Manifestly, achieving reconsideration of\na step in the process of making a request is not the same as being entitled to what is\nrequested. Accordingly, the August 27, 2010 judgment expressly stated that after the\n“new hearing and decision” by the city, “the matter may, at the request of either party, be\nrestored to the calendar of the Superior Court.”\n              But there was at least one other issue – not even counting Madain’s specific\nrequest for attorney fees under federal law made in the original petition: damages. Both\nthe text of the petition and its prayer sought damages. And, similar to Madain’s request\nfor a permit itself, the issue of damages was contingent on Madain’s first obtaining his\npermit.\n              In other words, under the no-issue-left-for-future consideration” standard of\nGriset, on August 27, 2010, there were miles to go in this case before there could be a\nfinal resolution of the issue of whether Madain would receive – or not receive – the\nlicense he was seeking, or any damages incurred in the process.\n              The fact the August 27, 2010 “judgment” was labeled a “judgment” is not\ndeterminative. Regardless of the label, it is the substance of the document which\ndetermines whether it is a final judgment for purposes of appeal. (Jackson v. Wells\nFargo Bank (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 240, 244 [“The record in the court below does indeed\ncontain a document entitled ‘Final Judgment,’ but it is patently no such thing by the very\nterms of the stipulation pursuant to which it was filed. It is clear that no effect can or\nshould be given to such a label if the judgment does not in fact conclude matters between\nthe parties.”]; see also Pazderka v. Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th\n658, 666 [“‘substance and effect of the court’s order or judgment and not the label which\ndetermines whether the party can appeal.”].) In substance, the “judgment” of August 27,\n\n                                              14\n\f2010, was nothing more than an interlocutory order in the process of a yet-to-be-made\ndetermination of whether Madain would obtain a final judgment giving him his permit\nand adjudicating his entitlement to any damages incurred in the process of his quest for\npermit.\n                  The trial judge relied on three opinions to deny Madain’s amendment\nrequest on the theory the August 27, 2010 “judgment” was by then final. All three hail\nfrom a time when it did not require the better part of an afternoon to digest an appellate\nopinion. None is longer than a couple of pages. None affects our analysis.\n                  Gould v. Moss (1910) 158 Cal. 548 stands – at most – for the idea that a\nclaim for costs does not fall within the category of an issue left for further consideration\nin an otherwise final judgment. (See Kaufman v. Pacific Indem. Co. (1936) 5 Cal.2d 761,\n769 [“Under the authority of Gould v. Moss . . . where a judgment which does not carry\ncosts has become final, whether correct or not, a defendant cannot be held for costs.”].)\nThe original petition in Madain I still has issues to be adjudicated – not costs – and is\nthus not analogous to the final judgment in Gould.\n                  Beatty v. Clark Colony Water Co. (1915) 28 Cal.App. 752 (really, Beatty\nIII10) stands for the proposition that if a plaintiff has to obtain a writ of mandate to force\nthe defendant to do an act and is thereby entitled to damages, it is an error for an\n\n           10       The Beatty case actually consists three opinions, all short and all issued in close succession in the\nfirst series of the California Appellate Reports: Beatty v. Clark Colony Water Co. (1915) 28 Cal.App. 745 (Beatty\nI); Beatty v. Clark Colony Water Co. (1915) 28 Cal.App. 749 (Beatty II) and Beatty v. Clark Colony Water Co.,\nsupra, 28 Cal.App. 752 (Beatty III). Basically, a couple who owned land in Monterey County sued their water\ncompany for water, and obtained a judgment requiring the company to deliver it to them. (Beatty I, supra, 28\nCal.App. at p. 748.) The water company appealed from “that portion of the judgment” providing for the delivery of\nwater, arguing it wasn’t obligated to supply the water. (Id. at pp. 747-749.) The water company lost, the relevant\nportion of the judgment was affirmed. That was Beatty I.\n                    The water company also filed a separate appeal from an order denying a motion for new trial (and\nalso from the judgment), apparently arguing that the judgment included a lot which was not otherwise owned by the\nplaintiffs. The water company succeeded in obtaining a modification of the judgment to the degree it erroneously\nincluded that lot. (Beatty II, supra, 28 Cal.App. at p. 750.) That was Beatty II.\n                    Finally, the plaintiffs filed their own, separate appeal from that “portion” of the same judgment\nwhich declined to award them damages. (Beatty III, supra, 28 Cal.App. at pp. 752-753.) The court held that the\n“undisputed evidence” entitled them to damages for past delay on the water company’s part, and therefore “that\nportion” of the judgment should be reversed to let them try their damages issue “anew.” (Id. at p. 753.) That was\nBeatty III, which is the case the trial judge here mentioned in his minute order.\n\n\n                                                           15\n\fotherwise final judgment not to include a provision for damages, and that omission is\ngrounds for reversal in a timely appeal by the plaintiff from that judgment. (See id. at p.\n753.) Beatty III does not affect this case because it arose out of a judgment which\nprovided for the plaintiffs to obtain a writ of mandate giving them the substantive relief\nthey sought – an order that a water company deliver water to them – but which\nerroneously omitted to address their request for damages as a result of the water\ncompany’s past failure to deliver water to them. That omission was redressed in a\nsuccessful appeal by the plaintiffs from the “portion” of the judgment from which they\nappealed. (Ibid.) The August 27, 2010 judgment in the case before us, by contrast, did\nnot give Madain the substantive relief he sought. It only gave him the further opportunity\nto pursue that relief. Therefore it cannot be assumed that the damages issue was\nnecessarily included in the August 27, 2010 judgment. It wasn’t. By August 2010, it\nhadn’t been established that Madain was entitled to any substantive relief sought in\noriginal petition, because it remained possible the city might prevail on its factual\nassertion that Madain didn’t try to file his application on December 2, 2008.\n                  Finally, Delmuto v. Superior Court (1932) 119 Cal.App. 590, merely\ndetermines a long final judgment in an automobile accident case cannot be reopened to\nmake a defendant held expressly not liable in the original judgment liable in a modified\njudgment. Delmuto is inapt here because there the long final judgment clearly left no\nissues for future consideration, it just got one of those issues (the liability of a negligent\nminor participating in a race) wrong.11 Delmuto cannot be read, as the trial judge read it\nhere, for the idea that our decision in Madain I necessarily “resolv[ed] all issues.” As we\n\n         11        Delmuto involved three young automobile drivers who were racing each other. One was injured\nand sued the other two. The case went to trial, with the judge finding that the racer who was a minor was negligent;\nthe other racer, not a minor, was not. The judgment, however, only provided that the plaintiff take damages from\nthe defendant minor’s mother, and, inexplicably, expressly provided that the plaintiff take nothing as against the\nminor himself. Three years after the judgment became final – in the depths of the Great Depression – the plaintiff\nsought to amend the court’s conclusions of law to reopen the case against the minor. And the trial court granted his\nrequest. The Court of Appeal had little difficulty concluding the order was in excess of the trial court’s jurisdiction.\n(Delmuto, supra, 119 Cal.App. at pp. 594-595.)\n\n\n                                                          16\n\fsaid, it didn’t. Madain I did not even reach the main issue of substantive relief sought in\nMadain’s original pleading.\n              So what are we to make of the order of October 25, 2012, denying the\nrequest to amend the original petition? This is where it gets complicated.\n              An order denying a request to amend a pleading prior to a final judgment is\nitself not appealable unless the order has the effect of eliminating all issues, so there is\nnothing left to be tried or determined. (Figueroa v. Northridge Hospital Medical Center\n(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 10, 12; Haro v. City of Rosemead (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1067,\n1078; Ingram v. Superior Court (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 483, 489 [“Although an order\ndenying leave to amend a complaint is not an appealable order . . . when such orders have\nthe effect of eliminating issues between a plaintiff and defendant so that nothing is left to\nbe determined, the order is a final judgment and is appealable.”].)\n              Here, the order of October 25, 2012 certainly did not eliminate any issues\nbetween Madain and the City of Stanton. Even assuming, for sake of argument, that the\nquestion of Madain’s underlying right to a permit had already been eliminated because it\nwas moot (since he already received his permit back in January of the same year), the\nissue of damages still remained. We hadn’t resolved that issue in Madain I – to repeat,\nbecause we couldn’t. And beyond damages, the issue of attorney fees remained as well.\n              In substance then, the August 27, 2010 “judgment” and the October 25,\n2012 denial order were both interlocutory and not appealable. (See Lyon v. Goss (1942)\n19 Cal.2d 659, 670 [where something “further in the nature of judicial action on the part\nof the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties, the decree is\ninterlocutory”].)\n              Madain has not, in his briefing, requested we treat the appeal from the\nOctober 25, 2012 order as a de facto writ petition, but counsel mentioned our ability to\ntreat it as such at oral argument. Unfortunately, case law is clear that this power should\nbe reserved for “unusual” cases. (H.D. Arnaiz, Ltd. v. County of San Joaquin (2002) 96\n\n                                               17\n\fCal.App.4th 1357, 1366-1367.) While every case is unique, not every case is unusual –\nat least not in the way envisioned in Arnaiz. Since Madain did not make a formal request\nin his briefing that would have explained how his case called for the unusual remedy he\nalluded to at argument and allowed the city to respond to it, we decline to treat his appeal\nas a de facto writ petition. The good news for the city is that the appeal in G047717 must\ntherefore be dismissed. The bad news for the city is that Madain I remains a case where\nthe issue of damages and attorney fees have not yet been adjudicated, and in which there\nis yet no final judgment. Further proceedings will be required before the case can be laid\nto rest.\nB. The Second Appeal: Madain II (G048323). Split Decision.\n              Madain II is a different matter. Procedurally it is much cleaner. Given the\njudgment of dismissal filed May 3, 2013, there is no doubt about appealability. We have\na straightforward case of a sustained demurrer where the plaintiff elected not to amend,\neliminating all issues between the parties, and thus presenting a cleanly appealable\njudgment.\n              Preliminarily, it is important to recognize that Madain has alleged\nalternative, and indeed inconsistent, theories as to the origins of the delays he has\nencountered. And, indeed, that is his right under California law. As the court said in\nMendoza v. Continental Sales Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1402: “When a pleader\nis in doubt about what actually occurred or what can be established by the evidence, the\nmodern practice allows that party to plead in the alternative and make inconsistent\nallegations.” (Accord, Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 593 [“a party may plead in\nthe alternative and may make inconsistent allegations”].) Thus he has alleged that either\nthe delays were the result of rogue city employees acting on their own, or as the result of\na deliberate city effort which was the “moving force” behind those delays.\n              The city raises a number of valid points which have the effect of\nwinnowing down Madain’s delay claim to a bare minimum. First, we note the city’s\n\n                                             18\n\fstatutory immunity argument is a correct one as to state law. All state law delay claims\nare based on section 1095, which provides for damages for a successful litigant seeking a\nwrit of administrate mandate. But section 1095 is, when it comes to delay damages\nincurred in obtaining land use permits, in direct conflict with Government Code sections\n818.4 and 821.2. Those two statutes effectively insulate public entities and public\nemployees from liability for failure to issue permits. Case law squarely holds the two\nGovernment Code sections trump the more general Civil Procedure Code section. (See\nLopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 804 [observing\n“imposing liability on the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 1095 would be\ntantamount to a repeal of sections 818.4 and 821.2]; O’Hagan v. Board of Zoning\nAdjustment (1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 722, 728 [“In essence, Code of Civil Procedure,\nsection 1095, provides that if the petitioner for mandamus recovers judgment, he may\nalso recover damages which he has sustained and that such damages shall be recovered\nand awarded against the public entity represented by such officer but not against the\nofficer. This is, of course, in direct conflict with the applicable provisions of the Tort\nClaims Act which provide a clear-cut immunity for discretionary acts in general . . . and\nfor licensing activities in particular . . . . For the reasons which follow we resolve the\nconflict in favor of the Tort Claims Act, and hold that the immunity provisions of the act\nmust be given effect over the damage provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, section\n1095.”].)\n              The state immunity provisions, of course, cannot affect federal civil rights\nclaims under section 1983. (See Williams v. Horvath (1976) 16 Cal.3d 834, 841-842\n[federal civil rights claims may not be frustrated by state substantive limitations “couched\nin procedural language”].) So, we must now turn to the city’s statute of limitations\nargument as it applies to section 1983 claims.\n              As a matter of federal law, section 1983 carries the same statute of\nlimitations as the state personal injury statute of limitations in the state where the alleged\n\n                                              19\n\fcivil rights violation occurred. “The United States Supreme Court has held that an action\nbrought pursuant to . . . section 1983 is a personal injury action, and that the appropriate\nstatute of limitations is the statute of limitations for personal injury causes of action in\nthe particular state in which the case is filed.” (See Jackson v. Cedars-Sinai Medical\nCenter (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1315, 1323.) The current state personal injury statute of\nlimitations is within two years of the injury-causing wrongful act. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 335.1.)\n              As to the statute of limitations, any “delay” injuries caused either by the\ncity, or arguendo by any employees going “rogue,” must be divided, as Judge Chaffee\nnoted in his minute order, into two separate categories: (1) the delay attendant on the\ninitial denial of Madain’s permit application on February 10, 2009, as set out in the facts\nin Madain I, and (2) the delay attendant on any unreasonableness in the city’s processing\nof Madain’s tenant improvement and application in the year 2011, in the aftermath of our\ndecision in Madain I.\n              As to the first period, the statute of limitations has already run. Madain II\nwas filed in July 2012. The delay attendant on the denial of Madain’s application\noccurred in February 2009 – more than three years previously. The city, we would also\nobserve, had every right to use legal process to defend its decision in the courts\nafterward, so that period of delay certainly cannot be charged to it. (See generally\nManta Management Corp. v. City of San Bernardino (2008) 43 Cal.4th 400, 408 [city’s\nseeking preliminary injunction against operation of an adult cabaret and later an appellate\nstay after the dissolution of the preliminary injunction were not acts for which city could\nbe held responsible].) And Madain has proffered no argument on appeal that the time\nconsumed in the appellate proceeding that resulted in Madain I tolls the two-year statute\nof limitations as a matter of federal law under section 1983. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat all section 1983 claims set forth in Madain II that derive from the city’s February\n2009 denial of his permit are precluded by the statute of limitations.\n\n                                              20\n\f                  That leaves only the second period of delay – caused by the alleged\nnitpicking of tenant improvement plans in the year 2011 – as a statute of limitations issue.\nWe may observe at this point that a city’s unreasonable bureaucratic delay in processing\na benefit to which a litigant is otherwise entitled can indeed be the basis of a valid section\n1983 claim for violation of due process rights. (See Kraebel v. New York City\nDepartment of Housing Preservation and Development (2d Cir. 1992) 959 F.2d 395,\n405.12).) We cannot see why the same rule would not also apply to a business permit as\nto which an applicant may claim first amendment protection. And, since Madain II was\nfiled well within two years of 2011, claims based on the second period of delay survive a\nstatute of limitations challenge.\n                  We now consider the city’s main argument, and the one that primarily\nanimated the trial court’s sustaining of the city’s demurrer, namely that Madain has not\nalleged that the delay in 2011 was part of some city “policy” to discourage adult\nbusinesses by the device of unreasonable processing of tenant improvement minutiae –\nthe “death of a thousand screen checks approach” to killing an undesired land use.\n                  The “policy” argument derives from Monell v. Department of Social\nServices (1978) 436 U.S. 658. The late Justice Crosby cogently observed in Choate v.\nCounty of Orange (2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 312, 328-329 that “Monell doctrine ‘has\nproduced a body of law that is neither readily understood nor easy to apply’ . . . . If there\n\n\n          12       Kraebel presents a fairly close parallel with this case on the point of whether bureaucratic nit-\npicking and repetitive review can trigger a viable section 1983 claim. The case involved a landlord who undertook\nextensive voluntary and, for her, costly improvements to her apartment building in reliance on a city program that\npromised her property tax breaks in return. (Kraebel, supra, 959 F.2d at p. 398.) But to gain the tax breaks, the\nlandlord had to submit applications for tax exemptions and abatements. Those applications were “subjected to\nrepetitive reviews by numerous people, several of whom demanded further documentation that was not even\nrequired” by the regulations promulgated in connection with the city program. (Id. at p. 398.) It took the city a year\nand half to process her applications. (Ibid.) The appellate court reversed the district court’s federal rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissal of her due process claim, stating “due process requires that eligibility for a variety of benefits be processed\nwithin a reasonable time” (id. at p. 405) because “‘implicit in the conferral of an entitlement is a further entitlement\nto receive the entitlement within a reasonable time.’” (Ibid., quoting Schroeder v. City of Chicago (7th Cir. 1991)\n927 F.2d 957, 960.) The court further held that while delay is natural with an administrative bureaucracy, there was\n“at least a question of fact as to whether these delays were egregious and without rational justification.” (Kraebel,\nsupra, 959 F.2d at p. 405.)\n\n\n                                                           21\n\fis any pattern to Monell decisional law, it is a crazy quilt.” However, for our purposes,\nwe can distill Monell into one sentence: Local governments are not liable under section\n1983 pursuant to the classic doctrine of respondeat superior; local governments can only\nbe held liable if the civil rights violation is the result of city policy, custom, or practice.\n               That much seems clear. But again, we are forced to make separate\nanalyses, this time because of the mutually exclusive alternative allegations made in the\ncomplaint. The complaint alleges, as one alternative scenario, that three city employees,\nDadabhoy, Jacobs and Scott, acting on their own, caused the delays in obtaining the\npermit, including those occurring during the city’s allegedly unreasonable bureaucratic\nprocessing of tenant improvement plans in 2011. The Monell policy argument has no\nforce as to these three, since they are alleged to have violated Madain’s rights on their\nown. And individual city employees can indeed be held liable under section 1983 for\ntheir own conduct under color of state law. (E.g., Starr v. Baca (9th Cir. 2011) 652 F.3d\n1202, 1207-1208 [county sheriff could be individually liable for deliberate indifference to\nbrutality to prisoners in county jail by subordinates].) The city’s argument that any\nattempt to hold the three individuals liable is res judicata fails because Madain I is not res\njudicata, since there is no final judgment in it yet.\n               However, as to at least one of the three individual defendants, Kelly Scott,\nthere is a problem of insufficient facts alleged to show she did anything in 2011 which\nhad anything to do with the case. Mere conclusions are not sufficient to state a section\n1983 claim. (See Kennedy v. H & M Landing, Inc. (9th Cir. 1976) 529 F.2d 987, 989 [“A\npleading will not be sufficient to state a claim under the Civil Rights Act if the allegations\nare mere conclusions.”].) Neither the first amended complaint, nor the 2011 screen check\nletters (trial court docket number 30-2009-00119013), of which we may take judicial\nnotice (for purposes of the case of trial court docket number 30-2012-00582698),\nmention her in any way, and we cannot find evidence or theory to support a section 1983\nclaim against her.\n\n                                               22\n\f                  We cannot, however, say the same about Jacobs and Dadabhoy, whose\nfingerprints are all over the allegedly unnecessarily repetitive screen check letters. Is\nenough alleged to say they were going “rogue”? It is true that the Stanton Municipal\nCode delegated to the city manager the power to deny an adult-oriented business\napplication upon a determination the application in some way does not comply with some\npart of the city’s municipal code. But that delegation does not allow us to say, at the\ndemurrer stage, that necessarily Jacobs or Dadabhoy were acting pursuant to city policy\nin sending out those repetitive screen checks and not pursuant to some personal agenda.\n                  After all, the city manager is not the highest decision-making authority on\nthe denial. It is the Stanton city council that has the highest decision-making authority on\nthe issuance of adult-oriented business permits. From that fact it follows – apologies for\nthe double negative – that we cannot say the delays of 2011 were necessarily not the\nproduct of some personal agendas on the part of Jacobs or Dadabhoy or both. (See\nHarman v. City and County of San Francisco (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1298;13\nGernetzke v. Kenosha Unified School Dist. No. 1 (7th Cir. 2001) 274 F.3d 464, 468-469\n[issue turns on whether “the decisionmaker” was “at the apex of authority for the action\nin question.”].) So the demurrer, as it applied to any section 1983 claims, should not\nhave been sustained as to them.\n                  But that coin, which exposes Dadabhoy and Jacobs to liability, has a flip\nside that benefits the city itself: There just isn’t enough by way of factual allegations to\nshow they were acting according to city policy.\n                  To be sure, section 1983 claims can be predicated on unwritten policies.\n(See Johnson v. California (2005) 543 U.S. 499 [strict scrutiny governed prisoner’s\nsection 1983 challenge to unwritten policy of California prisons to racially segregate\n\n\n         13       As the Harmon case explains, while municipalities may be on the hook under section 1983 for\ndelegating policy-making authority to a particular official, that authority must both relate to policy and be final.\n(Harmon, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at p. 1298.)\n\n\n                                                          23\n\fprisoners when they enter a new facility]; Wanger v. Bonner (5th Cir. 1980) 621 F.2d\n675 [sheriff liable under section 1983 for unwritten policies regarding night searches of\nhomes].) But, if they are, the unwritten policy must be a permanent and well-settled one.\n(See City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik (1988) 485 U.S. 112, 127 [“Relying on the language\nof § 1983, the court has long recognized that a plaintiff may be able to prove the\nexistence of a widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express\nmunicipal policy, is ‘so permanent and well settled as to constitute a “custom or usage”\nwith the force of law.’”].)\n              Here, nothing in the record – and certainly nothing factually alleged in the\nfirst amended complaint – can be said to constitute an unwritten policy on the part of the\ncity to deter adult businesses by nit-picking tenant improvement plans. No\ncommunications to that effect are alleged to have gone from the city council to the city\nplanning department.\n              It must be remembered, in this regard, that neither the first amended\ncomplaint nor anything in the record indicates that any unreasonable screen checks or\nreturns of applications in 2011 were anything other than Jacobs’ and Dadabhoy’s own\npersonal interpretations of the city’s adult business ordinance that Madain might have\nimmediately corrected by appealing to the city’s ultimate decision maker, the city council.\nMadain gives us no reason to doubt that at any time during 2011 after the first screen\ncheck he might have immediately asked the city council for relief if he perceived that the\ncity manager was engaged in the stalling tactic of micro-scrutinizing his tenant\nimprovement plans. There are no allegations, for example, that the city council\nauthorized, encouraged, or even condoned the alleged death-by-screen-check tactics of\nthe city planning department in 2011.\n              Finally, it is not enough for Madain to allege that the city was the “moving\nforce” behind any delays he encountered by bureaucratic pettifoggery. “Moving force” is\na different element in Monell analysis than the existence of a policy, custom or practice.\n\n                                            24\n\fA section 1983 claimant must allege both the existence of a policy and that the policy\nwas the moving force behind the employee’s violation of the claimant’s civil rights. (See\nDougherty v. City of Covina (9th Cir. 2011) 654 F.3d 892, 900 [“A government entity\nmay not be held liable under . . . § 1983, unless a policy, practice, or custom of the entity\ncan be shown to be a moving force behind a violation of constitutional rights. . . . In\norder to establish liability for governmental entities under Monell, a plaintiff must prove\n‘(1) that [the plaintiff] possessed a constitutional right of which [s]he was deprived; (2)\nthat the municipality had a policy; (3) that this policy amounts to deliberate indifference\nto the plaintiff’s constitutional right; and, (4) that the policy is the moving force behind\nthe constitutional violation.’”].) Here, we may have moving force, but where’s the\npolicy?\n\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n              The appeal in G047717 is dismissed as premature. There is as yet no final\njudgment in that case. The judgment appealed from G048293 is affirmed entirely except\ninsofar as it dismisses any section 1983 claims against Jacobs and Dadabhoy.

After our decision, the matter was committed by the city itself to a retired\nappellate court justice from another district to make findings of fact on the issue of which\nof the two applicants really applied first. The retired justice determined that plaintiff\nMusa Madain had effectively joined the queue before the competing applicant, the\nBranches Christian Church. The retired justice further found the city had manipulated its\n“sensitive use” ordinance to give priority to the church over Madain, who proposed to\nopen an adult entertainment business. After the retired justice’s decision, plaintiff\nMadain was indeed able to obtain his sought-after permit, but only after a year of\nbureaucratic delay and nit-picking. This appeal centers on Madain’s quest for damages\nresulting from the delays he encountered on the way to success in obtaining his permit.\n              We arrive at a variegated decision on the two appeals before us. The first\nappeal arises out of the very same trial court action that came to us in Madain I, trial\ncourt docket number 30-2009-00119013, our docket number G047717. Technically, this\nfirst appeal is from an order denying Madain’s motion to amend his original petition filed\nin Madain I. It must be dismissed because, as the city correctly intuits, the order\n\n                                              2\n\fappealed from is nonappealable. However, the reason it is nonappealable is not because\n– as as the city asserts – it is a postjudgment order that neither adds to nor subtracts\nanything from a final judgment, but because it is a prejudgment order filed before any\nfinal judgment has been entered. As we explain below, there is as yet no final judgment\nin Madain I. So this first appeal, G047717 is, ironically enough, premature rather than\nlate.\n              The second appeal arises out of a second action filed by Madain, trial court\ndocket number 30-2012-00582698, this one in July 2012, more than two years after our\nJune 2010 decision in Madain I. This appeal – our docket number G048323 – arises out\nof a sustained demurrer to Madain’s first amended complaint in that action. As to this\nappeal, we conclude: To the degree Madain seeks any damages pursuant to state law\nunder section 1095 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1 the demurrer was properly sustained,\nbecause section 1095 is trumped by two sections of the Government Code (§ 818.4 and\n§ 821.2) which specifically preclude a litigant from obtaining damages in connection\nwith the issuance of a permit. But to the degree Madain seeks damages pursuant to\nsection 1983 of title 42 of the United States Code2 for any delays after Madain I, he has\nstated sufficient facts to show that the city manager and the city development manager,\nacting on their own, may have been purposefully delaying Madain’s application in order\nto discourage the opening of his business altogether. That part of the lawsuit is\nprocedurally sound. But he has alleged no facts showing a city policy to delay his\nbusiness and therefore the judgment of dismissal as to the city itself is otherwise\naffirmed.\n                                                 FACTS\n              A good starting point precedes our opinion in Madain I. In 2008, the city\nof Stanton had a “sensitive use ordinance” which precluded adult cabarets from operating\n\n        1     All further references to “section 1095” are to the California Code of Civil Procedure.\n        2     All further references to “section 1983” are to Title 42 of the United States Code.\n\n\n                                                      3\n\fwithin 300 feet of a “planned” church. (Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1283.) In\nlate 2008, Madain sought to open an adult cabaret in Stanton. (Id. at p. 1280.) He had\nprepared both tenant improvement plans and a formal application for a permit to operate\nan adult cabaret, and, he said, he tried to file both the application and the tenant\nimprovement plans on December 2, 2008. However – again according to Madain – he\nwas told that day by “the city employee at the front desk” that she would only take the\ntenant improvement plans at that time, and the city’s planning manager would look at\nthose plans and then contact him. (Id. at pp. 1280-1281.) Madain left without formally\nfiling his prepared application.\n              The next day, December 3 – again, in Madain’s view – a city employee\ncontacted the Branches Christian Church, and apparently told the church to hurry up and\nfile its own application to operate in another part of the same industrial park area\n(Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1290-1291 (conc. opn. of Sills, P. J.) of the city.\n(See id. at p. 1281 (maj. opn.).) The church filed its application five days after the\ncontact, December 8, 2008. It took another 10 days after the church’s December 8\napplication for the city manager to contact Madain. Specifically, on December 18, 2008,\nthe city manager returned the tenant improvements plans which the unnamed city\nemployee had allowed Madain to file on December 2, 2008, and informed him his project\nwould not proceed until he filed an application. (Id. at p. 1281.)\n              Madain filed his application on January 6, 2009. That application was\ndenied by letter about a week later, on January 14, 2009, because the proposed place of\noperation was within 300 feet of a “planned ‘religious institution.’” (Madain I, supra,\n185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1280.) Madain then appealed the denial of the permit to the city\ncouncil. On February 10, 2009, the city council heard evidence on the application. The\ncity found that because the church’s application was filed prior to Madain’s, the permit\nhad to be denied under the city’s sensitive use ordinance. (Id. at p. 1283.)\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                 On February 23, 2009, Madain filed a petition for writs of mandate and\nadministrative mandate. The petition alleged Madain’s side of the story: He was going\nto file a formal application on December 2, 2008, but the city – for no good reason –\ndeclined to accept it, allowing the church to get in its application on December 8, before\nMadain could file his. (See also Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1290.) Madain\nasserted the city had “violated” his “First and Fourteenth Amendment free speech rights\nand has been and is causing [him] irreparable damage and also damages for the delay.”\nThe text of Madain’s petition specifically mentioned section 1983, albeit only in the\ncontext of asserting a right to attorney fees. A “crawl”3 described the document as a\nwhole as a “Petition for writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1094.5 and Title 42 United States Code, section 1983.” The petition\nprayed for “damages according to proof” and attorney fees, but its prayer did not specify\nthe basis for any damages claim. Nor was there any specific request for damages based\non delay qua delay.\n                 The trial court ruled on Madain’s petition April 10, 2009. The court denied\nthe petition, holding the church had applied first, the application was sufficient to\nestablish a “‘planned’” church under the sensitive use ordinance, and Madain’s\nsubsequent application was properly denied because his adult use was contemplated\nwithin 300 feet of that church. As we later noted in Madain I, the trial court did not\nanalyze Madain’s argument that the city had “failed to make findings” on the question of\nwhether it had “‘conspired’” to prevent his application on December 2, 2008, concluding\nsuch arguments were “‘ancillary’” and “‘irrelevant’” (italics in the original) to his\npetition. (Madain I, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 1285.) Madain then timely appealed\nfrom the May 2009 judgment denying his petition, and in June 2010, this court issued its\nopinion.\n\n         3         That is, a running subheading appearing on line 28 on normal 28-line pleading paper that does not\nappear to be part of the text but rather is put there to describe the document itself .\n\n\n                                                         5\n\f                 In Madain I, we concluded the determinative issue was Madain’s assertion\nhe attempted to file his permit application on December 2, 2008, noting the assertion\nraised the “spectre of city employees intentionally manipulating events to assist the\nchurch in gaining priority over Madain’s proposed adult cabaret.” (Madain I, supra, 185\nCal.App.4th at p. 1289.) We further noted the city itself asserted Madain had not\nattempted to file an application on December 2, 2008. We concluded the city’s assertion\ncreated a dispute of fact as whether Madain had, or had not, attempted to file an\napplication that day. (Ibid.)\n                 And because it was a dispute of fact, we made no determination as to\nwhether or not Madain had attempted to file his application on December 2, 2008. We\ncould not tell if the city had manipulated events to trap Madain, and concluded we needed\nspecific factual findings on the question of whether Madain had attempted to file an\napplication on December 2, but was prevented from doing so. (Madain I, supra, 185\nCal.App.4th at p. 1290.) We reversed the trial court’s order denying the writ of mandate,\nbut further required the court not to grant the petition, but to issue a writ requiring the city\nto reconsider the matter, specifically including the question of whether Madain had\nattempted to file on December 2. (Ibid.)\n                 We now pick up the story after Madain I was filed on June 23, 2010. The\ncity did not petition the Supreme Court for review, but did file a depublication request in\nmid-August. Opposition was filed to that request on August 23.4 On August 27, 2010 –\nwhile the depublication request was still pending in the California Supreme Court – the\ntrial court issued a “judgment.” This document mostly tracked the disposition of our\nopinion in Madain I. It set aside the May 2009 judgment, and ordered the city to set\naside its February 10 decision denying Madain’s permit and to “reconsider” his\napplication.\n\n          4         We take judicial notice of the public docket of the California Supreme Court showing what was\nfiled in this case at that court.\n\n\n                                                         6\n\f              We say “mostly” tracked, because the August 27, 2010 trial court judgment\ngave Madain something inherent in, but not made explicit by, the disposition of our\nopinion in Madain I – namely the possibility that, instead of the city itself making the\nnecessary findings of fact, it might be done by a neutral decision maker. The August 27,\n2010 judgment thus directed the city to have the hearing “conducted by impartial and\nneutral members of the City Council or a hearing officer to be appointed by the City.”\nMoreover, the hearing was to be limited to events of December 2, 2008, including “the\nconduct of City staff” regarding that application. The August 27 judgment also stated:\n“After the new hearing and decision by the City Council of the City of Stanton, the\nmatter may, at the request of either party, be restored to the calendar of the Superior\nCourt.” A writ was to issue in conformity with the judgment.\n              The city’s formal return to the writ directed to be issued by the August 27,\n2010 judgment disclosed that the city and Madain had agreed a retired appellate court\njustice, the Honorable Michael Nott, would make factual findings regarding the events of\nDecember 2, 2008. Both parties agreed they would be bound by Justice Nott’s findings.\nThe response further recited that Justice Nott had already heard the matter on November\n11, but had not yet issued his findings. The city promised that it would “promptly take\naction consistent” with his findings when he did issue them.\n              Justice Nott issued his decision December 30, 2010. He had heard\ntestimony from a number of witnesses, including the city planning manager Omar\nDadabhoy, Madain himself, and a planning department employee named Kelly Scott.\nJustice Nott found Madain credible, and concluded, as a matter of fact, that Madain had\nindeed offered to file an application on December 2, 2008, but Scott told him it was not\nnecessary to file an application at that time. Justice Nott further found that had the\napplication been accepted, Madain’s application would have predated the application\nfiled by the Branches Christian Church. Justice Nott also found Dadabhoy took an\nunreasonable amount of time (16 days) to notify Madain an application needed to be\n\n                                              7\n\ffiled. And he further observed that Scott’s statement she had told Madain it was not\nnecessary to file an application in order to have tenant improvement plans approved was\nin direct conflict with a letter the city manager wrote to Madain dated December 18,\nwhich said the application had to be filed before any tenant improvement plans could be\nfiled. Justice Nott summed up his conclusion with the statement that “in sum, the hearing\nofficer is of the opinion that intentionally or unintentionally, Madain was unfairly treated\nby the City.”\n                 That brings us to 2011. For purposes of this case, almost the entirety of\n2011 was taken up with the process of Madain submitting tenant improvement plans to\nthe city, and the city returning them for correction of various supposed deficiencies\nwhich, at least for purposes of demurrer, can perhaps best be described with the word\n“minutiae.” The record contains no less than six separate “screen checks,” which on their\nface appear to be itemizations of various physical details, or even merely the descriptions\nof physical details, requiring correction. All these screen checks were in the form of\ncorrespondence on city stationary signed either by Carol Jacobs, “City Manager” or\nOmar Dadabhoy, “Community Development Director.”5\n                 Regulations promulgated by the city pursuant to its adult-oriented business\nlicense ordinance in the Stanton Municipal Code provide that it is the city manager who\n“shall investigate” any adult-oriented use application, and further provide that the city\nmanager is to grant the license within 20 days after the application is filed unless the city\nmanager finds the business does not comply with some provision in the municipal code.\n                 Given the procedural posture of this case (as the party responding to a\ndemurrer, Madain gets the benefit of the doubt, not the city) we express no opinion on the\nmerits of these correction requests, except to note Madain stated in a declaration that a\nnumber of them were brought up at later stages in the process than necessary. According\n\n       5        These letters are part of a motion in trial court docket number 30-2009-00119013 case, which\nMadain made in January 2012 to compel the city council to immediately issue his requested permit.\n\n\n                                                       8\n\fto Madain (we need not opine on the merits of the point) the requests were nothing more\nthan nit-picking.\n              On January 11, 2012, just a few weeks after the fifth screen check had been\nsent to Madain in December 2011, and before the final, sixth, screen check would be sent\nout on January 17, Madain brought a motion in the trial court to require the city to\nimmediately issue him a permit. The hearing was scheduled for February 10, 2012, but,\non January 26, the city’s planning division gave its approval to his plans. Madain,\narguing against the city’s position that his motion was by then moot, asserted that he had\nrequested the city to hire an independent company to oversee the approval process, a\nrequest that had been accepted, but only after the city had “road blocked the project at\nevery turn” during the previous year.\n              The motion went off calendar on February 10. The record discloses no\nfurther activity in the Madain I case until some five months later, on July 11, 2012. At\nthat point, Madain’s business was about to open. With new counsel, he took the step of\nfiling a motion for leave to file an amended petition to assert a request for some $3\nmillion in delay damages, and add two individuals, Dadabhoy and Jacobs, to the petition.\nNew material to be added to the petition included a statement that pursuant to both\nsection 1095 and section 1983 Madain was entitled to recover damages from the city for\nits delay going back to late 2008.\n              The same day (July 11, 2012) Madain filed a new action (trial court docket\nnumber 30-2012-00582698, or “Madain II” as the parties call in the briefs) which was a\nstraight-on “complaint for damages pursuant to CCP § 1095.” This original complaint\ncentered on the “litany” of “stall tactics” allegedly engaged in by the city in 2011, but\ndoes not contain any reference to section 1983. (That would soon change.)\n              Meanwhile, in Madain I, Madain’s motion for leave to file an amended\npetition was denied in a minute order authored by the trial judge then assigned to the\ncase, Judge David Chaffee, dated October 25, 2012. The thrust of the minute order was\n\n                                              9\n\fthat because our opinion in Madain I did not mention the issue of damages, no damages\ncould be recovered thereafter.6 In response to the point that the issue of damages was\npremature in the wake of Madain I, the minute order reasoned that under section 1095\ndamages was “not an issue that can be brought up after damages has [sic] been entered.”\nThe court furthered reasoned that section 1095 requires any damages determination “take\nplace in one proceeding.”\n                 The minute order said: “As written, the Judgment is construed as resolving\nall issues. Reopening a Judgment and purporting to continue the case and permit further\nproceedings is in excess of the court’s jurisdiction. Delmuto v. Superior Court (1932)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3288961\"><a href=\"/opinion/3290391/delmuto-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Therefore, amendment at this juncture can’t occur.” The judge\nfurther concluded the language in the judgment (apparently referring to the August 27,\n2010 judgment) saying the case could be restored to civil calendar “[p]erhaps” applied to\nmotions concerning the costs memo or attorney’s fees, but “the issues of damages were\nresolved.”7\n                 Judge Chaffee added that damages incurred since the original writ petition\n(trial court docket number 30-2009-00119013, or Madain I) could not be a part of the\nexisting judgment. Rather, those damages were the subject of an “entirely new action.”\nThe same went for the two individuals to be named in the amended petition, Dadabhoy\nand Jacobs, given that there were no “Doe” allegations in the original petition.\nMoreover, the delay as to those individuals was “unexplained and prejudicial.”\n\n\n\n        6          We quote the salient portion of the minute order:\n                   “The Court of Appeal Opinion did not include any consideration of, or reference to, damages. The\nCourt’s order denying the writ of mandate was reversed but the directions were limited to ‘issue a writ of mandamus\nrequiring the City to vacate its denial of Mandain’s [sic] permit application and reconsider the matter, including\nMandain’s [sic] contention he was ready to file his adult-oriented business application on December 2, 2008.\nAppellant to recover his costs on appeal.’ This order formed the basis of the Court’s Judgment, which did not refer\nto damages.”\n         7         He elaborated at the end of the minute order: “Judgment was entered in this case on 08/27/10.\nDamages were not included in the Judgment and were not included in the Court of Appeal’s opinion. The Judgment\ndisposes of all issues of the Petition. Therefore, there is no Petition remaining to amend.”\n\n\n                                                        10\n\f                  The battle then shifted to the new action (trial docket number 2698, aka\nMadain II), with the city’s demurrer filed in mid-November. The city argued the new\naction was barred by res judicata, at least for those damages incurred up to the judgment\nin Madain I, barred by the six-month Government Tort claims statute of limitations (with\nthe accrual beginning December 2, 2008), and in any event precluded by the statutory\nimmunity for permit delay under Government Code section 821.2.\n                  Meanwhile, back on the Madain I front, Madain filed a notice of appeal\nfrom the October 25, 2012 minute order, denying the motion to amend the original\npetition in Madain I. This is the G047717 docket number appeal referenced in our\ncaption.\n                  Before the demurrer in Madain II could be heard, Madain filed a first\namended complaint. Unlike the original, this one did include an explicit request for\ndamages under the federal statute, section 1983. This amended pleading included as\nindividual defendants city planning manager Dadabhoy, city manager Jacobs, and Kelly\nScott.\n                  The first amended complaint pled alternative theories regarding the actions\nof the individual defendants. On the one hand, the first amended complaint asserted that\nthe city was the “‘moving force’” behind the deprivation of Madain’s equal protection,\ndue process and free speech rights as detailed in the obstacles he had faced from the city.\nOn the other hand, it asserted that Dadabhoy, Jacobs and Scott were “rogue municipal\nemployees” who had used their positions at city hall to violate Madain’s civil rights.8\n\n\n\n\n          8        The first amended complaint does not use the phrase “official policy” to describe the city’s various\nattempts to stop or otherwise delay Madain’s business, instead saying the city was the “moving force” behind those\nattempts. The “moving force” image is derived from Kentucky v. Graham (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166. That passage\nreads in pertinent part: “On the merits, to establish personal liability in a § 1983 action, it is enough to show that the\nofficial, acting under color of state law, caused the deprivation of a federal right. . . . More is required in an\nofficial-capacity action, however, for a governmental entity is liable under § 1983 only when the entity itself is a\n‘“moving force’” behind the deprivation . . . .”\n\n\n                                                           11\n\fBeyond the general allegation of rogueness, however, the complaint does not explain how\nDadabhoy, Jacobs and Scott delayed Madain’s permit.\n                  The city demurred again, arguing Madain’s delay claims were barred by res\njudicata by virtue of a final judgment in Madain I. The city also asserted that various\nstatutes of limitations, statutory immunity, and lack of any allegation the delay was a\nresult of “official policy” or “action or ratification by an official with final policy-making\nauthority” or “custom or practice allowing or condoning the action” all precluded any\nliability on any defendant’s part. The demurrer also noted that Madain had pled mutually\nexclusive theories of liability as to the city on the one hand and the three individual\ndefendants on the other.\n                  The demurrer was sustained in late February 2013 in a minute order made\nby the new judge assigned to the case, Geoffrey Glass. However, the denial was with\nleave to amend. The minute order said it was unclear who Madain was suing on various\nsection 1983 causes of action, though it “appear[ed]” Madain was suing Stanton on a\nrespondeat superior theory.” But, said the trial judge, respondeat superior clearly does\nnot apply to section 1983 causes of action. Likewise, he concluded that Madain had\nfailed to “identify the ‘official policy’ that caused the individual defendants to violate the\nconstitution.” The judge further noted the fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action “are\ncompletely contradictory to the allegations in the rest of the complaint.”9\n                  Rather than amend, Madain stipulated to dismissal of Madain II in early\nApril 2013, then filed a notice of appeal from the order of dismissal almost immediately\nafter. A month later, on May 3, 2013, a formal judgment of dismissal was entered,\ncuring the technical prematurity of Madain’s mid-April notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n\n         9        As drafted, Madain has listed three section 1983 causes of action, corresponding to free speech,\nequal protection and due process.\n\n\n                                                         12\n\f                                         DISCUSSION\nA. The First Appeal: Madain I (G047717). Dismissed\n               Each party sees the appeal from the order of October 12, 2012 differently.\nFor Madain, the first appeal is from a postjudgment order which raises issues different\nfrom those addressed in the underlying judgment. For the city, the first appeal is from a\npostjudgment order that merely raises the same issues already disposed of in an\nunderlying final judgment.\n               We don’t agree with either analysis. Both rely on an erroneous premise.\nThe “judgment” of August 27, 2010, was not a final, appealable judgment. That\ndocument clearly left issues for further consideration beyond mere compliance. “‘As a\ngeneral test, which must be adapted to the particular circumstances of the individual case,\nit may be said that where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of\ncompliance or noncompliance with the terms of the first decree, that decree is final, but\nwhere anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential\nto a final determination of the rights of the parties, the decree is interlocutory.’” (Griset\nv.

(2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 698; see also Eisenberg et al.,\nCal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 2013) ¶ 2:37, p. 2-24\n[“The general test of finality focuses on whether and to what extent issues remain to be\ndecided in the lower court case . . . .”].)\n               We may identify at least two issues the judgment of August 27, 2010, left\nfor future consideration. One was the request for a permit itself. Madain’s original\npetition prayed for an injunction that the city be “ordered to grant” him “the adult\noriented business license that [he was] seeking.” The judgment of this court in Madain I,\ndid not give him that relief, but nor did it deny it to him. All it did was give him a\nhearing on the factual question which might – or, just as easily, might not – have\novercome a threshold obstacle as one step in a process which might result in his\nobtaining the “license [he was] seeking.” The trial court’s judgment of August 27, 2010\n\n                                              13\n\f– no proceedings in the trial court had occurred in the interim since our June 2010\nopinion – merely tracked the limited relief Madain had obtained in this court, ordering\nthe city “to set aside its decision of February 10, 2009 and to reconsider [Madain’s]\npetition for the adult oriented business license.” Manifestly, achieving reconsideration of\na step in the process of making a request is not the same as being entitled to what is\nrequested. Accordingly, the August 27, 2010 judgment expressly stated that after the\n“new hearing and decision” by the city, “the matter may, at the request of either party, be\nrestored to the calendar of the Superior Court.”\n              But there was at least one other issue – not even counting Madain’s specific\nrequest for attorney fees under federal law made in the original petition: damages. Both\nthe text of the petition and its prayer sought damages. And, similar to Madain’s request\nfor a permit itself, the issue of damages was contingent on Madain’s first obtaining his\npermit.\n              In other words, under the no-issue-left-for-future consideration” standard of\nGriset, on August 27, 2010, there were miles to go in this case before there could be a\nfinal resolution of the issue of whether Madain would receive – or not receive – the\nlicense he was seeking, or any damages incurred in the process.\n              The fact the August 27, 2010 “judgment” was labeled a “judgment” is not\ndeterminative. Regardless of the label, it is the substance of the document which\ndetermines whether it is a final judgment for purposes of appeal. (Jackson v.

Basically, a couple who owned land in Monterey County sued their water\ncompany for water, and obtained a judgment requiring the company to deliver it to them. (Beatty I, supra, 28\nCal.App. at p. 748.) The water company appealed from “that portion of the judgment” providing for the delivery of\nwater, arguing it wasn’t obligated to supply the water. (Id. at pp. 747-749.) The water company lost, the relevant\nportion of the judgment was affirmed. That was Beatty I.\n                    The water company also filed a separate appeal from an order denying a motion for new trial (and\nalso from the judgment), apparently arguing that the judgment included a lot which was not otherwise owned by the\nplaintiffs. The water company succeeded in obtaining a modification of the judgment to the degree it erroneously\nincluded that lot. (Beatty II, supra, 28 Cal.App. at p. 750.) That was Beatty II.\n                    Finally, the plaintiffs filed their own, separate appeal from that “portion” of the same judgment\nwhich declined to award them damages. (Beatty III, supra, 28 Cal.App. at pp. 752-753.) The court held that the\n“undisputed evidence” entitled them to damages for past delay on the water company’s part, and therefore “that\nportion” of the judgment should be reversed to let them try their damages issue “anew.” (Id. at p. 753.) That was\nBeatty III, which is the case the trial judge here mentioned in his minute order.\n\n\n                                                           15\n\fotherwise final judgment not to include a provision for damages, and that omission is\ngrounds for reversal in a timely appeal by the plaintiff from that judgment. (See id. at p.\n753.) Beatty III does not affect this case because it arose out of a judgment which\nprovided for the plaintiffs to obtain a writ of mandate giving them the substantive relief\nthey sought – an order that a water company deliver water to them – but which\nerroneously omitted to address their request for damages as a result of the water\ncompany’s past failure to deliver water to them. That omission was redressed in a\nsuccessful appeal by the plaintiffs from the “portion” of the judgment from which they\nappealed. (Ibid.) The August 27, 2010 judgment in the case before us, by contrast, did\nnot give Madain the substantive relief he sought. It only gave him the further opportunity\nto pursue that relief. Therefore it cannot be assumed that the damages issue was\nnecessarily included in the August 27, 2010 judgment. It wasn’t. By August 2010, it\nhadn’t been established that Madain was entitled to any substantive relief sought in\noriginal petition, because it remained possible the city might prevail on its factual\nassertion that Madain didn’t try to file his application on December 2, 2008.\n                  Finally, Delmuto v. Superior Court (1932) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3288961\"><a href=\"/opinion/3290391/delmuto-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Delmuto is inapt here because there the long final judgment clearly left no\nissues for future consideration, it just got one of those issues (the liability of a negligent\nminor participating in a race) wrong.11 Delmuto cannot be read, as the trial judge read it\nhere, for the idea that our decision in Madain I necessarily “resolv[ed] all issues.” As we\n\n         11        Delmuto involved three young automobile drivers who were racing each other. One was injured\nand sued the other two. The case went to trial, with the judge finding that the racer who was a minor was negligent;\nthe other racer, not a minor, was not. The judgment, however, only provided that the plaintiff take damages from\nthe defendant minor’s mother, and, inexplicably, expressly provided that the plaintiff take nothing as against the\nminor himself. Three years after the judgment became final – in the depths of the Great Depression – the plaintiff\nsought to amend the court’s conclusions of law to reopen the case against the minor. And the trial court granted his\nrequest. The Court of Appeal had little difficulty concluding the order was in excess of the trial court’s jurisdiction.\n(Delmuto, supra, 119 Cal.App. at pp. 594-595.)\n\n\n                                                          16\n\fsaid, it didn’t. Madain I did not even reach the main issue of substantive relief sought in\nMadain’s original pleading.\n              So what are we to make of the order of October 25, 2012, denying the\nrequest to amend the original petition? This is where it gets complicated.\n              An order denying a request to amend a pleading prior to a final judgment is\nitself not appealable unless the order has the effect of eliminating all issues, so there is\nnothing left to be tried or determined.

Even assuming, for sake of argument, that the\nquestion of Madain’s underlying right to a permit had already been eliminated because it\nwas moot (since he already received his permit back in January of the same year), the\nissue of damages still remained. We hadn’t resolved that issue in Madain I – to repeat,\nbecause we couldn’t. And beyond damages, the issue of attorney fees remained as well.\n              In substance then, the August 27, 2010 “judgment” and the October 25,\n2012 denial order were both interlocutory and not appealable.

Unfortunately, case law is clear that this power should\nbe reserved for “unusual” cases. (H.D. Arnaiz, Ltd. v. County of San Joaquin (2002) 96\n\n                                               </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Since Madain did not make a formal request\nin his briefing that would have explained how his case called for the unusual remedy he\nalluded to at argument and allowed the city to respond to it, we decline to treat his appeal\nas a de facto writ petition. The good news for the city is that the appeal in G047717 must\ntherefore be dismissed. The bad news for the city is that Madain I remains a case where\nthe issue of damages and attorney fees have not yet been adjudicated, and in which there\nis yet no final judgment. Further proceedings will be required before the case can be laid\nto rest.\nB. The Second Appeal: Madain II (G048323). Split Decision.\n              Madain II is a different matter. Procedurally it is much cleaner. Given the\njudgment of dismissal filed May 3, 2013, there is no doubt about appealability. We have\na straightforward case of a sustained demurrer where the plaintiff elected not to amend,\neliminating all issues between the parties, and thus presenting a cleanly appealable\njudgment.\n              Preliminarily, it is important to recognize that Madain has alleged\nalternative, and indeed inconsistent, theories as to the origins of the delays he has\nencountered. And, indeed, that is his right under California law. As the court said in\nMendoza v. Continental Sales Co. (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1395</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1402: “When a pleader\nis in doubt about what actually occurred or what can be established by the evidence, the\nmodern practice allows that party to plead in the alternative and make inconsistent\nallegations.” (Accord, Adams v.

Thus he has alleged that either\nthe delays were the result of rogue city employees acting on their own, or as the result of\na deliberate city effort which was the “moving force” behind those delays.\n              The city raises a number of valid points which have the effect of\nwinnowing down Madain’s delay claim to a bare minimum. First, we note the city’s\n\n                                             18\n\fstatutory immunity argument is a correct one as to state law. All state law delay claims\nare based on section 1095, which provides for damages for a successful litigant seeking a\nwrit of administrate mandate. But section 1095 is, when it comes to delay damages\nincurred in obtaining land use permits, in direct conflict with Government Code sections\n818.4 and 821.2. Those two statutes effectively insulate public entities and public\nemployees from liability for failure to issue permits. Case law squarely holds the two\nGovernment Code sections trump the more general Civil Procedure Code section. (See\nLopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1206919\"><a href=\"/opinion/1206919/lopez-v-southern-cal-rapid-transit-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 804 [observing\n“imposing liability on the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 1095 would be\ntantamount to a repeal of sections 818.4 and 821.2]; O’Hagan v.

This is, of course, in direct conflict with the applicable provisions of the Tort\nClaims Act which provide a clear-cut immunity for discretionary acts in general . . . and\nfor licensing activities in particular . . . .

(See Williams v.

So, we must now turn to the city’s statute of limitations\nargument as it applies to section 1983 claims.\n              As a matter of federal law, section 1983 carries the same statute of\nlimitations as the state personal injury statute of limitations in the state where the alleged\n\n                                              19\n\fcivil rights violation occurred. “The United States Supreme Court has held that an action\nbrought pursuant to . . . section 1983 is a personal injury action, and that the appropriate\nstatute of limitations is the statute of limitations for personal injury causes of action in\nthe particular state in which the case is filed.” (See Jackson v. Cedars-Sinai Medical\nCenter (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2143356\"><a href=\"/opinion/2143356/jackson-v-cedars-sinai-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1323.) The current state personal injury statute of\nlimitations is within two years of the injury-causing wrongful act. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 335.1.)\n              As to the statute of limitations, any “delay” injuries caused either by the\ncity, or arguendo by any employees going “rogue,” must be divided, as Judge Chaffee\nnoted in his minute order, into two separate categories: (1) the delay attendant on the\ninitial denial of Madain’s permit application on February 10, 2009, as set out in the facts\nin Madain I, and (2) the delay attendant on any unreasonableness in the city’s processing\nof Madain’s tenant improvement and application in the year 2011, in the aftermath of our\ndecision in Madain I.\n              As to the first period, the statute of limitations has already run. Madain II\nwas filed in July 2012. The delay attendant on the denial of Madain’s application\noccurred in February 2009 – more than three years previously. The city, we would also\nobserve, had every right to use legal process to defend its decision in the courts\nafterward, so that period of delay certainly cannot be charged to it. (See generally\nManta Management Corp. v. City of San Bernardino (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634363\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634363/mamta-management-v-city-of-san-bernardino/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408 [city’s\nseeking preliminary injunction against operation of an adult cabaret and later an appellate\nstay after the dissolution of the preliminary injunction were not acts for which city could\nbe held responsible].) And Madain has proffered no argument on appeal that the time\nconsumed in the appellate proceeding that resulted in Madain I tolls the two-year statute\nof limitations as a matter of federal law under section 1983. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat all section 1983 claims set forth in Madain II that derive from the city’s February\n2009 denial of his permit are precluded by the statute of limitations.\n\n                                              20\n\f                  That leaves only the second period of delay – caused by the alleged\nnitpicking of tenant improvement plans in the year 2011 – as a statute of limitations issue.\nWe may observe at this point that a city’s unreasonable bureaucratic delay in processing\na benefit to which a litigant is otherwise entitled can indeed be the basis of a valid section\n1983 claim for violation of due process rights. (See Kraebel v. New York City\nDepartment of Housing Preservation and Development (2d Cir. 1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579953\"><a href=\"/opinion/579953/barbara-kraebel-dba-barklee-realty-company-v-new-york-city-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n405.12).) We cannot see why the same rule would not also apply to a business permit as\nto which an applicant may claim first amendment protection. And, since Madain II was\nfiled well within two years of 2011, claims based on the second period of delay survive a\nstatute of limitations challenge.\n                  We now consider the city’s main argument, and the one that primarily\nanimated the trial court’s sustaining of the city’s demurrer, namely that Madain has not\nalleged that the delay in 2011 was part of some city “policy” to discourage adult\nbusinesses by the device of unreasonable processing of tenant improvement minutiae –\nthe “death of a thousand screen checks approach” to killing an undesired land use.\n                  The “policy” argument derives from Monell v.

If there\n\n\n          12       Kraebel presents a fairly close parallel with this case on the point of whether bureaucratic nit-\npicking and repetitive review can trigger a viable section 1983 claim. The case involved a landlord who undertook\nextensive voluntary and, for her, costly improvements to her apartment building in reliance on a city program that\npromised her property tax breaks in return. (Kraebel, supra, 959 F.2d at p. 398.) But to gain the tax breaks, the\nlandlord had to submit applications for tax exemptions and abatements. Those applications were “subjected to\nrepetitive reviews by numerous people, several of whom demanded further documentation that was not even\nrequired” by the regulations promulgated in connection with the city program. (Id. at p. 398.) It took the city a year\nand half to process her applications. (Ibid.) The appellate court reversed the district court’s federal rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissal of her due process claim, stating “due process requires that eligibility for a variety of benefits be processed\nwithin a reasonable time” (id. at p. 405) because “‘implicit in the conferral of an entitlement is a further entitlement\nto receive the entitlement within a reasonable time.’” (Ibid., quoting Schroeder v. City of Chicago (7th Cir. 1991)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557242\"><a href=\"/opinion/557242/bernard-schroeder-v-city-of-chicago-john-j-tully-and-audley-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960.) The court further held that while delay is natural with an administrative bureaucracy, there was\n“at least a question of fact as to whether these delays were egregious and without rational justification.” (Kraebel,\nsupra, 959 F.2d at p. 405.)\n\n\n                                                           21\n\fis any pattern to Monell decisional law, it is a crazy quilt.” However, for our purposes,\nwe can distill Monell into one sentence: Local governments are not liable under section\n1983 pursuant to the classic doctrine of respondeat superior; local governments can only\nbe held liable if the civil rights violation is the result of city policy, custom, or practice.\n               That much seems clear. But again, we are forced to make separate\nanalyses, this time because of the mutually exclusive alternative allegations made in the\ncomplaint. The complaint alleges, as one alternative scenario, that three city employees,\nDadabhoy, Jacobs and Scott, acting on their own, caused the delays in obtaining the\npermit, including those occurring during the city’s allegedly unreasonable bureaucratic\nprocessing of tenant improvement plans in 2011. The Monell policy argument has no\nforce as to these three, since they are alleged to have violated Madain’s rights on their\nown. And individual city employees can indeed be held liable under section 1983 for\ntheir own conduct under color of state law. (E.g., Starr v. Baca (9th Cir. 2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207-1208 [county sheriff could be individually liable for deliberate indifference to\nbrutality to prisoners in county jail by subordinates].) The city’s argument that any\nattempt to hold the three individuals liable is res judicata fails because Madain I is not res\njudicata, since there is no final judgment in it yet.\n               However, as to at least one of the three individual defendants, Kelly Scott,\nthere is a problem of insufficient facts alleged to show she did anything in 2011 which\nhad anything to do with the case. Mere conclusions are not sufficient to state a section\n1983 claim. (See Kennedy v. H & M Landing, Inc. (9th Cir. 1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"332994\"><a href=\"/opinion/332994/edward-kennedy-v-h-m-landing-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 989 [“A\npleading will not be sufficient to state a claim under the Civil Rights Act if the allegations\nare mere conclusions.”].) Neither the first amended complaint, nor the 2011 screen check\nletters (trial court docket number 30-2009-00119013), of which we may take judicial\nnotice (for purposes of the case of trial court docket number 30-2012-00582698),\nmention her in any way, and we cannot find evidence or theory to support a section 1983\nclaim against her.\n\n                                               22\n\f                  We cannot, however, say the same about Jacobs and Dadabhoy, whose\nfingerprints are all over the allegedly unnecessarily repetitive screen check letters. Is\nenough alleged to say they were going “rogue”? It is true that the Stanton Municipal\nCode delegated to the city manager the power to deny an adult-oriented business\napplication upon a determination the application in some way does not comply with some\npart of the city’s municipal code. But that delegation does not allow us to say, at the\ndemurrer stage, that necessarily Jacobs or Dadabhoy were acting pursuant to city policy\nin sending out those repetitive screen checks and not pursuant to some personal agenda.\n                  After all, the city manager is not the highest decision-making authority on\nthe denial. It is the Stanton city council that has the highest decision-making authority on\nthe issuance of adult-oriented business permits. From that fact it follows – apologies for\nthe double negative – that we cannot say the delays of 2011 were necessarily not the\nproduct of some personal agendas on the part of Jacobs or Dadabhoy or both.
