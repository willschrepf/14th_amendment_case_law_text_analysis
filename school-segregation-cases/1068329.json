Carter, District Judge, Presiding\n\n                        Argued and Submitted April 6, 2010\n                               Pasadena, California\n\nBefore: PREGERSON and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges, and GRAHAM,2 District\nJudge.\n\n\nI.    Introduction\n\n      EchoStar and NDS appeal the district court’s award of attorneys’ fees and\n\ncosts. EchoStar challenges the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs awarded to it\n\nby the district court. Conversely, NDS challenges the amount of attorneys’ fees\n\nand costs awarded to it, and the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs awarded to\n\nEchoStar. The district court awarded attorneys’ fees to EchoStar in the amount of\n\n$12,972,547.91, plus reasonable costs, and awarded attorneys’ fees to NDS in the\n\namount of $8,968,118.90, and no costs. For the reasons that follow, we REVERSE\n\nand REMAND with instructions.\n\nII.   Standard of Review\n\n      This court reviews a district court’s award of attorneys’ fees and costs for an\n\nabuse of discretion. P.N. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 474 F.3d 1165, 1168 (9th Cir.\n\n      2\n       The Honorable James L. Graham, District Judge for the Southern District\nof Ohio, sitting by designation.\n\n                                          2\n\f2007). A district court abuses its discretion if its ruling on a fee motion is based on\n\nan inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact. Richard S. v.\n\nDep’t of Developmental Servs. of Cal., 317 F.3d 1080, 1085-86 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\nThus, any element of legal analysis and statutory interpretation underlying the\n\ndistrict court’s attorneys’ fees decision is reviewed de novo, and factual findings\n\nunderlying the district court’s decision are reviewed for clear error. Barrios v. Cal.\n\nInterscholastic Fed’n, 277 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\nIII.   Discussion\n\n       It is clear to us that this case, which involved over half a decade of litigation\n\nand a four week trial, was about the compromise of EchoStar’s satellite television\n\nprogramming security system due to the December 2000 Internet posting and\n\nrelated conduct, not the P1 Test. EchoStar sought actual damages and lost profits\n\ntotaling approximately $184.8 million, $823 million in disgorgement penalties, and\n\nstatutory damages of $1 billion. All of EchoStar’s claims were based on the\n\nallegation that NDS was responsible for the compromise of EchoStar’s security\n\nsystem, which caused EchoStar to spend over $94 million to replace all of its\n\naccess cards with new cards that used a different encryption technology. As stated\n\nby EchoStar in support of its motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, “Each of\n\nEchoStar’s claims was premised on the same core set of facts – that NDS engaged\n\n\n                                           3\n\fin unfair and unlawful business practices through conduct that compromised the\n\nintegrity of EchoStar’s security system.” In other posttrial briefing, EchoStar\n\ncharacterized the P1 Test as an “inconsequential fact discussed briefly with few\n\nwitnesses.” In sum, this case was about the massive breach of EchoStar’s security\n\nsystem, not the P1 Test.\n\n      The P1 Test was an incidental event, unrelated to the December 2000\n\nposting. It was a technical violation of the Communications Act and the California\n\nPenal Code, and involved a single, unauthorized interception of EchoStar’s signal\n\nin a test of a piracy method. As a result of this interception, the jury awarded to\n\nEchoStar actual damages of $45.69 (which were trebled pursuant to statute), and\n\n$1,500 in statutory damages, and the court awarded to EchoStar $284.94 in\n\nrestitution and issued a permanent injunction against NDS prohibiting it from again\n\nengaging in the illegal conduct found by the jury.\n\n      The district court determined that the jury rejected EchoStar’s theory that\n\nNDS was responsible for the December 2000 Internet posting, and that the\n\nviolation findings were based on the evidence of the P1 Test. We agree. The\n\njury’s express findings, particularly its actual damages award of $45.69,\n\nnecessarily lead to the conclusion that the jury rejected EchoStar’s exclusive theory\n\nat trial that NDS was responsible for the December 2000 posting and its aftermath,\n\n\n                                          4\n\fbut found that NDS illegally intercepted EchoStar’s programming signal by\n\nconducting the P1 Test. EchoStar’s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.\n\n      As a matter of law, we conclude that, for the purpose of awarding attorneys’\n\nfees and costs, NDS was the prevailing party in this litigation and that EchoStar\n\nfails to meet the legal definition of a prevailing party on any of its claims.\n\n      California case law provides that, in the absence of contrary legislative\n\ndirection, a trial court must determine prevailing party status using a “pragmatic”\n\napproach to determine whether a party prevailed “on a practical level.” See\n\nDonner Mgmt. Co. v. Schaffer, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 534, 542-43 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006).\n\nUnless a statute provides otherwise, California courts reject a “rigid definition of\n\nprevailing party.” Id.\n\n      Under federal law, a “prevailing party” is one that succeeds “ ‘on any\n\nsignificant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought\n\nin bringing suit.’ ” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) (quoting\n\nNadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1978)). A litigant qualifies as\n\na prevailing party if it has obtained a “court-ordered ‘change [in] the legal\n\nrelationship between [the plaintiff] and the defendant.’ ” Buckhannon Bd. & Care\n\nHome, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 604 (2001)\n\n(alterations in original) (quoting Tex. State Teachers Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch.\n\n\n                                           5\n\fDist., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989)). “ ‘Where the plaintiff’s success on a legal claim\n\ncan be characterized as purely technical or de minimis,’ ” the plaintiff cannot\n\nrecover fees as a prevailing party. Parents of Student W. v. Puyallup Sch. Dist.,\n\nNo. 3, 31 F.3d 1489, 1498 (9th Cir. 1994) (quoting Tex. State Teachers Ass’n, 489\n\nU.S. at 792). But “[t]he touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the\n\nmaterial alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which\n\nCongress sought to promote in the fee statute. Where such a change has occurred,\n\nthe degree of the plaintiff’s overall success goes to the reasonableness of the award\n\nunder Hensley, not to the availability of a fee award vel non.” Tex. State Teachers\n\nAss’n, 489 U.S. at 792-93. That is, “the prevailing party inquiry does not turn on\n\nthe magnitude of the relief obtained.” Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 114 (1992).\n\n      Simply stated, EchoStar did not prevail “on a practical level” on the claims\n\nunder the California Penal Code because those claims were based on the December\n\n2000 Internet posting and were rejected by the jury. Likewise, for similar reasons,\n\nEchoStar did not succeed “on any significant issue” or “achieve any of the benefit\n\nit sought in bringing suit” under the Communications Act.\n\n      Even if we were to hold that EchoStar was a prevailing party on claims\n\nunder these statutes based upon the P1 Test, we note that, in the four week trial,\n\nonly two witnesses briefly testified about the P1 Test, and that EchoStar has not\n\n\n                                          6\n\feven attempted to identify the specific amount of attorneys’ fees or costs\n\nattributable to proving these violations, which, in any event, would surely be a de\n\nminimis amount. Although EchoStar did obtain injunctive relief under the\n\nCalifornia Business and Professions Code, we agree with the district court’s\n\ndetermination that, as a matter of law, attorneys’ fees are not available under the\n\nCalifornia Unfair Competition Law.\n\n      By the same reasoning, we find that NDS was the prevailing party on\n\nEchoStar’s claims under the California Penal Code and the Communications Act,\n\nwhich award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. There is no question that NDS\n\nsuccessfully defended against all of EchoStar’s claims based on or related to its\n\ntheory that NDS was responsible for the compromise of EchoStar’s satellite\n\ntelevision programming security system, including its Digital Millennium\n\nCopyright Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and Lanham\n\nAct claims.3 Furthermore, insofar as EchoStar obtained a jury finding that NDS\n\n      3\n        The district court properly disallowed NDS’s request for attorneys’ fees\nunder the Lanham Act but did not attempt to segregate the award of attorney time\ndevoted to the defense of these claims. See Cairns v. Franklin Mint Co., 292 F.3d\n1139, 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2002) (suggesting that a court must attempt to apportion\nattorneys’ fees between Lanham Act claims, for which the litigant is not entitled to\nattorneys’ fees, and non-Lanham Act claims, for which the litigant is entitled to\nattorneys’ fees, even if the claims involve a “common core of facts” or are based\non “related legal theories”). We note, however, that the Lanham Act claims were\ndenied on a motion for summary judgment that devoted only two pages of briefing\nto them. Since the operative facts forming the basis of the Lanham Act claims\n\n                                          7\n\fviolated the Communications Act and the California Penal Code on the basis of the\n\nP1 Test, the overwhelming success of NDS in its defense of EchoStar’s lawsuit\n\nwas trivially mitigated. If found liable for the December 2000 Internet posting and\n\nits aftermath, NDS faced the possibility of paying nearly $2 billion in damages.\n\nInstead, NDS was held liable for less than $2,000 in damages, and was prohibited\n\nfrom again engaging in conduct whose occurrence it never challenged.\n\n      EchoStar requested attorneys’ fees in the amount of $15,945,095.81, and\n\nNDS requested attorneys’ fees in the amount of $23,914,983.74. In its decision\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees and costs, the district court implicitly found that the rates\n\ncharged by the attorneys on both sides of the litigation were reasonable and that\n\nboth parties “presented work of a similar quality.” But the district court found that\n\nNDS had not shown why it was necessary for it to spend “significantly more hours\n\non this litigation than EchoStar did[.]” The district court has broad discretion in\n\ndetermining the amount of attorneys’ fees reasonably required to accomplish a\n\nresult. Judge Carter is a well-seasoned trial judge who presided throughout this\n\nlengthy and complicated litigation. His decision to reduce NDS’s attorneys’ fees\n\n\n\nwere intertwined with the rest of EchoStar’s claims and required minimal legal\nargument to achieve their dismissal, we see no practical reason to ask the district\ncourt to attempt to separate out the attorneys’ fees attributable to them. We will\ninstead consider them to fall within the 25% reduction of NDS’s fees ordered by\nthe district court.\n\n                                           8\n\fby 25% was well within his discretion. A 25% reduction from NDS’s requested\n\n$23,914,983.74 in attorneys’ fees equals $17,936,237.80.\n\nIV.   Conclusion\n\n      The judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and this matter is\n\nREMANDED to the district court with instructions to enter judgment denying\n\nEchoStar’s request for attorneys’ fees and costs, and awarding attorneys’ fees to\n\nNDS in the amount of $17,936,237.80, and reasonable costs. The costs of this\n\nappeal are awarded against EchoStar.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f",

As a result of this interception, the jury awarded to\n\nEchoStar actual damages of $45.69 (which were trebled pursuant to statute), and\n\n$1,500 in statutory damages, and the court awarded to EchoStar $284.94 in\n\nrestitution and issued a permanent injunction against NDS prohibiting it from again\n\nengaging in the illegal conduct found by the jury.\n\n      The district court determined that the jury rejected EchoStar’s theory that\n\nNDS was responsible for the December 2000 Internet posting, and that the\n\nviolation findings were based on the evidence of the P1 Test. We agree. The\n\njury’s express findings, particularly its actual damages award of $45.69,\n\nnecessarily lead to the conclusion that the jury rejected EchoStar’s exclusive theory\n\nat trial that NDS was responsible for the December 2000 posting and its aftermath,\n\n\n                                          4\n\fbut found that NDS illegally intercepted EchoStar’s programming signal by\n\nconducting the P1 Test. EchoStar’s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.\n\n      As a matter of law, we conclude that, for the purpose of awarding attorneys’\n\nfees and costs, NDS was the prevailing party in this litigation and that EchoStar\n\nfails to meet the legal definition of a prevailing party on any of its claims.\n\n      California case law provides that, in the absence of contrary legislative\n\ndirection, a trial court must determine prevailing party status using a “pragmatic”\n\napproach to determine whether a party prevailed “on a practical level.” See\n\nDonner Mgmt.

Likewise, for similar reasons,\n\nEchoStar did not succeed “on any significant issue” or “achieve any of the benefit\n\nit sought in bringing suit” under the Communications Act.\n\n      Even if we were to hold that EchoStar was a prevailing party on claims\n\nunder these statutes based upon the P1 Test, we note that, in the four week trial,\n\nonly two witnesses briefly testified about the P1 Test, and that EchoStar has not\n\n\n                                          6\n\feven attempted to identify the specific amount of attorneys’ fees or costs\n\nattributable to proving these violations, which, in any event, would surely be a de\n\nminimis amount. Although EchoStar did obtain injunctive relief under the\n\nCalifornia Business and Professions Code, we agree with the district court’s\n\ndetermination that, as a matter of law, attorneys’ fees are not available under the\n\nCalifornia Unfair Competition Law.\n\n      By the same reasoning, we find that NDS was the prevailing party on\n\nEchoStar’s claims under the California Penal Code and the Communications Act,\n\nwhich award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. There is no question that NDS\n\nsuccessfully defended against all of EchoStar’s claims based on or related to its\n\ntheory that NDS was responsible for the compromise of EchoStar’s satellite\n\ntelevision programming security system, including its Digital Millennium\n\nCopyright Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and Lanham\n\nAct claims.3 Furthermore, insofar as EchoStar obtained a jury finding that NDS\n\n      3\n        The district court properly disallowed NDS’s request for attorneys’ fees\nunder the Lanham Act but did not attempt to segregate the award of attorney time\ndevoted to the defense of these claims. See Cairns v. Franklin Mint Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777933\"><a href=\"/opinion/777933/lord-simon-cairns-john-eversley-michael-gibbons-lvo-fca-jp-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2002) (suggesting that a court must attempt to apportion\nattorneys’ fees between Lanham Act claims, for which the litigant is not entitled to\nattorneys’ fees, and non-Lanham Act claims, for which the litigant is entitled to\nattorneys’ fees, even if the claims involve a “common core of facts” or are based\non “related legal theories”). We note, however, that the Lanham Act claims were\ndenied on a motion for summary judgment that devoted only two pages of briefing\nto them. Since the operative facts forming the basis of the Lanham Act claims\n\n                                          7\n\fviolated the Communications Act and the California Penal Code on the basis of the\n\nP1 Test, the overwhelming success of NDS in its defense of EchoStar’s lawsuit\n\nwas trivially mitigated. If found liable for the December 2000 Internet posting and\n\nits aftermath, NDS faced the possibility of paying nearly $2 billion in damages.\n\nInstead, NDS was held liable for less than $2,000 in damages, and was prohibited\n\nfrom again engaging in conduct whose occurrence it never challenged.\n\n      EchoStar requested attorneys’ fees in the amount of $15,945,095.81, and\n\nNDS requested attorneys’ fees in the amount of $23,914,983.74. In its decision\n\nawarding attorneys’ fees and costs, the district court implicitly found that the rates\n\ncharged by the attorneys on both sides of the litigation were reasonable and that\n\nboth parties “presented work of a similar quality.” But the district court found that\n\nNDS had not shown why it was necessary for it to spend “significantly more hours\n\non this litigation than EchoStar did[.]” The district court has broad discretion in\n\ndetermining the amount of attorneys’ fees reasonably required to accomplish a\n\nresult. Judge Carter is a well-seasoned trial judge who presided throughout this\n\nlengthy and complicated litigation. His decision to reduce NDS’s attorneys’ fees\n\n\n\nwere intertwined with the rest of EchoStar’s claims and required minimal legal\nargument to achieve their dismissal, we see no practical reason to ask the district\ncourt to attempt to separate out the attorneys’ fees attributable to them. We will\ninstead consider them to fall within the 25% reduction of NDS’s fees ordered by\nthe district court.\n\n                                           8\n\fby 25% was well within his discretion. A 25% reduction from NDS’s requested\n\n$23,914,983.74 in attorneys’ fees equals $17,936,237.80.\n\nIV.   Conclusion\n\n      The judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and this matter is\n\nREMANDED to the district court with instructions to enter judgment denying\n\nEchoStar’s request for attorneys’ fees and costs, and awarding attorneys’ fees to\n\nNDS in the amount of $17,936,237.80, and reasonable costs. The costs of this\n\nappeal are awarded against EchoStar.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f</pre>",
