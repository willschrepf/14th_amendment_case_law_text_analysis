Appellant filed its brief in this matter on August 27, 2015. Appellees\n\nthen filed their brief in this matter on October 28, 2015. Finally, Appellant filed its\n\nreply brief on November 17, 2015.\n\n      2.     After Appellees filed their brief and Appellant filed its reply brief,\n\nAppellees became aware of additional relevant case law in Cresthaven Nursing\n\nResidence v. Freeman, 134 S.W.3d 214 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, no pet.).\n\n      3.     Because Cresthaven arises from similar facts and involves the expert\n\ntestimony of a family practitioner on the cause of death of a nursing home resident,\n\nlike this appeal, this case is highly relevant and justice requires that Appellees’\n\nbrief be supplemented with this case law.\n\n      4.     Accordingly, pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.7,\n\nAppellees respectfully request the Court grant this motion and supplement\n\nAppellees’ brief with Cresthaven Nursing Residence v. Freeman in support of\n\nAppellees’ arguments.\n\n      5.     A copy of Cresthaven Nursing Residence v. Freeman is attached\n\nhereto as Exhibit “A.”\n\n      WHEREFORE, premises considered, Appellees Patty Patterson and Pamela\n\nBeavers, Individually and as Representatives of the Estate of Mary Ann Davis pray\n\nthat the Court grant Appellees’ Motion to Supplement Case Law in Support of\n\nAppellees’ Brief as requested herein, and for such other and further relief, at law or\n\n\n\nAPPELLEES’ MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT CASE LAW IN SUPPORT OF APPELLEES’ BRIEF - Page 2\n                                                                              Page 2 of 22\n\fin equity, to which Appellees may be justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n                                             CURNUTT & HAFER, L.L.P.\n                                             By: /s/Kelly J.
