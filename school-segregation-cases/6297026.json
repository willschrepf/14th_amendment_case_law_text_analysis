Students attending District schools (“the Intervenors”) intervened in\nthe litigation in 1982, contending that the District had not properly complied\nwith the consent decree. In 2015, the District moved for a finding of unitary\nstatus in the area of faculty and staff employment. The Intervenors objected,\nand after a hearing, the district court granted unitary status. The Intervenors\nnow appeal, and we affirm.\n                           I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n      In July 1970, the United States sued the State of Mississippi and several\nof its school districts, including the District, alleging that they operated school\nsystems that were segregated by race. In August 1970, the district court\nenjoined the District from discriminating based on race, and outlined various\nprocedures designed to end segregation in the District. The 1970 order\naddressed specific areas: faculty and staff assignments, student transfers,\ntransportation, school construction and site selection, and extracurricular\nactivities.\n      In 1982, the Intervenors filed a class action complaint against the\nDistrict for failing to comply with the 1970 order. In 1983, the district court\nentered another decree, outlining further procedures for the District. These\nincluded procedures aimed at employment practices, viz., requiring the\nDistrict to advertise available positions, use standard forms and objective\nrating criteria to review and score applications, and offer positions to the\nhighest-scoring applicant regardless of race. The 1983 decree also required\nthat the District notify the United States and Intervenors of any proposed\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f     Case: 16-60722       Document: 00514338426          Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-60722\nchange to employment procedures. 1 In 2001, the District moved for unitary\nstatus. The Intervenors did not respond, and the United States objected only\nin the area of faculty and staff assignments. The district court denied unitary\nstatus in that area, but granted unitary status in all other areas. 2\n       In 2011, the court entered another consent decree expanding on the\nrequired employment procedures. Specifically, the 2011 decree required that\n(1) the District advertise vacant positions for at least three weeks and post\nthem in specified locations, (2) the District maintain efforts to increase the\nnumber of qualified African-American applicants, (3) the District’s HR\nDirector score applicants using objective criteria and a standard scoring form,\n(4) the principal or superintendent interview the highest-scoring applicants, 3\n(5) the interviewers complete an interview form (attached to the decree) with\nnumerical scores for various criteria, and (6) the District offer the position to\nthe candidate with the highest combined pre- and post-interview scores.\n       The decree generally required the District to interview candidates with\nhigh initial scores. If the District declined to interview an applicant with a\nhigher score than another applicant selected for an interview, the principal or\nSuperintendent had to state in writing why he or she did not interview such\napplicant. The only reasons permitted by the decree for declining to interview\nsuch an applicant were: (1) the applicant declined the interview, (2) the District\ncould not contact the applicant after a prescribed number of attempts, (3) based\non information disclosed in a prior interview, reference check, background, or\nmisrepresentation on an application, the applicant “was deemed unsuitable for\n\n\n\n       1 The decree also included reporting requirements regarding the racial composition of\napplicants, new hires, and employees who were demoted or fired.\n       2 That decision was affirmed on appeal.\n       3 Specifically, the District must interview at least the highest-scoring applicant; if it\n\ninterviews a lower-scoring applicant, it must also interview all other applicants who score\nhigher.\n                                               3\n\f     Case: 16-60722      Document: 00514338426        Page: 4    Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                     No. 16-60722\nemployment[,]” or (4) “the applicant was terminated or non-renewed for good\ncause from any previous employment position.”\n      The District could decline to offer the position to the highest-scoring\napplicant only “if a legitimate negative reason exists not to hire the applicant.”\nThe consent decree gave examples of such negative reasons: (1) negative\ncomments from references, (2) false information on an application, (3) failure\nto satisfy background check requirements, or (4) termination or non-renewal\nfrom a previous position. The decree further specified that “[t]he District may\nnot, however, fail to hire the highest overall-rated applicant only because it\nfavors a lower-rated applicant.” If the District wanted to hire a lower-scoring\napplicant, it had to notify the United States and the Intervenors, who had the\nopportunity to object. 4\n      In 2012, the district court granted the United States’ motion to enjoin\nthe District from violating the 2011 decree, on the grounds that the District\nhad hired several non-highest-scoring applicants without proper notice to the\nUnited States. In 2013, the District moved for unitary status with respect to\nfaculty and staff assignments. The United States did not object, but the\nIntervenors did, and the district court held a two-day hearing. The court\nreceived over five hundred objections from the community, but many of these\nwere generic and did not state details. At the hearing, some objectors who had\nbeen denied employment or promotion by the District testified. In April 2014,\nthe district court denied unitary status, citing use of modified interview guides\nand ranking forms without notice of the proposed change as an example of the\nDistrict’s non-compliance. The district court also extended the 2011 decree to\n\n\n\n\n      4 The United States and Intervenors could also object to hiring an applicant who did\nnot have the highest initial, pre-interview score.\n                                            4\n\f     Case: 16-60722        Document: 00514338426          Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-60722\nMarch 15, 2015. The Intervenors appealed that decision, challenging some of\nthe court’s factual findings. That appeal was dismissed for lack of standing. 5\n       In September 2015, the District yet again moved for unitary status. This\ntime there were approximately sixty-five objections, many of which were\nmerely generic. 6 The district court held another two-day hearing in 2016, and\ngranted the motion for unitary status, after considering the testimony from\nboth the 2014 and the 2016 hearings. The Intervenors now appeal.\n                                 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       This court reviews a finding that a school district is unitary for clear\nerror. 7 Under that standard, we will reverse only if we have a “definite and\nfirm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” 8 But a court reviewing for\nclear error may not reverse the district’s court finding if it is plausible in light\nof the entire record. 9 If the finding is plausible in light of the record, we may\nnot reverse even if, “had [we] been sitting as the trier of fact, [we] would have\nweighed the evidence differently.” 10 Neither will we “discount ‘the district\ncourt’s reasonable factual inferences from the evidence.’” 11\n        “The burden of showing that the findings of a district court are clearly\nerroneous is heavier if credibility of witnesses is a factor in the district court’s\ndetermination.” 12 “When findings are based on determinations regarding the\n\n\n\n       5 United States v.

The court also held\nthat the employment decisions did not demonstrate remnants of de jure\nsegregation.\nA. The District’s Good Faith Compliance With The Consent Decree\n      This court views the district court’s finding that a school district has\ncomplied with a desegregation order in good faith in light of the entire record. 16\nIn evaluating unitary status, “a court should give particular attention to the\nschool system’s record of compliance.” 17 The record of good faith compliance\nmust be “consistent[].” 18\n      The Intervenors presented hundreds of pages of evidence relating to\nmore than twenty employment-related decisions in the District over the past\nseveral years. The district court heard four days of testimony, at two different\nfairness hearings, from District officials and individuals who had applied for\nemployment or promotion in the District. The Intervenors urge that various\nemployment decisions show that the District failed to strictly follow the\nconsent decree in good faith; District officials provided explanations for the\nalleged defections from consent decree procedures.\n      We need not recount each of the Intervenors’ allegations here. The\ndistrict court’s finding that the District did not act in bad faith was based\nsignificantly on its assessment of the credibility of the District officials’\ntestimony explaining the employment decisions at issue. In each instance, the\ndistrict court credited this testimony of District officials over the evidence that\n\n\n\n\n      16 Anderson, 517 F.3d at 298.\n      17 Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n      18 Anderson, 517 F.3d at 297 (quoting Hull, 1 F.3d at 1454).\n\n                                            7\n\f     Case: 16-60722        Document: 00514338426           Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-60722\nthe Intervenors suggested showed bad faith. 19 We are not in a position to\nreassess the district court’s decisions to find some evidence credible and weigh\nit more heavily than other evidence. Only the district court is able to observe\nthe witnesses and “the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so\nheavily on the listener’s understanding of and belief in what is said.” 20 “[T]his\ncourt does not reweigh evidence and must defer to the trial court’s assessment\nof the credibility of witnesses.” 21 The fact that contradictory evidence might\nexist does not compel us to overturn the district court’s decision to credit other\nevidence instead. 22 The Intervenors have not shown “the very rarest of\ncircumstances” 23 that would allow us to revisit the district court’s weighing the\ncredibility of the evidence. 24\n       Even when the parties seem to agree on the facts, the Intervenors’\nremaining arguments do not demonstrate clear error. The Intervenors\ngenerally complain that the District violated the spirit of the consent decree—\nor, as counsel put it at oral argument, “manipulated” the consent decree—\ndemonstrating the District’s bad faith. But assessing the District’s motivations\nfor particular acts again required the district court to make factual\ndeterminations. We may only overturn these factual determinations if they are\nimplausible in light of the entire record. We here conclude that they are not.\n\n\n       19  The district court similarly credited the District’s documentary evidence, such as\nthe candidate summaries that it created in reviewing each candidate’s scores, interview\ncomments, and information gleaned from references.\n        20 Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575 (citing Wainwright, 469 U.S. 412 (1985)).\n        21 Perez v. Bruister, 823 F.3d 250, 269 (5th Cir. 2016).\n        22 See id.\n        23 Shami v. Comm’r, 741 F.3d 560, 565 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Durrett v. Comm’r, 71\n\nF.3d 515, 517 (5th Cir. 1996)).\n        24 For example, the district court resolved a factual dispute about whether Misty\n\nHannah interviewed her husband, Charles Hannah. The district court concluded that Misty\nwas “in attendance for the sole purpose of taking notes for the interviewers.” This conclusion\nis consistent with testimony from district officials, and is plausible in light of the record. For\nthis reason, we will not disturb the district court’s conclusion that this is not an example of\nthe District’s bad faith.\n                                                8\n\f     Case: 16-60722       Document: 00514338426          Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-60722\n       For example, the Intervenors cite a number of instances when the\nDistrict did not hire the highest-rated applicant. In those instances, the\nDistrict proffered a reason for failing to do so, which it contends is a “legitimate\nnegative reason” according to the consent decree. The Intervenors counter that\nthese proffered reasons are pretextual. But there is evidence supporting the\nconclusion that the District’s actions were consistent with the consent decree.\nThat indicates that the District’s motivations were genuine and not pretext. 25\nThese motivations are therefore plausible in light of the record.\n       Similarly, the Intervenors complain that the District took a number of\nactions that were not permitted by the consent decree, such as when the\nDistrict (1) relied on information about candidates that it received from outside\nof the formal interview process and (2) allowed individuals who recommended\napplicants to later interview those applicants. Such practices are not explicitly\npermitted by the consent decree, but neither are they prohibited by it. The\ndistrict court therefore had to determine whether the District’s practices\ndemonstrated bad faith. It concluded that they did not, and there is insufficient\ninformation in the record to upset that conclusion. For example, to prohibit\n\n\n       25At oral argument, the Intervenors’ counsel cited as an example the District’s failure\nto hire Katrina Smith. She had applied to be an instructional assistant, but she testified that\nshe told the District that she wanted the position because she had not passed the teacher-\nlicensing test. Smith had previously been a teacher in another school district, but had to stop\nwhen her license expired and she did not pass the test to renew it. Smith was the highest-\nscoring applicant, but in recommending a different candidate, the HR Director wrote “[Smith]\nhas a teaching position waiting for her[.]” This suggests that the District suspected that she\nwould return to her old teaching job once she passed the test. Smith testified that this was\nnot accurate, but also that she wanted the Simpson County job “because [she] did not pass”\nthe licensing test to continue in her prior job. The district court reasonably concluded that\nthe District relied on its suspicion—surely if Smith did intend to return to her old job, the\nDistrict would not expect her to say so explicitly. There is not sufficient information in the\nrecord to overturn the district court’s implicit determination that the District’s expectation\nthat Smith would leave the position if her old job as a teacher became available was a\nlegitimate reason not to hire her. Even if it were not, it is equally plausible from the record\nthat the District was confused about Smith’s intentions, rather than that it was acting in bad\nfaith.\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 16-60722     Document: 00514338426    Page: 10   Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-60722\nemployees who recommend an applicant from interviewing that applicant\nwould be infeasible. It is likely that many employees of a small school district\nwould know each other. In fact, there was testimony that in at least one case,\nreferences who interviewed a candidate were “part of the leadership team” for\nthe position being interviewed for. The Intervenors complain that an\ninterviewer who has given a favorable recommendation or reference taints the\n“objective” nature of the hiring process under the decree. But interviewing is\ninherently a subjective process. The consent decree does not purport to remove\nall subjectivity; it attempts to give quantitative values to what are still\nsubjective criteria.\n      In sum, the Intervenors have pointed to no practice or incident that was\nobjectively a violation of the consent decree. Instead, they have claimed to show\nexamples of the District’s bad faith. Perhaps some of these examples could be\ninterpreted to show bad faith on the District’s part, but the evidence in the\nrecord does not compel that conclusion. The evidence before the district court—\nincluding contemporaneous records made regarding each hiring decision—\nsupports the District’s explanations for all of its decisions. To assess whether\nthe District acted in bad faith, the district court was required to make factual\ndeterminations from the evidence, and the whole of the record shows that these\nfactual determinations were plausible. We therefore have no basis to find clear\nerror in these conclusions.\nB. Eliminating Vestiges Of De Jure Segregation\n      The district court held that the District has eliminated the vestiges of de\njure discrimination in employment, pointing to the strides that the District has\nmade since the inception of the consent decree: The number of African-\nAmerican teachers has increased or remained steady in the last decade, and\nthe District has endeavored to recruit at historically black colleges and\nuniversities. The Intervenors do not challenge these factual findings. Instead,\n                                       10\n\f    Case: 16-60722       Document: 00514338426         Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-60722\nthey contend that de jure segregation remains because the District continues\nto engage in “racially motivated” employment decisions, and “cronyistic” and\n“nepotistic” hiring—that is, considering only the favored candidates of those in\nauthority in the District.\n       Eliminating the vestiges of de jure segregation requires “ensur[ing] that\nthe principal wrong of the de jure [segregation] system, the injuries and stigma\ninflicted upon the race disfavored by the violation, is no longer present.” 26 But\n“a formerly segregated school system need not employ a faculty having a racial\ncomposition substantially equivalent to that of its student body [to effectively]\ndesegregate its schools and attain unitary status.” 27\n       As for the alleged racially motivated employment decisions, the\nIntervenors complain that a number of hiring decisions were racially\ndiscriminatory. 28 If the District did engage in discriminatory hiring, that would\nrequire reversal. But as explained above, the district court found that the\nvarious employment decisions did not violate the consent decree: Because all\nof those decisions were found to have been made in good faith, the court also\nfound that none were “motivated by race.” In other words, the district court\nconcluded that the District’s non-racial motivations for its actions were\ngenuine. As explained above, these findings were not clear error. Because we\ndo not reverse the district court’s holding that these decisions were in good\nfaith, did not conflict with the consent decree, and showed no pretext, we also\n\n\n\n\n       26 Freeman, 503 U.S. at 485.\n       27 Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist., 651 F.2d at 1138.\n       28 The District argues that many of the hiring officials who declined to hire African-\n\nAmericans were themselves African-Americans, so that decision cannot be discriminatory.\nBut as the Intervenors point out, what matters is whether the employee was treated\ndifferently because of race; the employer’s race is irrelevant.\n                                             11\n\f    Case: 16-60722        Document: 00514338426          Page: 12      Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-60722\nmust affirm the conclusion that none show the racially discriminatory hiring 29\nthat would perpetuate de jure segregation.\n       As for the alleged cronyism, the Intervenors cite to no case in which a\ncourt has addressed—much less held—that cronyism perpetuates the vestiges\nof de jure segregation. We may assume that if cronyism existed, it could\nentrench the vestiges of segregation. 30 It is true that many candidates who\nwere hired had some connection to those who made hiring decisions, but this\nis not surprising: The District is relatively small, and officials will obviously\nknow some candidates better than others. But again, the district court’s\ndetermination that none of the hiring decisions involved improper decision-\nmaking was plausible in light of the record. This compels the conclusion that\nnone of the hires were made because of cronyism. In other words, the district\ncourt found that the District’s hiring decisions all involved legitimate motives,\nand not cronyism. 31 Because these were factual determinations that are\nplausible in light of the record, we will not disturb them on appeal.\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n       As the district court noted in granting unitary status, its order is the\nfinal decision in a process that began over forty years ago. In fact, this appeal\nconcerns only employment, which was ultimately only one aspect of the racial\nsegregation that once existed within the Simpson County School District. The\ndistrict has been unitary in every other area—including in its most vital area,\n\n\n       29  Even if an individual example cited by the Intervenors was suspicious, many of the\ndecisions the Intervenors claim are discriminatory involve the District recommending a\nlower-ranking candidate of the same race as a higher-ranking candidate, and cannot be\nevidence of de jure racial discrimination.\n        30 Cf. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489 (“A remedy is justifiable only insofar as it advances\n\nthe ultimate objective of alleviating the initial constitutional violation.”).\n        31 Cronyism, by definition, requires favoring particular candidates “without regard to\n\ntheir qualifications.” Cronyism, AM. HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (5th\ned. 2011). It follows that if the District legitimately considers all candidates’ qualifications,\nthere is no cronyism.\n                                              12\n\f    Case: 16-60722          Document: 00514338426       Page: 13    Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                         No. 16-60722\neducating students—for more than ten years. As the district court noted, there\nis an entire agency devoted specifically to the kinds of employment disputes\nthat are at issue in this appeal.\n         Finally, in the words of the Eleventh Circuit:\n         This judgment means that appellants have accomplished what\n         they, decades ago, set out to do. They challenged a rigidly\n         maintained, de jure system of school segregation and sued to bring\n         it into compliance with the constitutional requirement of equal\n         protection under the law. We say today that they have succeeded.\n         If this judgment is counted as a loss for appellants, it is so because\n         they have won.\n         . . . The Board, and the people . . . who, in the end, govern their\n         school system, must be aware that the door through which they\n         leave the courthouse is not locked behind them. They will\n         undoubtedly find that this is so if they fail to maintain the unitary\n         system we conclude exists today. 32\nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n         32   NAACP, Jacksonville Branch v.

Students attending District schools (“the Intervenors”) intervened in\nthe litigation in 1982, contending that the District had not properly complied\nwith the consent decree. In 2015, the District moved for a finding of unitary\nstatus in the area of faculty and staff employment. The Intervenors objected,\nand after a hearing, the district court granted unitary status. The Intervenors\nnow appeal, and we affirm.\n                           I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n      In July 1970, the United States sued the State of Mississippi and several\nof its school districts, including the District, alleging that they operated school\nsystems that were segregated by race. In August 1970, the district court\nenjoined the District from discriminating based on race, and outlined various\nprocedures designed to end segregation in the District. The 1970 order\naddressed specific areas: faculty and staff assignments, student transfers,\ntransportation, school construction and site selection, and extracurricular\nactivities.\n      In 1982, the Intervenors filed a class action complaint against the\nDistrict for failing to comply with the 1970 order. In 1983, the district court\nentered another decree, outlining further procedures for the District. These\nincluded procedures aimed at employment practices, viz., requiring the\nDistrict to advertise available positions, use standard forms and objective\nrating criteria to review and score applications, and offer positions to the\nhighest-scoring applicant regardless of race. The 1983 decree also required\nthat the District notify the United States and Intervenors of any proposed\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f     Case: 16-60722       Document: 00514338426          Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-60722\nchange to employment procedures. 1 In 2001, the District moved for unitary\nstatus. The Intervenors did not respond, and the United States objected only\nin the area of faculty and staff assignments. The district court denied unitary\nstatus in that area, but granted unitary status in all other areas. 2\n       In 2011, the court entered another consent decree expanding on the\nrequired employment procedures. Specifically, the 2011 decree required that\n(1) the District advertise vacant positions for at least three weeks and post\nthem in specified locations, (2) the District maintain efforts to increase the\nnumber of qualified African-American applicants, (3) the District’s HR\nDirector score applicants using objective criteria and a standard scoring form,\n(4) the principal or superintendent interview the highest-scoring applicants, 3\n(5) the interviewers complete an interview form (attached to the decree) with\nnumerical scores for various criteria, and (6) the District offer the position to\nthe candidate with the highest combined pre- and post-interview scores.\n       The decree generally required the District to interview candidates with\nhigh initial scores. If the District declined to interview an applicant with a\nhigher score than another applicant selected for an interview, the principal or\nSuperintendent had to state in writing why he or she did not interview such\napplicant. The only reasons permitted by the decree for declining to interview\nsuch an applicant were: (1) the applicant declined the interview, (2) the District\ncould not contact the applicant after a prescribed number of attempts, (3) based\non information disclosed in a prior interview, reference check, background, or\nmisrepresentation on an application, the applicant “was deemed unsuitable for\n\n\n\n       1 The decree also included reporting requirements regarding the racial composition of\napplicants, new hires, and employees who were demoted or fired.\n       2 That decision was affirmed on appeal.\n       3 Specifically, the District must interview at least the highest-scoring applicant; if it\n\ninterviews a lower-scoring applicant, it must also interview all other applicants who score\nhigher.\n                                               3\n\f     Case: 16-60722      Document: 00514338426        Page: 4    Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                     No. 16-60722\nemployment[,]” or (4) “the applicant was terminated or non-renewed for good\ncause from any previous employment position.”\n      The District could decline to offer the position to the highest-scoring\napplicant only “if a legitimate negative reason exists not to hire the applicant.”\nThe consent decree gave examples of such negative reasons: (1) negative\ncomments from references, (2) false information on an application, (3) failure\nto satisfy background check requirements, or (4) termination or non-renewal\nfrom a previous position. The decree further specified that “[t]he District may\nnot, however, fail to hire the highest overall-rated applicant only because it\nfavors a lower-rated applicant.” If the District wanted to hire a lower-scoring\napplicant, it had to notify the United States and the Intervenors, who had the\nopportunity to object. 4\n      In 2012, the district court granted the United States’ motion to enjoin\nthe District from violating the 2011 decree, on the grounds that the District\nhad hired several non-highest-scoring applicants without proper notice to the\nUnited States. In 2013, the District moved for unitary status with respect to\nfaculty and staff assignments. The United States did not object, but the\nIntervenors did, and the district court held a two-day hearing. The court\nreceived over five hundred objections from the community, but many of these\nwere generic and did not state details. At the hearing, some objectors who had\nbeen denied employment or promotion by the District testified. In April 2014,\nthe district court denied unitary status, citing use of modified interview guides\nand ranking forms without notice of the proposed change as an example of the\nDistrict’s non-compliance. The district court also extended the 2011 decree to\n\n\n\n\n      4 The United States and Intervenors could also object to hiring an applicant who did\nnot have the highest initial, pre-interview score.\n                                            4\n\f     Case: 16-60722        Document: 00514338426          Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-60722\nMarch 15, 2015. The Intervenors appealed that decision, challenging some of\nthe court’s factual findings. That appeal was dismissed for lack of standing. 5\n       In September 2015, the District yet again moved for unitary status. This\ntime there were approximately sixty-five objections, many of which were\nmerely generic. 6 The district court held another two-day hearing in 2016, and\ngranted the motion for unitary status, after considering the testimony from\nboth the 2014 and the 2016 hearings. The Intervenors now appeal.\n                                 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       This court reviews a finding that a school district is unitary for clear\nerror. 7 Under that standard, we will reverse only if we have a “definite and\nfirm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” 8 But a court reviewing for\nclear error may not reverse the district’s court finding if it is plausible in light\nof the entire record. 9 If the finding is plausible in light of the record, we may\nnot reverse even if, “had [we] been sitting as the trier of fact, [we] would have\nweighed the evidence differently.” 10 Neither will we “discount ‘the district\ncourt’s reasonable factual inferences from the evidence.’” 11\n        “The burden of showing that the findings of a district court are clearly\nerroneous is heavier if credibility of witnesses is a factor in the district court’s\ndetermination.” 12 “When findings are based on determinations regarding the\n\n\n\n       5 United States v.

The court also held\nthat the employment decisions did not demonstrate remnants of de jure\nsegregation.\nA. The District’s Good Faith Compliance With The Consent Decree\n      This court views the district court’s finding that a school district has\ncomplied with a desegregation order in good faith in light of the entire record. 16\nIn evaluating unitary status, “a court should give particular attention to the\nschool system’s record of compliance.” 17 The record of good faith compliance\nmust be “consistent[].” 18\n      The Intervenors presented hundreds of pages of evidence relating to\nmore than twenty employment-related decisions in the District over the past\nseveral years. The district court heard four days of testimony, at two different\nfairness hearings, from District officials and individuals who had applied for\nemployment or promotion in the District. The Intervenors urge that various\nemployment decisions show that the District failed to strictly follow the\nconsent decree in good faith; District officials provided explanations for the\nalleged defections from consent decree procedures.\n      We need not recount each of the Intervenors’ allegations here. The\ndistrict court’s finding that the District did not act in bad faith was based\nsignificantly on its assessment of the credibility of the District officials’\ntestimony explaining the employment decisions at issue. In each instance, the\ndistrict court credited this testimony of District officials over the evidence that\n\n\n\n\n      16 Anderson, 517 F.3d at 298.\n      17 Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n      18 Anderson, 517 F.3d at 297 (quoting Hull, 1 F.3d at 1454).\n\n                                            7\n\f     Case: 16-60722        Document: 00514338426           Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-60722\nthe Intervenors suggested showed bad faith. 19 We are not in a position to\nreassess the district court’s decisions to find some evidence credible and weigh\nit more heavily than other evidence. Only the district court is able to observe\nthe witnesses and “the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so\nheavily on the listener’s understanding of and belief in what is said.” 20 “[T]his\ncourt does not reweigh evidence and must defer to the trial court’s assessment\nof the credibility of witnesses.” 21 The fact that contradictory evidence might\nexist does not compel us to overturn the district court’s decision to credit other\nevidence instead. 22 The Intervenors have not shown “the very rarest of\ncircumstances” 23 that would allow us to revisit the district court’s weighing the\ncredibility of the evidence. 24\n       Even when the parties seem to agree on the facts, the Intervenors’\nremaining arguments do not demonstrate clear error. The Intervenors\ngenerally complain that the District violated the spirit of the consent decree—\nor, as counsel put it at oral argument, “manipulated” the consent decree—\ndemonstrating the District’s bad faith. But assessing the District’s motivations\nfor particular acts again required the district court to make factual\ndeterminations. We may only overturn these factual determinations if they are\nimplausible in light of the entire record. We here conclude that they are not.\n\n\n       19  The district court similarly credited the District’s documentary evidence, such as\nthe candidate summaries that it created in reviewing each candidate’s scores, interview\ncomments, and information gleaned from references.\n        20 Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575 (citing Wainwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111303\"><a href=\"/opinion/111303/wainwright-v-witt/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985)).\n        21 Perez v.

The district court concluded that Misty\nwas “in attendance for the sole purpose of taking notes for the interviewers.” This conclusion\nis consistent with testimony from district officials, and is plausible in light of the record. For\nthis reason, we will not disturb the district court’s conclusion that this is not an example of\nthe District’s bad faith.\n                                                8\n\f     Case: 16-60722       Document: 00514338426          Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-60722\n       For example, the Intervenors cite a number of instances when the\nDistrict did not hire the highest-rated applicant. In those instances, the\nDistrict proffered a reason for failing to do so, which it contends is a “legitimate\nnegative reason” according to the consent decree. The Intervenors counter that\nthese proffered reasons are pretextual. But there is evidence supporting the\nconclusion that the District’s actions were consistent with the consent decree.\nThat indicates that the District’s motivations were genuine and not pretext. 25\nThese motivations are therefore plausible in light of the record.\n       Similarly, the Intervenors complain that the District took a number of\nactions that were not permitted by the consent decree, such as when the\nDistrict (1) relied on information about candidates that it received from outside\nof the formal interview process and (2) allowed individuals who recommended\napplicants to later interview those applicants. Such practices are not explicitly\npermitted by the consent decree, but neither are they prohibited by it. The\ndistrict court therefore had to determine whether the District’s practices\ndemonstrated bad faith. It concluded that they did not, and there is insufficient\ninformation in the record to upset that conclusion. For example, to prohibit\n\n\n       25At oral argument, the Intervenors’ counsel cited as an example the District’s failure\nto hire Katrina Smith. She had applied to be an instructional assistant, but she testified that\nshe told the District that she wanted the position because she had not passed the teacher-\nlicensing test. Smith had previously been a teacher in another school district, but had to stop\nwhen her license expired and she did not pass the test to renew it. Smith was the highest-\nscoring applicant, but in recommending a different candidate, the HR Director wrote “[Smith]\nhas a teaching position waiting for her[.]” This suggests that the District suspected that she\nwould return to her old teaching job once she passed the test. Smith testified that this was\nnot accurate, but also that she wanted the Simpson County job “because [she] did not pass”\nthe licensing test to continue in her prior job. The district court reasonably concluded that\nthe District relied on its suspicion—surely if Smith did intend to return to her old job, the\nDistrict would not expect her to say so explicitly. There is not sufficient information in the\nrecord to overturn the district court’s implicit determination that the District’s expectation\nthat Smith would leave the position if her old job as a teacher became available was a\nlegitimate reason not to hire her. Even if it were not, it is equally plausible from the record\nthat the District was confused about Smith’s intentions, rather than that it was acting in bad\nfaith.\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 16-60722     Document: 00514338426    Page: 10   Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-60722\nemployees who recommend an applicant from interviewing that applicant\nwould be infeasible. It is likely that many employees of a small school district\nwould know each other. In fact, there was testimony that in at least one case,\nreferences who interviewed a candidate were “part of the leadership team” for\nthe position being interviewed for. The Intervenors complain that an\ninterviewer who has given a favorable recommendation or reference taints the\n“objective” nature of the hiring process under the decree. But interviewing is\ninherently a subjective process. The consent decree does not purport to remove\nall subjectivity; it attempts to give quantitative values to what are still\nsubjective criteria.\n      In sum, the Intervenors have pointed to no practice or incident that was\nobjectively a violation of the consent decree. Instead, they have claimed to show\nexamples of the District’s bad faith. Perhaps some of these examples could be\ninterpreted to show bad faith on the District’s part, but the evidence in the\nrecord does not compel that conclusion. The evidence before the district court—\nincluding contemporaneous records made regarding each hiring decision—\nsupports the District’s explanations for all of its decisions. To assess whether\nthe District acted in bad faith, the district court was required to make factual\ndeterminations from the evidence, and the whole of the record shows that these\nfactual determinations were plausible. We therefore have no basis to find clear\nerror in these conclusions.\nB. Eliminating Vestiges Of De Jure Segregation\n      The district court held that the District has eliminated the vestiges of de\njure discrimination in employment, pointing to the strides that the District has\nmade since the inception of the consent decree: The number of African-\nAmerican teachers has increased or remained steady in the last decade, and\nthe District has endeavored to recruit at historically black colleges and\nuniversities. The Intervenors do not challenge these factual findings. Instead,\n                                       10\n\f    Case: 16-60722       Document: 00514338426         Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-60722\nthey contend that de jure segregation remains because the District continues\nto engage in “racially motivated” employment decisions, and “cronyistic” and\n“nepotistic” hiring—that is, considering only the favored candidates of those in\nauthority in the District.\n       Eliminating the vestiges of de jure segregation requires “ensur[ing] that\nthe principal wrong of the de jure [segregation] system, the injuries and stigma\ninflicted upon the race disfavored by the violation, is no longer present.” 26 But\n“a formerly segregated school system need not employ a faculty having a racial\ncomposition substantially equivalent to that of its student body [to effectively]\ndesegregate its schools and attain unitary status.” 27\n       As for the alleged racially motivated employment decisions, the\nIntervenors complain that a number of hiring decisions were racially\ndiscriminatory. 28 If the District did engage in discriminatory hiring, that would\nrequire reversal. But as explained above, the district court found that the\nvarious employment decisions did not violate the consent decree: Because all\nof those decisions were found to have been made in good faith, the court also\nfound that none were “motivated by race.” In other words, the district court\nconcluded that the District’s non-racial motivations for its actions were\ngenuine. As explained above, these findings were not clear error. Because we\ndo not reverse the district court’s holding that these decisions were in good\nfaith, did not conflict with the consent decree, and showed no pretext, we also\n\n\n\n\n       26 Freeman, 503 U.S. at 485.\n       27 Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist., 651 F.2d at 1138.\n       28 The District argues that many of the hiring officials who declined to hire African-\n\nAmericans were themselves African-Americans, so that decision cannot be discriminatory.\nBut as the Intervenors point out, what matters is whether the employee was treated\ndifferently because of race; the employer’s race is irrelevant.\n                                             11\n\f    Case: 16-60722        Document: 00514338426          Page: 12      Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-60722\nmust affirm the conclusion that none show the racially discriminatory hiring 29\nthat would perpetuate de jure segregation.\n       As for the alleged cronyism, the Intervenors cite to no case in which a\ncourt has addressed—much less held—that cronyism perpetuates the vestiges\nof de jure segregation. We may assume that if cronyism existed, it could\nentrench the vestiges of segregation. 30 It is true that many candidates who\nwere hired had some connection to those who made hiring decisions, but this\nis not surprising: The District is relatively small, and officials will obviously\nknow some candidates better than others. But again, the district court’s\ndetermination that none of the hiring decisions involved improper decision-\nmaking was plausible in light of the record. This compels the conclusion that\nnone of the hires were made because of cronyism. In other words, the district\ncourt found that the District’s hiring decisions all involved legitimate motives,\nand not cronyism. 31 Because these were factual determinations that are\nplausible in light of the record, we will not disturb them on appeal.\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n       As the district court noted in granting unitary status, its order is the\nfinal decision in a process that began over forty years ago. In fact, this appeal\nconcerns only employment, which was ultimately only one aspect of the racial\nsegregation that once existed within the Simpson County School District. The\ndistrict has been unitary in every other area—including in its most vital area,\n\n\n       29  Even if an individual example cited by the Intervenors was suspicious, many of the\ndecisions the Intervenors claim are discriminatory involve the District recommending a\nlower-ranking candidate of the same race as a higher-ranking candidate, and cannot be\nevidence of de jure racial discrimination.\n        30 Cf. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489 (“A remedy is justifiable only insofar as it advances\n\nthe ultimate objective of alleviating the initial constitutional violation.”).\n        31 Cronyism, by definition, requires favoring particular candidates “without regard to\n\ntheir qualifications.” Cronyism, AM. HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (5th\ned. 2011). It follows that if the District legitimately considers all candidates’ qualifications,\nthere is no cronyism.\n                                              12\n\f    Case: 16-60722          Document: 00514338426       Page: 13    Date Filed: 02/06/2018\n\n\n\n                                         No. 16-60722\neducating students—for more than ten years. As the district court noted, there\nis an entire agency devoted specifically to the kinds of employment disputes\nthat are at issue in this appeal.\n         Finally, in the words of the Eleventh Circuit:\n         This judgment means that appellants have accomplished what\n         they, decades ago, set out to do. They challenged a rigidly\n         maintained, de jure system of school segregation and sued to bring\n         it into compliance with the constitutional requirement of equal\n         protection under the law. We say today that they have succeeded.\n         If this judgment is counted as a loss for appellants, it is so because\n         they have won.\n         . . . The Board, and the people . . . who, in the end, govern their\n         school system, must be aware that the door through which they\n         leave the courthouse is not locked behind them. They will\n         undoubtedly find that this is so if they fail to maintain the unitary\n         system we conclude exists today. 32\nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n         32   NAACP, Jacksonville Branch v.
