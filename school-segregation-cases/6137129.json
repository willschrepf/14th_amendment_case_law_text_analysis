The Commissioner's January 10,\n\n\n                                      3                              A-2768-12T3\n\f2013 decision adopted the initial decision of an administrative\n\nlaw judge (ALJ) dismissing as moot petitions filed against the\n\nToms River Board of Education and its former superintendent,\n\nMichael Ritacco.      The Commissioner's November 4, 2013 decision\n\nadopted an initial decision denying petitioners' motions to amend\n\ntheir petitions, because the amendments sought to add a party over\n\nwhich the Commissioner had no jurisdiction and sought relief that\n\nwas beyond the Commissioner's jurisdiction to provide.              Agreeing\n\nwith the ALJ, the Commissioner concluded that the new claims,\n\nwhich petitioners sought to assert, should be adjudicated in\n\nSuperior Court or elsewhere, and not before the Commissioner.             For\n\nthe reasons that follow, we affirm the January 10, 2013 and\n\nNovember 4, 2013 final decisions.\n\n     The    history   of   the   underlying   dispute   was    exhaustively\n\ndetailed in this court's prior opinion in Borough of Seaside Park\n\nv. Commissioner of New Jersey Department of Education, 432 N.J.\n\nSuper. 167, 177-90 (App. Div.), certif. denied, 216 N.J. 367\n\n(2013), and in the ALJ's and Commissioner's decisions in this\n\ncase.    The Central Regional school district consists of five Ocean\n\nCounty     municipalities,   including    Seaside   Park      and   Berkeley\n\nTownship.     For approximately a decade, Seaside Park, which is\n\nsmaller and more affluent than most of the other municipalities\n\nin the district, has been trying to either withdraw from the\n\n                                     4                               A-2768-12T3\n\fregional district or obtain a modification of the formula by which\n\nit contributes to the district's costs.\n\n     In 2009, some of the parents in Seaside Park began sending\n\ntheir children to school in nearby Toms River, rather than sending\n\nthem to the Central Regional district schools.            Initially, by\n\nagreement with the Seaside Park Board of Education, Toms River\n\nallowed the children to attend its schools without paying out-of-\n\ndistrict tuition.    However, after petitioners complained to the\n\nCommissioner, Toms River began charging tuition.           According to\n\npetitioners, a local citizens group known as Citizens Aligned for\n\nResponsible and Equitable Schools (C.A.R.E.S.) actually paid the\n\nstudents' tuition.     Petitioners contend that C.A.R.E.S. obtained\n\nthe tuition funding through an illegal scheme in which Seaside\n\nPark awarded C.A.R.E.S. a no-bid municipal contract for work the\n\ngroup did not actually perform.\n\n     The Seaside Park opinion addressed the right of individual\n\nSeaside Park parents to send their children to out-of-district\n\nschools.   \"They [the parents] are not required to send their\n\nchildren to Central Regional.        They can send their children to\n\nother schools at their own expense, relocate to another school\n\ndistrict, or even home-school their children.\"        Id. at 222.\n\n     The   pertinent     education       statute,   N.J.S.A.   18A:38-3,\n\nauthorizes any school district to permit out-of-district students\n\n                                     5                           A-2768-12T3\n\fto attend its school system, with or without paying tuition.\n\nPutting aside whether Toms River could lawfully permit Seaside\n\nPark students to attend without paying tuition in the circumstances\n\nof this case, the dispute over the \"free tuition\" policy was\n\nrendered moot in 2011, when Toms River instituted a policy of\n\nrequiring tuition payments. See Greenfield v. N.J. Dep't of Corr.,\n\n382 N.J. Super. 254, 257-58 (App. Div. 2006) (addressing the\n\nmootness doctrine).   Accordingly, substantially for the reasons\n\nstated by the ALJ and adopted by the Commissioner, we affirm the\n\nJanuary 10, 2013 decision dismissing the original petitions as\n\nmoot.\n\n     Considering the record in light of the applicable standard\n\nof review, we likewise find no basis to disturb the Commissioner's\n\ndecision denying the motions to file amended petitions.    See Bd.\n\nof Educ. of Bor. of Englewood Cliffs v. Bd. of Educ. of the City\n\nof Engelwood, 257 N.J. Super. 413, 455-56 (App. Div. 1992), aff'd\n\no.b., 132 N.J. 327 (1993).   The new claims petitioners sought to\n\nassert raised legal issues that were beyond the Commissioner's\n\njurisdiction.   As we have previously recognized, although the\n\nCommissioner has plenary jurisdiction to determine controversies\n\narising under the school laws, N.J.S.A. 18A:6-9, that does not\n\nmean the Commissioner has jurisdiction over every conceivable\n\ncontroversy that concerns a board of education.        See Archway\n\n                                 6                          A-2768-12T3\n\fPrograms, Inc. v. Pemberton Twp. Bd. of Educ., 352 N.J. Super.\n\n420, 424-26 (App. Div. 2002).         In Archway, for example, we held\n\nthat a breach of contract claim against a board of education did\n\nnot fall within the Commissioner's jurisdiction, but instead was\n\nproperly filed in the Law Division.          Id. at 431.      However, to the\n\nextent that the contract claim implicated legal issues within the\n\nCommissioner's jurisdiction, the court might, under the doctrine\n\nof   primary      jurisdiction,   refer    that    discrete     issue   to   the\n\nCommissioner for resolution.        Id.    at 425.\n\n      In   this    case,   petitioners    allege   that   the    Seaside     Park\n\nmunicipal government, and the Seaside Park Board of Education\n\n(BOE), conspired with C.A.R.E.S. to illegally provide public funds\n\nwith which to pay local students' tuition to attend the Toms River\n\nschools.    According to petitioners, the conspiracy involved the\n\nawarding of an allegedly illegal no-bid contract to C.A.R.E.S.,\n\nfor work that the organization itself did not actually perform.\n\nPetitioners also alleged that one or more members of the municipal\n\ngoverning body or the BOE had conflicts of interest in approving\n\nor facilitating the contract, and that C.A.R.E.S. was not operating\n\nas a legitimate charitable organization.\n\n      We agree with the Seaside Park respondents that, so long as\n\nthe Toms River Board of Education permits it, Seaside Park parents\n\ncan lawfully pay tuition and send their children to the Toms River\n\n                                     7                                  A-2768-12T3\n\fschools.2     See Seaside Park, supra, 432 N.J. Super. at 222;\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:38-3.         The parents can raise the tuition by holding\n\nbake sales, soliciting private donations, or by any other lawful\n\nmeans.      However, the crux of petitioners' claims is that the\n\ntuition money was obtained by unlawful means, and that the alleged\n\nunlawful funding conspiracy should cease.                   Their proposed amended\n\npetitions asserted that the various named respondents (including\n\nC.A.R.E.S.) committed fraud and money laundering, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-\n\n25, as well as violations of the Local Public Contracts Law, local\n\ngovernment        ethics    laws,     and       statutes    governing     non-profit\n\ncorporations.        None of those causes of action arose under the\n\nschool laws.        We agree with the Commissioner that such claims,\n\nagainst     the    municipal    defendants         and     C.A.R.E.S.,    should     be\n\nasserted     in     the    Superior    Court.            See,   e.g.,    R.   4:69-1.\n\nAdditionally or alternatively, some of the claims may fall within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Local Finance Board, see N.J.S.A. 40A:9-\n\n22.4, or the county prosecutor.3\n\n\n2\n   We do not mean to imply that Toms River must charge tuition;\nthat issue is moot and we do not address it. Nor do we address a\nsituation, not present here, where a sending and receiving\nagreement, or a private-tuition arrangement, will increase racial\nsegregation in the public schools. See Englewood Cliffs, supra,\n257 N.J. Super. at 450-51, 473-74.\n3\n  For the sake of completeness, we note that, if petitioners prove\ntheir underlying claims in the trial court, but some aspect of the\n\n\n                                            8                                 A-2768-12T3\n\f     Petitioners' remaining arguments are without sufficient merit\n\nto warrant discussion, beyond the following brief comments.                     See\n\nR. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n\n     The parties engaged in discovery for over a year.                    We find\n\nno abuse of discretion on the part of the ALJ or the Commissioner\n\nin not delaying the decisions here to permit more discovery.                    See\n\nPomerantz Paper Corp. v. New Cmty. Corp., 207 N.J. 344, 371 (2011).\n\nFurther,    additional     discovery        would    not    have   affected     the\n\njurisdictional decision or the mootness issue.\n\n     Contrary to petitioners' arguments, the Commissioner did not\n\nimplicitly or explicitly approve either a de-regionalization plan\n\nor the withdrawal of Seaside Park from the Central Regional school\n\ndistrict.     The fact that a handful of parents in a tiny school\n\ndistrict chose to send their children to a school in another\n\ndistrict, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:38-3, did not constitute de-\n\nregionalization     or    withdrawal        from    the    district.      As    the\n\nCommissioner    noted,    given   the   few        students   involved    and   the\n\ntermination    of   the   \"free   tuition\"         arrangement,    he   would   not\n\n\"exercise the extraordinary remedy of injunction to preclude Toms\n\n\n\nrelief they seek concerns a remedy that is within the\nCommissioner's exclusive jurisdiction to provide, the court could\nrefer that discrete issue to the Commissioner under the doctrine\nof primary jurisdiction. See Archway, supra, 352 N.J. Super. at\n425.\n\n                                        9                                 A-2768-12T3\n\fRiver   from   allowing   individual   Seaside   Park   students   from\n\nattending its schools on a tuition-payment basis.\"\n\n     As previously addressed above, to the extent petitioners\n\ncontend that an unlawful scheme is being used to raise the tuition\n\nmoney, that claim belongs in a forum other than the Department of\n\nEducation.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 10                            A-2768-12T3\n\f",

The Commissioner's January 10,\n\n\n                                      3                              A-2768-12T3\n\f2013 decision adopted the initial decision of an administrative\n\nlaw judge (ALJ) dismissing as moot petitions filed against the\n\nToms River Board of Education and its former superintendent,\n\nMichael Ritacco.      The Commissioner's November 4, 2013 decision\n\nadopted an initial decision denying petitioners' motions to amend\n\ntheir petitions, because the amendments sought to add a party over\n\nwhich the Commissioner had no jurisdiction and sought relief that\n\nwas beyond the Commissioner's jurisdiction to provide.              Agreeing\n\nwith the ALJ, the Commissioner concluded that the new claims,\n\nwhich petitioners sought to assert, should be adjudicated in\n\nSuperior Court or elsewhere, and not before the Commissioner.             For\n\nthe reasons that follow, we affirm the January 10, 2013 and\n\nNovember 4, 2013 final decisions.\n\n     The    history   of   the   underlying   dispute   was    exhaustively\n\ndetailed in this court's prior opinion in Borough of Seaside Park\n\nv. Commissioner of New Jersey Department of Education, 432 N.J.\n\nSuper. 167, 177-90 (App. Div.), certif. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2013), and in the ALJ's and Commissioner's decisions in this\n\ncase.    The Central Regional school district consists of five Ocean\n\nCounty     municipalities,   including    Seaside   Park      and   Berkeley\n\nTownship.     For approximately a decade, Seaside Park, which is\n\nsmaller and more affluent than most of the other municipalities\n\nin the district, has been trying to either withdraw from the\n\n                                     4                               A-2768-12T3\n\fregional district or obtain a modification of the formula by which\n\nit contributes to the district's costs.\n\n     In 2009, some of the parents in Seaside Park began sending\n\ntheir children to school in nearby Toms River, rather than sending\n\nthem to the Central Regional district schools.            Initially, by\n\nagreement with the Seaside Park Board of Education, Toms River\n\nallowed the children to attend its schools without paying out-of-\n\ndistrict tuition.    However, after petitioners complained to the\n\nCommissioner, Toms River began charging tuition.           According to\n\npetitioners, a local citizens group known as Citizens Aligned for\n\nResponsible and Equitable Schools (C.A.R.E.S.) actually paid the\n\nstudents' tuition.     Petitioners contend that C.A.R.E.S. obtained\n\nthe tuition funding through an illegal scheme in which Seaside\n\nPark awarded C.A.R.E.S. a no-bid municipal contract for work the\n\ngroup did not actually perform.\n\n     The Seaside Park opinion addressed the right of individual\n\nSeaside Park parents to send their children to out-of-district\n\nschools.   \"They [the parents] are not required to send their\n\nchildren to Central Regional.        They can send their children to\n\nother schools at their own expense, relocate to another school\n\ndistrict, or even home-school their children.\"        Id. at 222.\n\n     The   pertinent     education       statute,   N.J.S.A.   18A:38-3,\n\nauthorizes any school district to permit out-of-district students\n\n                                     5                           A-2768-12T3\n\fto attend its school system, with or without paying tuition.\n\nPutting aside whether Toms River could lawfully permit Seaside\n\nPark students to attend without paying tuition in the circumstances\n\nof this case, the dispute over the \"free tuition\" policy was\n\nrendered moot in 2011, when Toms River instituted a policy of\n\nrequiring tuition payments.

Accordingly, substantially for the reasons\n\nstated by the ALJ and adopted by the Commissioner, we affirm the\n\nJanuary 10, 2013 decision dismissing the original petitions as\n\nmoot.\n\n     Considering the record in light of the applicable standard\n\nof review, we likewise find no basis to disturb the Commissioner's\n\ndecision denying the motions to file amended petitions.

The new claims petitioners sought to\n\nassert raised legal issues that were beyond the Commissioner's\n\njurisdiction.   As we have previously recognized, although the\n\nCommissioner has plenary jurisdiction to determine controversies\n\narising under the school laws, N.J.S.A. 18A:6-9, that does not\n\nmean the Commissioner has jurisdiction over every conceivable\n\ncontroversy that concerns a board of education.        See Archway\n\n                                 6                          A-2768-12T3\n\fPrograms, Inc. v. Pemberton Twp.

In Archway, for example, we held\n\nthat a breach of contract claim against a board of education did\n\nnot fall within the Commissioner's jurisdiction, but instead was\n\nproperly filed in the Law Division.          Id. at 431.      However, to the\n\nextent that the contract claim implicated legal issues within the\n\nCommissioner's jurisdiction, the court might, under the doctrine\n\nof   primary      jurisdiction,   refer    that    discrete     issue   to   the\n\nCommissioner for resolution.        Id.    at 425.\n\n      In   this    case,   petitioners    allege   that   the    Seaside     Park\n\nmunicipal government, and the Seaside Park Board of Education\n\n(BOE), conspired with C.A.R.E.S. to illegally provide public funds\n\nwith which to pay local students' tuition to attend the Toms River\n\nschools.    According to petitioners, the conspiracy involved the\n\nawarding of an allegedly illegal no-bid contract to C.A.R.E.S.,\n\nfor work that the organization itself did not actually perform.\n\nPetitioners also alleged that one or more members of the municipal\n\ngoverning body or the BOE had conflicts of interest in approving\n\nor facilitating the contract, and that C.A.R.E.S. was not operating\n\nas a legitimate charitable organization.\n\n      We agree with the Seaside Park respondents that, so long as\n\nthe Toms River Board of Education permits it, Seaside Park parents\n\ncan lawfully pay tuition and send their children to the Toms River\n\n                                     7                                  A-2768-12T3\n\fschools.2     See Seaside Park, supra, 432 N.J. Super. at 222;\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:38-3.         The parents can raise the tuition by holding\n\nbake sales, soliciting private donations, or by any other lawful\n\nmeans.      However, the crux of petitioners' claims is that the\n\ntuition money was obtained by unlawful means, and that the alleged\n\nunlawful funding conspiracy should cease.                   Their proposed amended\n\npetitions asserted that the various named respondents (including\n\nC.A.R.E.S.) committed fraud and money laundering, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-\n\n25, as well as violations of the Local Public Contracts Law, local\n\ngovernment        ethics    laws,     and       statutes    governing     non-profit\n\ncorporations.        None of those causes of action arose under the\n\nschool laws.        We agree with the Commissioner that such claims,\n\nagainst     the    municipal    defendants         and     C.A.R.E.S.,    should     be\n\nasserted     in     the    Superior    Court.            See,   e.g.,    R.   4:69-1.\n\nAdditionally or alternatively, some of the claims may fall within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Local Finance Board, see N.J.S.A. 40A:9-\n\n22.4, or the county prosecutor.3\n\n\n2\n   We do not mean to imply that Toms River must charge tuition;\nthat issue is moot and we do not address it. Nor do we address a\nsituation, not present here, where a sending and receiving\nagreement, or a private-tuition arrangement, will increase racial\nsegregation in the public schools. See Englewood Cliffs, supra,\n257 N.J. Super. at 450-51, 473-74.\n3\n  For the sake of completeness, we note that, if petitioners prove\ntheir underlying claims in the trial court, but some aspect of the\n\n\n                                            8                                 A-2768-12T3\n\f     Petitioners' remaining arguments are without sufficient merit\n\nto warrant discussion, beyond the following brief comments.                     See\n\nR. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n\n     The parties engaged in discovery for over a year.                    We find\n\nno abuse of discretion on the part of the ALJ or the Commissioner\n\nin not delaying the decisions here to permit more discovery.                    See\n\nPomerantz Paper Corp. v. New Cmty. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2326624\"><a href=\"/opinion/2326624/pomerantz-paper-v-new-comm-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (2011).\n\nFurther,    additional     discovery        would    not    have   affected     the\n\njurisdictional decision or the mootness issue.\n\n     Contrary to petitioners' arguments, the Commissioner did not\n\nimplicitly or explicitly approve either a de-regionalization plan\n\nor the withdrawal of Seaside Park from the Central Regional school\n\ndistrict.     The fact that a handful of parents in a tiny school\n\ndistrict chose to send their children to a school in another\n\ndistrict, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:38-3, did not constitute de-\n\nregionalization     or    withdrawal        from    the    district.      As    the\n\nCommissioner    noted,    given   the   few        students   involved    and   the\n\ntermination    of   the   \"free   tuition\"         arrangement,    he   would   not\n\n\"exercise the extraordinary remedy of injunction to preclude Toms\n\n\n\nrelief they seek concerns a remedy that is within the\nCommissioner's exclusive jurisdiction to provide, the court could\nrefer that discrete issue to the Commissioner under the doctrine\nof primary jurisdiction. See Archway, supra, 352 N.J. Super. at\n425.\n\n                                        9                                 A-2768-12T3\n\fRiver   from   allowing   individual   Seaside   Park   students   from\n\nattending its schools on a tuition-payment basis.\"\n\n     As previously addressed above, to the extent petitioners\n\ncontend that an unlawful scheme is being used to raise the tuition\n\nmoney, that claim belongs in a forum other than the Department of\n\nEducation.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 10                            A-2768-12T3\n\f</pre>",
