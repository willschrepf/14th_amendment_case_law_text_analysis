Ct. No. J0900801)\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n        Edward C. was declared a ward of the juvenile court under Welfare and\nInstitutions Code section 6021 after he admitted two counts of continuous sexual abuse of\na child under Penal Code section 288.5. He appeals from an order committing him to the\nDivision of Juvenile Facilities (DJF) after he violated probation and a supplemental\npetition was found true. Appellant argues the commitment amounts to an ex post facto\nlaw because DJF was not an authorized placement for his offenses at the time of their\ncommission. (See U.S. Const., art. I, § 10; Cal. Const., art. I, § 9.) He further argues a\nDJF commitment was an abuse of discretion in light of the less restrictive alternatives\navailable. We reject both claims and, in light of the valid DJF commitment, strike the\nprobation conditions imposed by the juvenile court.\n\n\n\n\n    1 Further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n                                             1\n\f                                      BACKGROUND\n         In 2009, when he was 14 years old, appellant was discovered touching his 10-\nyear-old half brother inappropriately. The half brother revealed appellant had been\nengaging in sexual activity with him and with his 8-year-old sister (appellant’s half sister)\nduring the previous two years. The acts occurred several times a week, and included oral\ncopulation and attempted anal and vaginal intercourse.\n         A petition was filed under section 602 charging appellant with multiple sexual\noffenses. He was declared a ward of the juvenile court after admitting two counts of\ncontinuous sexual abuse of a child under Penal Code section 288.5, between January 10,\n2008 and May 7, 2009, in exchange for a dismissal of the other charges. Appellant was\ngranted probation and placed in the residential juvenile sex offenders treatment program\nat Martins’ Achievement Place (MAP), where he remained for the next two and one-half\nyears.\n         Appellant’s progress at MAP was uneven. He had a profound speech problem\nmaking it difficult for others to understand him, was believed to be dyslexic, and\npotentially fell on the autism spectrum. In a probation report filed in September 2010, his\nbehavior was noted to be improving, but a few months later he admitted a probation\nviolation after having consensual sex with his roommate and another resident. He was\nseen by staff as “struggling” in treatment: minimizing his offenses, falling into a “victim\nrole” when confronted, and avoiding the emotions necessary to develop empathy.\n         In a report dated May 6, 2011, the probation officer stated appellant was “fully\nengaged in treatment and has made a significant amount of progress” since being moved\nto a different house at MAP. On February 14, 2012, however, appellant admitted he had\nviolated probation because he was not progressing in his program and had failed to\ncomplete several of his sex offender treatment assignments. He remained in his\nplacement at MAP and his attitude improved after he began taking prescription\nantidepressant medication. But problems continued as he persisted in sexualized and\naggressive behavior, showing little insight into his issues.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        On April 27, 2012, the probation officer filed a notice alleging appellant had\nviolated probation by failing to follow the rules and regulations at MAP. The\naccompanying report noted that appellant was having difficulties completing his\ntreatment-related assignments and described an incident in which he had been discovered\nin his room with his pants pulled down below his buttocks in the presence of two\nroommates. The probation officer recommended a change in placement, as appellant had\nbeen at MAP for two and one-half years and made “little to no progress.” The probation\nviolation was dismissed contingent on appellant’s placement in a different treatment\nprogram.\n        Appellant was placed in the Breaking the Cycle (BTC) program in May 2012, but\nhad difficulty following the rules and received several incident reports based on his\ninappropriate behavior with respect to boundaries, his “grooming” of other residents and\nstaff with sexualized behavior, and his writing in a journal that was sexual in content and\nincluded graphics illustrating a penis. A quarterly report on his progress indicated\nappellant showed little ability or willingness to curtail his inappropriate conduct and did\nnot appear to understand the severity of his situation, focusing more on perceived\nviolations of his own rights.\n        Appellant turned 18 in November 2012. On November 7, the probation officer\nfiled a notice alleging appellant had violated probation by failing to obey the staff at his\ncourt-ordered placement and by failing to fully participate in his sex offender treatment\nprogram. On that same date, the district attorney filed a supplemental petition under\nsections 602 and 778 seeking continuing jurisdiction over appellant and a modification of\nhis placement, as he would not be permitted to remain in the BTC program past his 18th\nbirthday. (See § 607, subd. (a) [juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over ward until age\n21].)\n        The court held a combined hearing on the probation violation and supplemental\npetition on December 11, 2012. Rebecca Baker, the director of BTC, testified there were\nthree phases to their program, which were expected to take six months to complete, but\nappellant had not finished Phase 1 during his time there. He had failed to complete\n\n                                              3\n\fassignments or engage meaningfully in individual therapy, had repeatedly violated the\nrules, and had shown a “poor” level of participation in group therapy. The court found by\nclear and convincing evidence that appellant had violated probation and sustained the\nsupplemental petition.\n       The court ordered appellant screened for different prospective placements.\nBecause appellant was 18 years old with a high school diploma, he was ineligible for\nplacement in any local residential program, the only options being the inpatient sex\noffender treatment available at DJF or an outpatient program. At the contested\ndispositional hearing, the district attorney urged the court to commit appellant to DJF.\nDefense counsel argued a commitment to DJF would constitute an ex post facto law,\nbecause that disposition was not available when appellant committed his offenses. The\nprobation officer recommended that appellant be released to live with his aunt and treated\nas an outpatient.\n       Krys Hunter, DJF’s acting senior supervising clinical psychologist, testified about\nthe DJF sex offender treatment program available at two facilities, each having four units\ncomprised of a maximum of 36 youths, staffed by two clinicians, a senior counselor,\nseveral youth counselors, two casework specialists or parole agents, and a treatment team\nspecialist. The curriculum, which was recently revised to take into account research on\njuvenile sex offenders in particular, consists of seven stages and is designed to be\ncompleted in 18 to 24 months, including an eight- to ten-week orientation period focusing\non healthy living. The youths in the program are assessed and segregated based on their\nrisk of reoffense, and if they finish early are able to become mentors or take vocational\ntraining. The treatment includes components of group and individual therapy, resource\ngroups designed to address other issues such as substance abuse or anger management,\njournals, role-playing assignments, the discussion of various books, and family therapy.\nAccording to Hunter, the program was integrated into every aspect of the youth’s life at\nDJF and was designed to prevent future criminality in general, not merely the sex\noffenses that led to the commitment. Family members were encouraged to participate in\n\n\n                                             4\n\ffamily therapy to keep them in touch with the youth and to help prepare the youth for\neventual release.\n       Arthur Paull, the director of A Step Forward, a juvenile sex offender outpatient\ntreatment program, had screened appellant for the program and found him to be at\nmoderate risk of reoffending. At the dispositional hearing, he testified appellant would\nreceive one or two hours a week of individual therapy if admitted to A Step Forward,\nalong with monthly family therapy and quarterly case conferences as needed. If appellant\nwere to participate in that program while residing with his aunt, as the probation\ndepartment had recommended, the staff at A Step Forward would have to rely on honest,\ncomplete reporting from her to know whether appellant was at risk of reoffending. Paull\ndid not think a DJF commitment would be productive because appellant had not done\nwell in other residential programs; and, accordingly, he recommended an outpatient plan\nwith a suspended DJF commitment rather than a straight commitment to DJF. He\nbelieved appellant would benefit from a structured outpatient program with good\nsupervision, but had appellant not turned 18, he would have recommended a return to the\nMAP residential program. Paull believed appellant should get the maximum amount of\nresidential treatment available before participating in A Step Forward.\n       The court committed appellant to DJF, finding it was probable he would benefit\nfrom the reformatory educational discipline or other treatment provided there, and that\nlocal resources were inappropriate.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n           I. The DJF Commitment Did Not Violate Ex Post Facto Principles\n       Appellant argues his commitment to DJF amounts to an unconstitutional ex post\nfacto law because such a commitment was not authorized when he committed his crimes\nin 2008 through 2009. (See U.S. Const., art. I, § 10; Cal. Const., art. I, § 9.) To place\nappellant’s argument in the proper context, some statutory background is in order.\n       A. DJF Commitments and 2007 Juvenile Realignment Legislation\n       Previous law placed an absolute bar on a DJF commitment only when the ward\nwas under 11 years of age or suffered from a contagious disease that would place others\n\n                                             5\n\fat risk. (See former § 733; Stats. 1992, ch. 10, § 5, p. 48, eff. Feb. 28, 1992.) In 2004,\nthe state entered into a consent decree to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of inmates of\nstate juvenile facilities. (In re Greg F. (2012) 55 Cal.4th 393, 409 (Greg F.).)\nRecognizing the state could not afford to comply with the terms of the decree, the\nLegislature enacted realignment legislation in 2007 that narrowed the class of juveniles\neligible for a DJF commitment and “ ‘ “shifted responsibility to the counties for all but\nthe most serious youth offenders.” ’ ” (Ibid.)\n         As part of this realignment legislation, section 731 was amended to add\nsubdivision (a)(4), allowing a commitment to DJF “if the ward has committed an offense\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of section 707 and is not otherwise ineligible for a\ncommitment to the division under Section 733.” (Stats. 2007, ch. 257, § 2, p. 2814,\neff. Sept. 29, 2007; see also Stats. 2007, ch. 175, § 19, p. 2089, eff. Aug. 24, 2007.)\nSection 733 was amended to provide that a ward could not be committed to DJF if, in\naddition to being under the age of 11 or having a contagious disease, “(c) The ward has\nbeen or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to Section 602, and the most recent\noffense alleged in any petition and admitted or found true by the court is not described in\nsubdivision (b) of Section 707, unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision\n(c) of section 290.008 of the Penal Code.”2 (Added by Stats. 2007, ch. 175, § 22,\np. 2090, eff. Aug. 24, 2007, amended by Stats. 2008, ch. 699, § 28, p. 4863, eff. Feb. 29,\n2012.)\n         Documents contained in the legislative history of the 2007 realignment suggest the\nLegislature did not intend to exclude juvenile sex offenders from DJF commitments.\nFloor analyses in both houses stated, “Juvenile sex offenders are excluded from this\n\n\n   2   Penal Code section 290.008, enacted in 2007, sets forth the sex offender\nregistration requirements for juveniles committed to DJF. (Stats. 2007, ch. 579, § 16,\np. 4811, eff. Oct. 13, 2007.) Subdivision (c) of section 290.008 lists the offenses for\nwhich such wards must register. The juvenile sex offender registration provisions were\nformerly contained in Penal Code section 290, subdivision (d), which was in effect at\nsome points relevant to our discussion. (Stats. 2006, ch. 337, § 11, p. 2591, eff. Sept. 20,\n2006.) We refer to section 290.008 throughout this opinion for the sake of clarity.\n                                              6\n\fchange and will not be impacted by this bill.” (Sen. Com. on Pub. Safety, Analysis of\nAssem. Bill No. 324 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) as amended Feb. 7, 2012, p. 7 [discussing\nSen. Bill No. 81 (2007-2008 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 19, 2007].) Assembly Bill No.\n191 (2007-2008 Reg. Sess.) was enacted in September 2007 to modify portions of Senate\nBill No. 81 to include, among other things, “conforming changes to ensure that none of\nthe juvenile justice reforms contained in [Senate Bill No.] 81 affect juveniles adjudicated\nof a sex offense as set forth in [Penal Code section 290.008].” (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of\nSen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 324 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.)\nas amended Feb. 7, 2012, p. 4, italics omitted.) Section 731.1, which was also enacted as\npart of the realignment, allowed a recall of wards previously committed to DJF “in the\ncase of any ward whose commitment offense was not an offense listed in subdivision (b)\nof Section 707, unless the offense was a sex offense set forth in subdivision (c) of Section\n290.008 of the Penal Code.” (Stats. 2007, ch. 257, § 2, p. 2814, eff. Sept. 29, 2007; see\nalso Stats. 2007, ch. 175, § 19, p. 2089, eff. Aug. 24, 2007, operative Sept. 1, 2007.) The\nlimitation on juvenile offenders eligible for a DJF commitment was “ ‘motivated by a\ndesire to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of juvenile confinement.’\n[Citation] . . . ‘[I]t is clear that the Legislature intended to preserve the possibility of\nDJF commitments for violent offenders and sex offenders.’ ” (Greg F., supra, 55 Cal.4th\nat p. 410.)\n       Notwithstanding this apparent intent to continue allowing DJF commitments for\nyouthful sex offenders, section 731, subdivision (a)(4), as enacted in 2007, purported to\nauthorize such a commitment only when the minor had committed an offense listed in\nsection 707, subdivision (b). Section 707, subdivision (b) lists 30 serious and violent\ncrimes, including many forcible sex offenses, but it does not include a number of\nnonforcible sex offenses that are listed in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), as\nreferenced in section 733, subdivision (c). Lewd conduct under Penal Code section 288,\nsubdivision (a) and continuous sexual abuse under Penal Code section 288.5 are among\nthe sex offenses that are listed in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), but do not\nappear in section 707, subdivision (b).\n\n                                               7\n\f       B. In re C.H.\n       In In re C.H. (2011) 53 Cal.4th 94 (C.H.), the state Supreme Court considered the\ncase of a minor who had been committed to DJF based solely on a violation of Penal\nCode section 288, subdivision (a). It held, “[A] juvenile court lacks authority to commit\na ward to the DJF under section 731[, subdivision] (a)(4) if that ward has never been\nadjudged to have committed an offense described in section 707[, subdivision] (b), even\nif his or her most recent offense alleged in a petition and admitted or found true by the\njuvenile court is a sex offense set forth in [Penal Code] section 290.008[, subdivision] (c)\nas referenced in section 733[, subdivision] (c).” (Id. at pp. 97-98.) The court explained,\n“Read together, sections 731[, subdivision] (a)(4) and 733[, subdivision] (c) limit the\nclass of wards who may be committed to the DJF to those wards who (1) have committed\nan offense described in section 707[, subdivision] (b) and (2) whose most recent offense\nalleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is listed either in\nsection 707[, subdivision] (b) or Penal Code section 290.008[, subdivision] (c).” (Id. at\np. 102.)\n       The court in C.H. declined to consider documents in the history of the 2007\nrealignment legislation that suggested the Legislature intended to permit juvenile sex\noffenders to be committed to DJF. “[O]nly when a statute’s language is ambiguous or\nsusceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation may we turn to extrinsic aids to\nassist in interpretation.” (C.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 107.) Because sections 731,\nsubdivision (a)(4) and 733, subdivision (c) had a plain meaning that did not yield absurd\nresults, it would be inappropriate to “resort to the legislative history . . . to consider\nwhether an otherwise undisclosed legislative intent might be reflected.” (Ibid.)\n       C. 2012 Amendments—Assembly Bill No. 324\n       In response to C.H., the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 324 ((2011-2012\nReg. Sess.)) as urgency legislation effective February 29, 2012. (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 4.)\nThe bill amended section 731, subdivision (a)(4) to authorize a DJF commitment when\nthe ward “has committed an offense described in subdivision (b) of Section 707 or\nsubdivision (c) of Section 290.008 of the Penal Code, and is not otherwise ineligible for\n\n                                                8\n\fcommitment to the division under Section 733.” (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 1, italics added.)\nSection 733, subdivision (c) was amended to preclude a DJF commitment when “the\nmost recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court\nis not described in subdivision (b) of Section 707 or subdivision (c) of Section 290.008 of\nthe Penal Code.” (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 2.)\n         In addition to clarifying that a DJF commitment is authorized for a ward who\ncommitted a sex offense listed in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), even if the\noffense was not also listed in section 707, subdivision (b), Assembly Bill No. 324 (2011-\n2012 Reg. Sess.) added section 1752.16 to address the situation of wards who would\notherwise be entitled to release from DJF under the authority of C.H: “(a) The chief of\n[DJF] . . . may enter into contracts with any county of this state for the [DJF] to furnish\nhousing to a ward who was in the custody of the [DJF] on December 12, 2011, and\nwhose commitment was recalled based on both of the following: (1) The ward was\ncommitted to [DJF] for the commission of an offense described in subdivision (c) of\nSection 290.008 of the Penal Code. [¶] (2) The ward has not been adjudged a ward of the\ncourt pursuant to Section 602 for commission of an offense described in subdivision (b)\nof Section 707. [¶] (b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to address the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s ruling in [C.H.].” (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 3, eff. Feb. 29, 2012.)\n         D. Ex Post Facto Analysis\n         It is against the foregoing backdrop that we consider appellant’s ex post facto\nclaim.\n         The state and federal ex post facto clauses have the same meaning and apply to\njuvenile wardship proceedings. (John L. v. Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 158, 171-\n172 (John L.); In re Melvin J. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 742, 760, overruled on other\ngrounds in John L., at p. 181, fn. 7.) To fall within the ex post facto provisions, “ ‘two\ncritical elements’ ” must be met. (John L., at p. 172.) “First, the law must be\nretroactive.” (Ibid.) Second, “the law must have one of the following four effects: it\nmakes criminal acts that were innocent when done; it makes the crime greater or more\naggravated than it was when committed; it inflicts a greater punishment for the crime\n\n                                               9\n\fthan was available when the crime was committed; or it alters the rules of evidence or the\nrequired proof for conviction.” (In re Robert M. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1186\n(Robert M.).)\n       Appellant argues that in committing him to DJF, the juvenile court retroactively\napplied the 2012 amendment to section 731, subdivision (a)(4) and inflicted a greater\npunishment than was available when he committed his offenses. The People\nacknowledge the 2012 amendment was applied retroactively, but contend there is no ex\npost facto problem because a DJF commitment does not constitute greater punishment\nthan the local commitments that were available when appellant committed the offenses.\nWe agree with the People.\n       1. A DJF Commitment Is Not Greater Punishment than a Local Placement\n       A juvenile ward’s treatment under the delinquency law has a different focus than\npunishment under adult criminal statutes. “Significant differences between the juvenile\nand adult offender laws underscore their different goals: The former seeks to rehabilitate,\nwhile the latter seeks to punish.” (In re Julian R. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 487, 496 (Julian R.);\nsee § 202, subd. (a).) Though punishment is an appropriate consideration when it\npromotes the ultimate goal of rehabilitation, punishment under the juvenile law may not\nbe used as a form of retribution. (Julian R., at p. 496; see § 202, subd. (e).)\n       Although a DJF commitment has been described as more “restrictive” than any\nother disposition for juvenile wards (Greg F., supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 404), it does not\namount to greater punishment because it does not increase the time a ward must spend in\ncustody. Whenever a ward is removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian,\n“the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a\nperiod in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an\nadult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the\njurisdiction of the juvenile court.” (§ 726, subd. (d).) A ward committed to DJF may not\nbe held in excess of the maximum term of confinement described in section 726; and,\nadditionally, the juvenile court may specify a lesser period of confinement “based upon\nthe facts and circumstances of the matter or matters that brought or continued the ward\n\n                                             10\n\funder the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.” (§ 731, subd. (c); Julian R., supra, 47\nCal.4th at p. 498.) Juvenile offenders committed to DJF are, like other wards, generally\nsubject to juvenile court jurisdiction only until the age of 21, or 25 if the ward was\nbrought within the court’s jurisdiction for an offense under section 707, subdivision (b).\n(§§ 607, subds. (a)-(c), 1769, subds. (a)-(c).)\n       Sections 731 and 733, setting forth the potential dispositions for a juvenile ward,\n“do not address punishment or penalties for criminal offenses. Rather, they govern where\na juvenile delinquent may serve time for purposes of rehabilitation.” (In re Carl N.\n(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 423, 438 (Carl N.).) Accordingly, courts have concluded the\namendments to sections 731 and 733 under the 2007 realignment legislation, which\neliminated DJF as a possible disposition in most cases, did not amount to a mitigation of\npunishment. (In re N.D. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 885, 891 (N.D.); Carl N., at p. 438.) By\na parity of reasoning, the 2012 amendments to sections 731 and 733, which revived the\navailability of a DJF commitment for certain sex offenders, cannot be logically viewed as\nan increase in punishment for purposes of ex post facto analysis.\n       2. In re Robert M. and the Nonpenal Consequences of a DJF Commitment\n       Both appellant and the People argue their position is supported by the decision in\nRobert M., in which the defendant was committed to DJF based solely on a lewd act\nunder section 288, subdivision (a) that occurred after the 2007 realignment legislation.\n(Robert M., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1181.) In that case, the defendant’s DJF\ncommitment was recalled pursuant to the decision in C.H., and the juvenile court\nauthorized the probation officer to seek housing at DJF for the purpose of completing sex\noffender treatment there, as authorized by newly enacted section 1752.16. On appeal, the\ncourt rejected the defendant’s ex post facto challenge to the housing order, concluding it\ndid not increase the defendant’s punishment because it merely created another treatment\noption in a different location than local programs. (Id. at p. 1186.)\n       The People argue the Robert M. court’s characterization of housing at DJF as\nsimply another treatment option is equally true for a DJF commitment. Appellant notes\nthat elsewhere in its opinion, the Robert M. court emphasized the difference between\n\n                                              11\n\fsuch an order and a commitment to DJF: “A commitment to DJF and a commitment to\njuvenile hall with housing at DJF are distinctly different orders with different results.\nFirst, a ward committed to DJF who has committed any of the wide variety of sex crimes\nlisted in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), is required to register as a sex\noffender pursuant to Penal Code section 290, subdivision (b). . . . There is no similar\nrequirement for wards committed to juvenile hall for the same sexual offenses. . . .\nSecond, after a ward is committed to DJF, the decision to release the ward from custody\nresides with the Juvenile Parole Board.” (Robert M., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1182-\n1183.)\n         The portion of the Robert M. decision cited by appellant does not appear in the\ncourt’s ex post facto analysis, but in a portion of the discussion rejecting a distinct claim\nthat the housing order was a “ ‘transparent procedural subterfuge’ ” to avoid the holding\nof C.H. The court distinguished a housing order at DJF from a commitment to DJF to\nshow the housing order was not “merely a semantically different authorization of the\nsame punishment declared impermissible in In re C.H.” (Robert M., supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at p. 1183.) Robert M. did not consider the different question of whether a\nDJF commitment would amount to an ex post facto law if applied to a juvenile whose\nnon-section 707, subdivision (b) offense was committed after the 2007 realignment\nlegislation, but before Assembly Bill No. 324 went into effect in 2012. “[I]t is axiomatic\nthat cases are not authority for propositions not considered.” (People v. Alvarez (2002)\n27 Cal.4th 1161, 1176.) More significantly, the differences between a DJF commitment\nand a DJF housing order noted in Robert M. do not persuade us that the former amounts\nto an increase in punishment.\n         The Robert M. court noted that a juvenile committed to DJF for a sex offense\nenumerated in Penal Code section 290.008 must register as a sex offender upon release,\nwhereas wards placed locally for the same sex offenses are not required to register.\n(Robert M., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1182-1183.) Sex offender registration is a\ncivil regulatory scheme, rather than punishment, for ex post facto purposes. (Smith v.\nDoe (2003) 538 U.S. 84, 92-96; People v. Castellanos (1999) 21 Cal.4th 785, 799-800;\n\n                                              12\n\fPeople v. Allen (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 999, 1001-1003.) If sex offender registration is\nnot punishment, a DJF commitment is not greater punishment by virtue of a registration\nrequirement.\n       Similarly, the Robert M. court’s observation that a DJF commitment consigns the\ndecision concerning a ward’s release to that facility, rather than the juvenile court (Robert\nM., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1183), does not mean that a DJF commitment is an\nincrease in punishment. Nothing in the record suggests a ward committed to DJF must be\nconfined for a greater length of time than one committed to a local program. (See In re\nA.G. (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 791, 805, fn. 12 [length of juvenile’s DJF commitment\ndetermined by DJF, with maximum term set by juvenile court serving as an upper limit].)\n       Finally, we are cognizant that a ward committed to DJF may be detained past the\nage of 21 (or 25, for a section 707, subdivision (b) offense) when a petition is sustained\nunder section 1800 et seq., which allows for an extended commitment in two-year\nincrements when the ward “would be physically dangerous to the public because of the\nperson’s mental or physical deficiency, disorder, or abnormality that causes the person to\nhave serious difficulty controlling his or her dangerous behavior.” (§ 1800, subd. (a); see\n§§ 607, subds. (a)-(c), 1769.) This procedure, which includes the right to a jury trial and\na standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is civil in nature and “involves neither a\njuvenile proceeding nor an extension of a prior juvenile court proceeding.” (In re\nHoward N. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 117, 126.) It is akin to civil commitment procedures in\nadult court, to which ex post facto principles do not apply. (See Hubbart v. Superior\nCourt (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1171 [sexually violent predator commitment under § 6600\net seq. not penal and not an ex post facto law]; People v. Robinson (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th\n348, 350-352 [mentally disordered offender commitment under § 2960 et seq. not penal\nin nature and not an ex post facto law].) Appellant’s potential exposure to proceedings\nunder section 1800 if committed to DJF does not render DJF a harsher punishment.3\n\n\n   3    In In re Valenzuela (1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 483, the court found a prior version of\nthe extended commitment procedure under section 1800 et seq. to be penal rather than\ncivil in nature, because a ward over 21 could be transferred to state prison for housing.\n                                             13\n\f                   II. The Juvenile Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion\n                             in Committing Appellant to DJF\n       Appellant argues the DJF commitment, even if authorized by law, was\ninappropriate given the facts of his case. He argues the court should have followed the\nprobation officer’s recommendation to release him to the home of his aunt subject to his\nparticipation in an outpatient juvenile sex offender treatment program. We disagree.\n       “No ward of the juvenile court shall be committed to [DJF] unless the judge of the\ncourt is fully satisfied that the mental and physical condition and qualifications of the\nward are such as to render it probable that he will be benefited by the reformatory\neducational discipline or other treatment provided by [DJF].” (§ 734.) A commitment\ndecision is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion, indulging all reasonable inferences\nto support the juvenile court’s judgment. (In re Angela M. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1392,\n1396.) “We have no power to judge the effect or value of the evidence, to weigh the\nevidence, to consider the credibility of witnesses or to resolve conflicts in the evidence or\nthe reasonable inferences which may be drawn from that evidence.” (In re Casey D.\n(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 38, 52-53.) “A [DJF] commitment is not an abuse of discretion\nwhere the evidence demonstrates a probable benefit to the minor from the commitment\nand less restrictive alternatives would be ineffective or inappropriate.” (In re M.S. (2009)\n174 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1250.)\n       The juvenile court in this case did not abuse its discretion in concluding a DJF\ncommitment was necessary because outpatient treatment would be ineffective. Appellant\nhad made little, if any, progress toward rehabilitation. He had performed poorly in two\n\n\nUnder current law, a ward over 21 who is the subject of a section 1800 commitment may\nbe transferred to the Director of Corrections for “placement in an appropriate institution.”\n(§ 1802.) An “appropriate institution” would necessarily be a facility in which the person\ncommitted would receive special treatment for his or her mental disorder. Any attempt to\nhouse a section 1800 committee in the general prison population would be subject to\nchallenge on constitutional grounds and we have no reason to believe such a placement\norder would be made. (See People v. Feagley (1975) 14 Cal.3d 338, 375 [housing\nnontreatable mentally disordered sex offenders in general prison population is cruel and\nunusual punishment].)\n                                             14\n\flocal residential treatment programs, lacked insight into his issues, demonstrated\ncontinuing behavioral problems, and was assessed to have a moderate to high risk of\nreoffense. The probation officer had “grave concerns [appellant] will sexually re-\noffend,” and would have recommended a local residential program if one had been\navailable. Paull, though willing to accept appellant into the A Step Forward outpatient\nprogram, was in favor of appellant first receiving all the inpatient treatment available.\nThe sex offender treatment program at DJF, as described by Hunter, was inpatient, highly\nstructured and comprehensive. The juvenile court’s decision to commit appellant to DJF\nrather than placing him on probation with outpatient treatment was reasonable under the\ncircumstances.\n                        III. The Probation Terms Must be Stricken\n       At the dispositional hearing at which appellant was committed to DJF, the juvenile\ncourt set forth a number of probation terms for appellant to follow. Appellant argues that\nto the extent these terms pertained to the DJF commitment, and not simply the time he\nwas to spend in juvenile hall pending his transfer to DJF, they are invalid. We agree,\nbecause the juvenile court loses the authority to impose conditions of probation once it\ncommits a ward to DJF. (In re Ronny P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1204, 1208; In re\nAllen N. (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 513, 516.)\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The probation conditions imposed by the court in its dispositional order of April 8,\n2013, committing appellant to DJF, are stricken. As so modified, the judgment is\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                     NEEDHAM, J.\n\n\n\nWe concur.\n\n\n\n\nJONES, P.J.\n\n\n\n\nBRUINIERS, J.\n\n\n\n\n(A138468)\n\n                16\n\fSuperior Court of Contra Costa County, No. J0900801, Lewis A.

Ct. No. J0900801)\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n        Edward C. was declared a ward of the juvenile court under Welfare and\nInstitutions Code section 6021 after he admitted two counts of continuous sexual abuse of\na child under Penal Code section 288.5. He appeals from an order committing him to the\nDivision of Juvenile Facilities (DJF) after he violated probation and a supplemental\npetition was found true. Appellant argues the commitment amounts to an ex post facto\nlaw because DJF was not an authorized placement for his offenses at the time of their\ncommission. (See U.S. Const., art. I, § 10; Cal. Const., art. I, § 9.) He further argues a\nDJF commitment was an abuse of discretion in light of the less restrictive alternatives\navailable. We reject both claims and, in light of the valid DJF commitment, strike the\nprobation conditions imposed by the juvenile court.\n\n\n\n\n    1 Further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n                                             1\n\f                                      BACKGROUND\n         In 2009, when he was 14 years old, appellant was discovered touching his 10-\nyear-old half brother inappropriately. The half brother revealed appellant had been\nengaging in sexual activity with him and with his 8-year-old sister (appellant’s half sister)\nduring the previous two years. The acts occurred several times a week, and included oral\ncopulation and attempted anal and vaginal intercourse.\n         A petition was filed under section 602 charging appellant with multiple sexual\noffenses. He was declared a ward of the juvenile court after admitting two counts of\ncontinuous sexual abuse of a child under Penal Code section 288.5, between January 10,\n2008 and May 7, 2009, in exchange for a dismissal of the other charges. Appellant was\ngranted probation and placed in the residential juvenile sex offenders treatment program\nat Martins’ Achievement Place (MAP), where he remained for the next two and one-half\nyears.\n         Appellant’s progress at MAP was uneven. He had a profound speech problem\nmaking it difficult for others to understand him, was believed to be dyslexic, and\npotentially fell on the autism spectrum. In a probation report filed in September 2010, his\nbehavior was noted to be improving, but a few months later he admitted a probation\nviolation after having consensual sex with his roommate and another resident. He was\nseen by staff as “struggling” in treatment: minimizing his offenses, falling into a “victim\nrole” when confronted, and avoiding the emotions necessary to develop empathy.\n         In a report dated May 6, 2011, the probation officer stated appellant was “fully\nengaged in treatment and has made a significant amount of progress” since being moved\nto a different house at MAP. On February 14, 2012, however, appellant admitted he had\nviolated probation because he was not progressing in his program and had failed to\ncomplete several of his sex offender treatment assignments. He remained in his\nplacement at MAP and his attitude improved after he began taking prescription\nantidepressant medication. But problems continued as he persisted in sexualized and\naggressive behavior, showing little insight into his issues.\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        On April 27, 2012, the probation officer filed a notice alleging appellant had\nviolated probation by failing to follow the rules and regulations at MAP. The\naccompanying report noted that appellant was having difficulties completing his\ntreatment-related assignments and described an incident in which he had been discovered\nin his room with his pants pulled down below his buttocks in the presence of two\nroommates. The probation officer recommended a change in placement, as appellant had\nbeen at MAP for two and one-half years and made “little to no progress.” The probation\nviolation was dismissed contingent on appellant’s placement in a different treatment\nprogram.\n        Appellant was placed in the Breaking the Cycle (BTC) program in May 2012, but\nhad difficulty following the rules and received several incident reports based on his\ninappropriate behavior with respect to boundaries, his “grooming” of other residents and\nstaff with sexualized behavior, and his writing in a journal that was sexual in content and\nincluded graphics illustrating a penis. A quarterly report on his progress indicated\nappellant showed little ability or willingness to curtail his inappropriate conduct and did\nnot appear to understand the severity of his situation, focusing more on perceived\nviolations of his own rights.\n        Appellant turned 18 in November 2012. On November 7, the probation officer\nfiled a notice alleging appellant had violated probation by failing to obey the staff at his\ncourt-ordered placement and by failing to fully participate in his sex offender treatment\nprogram. On that same date, the district attorney filed a supplemental petition under\nsections 602 and 778 seeking continuing jurisdiction over appellant and a modification of\nhis placement, as he would not be permitted to remain in the BTC program past his 18th\nbirthday. (See § 607, subd. (a) [juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over ward until age\n21].)\n        The court held a combined hearing on the probation violation and supplemental\npetition on December 11, 2012. Rebecca Baker, the director of BTC, testified there were\nthree phases to their program, which were expected to take six months to complete, but\nappellant had not finished Phase 1 during his time there. He had failed to complete\n\n                                              3\n\fassignments or engage meaningfully in individual therapy, had repeatedly violated the\nrules, and had shown a “poor” level of participation in group therapy. The court found by\nclear and convincing evidence that appellant had violated probation and sustained the\nsupplemental petition.\n       The court ordered appellant screened for different prospective placements.\nBecause appellant was 18 years old with a high school diploma, he was ineligible for\nplacement in any local residential program, the only options being the inpatient sex\noffender treatment available at DJF or an outpatient program. At the contested\ndispositional hearing, the district attorney urged the court to commit appellant to DJF.\nDefense counsel argued a commitment to DJF would constitute an ex post facto law,\nbecause that disposition was not available when appellant committed his offenses. The\nprobation officer recommended that appellant be released to live with his aunt and treated\nas an outpatient.\n       Krys Hunter, DJF’s acting senior supervising clinical psychologist, testified about\nthe DJF sex offender treatment program available at two facilities, each having four units\ncomprised of a maximum of 36 youths, staffed by two clinicians, a senior counselor,\nseveral youth counselors, two casework specialists or parole agents, and a treatment team\nspecialist. The curriculum, which was recently revised to take into account research on\njuvenile sex offenders in particular, consists of seven stages and is designed to be\ncompleted in 18 to 24 months, including an eight- to ten-week orientation period focusing\non healthy living. The youths in the program are assessed and segregated based on their\nrisk of reoffense, and if they finish early are able to become mentors or take vocational\ntraining. The treatment includes components of group and individual therapy, resource\ngroups designed to address other issues such as substance abuse or anger management,\njournals, role-playing assignments, the discussion of various books, and family therapy.\nAccording to Hunter, the program was integrated into every aspect of the youth’s life at\nDJF and was designed to prevent future criminality in general, not merely the sex\noffenses that led to the commitment. Family members were encouraged to participate in\n\n\n                                             4\n\ffamily therapy to keep them in touch with the youth and to help prepare the youth for\neventual release.\n       Arthur Paull, the director of A Step Forward, a juvenile sex offender outpatient\ntreatment program, had screened appellant for the program and found him to be at\nmoderate risk of reoffending. At the dispositional hearing, he testified appellant would\nreceive one or two hours a week of individual therapy if admitted to A Step Forward,\nalong with monthly family therapy and quarterly case conferences as needed. If appellant\nwere to participate in that program while residing with his aunt, as the probation\ndepartment had recommended, the staff at A Step Forward would have to rely on honest,\ncomplete reporting from her to know whether appellant was at risk of reoffending. Paull\ndid not think a DJF commitment would be productive because appellant had not done\nwell in other residential programs; and, accordingly, he recommended an outpatient plan\nwith a suspended DJF commitment rather than a straight commitment to DJF. He\nbelieved appellant would benefit from a structured outpatient program with good\nsupervision, but had appellant not turned 18, he would have recommended a return to the\nMAP residential program. Paull believed appellant should get the maximum amount of\nresidential treatment available before participating in A Step Forward.\n       The court committed appellant to DJF, finding it was probable he would benefit\nfrom the reformatory educational discipline or other treatment provided there, and that\nlocal resources were inappropriate.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n           I. The DJF Commitment Did Not Violate Ex Post Facto Principles\n       Appellant argues his commitment to DJF amounts to an unconstitutional ex post\nfacto law because such a commitment was not authorized when he committed his crimes\nin 2008 through 2009. (See U.S. Const., art. I, § 10; Cal. Const., art. I, § 9.) To place\nappellant’s argument in the proper context, some statutory background is in order.\n       A. DJF Commitments and 2007 Juvenile Realignment Legislation\n       Previous law placed an absolute bar on a DJF commitment only when the ward\nwas under 11 years of age or suffered from a contagious disease that would place others\n\n                                             5\n\fat risk. (See former § 733; Stats. 1992, ch. 10, § 5, p. 48, eff. Feb. 28, 1992.) In 2004,\nthe state entered into a consent decree to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of inmates of\nstate juvenile facilities. (In re Greg F. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409 (Greg F.).)\nRecognizing the state could not afford to comply with the terms of the decree, the\nLegislature enacted realignment legislation in 2007 that narrowed the class of juveniles\neligible for a DJF commitment and “ ‘ “shifted responsibility to the counties for all but\nthe most serious youth offenders.” ’ ” (Ibid.)\n         As part of this realignment legislation, section 731 was amended to add\nsubdivision (a)(4), allowing a commitment to DJF “if the ward has committed an offense\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of section 707 and is not otherwise ineligible for a\ncommitment to the division under Section 733.” (Stats. 2007, ch. 257, § 2, p. 2814,\neff. Sept. 29, 2007; see also Stats. 2007, ch. 175, § 19, p. 2089, eff. Aug. 24, 2007.)\nSection 733 was amended to provide that a ward could not be committed to DJF if, in\naddition to being under the age of 11 or having a contagious disease, “(c) The ward has\nbeen or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to Section 602, and the most recent\noffense alleged in any petition and admitted or found true by the court is not described in\nsubdivision (b) of Section 707, unless the offense is a sex offense set forth in subdivision\n(c) of section 290.008 of the Penal Code.”2 (Added by Stats. 2007, ch. 175, § 22,\np. 2090, eff. Aug. 24, 2007, amended by Stats. 2008, ch. 699, § 28, p. 4863, eff. Feb. 29,\n2012.)\n         Documents contained in the legislative history of the 2007 realignment suggest the\nLegislature did not intend to exclude juvenile sex offenders from DJF commitments.\nFloor analyses in both houses stated, “Juvenile sex offenders are excluded from this\n\n\n   2   Penal Code section 290.008, enacted in 2007, sets forth the sex offender\nregistration requirements for juveniles committed to DJF.

The juvenile sex offender registration provisions were\nformerly contained in Penal Code section 290, subdivision (d), which was in effect at\nsome points relevant to our discussion.

Sess.) was enacted in September 2007 to modify portions of Senate\nBill No. 81 to include, among other things, “conforming changes to ensure that none of\nthe juvenile justice reforms contained in [Senate Bill No.] 81 affect juveniles adjudicated\nof a sex offense as set forth in [Penal Code section 290.008].” (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of\nSen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 324 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.)\nas amended Feb. 7, 2012, p. 4, italics omitted.) Section 731.1, which was also enacted as\npart of the realignment, allowed a recall of wards previously committed to DJF “in the\ncase of any ward whose commitment offense was not an offense listed in subdivision (b)\nof Section 707, unless the offense was a sex offense set forth in subdivision (c) of Section\n290.008 of the Penal Code.” (Stats. 2007, ch. 257, § 2, p. 2814, eff. Sept. 29, 2007; see\nalso Stats. 2007, ch. 175, § 19, p. 2089, eff. Aug. 24, 2007, operative Sept. 1, 2007.) The\nlimitation on juvenile offenders eligible for a DJF commitment was “ ‘motivated by a\ndesire to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of juvenile confinement.’\n[Citation] . . . ‘[I]t is clear that the Legislature intended to preserve the possibility of\nDJF commitments for violent offenders and sex offenders.’ ” (Greg F., supra, 55 Cal.4th\nat p. 410.)\n       Notwithstanding this apparent intent to continue allowing DJF commitments for\nyouthful sex offenders, section 731, subdivision (a)(4), as enacted in 2007, purported to\nauthorize such a commitment only when the minor had committed an offense listed in\nsection 707, subdivision (b). Section 707, subdivision (b) lists 30 serious and violent\ncrimes, including many forcible sex offenses, but it does not include a number of\nnonforcible sex offenses that are listed in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), as\nreferenced in section 733, subdivision (c). Lewd conduct under Penal Code section 288,\nsubdivision (a) and continuous sexual abuse under Penal Code section 288.5 are among\nthe sex offenses that are listed in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), but do not\nappear in section 707, subdivision (b).\n\n                                               7\n\f       B.

It held, “[A] juvenile court lacks authority to commit\na ward to the DJF under section 731[, subdivision] (a)(4) if that ward has never been\nadjudged to have committed an offense described in section 707[, subdivision] (b), even\nif his or her most recent offense alleged in a petition and admitted or found true by the\njuvenile court is a sex offense set forth in [Penal Code] section 290.008[, subdivision] (c)\nas referenced in section 733[, subdivision] (c).” (Id. at pp. 97-98.) The court explained,\n“Read together, sections 731[, subdivision] (a)(4) and 733[, subdivision] (c) limit the\nclass of wards who may be committed to the DJF to those wards who (1) have committed\nan offense described in section 707[, subdivision] (b) and (2) whose most recent offense\nalleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is listed either in\nsection 707[, subdivision] (b) or Penal Code section 290.008[, subdivision] (c).” (Id. at\np. 102.)\n       The court in C.H. declined to consider documents in the history of the 2007\nrealignment legislation that suggested the Legislature intended to permit juvenile sex\noffenders to be committed to DJF. “[O]nly when a statute’s language is ambiguous or\nsusceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation may we turn to extrinsic aids to\nassist in interpretation.” (C.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 107.) Because sections 731,\nsubdivision (a)(4) and 733, subdivision (c) had a plain meaning that did not yield absurd\nresults, it would be inappropriate to “resort to the legislative history . . . to consider\nwhether an otherwise undisclosed legislative intent might be reflected.” (Ibid.)\n       C. 2012 Amendments—Assembly Bill No. 324\n       In response to C.H., the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 324 ((2011-2012\nReg. Sess.)) as urgency legislation effective February 29, 2012. (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 4.)\nThe bill amended section 731, subdivision (a)(4) to authorize a DJF commitment when\nthe ward “has committed an offense described in subdivision (b) of Section 707 or\nsubdivision (c) of Section 290.008 of the Penal Code, and is not otherwise ineligible for\n\n                                                8\n\fcommitment to the division under Section 733.” (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 1, italics added.)\nSection 733, subdivision (c) was amended to preclude a DJF commitment when “the\nmost recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court\nis not described in subdivision (b) of Section 707 or subdivision (c) of Section 290.008 of\nthe Penal Code.” (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 2.)\n         In addition to clarifying that a DJF commitment is authorized for a ward who\ncommitted a sex offense listed in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), even if the\noffense was not also listed in section 707, subdivision (b), Assembly Bill No. 324 (2011-\n2012 Reg. Sess.) added section 1752.16 to address the situation of wards who would\notherwise be entitled to release from DJF under the authority of C.H: “(a) The chief of\n[DJF] . . . may enter into contracts with any county of this state for the [DJF] to furnish\nhousing to a ward who was in the custody of the [DJF] on December 12, 2011, and\nwhose commitment was recalled based on both of the following: (1) The ward was\ncommitted to [DJF] for the commission of an offense described in subdivision (c) of\nSection 290.008 of the Penal Code. [¶] (2) The ward has not been adjudged a ward of the\ncourt pursuant to Section 602 for commission of an offense described in subdivision (b)\nof Section 707. [¶] (b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to address the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s ruling in [C.H.].” (Stats. 2012, ch. 7, § 3, eff. Feb. 29, 2012.)\n         D. Ex Post Facto Analysis\n         It is against the foregoing backdrop that we consider appellant’s ex post facto\nclaim.\n         The state and federal ex post facto clauses have the same meaning and apply to\njuvenile wardship proceedings.

Second, “the law must have one of the following four effects: it\nmakes criminal acts that were innocent when done; it makes the crime greater or more\naggravated than it was when committed; it inflicts a greater punishment for the crime\n\n                                               9\n\fthan was available when the crime was committed; or it alters the rules of evidence or the\nrequired proof for conviction.” (In re Robert M.

The People\nacknowledge the 2012 amendment was applied retroactively, but contend there is no ex\npost facto problem because a DJF commitment does not constitute greater punishment\nthan the local commitments that were available when appellant committed the offenses.\nWe agree with the People.\n       1. A DJF Commitment Is Not Greater Punishment than a Local Placement\n       A juvenile ward’s treatment under the delinquency law has a different focus than\npunishment under adult criminal statutes. “Significant differences between the juvenile\nand adult offender laws underscore their different goals: The former seeks to rehabilitate,\nwhile the latter seeks to punish.” (In re Julian R. (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801881\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801881/in-re-julian-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496 (Julian R.);\nsee § 202, subd. (a).) Though punishment is an appropriate consideration when it\npromotes the ultimate goal of rehabilitation, punishment under the juvenile law may not\nbe used as a form of retribution. (Julian R., at p. 496; see § 202, subd. (e).)\n       Although a DJF commitment has been described as more “restrictive” than any\nother disposition for juvenile wards (Greg F., supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 404), it does not\namount to greater punishment because it does not increase the time a ward must spend in\ncustody. Whenever a ward is removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian,\n“the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a\nperiod in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an\nadult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the\njurisdiction of the juvenile court.” (§ 726, subd. (d).) A ward committed to DJF may not\nbe held in excess of the maximum term of confinement described in section 726; and,\nadditionally, the juvenile court may specify a lesser period of confinement “based upon\nthe facts and circumstances of the matter or matters that brought or continued the ward\n\n                                             10\n\funder the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.” (§ 731, subd. (c); Julian R., supra, 47\nCal.4th at p. 498.) Juvenile offenders committed to DJF are, like other wards, generally\nsubject to juvenile court jurisdiction only until the age of 21, or 25 if the ward was\nbrought within the court’s jurisdiction for an offense under section 707, subdivision (b).\n(§§ 607, subds. (a)-(c), 1769, subds. (a)-(c).)\n       Sections 731 and 733, setting forth the potential dispositions for a juvenile ward,\n“do not address punishment or penalties for criminal offenses. Rather, they govern where\na juvenile delinquent may serve time for purposes of rehabilitation.” (In re Carl N.\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2279570\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279570/in-re-carl-n/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Accordingly, courts have concluded the\namendments to sections 731 and 733 under the 2007 realignment legislation, which\neliminated DJF as a possible disposition in most cases, did not amount to a mitigation of\npunishment. (In re N.D. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 891 (N.D.); Carl N., at p. 438.) By\na parity of reasoning, the 2012 amendments to sections 731 and 733, which revived the\navailability of a DJF commitment for certain sex offenders, cannot be logically viewed as\nan increase in punishment for purposes of ex post facto analysis.\n       2. In re Robert M. and the Nonpenal Consequences of a DJF Commitment\n       Both appellant and the People argue their position is supported by the decision in\nRobert M., in which the defendant was committed to DJF based solely on a lewd act\nunder section 288, subdivision (a) that occurred after the 2007 realignment legislation.\n(Robert M., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1181.) In that case, the defendant’s DJF\ncommitment was recalled pursuant to the decision in C.H., and the juvenile court\nauthorized the probation officer to seek housing at DJF for the purpose of completing sex\noffender treatment there, as authorized by newly enacted section 1752.16. On appeal, the\ncourt rejected the defendant’s ex post facto challenge to the housing order, concluding it\ndid not increase the defendant’s punishment because it merely created another treatment\noption in a different location than local programs. (Id. at p. 1186.)\n       The People argue the Robert M. court’s characterization of housing at DJF as\nsimply another treatment option is equally true for a DJF commitment. Appellant notes\nthat elsewhere in its opinion, the Robert M. court emphasized the difference between\n\n                                              11\n\fsuch an order and a commitment to DJF: “A commitment to DJF and a commitment to\njuvenile hall with housing at DJF are distinctly different orders with different results.\nFirst, a ward committed to DJF who has committed any of the wide variety of sex crimes\nlisted in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), is required to register as a sex\noffender pursuant to Penal Code section 290, subdivision (b). . . . There is no similar\nrequirement for wards committed to juvenile hall for the same sexual offenses. . . .\nSecond, after a ward is committed to DJF, the decision to release the ward from custody\nresides with the Juvenile Parole Board.” (Robert M., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1182-\n1183.)\n         The portion of the Robert M. decision cited by appellant does not appear in the\ncourt’s ex post facto analysis, but in a portion of the discussion rejecting a distinct claim\nthat the housing order was a “ ‘transparent procedural subterfuge’ ” to avoid the holding\nof C.H. The court distinguished a housing order at DJF from a commitment to DJF to\nshow the housing order was not “merely a semantically different authorization of the\nsame punishment declared impermissible in In re C.H.” (Robert M., supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at p. 1183.) Robert M. did not consider the different question of whether a\nDJF commitment would amount to an ex post facto law if applied to a juvenile whose\nnon-section 707, subdivision (b) offense was committed after the 2007 realignment\nlegislation, but before Assembly Bill No. 324 went into effect in 2012. “[I]t is axiomatic\nthat cases are not authority for propositions not considered.” (People v. Alvarez (2002)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637003\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637003/people-v-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176.) More significantly, the differences between a DJF commitment\nand a DJF housing order noted in Robert M. do not persuade us that the former amounts\nto an increase in punishment.\n         The Robert M. court noted that a juvenile committed to DJF for a sex offense\nenumerated in Penal Code section 290.008 must register as a sex offender upon release,\nwhereas wards placed locally for the same sex offenses are not required to register.\n(Robert M., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1182-1183.) Sex offender registration is a\ncivil regulatory scheme, rather than punishment, for ex post facto purposes.

If sex offender registration is\nnot punishment, a DJF commitment is not greater punishment by virtue of a registration\nrequirement.\n       Similarly, the Robert M. court’s observation that a DJF commitment consigns the\ndecision concerning a ward’s release to that facility, rather than the juvenile court (Robert\nM., supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1183), does not mean that a DJF commitment is an\nincrease in punishment. Nothing in the record suggests a ward committed to DJF must be\nconfined for a greater length of time than one committed to a local program. (See In re\nA.G.

(a); see\n§§ 607, subds. (a)-(c), 1769.) This procedure, which includes the right to a jury trial and\na standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is civil in nature and “involves neither a\njuvenile proceeding nor an extension of a prior juvenile court proceeding.” (In re\nHoward N.

We disagree.\n       “No ward of the juvenile court shall be committed to [DJF] unless the judge of the\ncourt is fully satisfied that the mental and physical condition and qualifications of the\nward are such as to render it probable that he will be benefited by the reformatory\neducational discipline or other treatment provided by [DJF].” (§ 734.) A commitment\ndecision is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion, indulging all reasonable inferences\nto support the juvenile court’s judgment. (In re Angela M.
