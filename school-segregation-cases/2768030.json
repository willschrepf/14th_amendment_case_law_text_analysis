Edwards, Rob Orr, ERA Orr &amp;\r\nAssociates (collectively, “Appellees”) and others alleging statutory and common law\r\nfraudulent inducement, DTPA violations, and negligent misrepresentation.  The Fletchers\r\nallege that Edwards, a real estate agent, represented to them that they could get a water\r\nconnection to a lot which they ultimately purchased, when in fact they could not obtain the\r\nnecessary connection because of a lack of easements across an adjoining lot.  The court granted\r\na summary judgment in Appellees’ favor.  The Fletchers present the following ten issues in\r\nthis appeal:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>were the “as is” clauses in the documents they signed with the seller Donald L.\r\nWallace a part of the bargain between Wallace and themselves;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>if so, did these clauses “survive the June 5, 1991 closing at the title company”;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>are Orr and ERA jointly and severally liable for Edwards’s alleged representations\r\nconcerning the availability of water to the property the Fletchers purchased;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>was Appellees’ First Amended Original Answer and Original Counter-Claim for\r\nDeclaratory Judgment filed and served in time to become part of the summary\r\njudgment record;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>does Appellees’ summary judgment motion identify the elements of the Fletchers’\r\ncauses of action for which they claim there is no-evidence;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>is reliance a necessary element for a DTPA claim under the law applicable to this\r\ncase;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>was Edwards’s alleged representation concerning availability of water so “patently\r\nabsurd” that the Fletchers should not have relied upon it;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>is there evidence that the Fletchers relied on Edwards’s alleged representation;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>for purposes of exemplary damages, is there evidence Edwards intended to deceive\r\nthe Fletchers when he made the alleged representations; and</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>is the “Acceptance of Title” agreement properly included in the summary judgment\r\nrecord because Appellees did not produce it to the Fletchers in discovery.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>BACKGROUND</span></span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>On June 4, 1991, Edwards, a real estate agent for ERA, showed the Fletchers a lot that\r\nwas listed with ERA.  That same day, the Fletchers signed a real estate contract with the\r\nowner of the lot, Donald Wallace, to purchase it for $16,000 cash.  In this contract, they\r\nobligated themselves to “accept[ ] the Property in its present condition.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The parties dispute whether Edwards affirmatively represented to them that water was\r\navailable to the lot.  The Fletchers maintain that before they purchased the lot, they asked\r\nEdwards whether water was available to the lot.  The Fletchers claim that Edwards told them\r\nthat water service was available but that it was disconnected because the water bill had not\r\nbeen paid.  The Fletchers further claim that Edwards told them that water service could be re-established if they paid the Johnson County Rural Water Supply Corporation (the “Water\r\nCompany”) $1,400.  However, Edwards maintains that he never told the Fletchers that water\r\nservice was available to the lot and that he told the Fletchers that they needed to check with the\r\nWater Company and be certain that they could obtain a water meter for the lot before they\r\npurchased the lot.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers signed an “Acceptance of Title” agreement at closing on June 5 which\r\ncontains an “as is” clause.  After their purchase, the Fletchers contacted the Water Company\r\nto have water service restored to their lot.  The Water Company told the Fletchers that water\r\nservice was unavailable to their lot because the adjacent lot lacked the necessary easements\r\nrequired for water service.  Specifically, the Water Company informed the Fletchers that the\r\nwater meter for their lot must be located on the adjacent lot before water service could begin. \r\nThe Water Company stated that without an easement on the adjacent lot, they cannot service\r\nthe Fletchers’ lot.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers subsequently filed suit against Edwards, Beverly Sanborn, Orr, ERA,\r\nClarence C. Davis, the Water Company, and Wallace</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> claiming:  (1) statutory and common\r\nlaw fraudulent inducement; (2) violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“DTPA”);</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> and\r\n(3) negligent misrepresentation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Appellees each originally responded to the Fletchers’ lawsuit with general denials.  On\r\nMay 19, 1998, Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment raising both traditional\r\nsummary judgment claims and a “no-evidence” claim.  <i>See Williams v. Bank One</i>, No. 10-99-077-CV, slip op. at 12-13, 1999 WL 1123813, at *7 (Tex. App.—Waco Dec. 8, 1999, no\r\npet.); <i>Grant v. Southwestern Elec. Power Co.</i>, 998 S.W.2d 383, 387-88 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Texarkana 1999, no pet. h.); <span>Tex. R. Civ. P. </span>166a(c), (i).  Although these claims are\r\nnot as distinctly segregated as the Court would prefer, a close reading of paragraph 4 of the\r\nmotion discloses that Appellees argue under their traditional summary judgment claim that they\r\nare entitled to judgment as a matter of law because:  (1) the “as is” clauses</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> bar the Fletchers’\r\nclaims; (2) the “as is” clauses establish that the Fletchers did not rely on any alleged\r\nmisrepresentations; and (3) Appellees had no duty as Wallace’s agents “to investigate the\r\nactual condition or status of the water line, water easement or water meter.”  Under the no-evidence portion of their motion, they claim the Fletchers can produce no evidence that\r\nEdwards knew his alleged statements concerning the availability of water were false.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In support of their dual motion Appellees attached excerpts of Edwards’s deposition\r\ntestimony in which Edwards claimed that:  (1) he did not make any affirmative representations\r\nto the Fletchers that water was available to the lot; (2) he told prospective buyers that it was\r\ntheir job to check with the Water Company and that he told the Fletchers the same; (3) he did\r\nnot actually know whether water was available to the lot; and (4) if he did make any\r\nrepresentations to the Fletchers, it was because he believed that water was available because\r\nWallace, the prior owner, told him that water was available, the lot previously had a septic\r\ntank on it, he saw a water hydrant on the property, and a mobile home had been on the lot for\r\nseveral years.  The court set the matter for hearing on June 9.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers filed their response on June 1.  They contest whether Edwards told them\r\nthey would need to consult with the Water Company to determine the availability of a water\r\nconnection on their property and claim that he told them a water membership would cost\r\n$1,400.  They challenge Appellees’ use of the “as is” clauses by asserting that such clauses are\r\nnot applicable in DTPA cases.  They assert that Edwards had a duty to them to insure that his\r\nalleged representation was true.  They argue that Edwards’s alleged representation was false\r\nand material and induced them to enter into the real estate contract.  The Fletchers supported\r\ntheir response with an affidavit from D’Ann Fletcher stating that Edwards told her and her\r\nhusband on three separate occasions that utilities were available to the lot and that Edwards did\r\nnot tell her husband to check with the Water Company before they purchased the lot.  They\r\nobjected to two paragraphs in Edwards’s summary judgment affidavit on hearsay grounds.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Two days later, Appellees filed a First Amended Original Answer and Original\r\nCounterclaim for Declaratory Judgment.  The amended answer contains special exceptions to\r\nportions of the Fletchers’ Fourth Amended Original Petition (filed in 1993) and generally\r\ndenies the allegations of the petition.  The counterclaim asserts that the Fletchers obtained from\r\nadjoining landowners the easements necessary to facilitate water service on March 18, 1998. \r\nThe Fletchers filed a Motion to Strike this pleading on June 8, because it was filed within\r\nseven days of the date of the summary judgment hearing.  They also objected to Appellees’\r\nreliance on the March 18 easement conveyance because Appellees failed to produce a copy of\r\nit in their discovery responses.  Appellees non-suited their counterclaim two months after filing\r\nit.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>On June 26, Appellees filed a supplement to their summary judgment motion.  They\r\nattached excerpts from D’Ann Fletcher’s June 1 deposition.  Appellees contemporaneously\r\nfiled a motion to supplement the summary judgment record.  They also filed a brief in support\r\nof their motion for summary judgment (as supplemented) on that date.  The Fletchers filed a\r\nsupplemental response on the same date, raising additional legal arguments in response to the\r\noriginal motion. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The trial court signed an order on July 1 granting Appellees’ motion to supplement the\r\nrecord and a separate order on that same date granting their summary judgment motion.  The\r\ncourt did not specify the ground(s) on which it was granting summary judgment, nor did it\r\naddress any of the Fletchers’ summary judgment objections, their Motion to Strike, or their\r\nsupplemental response.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The next day, the Fletchers filed a motion asking the court to permit supplementation of\r\nthe summary judgment record with the supplemental response they had filed on June 26.  The\r\ncourt signed an order on that same date granting the motion.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the movant must demonstrate that there are no\r\ngenuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  <i>American\r\nTobacco Co. v. Grinnell</i>, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. 1997).  We disregard all conflicts in the\r\nevidence and accept the evidence favoring the nonmovant as true.  <i>Great Am. Reserve Ins. Co.\r\nv. San Antonio Plumbing Supply Co.</i>, 391 S.W.2d 41, 47 (Tex. 1965); <i>Kehler v. Eudaly</i>, 933\r\nS.W.2d 321, 324 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, writ denied).  We indulge every reasonable\r\ninference from the evidence in favor of the nonmovant and resolve any doubts in its favor. \r\n<i>American Tobacco</i>, 951 S.W.2d at 425.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A trial court cannot grant summary judgment on a ground not expressly presented in the\r\nsummary judgment motion.  <i>Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v. Cates</i>, 927 S.W.2d 623, 625 (Tex.\r\n1996).  Similarly, “[t]he non-movant must expressly present to the trial court, by written\r\nanswer or response, any issues defeating the movant’s entitlement [to summary judgment].” \r\n<i>McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist.</i>, 858 S.W.2d 337, 343 (Tex. 1993) (citing <i>City of\r\nHouston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth.</i>, 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex. 1979)).  Grounds raised by\r\neither party in a brief filed in support of the motion or response, but not in the motion or\r\nresponse itself, are not to be considered by the trial court.  <i>Id.</i> at 340-41.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>“When the trial court does not specify the basis for its summary judgment, the appealing\r\nparty must show it is error to base it on any ground asserted in the motion.”  <i>Star-Telegram,\r\nInc. v. Doe</i>, 915 S.W.2d 471, 473 (Tex. 1995).  We consider only those grounds “the movant\r\nactually presented to the trial court” in the motion.  <i>Cincinnati Life Ins.</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 625. \r\nWe do not consider grounds the non-movant failed to expressly present to the trial court in a\r\nwritten response.  <i>McConnell</i>, 858 S.W.2d at 343; <span>Tex.

Accordingly, we conclude that they have failed\r\nto preserve for appellate review their complaint that the pleading was filed within seven days\r\nof the summary judgment hearing.  <i>See id.</i>  Therefore, we overrule their fourth issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers’ filed a brief the day before the summary judgment hearing in which they\r\nraised objections to documents produced by Appellees in supplemental discovery responses. \r\nThese objections appear to go to Appellees’ late production of the easements which the\r\nFletchers obtained in March 1998 to permit a water connection.  The objections stated in the\r\nFletchers’ brief do not identify the “Acceptance of Title” agreement as a late-disclosed\r\ndocument, and the record does not reflect that the court ruled on their objections. \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that they have failed to preserve this issue for our review.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.\r\nR.

In the earnest money contract, the Fletchers contractually bound themselves to accept\r\nthe property “in its present condition.”  We construe this to be an agreement to purchase the\r\nproperty “as is.”  <i>See Smith v. Levine</i>, 911 S.W.2d 427, 431 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1995,\r\nwrit denied).  In the “Acceptance of Title” agreement, the Fletchers expressly acknowledged\r\nthat “they accept[ed] the property in its ‘AS IS’ conditions [sic]” and:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>that neither the Seller, Real Estate Agents or Brokers, or BURLESON LAND &amp;\r\nTITLE COMPANY, TRW TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY, OR ALAMO TITLE\r\nINSURANCE COMPANY OF TEXAS have made any warranties or representations\r\nas [sic] the condition of the above-referenced property, and accordingly, the\r\nundersigned Purchasers release and hold them harmless from any and all liability in\r\nregard to the same.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Generally, an “as is” agreement negates the causation essential to recovery for a DTPA\r\nviolation,</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> fraud, and negligence.  <i>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Jefferson Assocs.</i>, 896\r\nS.W.2d 156, 161-62 (Tex. 1995).  However, such an agreement will not bind a buyer who is\r\ninduced to enter the agreement because of a fraudulent representation.  <i>Id.</i> at 162.  The parties\r\ncan contract away this fraudulent inducement exception if the agreement “clearly expresses the\r\nparties’ intent to waive fraudulent inducement claims or   .   .   .   disclaims reliance on\r\nrepresentations about specific matters in dispute.”  <i>Schlumberger Technology Corp v.\r\nSwanson</i>, 959 S.W.2d 171, 181 (Tex. 1997).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The agent of a party to an “as is” agreement may rely on the agreement in defense of\r\nclaims asserted against the agent by the other party to the agreement because the agent’s\r\nprincipal “obviously included in the agreement contract terms intended to benefit its agent.”  <i>C\r\n&amp; A Invs., Inc. v.

The Fletchers signed a contract\r\nwith Wallace agreeing to buy the property “in its present condition.”  They and Wallace signed\r\na second agreement in which they declared unequivocally that “they accept[ed] the property in\r\nits ‘AS IS’ conditions [sic]” and that none of the Appellees “made any warranties or\r\nrepresentations as [sic] the condition of the above-referenced property.”  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Appellees, as Wallace’s agents, may rely on these agreements.  <i>Id.</i>  Such agreements\r\ngenerally will negate the causation elements of the types of claims asserted by the Fletchers. \r\n<i>Prudential Ins.</i>, 896 S.W.2d at 161-62.  However, the Fletchers allege that they were\r\nfraudulently induced to enter the agreement by Edwards’s alleged misrepresentations.  If they\r\nwere so induced, then the agreement would not be binding on them or preclude them from\r\nrecovery.  <i>Id.</i> at 162; <i>SMB Partners, Ltd. v. Osloub</i>, 4 S.W.3d 368, 371 (Tex.

We\r\ndisagree.  The Fletchers allege in their petition that Edwards made the representations to\r\ninduce them “to enter into the real estate contract.”  Their contract itself states that they\r\naccepted the property “in its present condition” (<i>i.e.</i>, “as is”).  <i>See Smith</i>, 911 S.W.2d at 431. \r\nIf the Fletchers were fraudulently induced to enter the real estate contract as they allege, that\r\nfraud vitiates all documents which the Fletchers executed as a part of the transaction.  <i>See\r\nPrudential Ins.</i>, 896 S.W.2d at 162 (court must consider the “nature of the transaction and the\r\ntotality of the circumstances surrounding the agreement” to determine whether an “as is”\r\nagreement is enforceable); <i>see also ECC Parkway Joint Venture v.

The Fletchers’ only response to this assertion in their summary\r\njudgment pleadings is: “Whether [Edwards] knew or not is not the question.”  We construe\r\nthis response to be a statement that knowledge is immaterial under section 27.01.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers are correct that under section 27.01, knowledge is immaterial to the\r\nrecovery of actual damages.  <i>Brush</i>, 984 S.W.2d at 726; <i>Diversified</i>, 702 S.W.2d at 723. \r\nUnder the common law however, the Fletchers must establish either that Edwards knew the\r\nalleged representations were false or that he recklessly made them as positive assertions\r\nwithout knowledge of the truth.  <i>Insurance Co. of N. Am.</i>, 981 S.W.2d at 674; <i>Brush</i>, 984\r\nS.W.2d at 726.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Appellees aver in their no-evidence summary judgment motion that Edwards did not know\r\nthe alleged representations were false.  The Fletchers presented no summary judgment\r\nevidence to counter this assertion.  Ordinarily in this situation, the trial court has no discretion\r\nbut to grant the no-evidence motion.  <i>See Williams</i>, slip op. at 13, 1999 WL 1123813, at *7;\r\n<span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 166a(i).  In this case however, the question of knowledge does not wholly\r\ndispose of the Fletchers’ common law fraud claim.  The Fletchers may also prevail if they\r\nshow that Edwards recklessly made the alleged representations as positive assertions without\r\nknowledge of the truth.  <i>Insurance Co. of N.

We have\r\nalready concluded that these clauses do not entitle them to a summary judgment because of the\r\nFletchers’ fraudulent inducement claims.  Thus, Appellees failed to establish an entitlement to\r\njudgment as a matter of law on the recklessness element of the Fletchers’ common law\r\nfraudulent inducement claim.  <i>See Clear Creek Basin Auth.</i>, 589 S.W.2d at 679.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Similarly, the no-evidence portion of Appellees’ summary judgment motion challenges\r\nonly the knowledge element of the Fletchers’ common law claim.  Accordingly, Appellees\r\nfailed to allege or demonstrate that no evidence exists to support the recklessness element of\r\nthe Fletchers’ common law fraudulent inducement claim.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 166a(i).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>RELIANCE</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers contend in their eighth issue that a fact issue exists on the question of\r\nwhether they relied on Edwards’s alleged representations.  Appellees rely on the “as is”\r\nclauses to assert that the Fletchers “are precluded as a matter of law from recovering under\r\ntheir common law fraud [or] statutory fraud   .   .   .   claims.”  As stated above however, an\r\n“as is” clause will not bar a fraudulent inducement claim unless it “clearly expresses the\r\nparties’ intent to waive fraudulent inducement claims or   .   .   .   disclaims reliance on\r\nrepresentations about specific matters in dispute.”  <i>Schlumberger Technology</i>, 959 S.W.2d at\r\n181.  We have already determined that the “as is” provisions in this case do not meet either of\r\nthe requirements stated in <i>Schlumberger Technology</i>.  Thus, these provisions do not preclude\r\nthe Fletchers from pursuing their fraudulent inducement claims.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers assert in their summary judgment response that they relied on Edwards’s\r\nrepresentations.  D’Ann Fletcher’s affidavit recites that Edwards was asked three times\r\nwhether utilities were available to the property.  Resolving all inferences in favor of the non-movants, we conclude that Appellees failed to establish as a matter of law that the Fletchers did\r\nnot rely on Edwards’s alleged representations.  <i>See American Tobacco</i>, 951 S.W.2d at 425. \r\nAccordingly, we sustain the Fletchers’ eighth issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Because fact issues remain on the issue of reliance, we need not address the Fletchers’\r\nseventh issue regarding the “patent absurdity” of Edwards’s alleged representations. \r\nAppellees have failed to establish their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on any\r\nelement of the Fletchers’ common law and statutory fraudulent inducement claims.  <i>See Clear\r\nCreek Basin Auth.</i>, 589 S.W.2d at 679.  Appellees similarly failed to allege or establish that no\r\nevidence exists to support the recklessness element of the Fletchers’ common law claim.  <i>See</i>\r\n<span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 166a(i).  Therefore, the trial court erred in granting them a summary\r\njudgment on these claims.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>EXEMPLARY DAMAGES</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers question in their ninth issue whether the summary judgment evidence raises\r\na fact issue on the question of whether Edwards intended to deceive them when he made the\r\nalleged representations.  Section 27.01(c) provides for the recovery of exemplary damages in\r\ncases where the declarant makes a representation “with actual awareness” of its falsity.  <span>Tex.\r\nBus. &amp; Com. Code Ann.</span> § 27.01(c) (Vernon 1987).  For common law fraud, the Fletchers\r\nmust establish that Edwards acted with malice</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> to recover exemplary damages.  <i>LaChalet\r\nInt’l, Inc. v. Nowik</i>, 787 S.W.2d 101, 106 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, no writ); <i>Gardner v.\r\nKerly</i>, 613 S.W.2d 795, 796 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1981, no writ).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In the Fletchers’ summary judgment response, they argue only that the question of\r\nEdwards’s knowledge is irrelevant to their recovery of actual damages under section 27.01. \r\nThey did not otherwise present evidence or argument to the trial court to challenge Appellees’\r\nassertion that there is no evidence Edwards knew his alleged representations were false.  Thus,\r\nwe do not consider these arguments.  <i>See McConnell</i>, 858 S.W.2d at 343.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Because the Fletchers presented no evidence or argument to counter Appellees’ contention\r\nthat there is no evidence Edwards knew his alleged representations were false, the trial court\r\nhad no discretion but to grant Appellees’ motion on the issue of exemplary damages.  <i>See</i>\r\n<i>Williams</i>, slip op. at 13, 1999 WL 1123813, at *7; <span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 166a(i).  Accordingly, we\r\noverrule the Fletchers’ ninth issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABIITY</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers question in their third issue whether Orr and ERA are jointly and severally\r\nliable for Edwards’s alleged representations.  <i>See, e.g., NationsBank, N.A. v. Dilling</i>, 922\r\nS.W.2d 950, 952-53 (Tex. 1996); <i>Roberts v. Tipton</i>, 562 S.W.2d 921, 922 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.—Waco 1978, writ ref’d n.r.e.).  Appellees respond only that because they believe “the\r\nFletchers failed to raise genuine issues of material fact on their claims against Edwards, issues\r\nof vicarious liability against Orr and ERA   .   .   .   are moot.”  Orr and ERA did not allege\r\nan entitlement to judgment on this ground in their summary judgment motion.  Thus, the trial\r\ncourt could not have granted them a summary judgment on this ground, and we cannot\r\nconsider it on appeal.  <i>See Cincinnati Life Ins.</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 625.  Accordingly, we will not\r\nfurther address the Fletchers’ third issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>CONCLUSION</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers allege that they were fraudulently induced to enter the transaction with\r\nAppellees.  If so, the “as is” clauses at issue would not be binding on them or preclude them\r\nfrom recovering on any of their claims.  However, Appellees demonstrated that they are\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Fletchers’ claim for exemplary damages under\r\nsection 27.01(c) and the common law.  Otherwise, Appellees failed to establish their\r\nentitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the Fletchers’ claims.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We affirm the portion of the summary judgment granted on the Fletchers’ claims for\r\nexemplary damages under section 27.01(c) and the common law.

Edwards, Rob Orr, ERA Orr &amp;\r\nAssociates (collectively, “Appellees”) and others alleging statutory and common law\r\nfraudulent inducement, DTPA violations, and negligent misrepresentation.  The Fletchers\r\nallege that Edwards, a real estate agent, represented to them that they could get a water\r\nconnection to a lot which they ultimately purchased, when in fact they could not obtain the\r\nnecessary connection because of a lack of easements across an adjoining lot.  The court granted\r\na summary judgment in Appellees’ favor.  The Fletchers present the following ten issues in\r\nthis appeal:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>were the “as is” clauses in the documents they signed with the seller Donald L.\r\nWallace a part of the bargain between Wallace and themselves;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>if so, did these clauses “survive the June 5, 1991 closing at the title company”;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>are Orr and ERA jointly and severally liable for Edwards’s alleged representations\r\nconcerning the availability of water to the property the Fletchers purchased;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>was Appellees’ First Amended Original Answer and Original Counter-Claim for\r\nDeclaratory Judgment filed and served in time to become part of the summary\r\njudgment record;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>does Appellees’ summary judgment motion identify the elements of the Fletchers’\r\ncauses of action for which they claim there is no-evidence;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>is reliance a necessary element for a DTPA claim under the law applicable to this\r\ncase;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>was Edwards’s alleged representation concerning availability of water so “patently\r\nabsurd” that the Fletchers should not have relied upon it;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>is there evidence that the Fletchers relied on Edwards’s alleged representation;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>for purposes of exemplary damages, is there evidence Edwards intended to deceive\r\nthe Fletchers when he made the alleged representations; and</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>•<span>    </span>is the “Acceptance of Title” agreement properly included in the summary judgment\r\nrecord because Appellees did not produce it to the Fletchers in discovery.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>BACKGROUND</span></span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>On June 4, 1991, Edwards, a real estate agent for ERA, showed the Fletchers a lot that\r\nwas listed with ERA.  That same day, the Fletchers signed a real estate contract with the\r\nowner of the lot, Donald Wallace, to purchase it for $16,000 cash.  In this contract, they\r\nobligated themselves to “accept[ ] the Property in its present condition.”</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The parties dispute whether Edwards affirmatively represented to them that water was\r\navailable to the lot.  The Fletchers maintain that before they purchased the lot, they asked\r\nEdwards whether water was available to the lot.  The Fletchers claim that Edwards told them\r\nthat water service was available but that it was disconnected because the water bill had not\r\nbeen paid.  The Fletchers further claim that Edwards told them that water service could be re-established if they paid the Johnson County Rural Water Supply Corporation (the “Water\r\nCompany”) $1,400.  However, Edwards maintains that he never told the Fletchers that water\r\nservice was available to the lot and that he told the Fletchers that they needed to check with the\r\nWater Company and be certain that they could obtain a water meter for the lot before they\r\npurchased the lot.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers signed an “Acceptance of Title” agreement at closing on June 5 which\r\ncontains an “as is” clause.  After their purchase, the Fletchers contacted the Water Company\r\nto have water service restored to their lot.  The Water Company told the Fletchers that water\r\nservice was unavailable to their lot because the adjacent lot lacked the necessary easements\r\nrequired for water service.  Specifically, the Water Company informed the Fletchers that the\r\nwater meter for their lot must be located on the adjacent lot before water service could begin. \r\nThe Water Company stated that without an easement on the adjacent lot, they cannot service\r\nthe Fletchers’ lot.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers subsequently filed suit against Edwards, Beverly Sanborn, Orr, ERA,\r\nClarence C. Davis, the Water Company, and Wallace</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> claiming:  (1) statutory and common\r\nlaw fraudulent inducement; (2) violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“DTPA”);</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> and\r\n(3) negligent misrepresentation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Appellees each originally responded to the Fletchers’ lawsuit with general denials.  On\r\nMay 19, 1998, Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment raising both traditional\r\nsummary judgment claims and a “no-evidence” claim.  <i>See Williams v. Bank One</i>, No. 10-99-077-CV, slip op. at 12-13, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1123813</span></span>, at *7 (Tex.

R. Civ. P. </span>166a(c), (i).  Although these claims are\r\nnot as distinctly segregated as the Court would prefer, a close reading of paragraph 4 of the\r\nmotion discloses that Appellees argue under their traditional summary judgment claim that they\r\nare entitled to judgment as a matter of law because:  (1) the “as is” clauses</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> bar the Fletchers’\r\nclaims; (2) the “as is” clauses establish that the Fletchers did not rely on any alleged\r\nmisrepresentations; and (3) Appellees had no duty as Wallace’s agents “to investigate the\r\nactual condition or status of the water line, water easement or water meter.”  Under the no-evidence portion of their motion, they claim the Fletchers can produce no evidence that\r\nEdwards knew his alleged statements concerning the availability of water were false.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In support of their dual motion Appellees attached excerpts of Edwards’s deposition\r\ntestimony in which Edwards claimed that:  (1) he did not make any affirmative representations\r\nto the Fletchers that water was available to the lot; (2) he told prospective buyers that it was\r\ntheir job to check with the Water Company and that he told the Fletchers the same; (3) he did\r\nnot actually know whether water was available to the lot; and (4) if he did make any\r\nrepresentations to the Fletchers, it was because he believed that water was available because\r\nWallace, the prior owner, told him that water was available, the lot previously had a septic\r\ntank on it, he saw a water hydrant on the property, and a mobile home had been on the lot for\r\nseveral years.  The court set the matter for hearing on June 9.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers filed their response on June 1.  They contest whether Edwards told them\r\nthey would need to consult with the Water Company to determine the availability of a water\r\nconnection on their property and claim that he told them a water membership would cost\r\n$1,400.  They challenge Appellees’ use of the “as is” clauses by asserting that such clauses are\r\nnot applicable in DTPA cases.  They assert that Edwards had a duty to them to insure that his\r\nalleged representation was true.  They argue that Edwards’s alleged representation was false\r\nand material and induced them to enter into the real estate contract.  The Fletchers supported\r\ntheir response with an affidavit from D’Ann Fletcher stating that Edwards told her and her\r\nhusband on three separate occasions that utilities were available to the lot and that Edwards did\r\nnot tell her husband to check with the Water Company before they purchased the lot.  They\r\nobjected to two paragraphs in Edwards’s summary judgment affidavit on hearsay grounds.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Two days later, Appellees filed a First Amended Original Answer and Original\r\nCounterclaim for Declaratory Judgment.  The amended answer contains special exceptions to\r\nportions of the Fletchers’ Fourth Amended Original Petition (filed in 1993) and generally\r\ndenies the allegations of the petition.  The counterclaim asserts that the Fletchers obtained from\r\nadjoining landowners the easements necessary to facilitate water service on March 18, 1998. \r\nThe Fletchers filed a Motion to Strike this pleading on June 8, because it was filed within\r\nseven days of the date of the summary judgment hearing.  They also objected to Appellees’\r\nreliance on the March 18 easement conveyance because Appellees failed to produce a copy of\r\nit in their discovery responses.  Appellees non-suited their counterclaim two months after filing\r\nit.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>On June 26, Appellees filed a supplement to their summary judgment motion.  They\r\nattached excerpts from D’Ann Fletcher’s June 1 deposition.  Appellees contemporaneously\r\nfiled a motion to supplement the summary judgment record.  They also filed a brief in support\r\nof their motion for summary judgment (as supplemented) on that date.  The Fletchers filed a\r\nsupplemental response on the same date, raising additional legal arguments in response to the\r\noriginal motion. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The trial court signed an order on July 1 granting Appellees’ motion to supplement the\r\nrecord and a separate order on that same date granting their summary judgment motion.  The\r\ncourt did not specify the ground(s) on which it was granting summary judgment, nor did it\r\naddress any of the Fletchers’ summary judgment objections, their Motion to Strike, or their\r\nsupplemental response.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The next day, the Fletchers filed a motion asking the court to permit supplementation of\r\nthe summary judgment record with the supplemental response they had filed on June 26.  The\r\ncourt signed an order on that same date granting the motion.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>To prevail on a summary judgment motion, the movant must demonstrate that there are no\r\ngenuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  <i>American\r\nTobacco Co. v.

We have\r\nalready concluded that these clauses do not entitle them to a summary judgment because of the\r\nFletchers’ fraudulent inducement claims.  Thus, Appellees failed to establish an entitlement to\r\njudgment as a matter of law on the recklessness element of the Fletchers’ common law\r\nfraudulent inducement claim.  <i>See Clear Creek Basin Auth.</i>, 589 S.W.2d at 679.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Similarly, the no-evidence portion of Appellees’ summary judgment motion challenges\r\nonly the knowledge element of the Fletchers’ common law claim.

Appellees rely on the “as is”\r\nclauses to assert that the Fletchers “are precluded as a matter of law from recovering under\r\ntheir common law fraud [or] statutory fraud   .   .   .   claims.”  As stated above however, an\r\n“as is” clause will not bar a fraudulent inducement claim unless it “clearly expresses the\r\nparties’ intent to waive fraudulent inducement claims or   .   .   .   disclaims reliance on\r\nrepresentations about specific matters in dispute.”  <i>Schlumberger Technology</i>, 959 S.W.2d at\r\n181.  We have already determined that the “as is” provisions in this case do not meet either of\r\nthe requirements stated in <i>Schlumberger Technology</i>.  Thus, these provisions do not preclude\r\nthe Fletchers from pursuing their fraudulent inducement claims.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers assert in their summary judgment response that they relied on Edwards’s\r\nrepresentations.  D’Ann Fletcher’s affidavit recites that Edwards was asked three times\r\nwhether utilities were available to the property.  Resolving all inferences in favor of the non-movants, we conclude that Appellees failed to establish as a matter of law that the Fletchers did\r\nnot rely on Edwards’s alleged representations.  <i>See American Tobacco</i>, 951 S.W.2d at 425. \r\nAccordingly, we sustain the Fletchers’ eighth issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Because fact issues remain on the issue of reliance, we need not address the Fletchers’\r\nseventh issue regarding the “patent absurdity” of Edwards’s alleged representations. \r\nAppellees have failed to establish their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on any\r\nelement of the Fletchers’ common law and statutory fraudulent inducement claims.  <i>See Clear\r\nCreek Basin Auth.</i>, 589 S.W.2d at 679.  Appellees similarly failed to allege or establish that no\r\nevidence exists to support the recklessness element of the Fletchers’ common law claim.  <i>See</i>\r\n<span>Tex. R. Civ.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1981, no writ).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In the Fletchers’ summary judgment response, they argue only that the question of\r\nEdwards’s knowledge is irrelevant to their recovery of actual damages under section 27.01. \r\nThey did not otherwise present evidence or argument to the trial court to challenge Appellees’\r\nassertion that there is no evidence Edwards knew his alleged representations were false.  Thus,\r\nwe do not consider these arguments.  <i>See McConnell</i>, 858 S.W.2d at 343.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Because the Fletchers presented no evidence or argument to counter Appellees’ contention\r\nthat there is no evidence Edwards knew his alleged representations were false, the trial court\r\nhad no discretion but to grant Appellees’ motion on the issue of exemplary damages.  <i>See</i>\r\n<i>Williams</i>, slip op. at 13, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1123813</span></span>, at *7; <span>Tex.

Accordingly, we\r\noverrule the Fletchers’ ninth issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABIITY</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers question in their third issue whether Orr and ERA are jointly and severally\r\nliable for Edwards’s alleged representations.  <i>See, e.g., NationsBank, N.A. v. Dilling</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462703\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462703/nationsbank-na-v-dilling/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span>, 952-53 (Tex. 1996); <i>Roberts v. Tipton</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2457435\"><a href=\"/opinion/2457435/roberts-v-tipton/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span>, 922 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.—Waco 1978, writ ref’d n.r.e.).  Appellees respond only that because they believe “the\r\nFletchers failed to raise genuine issues of material fact on their claims against Edwards, issues\r\nof vicarious liability against Orr and ERA   .   .   .   are moot.”  Orr and ERA did not allege\r\nan entitlement to judgment on this ground in their summary judgment motion.  Thus, the trial\r\ncourt could not have granted them a summary judgment on this ground, and we cannot\r\nconsider it on appeal.  <i>See Cincinnati Life Ins.</i>, 927 S.W.2d at 625.  Accordingly, we will not\r\nfurther address the Fletchers’ third issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>CONCLUSION</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Fletchers allege that they were fraudulently induced to enter the transaction with\r\nAppellees.  If so, the “as is” clauses at issue would not be binding on them or preclude them\r\nfrom recovering on any of their claims.  However, Appellees demonstrated that they are\r\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Fletchers’ claim for exemplary damages under\r\nsection 27.01(c) and the common law.  Otherwise, Appellees failed to establish their\r\nentitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the Fletchers’ claims.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We affirm the portion of the summary judgment granted on the Fletchers’ claims for\r\nexemplary damages under section 27.01(c) and the common law.  We reverse the portion of\r\nthe summary judgment granted on the remainder of their claims, sever, and remand that\r\nportion of this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  <i>See\r\nAero Energy, Inc. v.
