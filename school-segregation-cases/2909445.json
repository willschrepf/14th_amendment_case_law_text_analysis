We also emphasize\n    that the district court should look at the offerings as\n    a whole and in their entirety and thus the court is not\n\f5570             PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n    required to ensure that each individual program or\n    service offered at Theo Lacy and Musick is offered\n    in complete parity with an offering at the Central\n    Jail.\n\n  (2) At 519 F.3d at 1016, delete the sentence reading, “In\nparticular, the district court should examine the extent to\nwhich the programs offered at Theo Lacy and Musick are\ncapable of reassignment to the Central Jail without eliminat-\ning those programs at Theo Lacy or Musick.” Replace the\ndeleted sentence with the following three sentences:\n\n    In particular, the district court should examine the\n    feasibility of offering similar programs at the Central\n    Jail, and the extent to which the programs offered at\n    Theo Lacy or Musick are capable of being offered at\n    the Central Jail without eliminating those programs\n    at Theo Lacy or Musick. There may be other appro-\n    priate remedies that provide disabled inmates access\n    to programs and services, and the district court\n    should consider those options as well. Our intention\n    is not to suggest or cause the termination or diminu-\n    tion of programs or facilities other than the Central\n    Jail, but to have the district court explore available\n    options on a full evidentiary record.\n\n   Judges McKeown and Bybee have voted to deny the peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc, and Judge Fletcher has so recom-\nmended. The petition for en banc rehearing has been\ncirculated to the full court, and no judge has requested a vote\non whether to rehear the matter en banc. Fed. R. App. P.\n35(b). The petition for rehearing en banc is denied. No further\npetitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc will be accepted.\n\n  IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\f                    PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                      5571\n                              OPINION\n\nB. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   In 2001, plaintiffs-appellants Fred Pierce, Timothy Lee\nConn, Fermin Valenzuela, and Laurie D. Ellerston—pretrial\ndetainees in Orange County’s jail facilities—initiated Pierce\nv. County of Orange, No. 05-55829 (D. Ct. No. 01-981), a\nclass action suit against the County of Orange and Michael S.\nCarona, the county’s sheriff and agent.1 Seeking relief under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process rights, plaintiffs contend, in essence, that\nthe Orange County jails are operated in an unconstitutional\nmanner, depriving them of opportunities for exercise, unduly\nlimiting their access to common areas, and impermissibly\nrestricting their ability to practice religion. Plaintiffs further\nassert that they have been deprived of a number of the federal\nrights previously recognized in Stewart v. Gates, 450 F. Supp.\n583 (C.D. Cal. 1978) (“Stewart”)—a decision and resulting\ninjunctive orders (“the Stewart orders” or “the Stewart injunc-\ntion”) that established standards for pretrial detention in\nOrange County jails. The plaintiffs seek relief for the same\ninjuries under the California Constitution, as well as Title 15\nof the California Code of Regulations (which sets minimum\nstandards for county jails) in violation of § 815.6 of the Cali-\nfornia Government Code, and breach of § 54.1 of the Califor-\nnia Civil Code. Finally, the plaintiffs in Pierce assert an equal\nprotection claim under § 1983 based on the denial of equal\ntreatment to disabled detainees, and they advance a separate\nclaim for violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabili-\nties Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., alleging non-\ncompliant jail facilities and denial of access to programs and\nservices available to non-disabled detainees. On appeal, the\n  1\n   Plaintiffs’ claims against Carona were dismissed, leaving the County\nas the sole defendant-appellee involved in this consolidated appeal. In a\nseparate order, we grant Carona’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ appeal\nas untimely with respect to him.\n\f5572               PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nplaintiffs also challenge a number of the district court’s pre-\ntrial procedural and evidentiary rulings.\n\n   After a six day trial, the district court found that the plain-\ntiffs had failed to establish any constitutional injury giving\nrise to relief under § 1983. The district court went on to find\nthat the fourteen Stewart orders at issue were no longer neces-\nsary, and ordered them all terminated pursuant to the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (“PLRA”),2 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).\nThe district court likewise rejected plaintiffs’ equal protection\nand ADA claims, finding that although the County was not in\n“full ADA compliance, [ ] it can reasonably be expected to\nmove toward full compliance.”\n\n   Having conducted a thorough review of the extensive pre-\ntrial and trial record, we affirm in part and reverse in part. We\naffirm the district court’s pre-trial and evidentiary rulings\nchallenged by the plaintiffs; the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in its pre-trial management of the case or its deci-\nsions related to the admission of evidence. On the merits, we\naffirm the district court’s termination of nearly all of the four-\nteen Stewart orders at issue. Two of those orders, however,\nwhich secure inmates housed in administrative segregation\nsome minimal access to religious services and exercise, may\nnot be terminated. The district court clearly erred in its find-\ning that these two orders are unnecessary to correct a current\nand ongoing violation of a Federal right. We likewise con-\nclude that, because of physical barriers that deny disabled\ninmates access to certain prison facilities (bathrooms, show-\ners, exercise and other common areas), and because of dispa-\nrate programs and services offered to disabled versus non-\ndisabled inmates, the County is in violation of the ADA.\n  2\n   Pub. L. No. 104-134, §§ 801-810, 110 Stat. 1321, 1321-66 to 1321-77\n(1996) (codified at 11 U.S.C. § 523 (2000); 18 U.S.C. §§ 3624, 3626\n(2000); 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346, 1915, 1915A, 1932 (2000); 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1997a-1997h (2000)).\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                      5573\n                   I.   PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS\n\nA.    Violation of the Stewart orders governing prison\n      conditions.\n\n   Stewart v. Gates was commenced in 1975 when a class of\npretrial detainees challenged the constitutionality of various\npractices and conditions of confinement in the Orange County\nCentral Jail in Santa Ana, California. 450 F. Supp. 583 (D.C.\nCal. 1978). In 1978, the district court presiding over the case\nissued an injunction, establishing various standards for pre-\ntrial detention. Id. at 590-91 (holding that the court retained\njurisdiction to modify the orders upon a showing of good\ncause). In 1991, the district court made clear that the order\napplied to all of the Orange County jails: Men’s Central Jail,\nWomen’s Central Jail, Intake Release Center, James A. Mus-\nick Facility, and Theo Lacy Facility.\n\n    The Stewart orders—which have been modified in the\nyears since the initial injunction was issued—address detain-\nees’ access to telephones, law books, reading materials, and\ninterjail mail to jailhouse lawyers; provide for mattresses,\nbeds, and blankets; establish mealtimes and sleeptimes;\nrequire seating while awaiting transport to and from court;\nand set population caps. The orders also address several issues\npertaining specifically to inmates in administrative segrega-\ntion: their access to religious services, day rooms, exercise,\nand visitors.3 The Stewart orders subject to challenge in this\nlitigation are reproduced as Appendix A to this opinion. Spe-\ncifically, plaintiffs in Pierce maintain that they have been sub-\n  3\n    Administrative segregation applies to inmates “who are determined to\nbe prone to: escape; assault staff or other inmates; disrupt the operations\nof the jail, or likely to need protection from other inmates.” Cal. Code\nRegs. Tit. 15, § 1053. This encompasses the definitions of both Adminis-\ntrative Segregation and Protective Custody. According to the testimony of\nCounty witness Sergeant Rich Himmel, inmates who have “violent ten-\ndencies and have been deemed a threat to Department staff or other\ninmates,” are classified as “Administrative Segregation.”\n\f5574                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\njected to holding-cell conditions deemed unconstitutional in\nStewart and have been denied the minimum mealtime held to\nbe constitutionally required in Stewart. In addition, plaintiffs\ncontend that inmates housed in administrative segregation are\ndenied the minimum access to religious services, the day\nroom, and exercise that Stewart held to be constitutionally\nrequired. Plaintiffs sought relief for the alleged violations pur-\nsuant to § 1983. Attacking the same conduct, plaintiffs also\nallege due process violations under the California Constitu-\ntion, breach of mandatory duties under Title 15 of the Califor-\nnia Code of Regulations (which sets minimum standards for\ncounty jails) in violation of § 815.6 of the California Govern-\nment Code, and breach of § 54.1 of the California Civil Code.\n\n   The County, meanwhile, sought termination of the Stewart\norders in their entirety pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b), a sec-\ntion of the PLRA that allows a court to terminate prospective\ninjunctive relief governing prison conditions on a showing\nthat the injunction is no longer needed to correct a current and\nongoing violation of a Federal right.\n\nB.     Equal protection and ADA violations.\n\n   Plaintiffs in Pierce assert an equal protection claim under\n§ 1983 based on the denial of equal treatment to disabled\ndetainees, and they advance a separate claim for violations of\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. § 12131 et seq. Plaintiffs maintain that the County has\nviolated the ADA by failing to address numerous structural\nbarriers, such as inaccessible bathroom facilities,4 and failing\nto provide adequate access to various programs offered by the\nCounty’s jails.\n\n  One of the plaintiff inmates, Timothy Conn, claimed to\nhave suffered physical injuries, as well as mental and emo-\n  4\n   The particular architectural features at issue are discussed in greater\ndetail infra Section V.D.3.a.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5575\ntional harms, because of the County’s failure to accommodate\nhis disability. Conn is wheelchair-bound and alleged that he\nsuffered recurrent bladder infections because the County\nfailed to provide him with an adequate supply of catheters.\nConn also claimed to have developed bed sores that were\nexacerbated when he was forced to sit on a holding cell\nbench, and eventually required surgery. The district court dis-\nmissed Conn’s claims on summary judgment prior to trial on\nthe grounds that they were “de minimis” and thus not action-\nable pursuant to the PLRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).\n\n                     II.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.     Class certification.\n\n   In August 2003, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certifica-\ntion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and\n23(b)(3)5 of a “main class” of pretrial detainees who had been\nheld in Orange County jails after October 21, 2001 and had\nexperienced violations of certain rights enumerated in Stew-\nart, as well as certification of a “sub-class” of disabled detain-\nees who had been denied rights under the ADA. Plaintiffs’\nmotion was granted on October 15, 2003.\n\n     In January 2004, Orange County filed a motion to decertify\n  5\n   According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), a class action\nmay be maintained when the prerequisites under subsection (a) of the rule\nare satisfied (i.e., numerosity, commonality, typicality, and representative-\nness), and “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds that generally apply to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n   If subsection (a) is satisfied, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3)\nprovides that a class action may be maintained where “the court finds that\nthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over\nany questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action\nis superior to other available methods fairly and efficiently adjudicating\nthe controversy.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n\f5576                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nthe class. The district court ruled on the motion on March 1,\n2004, holding that certification as an “equitable relief class”\nremained proper under Rule 23(b)(2), but that certification as\na “damages class” under Rule 23(b)(3) was inappropriate.\nSpecifically, the court rejected plaintiffs’ proposed proof of\n“aggregated damages” by relying on “statistical sampling to\ndetermine the proper amount of damages.” Plaintiffs’ counsel\nsubsequently waived nominal damages on behalf of the\nnamed plaintiffs. It was agreed at a status conference on\nMarch 5, 2004, that the case would proceed to a bench trial\nas an equitable relief class without claims for damages.\n\n   In November 2004, the district court clarified the scope of\nclass membership based on ADA violations. The court ruled\nthat “ADA disability evidence [would] be limited to condi-\ntions applicable to Plaintiff Conn [a wheelchair-bound named\nplaintiff] and persons having a disability similar to his.”6\n\nB.     Summary judgment on claims for mental and\n       emotional injury.\n\n   The district court’s March 1, 2004 decertification order\nseparately granted summary judgment to Orange County on\nplaintiffs’ claims for mental and emotional injuries. The dis-\ntrict court concluded that the PLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e),\nbars plaintiffs’ recovery for mental or emotional injury unless\nthere is a showing of non-de minimis physical injury. The\ncourt found that plaintiffs’ claims of relevant physical injuries\nwere all de minimis, except for one incident involving plain-\ntiff Conn not at issue here.7\n  6\n     Conn is described in the record as a paraplegic or incomplete quadri-\nplegic, meaning that he has no mobility in his lower body and some, albeit\nlimited, use of his upper body. The parties agree that the subclass consists\nof mobility- and dexterity-impaired inmates.\n   7\n     The court held that Conn could recover for mental and emotional dam-\nages arising directly from this incident—a van accident. This one claim\nwas bifurcated and ultimately settled in 2005.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                5577\nC.   Consolidation of Pierce with review of the Stewart\n     orders.\n\n   On March 11, 2004, the district court sua sponte ordered\nthat Pierce, the plaintiffs’ affirmative suit, be consolidated\nwith Stewart, over which the same district court had jurisdic-\ntion. According to the district court, the issue of the continu-\ning viability of the Stewart injunction had come up indirectly\n“in various different ways” in the Pierce litigation, and the\ncourt concluded that “rather than beat around the bush, [the\ncourt] need[ed] to just deal with these issues direct[ly].” The\ncourt explained that it would “receive evidence whether exist-\ning Stewart orders should be revised, updated, modified,\nexpanded, and/or vacated” at the trial already scheduled in\nPierce. The parties did not object to the consolidation, and\nproceeded to brief the court on the relevant developments in\nthe law in the years since Stewart was first decided.\n\nD.   Summary judgment on equal protection claims.\n\n   On November 2, 2004, the district court granted Orange\nCounty’s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ equal\nprotection claim in Pierce. The court reasoned that disabled\ndetainees were required to show that they were treated differ-\nently than other similarly situated prisoners, and had not satis-\nfied the summary judgment standard for doing so. In the same\norder, the district court also held that plaintiffs’ requests in\nPierce for injunctive relief for non-ADA-related claims (to\nredress issues of mealtimes; holding cell conditions; and\naccess to religious services, the day room, and exercise) were\nmoot, in light of the then-existing injunctions in Stewart. In\nshort, the court ruled that the question of injunctive relief for\nthe non-ADA claims in Pierce would be addressed under the\nconsolidated Stewart caption. The court held that declaratory\nrelief remained available.\n\nE.   Evidentiary and trial management rulings.\n\n   At a pretrial conference in early November 2004, the dis-\ntrict court announced that each side would be allowed three\n\f5578              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\ndays to present its case. Plaintiffs filed a written objection to\nthe time limit on due process grounds. The objection was\noverruled, and a six-day bench trial was held, with each side\nreceiving equal time. At trial, the district court adhered to its\nprior order on time limitations, advising counsel when time\nwas running short.\n\n   The district court also ruled against the plaintiffs and in the\nCounty’s favor on a number of evidentiary issues. First, the\ndistrict court barred the admission of a survey of inmates\nregarding jail conditions conducted by plaintiffs’ expert, Dr.\nNadereh Pourat (“Pourat Survey”). Second, the district court\nruled that plaintiffs could not submit deposition testimony of\nclass members who were in prisons more than 100 miles from\nthe courthouse, on the grounds that such witnesses were not\n“unavailable.” Third, the district court allowed the County to\nintroduce statements by absent class members as admissions\nby party-opponents.\n\n                             *   *    *\n\n   Trial was held during the first week of December, 2004. On\nApril 27, 2005, the district court issued two final orders—an\n“Order Vacating Earlier Orders and Dismissing Case in Stew-\nart” (“Stewart Final Order”), and “Findings of Fact and Con-\nclusions of Law in Pierce” (“Pierce Final Order”). The\nStewart Final Order vacated all of the injunctive orders in\nStewart after finding that each was either “inappropriate” or\n“unnecessary.” The Pierce Final Order also rejected in their\nentirety plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims based on prison conditions\nand practices, either on the ground that the County had not\nviolated a Federal right, or that there was no evidence of a\npolicy or custom of violations. The court also held that the\nCounty was not liable for violations of the ADA.\n\n                      III.   JURISDICTION\n\n  The district court had jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343. 28 U.S.C. § 1367 con-\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE               5579\nferred jurisdiction over state claims. We have subject matter\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n     IV.   TRIAL MANAGEMENT AND EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n   Plaintiffs appeal a number of the district court’s pre-trial\nrulings related to case management and the admission of evi-\ndence. We affirm each of the district court’s rulings on these\nissues.\n\nA.   The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n     limiting the trial to six days or by de-certifying the\n     “damages class.”\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that their due process rights were violated\nwhen they were given only three days to present their consoli-\ndated case in Pierce and Stewart. Plaintiffs in Pierce also con-\ntend that the court erred when it decertified their so-called\n“damages class.” We review both decisions for abuse of dis-\ncretion. See Navellier v. Sletten, 262 F.3d 923, 941 (9th Cir.\n2001) (challenges to trial court management and denial of\nclass certification reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n\n   [1] First, although plaintiffs assert generally that they did\nnot have adequate time to address the factual issues in Pierce\nand Stewart, we conclude that they have not shown that “there\nwas harm incurred as a result” of the time limit. Monotype\nCorp. v. Int’l Typeface Corp., 43 F.3d 443, 451 (9th Cir.\n1994). Plaintiffs objected to the time limitation but did not\nspecify what evidence they would have presented if more\ntime had been allotted, nor did they request additional time.\nSee id. (rejecting the plaintiff’s argument after noting similar\ncircumstances). Although the case was factually complex the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by limiting time for\ntrial to three days per side.\n\n  [2] Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndecertifying the “damages class.” The court reasoned that\n\f5580                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nRule 23(b)(3) would not offer a superior method for fair and\nefficient adjudication in light of expected difficulties identify-\ning class members and determining appropriate damages. It\nexplained: “Class membership here would be highly fluid and\nindefinite. Issues of damages proof would be highly individu-\nalized and poorly addressed through a sampling. There are too\nmany damages variables.”\n\n   Plaintiffs counter that the district court ignored viable ways\nof assessing the damages for the Pierce class (estimated to be\nsome 180,000 pretrial detainees), and—as a result—harbored\nundue concerns about managing the class. Plaintiffs suggest\nthat damages could be calculated by relying on records main-\ntained by the County. Yet, they concede that such records are\nincomplete, and—in fact—at various points in the trial, they\nobjected to reliance on the County’s records on the ground\nthat they were inconsistent or unreliable. Plaintiffs propose,\nalternatively, that statistical sampling could have been used to\nascertain the aggregate amount of damages suffered by the\nclass. The district court acknowledged that statistical sam-\npling may be an appropriate tool for computing damages in\nsome cases, but rejected that approach here. We conclude that\nthe district court’s decision was not an abuse of discretion\ngiven the facts of this case—in particular, the size of the class\nand the array of variables related to causation and damages.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D).8\n\nB.     The district court’s exclusion of plaintiffs’ proposed\n       evidence was either not an abuse of discretion, or it\n       did not prejudice plaintiffs.\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that three of the court’s evidentiary rul-\n  8\n    Plaintiffs’ briefs suggest that they seek only nominal damages on\nbehalf of the class and therefore do not present issues of individual dam-\nages. The remainder of plaintiffs’ argument belies this assertion, however,\nas the “aggregated damages” they describe are compensatory—not nomi-\nnal.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                 5581\nings are erroneous. First, plaintiffs challenge the district\ncourt’s decision to bar admission of the survey conducted by\nplaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Pourat. Second, plaintiffs charge that\nthe district court abused its discretion in ruling that plaintiffs\ncould not submit deposition testimony of class members who\nwere in prisons more than 100 miles from the courthouse.\nThird, plaintiffs contend that the district court committed\nreversible error when it allowed the County to introduce state-\nments by absent class members.\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s construction or inter-\npretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence, including whether\nparticular evidence falls within the scope of a given rule.\nUnited States v. Durham, 464 F.3d 976, 981 (9th Cir. 2006).\nThe district court’s ultimate evidentiary ruling to admit or\nexclude the evidence is, however, reviewed for abuse of dis-\ncretion. See id.; City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., 46\nF.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir. 1995). A district court’s decision will\nconstitute an abuse of discretion if it makes an error of law or\na clear error of fact, but “[r]eversal will not be granted unless\nprejudice is shown.” City of Long Beach, 46 F.3d at 936. If\nthe trial court has erred, we must begin with a presumption of\nprejudice, although the “presumption can be rebutted by a\nshowing that it is more probable than not that the jury would\nhave reached the same verdict even if the evidence had been\nadmitted.” Obrey v. Johnson, 400 F.3d 691, 701 (9th Cir.\n2005).\n\n  1.   Plaintiffs’ survey evidence.\n\n   Plaintiffs hired Pourat, a senior research scientist at UCLA,\nto conduct a survey of County inmates. Pourat designed a sur-\nvey questionnaire and trained law students and legal assistants\nto administer the questionnaire to detainees. Ultimately, 440\ndetainees were surveyed about their experiences in the County\njails, providing the basis for Pourat’s analysis. Without\nexplaining its rationale, the district court refused to admit the\nstudy as direct evidence, but allowed plaintiffs’ two expert\n\f5582              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nwitnesses—Dr. Patrick McManimon and Peter Robinson—to\nrely on the study in their testimony.\n\n   On appeal, the County defends the exclusion of the Pourat\nsurvey on the grounds that it did not meet the standards of\nFed. R. Evid. 807, the residual exception to the hearsay rule\nthat we have in the past relied on to admit survey evidence,\nPrudential Ins. Co. v. Gibraltar Fin. Corp., 694 F.2d 1150,\n1156 (9th Cir. 1983), and because it contends the survey evi-\ndence was not “trustworthy.” Schering Corp. v Pfizer, Inc.,\n189 F.3d 218, 231 (2d Cir. 1999) (noting that trustworthiness\nis a requirement for the admission of survey evidence).\n\n   [3] We do not need to consider the County’s justification\nof the district court’s exclusion of this evidence, however,\nbecause we are persuaded that the exclusion of the survey as\ndirect evidence did not prejudice plaintiffs in this case. Plain-\ntiffs’ experts were permitted to rely upon the Pourat Survey\nin formulating their opinions, and to share the data upon\nwhich they relied. McManimon described how the survey was\nconducted and noted its results—for example, that 35% of the\ndetainees surveyed reported that they were given less than fif-\nteen minutes per meal on at least one occasion, and that 67%\nof that group (in other words, approximately 23% of the sur-\nveyed population) reported that this occurred on at least a\nweekly basis.\n\n  2.   Deposition testimony of class members.\n\n   [4] Relying on Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(5) regard-\ning the unavailability of witnesses, plaintiffs assert that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it ruled that they\ncould not submit deposition testimony of class members who\nwere incarcerated in prisons more than one hundred miles\nfrom the courthouse. “Unavailability” may be found when the\ndeclarant “is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a\nstatement has been unable to procure the declarant’s atten-\ndance . . . by process or other reasonable means.” Fed. R.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                5583\nEvid. 804(a)(5). The district court judge refused to admit the\nproposed testimony under Rule 804 because he concluded that\nthe plaintiffs had not made an adequate attempt to procure the\nwitnesses’ attendance. He noted that the parties had been\nwarned about the “necessary administrative steps” to sub-\npoena the prisoners, and found that plaintiffs had waited too\nlong to seek the subpoenas. On appeal, plaintiffs do not con-\ntest this factual finding, and we therefore conclude that the\ndistrict court judge’s determination was not an abuse of dis-\ncretion.\n\n  3.   Statements of absent class members as “admissions of\n       a party-opponent.”\n\n   Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by admitting\nthe statements of absent—also referred to as unnamed or\nnonnamed—class members as “admissions of a party-\nopponent” under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A). Fol-\nlowing the court’s ruling, the County introduced statements\nby twenty-four absent members of the class of pretrial detain-\nees. Plaintiffs were then allowed to counter-designate testi-\nmony by those detainees under Federal Rule of Evidence 106,\nthe general rule of completeness.\n\n   For an absent member of a Rule 23(b)(2) class to be treated\nas a party—and, hence, as a party representative of the class\nas a whole—for Rule 801 purposes there must be some mech-\nanism to ensure that he or she will represent the interests of\nthe class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) (requiring that “the rep-\nresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the inter-\nests of the class”); In re Mego Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 213 F.3d\n454, 462 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding, in relevant part, that the\nnamed plaintiffs must “prosecute the action vigorously on\nbehalf of the class” to satisfy the requirement of adequate rep-\nresentation); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 41(1)(e),\ncmt. a (1980) (describing the “party” in a class action as one\nwho must “protect[ ] the interests” of the unnamed class\nmembers).\n\f5584                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n   [5] On July 1, 2004, plaintiffs disclosed the identities of\nforty-five inmates they expected to have testify regarding\nprison conditions. At least eighteen of the twenty-four state-\nments that the County sought to introduce under Rule\n801(d)(2) were taken from detainees on that list. We are satis-\nfied that, on the facts of this case, reliance on statements by\ndetainees who had been disclosed by plaintiffs’ counsel as\npotential witnesses adequately protected the class from the\nrisk of having the class’s interests undermined by unrepresen-\ntative class members. The district court did not abuse its dis-\ncretion by admitting those statements.9\n\n   The remaining statements admitted by the court, and now\nchallenged by the plaintiffs, were not disclosed to plaintiffs.\nWe need not decide whether the statements of these detainees\nshould have been excluded under Rule 801, as we conclude,\nupon review of the record as a whole (and in particular the\nother eighteen admitted statements), that the admission of\nthose five statements was not prejudicial. See Sablan v. Dep’t\nof Fin. of Com. of N. Mariana Islands, 856 F.2d 1317, 1323\n(9th Cir. 1988).\n  9\n    Although we conclude that the district court did not abuse it discretion,\nin so doing we do not adopt a blanket rule of admissibility for the state-\nments of absent class members pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A).\nAbsent class members are considered “parties for some purposes and not\nfor others.” Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 10 (2002). Here, we are sat-\nisfied that there were adequate strictures in place—conditioning the Coun-\nty’s ability to obtain absent class member statements on notice to\nplaintiffs’ counsel, disclosure of the nature of the suit, and plaintiffs’\ncounsel’s presence when the statements were taken—to ensure that the\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 801 were met, while still respecting the\nlimitations on absent class member discovery inherent in Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                    5585\nC.   The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n     terminating the Stewart orders absent an explicit\n     motion by the Pierce defendants.\n\n   Plaintiffs contend that the district court did not have the\nauthority to vacate the Stewart injunction because the defen-\ndant failed to make the necessary motion. Plaintiffs further\nargue that they were not given adequate notice of the district\ncourt’s intent to consider vacating all of the injunctive orders\nin effect under Stewart (including orders pertaining to issues\nthat had not been raised in Pierce), and that this was a denial\nof due process. A district court generally has “broad” discre-\ntion to consolidate actions; we review its decision on consoli-\ndation under an abuse of discretion standard. Investor’s\nResearch Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of Cal., 877\nF.2d 777, 777 (9th Cir. 1989) (“broad discretion” to consoli-\ndate actions pending in the same district); Washington v.\nDaley, 173 F.3d 1158, 1169 n.13 (9th Cir. 1999) (court’s\ndecision on consolidation reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n\n   The PLRA “establishes standards for the entry and termina-\ntion of prospective relief in civil actions challenging prison\nconditions.” Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 331 (2000). The\nPLRA both limits the prospective relief a court may order in\nsuch suits, and authorizes the termination of relief that does\nnot fall within those limits. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)-(b). Section\n3626(b)(1)(A) of Title 18 provides:\n\n     In any civil action with respect to prison conditions\n     in which prospective relief is ordered, such relief\n     shall be terminable upon the motion of any party or\n     intervener . . . (iii) in the case of an order issued on\n     or before the date of enactment of the Prison Litiga-\n     tion Reform Act, 2 years after such date of enact-\n     ment.\n\nId. § 3626(b)(1)(A). The Stewart orders long pre-dated the\nPLRA’s enactment, and more than two years had passed after\n\f5586                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nthe enactment when this suit commenced. As such, the relief\nwas “terminable upon the motion of any party or intervener,”\nprovided that the orders were not found to fall within the limi-\ntation set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).10 More generally,\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), a district court\nmay “take cognizance of changed circumstances and relieve\na party from a continuing decree.” Gilmore v. California, 220\nF.3d 987, 1007 (9th Cir. 2000). The text of Rule 60(b) pro-\nvides that this may happen “[o]n motion and just terms.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 60(b). In March 2004, approximately eight months\nbefore trial, the district court consolidated Stewart and Pierce,\nciting the fact that questions of the continuing legitimacy of\nthe injunctive orders in Stewart had been raised in various\nmotions in Pierce. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 42 (giving the district\ncourt authority to consolidate matters involving common\nquestions of law or fact).11 The court provided the parties with\nnotice that it would review the status of the existing Stewart\norders and ordered related briefing. The plaintiffs did not\nobject, and filed a brief addressing the legal bases for all of\nthe Stewart orders.\n\n   Prior to the district court’s decision to vacate the Stewart\norders, the County made two written requests for termination\nor modification—first, in its pre-trial brief, and then in its\nclosing brief after trial. While only the latter was styled a\nmotion, the former formally requested that “the Stewart\norders either be vacated or modified.”\n  10\n    As discussed further infra, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3) states:\n     [p]rospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written\n     findings based on the record that prospective relief remains nec-\n     essary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal\n     right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of\n     the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly\n     drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\n  11\n     Plaintiffs acknowledged at a March 5, 2004 status conference that the\nCounty had raised questions about the enforceability of the orders in Stew-\nart.\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                           5587\n   [6] Plaintiffs have not challenged the district court’s author-\nity to consolidate Pierce and Stewart or, as the monitoring\ncourt, to review the status of the Stewart orders. Nor do the\nplaintiffs suggest any way in which, if accorded earlier notice,\nthey would have handled matters differently. Plaintiffs were\nprovided with adequate notice, and so we hold that the district\ncourt had authority to review and, if otherwise appropriate\nunder § 3626, to modify or to terminate the Stewart orders.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b); Miller, 530 U.S. at 353 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting) (observing that the district court may modify or\nterminate relief).12\n\n                          V.    MERITS RULINGS\n\n   We turn next to the district court’s merits rulings chal-\nlenged on appeal. First, we consider order by order whether\ntermination of the prospective relief ordered in Stewart was\nproper. Second, we consider the Pierce plaintiffs appeal of the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the mealtimes; holding cell\nconditions; and access to religious services, the day room, and\nexercise provided by the County did not violate plaintiffs’\nrights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.13 Third, we address plaintiffs’\n  12\n      In its final disposition the district court, in some instances, referred to\nhaving “vacate[d]” the Stewart orders. In other instances, tracking the lan-\nguage of the PLRA more closely, it said that the orders were “unneces-\nsary” and “terminable.” See § 3626(b) (orders shall not “terminate” absent\nfindings that prospective relief remains “necessary”). We read the district\ncourt’s Stewart Final Order as merely terminating prospective relief, not\nvacating the Stewart judgment in its entirety. See Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 662 (1st Cir. 1997) (PLRA only pro-\nvides for termination of prospective relief, not vacatur of judgments).\n   13\n      The district court considered only whether plaintiffs’ Rule 23(b)(2)\nequitable relief class was entitled to declaratory relief for these claims.\nThe court ruled that plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief under § 1983\nwas moot. The district court repeatedly acknowledged its authority under\n§ 3626 to modify (and thereby expand or diminish) the existing Stewart\ninjunction as it pertained to the same topics—mealtimes; holding cell con-\nditions; and access to religious services, the day room, and exercise—as\nrequired by the evidence presented. In light of this, we agree that the\ncourt’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ additional and separate request for injunc-\ntive relief in the same Orange County jails with regard to the same condi-\ntions was not in error.\n\f5588                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nchallenge to the district court’s finding of no actionable viola-\ntions under § 1983 or state law. Finally, we review the district\ncourt’s findings with respect to the § 1983 claims of physi-\ncally disabled detainees raised under the ADA and the equal\nprotection clause.\n\nA.     Standards for termination of prospective relief under\n       the PLRA.\n\n   [7] Under the PLRA, the Stewart injunctive orders should\nnot have been terminated if, on the record presented, they sat-\nisfied the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3). The Act\nprovides that relief shall not terminate if it “remains necessary\nto correct a current and ongoing violation of [a] Federal right,\nextends no further than necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right, and . . . is narrowly drawn and the least\nintrusive means to correct the violation.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3).14 Review of an injunction pursuant to the\nPLRA’s standards is thus sometimes referred to as a “need-\nnarrowness-intrusiveness” inquiry. Handberry v. Thompson,\n436 F.3d 52, 64 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n   [8] This standard requires an assessment of the\ncircumstances—both legal and factual—at the time termina-\ntion is sought. See Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 1010 (citing Benja-\nmin v. Jacobsen, 172 F.3d 144, 166 (2d Cir. 1999)). As state\npretrial detainees, plaintiffs are protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause, as well as specific sub-\nstantive guarantees of the federal Constitution, such as the\nFirst and Eighth Amendments. Under the Due Process Clause,\ndetainees have a right against jail conditions or restrictions\n  14\n     The district court’s final order in Stewart suggests that the fact that a\nparticular right has been well-established may militate against a finding\nthat prospective relief remains necessary and appropriate. This view is\nunsupported by § 3626(b)(3). The question, in such a case, is simply\nwhether there is a current and ongoing violation of the right, and whether\nthe relief is properly tailored to correct the violation as required by the\nstatute.\n\f                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                  5589\nthat “amount to punishment.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\n535-37 (1979). This standard differs significantly from the\nstandard relevant to convicted prisoners, who may be subject\nto punishment so long as it does not violate the Eighth\nAmendment’s bar against cruel and unusual punishment. Id.\nat 535 n.16.\n\n   Absent evidence of express punitive intent, it may be possi-\nble to infer a given restriction’s punitive status “from the\nnature of the restriction.” Valdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d\n1039, 1045 (9th Cir. 2002); see Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d\n1020, 1030 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that “to constitute punish-\nment, the harm or disability caused by the government’s\naction must either significantly exceed, or be independent of,\nthe inherent discomforts of confinement”). As the Supreme\nCourt has explained, the determination of whether a particular\ncondition or restriction imposes punishment in the constitu-\ntional sense will generally turn on whether an alternate pur-\npose is reasonably assignable:\n\n    if a particular condition or restriction of pretrial\n    detention is reasonably related to a legitimate gov-\n    ernmental objective, it does not without more,\n    amount to “punishment.” Conversely, if a restriction\n    or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate\n    goal—if it is arbitrary or purposeless—a court per-\n    missibly may infer that the purpose of the govern-\n    mental action is punishment that may not\n    constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua\n    detainees.\n\nBell, 441 U.S. at 539 (alterations in original) (quoting Ken-\nnedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168-69 (1963)); see\nid. at 539 n.21 (noting that a de minimis level of imposition\nis permissible). Legitimate nonpunitive governmental objec-\ntives include “maintaining security and order” and “operating\nthe [detention facility] in a manageable fashion.” Id. at 540\nn.23.\n\f5590                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n   The Due Process Clause also protects detainees’ state-\ncreated liberty interests. See Kentucky Dep’t of Corr. v.\nThompson, 490 U.S. 454, 462 (1989). For a state statute or\nregulation to create a liberty interest protected by the Consti-\ntution, two things must be true:\n\n       [f]irst, the law must set forth “ ‘substantive predi-\n       cates’ to govern official decision making” and, sec-\n       ond, it must contain “explicitly mandatory\n       language,” i.e., a specific directive to the decision-\n       maker that mandates a particular outcome if the sub-\n       stantive predicates have been met.\n\nValdez, 302 F.3d at 1044 (quoting Thompson, 490 U.S. at\n462-63).15\n\n   Finally, pretrial detainees retain other specific constitu-\ntional guarantees. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 545. As with the Four-\nteenth Amendment’s substantive due process analysis,\nhowever, the detainees’ rights may be subject to restrictions\nand limitations based on legitimate government concerns:\n“when an institutional restriction infringes a specific constitu-\ntional guarantee, such as the First Amendment, the practice\nmust be evaluated in the light of the central objective of\nprison administration, safeguarding institutional security.” Id.\nat 547.\n\n   Assuming the prospective relief at issue is found to be nec-\nessary to correct a current and ongoing constitutional viola-\ntion, we must consider whether § 3626(b)(3)’s need-\nnarrowness-intrusiveness criteria are met. A determination of\nwhether the relief goes “no further than necessary to correct\nthe violation” and is “narrowly drawn and the least intrusive\nmeans to correct the violation” will obviously rest upon case-\n  15\n    This test—used in Thompson, 490 U.S. at 462-63, and Hewitt v.\nHelms, 459 U.S. 460, 471-72 (1983)—remains the proper standard in the\ncontext of pretrial detainees. Valdez, 302 F.3d at 1044 n.3.\n\f                    PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                   5591\nspecific factors—namely, the extent of the current and ongo-\ning constitutional violations. See, e.g., Morales Feliciano v.\nRullan, 378 F.3d 42, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Arm-\nstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 870 (9th Cir. 2001)\n(“Armstrong ‘01”) (noting, for example, that a “few isolated\nviolations affecting a narrow range of plaintiffs” would not\nprovide a basis for system-wide relief).\n\n   The parties operated under the agreement that the burden of\nproof to terminate the Stewart orders pursuant to § 3626 was\non the County. We proceed under this assumption, without so\nholding, because the assignment of the burden of proof is not\ndispositive of any issue raised by the parties.16\n\nB.     The district court properly terminated eleven of the\n       fourteen Stewart Orders under review.\n\n   For nine of the Stewart orders, the County’s showing of\ncompliance was not contested. We briefly discuss these in\nsubsection V.B.1, below, and affirm the district court’s termi-\nnation of these orders. Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 1008. We address\ntwo additional Stewart orders (related to seating in holding\ncells and adequate meal times) for which the parties did pre-\nsent conflicting evidence, in subsection V.B.2. Because our\nreview of these two orders overlaps considerably with our\nreview of the claims brought by the plaintiffs in Pierce under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and California state law, we address plain-\ntiffs’ claims as part of our review of the termination of the\norders themselves.\n  16\n   We note that there may be some tension in our case law in this area.\nCompare Mayweathers v. Newland, 258 F.3d 930 (9th Cir. 2001) with Gil-\nmore, 220 F.3d at 1008.\n\f5592                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n  1.    Termination of Stewart Orders related to reading\n        materials, mattresses and beds, law books, population\n        caps, sleep, blankets, telephone access, and\n        communication with jailhouse lawyers.\n\n   [9] The district court found that the Stewart order regarding\nthe availability of reading materials by mail, as well as the\norder regarding the availability of mattresses and beds, prop-\nerly sought to enforce detainees’ federal rights. The district\ncourt also acknowledged that the Stewart order regarding law-\nbook access merely required that the County’s policy be\napplied to each of its jail facilities. The district court went on\nto conclude, however, that these orders were not needed to\ncorrect current and ongoing violations. We agree. The County\npresented evidence tending to show its compliance with these\nStewart orders,17 and the plaintiffs did not present any con-\ntrary evidence related to these orders to contest the County’s\nshowing.\n\n   The district court also acknowledged that population caps\nmay be an appropriate remedy when overcrowding rises to the\nlevel of constitutional violation, but found no ongoing viola-\ntion here. On the record presented we agree.\n\n   Finally, the district court terminated the Stewart orders per-\ntaining to sleeptimes, blanket use, telephone access, commu-\nnications with “jailhouse lawyers,” and visitation for inmates\nin administrative segregation. In light of the County’s presen-\ntation of evidence and the plaintiffs’ failure to contest the\nCounty’s showing, we affirm the district court on the ground\n  17\n     Testimony and documentary evidence showed that deputies and other\nofficials or employees of the Sheriff’s department received substantial\ntraining regarding the Stewart orders, and that department policies had\nbeen modified to reflect the requirements set out in Stewart. In addition,\nlaminated reference cards were distributed to jail employees, to be carried\nin their uniforms, as reminders of the Stewart orders. Sheriff’s department\nemployees testified, with specificity, to their roles in ensuring compliance\nwith the Stewart orders.\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE              5593\nthat these orders are not necessary to correct current and\nongoing violations. We therefore do not reach the question of\nwhether these orders extend no further than necessary and are\nnarrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the\nviolation. See § 3626(b)(3).\n\n  2.        Termination of Stewart Orders related to seating and\n            meal times.\n\n       a.     Seating/holding cells.\n\n  [10] The Stewart order requires that inmates be provided\nwith seating while detained in holding cells, or elsewhere,\nawaiting transport to or from court. We affirm the district\ncourt’s termination of the order, as we conclude that the evi-\ndence presented does not suggest that the continuation of pro-\nspective relief was necessary to correct a current and ongoing\nconstitutional violation.\n\n   The record shows that the County actively seeks to avoid\novercrowding of holding cells; maximum capacities are\nposted in the cells, and deputies monitor the cells to ensure\ncompliance. Deputies testified that, on occasion, overcrowd-\ning of a particular holding cell may be necessary for logistical\nand security reasons, but—as the district court found—these\ninstances occur infrequently. Moreover, the record here shows\nthat the hardship associated with the County’s occasional\novercrowding of the holding cells does not rise to the level of\nconstitutional violation, given the relatively short periods (i.e.,\nmatters of hours) detainees spend in the holding cells. There\nis no evidence of unsanitary conditions or other concerns that\nwould elevate such overcrowding to a constitutional violation.\nSee, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 542; Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d\n96, 103 (2d Cir. 1981). For these reasons, we also affirm the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that plaintiffs failed to establish\nthat the treatment of detainees in the County’s holding cells\nconstituted a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\f5594                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n       b.   Time for meals.\n\n   The Stewart order requires that inmates be given “not less\nthan fifteen minutes within which to complete each meal.”\nThe district court terminated this Stewart order and rejected\nplaintiffs’ § 1983 claim that they had been denied adequate\nmeal times in violation of a federally protected right.\n\n   [11] Turning to plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim, we conclude that\nthey have not established that the mealtimes allowed by the\nCounty amounted to punishment in the constitutional sense\nand thus a deprivation of substantive due process. The only\npotential ground for constitutional relief suggested by the\nrecord would be a liberty interest created by a state regulation,\nin this case Cal. Code. Regs. Tit. 15, § 1240. See Kentucky\nDep’t of Corr. v Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 462 (1989). How-\never, the plaintiffs have not appealed the district court’s pre-\ntrial ruling that this was not adequately pled as a basis for\n§ 1983 relief.\n\n   Finally, plaintiffs brought a state law claim for relief based\non California Code of Regulations § 1240. Even assuming,\nwithout deciding, that § 1240 is sufficient to create an action-\nable duty under California law, see Cal. Govt. Code § 815.6;\nHaggis v. City of Los Angeles, 22 Cal. 4th 490, 498-99 (2000)\n(to be actionable under § 815.6, the enactment at issue must:\n(1) be obligatory, rather than discretionary or permissive; (2)\nmust require that a particular action be taken or not taken, and\n(3) require that the mandatory duty be designed to prevent the\nkind of injury suffered by the plaintiff), in light of the policies\nand procedures implemented by the County to facilitate com-\npliance with the Stewart order, we affirm the district court’s\nconclusion that the County exercised reasonable diligence.18\n  18\n     We offer no view whether the parties may pursue state remedies in\nstate court for violations of the state constitution, statutes or mandatory\nregulations.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE               5595\nC.     The district court erred by terminating two Stewart\n       orders mandating minimal access to religious services\n       and exercise for inmates housed in administrative\n       segregation.\n\n   Three of the remaining fourteen Stewart orders under\nreview concern conditions for inmates in administrative seg-\nregation. As mentioned above, see n.3, supra, administrative\nsegregation is a classification for inmates with violent tenden-\ncies that have been deemed a threat to the jail’s staff or to\nother inmates. The Stewart orders provide that inmates classi-\nfied as administrative segregation must nonetheless be pro-\nvided with limited access to religious services, limited access\nto exercise, and limited access to use of a day room. The dis-\ntrict court terminated all three Stewart orders ensuring such\naccess, and likewise found that plaintiffs had not proved any\nactionable § 1983 claim based on a deprivation of those\nrights. As explained below, we conclude that the district\ncourt’s finding that inmates in administrative segregation\nwere only “sporadically” denied access to religious services\nis clearly erroneous. The denials were systematic, and suffi-\nciently so to constitute a violation of § 1983. Likewise, the\nrecord also demonstrates that detainees in administrative seg-\nregation were not provided with even the two hours per week\nof exercise required under the Stewart order. We are satisfied\nthat providing inmates only ninety minutes of exercise per\nweek—less than thirteen minutes per day—does not comport\nwith constitutional standards, and that such a severe curtail-\nment of the detainees’ ability to exercise evidences its puni-\ntive intent and necessitates reinstatement of the Stewart order.\n\n  1.    Termination of Stewart order related to religious\n        worship.\n\n   The Stewart order requires that inmates in administrative\nsegregation be allowed one of the following opportunities for\nreligious worship: attending regularly scheduled religious ser-\nvices once a week, making short individual visits to the\n\f5596                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nchapel once each week, or meeting with a bona fide religious\nadviser upon request of the inmate or adviser. The order also\nprovides for the curtailment or elimination of the right if, in\nthe course of exercising it, the inmate is disruptive or violent.\n\n   [12] Under the Constitution, “reasonable opportunities\nmust be afforded to all prisoners to exercise the religious free-\ndom guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”\nCruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322 n.2 (1972) (addressing the\nrights of convicted prisoners). However, as with other First\nAmendment rights in the inmate context, detainees’ rights\nmay be limited or retracted if required to “maintain[ ] institu-\ntional security and preserv[e] internal order and discipline.”\nBell, 441 U.S. at 549; see, e.g., Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d\n732, 737 (9th Cir. 1997). Restrictions on access to “religious\nopportunities”—whether group services, chapel visits, or\nmeetings with religious advisers—must be found reasonable\nin light of four factors: (1) whether there is a “valid, rational\nconnection” between the regulation and a legitimate govern-\nment interest put forward to justify it; (2) “whether there are\nalternative means of exercising the right that remain open to\nprison inmates”; (3) whether accommodation of the asserted\nconstitutional right would have a significant impact on guards\nand other inmates; and (4) whether ready alternatives are\nabsent (bearing on the reasonableness of the regulation). Tur-\nner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90 (1987); see also Beard v.\nBanks, 126 S. Ct. 2572 (2006); Mauro v. Arpaio, 188 F.3d\n1054, 1058-59 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Further, because we\nare dealing with pretrial detainees, to satisfy substantive due\nprocess requirements the restriction or regulation cannot be\nintended to serve a punitive interest. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535.19\n  19\n     The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\n(“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et seq., requires the government to\nmeet a higher burden of proof than the rational basis standard of Turner.\nSee Green v. Solano County Jail, 513 F.3d 982 (9th Cir. 2008). Because\nthe plaintiffs have not brought a RLUIPA claim, we apply only the consti-\ntutional analysis and the Turner standard.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE               5597\n   [13] As the district court observed, under this standard\nsome courts have allowed restrictions on worship for security\npurposes. Perdraza v. Meyer, 919 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir.\n1990) (restriction on type of service inmate may attend per-\nmissible where inmate still provided with reasonable opportu-\nnities to worship). Denying inmates access to all outlets for\nreligious worship, however, offers no “alternative means of\nexercising the right,” as called for by the second prong of Tur-\nner. Cf. O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342 (1987)\n(concluding that prison rules which prohibited Muslim\ninmates from engaging in Friday afternoon prayer services\nwere reasonable, and relying in part on the fact that the\ninmates were allowed to participate in other weekly religious\nservices and to have “free access” to the prison’s imam).\n\n   [14] Accordingly, a detainee’s placement in administrative\nsegregation does not, standing alone, justify a complete denial\nof opportunities to practice religion. See Alston v. DeBruyn,\n13 F.3d 1036, 1040 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that it was\nimproper for the district court to assume that limits on an\ninmate’s access to religious services were justified based on\nthe inmate’s placement in administrative segregation);\nMawhinney v. Henderson, 542 F.2d 1, 3 (2d Cir. 1976) (hold-\ning that inmates in “punitive segregation and keeplock” could\nnot be denied participation in chapel services simply on the\nbasis of their classification; individualized determinations of\nthe “necessity of their exclusion” were required).\n\n   The district court’s final order in Stewart states that there\nwas “no indication of punishment” or “any ongoing violation”\nof detainees’ rights with respect to access to religious ser-\nvices. Although the court’s final order in Pierce acknowl-\nedges evidence of at least “[o]ccasional instances of\nimpediments to participation,” the court characterized these\ndenials as merely “sporadic.” But the record evidences consis-\ntent denial of access to the chapel (whether for group services\nor individual visits) and to religious advisers to those in\nadministrative segregation.\n\f5598                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n   Both of the plaintiffs’ witnesses that were housed in admin-\nistrative segregation, Fermin Valenzuela and Keith Hawkins,\ntestified that they were routinely denied access to any kind of\nreligious worship. Valenzuela testified that none of his\nrequests to meet with his chaplain were granted, and testified\nthat the verbal explanation he received for the denial was that\ninmates “in administrative segregation . . . don’t have it com-\ning.” Likewise, Hawkins testified that when he was classified\nin administrative segregation between March 2003 and June\n2003, he was “never” allowed to attend chapel. Even the\nCounty’s own witness, Deputy Brian Nissen, testified that he\nhad “never seen one of our Ad Seg inmates” in chapel.\n\n   The County’s evidence was not to the contrary. Although\nthe County argues on appeal that testimony from three\ndetainee plaintiffs (detainees Conn, Palmitessa and Robledo)\nsupported its contention that it provided “regular access to\nreligious services and clergy at every opportunity,” the record\ndoes not bear out the County’s characterization. Conn—who\nwas not an administrative segregation inmate—merely testi-\nfied that he was permitted to attend chapel and that no Deputy\never told him that administrative segregation inmates had lim-\nited access to religious services. We are not persuaded that an\ninmate’s failure to obtain a voluntary admission of non-\ncompliance from his jailer somehow constitutes proof of com-\npliance. Similarly, Palmitessa—also not an administrative\nsegregation detainee—testified that he went to chapel when-\never it was offered, but that it had not, in fact, been offered\nto him for several weeks. Finally, Robledo—another non-\nadministrative segregation witness—testified on cross-\nexamination that she was allowed access to religious services,\nbut as she made clear on re-direct, she had “difficulties” get-\nting access to chapel.20\n  20\n    Although the County offers the testimony of these three non-\nadministrative segregation detainees to support affirmance, it simulta-\nneously chastises the plaintiffs for referring to the testimony of several\nother non-administrative segregation detainees who testified that they had\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5599\n   Nor did the County’s affirmative evidence support the dis-\ntrict court’s factual finding that the County provides “opportu-\nnities for inmates to participate in religious services and\ncounseling,” at least not as to administrative segregation\ndetainees. The County relied primarily on the testimony of\ntwo jail personnel—Sergeant Dubsky and Deputy McCulloch\n—to support its contention that inmates were provided “regu-\nlar access to religious services and clergy at every opportuni-\nty.” Sergeant Dubsky testified that administrative segregation\ndetainees must fill out a message slip to obtain access to a\nchaplain, and that there is no limitation on the number of vis-\nits available. But Sergeant Dubsky did not testify that admin-\nistrative segregation detainees were actually given such\naccess. Likewise, Deputy McCulloch merely testified as to the\nmanner in which chapel is called for non-administrative seg-\nregation detainees. He did not establish that chapel was called\nweekly, bi-weekly or with any other pattern of regularity.\n\n   A custom can be shown or a policy can be inferred from\nwidespread practices or “evidence of repeated constitutional\nviolations for which the errant municipal officers were not\ndischarged or reprimanded.” Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d\n1342, 1349 (9th Cir. 1992); see also Nadell v. Las Vegas\nMetro. Police Dep’t, 268 F.3d 924, 929 (9th Cir. 2001). Plain-\ntiffs’ counsel asked the Sheriffs’ department officials who tes-\ntified whether deputies were ever disciplined or reprimanded\nfor Stewart violations. No witness was able to identify any\n\ngreat difficulty in gaining any access to religious services. For example,\nDetainee Ronald Rogers testified that he had “never in over two-and-a-\nhalf years been offered religious services.” Detainee James Sukanich testi-\nfied that when housed in the main jail he had not been given access to any\nreligious services for seven months. Detainee Edward Swanstrom testified\nthat he received “no response” to his multiple requests for access to reli-\ngious services. Although the district court’s finding of “sporadic” denials\nis erroneous without consideration of this additional testimony, it nonethe-\nless undermines the County’s claim that inmates, in any population,\nreceived regular access to religious services.\n\f5600              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\ninstance in which disciplinary steps were taken or a reprimand\nwas issued.\n\n   [15] Moreover, the County’s witnesses did not contend, and\nits brief on appeal does not suggest, that detainees in adminis-\ntrative segregation are denied worship opportunities because\nof security concerns, or for other legitimate non-punitive rea-\nsons. The district court should not have blindly deferred to the\nCounty’s bare invocation of security concerns, when the\nCounty has failed to even establish that there is regular access\nto religious services for administrative segregation detainees,\nmuch less that interruptions in such access are on account of\nsecurity. Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 386 (9th Cir. 1989)\n(“Without requiring some evidence that prison policies are\nbased on legitimate penological justifications . . . ‘judicial\nreview of prison policies would not be meaningful.’ ”) (cita-\ntion omitted). In sum, the district court erred in denying\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief under § 1983.\n\n   [16] Similarly, the Stewart order remains necessary to\nensure that detainees in administrative segregation are not\ndenied access based on their classification alone. We there-\nfore reverse the judgment of the district court with regard to\nthis component of the Stewart injunction, as the record dem-\nonstrates that its enforcement “remains necessary to correct a\ncurrent and ongoing violation of [a] Federal right.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3). We also conclude that the Stewart order, as\npresently constituted, extends no further than is necessary and\nis the least intrusive means to correct the violation. Id. The\nterms of the Stewart injunction require that detainees in\nadministrative segregation be afforded opportunities for wor-\nship, provided the detainees have not become disruptive or\nviolent, implicating legitimate security concerns, even though\nthe injunction does not require that detainees be afforded\naccess to group religious services. The jail may instead satisfy\nthe order by allowing individual chapel visits or meetings\nwith religious advisers. In sum, the order—with its provision\nfor the curtailment or elimination of detainees’ rights based\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE            5601\non security concerns—provides for no more than a minimum\nlevel of ongoing participation in religious activities. Accord-\ningly, we conclude that the injunction is narrowly drawn and\nextends no further than necessary to correct the violation of\na Federal right. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).\n\n  2.   Termination of Stewart order related to regular\n       exercise.\n\n   [17] Exercise is one of the basic human necessities pro-\ntected by the Eighth Amendment. See LeMaire v. Maass, 12\nF.3d 1444, 1457 (9th Cir. 1993) (as amended). Moreover, the\nFourteenth Amendment requires that pretrial detainees not be\ndenied adequate opportunities for exercise without legitimate\ngovernmental objective. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 538. Determin-\ning what constitutes adequate exercise requires consideration\nof “the physical characteristics of the cell and jail and the\naverage length of stay of the inmates.” Housley v. Dodson, 41\nF.3d 597, 599 (10th Cir. 1994). In the Orange County jails,\nthe average period of pretrial detention is 110 days, with those\naccused of being “third strike” offenders spending an average\nof 312 days. Even by conservative estimates, detainees in\nadministrative segregation and protective custody21 spend\ntwenty-two hours or more in their cells each day.\n\n   As the district court noted, other courts have held that\ndetainees who are held for more than a short time and spend\nthe bulk of their time inside their cells are ordinarily entitled\nto daily exercise, or five to seven hours of exercise per week,\noutside their cells. See Campbell v. Cauthron, 623 F.2d 503,\n507 (8th Cir. 1980) (holding that pretrial detainees are gener-\nally entitled to one hour of exercise outside their cells daily\nif they spend more than sixteen hours in their cells); see also\nHousley, 41 F.3d at 599 (“ ‘a failure to provide inmates (con-\nfined for more than a very short period . . . ) with the opportu-\nnity for at least five hours a week of exercise outside the cell\n  21\n    See n.3, supra.\n\f5602                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nraises serious constitutional questions’ ”) (quoting Davenport\nv. DeRobertis, 844 F.2d 1310, 1315 (7th Cir. 1988)). And at\nleast one district court, in a class action brought pursuant to\n§ 1983 challenging pre-trial conditions of confinement, has\nheld that “defendants’ failure to provide each inmate one hour\nper day of exercise outside the cells is a constitutionally intol-\nerable condition.” Hutchings v. Corum, 501 F. Supp. 1276,\n1294 (D. Neb. 1980).\n\n   [18] The record shows that pretrial detainees in administra-\ntive segregation and other restrictive classifications, such as\nprotective custody, are typically afforded, at best, only ninety\nminutes weekly in a space equipped for exercise.22 Although\nwe need not hold that there is a specific minimum amount of\nweekly exercise that must be afforded to detainees who spend\nthe bulk of their time inside their cells, we hold that providing\nthe equivalent of slightly less than thirteen minutes of exer-\ncise a day does not give meaningful protection to this basic\nhuman necessity. See Lemaire, 12 F.3d at 1457; Housely, 41\nF.3d at 599. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs have estab-\nlished a violation of § 1983.\n\n   [19] In finding no punitive intent, the district court relied\nexclusively on the fact that “a group of detainees congregat-\ning in an open area containing weights and other equipment\nraises security concerns.” We agree that the County has con-\nsiderable discretion to curtail access to exercise based on\nsecurity concerns. Bell, 441 U.S. at 539 n.23. Here, however,\nthe curtailment to ninety minutes weekly for inmates who oth-\n  22\n     The County contends that, contrary to the testimony of several\ninmates, detainees may also exercise in the day rooms. The County con-\ncedes, however, that day rooms are not designed for exercise and that\ndetainees may not use any of the room’s fixtures (such as bars, chairs,\ntables, or wall hooks) for exercise purposes. While inmates’ access to day\nrooms, discussed further infra, is a factor affecting our determination of\nwhat constitutes adequate exercise, it does not—given the space con-\nstraints and absence of any appropriate equipment—constitute an exercise\nopportunity.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                5603\nerwise spend the bulk of their time inside their cells reduces\nthe amount of exercise to a point at which there is no mean-\ningful vindication of the constitutional right to exercise for\nthis entire category of detainees. The County has provided\nnothing more to justify this almost complete denial of exer-\ncise than a generalized reference to institutional security con-\ncerns. It has made no showing that such a severe restriction\nis reasonably related to satisfying those concerns. Compare\nSpain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 192, 199-200 (9th Cir.\n1979) (impermissible to completely deny access to outdoor\nexercise for a particular category of inmates, even when\ninmates within that category were being disciplined for com-\nmitting violent acts while in prison) with LeMaire, 12 F.3d at\n1458 (upholding denial of exercise privileges for a particular\ninmate deemed a “grave security risk” who had previously\nattacked corrections officers). Given the severity of the cur-\nrent restrictions and their application across an entire category\nof detainees, we conclude that ninety minutes of exercise per\nweek constitutes punishment for purposes of § 1983.\n\n   [20] Accordingly, we also determine that the Stewart order,\nwhich requires that inmates in administrative segregation be\npermitted exercise at least twice each week for a total of not\nless than 2 hours per week, is “necessary to correct a current\nand ongoing violation of [a] Federal right.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3). We likewise conclude that the Stewart order, as\nit is currently constituted, is “narrowly drawn and is the least\nintrusive means to correct the violation.” Id. The Stewart\norder requires considerably less exercise—just two hours a\nweek—than the one hour a day recognized elsewhere as a\nconstitutional floor. More importantly, the Stewart order con-\ntains a safety-valve that permits the County, in its discretion,\nto “curtail or eliminate” exercise rights “in the event such\ninmate becomes violent or disruptive in the course of exercis-\ning such rights.” Thus, the existing Stewart order accords the\nCounty sufficient deference in determining whether a particu-\nlar inmate poses a risk to security requiring limitations on or\n\f5604              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nrevocation of the right. On remand, the district court must\nreinstate the Stewart order and enjoin violation under § 1983.\n\n  3.   Termination of Stewart order related to access to day\n       room.\n\n   The Stewart order requires that inmates be given access to\nthe day room for two hours daily, but provides for curtailment\nor elimination of the right to day room access for security or\ndisciplinary reasons. Confinement necessarily imposes\nrestraints on detainees’ freedom of movement and access to\nrecreation. Nonetheless, such restrictions may “constitute\npunishment in the constitutional sense,” and thus violate the\nFourteenth Amendment, if they are not “rationally related to\na legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose and . . . appear\nexcessive in relation to that purpose.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 561.\nGiven the conditions and average duration of confinement in\nadministrative segregation and similarly restrictive classifica-\ntions, failure to provide detainees with the opportunity for\nsome daily out-of-cell movement raises serious constitutional\nquestions. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 (considering day room\naccess as a factor that mitigates overcrowding); Lock v. Jen-\nkins, 641 F.2d 488, 493-94 (7th Cir. 1981) (finding that the\nimportance of day room access increases as the length of time\nthe detainee spends in the cell increases and the size of the\ncell decreases).\n\n   [21] The record evidence demonstrated that administrative\nsegregation detainees, were, in fact, given access to the day\nroom. The restrictions placed on use of the day room—\nlimiting administrative segregation detainees’ use of the room\nto one or two inmates at a time—are reasonably related to\ninstitutional security concerns. For these reasons, we affirm\nthe district court’s denial of plaintiffs’ claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, because in this instance the County’s restrictions still\npermit access to the day rooms and do not evince any punitive\nintent. Accordingly, there is no evidence of a “current and\nongoing violation of a Federal right,” and we therefore also\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5605\naffirm the district court’s termination of this Stewart order. 18\nU.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).23\n\nD.     The district court erred by finding that the County\n       was not in violation of the ADA.\n\n   Having addressed the portions of this appeal relating to the\nStewart injunction and the claims of the overall Pierce class,\nwe turn our attention to the rights of the Pierce sub-class of\nmobility- and dexterity-impaired pretrial detainees.\n\n   Plaintiffs argued at trial that the County was not in compli-\nance with the ADA or California’s co-extensive access\nrequirements at § 54.1 of the California Civil Code. Plaintiffs\nmaintained that the County failed to address numerous struc-\ntural barriers and, as a result, denied mobility- and dexterity-\nimpaired detainees access to various features and elements of\ntheir cells and common spaces. They also argued that,\nbecause of their disabilities, they were segregated and denied\naccess to a variety of the County’s educational, rehabilitative,\nand recreation programs, services, and activities for pretrial\ndetainees. Despite finding that the County was not “in full\nADA compliance,” the district court “decline[d] to declare an\nADA or California Civil Code violation, or order injunctive\nrelief.” This decision cannot stand. As we explain below, we\n  23\n     Plaintiffs advance two related claims based on state law. First, plain-\ntiffs argue that § 1053 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulation\ncreates a general mandatory duty actionable under § 815.6 of the Califor-\nnia Government Code. We disagree. Because of the high degree of discre-\ntion left to officials under § 1053, we do not agree that § 1053 satisfies the\nstandard articulated in Haggis, 22 Cal. 4th at 498. Second, plaintiffs main-\ntain that § 1065 of Title 15 creates a duty actionable under § 815.6. During\nthe relevant time period, § 1065 instructed the jails’ facility administrators\nto develop written policies and procedures to provide a minimum of three\nhours of exercise or recreation per week. Even assuming § 1065 satisfies\nCalifornia’s three-pronged test, see Haggis, 22 Cal. 4th at 498, the evi-\ndence does not show a lack of reasonable diligence in providing the\ndetainee population three hours of exercise or day room recreation per\nweek. We affirm the district court’s denial of these state law claims.\n\f5606                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nreverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n  1.    Standards for evaluation of the ADA claims.\n\n   [22] Pursuant to Title II of the ADA, a “qualified individual\nwith a disability” cannot, “by reason of such disability, be\nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be sub-\njected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12132.24 It is undisputed that Title II applies to the Orange\nCounty jails’ services, programs, and activities for detainees.\nSee Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 209-10\n(1998); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 691 (9th\nCir. 2001). The regulations promulgated under Title II spell\nout the obligations of public entities.25 Under the regulations,\na qualified individual with a disability (an individual for\nwhom reasonable modifications may be required, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12131(2)) must not be excluded from or denied the benefits\nof a public entity’s services, programs, or activities because\nthe entity’s facilities are inaccessible or unusable. See 28\nC.F.R. § 35.149.\n  24\n    The ADA’s definition of “public entity” includes “any department,\nagency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or\nStates or local government.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1); Lee v. City of Los\nAngeles, 250 F.3d 668, 691 (9th Cir. 2001).\n   The ADA defines a “qualified individual with a disability” to include\nanyone with a disability “who, with or without reasonable modifications\nto rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communica-\ntion, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and ser-\nvices, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of\nservices or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public\nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).\n   25\n      Congress authorized the Attorney General to promulgate regulations\nunder the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a). The regulations are therefore given\n“legislative and hence controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capri-\ncious, or plainly contrary to the statute.” United States v. Morton, 467 U.S.\n822, 834 (1984).\n\f                        PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5607\n   Generally, public entities must “make reasonable modifica-\ntions in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifica-\ntions are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of\ndisability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that mak-\ning the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of\nthe service, program, or activity.” Id. § 35.130(b)(7); see\nMcGary v. City of Portland, 386 F.3d 1259, 1265-67 (9th Cir.\n2004).\n\n   In a subsection titled “existing facilities,” the regulations\nprovide that a public entity must “operate each service, pro-\ngram, and activity so that the service, program, or activity,\nwhen viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable\nby individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a). The\nregulations, however, note in relevant part that: (1) a public\nentity is not necessarily required “to make each of its existing\nfacilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabili-\nties,” id. § 35.150(a)(1); and (2) a public entity is not required\n“to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a\nfundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or\nactivity or in undue financial and administrative burdens,” id.\n§ 35.150(a)(3).26\n  26\n    Section 35.150(a)(3) further explains:\n       In those circumstances where personnel of the public entity\n       believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the\n       service, program, or activity or would result in undue financial\n       and administrative burdens, a public entity has the burden of\n       proving that compliance with § 35.150(a) of this part would\n       result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance\n       would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the\n       head of a public entity or his or her designee after considering all\n       resources available for use in the funding and operation of the\n       service, program, or activity, and must be accompanied by a writ-\n       ten statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an\n       action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, a public\n       entity shall take any other action that would not result in such an\n       alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that\n       individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services pro-\n       vided by the public entity.\n\f5608              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n   The regulations allow public entities to use a variety of\nmethods to make existing facilities “readily accessible,”\nincluding the “reassignment of services to accessible build-\nings” and the “alteration of existing facilities and construction\nof new facilities.” Id. § 35.150(b)(1). Section 35.150(b)(1)\nprovides:\n\n    A public entity is not required to make structural\n    changes in existing facilities where other methods\n    are effective in achieving compliance with this sec-\n    tion. . . . In choosing among available methods for\n    meeting the requirements of this section, a public\n    entity shall give priority to those methods that offer\n    services, programs, and activities to qualified indi-\n    viduals with disabilities in the most integrated set-\n    ting appropriate.\n\nId.; see also 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A (stating that under Title\nII “the concept of program access will continue to apply with\nrespect to facilities now in existence, because the cost of\nretrofitting existing facilities is often prohibitive”).\n\n   To the extent that structural changes are to be made to an\nexisting facility, the accessibility requirements that apply to\nnew construction and alterations, set out in 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.151, must be met. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1). In addition,\nthe regulations require that an entity with more than fifty\nemployees, such as Orange County, develop a “transition\nplan” setting forth the steps that must be taken to complete\nany planned structural changes. Id. § 35.150(d)(1). Finally,\nJanuary 26, 1995, was the deadline for making structural\nchanges under the regulations. Id. § 35.150(c).\n\n   While § 35.150 addresses itself to “existing facilities,”\n§ 35.151 concerns “new construction and alterations.” The\nregulatory requirements in this section are somewhat more\nstraightforward. See Parker v. Universidad de Puerto Rico,\n225 F.3d 1, 6 & n.7 (1st Cir. 2000) (comparing Title II’s regu-\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5609\nlations governing “existing facilities” and “new construction\nand alterations”). Section 35.151 requires that any part of a\npublic entity’s facility constructed after January 26, 1992\nmust be designed and constructed “in conformance with the\nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards (‘UFAS’) (41 C.F.R.\nPt. 101-19.6, App. A) or with the Americans with Disabilities\nAct Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities\n(‘ADAAG’) (28 C.F.R. Pt. 36, App. A).” Id. § 35.151(a), (c)\n(allowing departures from these standards when it is “clearly\nevident that equivalent access” is afforded). And, to the maxi-\nmum extent possible, any part of a public entity’s facility\naltered after January 26, 1992 “in a manner that affects or\ncould affect [its] usability” must also be altered in confor-\nmance with one of these accessibility standards. Id.\n§ 35.151(b), (c).\n\n  2.    ADA standards             in     the     context      of    prison\n        administration.\n\n   While the regulations promulgated under Title II provide a\nframework for analyzing ADA claims generally, we have held\nthat inmates’ rights must be analyzed “in light of effective\nprison administration.” Gates v. Rowland, 39 F.3d 1439, 1446\n(9th Cir. 1994). As the district court observed, we held in\nGates, 39 F.3d at 1447, that inmates’ claims that their rights\nunder the Rehabilitation Act had been violated were subject\nto the so-called “reasonable relation” standard articulated in\nTurner. 482 U.S. at 89.27 Under Turner, a regulation that\n  27\n     Title II of the ADA was expressly modeled after § 504 of the Rehabil-\nitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (codified as amended\nin scattered sections of Title 29 of the United States Code), and essentially\nextends coverage to state and local government entities that do not receive\nfederal funds. Compare 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) with 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131,\n12132. We have therefore observed that “[t]here is no significant differ-\nence in analysis of the rights and obligations created by the ADA and the\nRehabilitation Act.” Zukle v. Regents of Univ. of California, 166 F.3d\n1041, 1045 n.11 (9th Cir. 1999); see Armstrong v. Wilson, 124 F.3d 1019,\n1023 (9th Cir. 1997) (noting that “Congress has directed that the ADA and\nRA be construed consistently”) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b)).\n\f5610                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nwould impinge on inmates’ constitutional rights is neverthe-\nless valid if it is reasonably related to the prison’s legitimate\ninterests.28 Id. We concluded in Gates that to prevail on a\nclaim that their statutory rights have been violated, inmates\nmust show that the challenged prison policy or regulation is\nunreasonable. Gates, 39 F.3d at 1447.29\n\n   In ADA cases, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing\nthe elements of the prima facie case, including—if needed—\n“the existence of a reasonable accommodation” that would\nenable him to participate in the program, service, or activity\nat issue. Zukle, 166 F.3d at 1046. The public entity may then\nrebut this by showing that the requested accommodation\nwould require a fundamental alteration or would produce an\nundue burden. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(3). As we explained\nin Zukle, determining whether a modification or accommoda-\ntion is reasonable always requires a fact-specific, context-\nspecific inquiry. 166 F.3d at 1048. This analysis permits a\n   28\n      Turner identified four factors relevant in determining the reasonable-\nness of prison policies, discussed briefly supra Section V.C.1. The first of\nthese—whether there is a “ ‘valid, rational connection’ between the prison\npolicy and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it[,]”\n482 U.S. at 89 (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 586 (1984))—\n“constitutes a sine qua non.” Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 385 (9th\nCir. 1990); see Ashker v. California Dep’t of Corr., 350 F.3d 917, 922 (9th\nCir. 2003) (same); see also Beard, 126 S. Ct. at 2577-79 (considering all\nfactors but noting “we believe that the first rationale itself satisfies Tur-\nner’s requirements”).\n   29\n      Plaintiffs argue that Supreme Court cases since Gates have effectively\noverruled the approach taken in that case. They note that the Supreme\nCourt, in holding that Title II applies to state prisons, reasoned that “[t]he\ntext of the ADA provides no basis for distinguishing these programs, ser-\nvices, and activities from those provided by public entities that are not\nprisons.” Yeskey, 524 U.S. at 210. Plaintiffs also note that in Johnson v.\nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499 (2005), the Supreme Court refused to analyze\ninmates’ claim of racial discrimination under Turner, opting instead for a\nstrict scrutiny analysis. The appeal before us today, however, does not\nrequire a reexamination of Gates, because reversal is warranted on this\nrecord even when measured against the deferential “reasonable relation”\nstandard.\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE             5611\ncourt to consider, with deference to the expert views of facil-\nity administrators, a detention or correctional facility’s legiti-\nmate interests (namely, in “maintaining security and order”\nand “operating [an] institution in a manageable fashion,” Bell,\n441 U.S. at 540 n.23) when determining whether a given\naccommodation is reasonable. Cf. Crawford v. Indiana Dep’t\nof Corr., 115 F.3d 481, 487 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\n  3.        The County has failed to reasonably accommodate\n            mobility-impaired and dexterity-impaired inmates in\n            violation of the ADA.\n\n   The plaintiff class of mobility- and dexterity-impaired pre-\ntrial detainees contends that the County’s failure to accommo-\ndate their disabilities has prevented them from enjoying a\nnumber of the County’s services, programs, and activities.\nThey argue that the County has not reasonably addressed vari-\nous structural barriers, and maintains unreasonable policies\nand practices in violation of the ADA.\n\n       a.     Physical barriers.\n\n   With regard to barriers, the district court found the evi-\ndence to show that “the Orange County jails have not yet been\nbrought into full ADA compliance. In 2000, Orange County\nadopted a Transition Plan to move existing facilities toward\nADA compliance. That plan was directed more toward struc-\ntural modifications of public and visitor areas than toward\ncompliance in inmate areas.” The district court went on to\nstate that “inmate witnesses and plaintiff’s expert, Mr. Robert-\nson, identified various specific architectural barriers and fea-\ntures that are out of compliance with the ADA.”\n\n   These findings are clearly supported by the record. As of\n2004, when the case went to trial, the County housed\nmobility- and dexterity-impaired pretrial detainees in two of\nits five facilities—the Men’s and Women’s Central Jails.\nMale inmates with such disabilities were placed in one of\n\f5612                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nthree parts of Module O in the Men’s Jail: Sheltered Living,\nWard C, or Ward D. Female inmates with such disabilities\nwere housed in either Sheltered Living in Module P of the\nWomen’s Jail or the infirmary. Plaintiffs’ expert witness Peter\nRobertson was permitted to tour these areas, and to take pho-\ntographs and measurements of the structures and fixtures. He\ntestified at length regarding his measurements, observations,\nand conclusions. Robertson maintained that a host of features\nand fixtures—including toilets, sinks, showers, hot water dis-\npensers, telephones, and water fountains—in cells or common\nspaces the County referred to as “accessible” did not comply\nwith federal accessibility standards.30 Since the district court’s\norder fails to specify which “architectural barriers and fea-\ntures [were] out of compliance with the ADA,” we limit our-\nselves to noting—in support of the court’s proper, but vague,\nfinding—that a number of the deficiencies reported by Rob-\nertson were conceded by Ron Bihner, the project manager\ncharged with supervising structural modifications at the\nCounty jails pursuant to the Transition Plan, and many others\nwere not explicitly disputed. Notably, Bihner agreed that the\nshowers in Wards C and D were not accessible to the\nmobility-impaired, conceded that the toilet and sink in the\nwomen’s infirmary day room were inaccessible to individuals\nin wheelchairs, and acknowledged that the rooftop exercise\n  30\n    Our references to “accessibility”—like those made by the district\ncourt and the parties—are to be construed in terms of the impairments of\nthe sub-class of mobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees. Issues of\naccessibility for those with other impairments—such as loss of hearing or\nsight—are not before us.\n   Robertson examined housing cells which the County asserted were\nintended to accommodate individuals with mobility and dexterity disabili-\nties. There was one such cell in Men’s Sheltered Living (an area dedicated\nto housing disabled detainees, which consists of eighteen cells, each hous-\ning two to four inmates), three such cells in Women’s Sheltered Living,\nand one such cell in the Women’s Infirmary. Men’s Wards C and D are\nopen dormitory-style medical wards and do not consist of discrete cells.\nRobertson also examined day rooms and other common spaces intended\nfor use by those with mobility and dexterity impairments.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5613\nand recreation areas afforded to male and female disabled\ndetainees did not offer accessible bathroom facilities.31 The\nCounty presented no evidence to dispute Robertson’s asser-\ntions that rooftop telephones and water fountains were inac-\ncessible to those in wheelchairs and that the sinks and toilets\nserving the Women’s Central Jail classroom were inaccessi-\nble, as well as facilities in other areas.32\n\n   [23] While it is evident that the district court was well-\nsupported by the record when it observed (albeit without\nspecificity) that the “existence of barriers” had been shown,\nthe district court inexplicably made further findings which are\nunsupported by and contrary to the record: The court con-\ncluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief because\nthey had not shown that “effective modifications could be\nmade,” or that “where an architectural shortcoming existed, it\nwas not made accessible by other appropriate action taken by\na jail employee.” The district court asserted broadly that\nwhere structural corrections had not been made, the County\nhad shown that “other effective remedies [were] in use.”\n  31\n      In the men’s rooftop area, for example, the bathroom facilities can\nonly be reached via a narrow doorway and stairs. The County’s Transition\nPlan did not include any plans to modify any elements or features of the\nmen’s or women’s rooftop recreation areas.\n   32\n      As we discuss further infra, the County asserted that it did not house\nmobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees in its other jail facilities—Theo\nLacy, James A. Musick, and the Intake Release Center (“IRC”). The\nCounty acknowledged, however, that disabled detainees are kept in the\nIRC’s holding cells and booking cells. Because the County did not permit\nRobertson to tour those areas, the only related evidence came from the\nstatement of a Sheriff’s Department official, Lieutenant Rick Edgmon.\nEdgmon claimed that two cells in the booking loop (one female and one\nmale) had been partially modified. At that time of this statement in July\n2003, he noted that accessible sinks had not yet been installed. Neither he\nnor other witnesses stated whether, or to what extent, any cells in the “re-\nlease section” of the IRC had been modified, as called for by the Transi-\ntion Plan.\n\f5614             PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n   To begin, we agree that plaintiffs were required to show\n“ ‘the existence of . . . reasonable accommodation[s]’ ” that\nwould enable them to make use of the facilities. Zukle, 166\nF.3d at 1046 (quoting Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 157 F.3d 744,\n749 (9th Cir. 1998)). Any finding that they did not do so is\nlegal error. Robertson’s testimony included site-specific sug-\ngestions of structural, as well as non-structural, accommoda-\ntions. He drew upon the minimum standards set out in the\nUFAS or the ADAAG for proposed structural changes, such\nas the repositioning of a sink or the replacement of controls.\nSee 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1) (requiring that structural modifi-\ncations be made in accord with the guidelines for new con-\nstruction, UFAS or ADAAG). Alternative solutions to remedy\nsome access problems were also offered. For example, Rob-\nertson noted in one instance that an inaccessible water foun-\ntain could be remedied by adding a cup dispenser rather than\nchanging the position of the fountain.\n\n   The district court found further that the County was not\nrequired to remedy structural deficiencies because “other\ncurative methods” provided disabled individuals with the req-\nuisite access. We agree, as a matter of law, that where reason-\nable alternative methods achieve compliance, structural\nchanges to existing facilities need not be made. 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.150(b)(1). However, there is no support for the court’s\nconclusion that such methods were shown to cure the many\nstructural deficiencies in this case.\n\n   The only deficiencies that were shown to be addressed by\nalternate methods were small surface-elevation changes—i.e.,\nridges or curbs—that otherwise posed obstacles to movement\nbetween locations. Robertson observed, for example, that a\nfive-inch curb obstructed access to the women’s rooftop rec-\nreation area. He testified that this could be overcome by hav-\ning a trained deputy guide a wheelchair over the curb. The\nrecord supports the conclusion that deputies, in fact, do this,\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5615\nand plaintiffs are not denied access to the rooftop or other\nlocations because of these surface irregularities.33\n\n   The County did not present evidence, as the district court’s\nbroad finding asserts, that other deficiencies were remedied\nthrough the assistance of deputies or by “other curative meth-\nods.” Plaintiffs, on the other hand, presented evidence to show\nthat deficiencies were not remedied. Robertson testified, for\nexample, that he observed detainees—not deputies—\nstruggling to lift a fellow wheelchair-bound detainee over a\nfoot-high retention wall in one of Ward C’s inaccessible\nshowers. Conn also testified that he was forced to rely on fel-\nlow inmates for assistance when faced with inaccessible bath-\nroom facilities.34\n\n   The impediment posed by such a barrier highlights the\ninadequacy of deputy or other inmate assistance. The County\nmaintained throughout the trial that the deputies have their\nhands full given the ratio of deputies to inmates and the vari-\nous duties incumbent upon the former. Staffing limits make\nit unreasonable to expect to address all structural deficiencies\nthrough deputy assistance.\n\n   The County argues that the district court’s holding should,\nin any event, be affirmed because plaintiffs failed to satisfy\ntheir burden under Turner. We disagree. Even under Turner,\nthe County was required to proffer some reason for its policy\n  33\n      County policies require deputies to transport wheelchair-bound detain-\nees between locations—that is, between their cells and other areas, such\nas the day room, rooftop, or chapel. (In other words, deputies push the\nwheelchairs, rather than allowing the detainees to propel themselves, as\nthey do once they have arrived at a given location.)\n   34\n      While examining Robertson and Bihner, counsel for the County asked\nwhether, in certain instances, assistance from deputies or other non-\nstructural solutions might adequately accommodate individuals with dis-\nabilities. We pause to note the obvious—that such questions and answers\nmay establish that a reasonable accommodation is possible, but do not\nshow that it is practical or has been implemented.\n\f5616                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nor practice. See Armstrong ‘01, 275 F.3d at 874. The County\ndid not posit any legitimate rationale for maintaining inacces-\nsible bathrooms, sinks, showers, and other fixtures in the\nhousing areas and commons spaces assigned to mobility- and\ndexterity impaired detainees.35 The vague assertion by the\nCounty’s counsel that some accommodations might be costly\ncannot be construed as a legitimate basis for failing to comply\nwith the ADA (whether through structural modifications or\nother reasonable methods). See id.; Walker, 917 F.2d at 386.\n\n   [24] We conclude that the district court erred in denying\nrelief because it based its conclusion on clearly erroneous fac-\ntual findings. Accordingly, we remand for further proceed-\nings.\n\n       b.   Integration and access to programs and services.\n\n   Plaintiffs also argued that, by virtue of being housed exclu-\nsively in the Men’s and Women’s Central Jails, they were\ndenied access to a variety of programs, activities, and services\nfor which they would otherwise be eligible. Plaintiffs essen-\ntially advanced two arguments: First, they challenged the\nCounty’s policy of segregating disabled detainees, rather than\nallowing them to reside, recreate, and consume meals in inte-\ngrated settings. Second, they argued that, regardless of where\nthey are housed, the County had not “operate[d] each service,\nprogram, or activity so that the service, program, or activity,\nwhen viewed in its entirety, [was] readily accessible to and\nusable by individuals with disabilities,” as required by 28\nC.F.R. § 35.150(a).\n\n  The district court rejected plaintiffs’ claims. First, the court\nconcluded that the segregation of disabled detainees was rea-\n  35\n     We note the one exception discussed supra. We agree that the Coun-\nty’s policy with regard to small level changes—eschewing structural mod-\nification in favor of another reasonable method of achieving compliance—\nwas not shown to be unreasonable.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                      5617\nsonably related to legitimate interests, and therefore declined\nto order mainstreaming. Second, the court found that “the evi-\ndence shows that, except for the ‘Best Choice’ Program, the\nvarious inmate programs are also available to disabled\ninmates,” and concluded that this was reasonable. The exclu-\nsion of disabled inmates from the Best Choice Program, a\ndrug rehabilitation program, was deemed reasonable in light\nof security concerns.\n\n   [25] We do not find error in the district court’s ruling\nregarding mainstreaming. Sheriff’s Department officials testi-\nfied at some length regarding the security concerns related to\nhousing mobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees with non-\ndisabled detainees. The district court’s finding that plaintiffs\ndid not refute this evidence is not clearly erroneous.\n\n   [26] The district court’s finding that disabled inmates had\naccess to all programs, save the Best Choice program, cannot,\nhowever, be squared with the record.36 As we mentioned ear-\nlier, as of 2004, disabled detainees with mobility and dexterity\nimpairments were not housed in the County’s James A. Mus-\nick Facility or Theo Lacy Facility.37 The testimony of Sher-\niff’s Department officials revealed that Theo Lacy and\nMusick offered a variety of programs, services, and activities\nwhich were not available to inmates of the Men’s and\n  36\n      The district court’s decision speaks only of “inmate programs” and\nmakes no mention of “services” or “activities” offered by the County jails.\nIt is impossible to say whether the court considered the full breadth of\nplaintiffs’ claims (which included services and activities). We assume, for\npurposes of our review, that the court intended to include, and thereby\nreject, plaintiffs’ claim as it related to services and activities.\n   37\n      According to the County, Musick does not offer accessible in-custody\nfacilities. (The Transition Plan only provided for modifications to Mus-\nick’s public and visitor areas.) Theo Lacy, which houses male detainees,\nwas substantially renovated in the late 1990s. County and Sheriff’s\nDepartment officials asserted at trial that a new Sheltered Living module\nfor men was built, but had not yet been staffed due to budgetary con-\nstraints.\n\f5618              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nWomen’s Central Jails. For example, programs in agriculture,\nwoodworking, and welding were among the vocational oppor-\ntunities available at Musick or Theo Lacy, but not available\nat the Central Jail Complex. In addition, detainees at Musick\nand Theo Lacy were afforded opportunities to participate in\noff-site or community work projects. The recreational oppor-\ntunities available at Musick or Theo Lacy—where inmates\nhad access to a softball field, volleyball courts, pool tables,\nand other indoor and outdoor facilities—also exceeded those\nprovided at the Central Jail Complex.\n\n   The Central Jail Complex houses both disabled and non-\ndisabled detainees. However, non-disabled detainees retain at\nleast the possibility of access to the programs offered at Mus-\nick and Theo Lacy, while disabled detainees—solely by virtue\nof their status as disabled—have no possibility of access to\nthe superior services offered outside of the Central Jail Com-\nplex. The ADA does not require perfect parity among pro-\ngrams offered by various facilities that are operated by the\nsame umbrella institution. But an inmate cannot be categori-\ncally excluded from a beneficial prison program based on his\nor her disability alone. Yeskey, 524 U.S. at 210 (“Modern pris-\nons provide inmates with many recreational ‘activities,’ medi-\ncal ‘services,’ and educational and vocational ‘programs,’ all\nof which at least theoretically ‘benefit’ the prisoners (and any\nof which disabled prisoners could be ‘excluded from partici-\npation in’).”). Moreover, ADA regulations contemplate “reas-\nsignment of services to accessible buildings,” as a permissible\nmeans of accommodation. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1). The\nCounty would not have to make Musick and Theo Lacy phys-\nically or structurally ADA compliant. It might consider, for\nexample, redistributing some programs available at those two\nfacilities to make them available at the Central Jail so that\nwhen “viewed in [their] entirety” the County’s programs are\n“readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabili-\nties.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a). But the County may not shunt\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5619\nthe disabled into facilities where there is no possibility of\naccess to those programs.38\n\n   While the County need not make all of its existing facilities\naccessible to individuals with or without disabilities, it is\nexpected to provide “program access.” 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App.\nA. Any type of educational, vocational, rehabilitative, or rec-\nreational program, service, or activity offered to nondisabled\ndetainees should, when viewed in its entirety, be similarly\navailable to disabled detainees who, with or without reason-\nable accommodations, meet the essential eligibility require-\nments to participate. Whether this “program access” standard\nmay reasonably be met or whether any restriction on access\nis reasonably related to a legitimate government objective is\nnecessarily fact-specific. We also emphasize that the district\ncourt should look at the offerings as a whole and in their\nentirety and thus the court is not required to ensure that each\nindividual program or service offered at Theo Lacy and Mus-\n   38\n      There is no clear case authority on this precise point—whether the\nADA permits an umbrella organization to exclude the disabled from par-\nticular facilities with superior programs and services, so long as there is\none accessible facility with inferior programs. But at least one district\ncourt has noted, in the context of school programs, that there is a “discrim-\ninatory effect” when disabled students are discouraged from “attempting\nto participate in classes and other programs located in inaccessible facili-\nties.” Putnam v. Oakland Unified School Dist., 1995 WL 973734 at *10,\n15 A.D.D. 1361 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 9, 1995). There are, of course, security\nconcerns in a prison system that are not present in a high school system,\nbut the concerns associated with inequalities between different facilities\ninhere in both scenarios. While a court should be “hesitant to second-\nguess” a “good faith accessibility plan,” here there is no plan to make any\nof the services available at Musick and Theo Lacy accessible to disabled\ninmates housed at Central Jail. Id. Thus, while the County has consider-\nable discretion under the regulations to determine whether and how it can\nextend program accessibility, it cannot simply do nothing. Id. (“For exam-\nple, upon determining that none of its schools was accessible with respect\nto all necessary and unique facilities, the District might have decided to\nmake some of its high school campuses partially accessible, in such a way\nas to make all the Districts’ programs accessible at those campuses.”).\n\f5620                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nick is offered in complete parity with an offering at the Cen-\ntral Jail.\n\n   [27] The County has offered no explanation or justification,\neither in district court or on appeal, for the significant differ-\nences between the vocational and recreational activities avail-\nable at Theo Lacy and Musick, and those available to either\nable or disabled detainees at the Central Jail. As such, the\nCounty has not raised the defense that a policy of restricting\naccess to these programs, services, or activities is reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate government objective. See Armstrong\n‘01, 275 F.3d at 874. We conclude that the district court erred\nwhen it concluded that disabled inmates had access to “the\nvarious inmate programs,” and we must remand as further\nfact-finding is required to determine what relief is appropriate.39\nIn particular, the district court should examine the feasibility\nof offering similar programs at the Central Jail, and the extent\nto which the programs offered at Theo Lacy or Musick are\ncapable of being offered at the Central Jail without eliminat-\ning those programs at Theo Lacy or Musick. There may be\nother appropriate remedies that provide disabled inmates\naccess to programs and services, and the district court should\nconsider those options as well. Our intention is not to suggest\nor cause the termination or diminution of programs or facili-\nties other than the Central Jail, but to have the district court\nexplore available options on a full evidentiary record.\n\n       c.   The district court’s unsupported assumption that\n            the County would “move toward” full compliance\n            was clearly erroneous.\n\n  The district court determined that the County was not in\ncompliance with the ADA, but took it on faith that the County\n  39\n   We do not disturb the district court’s ruling with regard to the Best\nChoice Program but do require the district court to determine whether and\nhow security is a problem and to determine whether other programs at the\nCentral Jail offer similar or essentially equivalent programs.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5621\nwould “move toward full compliance.” This conclusion is\nunwarranted given the County’s track record. The County\nadopted its Transition Plan for structural changes in August\n2000—eight years after the deadline set by the regulations for\nsuch plans, and five and a half years after the regulations’\ndeadline for the completion of structural modifications.40 Fur-\nthermore, when ultimately adopted, the Plan failed to address\nmany architectural barriers in common spaces used by dis-\nabled detainees (for example, those on the rooftop of the\nMen’s and Women’s Jails). Diane DeHaas, the Orange\nCounty ADA Title II Coordinator, testified that the work\nunder the Transition Plan had been completed, and spoke of\nno particular plans to remedy any of the glaring deficiencies.\n\n   The County has done even less to ensure that disabled\ndetainees are given opportunities to benefit from the various\nprograms, activities, and services offered by the jails. While\nTitle II regulations require that the County complete a self-\nevaluation regarding the availability of programs, activities,\nand services, see 28 C.F.R § 35.105(a), DeHaas conceded that\nshe did not know whether it had been done for the County\njails. Moreover, she admitted that she had no information\nabout whether disabled detainees could have access to educa-\ntional programs or a variety of other services.\n\n   In any event, neither the fact that Orange County might\nmove toward compliance nor the district court’s belief that it\nwould do so eventually constituted a proper basis for denying\nplaintiffs relief. We must remand so that the district court can\nengage in further fact-finding, consistent with our opinion, to\ndetermine what relief should be granted. We note that several\nyears have passed since the trial was held, and, as a result,\n  40\n    Further, Ron Bihner testified that the adoption of the Plan was not on\nthe County’s initiative but rather was prompted by a declaratory relief case\nbrought in Orange County Superior Court, Blaser v. Orange County, No.\n78892.\n\f5622               PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\ndetermining what prospective relief is warranted may require\nconsideration of any significantly changed facts.41\n\n  Finally, the district court’s Final Pierce Order did not\naddress plaintiffs’ claims that they were denied adequate\nnotice of their rights under the ADA and an appropriate griev-\nance procedure, as required by the regulations. See 28 C.F.R.\n§§ 35.106, 35.107. On remand, the district court also should\nmake findings on these issues.\n\n       d.   Claims for mental and emotional harms.\n\n   Prior to trial the district court granted summary judgment\nto Orange County on plaintiffs’ claims for mental and emo-\ntional harms. We conclude that decision was in error as it\nrelated to two specific allegations advanced by plaintiff Timo-\nthy Conn.\n\n   [28] According to plaintiffs’ complaint, Conn alleged that\nthe County failed to adequately accommodate his disability in\nviolation of the ADA, and that he suffered physical injuries,\nas well as mental and emotional distress, as a result. The dis-\ntrict court’s March 1, 2004 order held that these alleged inju-\nries were merely de minimis, and therefore precluded by the\nPLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), from giving rise to any cogniza-\nble claim under the ADA for compensatory damages. The\nPLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), states, “No Federal civil action\nmay be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suf-\nfered while in custody without a prior showing of physical\ninjury.” See Oliver, 289 F.3d at 626-27 (concluding that\n§ 1997e(e) requires a “showing of physical injury that need\nnot be significant but must be more than de minimis.”).\n  41\n    Whether or not disabled detainees are now housed in Theo Lacy will\nobviously be pertinent to the district court’s inquiry.\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5623\n   Conn challenges the district court’s determination, arguing\nthat § 1997e(e) does not apply to claims under the ADA and\nthat his injuries were in any case more than de minimis. While\nthe former argument is unpersuasive in light of the plain lan-\nguage of § 1997e(e),42 the latter argument compels our rever-\nsal of the district court’s decision with regard to two of\nConn’s allegations.\n\n   [29] Conn alleged that during his detention in 2000-2001\nhe was denied an adequate supply of catheters, and as a result\nsuffered recurrent bladder infections. He also alleged that he\nwas not provided a proper mattress given his disability, and\nas a result developed bed sores. Neither of these injuries is de\nminimis. Both bladder infections and bed sores pose signifi-\ncant pain and health risks to paraplegics like Conn.43 Our\ncourt has rejected as overly restrictive the standard for de\nminimis injuries espoused by the Northern District of Texas\nin Luong v. Hatt, 979 F. Supp. 481 (N.D. Tex, 1997), which\nrequires “ ‘an observable or diagnosable medical condition\nrequiring treatment by a medical care professional,’ which\nwould cause a ‘free world person’ to seek such treatment.”\nOliver, 289 F.3d at 628. We have maintained that if allowing\nclaims for de minimis injuries requires too little of plaintiffs,\n  42\n      Plaintiffs have offered no reasoned basis for carving out an exception\nfor ADA claims. They point to our holding in Armstrong v. Davis, 318\nF.3d 965 (9th Cir. 2003), that § 1997e(d)(3)’s cap on awards of attorneys\nfees authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1988 does not apply to the successful liti-\ngation of ADA claims, and maintain that § 1997e(e) is analogous. Section\n1997e(e), however, does not include language similar to that which is\nfound in subsection (d)(3) constraining its application. Moreover, in Arm-\nstrong we explicitly declined to look to other provisions of the PLRA in\ninterpreting § 1997e(d)(3). Id. at 974 n.9; see also Cassidy v. Indiana\nDep’t of Corr., 199 F.3d 374, 376 (7th Cir. 2000) (rejecting a similar argu-\nment).\n   43\n      The physical injury requirement directs the court to consider the injury\nsuffered by an individual and not the degree of force used by the state to\ninflict the injury. See Oliver, 289 F.3d at 628. Where, as here, the com-\nplainant is a paraplegic, particular injuries pose different, and possibly\nmore substantial, risks than they might to an average prisoner.\n\f5624                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nthis standard requires too much. Id. Yet notably, Conn’s\nalleged bed sores and bladder infections clear even that strin-\ngent standard. Both constitute “ ‘observable or diagnosable\nmedical conditions’ ” that would lead a person to seek treat-\nment. See id.44 In sum, these claims were improperly dis-\nmissed, and we remand to the district court for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nE.     The district court did not err in rejecting plaintiffs’\n       equal protection claims.\n\n   Finally, the disabled plaintiffs argue that the district court\nimproperly rejected the equal protection claim brought by the\nsub-class of mobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees. After\nreviewing the district court’s November 2004 ruling de novo,\nsee Buono v. Norton, 371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir. 2004), we\naffirm the grant of summary judgment.\n\n   The district court considered whether plaintiffs could estab-\nlish that they were treated differently from how similarly situ-\nated prisoners are treated. This is the first step in a successful\nequal protection claim based on disability. See McGowan v.\nMaryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425 (1961); Williamson v. Lee Opti-\ncal of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 490 (1955). “Because\n‘the disabled do not constitute a suspect class’ for equal pro-\ntection purposes, a governmental policy that purposefully\ntreats the disabled differently from the non-disabled need only\nbe ‘rationally related to legitimate legislative goals’ to pass\n  44\n    On appeal, the County urges us to affirm the district court on other\ngrounds. The County argues that, even if Conn’s alleged injuries were not\nde minimis, his claims would not have been actionable under the ADA.\nWe disagree. Providing inmates with appropriate and adequate bedding\nand bathroom facilities are “services” of the jail. The fact that Conn’s\nrequired “bathroom facilities” included catheters does not change the anal-\nysis. The jail was required to provide him with an adequate and appropri-\nate means of relieving himself. There is still an issue as to whether he was\nprovided adequate toilet facilities because the expert, Robertson, testified\nthat the grab bar is still not properly positioned.\n\f                   PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                  5625\nconstitutional muster.” Lee, 250 F.3d at 687 (quoting Does 1-\n5 v. Chandler, 83 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 1996)). However,\nthe court’s assertion that “disabled and nondisabled detainees\nare not similarly situated for equal-protection purposes” is an\noverstatement. Disabled and nondisabled detainees may be\nsimilarly situated in some instances. See, e.g., More v. Far-\nrier, 984 F.2d 269, 270-71 (8th Cir. 1993) (finding that\nwheelchair-bound inmates and nondisabled inmates were\nequally capable of watching television without assistance, and\ntherefore were similarly situated with regard to the installation\nof cable television); see also City of Cleburne v. Cleburne\nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985) (“The State may not\nrely on a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal\nis so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irratio-\nnal.”).\n\n   [30] Nonetheless, we conclude that the district court’s hold-\ning was proper, given the case presented by the plaintiffs.\nPlaintiffs’ allegations in support of their equal protection\nclaim did not show that they were treated differently from\nsimilarly situated prisoners. For example, although plaintiffs\nalleged that paraplegic and quadriplegic detainees were kept\nin holding cells without accessible toilets and sinks, they did\nnot allege that the County accommodated the special needs of\nany other group with regard to toilet or sink access. While\nthese allegations implicate the County’s ADA obligations,\nthey do not, without more, implicate equal protection con-\ncerns.\n\n                       VI.    CONCLUSION\n\n   We affirm all of the district court’s pre-trial management\nand evidentiary rulings challenged on appeal. We conclude\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in consolidat-\ning the Pierce action with the Stewart decree proceeding. We\nfurther hold in respect to the trial that the district court did not\nviolate the Pierce plaintiffs’ due process rights by limiting the\n\f5626              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nlength of the trial, nor do we find reversible error in its evi-\ndentiary rulings.\n\n   As to the claim that the district court lacked authority on its\nown to terminate the orders in the Stewart decree, we con-\nclude that the County, in effect, moved for the termination.\nThe parties consented to the consolidation and briefed the\nissues relating to the continuing viability of orders in the\nStewart decree. Accordingly, we hold that the district court\nhad the requisite authority.\n\n   On the merits, of the fourteen Stewart orders under review,\nwe concur in the termination of all but two of those orders,\nand grant plaintiffs corresponding injunctive relief under\n§ 1983 related to those two orders. We grant relief under\n§ 1983 for the violation of the rights of inmates held in\nadministrative segregation to access to religious services and\nhold that they are entitled to injunctive relief. We hold further\nthat the Stewart order on the provision of religious services\nmay not be terminated. We grant relief under § 1983 to\ninmates in administrative segregation for violation of their\nright to constitutionally protected exercise and hold that they\nare entitled to injunctive relief. We hold further that the Stew-\nart order requiring exercise for inmates in administrative seg-\nregation, subject to that order’s safety-valve provision\npermitting the County to curtail or eliminate exercise for\ninmates that become violent or disruptive, may not be termi-\nnated.\n\n   As to the claims of disabled inmates, although we hold\nthere is no equal protection violation inherent in the disparate\ntreatment of those detainees, we conclude that the County has\nviolated the ADA. Accordingly, we grant relief to disabled\nprisoners on their ADA claims as follows: (a) The district\ncourt must conduct further fact finding on the current state of\nphysical barriers to adequate access to bathrooms, showers,\nexercise areas, day rooms, dining rooms, cells and all other\nareas to which disabled persons should have access and order\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                 5627\nremedial remedies as required; (b) The district court must\nconduct further fact finding as to the programs and activities\ndisabled persons currently have access to and order such\nremedial measures as required to make the County’s provision\nof programs and services, when viewed in their entirety,\naccessible to mobility- and dexterity-impaired inmates.\n\n   Finally, we conclude that Conn suffered physical injuries\nthat were not de minimis as a result of inadequacies in jail\nfacilities. The district court thus erred in dismissing his claims\nof mental and emotional harms. We remand those claims for\nfurther proceedings.\n\n AFFIRMED          IN    PART,     REVERSED         IN    PART,\nREMANDED.\n\f5628             PIERCE v.

We also emphasize\n    that the district court should look at the offerings as\n    a whole and in their entirety and thus the court is not\n\f5570             PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n    required to ensure that each individual program or\n    service offered at Theo Lacy and Musick is offered\n    in complete parity with an offering at the Central\n    Jail.\n\n  (2) At 519 F.3d at 1016, delete the sentence reading, “In\nparticular, the district court should examine the extent to\nwhich the programs offered at Theo Lacy and Musick are\ncapable of reassignment to the Central Jail without eliminat-\ning those programs at Theo Lacy or Musick.” Replace the\ndeleted sentence with the following three sentences:\n\n    In particular, the district court should examine the\n    feasibility of offering similar programs at the Central\n    Jail, and the extent to which the programs offered at\n    Theo Lacy or Musick are capable of being offered at\n    the Central Jail without eliminating those programs\n    at Theo Lacy or Musick. There may be other appro-\n    priate remedies that provide disabled inmates access\n    to programs and services, and the district court\n    should consider those options as well. Our intention\n    is not to suggest or cause the termination or diminu-\n    tion of programs or facilities other than the Central\n    Jail, but to have the district court explore available\n    options on a full evidentiary record.\n\n   Judges McKeown and Bybee have voted to deny the peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc, and Judge Fletcher has so recom-\nmended.

FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   In 2001, plaintiffs-appellants Fred Pierce, Timothy Lee\nConn, Fermin Valenzuela, and Laurie D. Ellerston—pretrial\ndetainees in Orange County’s jail facilities—initiated Pierce\nv. County of Orange, No. 05-55829 (D. Ct. No. 01-981), a\nclass action suit against the County of Orange and Michael S.\nCarona, the county’s sheriff and agent.1 Seeking relief under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process rights, plaintiffs contend, in essence, that\nthe Orange County jails are operated in an unconstitutional\nmanner, depriving them of opportunities for exercise, unduly\nlimiting their access to common areas, and impermissibly\nrestricting their ability to practice religion. Plaintiffs further\nassert that they have been deprived of a number of the federal\nrights previously recognized in Stewart v. Gates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1819852\"><a href=\"/opinion/1819852/stewart-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (C.D. Cal. 1978) (“Stewart”)—a decision and resulting\ninjunctive orders (“the Stewart orders” or “the Stewart injunc-\ntion”) that established standards for pretrial detention in\nOrange County jails. The plaintiffs seek relief for the same\ninjuries under the California Constitution, as well as Title 15\nof the California Code of Regulations (which sets minimum\nstandards for county jails) in violation of § 815.6 of the Cali-\nfornia Government Code, and breach of § 54.1 of the Califor-\nnia Civil Code. Finally, the plaintiffs in Pierce assert an equal\nprotection claim under § 1983 based on the denial of equal\ntreatment to disabled detainees, and they advance a separate\nclaim for violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabili-\nties Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., alleging non-\ncompliant jail facilities and denial of access to programs and\nservices available to non-disabled detainees. On appeal, the\n  1\n   Plaintiffs’ claims against Carona were dismissed, leaving the County\nas the sole defendant-appellee involved in this consolidated appeal. In a\nseparate order, we grant Carona’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ appeal\nas untimely with respect to him.\n\f5572               PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nplaintiffs also challenge a number of the district court’s pre-\ntrial procedural and evidentiary rulings.\n\n   After a six day trial, the district court found that the plain-\ntiffs had failed to establish any constitutional injury giving\nrise to relief under § 1983. The district court went on to find\nthat the fourteen Stewart orders at issue were no longer neces-\nsary, and ordered them all terminated pursuant to the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (“PLRA”),2 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).\nThe district court likewise rejected plaintiffs’ equal protection\nand ADA claims, finding that although the County was not in\n“full ADA compliance, [ ] it can reasonably be expected to\nmove toward full compliance.”\n\n   Having conducted a thorough review of the extensive pre-\ntrial and trial record, we affirm in part and reverse in part. We\naffirm the district court’s pre-trial and evidentiary rulings\nchallenged by the plaintiffs; the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in its pre-trial management of the case or its deci-\nsions related to the admission of evidence. On the merits, we\naffirm the district court’s termination of nearly all of the four-\nteen Stewart orders at issue. Two of those orders, however,\nwhich secure inmates housed in administrative segregation\nsome minimal access to religious services and exercise, may\nnot be terminated. The district court clearly erred in its find-\ning that these two orders are unnecessary to correct a current\nand ongoing violation of a Federal right. We likewise con-\nclude that, because of physical barriers that deny disabled\ninmates access to certain prison facilities (bathrooms, show-\ners, exercise and other common areas), and because of dispa-\nrate programs and services offered to disabled versus non-\ndisabled inmates, the County is in violation of the ADA.\n  2\n   Pub.

Gates was commenced in 1975 when a class of\npretrial detainees challenged the constitutionality of various\npractices and conditions of confinement in the Orange County\nCentral Jail in Santa Ana, California. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1819852\"><a href=\"/opinion/1819852/stewart-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\nCal. 1978). In 1978, the district court presiding over the case\nissued an injunction, establishing various standards for pre-\ntrial detention. Id. at 590-91 (holding that the court retained\njurisdiction to modify the orders upon a showing of good\ncause). In 1991, the district court made clear that the order\napplied to all of the Orange County jails: Men’s Central Jail,\nWomen’s Central Jail, Intake Release Center, James A. Mus-\nick Facility, and Theo Lacy Facility.\n\n    The Stewart orders—which have been modified in the\nyears since the initial injunction was issued—address detain-\nees’ access to telephones, law books, reading materials, and\ninterjail mail to jailhouse lawyers; provide for mattresses,\nbeds, and blankets; establish mealtimes and sleeptimes;\nrequire seating while awaiting transport to and from court;\nand set population caps. The orders also address several issues\npertaining specifically to inmates in administrative segrega-\ntion: their access to religious services, day rooms, exercise,\nand visitors.3 The Stewart orders subject to challenge in this\nlitigation are reproduced as Appendix A to this opinion. Spe-\ncifically, plaintiffs in Pierce maintain that they have been sub-\n  3\n    Administrative segregation applies to inmates “who are determined to\nbe prone to: escape; assault staff or other inmates; disrupt the operations\nof the jail, or likely to need protection from other inmates.” Cal. Code\nRegs. Tit. 15, § 1053. This encompasses the definitions of both Adminis-\ntrative Segregation and Protective Custody. According to the testimony of\nCounty witness Sergeant Rich Himmel, inmates who have “violent ten-\ndencies and have been deemed a threat to Department staff or other\ninmates,” are classified as “Administrative Segregation.”\n\f5574                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\njected to holding-cell conditions deemed unconstitutional in\nStewart and have been denied the minimum mealtime held to\nbe constitutionally required in Stewart. In addition, plaintiffs\ncontend that inmates housed in administrative segregation are\ndenied the minimum access to religious services, the day\nroom, and exercise that Stewart held to be constitutionally\nrequired. Plaintiffs sought relief for the alleged violations pur-\nsuant to § 1983. Attacking the same conduct, plaintiffs also\nallege due process violations under the California Constitu-\ntion, breach of mandatory duties under Title 15 of the Califor-\nnia Code of Regulations (which sets minimum standards for\ncounty jails) in violation of § 815.6 of the California Govern-\nment Code, and breach of § 54.1 of the California Civil Code.\n\n   The County, meanwhile, sought termination of the Stewart\norders in their entirety pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b), a sec-\ntion of the PLRA that allows a court to terminate prospective\ninjunctive relief governing prison conditions on a showing\nthat the injunction is no longer needed to correct a current and\nongoing violation of a Federal right.\n\nB.     Equal protection and ADA violations.\n\n   Plaintiffs in Pierce assert an equal protection claim under\n§ 1983 based on the denial of equal treatment to disabled\ndetainees, and they advance a separate claim for violations of\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. § 12131 et seq. Plaintiffs maintain that the County has\nviolated the ADA by failing to address numerous structural\nbarriers, such as inaccessible bathroom facilities,4 and failing\nto provide adequate access to various programs offered by the\nCounty’s jails.\n\n  One of the plaintiff inmates, Timothy Conn, claimed to\nhave suffered physical injuries, as well as mental and emo-\n  4\n   The particular architectural features at issue are discussed in greater\ndetail infra Section V.D.3.a.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5575\ntional harms, because of the County’s failure to accommodate\nhis disability. Conn is wheelchair-bound and alleged that he\nsuffered recurrent bladder infections because the County\nfailed to provide him with an adequate supply of catheters.\nConn also claimed to have developed bed sores that were\nexacerbated when he was forced to sit on a holding cell\nbench, and eventually required surgery. The district court dis-\nmissed Conn’s claims on summary judgment prior to trial on\nthe grounds that they were “de minimis” and thus not action-\nable pursuant to the PLRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).\n\n                     II.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.     Class certification.\n\n   In August 2003, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certifica-\ntion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and\n23(b)(3)5 of a “main class” of pretrial detainees who had been\nheld in Orange County jails after October 21, 2001 and had\nexperienced violations of certain rights enumerated in Stew-\nart, as well as certification of a “sub-class” of disabled detain-\nees who had been denied rights under the ADA. Plaintiffs’\nmotion was granted on October 15, 2003.\n\n     In January 2004, Orange County filed a motion to decertify\n  5\n   According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), a class action\nmay be maintained when the prerequisites under subsection (a) of the rule\nare satisfied (i.e., numerosity, commonality, typicality, and representative-\nness), and “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds that generally apply to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n   If subsection (a) is satisfied, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3)\nprovides that a class action may be maintained where “the court finds that\nthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over\nany questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action\nis superior to other available methods fairly and efficiently adjudicating\nthe controversy.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n\f5576                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nthe class. The district court ruled on the motion on March 1,\n2004, holding that certification as an “equitable relief class”\nremained proper under Rule 23(b)(2), but that certification as\na “damages class” under Rule 23(b)(3) was inappropriate.\nSpecifically, the court rejected plaintiffs’ proposed proof of\n“aggregated damages” by relying on “statistical sampling to\ndetermine the proper amount of damages.” Plaintiffs’ counsel\nsubsequently waived nominal damages on behalf of the\nnamed plaintiffs. It was agreed at a status conference on\nMarch 5, 2004, that the case would proceed to a bench trial\nas an equitable relief class without claims for damages.\n\n   In November 2004, the district court clarified the scope of\nclass membership based on ADA violations. The court ruled\nthat “ADA disability evidence [would] be limited to condi-\ntions applicable to Plaintiff Conn [a wheelchair-bound named\nplaintiff] and persons having a disability similar to his.”6\n\nB.     Summary judgment on claims for mental and\n       emotional injury.\n\n   The district court’s March 1, 2004 decertification order\nseparately granted summary judgment to Orange County on\nplaintiffs’ claims for mental and emotional injuries. The dis-\ntrict court concluded that the PLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e),\nbars plaintiffs’ recovery for mental or emotional injury unless\nthere is a showing of non-de minimis physical injury. The\ncourt found that plaintiffs’ claims of relevant physical injuries\nwere all de minimis, except for one incident involving plain-\ntiff Conn not at issue here.7\n  6\n     Conn is described in the record as a paraplegic or incomplete quadri-\nplegic, meaning that he has no mobility in his lower body and some, albeit\nlimited, use of his upper body. The parties agree that the subclass consists\nof mobility- and dexterity-impaired inmates.\n   7\n     The court held that Conn could recover for mental and emotional dam-\nages arising directly from this incident—a van accident. This one claim\nwas bifurcated and ultimately settled in 2005.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                5577\nC.   Consolidation of Pierce with review of the Stewart\n     orders.\n\n   On March 11, 2004, the district court sua sponte ordered\nthat Pierce, the plaintiffs’ affirmative suit, be consolidated\nwith Stewart, over which the same district court had jurisdic-\ntion. According to the district court, the issue of the continu-\ning viability of the Stewart injunction had come up indirectly\n“in various different ways” in the Pierce litigation, and the\ncourt concluded that “rather than beat around the bush, [the\ncourt] need[ed] to just deal with these issues direct[ly].” The\ncourt explained that it would “receive evidence whether exist-\ning Stewart orders should be revised, updated, modified,\nexpanded, and/or vacated” at the trial already scheduled in\nPierce. The parties did not object to the consolidation, and\nproceeded to brief the court on the relevant developments in\nthe law in the years since Stewart was first decided.\n\nD.   Summary judgment on equal protection claims.\n\n   On November 2, 2004, the district court granted Orange\nCounty’s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ equal\nprotection claim in Pierce. The court reasoned that disabled\ndetainees were required to show that they were treated differ-\nently than other similarly situated prisoners, and had not satis-\nfied the summary judgment standard for doing so. In the same\norder, the district court also held that plaintiffs’ requests in\nPierce for injunctive relief for non-ADA-related claims (to\nredress issues of mealtimes; holding cell conditions; and\naccess to religious services, the day room, and exercise) were\nmoot, in light of the then-existing injunctions in Stewart. In\nshort, the court ruled that the question of injunctive relief for\nthe non-ADA claims in Pierce would be addressed under the\nconsolidated Stewart caption. The court held that declaratory\nrelief remained available.\n\nE.   Evidentiary and trial management rulings.\n\n   At a pretrial conference in early November 2004, the dis-\ntrict court announced that each side would be allowed three\n\f5578              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\ndays to present its case. Plaintiffs filed a written objection to\nthe time limit on due process grounds. The objection was\noverruled, and a six-day bench trial was held, with each side\nreceiving equal time. At trial, the district court adhered to its\nprior order on time limitations, advising counsel when time\nwas running short.\n\n   The district court also ruled against the plaintiffs and in the\nCounty’s favor on a number of evidentiary issues. First, the\ndistrict court barred the admission of a survey of inmates\nregarding jail conditions conducted by plaintiffs’ expert, Dr.\nNadereh Pourat (“Pourat Survey”). Second, the district court\nruled that plaintiffs could not submit deposition testimony of\nclass members who were in prisons more than 100 miles from\nthe courthouse, on the grounds that such witnesses were not\n“unavailable.” Third, the district court allowed the County to\nintroduce statements by absent class members as admissions\nby party-opponents.\n\n                             *   *    *\n\n   Trial was held during the first week of December, 2004. On\nApril 27, 2005, the district court issued two final orders—an\n“Order Vacating Earlier Orders and Dismissing Case in Stew-\nart” (“Stewart Final Order”), and “Findings of Fact and Con-\nclusions of Law in Pierce” (“Pierce Final Order”). The\nStewart Final Order vacated all of the injunctive orders in\nStewart after finding that each was either “inappropriate” or\n“unnecessary.” The Pierce Final Order also rejected in their\nentirety plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims based on prison conditions\nand practices, either on the ground that the County had not\nviolated a Federal right, or that there was no evidence of a\npolicy or custom of violations. The court also held that the\nCounty was not liable for violations of the ADA.\n\n                      III.   JURISDICTION\n\n  The district court had jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343. 28 U.S.C. § 1367 con-\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE               5579\nferred jurisdiction over state claims. We have subject matter\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n     IV.   TRIAL MANAGEMENT AND EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n   Plaintiffs appeal a number of the district court’s pre-trial\nrulings related to case management and the admission of evi-\ndence. We affirm each of the district court’s rulings on these\nissues.\n\nA.   The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n     limiting the trial to six days or by de-certifying the\n     “damages class.”\n\n   Plaintiffs argue that their due process rights were violated\nwhen they were given only three days to present their consoli-\ndated case in Pierce and Stewart. Plaintiffs in Pierce also con-\ntend that the court erred when it decertified their so-called\n“damages class.” We review both decisions for abuse of dis-\ncretion. See Navellier v. Sletten, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774653\"><a href=\"/opinion/774653/louis-g-navellier-an-individual-and-trustee-and-shareholder-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 941 (9th Cir.\n2001) (challenges to trial court management and denial of\nclass certification reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n\n   [1] First, although plaintiffs assert generally that they did\nnot have adequate time to address the factual issues in Pierce\nand Stewart, we conclude that they have not shown that “there\nwas harm incurred as a result” of the time limit. Monotype\nCorp. v. Int’l Typeface Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451 (9th Cir.\n1994). Plaintiffs objected to the time limitation but did not\nspecify what evidence they would have presented if more\ntime had been allotted, nor did they request additional time.\nSee id. (rejecting the plaintiff’s argument after noting similar\ncircumstances). Although the case was factually complex the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by limiting time for\ntrial to three days per side.\n\n  [2] Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\ndecertifying the “damages class.” The court reasoned that\n\f5580                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nRule 23(b)(3) would not offer a superior method for fair and\nefficient adjudication in light of expected difficulties identify-\ning class members and determining appropriate damages. It\nexplained: “Class membership here would be highly fluid and\nindefinite. Issues of damages proof would be highly individu-\nalized and poorly addressed through a sampling. There are too\nmany damages variables.”\n\n   Plaintiffs counter that the district court ignored viable ways\nof assessing the damages for the Pierce class (estimated to be\nsome 180,000 pretrial detainees), and—as a result—harbored\nundue concerns about managing the class. Plaintiffs suggest\nthat damages could be calculated by relying on records main-\ntained by the County. Yet, they concede that such records are\nincomplete, and—in fact—at various points in the trial, they\nobjected to reliance on the County’s records on the ground\nthat they were inconsistent or unreliable. Plaintiffs propose,\nalternatively, that statistical sampling could have been used to\nascertain the aggregate amount of damages suffered by the\nclass. The district court acknowledged that statistical sam-\npling may be an appropriate tool for computing damages in\nsome cases, but rejected that approach here. We conclude that\nthe district court’s decision was not an abuse of discretion\ngiven the facts of this case—in particular, the size of the class\nand the array of variables related to causation and damages.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D).8\n\nB.     The district court’s exclusion of plaintiffs’ proposed\n       evidence was either not an abuse of discretion, or it\n       did not prejudice plaintiffs.\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that three of the court’s evidentiary rul-\n  8\n    Plaintiffs’ briefs suggest that they seek only nominal damages on\nbehalf of the class and therefore do not present issues of individual dam-\nages. The remainder of plaintiffs’ argument belies this assertion, however,\nas the “aggregated damages” they describe are compensatory—not nomi-\nnal.\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                 5581\nings are erroneous. First, plaintiffs challenge the district\ncourt’s decision to bar admission of the survey conducted by\nplaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Pourat. Second, plaintiffs charge that\nthe district court abused its discretion in ruling that plaintiffs\ncould not submit deposition testimony of class members who\nwere in prisons more than 100 miles from the courthouse.\nThird, plaintiffs contend that the district court committed\nreversible error when it allowed the County to introduce state-\nments by absent class members.\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s construction or inter-\npretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence, including whether\nparticular evidence falls within the scope of a given rule.\nUnited States v. Durham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795871\"><a href=\"/opinion/795871/united-states-v-jessica-durham/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 981 (9th Cir. 2006).\nThe district court’s ultimate evidentiary ruling to admit or\nexclude the evidence is, however, reviewed for abuse of dis-\ncretion. See id.; City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687691\"><a href=\"/opinion/687691/1995-1-trade-cases-p-70875-41-fed-r-evid-serv-587-the-city-of-long/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 936 (9th Cir. 1995).

Plain-\ntiffs’ experts were permitted to rely upon the Pourat Survey\nin formulating their opinions, and to share the data upon\nwhich they relied. McManimon described how the survey was\nconducted and noted its results—for example, that 35% of the\ndetainees surveyed reported that they were given less than fif-\nteen minutes per meal on at least one occasion, and that 67%\nof that group (in other words, approximately 23% of the sur-\nveyed population) reported that this occurred on at least a\nweekly basis.\n\n  2.   Deposition testimony of class members.\n\n   [4] Relying on Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(5) regard-\ning the unavailability of witnesses, plaintiffs assert that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it ruled that they\ncould not submit deposition testimony of class members who\nwere incarcerated in prisons more than one hundred miles\nfrom the courthouse. “Unavailability” may be found when the\ndeclarant “is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a\nstatement has been unable to procure the declarant’s atten-\ndance . . . by process or other reasonable means.” Fed.

The district court judge refused to admit the\nproposed testimony under Rule 804 because he concluded that\nthe plaintiffs had not made an adequate attempt to procure the\nwitnesses’ attendance. He noted that the parties had been\nwarned about the “necessary administrative steps” to sub-\npoena the prisoners, and found that plaintiffs had waited too\nlong to seek the subpoenas. On appeal, plaintiffs do not con-\ntest this factual finding, and we therefore conclude that the\ndistrict court judge’s determination was not an abuse of dis-\ncretion.\n\n  3.   Statements of absent class members as “admissions of\n       a party-opponent.”\n\n   Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by admitting\nthe statements of absent—also referred to as unnamed or\nnonnamed—class members as “admissions of a party-\nopponent” under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A). Fol-\nlowing the court’s ruling, the County introduced statements\nby twenty-four absent members of the class of pretrial detain-\nees. Plaintiffs were then allowed to counter-designate testi-\nmony by those detainees under Federal Rule of Evidence 106,\nthe general rule of completeness.\n\n   For an absent member of a Rule 23(b)(2) class to be treated\nas a party—and, hence, as a party representative of the class\nas a whole—for Rule 801 purposes there must be some mech-\nanism to ensure that he or she will represent the interests of\nthe class.

At least eighteen of the twenty-four state-\nments that the County sought to introduce under Rule\n801(d)(2) were taken from detainees on that list. We are satis-\nfied that, on the facts of this case, reliance on statements by\ndetainees who had been disclosed by plaintiffs’ counsel as\npotential witnesses adequately protected the class from the\nrisk of having the class’s interests undermined by unrepresen-\ntative class members. The district court did not abuse its dis-\ncretion by admitting those statements.9\n\n   The remaining statements admitted by the court, and now\nchallenged by the plaintiffs, were not disclosed to plaintiffs.\nWe need not decide whether the statements of these detainees\nshould have been excluded under Rule 801, as we conclude,\nupon review of the record as a whole (and in particular the\nother eighteen admitted statements), that the admission of\nthose five statements was not prejudicial.

The\nPLRA both limits the prospective relief a court may order in\nsuch suits, and authorizes the termination of relief that does\nnot fall within those limits. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)-(b). Section\n3626(b)(1)(A) of Title 18 provides:\n\n     In any civil action with respect to prison conditions\n     in which prospective relief is ordered, such relief\n     shall be terminable upon the motion of any party or\n     intervener . . .

In March 2004, approximately eight months\nbefore trial, the district court consolidated Stewart and Pierce,\nciting the fact that questions of the continuing legitimacy of\nthe injunctive orders in Stewart had been raised in various\nmotions in Pierce. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 42 (giving the district\ncourt authority to consolidate matters involving common\nquestions of law or fact).11 The court provided the parties with\nnotice that it would review the status of the existing Stewart\norders and ordered related briefing. The plaintiffs did not\nobject, and filed a brief addressing the legal bases for all of\nthe Stewart orders.\n\n   Prior to the district court’s decision to vacate the Stewart\norders, the County made two written requests for termination\nor modification—first, in its pre-trial brief, and then in its\nclosing brief after trial. While only the latter was styled a\nmotion, the former formally requested that “the Stewart\norders either be vacated or modified.”\n  10\n    As discussed further infra, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3) states:\n     [p]rospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written\n     findings based on the record that prospective relief remains nec-\n     essary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal\n     right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of\n     the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly\n     drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\n  11\n     Plaintiffs acknowledged at a March 5, 2004 status conference that the\nCounty had raised questions about the enforceability of the orders in Stew-\nart.\n\f                      PIERCE v.

Nor do the\nplaintiffs suggest any way in which, if accorded earlier notice,\nthey would have handled matters differently. Plaintiffs were\nprovided with adequate notice, and so we hold that the district\ncourt had authority to review and, if otherwise appropriate\nunder § 3626, to modify or to terminate the Stewart orders.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b); Miller, 530 U.S. at 353 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting) (observing that the district court may modify or\nterminate relief).12\n\n                          V.

First, we consider order by order whether\ntermination of the prospective relief ordered in Stewart was\nproper. Second, we consider the Pierce plaintiffs appeal of the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the mealtimes; holding cell\nconditions; and access to religious services, the day room, and\nexercise provided by the County did not violate plaintiffs’\nrights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.13 Third, we address plaintiffs’\n  12\n      In its final disposition the district court, in some instances, referred to\nhaving “vacate[d]” the Stewart orders.

We read the district\ncourt’s Stewart Final Order as merely terminating prospective relief, not\nvacating the Stewart judgment in its entirety. See Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail v.

The district court repeatedly acknowledged its authority under\n§ 3626 to modify (and thereby expand or diminish) the existing Stewart\ninjunction as it pertained to the same topics—mealtimes; holding cell con-\nditions; and access to religious services, the day room, and exercise—as\nrequired by the evidence presented. In light of this, we agree that the\ncourt’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ additional and separate request for injunc-\ntive relief in the same Orange County jails with regard to the same condi-\ntions was not in error.\n\f5588                  PIERCE v.

Standards for termination of prospective relief under\n       the PLRA.\n\n   [7] Under the PLRA, the Stewart injunctive orders should\nnot have been terminated if, on the record presented, they sat-\nisfied the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3). The Act\nprovides that relief shall not terminate if it “remains necessary\nto correct a current and ongoing violation of [a] Federal right,\nextends no further than necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right, and . . . is narrowly drawn and the least\nintrusive means to correct the violation.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3).14 Review of an injunction pursuant to the\nPLRA’s standards is thus sometimes referred to as a “need-\nnarrowness-intrusiveness” inquiry. Handberry v. Thompson,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n   [8] This standard requires an assessment of the\ncircumstances—both legal and factual—at the time termina-\ntion is sought. See Gilmore, 220 F.3d at 1010 (citing Benja-\nmin v. Jacobsen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762752\"><a href=\"/opinion/762752/james-benjamin-v-michael-jacobson-commissioner-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166 (2d Cir. 1999)).

Under the Due Process Clause,\ndetainees have a right against jail conditions or restrictions\n  14\n     The district court’s final order in Stewart suggests that the fact that a\nparticular right has been well-established may militate against a finding\nthat prospective relief remains necessary and appropriate. This view is\nunsupported by § 3626(b)(3). The question, in such a case, is simply\nwhether there is a current and ongoing violation of the right, and whether\nthe relief is properly tailored to correct the violation as required by the\nstatute.\n\f                 PIERCE v.

Because our\nreview of these two orders overlaps considerably with our\nreview of the claims brought by the plaintiffs in Pierce under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and California state law, we address plain-\ntiffs’ claims as part of our review of the termination of the\norders themselves.\n  16\n   We note that there may be some tension in our case law in this area.\nCompare Mayweathers v.

COUNTY OF ORANGE\n  1.    Termination of Stewart Orders related to reading\n        materials, mattresses and beds, law books, population\n        caps, sleep, blankets, telephone access, and\n        communication with jailhouse lawyers.\n\n   [9] The district court found that the Stewart order regarding\nthe availability of reading materials by mail, as well as the\norder regarding the availability of mattresses and beds, prop-\nerly sought to enforce detainees’ federal rights. The district\ncourt also acknowledged that the Stewart order regarding law-\nbook access merely required that the County’s policy be\napplied to each of its jail facilities. The district court went on\nto conclude, however, that these orders were not needed to\ncorrect current and ongoing violations. We agree. The County\npresented evidence tending to show its compliance with these\nStewart orders,17 and the plaintiffs did not present any con-\ntrary evidence related to these orders to contest the County’s\nshowing.\n\n   The district court also acknowledged that population caps\nmay be an appropriate remedy when overcrowding rises to the\nlevel of constitutional violation, but found no ongoing viola-\ntion here. On the record presented we agree.\n\n   Finally, the district court terminated the Stewart orders per-\ntaining to sleeptimes, blanket use, telephone access, commu-\nnications with “jailhouse lawyers,” and visitation for inmates\nin administrative segregation. In light of the County’s presen-\ntation of evidence and the plaintiffs’ failure to contest the\nCounty’s showing, we affirm the district court on the ground\n  17\n     Testimony and documentary evidence showed that deputies and other\nofficials or employees of the Sheriff’s department received substantial\ntraining regarding the Stewart orders, and that department policies had\nbeen modified to reflect the requirements set out in Stewart. In addition,\nlaminated reference cards were distributed to jail employees, to be carried\nin their uniforms, as reminders of the Stewart orders. Sheriff’s department\nemployees testified, with specificity, to their roles in ensuring compliance\nwith the Stewart orders.\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE              5593\nthat these orders are not necessary to correct current and\nongoing violations. We therefore do not reach the question of\nwhether these orders extend no further than necessary and are\nnarrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the\nviolation. See § 3626(b)(3).\n\n  2.        Termination of Stewart Orders related to seating and\n            meal times.\n\n       a.     Seating/holding cells.\n\n  [10] The Stewart order requires that inmates be provided\nwith seating while detained in holding cells, or elsewhere,\nawaiting transport to or from court. We affirm the district\ncourt’s termination of the order, as we conclude that the evi-\ndence presented does not suggest that the continuation of pro-\nspective relief was necessary to correct a current and ongoing\nconstitutional violation.\n\n   The record shows that the County actively seeks to avoid\novercrowding of holding cells; maximum capacities are\nposted in the cells, and deputies monitor the cells to ensure\ncompliance. Deputies testified that, on occasion, overcrowd-\ning of a particular holding cell may be necessary for logistical\nand security reasons, but—as the district court found—these\ninstances occur infrequently. Moreover, the record here shows\nthat the hardship associated with the County’s occasional\novercrowding of the holding cells does not rise to the level of\nconstitutional violation, given the relatively short periods (i.e.,\nmatters of hours) detainees spend in the holding cells. There\nis no evidence of unsanitary conditions or other concerns that\nwould elevate such overcrowding to a constitutional violation.\nSee, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 542; Lareau v. Manson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391181\"><a href=\"/opinion/391181/donald-j-lareau-v-john-r-manson-commissioner-of-correction-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (2d Cir. 1981). For these reasons, we also affirm the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that plaintiffs failed to establish\nthat the treatment of detainees in the County’s holding cells\nconstituted a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\f5594                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n       b.   Time for meals.\n\n   The Stewart order requires that inmates be given “not less\nthan fifteen minutes within which to complete each meal.”\nThe district court terminated this Stewart order and rejected\nplaintiffs’ § 1983 claim that they had been denied adequate\nmeal times in violation of a federally protected right.\n\n   [11] Turning to plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim, we conclude that\nthey have not established that the mealtimes allowed by the\nCounty amounted to punishment in the constitutional sense\nand thus a deprivation of substantive due process. The only\npotential ground for constitutional relief suggested by the\nrecord would be a liberty interest created by a state regulation,\nin this case Cal. Code. Regs. Tit. 15, § 1240.

How-\never, the plaintiffs have not appealed the district court’s pre-\ntrial ruling that this was not adequately pled as a basis for\n§ 1983 relief.\n\n   Finally, plaintiffs brought a state law claim for relief based\non California Code of Regulations § 1240. Even assuming,\nwithout deciding, that § 1240 is sufficient to create an action-\nable duty under California law, see Cal. Govt. Code § 815.6;\nHaggis v.

COUNTY OF ORANGE               5595\nC.     The district court erred by terminating two Stewart\n       orders mandating minimal access to religious services\n       and exercise for inmates housed in administrative\n       segregation.\n\n   Three of the remaining fourteen Stewart orders under\nreview concern conditions for inmates in administrative seg-\nregation. As mentioned above, see n.3, supra, administrative\nsegregation is a classification for inmates with violent tenden-\ncies that have been deemed a threat to the jail’s staff or to\nother inmates. The Stewart orders provide that inmates classi-\nfied as administrative segregation must nonetheless be pro-\nvided with limited access to religious services, limited access\nto exercise, and limited access to use of a day room. The dis-\ntrict court terminated all three Stewart orders ensuring such\naccess, and likewise found that plaintiffs had not proved any\nactionable § 1983 claim based on a deprivation of those\nrights. As explained below, we conclude that the district\ncourt’s finding that inmates in administrative segregation\nwere only “sporadically” denied access to religious services\nis clearly erroneous. The denials were systematic, and suffi-\nciently so to constitute a violation of § 1983. Likewise, the\nrecord also demonstrates that detainees in administrative seg-\nregation were not provided with even the two hours per week\nof exercise required under the Stewart order. We are satisfied\nthat providing inmates only ninety minutes of exercise per\nweek—less than thirteen minutes per day—does not comport\nwith constitutional standards, and that such a severe curtail-\nment of the detainees’ ability to exercise evidences its puni-\ntive intent and necessitates reinstatement of the Stewart order.\n\n  1.    Termination of Stewart order related to religious\n        worship.\n\n   The Stewart order requires that inmates in administrative\nsegregation be allowed one of the following opportunities for\nreligious worship: attending regularly scheduled religious ser-\nvices once a week, making short individual visits to the\n\f5596                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nchapel once each week, or meeting with a bona fide religious\nadviser upon request of the inmate or adviser. The order also\nprovides for the curtailment or elimination of the right if, in\nthe course of exercising it, the inmate is disruptive or violent.\n\n   [12] Under the Constitution, “reasonable opportunities\nmust be afforded to all prisoners to exercise the religious free-\ndom guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”\nCruz v.

However, as with other First\nAmendment rights in the inmate context, detainees’ rights\nmay be limited or retracted if required to “maintain[ ] institu-\ntional security and preserv[e] internal order and discipline.”\nBell, 441 U.S. at 549; see, e.g., Freeman v.

Restrictions on access to “religious\nopportunities”—whether group services, chapel visits, or\nmeetings with religious advisers—must be found reasonable\nin light of four factors: (1) whether there is a “valid, rational\nconnection” between the regulation and a legitimate govern-\nment interest put forward to justify it; (2) “whether there are\nalternative means of exercising the right that remain open to\nprison inmates”; (3) whether accommodation of the asserted\nconstitutional right would have a significant impact on guards\nand other inmates; and (4) whether ready alternatives are\nabsent (bearing on the reasonableness of the regulation).

Although the court’s final order in Pierce acknowl-\nedges evidence of at least “[o]ccasional instances of\nimpediments to participation,” the court characterized these\ndenials as merely “sporadic.” But the record evidences consis-\ntent denial of access to the chapel (whether for group services\nor individual visits) and to religious advisers to those in\nadministrative segregation.\n\f5598                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n   Both of the plaintiffs’ witnesses that were housed in admin-\nistrative segregation, Fermin Valenzuela and Keith Hawkins,\ntestified that they were routinely denied access to any kind of\nreligious worship. Valenzuela testified that none of his\nrequests to meet with his chaplain were granted, and testified\nthat the verbal explanation he received for the denial was that\ninmates “in administrative segregation . . . don’t have it com-\ning.” Likewise, Hawkins testified that when he was classified\nin administrative segregation between March 2003 and June\n2003, he was “never” allowed to attend chapel. Even the\nCounty’s own witness, Deputy Brian Nissen, testified that he\nhad “never seen one of our Ad Seg inmates” in chapel.\n\n   The County’s evidence was not to the contrary. Although\nthe County argues on appeal that testimony from three\ndetainee plaintiffs (detainees Conn, Palmitessa and Robledo)\nsupported its contention that it provided “regular access to\nreligious services and clergy at every opportunity,” the record\ndoes not bear out the County’s characterization. Conn—who\nwas not an administrative segregation inmate—merely testi-\nfied that he was permitted to attend chapel and that no Deputy\never told him that administrative segregation inmates had lim-\nited access to religious services. We are not persuaded that an\ninmate’s failure to obtain a voluntary admission of non-\ncompliance from his jailer somehow constitutes proof of com-\npliance. Similarly, Palmitessa—also not an administrative\nsegregation detainee—testified that he went to chapel when-\never it was offered, but that it had not, in fact, been offered\nto him for several weeks. Finally, Robledo—another non-\nadministrative segregation witness—testified on cross-\nexamination that she was allowed access to religious services,\nbut as she made clear on re-direct, she had “difficulties” get-\nting access to chapel.20\n  20\n    Although the County offers the testimony of these three non-\nadministrative segregation detainees to support affirmance, it simulta-\nneously chastises the plaintiffs for referring to the testimony of several\nother non-administrative segregation detainees who testified that they had\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5599\n   Nor did the County’s affirmative evidence support the dis-\ntrict court’s factual finding that the County provides “opportu-\nnities for inmates to participate in religious services and\ncounseling,” at least not as to administrative segregation\ndetainees. The County relied primarily on the testimony of\ntwo jail personnel—Sergeant Dubsky and Deputy McCulloch\n—to support its contention that inmates were provided “regu-\nlar access to religious services and clergy at every opportuni-\nty.” Sergeant Dubsky testified that administrative segregation\ndetainees must fill out a message slip to obtain access to a\nchaplain, and that there is no limitation on the number of vis-\nits available. But Sergeant Dubsky did not testify that admin-\nistrative segregation detainees were actually given such\naccess. Likewise, Deputy McCulloch merely testified as to the\nmanner in which chapel is called for non-administrative seg-\nregation detainees. He did not establish that chapel was called\nweekly, bi-weekly or with any other pattern of regularity.\n\n   A custom can be shown or a policy can be inferred from\nwidespread practices or “evidence of repeated constitutional\nviolations for which the errant municipal officers were not\ndischarged or reprimanded.” Gillette v.

Plain-\ntiffs’ counsel asked the Sheriffs’ department officials who tes-\ntified whether deputies were ever disciplined or reprimanded\nfor Stewart violations. No witness was able to identify any\n\ngreat difficulty in gaining any access to religious services. For example,\nDetainee Ronald Rogers testified that he had “never in over two-and-a-\nhalf years been offered religious services.” Detainee James Sukanich testi-\nfied that when housed in the main jail he had not been given access to any\nreligious services for seven months. Detainee Edward Swanstrom testified\nthat he received “no response” to his multiple requests for access to reli-\ngious services. Although the district court’s finding of “sporadic” denials\nis erroneous without consideration of this additional testimony, it nonethe-\nless undermines the County’s claim that inmates, in any population,\nreceived regular access to religious services.\n\f5600              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\ninstance in which disciplinary steps were taken or a reprimand\nwas issued.\n\n   [15] Moreover, the County’s witnesses did not contend, and\nits brief on appeal does not suggest, that detainees in adminis-\ntrative segregation are denied worship opportunities because\nof security concerns, or for other legitimate non-punitive rea-\nsons. The district court should not have blindly deferred to the\nCounty’s bare invocation of security concerns, when the\nCounty has failed to even establish that there is regular access\nto religious services for administrative segregation detainees,\nmuch less that interruptions in such access are on account of\nsecurity.

In sum, the district court erred in denying\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief under § 1983.\n\n   [16] Similarly, the Stewart order remains necessary to\nensure that detainees in administrative segregation are not\ndenied access based on their classification alone. We there-\nfore reverse the judgment of the district court with regard to\nthis component of the Stewart injunction, as the record dem-\nonstrates that its enforcement “remains necessary to correct a\ncurrent and ongoing violation of [a] Federal right.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3). We also conclude that the Stewart order, as\npresently constituted, extends no further than is necessary and\nis the least intrusive means to correct the violation. Id. The\nterms of the Stewart injunction require that detainees in\nadministrative segregation be afforded opportunities for wor-\nship, provided the detainees have not become disruptive or\nviolent, implicating legitimate security concerns, even though\nthe injunction does not require that detainees be afforded\naccess to group religious services. The jail may instead satisfy\nthe order by allowing individual chapel visits or meetings\nwith religious advisers. In sum, the order—with its provision\nfor the curtailment or elimination of detainees’ rights based\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE            5601\non security concerns—provides for no more than a minimum\nlevel of ongoing participation in religious activities. Accord-\ningly, we conclude that the injunction is narrowly drawn and\nextends no further than necessary to correct the violation of\na Federal right. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).\n\n  2.

Neb. 1980).\n\n   [18] The record shows that pretrial detainees in administra-\ntive segregation and other restrictive classifications, such as\nprotective custody, are typically afforded, at best, only ninety\nminutes weekly in a space equipped for exercise.22 Although\nwe need not hold that there is a specific minimum amount of\nweekly exercise that must be afforded to detainees who spend\nthe bulk of their time inside their cells, we hold that providing\nthe equivalent of slightly less than thirteen minutes of exer-\ncise a day does not give meaningful protection to this basic\nhuman necessity. See Lemaire, 12 F.3d at 1457; Housely, 41\nF.3d at 599. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs have estab-\nlished a violation of § 1983.\n\n   [19] In finding no punitive intent, the district court relied\nexclusively on the fact that “a group of detainees congregat-\ning in an open area containing weights and other equipment\nraises security concerns.” We agree that the County has con-\nsiderable discretion to curtail access to exercise based on\nsecurity concerns.

Here, however,\nthe curtailment to ninety minutes weekly for inmates who oth-\n  22\n     The County contends that, contrary to the testimony of several\ninmates, detainees may also exercise in the day rooms. The County con-\ncedes, however, that day rooms are not designed for exercise and that\ndetainees may not use any of the room’s fixtures (such as bars, chairs,\ntables, or wall hooks) for exercise purposes. While inmates’ access to day\nrooms, discussed further infra, is a factor affecting our determination of\nwhat constitutes adequate exercise, it does not—given the space con-\nstraints and absence of any appropriate equipment—constitute an exercise\nopportunity.\n\f                  PIERCE v.

The County has provided\nnothing more to justify this almost complete denial of exer-\ncise than a generalized reference to institutional security con-\ncerns. It has made no showing that such a severe restriction\nis reasonably related to satisfying those concerns. Compare\nSpain v. Procunier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367000\"><a href=\"/opinion/367000/johnny-l-spain-v-raymond-k-procunier/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192, 199-200 (9th Cir.\n1979) (impermissible to completely deny access to outdoor\nexercise for a particular category of inmates, even when\ninmates within that category were being disciplined for com-\nmitting violent acts while in prison) with LeMaire, 12 F.3d at\n1458 (upholding denial of exercise privileges for a particular\ninmate deemed a “grave security risk” who had previously\nattacked corrections officers). Given the severity of the cur-\nrent restrictions and their application across an entire category\nof detainees, we conclude that ninety minutes of exercise per\nweek constitutes punishment for purposes of § 1983.\n\n   [20] Accordingly, we also determine that the Stewart order,\nwhich requires that inmates in administrative segregation be\npermitted exercise at least twice each week for a total of not\nless than 2 hours per week, is “necessary to correct a current\nand ongoing violation of [a] Federal right.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3626(b)(3). We likewise conclude that the Stewart order, as\nit is currently constituted, is “narrowly drawn and is the least\nintrusive means to correct the violation.” Id. The Stewart\norder requires considerably less exercise—just two hours a\nweek—than the one hour a day recognized elsewhere as a\nconstitutional floor. More importantly, the Stewart order con-\ntains a safety-valve that permits the County, in its discretion,\nto “curtail or eliminate” exercise rights “in the event such\ninmate becomes violent or disruptive in the course of exercis-\ning such rights.” Thus, the existing Stewart order accords the\nCounty sufficient deference in determining whether a particu-\nlar inmate poses a risk to security requiring limitations on or\n\f5604              PIERCE v.

Termination of Stewart order related to access to day\n       room.\n\n   The Stewart order requires that inmates be given access to\nthe day room for two hours daily, but provides for curtailment\nor elimination of the right to day room access for security or\ndisciplinary reasons. Confinement necessarily imposes\nrestraints on detainees’ freedom of movement and access to\nrecreation. Nonetheless, such restrictions may “constitute\npunishment in the constitutional sense,” and thus violate the\nFourteenth Amendment, if they are not “rationally related to\na legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose and . . . appear\nexcessive in relation to that purpose.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 561.\nGiven the conditions and average duration of confinement in\nadministrative segregation and similarly restrictive classifica-\ntions, failure to provide detainees with the opportunity for\nsome daily out-of-cell movement raises serious constitutional\nquestions. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 (considering day room\naccess as a factor that mitigates overcrowding); Lock v. Jen-\nkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387260\"><a href=\"/opinion/387260/donald-a-lock-v-leo-d-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493-94 (7th Cir. 1981) (finding that the\nimportance of day room access increases as the length of time\nthe detainee spends in the cell increases and the size of the\ncell decreases).\n\n   [21] The record evidence demonstrated that administrative\nsegregation detainees, were, in fact, given access to the day\nroom. The restrictions placed on use of the day room—\nlimiting administrative segregation detainees’ use of the room\nto one or two inmates at a time—are reasonably related to\ninstitutional security concerns. For these reasons, we affirm\nthe district court’s denial of plaintiffs’ claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, because in this instance the County’s restrictions still\npermit access to the day rooms and do not evince any punitive\nintent. Accordingly, there is no evidence of a “current and\nongoing violation of a Federal right,” and we therefore also\n\f                      PIERCE v.

The district court erred by finding that the County\n       was not in violation of the ADA.\n\n   Having addressed the portions of this appeal relating to the\nStewart injunction and the claims of the overall Pierce class,\nwe turn our attention to the rights of the Pierce sub-class of\nmobility- and dexterity-impaired pretrial detainees.\n\n   Plaintiffs argued at trial that the County was not in compli-\nance with the ADA or California’s co-extensive access\nrequirements at § 54.1 of the California Civil Code. Plaintiffs\nmaintained that the County failed to address numerous struc-\ntural barriers and, as a result, denied mobility- and dexterity-\nimpaired detainees access to various features and elements of\ntheir cells and common spaces. They also argued that,\nbecause of their disabilities, they were segregated and denied\naccess to a variety of the County’s educational, rehabilitative,\nand recreation programs, services, and activities for pretrial\ndetainees. Despite finding that the County was not “in full\nADA compliance,” the district court “decline[d] to declare an\nADA or California Civil Code violation, or order injunctive\nrelief.” This decision cannot stand. As we explain below, we\n  23\n     Plaintiffs advance two related claims based on state law. First, plain-\ntiffs argue that § 1053 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulation\ncreates a general mandatory duty actionable under § 815.6 of the Califor-\nnia Government Code. We disagree. Because of the high degree of discre-\ntion left to officials under § 1053, we do not agree that § 1053 satisfies the\nstandard articulated in Haggis, 22 Cal. 4th at 498. Second, plaintiffs main-\ntain that § 1065 of Title 15 creates a duty actionable under § 815.6. During\nthe relevant time period, § 1065 instructed the jails’ facility administrators\nto develop written policies and procedures to provide a minimum of three\nhours of exercise or recreation per week. Even assuming § 1065 satisfies\nCalifornia’s three-pronged test, see Haggis, 22 Cal. 4th at 498, the evi-\ndence does not show a lack of reasonable diligence in providing the\ndetainee population three hours of exercise or day room recreation per\nweek. We affirm the district court’s denial of these state law claims.\n\f5606                 PIERCE v.

The\nregulations, however, note in relevant part that: (1) a public\nentity is not necessarily required “to make each of its existing\nfacilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabili-\nties,” id. § 35.150(a)(1); and (2) a public entity is not required\n“to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a\nfundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or\nactivity or in undue financial and administrative burdens,” id.\n§ 35.150(a)(3).26\n  26\n    Section 35.150(a)(3) further explains:\n       In those circumstances where personnel of the public entity\n       believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the\n       service, program, or activity or would result in undue financial\n       and administrative burdens, a public entity has the burden of\n       proving that compliance with § 35.150(a) of this part would\n       result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance\n       would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the\n       head of a public entity or his or her designee after considering all\n       resources available for use in the funding and operation of the\n       service, program, or activity, and must be accompanied by a writ-\n       ten statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.

That plan was directed more toward struc-\ntural modifications of public and visitor areas than toward\ncompliance in inmate areas.” The district court went on to\nstate that “inmate witnesses and plaintiff’s expert, Mr. Robert-\nson, identified various specific architectural barriers and fea-\ntures that are out of compliance with the ADA.”\n\n   These findings are clearly supported by the record. As of\n2004, when the case went to trial, the County housed\nmobility- and dexterity-impaired pretrial detainees in two of\nits five facilities—the Men’s and Women’s Central Jails.\nMale inmates with such disabilities were placed in one of\n\f5612                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nthree parts of Module O in the Men’s Jail: Sheltered Living,\nWard C, or Ward D. Female inmates with such disabilities\nwere housed in either Sheltered Living in Module P of the\nWomen’s Jail or the infirmary. Plaintiffs’ expert witness Peter\nRobertson was permitted to tour these areas, and to take pho-\ntographs and measurements of the structures and fixtures. He\ntestified at length regarding his measurements, observations,\nand conclusions. Robertson maintained that a host of features\nand fixtures—including toilets, sinks, showers, hot water dis-\npensers, telephones, and water fountains—in cells or common\nspaces the County referred to as “accessible” did not comply\nwith federal accessibility standards.30 Since the district court’s\norder fails to specify which “architectural barriers and fea-\ntures [were] out of compliance with the ADA,” we limit our-\nselves to noting—in support of the court’s proper, but vague,\nfinding—that a number of the deficiencies reported by Rob-\nertson were conceded by Ron Bihner, the project manager\ncharged with supervising structural modifications at the\nCounty jails pursuant to the Transition Plan, and many others\nwere not explicitly disputed. Notably, Bihner agreed that the\nshowers in Wards C and D were not accessible to the\nmobility-impaired, conceded that the toilet and sink in the\nwomen’s infirmary day room were inaccessible to individuals\nin wheelchairs, and acknowledged that the rooftop exercise\n  30\n    Our references to “accessibility”—like those made by the district\ncourt and the parties—are to be construed in terms of the impairments of\nthe sub-class of mobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees. Issues of\naccessibility for those with other impairments—such as loss of hearing or\nsight—are not before us.\n   Robertson examined housing cells which the County asserted were\nintended to accommodate individuals with mobility and dexterity disabili-\nties. There was one such cell in Men’s Sheltered Living (an area dedicated\nto housing disabled detainees, which consists of eighteen cells, each hous-\ning two to four inmates), three such cells in Women’s Sheltered Living,\nand one such cell in the Women’s Infirmary. Men’s Wards C and D are\nopen dormitory-style medical wards and do not consist of discrete cells.\nRobertson also examined day rooms and other common spaces intended\nfor use by those with mobility and dexterity impairments.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5613\nand recreation areas afforded to male and female disabled\ndetainees did not offer accessible bathroom facilities.31 The\nCounty presented no evidence to dispute Robertson’s asser-\ntions that rooftop telephones and water fountains were inac-\ncessible to those in wheelchairs and that the sinks and toilets\nserving the Women’s Central Jail classroom were inaccessi-\nble, as well as facilities in other areas.32\n\n   [23] While it is evident that the district court was well-\nsupported by the record when it observed (albeit without\nspecificity) that the “existence of barriers” had been shown,\nthe district court inexplicably made further findings which are\nunsupported by and contrary to the record: The court con-\ncluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief because\nthey had not shown that “effective modifications could be\nmade,” or that “where an architectural shortcoming existed, it\nwas not made accessible by other appropriate action taken by\na jail employee.” The district court asserted broadly that\nwhere structural corrections had not been made, the County\nhad shown that “other effective remedies [were] in use.”\n  31\n      In the men’s rooftop area, for example, the bathroom facilities can\nonly be reached via a narrow doorway and stairs. The County’s Transition\nPlan did not include any plans to modify any elements or features of the\nmen’s or women’s rooftop recreation areas.\n   32\n      As we discuss further infra, the County asserted that it did not house\nmobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees in its other jail facilities—Theo\nLacy, James A. Musick, and the Intake Release Center (“IRC”). The\nCounty acknowledged, however, that disabled detainees are kept in the\nIRC’s holding cells and booking cells. Because the County did not permit\nRobertson to tour those areas, the only related evidence came from the\nstatement of a Sheriff’s Department official, Lieutenant Rick Edgmon.\nEdgmon claimed that two cells in the booking loop (one female and one\nmale) had been partially modified. At that time of this statement in July\n2003, he noted that accessible sinks had not yet been installed. Neither he\nnor other witnesses stated whether, or to what extent, any cells in the “re-\nlease section” of the IRC had been modified, as called for by the Transi-\ntion Plan.\n\f5614             PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n   To begin, we agree that plaintiffs were required to show\n“ ‘the existence of . . . reasonable accommodation[s]’ ” that\nwould enable them to make use of the facilities. Zukle, 166\nF.3d at 1046 (quoting Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758399\"><a href=\"/opinion/758399/robert-barnett-v-us-air-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n749 (9th Cir. 1998)). Any finding that they did not do so is\nlegal error. Robertson’s testimony included site-specific sug-\ngestions of structural, as well as non-structural, accommoda-\ntions. He drew upon the minimum standards set out in the\nUFAS or the ADAAG for proposed structural changes, such\nas the repositioning of a sink or the replacement of controls.\nSee 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1) (requiring that structural modifi-\ncations be made in accord with the guidelines for new con-\nstruction, UFAS or ADAAG). Alternative solutions to remedy\nsome access problems were also offered. For example, Rob-\nertson noted in one instance that an inaccessible water foun-\ntain could be remedied by adding a cup dispenser rather than\nchanging the position of the fountain.\n\n   The district court found further that the County was not\nrequired to remedy structural deficiencies because “other\ncurative methods” provided disabled individuals with the req-\nuisite access. We agree, as a matter of law, that where reason-\nable alternative methods achieve compliance, structural\nchanges to existing facilities need not be made. 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.150(b)(1). However, there is no support for the court’s\nconclusion that such methods were shown to cure the many\nstructural deficiencies in this case.\n\n   The only deficiencies that were shown to be addressed by\nalternate methods were small surface-elevation changes—i.e.,\nridges or curbs—that otherwise posed obstacles to movement\nbetween locations. Robertson observed, for example, that a\nfive-inch curb obstructed access to the women’s rooftop rec-\nreation area. He testified that this could be overcome by hav-\ning a trained deputy guide a wheelchair over the curb. The\nrecord supports the conclusion that deputies, in fact, do this,\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5615\nand plaintiffs are not denied access to the rooftop or other\nlocations because of these surface irregularities.33\n\n   The County did not present evidence, as the district court’s\nbroad finding asserts, that other deficiencies were remedied\nthrough the assistance of deputies or by “other curative meth-\nods.” Plaintiffs, on the other hand, presented evidence to show\nthat deficiencies were not remedied. Robertson testified, for\nexample, that he observed detainees—not deputies—\nstruggling to lift a fellow wheelchair-bound detainee over a\nfoot-high retention wall in one of Ward C’s inaccessible\nshowers. Conn also testified that he was forced to rely on fel-\nlow inmates for assistance when faced with inaccessible bath-\nroom facilities.34\n\n   The impediment posed by such a barrier highlights the\ninadequacy of deputy or other inmate assistance. The County\nmaintained throughout the trial that the deputies have their\nhands full given the ratio of deputies to inmates and the vari-\nous duties incumbent upon the former. Staffing limits make\nit unreasonable to expect to address all structural deficiencies\nthrough deputy assistance.\n\n   The County argues that the district court’s holding should,\nin any event, be affirmed because plaintiffs failed to satisfy\ntheir burden under Turner. We disagree. Even under Turner,\nthe County was required to proffer some reason for its policy\n  33\n      County policies require deputies to transport wheelchair-bound detain-\nees between locations—that is, between their cells and other areas, such\nas the day room, rooftop, or chapel. (In other words, deputies push the\nwheelchairs, rather than allowing the detainees to propel themselves, as\nthey do once they have arrived at a given location.)\n   34\n      While examining Robertson and Bihner, counsel for the County asked\nwhether, in certain instances, assistance from deputies or other non-\nstructural solutions might adequately accommodate individuals with dis-\nabilities. We pause to note the obvious—that such questions and answers\nmay establish that a reasonable accommodation is possible, but do not\nshow that it is practical or has been implemented.\n\f5616                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nor practice. See Armstrong ‘01, 275 F.3d at 874. The County\ndid not posit any legitimate rationale for maintaining inacces-\nsible bathrooms, sinks, showers, and other fixtures in the\nhousing areas and commons spaces assigned to mobility- and\ndexterity impaired detainees.35 The vague assertion by the\nCounty’s counsel that some accommodations might be costly\ncannot be construed as a legitimate basis for failing to comply\nwith the ADA (whether through structural modifications or\nother reasonable methods). See id.; Walker, 917 F.2d at 386.\n\n   [24] We conclude that the district court erred in denying\nrelief because it based its conclusion on clearly erroneous fac-\ntual findings. Accordingly, we remand for further proceed-\nings.\n\n       b.   Integration and access to programs and services.\n\n   Plaintiffs also argued that, by virtue of being housed exclu-\nsively in the Men’s and Women’s Central Jails, they were\ndenied access to a variety of programs, activities, and services\nfor which they would otherwise be eligible. Plaintiffs essen-\ntially advanced two arguments: First, they challenged the\nCounty’s policy of segregating disabled detainees, rather than\nallowing them to reside, recreate, and consume meals in inte-\ngrated settings. Second, they argued that, regardless of where\nthey are housed, the County had not “operate[d] each service,\nprogram, or activity so that the service, program, or activity,\nwhen viewed in its entirety, [was] readily accessible to and\nusable by individuals with disabilities,” as required by 28\nC.F.R. § 35.150(a).\n\n  The district court rejected plaintiffs’ claims. First, the court\nconcluded that the segregation of disabled detainees was rea-\n  35\n     We note the one exception discussed supra. We agree that the Coun-\nty’s policy with regard to small level changes—eschewing structural mod-\nification in favor of another reasonable method of achieving compliance—\nwas not shown to be unreasonable.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                      5617\nsonably related to legitimate interests, and therefore declined\nto order mainstreaming. Second, the court found that “the evi-\ndence shows that, except for the ‘Best Choice’ Program, the\nvarious inmate programs are also available to disabled\ninmates,” and concluded that this was reasonable. The exclu-\nsion of disabled inmates from the Best Choice Program, a\ndrug rehabilitation program, was deemed reasonable in light\nof security concerns.\n\n   [25] We do not find error in the district court’s ruling\nregarding mainstreaming. Sheriff’s Department officials testi-\nfied at some length regarding the security concerns related to\nhousing mobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees with non-\ndisabled detainees. The district court’s finding that plaintiffs\ndid not refute this evidence is not clearly erroneous.\n\n   [26] The district court’s finding that disabled inmates had\naccess to all programs, save the Best Choice program, cannot,\nhowever, be squared with the record.36 As we mentioned ear-\nlier, as of 2004, disabled detainees with mobility and dexterity\nimpairments were not housed in the County’s James A. Mus-\nick Facility or Theo Lacy Facility.37 The testimony of Sher-\niff’s Department officials revealed that Theo Lacy and\nMusick offered a variety of programs, services, and activities\nwhich were not available to inmates of the Men’s and\n  36\n      The district court’s decision speaks only of “inmate programs” and\nmakes no mention of “services” or “activities” offered by the County jails.\nIt is impossible to say whether the court considered the full breadth of\nplaintiffs’ claims (which included services and activities). We assume, for\npurposes of our review, that the court intended to include, and thereby\nreject, plaintiffs’ claim as it related to services and activities.\n   37\n      According to the County, Musick does not offer accessible in-custody\nfacilities. (The Transition Plan only provided for modifications to Mus-\nick’s public and visitor areas.) Theo Lacy, which houses male detainees,\nwas substantially renovated in the late 1990s. County and Sheriff’s\nDepartment officials asserted at trial that a new Sheltered Living module\nfor men was built, but had not yet been staffed due to budgetary con-\nstraints.\n\f5618              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nWomen’s Central Jails. For example, programs in agriculture,\nwoodworking, and welding were among the vocational oppor-\ntunities available at Musick or Theo Lacy, but not available\nat the Central Jail Complex. In addition, detainees at Musick\nand Theo Lacy were afforded opportunities to participate in\noff-site or community work projects. The recreational oppor-\ntunities available at Musick or Theo Lacy—where inmates\nhad access to a softball field, volleyball courts, pool tables,\nand other indoor and outdoor facilities—also exceeded those\nprovided at the Central Jail Complex.\n\n   The Central Jail Complex houses both disabled and non-\ndisabled detainees. However, non-disabled detainees retain at\nleast the possibility of access to the programs offered at Mus-\nick and Theo Lacy, while disabled detainees—solely by virtue\nof their status as disabled—have no possibility of access to\nthe superior services offered outside of the Central Jail Com-\nplex. The ADA does not require perfect parity among pro-\ngrams offered by various facilities that are operated by the\nsame umbrella institution. But an inmate cannot be categori-\ncally excluded from a beneficial prison program based on his\nor her disability alone. Yeskey, 524 U.S. at 210 (“Modern pris-\nons provide inmates with many recreational ‘activities,’ medi-\ncal ‘services,’ and educational and vocational ‘programs,’ all\nof which at least theoretically ‘benefit’ the prisoners (and any\nof which disabled prisoners could be ‘excluded from partici-\npation in’).”). Moreover, ADA regulations contemplate “reas-\nsignment of services to accessible buildings,” as a permissible\nmeans of accommodation. 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1). The\nCounty would not have to make Musick and Theo Lacy phys-\nically or structurally ADA compliant. It might consider, for\nexample, redistributing some programs available at those two\nfacilities to make them available at the Central Jail so that\nwhen “viewed in [their] entirety” the County’s programs are\n“readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabili-\nties.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a). But the County may not shunt\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5619\nthe disabled into facilities where there is no possibility of\naccess to those programs.38\n\n   While the County need not make all of its existing facilities\naccessible to individuals with or without disabilities, it is\nexpected to provide “program access.” 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App.\nA. Any type of educational, vocational, rehabilitative, or rec-\nreational program, service, or activity offered to nondisabled\ndetainees should, when viewed in its entirety, be similarly\navailable to disabled detainees who, with or without reason-\nable accommodations, meet the essential eligibility require-\nments to participate. Whether this “program access” standard\nmay reasonably be met or whether any restriction on access\nis reasonably related to a legitimate government objective is\nnecessarily fact-specific. We also emphasize that the district\ncourt should look at the offerings as a whole and in their\nentirety and thus the court is not required to ensure that each\nindividual program or service offered at Theo Lacy and Mus-\n   38\n      There is no clear case authority on this precise point—whether the\nADA permits an umbrella organization to exclude the disabled from par-\nticular facilities with superior programs and services, so long as there is\none accessible facility with inferior programs. But at least one district\ncourt has noted, in the context of school programs, that there is a “discrim-\ninatory effect” when disabled students are discouraged from “attempting\nto participate in classes and other programs located in inaccessible facili-\nties.” Putnam v. Oakland Unified School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">973734</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *10,\n15 A.D.D. 1361 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 9, 1995). There are, of course, security\nconcerns in a prison system that are not present in a high school system,\nbut the concerns associated with inequalities between different facilities\ninhere in both scenarios. While a court should be “hesitant to second-\nguess” a “good faith accessibility plan,” here there is no plan to make any\nof the services available at Musick and Theo Lacy accessible to disabled\ninmates housed at Central Jail. Id. Thus, while the County has consider-\nable discretion under the regulations to determine whether and how it can\nextend program accessibility, it cannot simply do nothing. Id. (“For exam-\nple, upon determining that none of its schools was accessible with respect\nto all necessary and unique facilities, the District might have decided to\nmake some of its high school campuses partially accessible, in such a way\nas to make all the Districts’ programs accessible at those campuses.”).\n\f5620                PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nick is offered in complete parity with an offering at the Cen-\ntral Jail.\n\n   [27] The County has offered no explanation or justification,\neither in district court or on appeal, for the significant differ-\nences between the vocational and recreational activities avail-\nable at Theo Lacy and Musick, and those available to either\nable or disabled detainees at the Central Jail. As such, the\nCounty has not raised the defense that a policy of restricting\naccess to these programs, services, or activities is reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate government objective. See Armstrong\n‘01, 275 F.3d at 874. We conclude that the district court erred\nwhen it concluded that disabled inmates had access to “the\nvarious inmate programs,” and we must remand as further\nfact-finding is required to determine what relief is appropriate.39\nIn particular, the district court should examine the feasibility\nof offering similar programs at the Central Jail, and the extent\nto which the programs offered at Theo Lacy or Musick are\ncapable of being offered at the Central Jail without eliminat-\ning those programs at Theo Lacy or Musick. There may be\nother appropriate remedies that provide disabled inmates\naccess to programs and services, and the district court should\nconsider those options as well. Our intention is not to suggest\nor cause the termination or diminution of programs or facili-\nties other than the Central Jail, but to have the district court\nexplore available options on a full evidentiary record.\n\n       c.   The district court’s unsupported assumption that\n            the County would “move toward” full compliance\n            was clearly erroneous.\n\n  The district court determined that the County was not in\ncompliance with the ADA, but took it on faith that the County\n  39\n   We do not disturb the district court’s ruling with regard to the Best\nChoice Program but do require the district court to determine whether and\nhow security is a problem and to determine whether other programs at the\nCentral Jail offer similar or essentially equivalent programs.\n\f                     PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                       5621\nwould “move toward full compliance.” This conclusion is\nunwarranted given the County’s track record. The County\nadopted its Transition Plan for structural changes in August\n2000—eight years after the deadline set by the regulations for\nsuch plans, and five and a half years after the regulations’\ndeadline for the completion of structural modifications.40 Fur-\nthermore, when ultimately adopted, the Plan failed to address\nmany architectural barriers in common spaces used by dis-\nabled detainees (for example, those on the rooftop of the\nMen’s and Women’s Jails). Diane DeHaas, the Orange\nCounty ADA Title II Coordinator, testified that the work\nunder the Transition Plan had been completed, and spoke of\nno particular plans to remedy any of the glaring deficiencies.\n\n   The County has done even less to ensure that disabled\ndetainees are given opportunities to benefit from the various\nprograms, activities, and services offered by the jails. While\nTitle II regulations require that the County complete a self-\nevaluation regarding the availability of programs, activities,\nand services, see 28 C.F.R § 35.105(a), DeHaas conceded that\nshe did not know whether it had been done for the County\njails. Moreover, she admitted that she had no information\nabout whether disabled detainees could have access to educa-\ntional programs or a variety of other services.\n\n   In any event, neither the fact that Orange County might\nmove toward compliance nor the district court’s belief that it\nwould do so eventually constituted a proper basis for denying\nplaintiffs relief. We must remand so that the district court can\nengage in further fact-finding, consistent with our opinion, to\ndetermine what relief should be granted. We note that several\nyears have passed since the trial was held, and, as a result,\n  40\n    Further, Ron Bihner testified that the adoption of the Plan was not on\nthe County’s initiative but rather was prompted by a declaratory relief case\nbrought in Orange County Superior Court, Blaser v. Orange County, No.\n78892.\n\f5622               PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\ndetermining what prospective relief is warranted may require\nconsideration of any significantly changed facts.41\n\n  Finally, the district court’s Final Pierce Order did not\naddress plaintiffs’ claims that they were denied adequate\nnotice of their rights under the ADA and an appropriate griev-\nance procedure, as required by the regulations. See 28 C.F.R.\n§§ 35.106, 35.107. On remand, the district court also should\nmake findings on these issues.\n\n       d.   Claims for mental and emotional harms.\n\n   Prior to trial the district court granted summary judgment\nto Orange County on plaintiffs’ claims for mental and emo-\ntional harms. We conclude that decision was in error as it\nrelated to two specific allegations advanced by plaintiff Timo-\nthy Conn.\n\n   [28] According to plaintiffs’ complaint, Conn alleged that\nthe County failed to adequately accommodate his disability in\nviolation of the ADA, and that he suffered physical injuries,\nas well as mental and emotional distress, as a result. The dis-\ntrict court’s March 1, 2004 order held that these alleged inju-\nries were merely de minimis, and therefore precluded by the\nPLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), from giving rise to any cogniza-\nble claim under the ADA for compensatory damages. The\nPLRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), states, “No Federal civil action\nmay be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suf-\nfered while in custody without a prior showing of physical\ninjury.” See Oliver, 289 F.3d at 626-27 (concluding that\n§ 1997e(e) requires a “showing of physical injury that need\nnot be significant but must be more than de minimis.”).\n  41\n    Whether or not disabled detainees are now housed in Theo Lacy will\nobviously be pertinent to the district court’s inquiry.\n\f                      PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                        5623\n   Conn challenges the district court’s determination, arguing\nthat § 1997e(e) does not apply to claims under the ADA and\nthat his injuries were in any case more than de minimis. While\nthe former argument is unpersuasive in light of the plain lan-\nguage of § 1997e(e),42 the latter argument compels our rever-\nsal of the district court’s decision with regard to two of\nConn’s allegations.\n\n   [29] Conn alleged that during his detention in 2000-2001\nhe was denied an adequate supply of catheters, and as a result\nsuffered recurrent bladder infections. He also alleged that he\nwas not provided a proper mattress given his disability, and\nas a result developed bed sores. Neither of these injuries is de\nminimis. Both bladder infections and bed sores pose signifi-\ncant pain and health risks to paraplegics like Conn.43 Our\ncourt has rejected as overly restrictive the standard for de\nminimis injuries espoused by the Northern District of Texas\nin Luong v. Hatt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1447131\"><a href=\"/opinion/1447131/luong-v-hatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We have maintained that if allowing\nclaims for de minimis injuries requires too little of plaintiffs,\n  42\n      Plaintiffs have offered no reasoned basis for carving out an exception\nfor ADA claims.

Section\n1997e(e), however, does not include language similar to that which is\nfound in subsection (d)(3) constraining its application. Moreover, in Arm-\nstrong we explicitly declined to look to other provisions of the PLRA in\ninterpreting § 1997e(d)(3). Id. at 974 n.9; see also Cassidy v.

See Oliver, 289 F.3d at 628. Where, as here, the com-\nplainant is a paraplegic, particular injuries pose different, and possibly\nmore substantial, risks than they might to an average prisoner.\n\f5624                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nthis standard requires too much. Id. Yet notably, Conn’s\nalleged bed sores and bladder infections clear even that strin-\ngent standard.

The district court did not err in rejecting plaintiffs’\n       equal protection claims.\n\n   Finally, the disabled plaintiffs argue that the district court\nimproperly rejected the equal protection claim brought by the\nsub-class of mobility- and dexterity-impaired detainees. After\nreviewing the district court’s November 2004 ruling de novo,\nsee Buono v.

The County argues that, even if Conn’s alleged injuries were not\nde minimis, his claims would not have been actionable under the ADA.\nWe disagree. Providing inmates with appropriate and adequate bedding\nand bathroom facilities are “services” of the jail. The fact that Conn’s\nrequired “bathroom facilities” included catheters does not change the anal-\nysis. The jail was required to provide him with an adequate and appropri-\nate means of relieving himself.

However,\nthe court’s assertion that “disabled and nondisabled detainees\nare not similarly situated for equal-protection purposes” is an\noverstatement.

For example, although plaintiffs\nalleged that paraplegic and quadriplegic detainees were kept\nin holding cells without accessible toilets and sinks, they did\nnot allege that the County accommodated the special needs of\nany other group with regard to toilet or sink access. While\nthese allegations implicate the County’s ADA obligations,\nthey do not, without more, implicate equal protection con-\ncerns.\n\n                       VI.    CONCLUSION\n\n   We affirm all of the district court’s pre-trial management\nand evidentiary rulings challenged on appeal. We conclude\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in consolidat-\ning the Pierce action with the Stewart decree proceeding. We\nfurther hold in respect to the trial that the district court did not\nviolate the Pierce plaintiffs’ due process rights by limiting the\n\f5626              PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\nlength of the trial, nor do we find reversible error in its evi-\ndentiary rulings.\n\n   As to the claim that the district court lacked authority on its\nown to terminate the orders in the Stewart decree, we con-\nclude that the County, in effect, moved for the termination.\nThe parties consented to the consolidation and briefed the\nissues relating to the continuing viability of orders in the\nStewart decree. Accordingly, we hold that the district court\nhad the requisite authority.\n\n   On the merits, of the fourteen Stewart orders under review,\nwe concur in the termination of all but two of those orders,\nand grant plaintiffs corresponding injunctive relief under\n§ 1983 related to those two orders. We grant relief under\n§ 1983 for the violation of the rights of inmates held in\nadministrative segregation to access to religious services and\nhold that they are entitled to injunctive relief. We hold further\nthat the Stewart order on the provision of religious services\nmay not be terminated. We grant relief under § 1983 to\ninmates in administrative segregation for violation of their\nright to constitutionally protected exercise and hold that they\nare entitled to injunctive relief. We hold further that the Stew-\nart order requiring exercise for inmates in administrative seg-\nregation, subject to that order’s safety-valve provision\npermitting the County to curtail or eliminate exercise for\ninmates that become violent or disruptive, may not be termi-\nnated.\n\n   As to the claims of disabled inmates, although we hold\nthere is no equal protection violation inherent in the disparate\ntreatment of those detainees, we conclude that the County has\nviolated the ADA. Accordingly, we grant relief to disabled\nprisoners on their ADA claims as follows: (a) The district\ncourt must conduct further fact finding on the current state of\nphysical barriers to adequate access to bathrooms, showers,\nexercise areas, day rooms, dining rooms, cells and all other\nareas to which disabled persons should have access and order\n\f                  PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                 5627\nremedial remedies as required; (b) The district court must\nconduct further fact finding as to the programs and activities\ndisabled persons currently have access to and order such\nremedial measures as required to make the County’s provision\nof programs and services, when viewed in their entirety,\naccessible to mobility- and dexterity-impaired inmates.\n\n   Finally, we conclude that Conn suffered physical injuries\nthat were not de minimis as a result of inadequacies in jail\nfacilities. The district court thus erred in dismissing his claims\nof mental and emotional harms. We remand those claims for\nfurther proceedings.\n\n AFFIRMED          IN    PART,     REVERSED         IN    PART,\nREMANDED.\n\f5628             PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n            APPENDIX A (the Stewart Orders)\n\n  The following Stewart orders are at issue in this appeal:\n\nReading Materials Via Mail\n\n    Inmates will be permitted to receive through the mail\n    any newspapers, magazines or paperback books that\n    may lawfully be transmitted through the United\n    States Postal System, subject to reasonable withhold-\n    ing for contraband and security purposes. Inmates\n    may receive hard cover books upon prior request and\n    a showing of particularized need.\n\nMattresses and Beds\n\n    Every prisoner kept overnight in the jail will be\n    accorded a mattress and bed or bunk upon which to\n    sleep. This Order shall not preclude defendants from\n    permitting inmates to be housed with full bedding\n    but without a bunk, for one night only if, in defen-\n    dants’ judgment, said inmate or inmates require\n    more secure housing than is provided in the available\n    areas and the appropriate housing does not have a\n    sufficient number of bunks. This Order shall also not\n    apply in the event of an emergency causing a sudden\n    and unusual intake of prisoners, in which case full\n    bedding shall be provided and defendants will exer-\n    cise their best efforts to provide bunks for all\n    inmates as soon as possible.\n\nLaw Books\n\n    The rights of inmates to obtain law books [through\n    the process established by jail authorities] shall\n    apply to each facility of the jail.\n\nPopulation Cap\n\f                 PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE                   5629\n    Beginning 10 days after filing of this Order, the\n    Sheriff of Orange County will not receive an inmate\n    in the Central Jail any person to whom he cannot\n    (and does not) provide a bed within twenty-four\n    hours after arrival. Beginning 10 days after filing of\n    this Order, no more than 90 inmates shall be incar-\n    cerated in the 8 respective dormitories into which the\n    3-tier bunks have been installed. . . . [I]n the Main\n    Men’s Jail in Santa Ana, California, there will be a\n    population capacity of 1296 inmates assigned to\n    housing. Such housing shall be defined as only the\n    third and fourth floor general population modules on\n    the Main Men’s Jail in Santa Ana, California.\n\nSleep\n\n    The defendant jail authorities are ordered to accord\n    to each inmate the opportunity for eight hours unin-\n    terrupted sleep on the night before and the night after\n    each court appearance.\n\nBlankets\n\n    Whenever inmates in their cells may properly be at\n    ease on their beds, they will be permitted to cover\n    themselves with blankets provided that sufficient\n    anatomy is exposed to establish the presence of a\n    person.\n\nTelephone Access\n\n    The defendant jail authorities shall cause to be\n    installed no fewer than sixteen telephones (in addi-\n    tion to those in operation on January 1978) in loca-\n    tions that the defendants shall determine to be most\n    reasonably accessible to the inmates. These tele-\n    phones, and all other telephones installed for\n    inmates’ use, shall be made available to the inmates\n\f5630             PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE\n    for outgoing calls at reasonable times upon request,\n    subject to priorities of emergency and rotation. Such\n    telephone availability will be accorded inmates in\n    administrative segregation and in medical isolation.\n\nInterjail Communication with “Jailhouse Lawyers”\n\n    The Sheriff shall furnish envelopes for the purported\n    valid purpose [of inmates’ interjail communications\n    with their fellow inmate “jailhouse lawyers”]; . . .\n    may inspect the envelope and its contents; [and]\n    shall promptly deliver the envelope to the addressee\n    unless some sinister purpose is disclosed.\n\nSeating/Holding Cells\n\n    The defendant jail authorities will provide a place,\n    other than the floor, for each inmate to sit while\n    being detained in a holding cell, or elsewhere, before\n    leaving for court or following return from court.\n\nMealtime\n\n    The defendant jail authorities are ordered to allow\n    inmates not less than fifteen minutes within which to\n    complete each meal.\n\nAdministrative Segregation\n\n    Nothing in this paragraph shall interfere with the\n    authority of the defendants to curtail or eliminate the\n    rights herein accorded an inmate in administrative\n    segregation in the event such inmate becomes vio-\n    lent or disruptive in the course of exercising such\n    rights.\n\n    Inmates in administrative segregation will be permit-\n    ted:\n\f         PIERCE v. COUNTY OF ORANGE               5631\nReligious Services\nTo attend regularly scheduled religious ser-\nvices of their own selection once each week\nor, alternatively, to make individual visits\nto the chapel once each week for not more\nthan twenty minutes, or at defendants’\noption, . . . to meet with a bona fide minis-\nter, priest, rabbi, or other similar religious\nadviser at any time upon request of either\nthe inmate or the religious adviser.\n\nDay room\nDaily use of a day room for not less than 2\nhours.\n\nExercise\nRooftop exercise and recreation at least\ntwice each week for a total of not less than\n2 hours per week.\n\nVisitors\nWill be permitted to receive visitors not\nless than twice each week. Such visits will\ntake place at the regular visitors’ facility or\nat such other place as the defendants shall\ndetermine.\n\f</pre>",
