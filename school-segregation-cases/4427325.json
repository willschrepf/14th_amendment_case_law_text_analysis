Appellant Plead Guilty to\nthe crime of Driving while Intoxicated Second. (RR Vol. 3 p.8) Appellant filed in the\ntrial court an election to punishment to be made by the trial court on August\n12th, 2013. The court ordered a pre-sentence investigation. Appellant was\nassessed a sentence of imprisonment for Two Hundred Fifty (250) days in the\nHunt County Jail, $0.00 fine, and $433.00 in court costs on October 14th, 2013 by\nthe trial court. Motion for New Trial was timely filed on November 4th, 2013 in\nthe trial court and has yet to be heard. The court reporter's record was filed on\nApril 26th, 2013. Appeal was affirmed on November 10th, 2014. Motion for\nrehearing was filed on November 12th, 2014. Motion was granted on November\n25th, 2014.\n\f                                          ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nPoint of Error One:\n\n\n                  Defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the officers failed to obtain a\nsearch warrant.\n\n\nPoint of Error Two:\n\n\n                Trial court erred in the admissibility, utilization and refutation of the State's evidence\n        concerning field-sobriety test.\n\nPoint of error Three:\n\n\n                 Trial court erred in allowing Trooper Goodwin to testify that there is a certain level of\nintoxication that can be determined by the HGN .\n\f                                   Statement of the facts\n\n       Appellant pled guilty to Driving While Intoxicated, Second . (RR Vol. 3 p.8). The trial\ncourt admonished Appellant of the charge and the range of punishment. (RR Vol. 3 p.8-15). The\ntrial court then admonished the Appellant that the State was seeking to enhance his\npunishment range from a Class B misdemeanor to a Class A misdemeanor. (RR Vol. 3 p. 8-15).\nThe court informed Appellant that she had the right to have a presentence investigation and\nordered it done. (CR Vol. 1 p. 195). During the sentencing hearing the State moved to admit\nExhibits 1-6 which included the roadside videos, intoxilizer videos and her test results and\nrecords obtained from criminal records from Dallas County. Without objection from the\nDefense the trial court admitted them. (RR Vol. 3 p. 25). Both sides presented arguments and\nthe Court came back with a sentence of two hundred and fifty days in jail. (RR Vol. 5p. 113-125).\n\f                                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n        Jessica Nicole Nance appeals from her conviction, on an open plea of guilty, of driving\nwhile Intoxicated (DWI) second offense. Following a hearing on punishment, the trial court\nsentenced Nance to 250 days in jail. Nance's appointed appellant counsel filed an Anders brief\nin the matter detailing the procedural history of the case, summarizing and analyzing the trial\nevidence, and stating that he found no meritorious issues to raise on appeal. Nance availed\nherself of the opportunity to file a pro se response. Nance contends that she received\nineffective assistance of counsel with respect to each of the following issues: (1) Defendant's\nFourth Amendment rights were violated when the officers failed to obtain a search warrant.\n(2) Trial court erred in the admissibility, utilization and refutation of the State's evidence\nconcerning field-sobriety test. (3)Trial court erred in allowing Trooper Goodwin to testify that\nthere is a certain level of intoxication that can be determined by the HGN .\n\f                                           Point of Error One:\n\n\nDefendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the officers failed to obtain a search\nwarrant.\n\n\n        Requirement of a Search Warrant\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \"The right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nwarrants shall issue\" unless certain requirements are met. U.S. CONST. AMEND. IV; see also TEX. CONST,\nart. I, § 9. This right \"proscribes all unreasonable searches and seizures,\" Gonzales v. State, 369 S.W.3d\n851,854 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012), and its \"basic purpose ... is to safeguard the privacy and security of\nindividuals against arbitrary invasion by government officials,\" Haynes v. State, 475 S.W.2d 739, 741\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1971).\n\n        \"Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does not specify when a search warrant must be\nobtained, [the Supreme Court of the United States] has inferred that a warrant must generally be\nsecured.\" Kentuckyv. King, 131 S.Ct. 1849,1856 (2011). Thus, \"it is a cardinal principle that 'searches\nconducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment—subject only to a few specifically established and well-\ndelineated exceptions.'\" Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 390 (1978) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389\nU.S. 347, 357 (1967)); Gonzales, 369 S.W.3d at 854. \"'Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth\nAmendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police.'\" Brayv. State, 597 S.W.2d\n763, 765 n.l (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1980) (quoting McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 455\n(1948)). The warrant requirement has been described as one of \"the most fundamental distinctions\nbetween our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state where they are\nthe law.\" Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10,17 (1948).\n\n  Judicial issuance of a warrant is important because it \"provides... a more reliable safeguard against\n    improper searches than the hurried judgment of a law enforcement officer engaged in the often\n competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\" Hudson v. State, 588 S.W.2d 348,351 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1979) (quoting United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1,9 (1977), abrogated on other grounds byCalifornia\n  v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 568-80 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted)). A neutral magistrate's\n         prior review \"prevents] hindsight from coloringthe evaluation of the reasonableness\n\f         of a search or seizure.\" United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 565 (1976); see also\nBeckv. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89,96 (1964) (\"An arrest without a warrant bypasses the safeguards provided by\nan objective predetermination of probable cause, and substitutes instead the far less reliable procedure\nof an after-the-event justification for the arrest or search, too likely to be subtly influenced by the\nfamiliar shortcomings of hindsight judgment.\"); Clay v. State, 391 S.W.3d 94,100 n.21 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2013) ('\"[0]ne important function of the warrant requirement is to facilitate review of probable cause\nand avoid justification for a search ... by facts or evidence turned up in the course of [its] execution.'\"\n(quoting Wayne R. LaFave, 2 Search and Seizure: ATreatise on the Fourth Amendment § 4.3(b), at 511\n(4th ed. 2004))).\n\n        \"The exceptions to the rule that a search must rest upon a search warrant have been jealously\nand carefully drawn    \" Jones v. United States, 357 U.S. 493,499 (1958). Those exceptions include\n\"voluntary consent to search, search under exigent circumstances, and search incident to arrest.\"\nMcGee v. State, 105 S.W.3d 609, 615 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). It is the State's burden to show that a\nwarrantless search falls within one of these exceptions. Id.\n\n        In the case of the Defendant Nance a search warrant was never obtained .Although Deputy\nFernandez arrived at the scene at 2:57 a.m and the Defendant wasn't until arrested until 4:30 am at no\ntime was a search warrant ever requested even though the Defendant's vehicle was searched and two\nbottles of empty wine were found (RR. Vol. 4) the car had not been impounded at the time of the search\nnor had a wrecker been called to pick up the vehicle at the time of the search. In fact the car was\nsearched more than once by more than one officer. Although one of the officers testified that he was\nchecking for \"inventory\" it was impossible to check for inventory when the Defendant hadn't even been\nplaced under arrest for any crime nor had she been asked to perform any FST at the time of the search.\nThe officer (Trooper Goodwin) testified to having searched the car only for \"inventory \" purposes\nhowever he had not come in contact with the suspect at the time of the search and seizure to know if\nthe car would indeed have to be impounded.\n\nBurden To Prove an Exception to the Warrant Requirement\n\n        \"A defendant who alleges a Fourth Amendment violation has the burden of producing evidence\nthat rebuts the presumption of proper police conduct. He may carry this burden by establishing that the\nseizure occurred without a warrant.\" State v. Robinson, 334 S.W.3d 776, 778-79 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011)\n(footnotes omitted); see Robinson, 334 S.W.3d at 780 (Cochran, J., concurring); Ford v.State, 158\nS.W.3d 488,492 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). The burden then shifts to the State to prove that the seizure\nwas nonetheless reasonable. Robinson, 334 S.W.3d at 779; Amador v. State, 221 S.W.3d 666, 672-73\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). In this case a warrant was needed to search the car because the Defendant did\nnot give consent for the car to be searched.\n\fExigent Circumstances\n\n\n        '\"We cannot... excuse the absence of a search warrant without a showing by those who seek\n\nexemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made that course\nimperative.'\" Bray, 597 S.W.2d at 765 n.l (quoting McDonald, 335 U.S. at 456). Exigent circumstances\ntypically fall within one or more of three categories: (1) \"providing aid or assistance to persons whom\nlaw enforcement reasonably believes are in need of assistance\"; (2) \"protecting police officers from\npersons whom they reasonably believe to be present, armed, and dangerous\"; and (3) \"preventing the\ndestruction of evidence or contraband.\" Gutierrez v. State, 221 S.W.3d 680, 685 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\n        Nowhere in the record does it state the officers believed the Defendant was armed and\n\n\ndangerous, needed medical attention, or they felt that she was going to destroy evidence. The State\n\nfailed to establish exigent circumstances. The State has the burden to show \"exigent\n\ncircumstances.-.made obtaining a warrant impracticable\"); Crane v. State, 786 S.W. 2d 338, 346 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1990) (\"In order for a warrantless arrest or search to be justified, the State must show ...the\n\nexistence of circumstances which made the procuring of a warrant impracticable.\")\n\n\n        In Douds, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals found that the record did not reflect exigent\n\ncircumstances because it contained no mention of a warrant and because there was no evidence\n\nregarding what the officer knew regarding the time needed to obtain a warrant. Douds, 434 S.W.3d at\n\n855. A finding of exigent circumstances \"must be based on an officer's reasonable belief that the delay\n\nnecessary to obtain a warrant will facilitate the destruction of removal of evidence....\" (emphasis\n\nadded))). No attempt was made to obtain a warrant in this case. Even though there were about half a\n\ndozen officers on the scene in this case and this accident happened almost a hour and 15 minutes later\n\nthere is no indication that officers not on the scene were unavailable to help obtain a warrant.\n\n\nHarm Analysis\n\f         Because the State failed to meet its burden, a harm analysis must be performed. The admission\n\nof evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is subject to constitutional harm analysis\n\npursuant to Rule 44.2(a) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(a);\n\nHernandez v. State, 60 S.W.3d 106 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). \"If the appellate record in a criminal case\n\nreveals constitutional error that is subject to harmless error review, [we] must reverse [the] judgment of\n\nconviction or punishment unless it is determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not\n\ncontribute to the conviction or punishment. TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(a). The harmless error inquiry under\n\nRule 44.2(a) should adhere strictly to the question of whether the error committed in a particular case\n\ncontributed to the verdict obtained in that case. Snowden v. State, 353 S.W.3d 815,821 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2011).\n\n\n         The accident occurred at 2:57 a.m. the Defendant Nance wasn't taken into police custody until\n\n4:30a.m. which gave the officers at the scene more than enough time to request a search warrant.\n\f                                     Point of Error Two:\n\n      Trial court erred in the admissibility, utilization and refutation of the State's\nevidence concerning all of the field-sobriety test that were administered\n\n\n\n\n       Texas Trooper Bubba Goodwin was sworn on August 13th, 2013. (RR. Vol 4\npg.6). At approximately 2:57 am on July 25th 2011 Trooper Bubba Goodwin was\ncalled to assist in a accident. Based on Trooper Goodwin's testimony nance was\nbelieved to be in intoxicated because he could smell alcohol on her, she thinks\nshe is headed \"home\" but she is actually 50 miles away, and the results from the\nHGN task, the one leg stand, the finger dexterity and the alphabet test. (RR Vol. 4\np. 16-17) During examination Trooper Goodwin testified that there is a certain\nlevel of intoxication that can be determined by the horizontal gaze nystagmus.(\nRR. Vol 4 pg. 10 lines 24-25) Trial counsel objected to his testimony stating that he\nisn't allowed to interpret the results. (RR. Vol. 4 pg. 12 lines 11-19). The trial court\noverruled the objection (RR.Vol. 4 pg. 12 line 20-24). Trooper Goodwin testified\nhe didn't perform the walk and turn test because the Defendant informed him\nshe had \"bad knees\". (RR. Vol. 4 pg. 13 1-4). Although Defendant informed\nTrooper Goodwin of her bad knees and Rheumatoid Arthritis she was still asked\nto perform the one leg stand test which is a test that requires a individual to put\nall of their body weight onto one knee. (RR Vol. 4 pg. 14 lines 5-7) Trooper\nGoodwin testified to performing two non-standardized tests. The alphabet and\nthe finger dexterity. He said that Nance performed poorly on both. RR. Vol. 4 pgs.\n14-16) Trooper Goodwin admitted to giving the Defendant instructions to the one\nleg stand that suggest that it was \"ok for the Defendant to put her foot down and\npick it back up.\" What he failed to do was to inform the Defendant that it indeed\nwas NOT ok to put her foot down because putting her foot down was one of the\n\fclues that he was looking for to see if she was indeed intoxicated. (RR Vol. 4 pg 21\nlines 21-25 ; page 22 lines 1-9 and RR Vol. 4 pg 21. Lines 20-25)Trooper Goodwin\nalso testified that the Defendant informed him BEFORE taking the tests that she\nhad Rhuematoid Arthritis (RR Vol 4 pg 23 lines 1-4) He testified that he failed to\ninquiry as to what parts of her body she suffered the Arthritis from. (RR Vol. 4 pg.\n23 lines 6-25)) and he also testified that her ability to stand on one leg or knee or\ncount on her fingers could all be affected by Arthritis . (RR Vol. 4 pg. 24). Trooper\nGoodwin testified that even though the finger dexterity and the alphabet tests\nweren't standardized tests they were still an indicator of intoxication because she\nperformed poorly.{ RR. Vol. 4 pg. 16 lines 4-9)Defendant was then placed under\narrest. (RR. Vol. 4 pg. 16 lines 11-13).\n\n      While a State's witness can testify as to what was observed while\nconducting field sobriety tests and can testify that such tests helped inform the\nwitness decision to arrest a defendant even assuming the Court allows the State\nto adduce testimony regarding the administration of the HGN test and the one leg\nstand in Nance's case Trooper Goodwin shouldn't have been allowed to testify\nthat such tests for example correctly identify intoxicated individuals. See. Tex.R.\nEvid. 705 (b). In the Defendants case the arresting officer Trooper Goodwin\ntestified that the Defendant was over the limit of 0.8. (RR. Vol. 4 page 19).\n\n      In Emerson v. State, 880 S.W. 3d 759, 768-69 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994), the\nCourt ruled that an officer's testimony showing a correlation between a person's\nperformance on the horizontal gaze nystagmus test and a specific blood alcohol\nconcentration was impermissible. A later court applied the Emerson court's\nanalysis to the one leg stand test and it came to the same conclusion as the court\nin Emerson. McCrae v. State, 152 S.W. 3d 739, 746 9Tex. App. 2004). Use of\nimpermissible testimony is a constitutional error because it violates a defendant's\ndue process and fair trial rights under the Sixth Amendment as incorporated\nagainst the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. The appropriate test\nthen is whether the appellant was harmed by the court's error, even though there\nwas an objection and in this case the Defendant was harmed which in this case\nwas ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\f       To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim the appellant must\nshow by a preponderance of the evidence both deficient performance and\nprejudice. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Williams v. State,\n301 S.W. 3d 675, 687 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). Appellant must demonstrate under\nthe first prong that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness under prevailing professional norms. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-\n88; Ex parte Lane, 303 S.W. 3d 702, 707 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). There is a strong\npresumption that counsel acted professionally and that counsel had his or her\nstrategic reasons behind decisions that may appear to be errors. Strickland at 689.\n\n       To meet the second prong, appellant has to show the existence of a\nreasonable probability that but for counsel's deficient performance the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; Ex parte\nLane, 303 S.W. 3d at 707. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome. Jackson v. State, 877 S.W. 2d 768, 771\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1994); Simms v. State, 848 S.W. 2d 754, 756 (Tex. App.—Houston\n{1st Dist.} 1993, pet. ref'd).\n\n       In 1975, NTHSA funded a research project run by the Southern California\nResearch Institute. At that time, Dr. Marceline Burns was a founder and\nresearcher at that organization. The project was to determine if there were,\neither individually or in combination, any roadside tests that could aid an officer\nin determining whether a person was under the influence of alcohol. (See\nStatement Under Oath of Dr. Burns attached hereto).\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to that contract, research was performed evaluating many of the\ncommonly used roadside tests and narrowing the list to approximately 15 tests\nthat were used Nationwide and seems to have some usefulness. From that group\nof 15 tests only 6 were eventually believed to be valid and feasible at roadside.\n(Burns Stmt at 10-15)\n\n       These six tests were then studied in controlled laboratory experiments to\ndetermine their accuracy. (Burns Stmt at 22-24). In the end, a combination of\n\fthree tests were determined to be the best indication of impairment. There three\ntests: horizontal gaze, nystagmus, one legged stand, and walk the line, were\nadopted by NTHSA as the ONLY tests to determine sobriety at roadside. (Burns\nStmt at 7-8).\n\n      Additionally, as Dr. Burns has pointed out on many occasions, variance\nfrom the proscribed manner of administering, observing, and evaluating an\nindividual's performance of the three standardized tests deprives the tests of\nreliability and accuracy. \"Therefore the scoring and the observations don't relate\nto any of the research data or any of the accumulated data over the years. \"\n(Burns Stmt at page 30, line 4-7).\n\n      This position, that only tests given in the \"standardized\" manner, have any\nvalidity is echoed in virtually every police manual regarding field sobriety tests.\n\n      The Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Homan (April 26, 2000) 89 Ohio St. 3d\n421, 732 N.E. 2d 952, held that any variation in the use of the NHTSA\nStandardized Field Sobriety Tests makes the results completely unreliable as\nrelates to probable cause, a lower standard than required for conviction. The\ncourt found \"it is well established that in field sobriety testing even minor\ndeviations from the Standardized procedures can severely bias the results.\" This is\ndues in part, the court reasoned, to \"the small margins of error that characterize\nfield sobriety tests making strict compliance critical\" and \"when field sobriety\ntesting is conducted in a manner that departs from established methods and\nprocedures, the results are inherently unreliable.\"\n\n       Based on the foregoing rationale, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled \" in order\nfor the results of a field sobriety test to serve as evidence of probable cause to\narrest, the police must have administered the test in strict compliance with\nstandardized testing procedures. \" In the case of the Defendant here, Trooper\nGoodwin did not use the three standardized tests. The test the officer did used\n(alphabet and finger dexterity) have not been the subject of any review or study.\nAny tests that the officer did use from the three battery approved by NHTSA were\ndone inconsistently with the prescribed matter. As stated above, such variance\nfrom the standard effectively creates a new test. Based on the foregoing, those\n\ftest do not meet the Kelly test for admissibility. Furthermore, it is clear that the\nstandard enunciated for admissibility in Kelly cannot be met by the prosecution.\n\n      The standard for admissibility of evidence based on new scientific\ntechniques first propounded in Kelly and left unchanged by Daubert is applicable\nto field sobriety tests. Pursuant to the Texas Evidence Code and the decisions of\nthe United States Supreme Court in Kumbo Tire, the Kelly standard is applicable\nto testimony based on training and experience as well as more traditional\n\"scientific\" knowledge. Under that standard, field sobriety tests are inadmissible\nevidence until shown to be in conformance with Kelly which in this case the\nprosecution has failed to do. The tests used in this case do not and cannot be\nshown to meet this standard of reliability and should be precluded.\n\n      Based on the analysis of virtually every state court decision, and hearing or\nreading from the foremost experts in the field of DUI/DWI investigation for both\nprosecution and defense, the United States District Court for the district of\nMaryland \" the results of the SFSTs either individually or collectively, are not\nadmissible for the purpose of proving specific blood alcohol content (BAC) of a\ndriver charged with DWI/DUI.\" U.S. v Horn (D. Md. 2002) 185 F. Supp. 530.\nTherefore, evidence of performance on the SFSTs is not relevant.\n\n      Dr. Marceline Burns, considered by most courts to be the foremost\nproponent of SFSTs (see e.g., Horn, supra), has stated under oath \"What you're\nasking is are these tests of driving? They are not...The officer is not charged with\nmaking a decision about driving skills at roadside. He couldn't. There's no way you\ncan judge somebody in five minutes at roadside that you never saw before to\nmake a decision about their driving skills.\" (Statement of Dr. Marcelline Burns\nUnder Oath, April 17th, 1998).\n      Since these tests, according to their foremost proponent, cannot indicate\ndriving ability, let alone impairment, they are not relevant to the charge of Driving\nWhile Intoxicated Second.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, any testimony with regards to SFTS's is irrelevant\nand should be precluded.\n\f      In the closing of Trooper Goodwin's testimony he was asked by the Court to\nclarify one of the reasons why Defendant was arrested for DWI.\n\n      Court: I want to clarify something in my own mind relating to your\ntestimony about the reasons for the DWI arrest. One of them you said was that\nshe well, let me just ask you the question. I think that I heard her say, when you\nsaid, where are you heading, I think that you—she replied home; is that correct?\n\n   A. That's correct.\n\n   Q. All right. And then when you asked where she lived she said Dallas?\n\n   A. Dallas.\n\n\n   Q. Ifthe accident occurred in Royse City but she was stopped in Hunt County,\n   it's true to say that she was driving east bound on 1-30, which is away from\n   Dallas is that correct?\n\n   A. That is correct.\n\n\n   Q. Okay. And that's one of the reasons you used in your decision to arrest her?\n\n   A. That's correct.\n\n   FURTHER CROSS EXAMINATION:\n\n\n   BY Mr. Brooks:\n\n\n   Q. Based on that, Trooper Goodwin are you familiar with Mount Pleasant,\n  Texas?\n\n  A. Yes sir.\n\n\n   Q. In what direction from the accident—or excuse me your stop would Mount\n   Pleasant be in?\n\n  A. East\n\n\n  Q. On past Greenville?\n\fA. That's correct.\n\nQ. Did you ever inquire of Ms. Nance where she was actually from?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\nQ. Okay. So if she's from Mount Pleasant, that would be the direction of going\nhome, would it not?\n\nA. I asked her where she was going. She said home, and her home was in\nDallas.\n\n\nQ. Actually, what you asked her, was where do you live.\n\nA. Where do you live.\n\nQ. And she said Dallas.\n\nA. Okay.\n\nQ. Sometimes folks refer to a different place as home as opposed to where\nthey live, don't they?\n\nA. Yes, sir.\n\n(RR. Vol. 4 pgs. 29-31.)\n\n    In John V. State, 517 S.W. 2d 536 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975) which has long\nstood for the proposition that being intoxicated at the scene of a traffic\naccident which the defendant was alleged to be the driver was not evidence\nthat the defendant was driving while intoxicated.\n\n   Texas law requires the State to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, a\ntemporal link between Defendant's intoxication and her driving. Here, the\nadmitted evidence did not establish Defendant had a blood alcohol content of\n0.08 or above at the time she was behind the wheel and the circumstantial\nevidence did not establish Defendant lacked the normal use of mental or\nphysical faculties. As a result, no rational fact-finder could have found the\n\f   essential elements of driving while intoxicated beyond a reasonable doubt.\n    Defendants conviction should therefore be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n         According to the unpublished opinion in Gilliand v. State:\n\n         In evaluating legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting (a) DWI\n   conviction, we review all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n   to determine whether any rational fact-finder could have found the essential\n   elements of DWI beyond a reasonable doubt.

App.-Texarkana 2011, no\npet.).\n\f                          Point of Error Three\n\nField sobriety tests were standardized in 1977 by the National Highway Traffic\nSafety Administration (NHTSA) and since then have been taught to law\nenforcement officers on a national basis to determine who is \"Driving While\nIntoxicated.\" The primary NHTSA research was done with 238 allegedly normal\nvolunteers, with three Standard Field Sobriety Tests. The studies suggested that\nthe combined results of 3 failed tests (SFSTs) the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus\n(HGN),the One-Legged Stand, and the Walk and Turn correlated 80% of the time\nwith the subjects' Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.1 mg % or higher. In\n1995, these tests were correlated to a BAC of 0.087 mg % (2) and in 1997 to a BAC\nof 0.05% (3), and the results were shown to be almost the same. Interestingly, the\nresearch never provided a direct correlation with an individual's failure on the 3\nSFSTs and a loss of normal use of either mental or physical faculties.\n\nThey have provided what law enforcement was seeking when NHTSA tried not to\ndevelop a more sensitive test that would provide more reliable evidence of\nintoxication 13.\" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have viewed\nthe SFSTs as a quick, simple, non-evasive way to determine Blood Alcohol\nConcentration (BAC} at a level that they defined as \"intoxication\" for everyone.\nThis brief will review one of these tests, the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)\nTest, and will demonstrate problems in using it as a determinant of whether\nsomeone is accurately and reliably evaluated as Driving While Intoxicated.\n\nBlood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) in fact is not a measure of intoxication, but\nonly of the level of alcohol in the blood at that moment in time. Despite NHTSNs\ndesires and research pronouncements, there are problems with these SFSTs. Its\ninitial support for these studies, however, was guarded because the 1977 initial\nreport included the following disclaimer on the front page. \"Prepared for the\nDepartment of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n,under Contract No. DOT: HS-5-01242. This document is disseminated under the\n\fsponsorship of the Department of Transportation in the interest of information\nexchange. The United States Government assumes no liability for the contents or\nuse thereof, (n)r It is of important note that other NHTSA funded studies by the\nsame primary researcher, Ms. Marcelline Burns (a behavioral psychologist), in\ncollaboration with colleagues at the Southern California Research Institute\n(ANACAPA Science, Inc.), a center she directs, included the same disclaimer.}\n3,5,6,13,14)\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nThe only true way to directly measure Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is to\ndraw blood and to measure the alcohol level in a proper laboratory. Field Sobriety\nTests are indirect, and at best, circumstantial, measures of the BAC.\n\n\n\n\nThe validity of indirect measures of BAC becomes even more suspicious with the\nrealization that it is dependent on the external environment and the individual's\ncurrent physical and emotional state. An individual's ability to perform these tests\ninvolves the functioning of their total body, including their nervous, skeletal and\nmuscular systems. This cannot be assessed without knowledge of the individual's\npast medical history, including physical traumas, and are probably too complex to\nbe done by non-medically trained personnel such as law enforcement officers.\n\nThe original studies documented that between 68% and 80% of the people who\nfailed lto 3 Field Sobriety Tests had a BAC of at least 0.1 mg % (as tested by\nbreath (13), another indirect measure). By adding in those individuals who were\nnot judged intoxicated (ones for whom BAC was below 0.1 mg%), the SFST was\ndepicted to be 90% accurate for all people tested. Interestingly, this 90% figure\nalso included over 20% who tested positive and failed the Field Sobriety Tests,\nand were therefore assumed to have a 0.1 mg% BAC but in fact had a BAC lower\nthan that level. Accordingly, using the SFST in the real world of DWI arrests, these\n\findividuals would have been wrongly declared intoxicated and in turn would have\nlost their license, been arrested and possibly convicted. It must be emphasized\nhere that the study's statistics show that the percentage of individuals who test\npositive but have a BAC lower 0.1mg% got as high as 35% if just one of the SFTs\nwas used.\n\nThe Southern California Research Institute's 90% accuracy claim for everyone is an\nostensively impressive sounding percentage. This claim, however, becomes\ninvalid when one realizes that the BAC was determined by breath testers, another\nin- direct measure with questionable accuracy .This 90% accuracy number\nbecomes further suspect when the BAC was dropped to 0.08 mg % (State of\nFlorida Test) and again to 0.05 mg % (Colorado Test,}(3),because logically and\nrealistically, there would be some change in accuracy, or a higher percentage of\npeople who would test positive as the BAC level is lowered, but the percentage\nstayed the same.\n\nIn most states, when an individual fails the SFSTs and then refuses a breath test,\nthey are assumed by the government to have a BAC greater than the acceptable\nlevel of 0.08 mg%. This means that 20% (1/5) to 35% (1/3) of all people who failed\nthe SFSTs and then refused a breath test would lose their license, although their\ntrue BAC would have been lower than the legal limit of 0.08 mg % if it was done\nby a direct test, such as blood. There is increasing political and financial pressure\nby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for the states to\ndrop the level at which legal intoxication is determined to 0.08 mg % and to\ncontinue to use the SFSTs to measure this level. The Southern California Research\nInstitute (ANACAPA Science, Inc.) has done studies of the SFSTs at the 0.08 mg%\nlevel in Florida in 1995 and subsequently at the 0.05 mg% level in Colorado in\n1997 (2) Their findings, which again combined individuals both above and below\nthe sought after BAC level of 0.08 mg% and 0.05 mg%, promoted over 90%\naccurate information. These percentages again are misleading because they\ngrouped individuals both above and below the sought after BAC level in providing\nthe results. They are suspect because in a normal statistical distribution of\nsubjects, the percentage of people who test positive should increase significantly\nas the level of BAC is lowered from 0.1 mg% to 0.08 mg%, and then to 0.05 mg %,\n\fbut in fact it remains almost the same. Even the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test\nwhich is touted by NHTSA as the most accurate test of all three SFSTs and is not\nsubjected to voluntary control, reflects little change in the percentage of\nindividuals testing positive as the BAC levels drops from 0.1 mg% to 0.08 mg% to\n0.05 mg %.     .\n\n       The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test has been viewed as the premier\nStandardized Field Sobriety Test by the Southern California Research Institute\nbecause it has a claimed higher accuracy rate than the other two tests and\nappears to be totally out of the individual's conscious control.\n\n       To understand what HGN is, it is necessary to review how the test is done\nand what neuroanatomically and physiologically is involved in a positive test\nresult. Understanding this will help explain why there are many other factors\nbesides alcohol and drugs that can precipitate or exaggerate HGN.\n\n      Adams' \"Textbook of Neurology\" defines nystagmus as the \"involuntary\nrhythmic movements of the eyes\". The NHTSA Driving While Intoxicated\nDetection and Standardized Field Sobriety Test Instructor and Student Manuals\ndefine Nystagmus for law enforcement as \"the involuntary jerking of the eyes,\noccurring as the eyes gaze toward the sides.(s,6).\" These Manuals go on to say\"\nnystagmus is a natural, normal phenomenon, they merely exaggerate or magnify\nit.\" Interestingly, the Southern California Research Institute first called this\n\"Alcoholic Gaze Nystagmus, most likely because there are so many other causes\nfor it besides just alcohol.\n\n              In a physiological sense, HGN occurs when the eye follows an object.\n             The slow, natural tracking of the object (smooth pursuit) stops, the\n             eye quickly darts back toward the midline, then returns to slowly\n             track the object a little further to the side, then quickly darts back to\n             the midline, and this process continually repeats itself. This is a\n             normal phenomenon, which should occur in all people as the NHTSA\n             Driving While Intoxicated manuals point out. There are two phases in\n             this process. A slow, tracking phase, or \"smooth pursuit\", in which\n             the eye follows the object away from the center, and a fast,\n\f             compensatory phase, when the eye flicks back toward the midline,\n             the position it had originally started from. The neuroanatomy of this\n             process is very complex and involves the Labyrinth System of the\n             Inner Ear, the Optic Nerve, the Extra-Ocular Muscles of the eye, the\n             Cerebellum of the brain, the Pons of the Brain Stem, as well as the\n             neutral pathways that connect these structures.\n\nThe Retina of the eye must see the object without distortion, and have that\nmessage register in the optic region of the brain. Of the Extra-Oculomotor\nMuscles, the Lateral and Medial Rectus of each eye must be the only muscles\ninvolved in just lateral movement, tracking, and actual Horizontal Gaze\nNystagmus. If other muscles of the eye are used or stimulated, then there is no\nchecking of horizontal gaze. As the eye moves to follow the object, the nerves and\nmuscles send information via neural pathways to the Cerebellum about the\namount of movement, with the Cerebellum then sending back information to the\neye muscles about how much more or less to move, and this feedback process\ncontinues again and again.\n\nThe Labyrinth System of the Inner Ear simultaneously transmits information to\nthe Cerebellum and the Pons about the body's position, trying to correlate that\nwith the information it is receiving from the Oculomotor muscles about the\namount of eye movement, and this process continues again and again. This is very\nfast and very complicated, and it involves multiple feedback loops and transitions\n(1,11,12). Anything that affects these neuroanatomical structures or neural\npathways will influence how Nystagmus will be manifested.\n\n\n\nThe NHTSA HGN Test Itself\n\nThe NHTSA Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test must be done without glasses or\ncontact lenses, and eye problems can invalidate the results. A light or pointer is\nheld 12 inches away from the (face, at the mid point of the eye and slowly moved\ntoward one side and then the other. The individual receives a total of up to six\npoints based on poor performance in three different aspects of the test, although\n\fonly four are required to fail the test, which would determine that their BAC was\nover O.lmg %,0.08 mg %, or 0.05 mg %, depending on the study:\n\n\n\nIThe eye tracks laterally toward the side, and ifthe slow tracking is not smooth,\nthe individual receives one point for each eye that the tracking is not smooth.\n\n\n\n2     The object is then held to the far lateral side of each eye, and ifthere is\njerky movement in that corner ,the individual is again scored one point for each\neye that there is significant movement.\n\n\n\n3     Finally, the angle from directly in front that nystagmus begins is\ndetermined, and if it occurs before a 45° angle, they again receive one point for\neach eye that it occurs in.\n\n\n\nScientific Basis for the\n\nBlood Alcohol Level Influence on HGN\n\nSeveral valid scientific research findings have provided the basis for\nunderstanding that alcohol can influence Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN).\nThese include the Effects of Alcohol on the Inner Ear and the Effects of Alcohol on\nMuscles.\n\n\n\n\n1.    Alcohol Effect on the Inner Ear\n\nReal science has shown that the alcohol level in the blood will be different than\nthe alcohol level in the Labyrinth System ofthe Inner .Ear during the Ascending\nand Descending phase ofalcohol use because alcohol is slow to pass through to\nthe blood brain barrier .This means that during the Ascending\n\fPhase of alcohol use, when alcohol is being ingested, the blood will have a higher\nlevel of alcohol than the Inner Ear's Labyrinth System has. Then, during the\nDescending Period of alcohol use, when alcohol is being metabolized more rapidly\nthan it is being ingested, the alcohol level in the Inner Ear's Labyrinth System will\nbe higher than that in the blood. This disparity between the alcohol level in the\nblood (BAC) and that in the Inner Ear causes the eyes to move in a non-smooth,\nless rhythmic manner, undershoot and then overshoot the target they are\nfollowing which gives a \"jerky • non-smooth appearance called Horil.ontal Gaze\nNystagmus. To the non-medical observer, the eyes have trouble following, or\nhave problems compensating, and appear to act like \"a marble rolled on\nsandpaper\" as the NHTSA Student Manual states,(5,6).\n\n\n\n2. Alcohol's Effect on Muscles\n\nAlcohol is a Central Nervous System Depressant, and as such can have a slowing\neffect on nerve transmission and muscle movements. The effect of alcohol is\nthought to slow the \"smooth pursuit\" or tracking movement of the eye, which wil\nexacerbate normal nystagmus and make it look jerky. This depressant effect is\nthough to increase as one's alcohol level increases, and it is another scientific\nfinding which helps to understand why Horizontal Gaze occurs.\n\nThese two scientific facts explain why alcohol in the blood can cause an\nexaggeration in normal nystagmus, which is the basis for the HGN of the SFSTs.\nThese legitimate scientific findings were then extended by assumptions that the\nSouthern California Research Institute made to validate their own test results.\nReal science and research, however, has also proven that many other factors can\ncause or exaggerate Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus in a non-intoxicated individual..\nIn fact, these other causes of HGN are very important because they speak to the\nvalidity of the law enforcement determination of Intoxication , and subsequent\nrevocation of a Driver's License and/or a DWI conviction. They may also be too\ncomplex, involving so many neuroanatomical structures and be so influenced by\npast and present medical issues, that non-medical personnel, such as law\nenforcement officers, simply cannot accurately perform it.\n\f Other Causes of HGN\n\n Medication\n\n\nAlcohol, its effects, and how to score an individual's performance on the HGN test\nis the primaryfocus of the NHTSA DWI Law Enforcement Training Manuals. These\nmanuals also acknowledged that Barbiturates and PCP could cause Nystagmus\n(4,5) Many prescription medications can also cause or exacerbate Nystagmus, but\nare not usually queried about by the examining officer, including pheny-toin\n(seizure medication), lithium (mood stabilizer), antihis-tamines (allergy\nmedication), and barbiturates (seizure medication). Ofcritical import here is to\nunderstand that although these drugs exaggerate, enhance and cause Nystagmus,\nthey also help the \"abnormal\" person to function normally. If the individual were\nstopped and tested by a law enforcement officer for HGN, as in the case of the\nDefendant they would test positive, although they are in fact on medication to\nhelp them function normally.\n\n\n\nRetina, Optic Nerve Damage\n\nThe Retina and Optic nerve may be damaged sufficiently to cause or to impair the\nHGN test but not be damaged enough to impair an individual's ability to see to\ndrive. Diseases can impair the Macula. This is the central part of the retina, which\nis the part of the eye that has the most sensitive Optic Nerve cells and which\nhelps an individual to accurately focus on an object. Any disease such as Albinism,\nArthritis ,Retinatitis Pigmentosah, Diabetes, and Multiple Sclerosis\" can affect this\npart of one or both Retina and in turn cause or exacerbate HGN. People who are\nborn with eye problems such as Strabismus (cross-eyed) or who have had eye or\nlid surgery may normally have Nystagmus, which would be unrelated to alcohol\nuse(i2). Exaggerated Nystagmus may also manifest in individuals such as miners\nwho have worked in the dark for long periods of time.\n\n\n\nThe Extra-Ocular Muscles\n\fThere are six Extra-Ocular muscles for each eye that move the eyeball itself. These\nare the Medial Rectus and the Lateral Rectus muscles, the ones used in Horizontal\nGaze Nystagmus, as well as the Superior Oblique, the Superior Rectus, the\nInferior Oblique and the inferior Roctus muscles. The NHTSA HGN test is supposed\nto be designed only to test the function of just two cranial nerves (III and IV) as\nwell as just the two solitary, opposing Occulomotor muscles they innervate, the\nLateral and Medial Rectus muscles of each eye(4,n). Those two Occulomotor\nmuscles of each eye are \"yoke\" muscles in that they work together while\nopposing each other .In this manner, one contracts while the other relaxes,\nenabling the eye to move from side to side. In turn, the two eyes must also work\ntogether in order for them to focus on and to follow an object for the test. The\ndisparity between each eye's performances is viewed as an indication of\nintoxication in the DWI Instructor and Student Manual. In fact, any problem with\nthese nerves or muscles can cause an exaggeration in Nystagmus, or a disparity\nbetween one eye's movement and the other .The cause of this could be surgery in\nchildhood to correct eye problems, damage to the muscles of one eye, or even a\n\"lazy eye, \"which will cause Nystagmus, although the individual had not been\ndrinking.\n\nAlcohol, which depresses the Central Nervous System, may affect the smooth\ncoordination of these two opposing muscles and cause a breakdown of the\nbalance between them, which many exacerbate nystagmus. The NHTSA HGN\nexamination is done above eye level, which is what the NHTSA Manuals and\nVideos recommend. This height brings into play the four other Occulomotor\nmuscles (the Superior Rectus, the Superior Oblique, the Inferior Rectus and the\nInferior Olique muscles) and other cranial nerves (the Trochlear and branches of\nthe Occulomotor).\n\nPosition the stimulus approximately 12-15 inches from the suspect's nose and\nslightly above the eye level. Check the suspect's eyes for the ability to track\ntogether. Move the stimulus smoothly across the suspect's entire field of vision.\nCheck to see if the eyes track the stimulus together or one lags behind the other,\nifthe eyes don't track together it could indicate a possible medical disorder,\ninjury, or blindness.\n\fTesting in this manner complicates and invalidates the HGN test because not just\nthe Lateral Rectus and Medical Rectus Occulomotor muscles are being tested. The\ntest as it is taught and as the NHTSA Manual instructs is then invalid.\n\n\n\nInner Ear\n\n\n     An intact Inner Ear Labyrinth System is essential for differentiating between\nnormal and abnormal Nystagmus. Deafness, tinnitus (ringing in the ear).\nMeniere's disease and injuries to one or both ears from trauma or infection will\naffect the inner ear and may damage the Labyrinth System. These changes in turn\nwill register as HGN on SFSTs testing, (i,i2).Law enforcement officers at the side of\nthe road are not trained to and do not take a detailed medical history about\nchildhood illness, past traumas and other medical problems when the individual is\nbeingjudged for intoxication. The individual himself may not even be aware of\nthese medical syndromes or has compensated for them, such that they present\nno problem for the person except when he is tested for HGN.\n\n\n\nNeuroanatomical Structures and Neural Pathways\n\n      The Pons area of the Brain Stem connects many aspects of the Autonomic\nNervous System and the Voluntary Nervous System. It receives and sends\nimpulses from Labyrinth System of the inner ear, the Extra-Ocular Muscles, and\nthe Ocular Cortex where what the eye actually sees register.\n\n            The Cerebellum connects to the Brainstem, and is also part of the\n      feedback system which receives input about nerve and muscle activity, and\n      then modulates or counterbalances each muscle's contraction with its\n      relaxation, the contraction of the others, etc. There are millions of nerves\n      that connect and feed- back messages from the eyes, the Occulomotor\n      muscles, the Cerebellum, the Inner Ear's Labyrinth System, and the Brain\n      Stem. Interference with any of the neural pathways between these diverse\n      parts of the head can cause HGN. Many factors, including vascular\n\f      problems, minor strokes, pressure from tumors, generalized demyelinating\n      diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, infections, and injuries from trauma to\n      the head or neck affect these neural pathways and in turn their ability to\n      send and receive data. Small bleeds (such as those caused by hyper\n      tension), small tumors, and even injuries (such as those caused by minor\n      head trauma, from boxing, automobile or sporting accidents) can cause\n      damage which will result in nystagmus, but would be unrelated to alcohol\n      use. Which in the Defendants case would have been the cause since she\n      was just hit from behind by a 18 wheeler and she had not been checked\n      out by EMT prior to taking the HGN test. Cerebral palsy ,congenital\n      cerebella problems, demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis,\n      Rheumatoid Arthritis and Parkinson's Disease, and even late onset\n      inherited disease can also damage the cerebellum and cause a disruption in\n      the feedback process, which will exaggerate normal nystagmus, and may\n      be seen when tested for HGN.\n\nAnything that interrupts or damages any part of this system, be it from infection\n(childhood or adulthood), including meningitis, encephalitis, an inner ear\ninfection, or even high temperature seizures (1,4), can cause sufficient damage\nfor an individual to have abnormal nystagmus, or HGN, although in most other\naspects of an individual's functioning they are of little consequence.\n\n\n\n      Summary\n\n                   The Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which include the test of\n                   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN), are used bylaw\n                   enforcement as if they were direct measures of blood alcohol\n                   content, initially at the 0.1 mg % level, now at the 0.08 mg %\n                   level and soon at the 0.05 mg % level. The assumption is that\n                   an individual who fails the test is intoxicated by definition, and\n                   the refusal to take a breath test is justification for mandatory\n                   loss of a driver's license in most states. In reality, Horizontal\n                   Gaze Nystagmus is an indirect and circumstantial estimate of\n\f                     not only .but also the presence of alcohol, Blood Alcohol\n                     Content, as are alt other Field Sobriety Tests. Nystagmus itself\n                     is a normal process. It can be exaggerated by the influence of\n                     alcohol and drugs. Nystagmus, however, can also be influenced\n                     by many other factors, including medication to help an\n                     individual function such as in the case of the Defendant who\n                     was prescribed Lithium , their past and present medical\n                     condition in the Defendant's case her Rhuematoid Arthritis,\n                     and the environment they are tested in. These other factors\n                     might cause a person to be judged intoxicated when they are\n                     not, and they are often ignored in SFST testing as in the case of\n                     the Defendant Nance. The process by which nystagmus occurs\n                     is a very complex feedback loop that involves neuroanatomical\n                     structures in the Brain. Inner Ear, Brain Stem, Rectus of the eye\n                     and Extra-Ocular muscles, as well as the millions of neural\n                     pathways that connect these structures. Factors that have in\n                     the past affected the individual's eyes, ears, and nervous\n                     system may exacerbate Nystagmus, and can cause an\n                     individual to fail the HGN part of the SFSTs. Moreover, the\n                     level at which a pointer is held to perform the test brings other\n                     muscles into play and invalidates the results.\n\n       According to NHTSA statistics, at least 20 to 30% of all individuals who fail\nthe HGN test and refuse a breath test will not only unfairly lose their license, but\nalso possibly suffer a wrongful DWI conviction, because their BAC would have\nbeen below the 0.08mg% level used to determine intoxication. They will therefore\nbe arrested for skewed HGN probable cause, but are not intoxicated and should\nnot have been arrested on the basis of the HGN test. They will have \"false\npositives\" and will be assumed guilty, rather than assumed innocent\" The built in\ninaccuracy of these test may well be the reason the U.S. Department of\nTransportation continues to put the disclaimer on each new study they sponsor,\nstating: \"The United States Government assumes no liability for the contents or\nuse thereof.\" (15)\n\fIn summary the State did a \"very sloppy\" job of investigating the accident. They\nfailed to get a search warrant and to they failed to fully investigate what really\nhappened that night. What we have here is a case of a young woman who was hit\nfrom behind by a 18 wheeler who was free to go. He (the driver of the 18\nwheeler) was never asked to perform any sort of field sobriety test unlike the\nDefendant even though he was the cause of the accident. The State used two\nnonstandardized tests that based on research have no probative value\ndetermining if someone is intoxicated. The State used a HGN test that based on\nresearch if certain medical disorders are in to play such as Arthritis or a person\nwho has been prescribed Lithium as in the case of the Defendant those test are\ninvalid as well. And finally you have a officer who asked the Defendant where she\nwas headed and she told him \"home\" he assumed the Defendant was intoxicated\nbecause he was thinking she was lost when in all actuality she was trying to tell\nhim she was headed home to Mount PI easant where she is from. Which in her\ncase would be \"home' to her. Therefore because the State has the burden of\nevidence to prove BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT that the Defendant was\nintoxicated where in this case it is clearly obvious they have failed to do. The\nDefendant prays that this Court REVERSE the judgment and REMAND the case\nback to the trial court and render a judgment of acquittal. In the alternative,\nAppellant prays that the cause be remanded for a new trial or for further\nproceedings in accordance with the law of this Court's ruling.\n\f                               PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, Appellant prays that this Court REVERSE\nthe judgment and REMAND the case back to the trial court and render a\njudgment of acquittal.

I take it throughout this you're still                    8 before, we found adding to that of those six that\n 9 involved in it to a certain degree.                             9 we identified didn't really improve predictions, so\n10         When is the next time you get a                         10 we didn't have four or five.\n11 contract or do a study, or anything along those                 11    Q.

Well, the next time I actually worked                   13 opinion, you want a little backup there?\n14 for NHTSA that involved these tests was with a                  14    a. Well, there's always a risk if you\n15 study of the Drug Recognition Program, of which                 15 rely on a single marker. Now, sometimes an officer\n16 these tests are a component, and that was in 1985.              16 may have to. The circumstances may be such that\n17 That's the only work I directly did for NHTSA,                  17 the only thing he can do is look at their eyes.\n18 except to appear as an expert.                                  18 But let's suppose you have somebody who has a real\n19      Q.   Getting back to the tests themselves,                 19 problem with balance because of some medical\n20 why three? Is there any significance to why -                   20 condition, or you have somebody who has really\n21 you've already told us you found that some of them              21 strange eyes for some reason that I don't know.\n22 were repetitive and things like that                            22 But if that's the only test you have, you really\n23           Can the officer make a reliable                       23 don't have any basis for a decision.\n24 decision based on one test, or does he need all                 24    Q. Now, initially when you did the\n25 three?                                                          25 experiments on these, they were done in the\n                                                         Page 45                                                         Page 47\n 1    a. Okay. One of the reasons for three,                        1 facilities where you have a somewhat controlled\n 2 coming at it from one direction, is officers don't               2 environment?\n 3 have all night to do all the tests in the world out              3      A. Absolutely.\n 4 there. There is a limit as to the amount of time                 4      Q. The overwhelming percentage, if not\n 5 they can invest in any one stop. So the                          5   100 percent of the time these tests are given on\n 6 redundancy —I can't justify the redundancy. If                   6   the side of the road, how much of a factor does\n 7 you're not getting more information, why do more                 7   that play?\n 8 tests?                                                           8      A. That plays a factor mat works —\n 9           Coming at it from the other direction,                 9   well, there's a number of factors working here, and\n10 although Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus is almost as                 10   it works both ways. Certainly, in the controlled\n11 good alone a predictor as all three tests, it's                 11   environmentwhere there was no consequenceto an\n12 kind of a maximum of testing, whether roadside or               12 officer's error, that had to affect the data. If\n13 educational or psychological or medical testing,                13 you look at the data, you can see it did.\n14 that if it's an important decision, you don't want              14        One of the things that I'm often\n15 to base it, unless you have to, unless                          15 challenged on is in the first experiment,they made\n16 circumstances force you to —but you would prefer                16 a lot of false alarms. That is, they said this\n17 to have evidence from more than one test.                       17 person is above .10 when, in fact, they weren't\n18          If you had very disparate results -                    18 If you look at the data as I did, you discover that\n19 let's take anotherfield. If you went to your                    19 their criterion was really .08. In other words,\n20 physician and he had one test that said you have                20 they were saying arrest at the point they saw\n21 diabetes and another that said you have heart                   21 significant impairment.

We had two police officers per day, and            12 which tests do that best. I did discriminant\n13   as I recall, about 15 to 20 subjects, and we ran a          13 function. All of these are very sophisticated and\n14 total of 238. So it took a while.                             14 are done by computer. You don't crunch them on\n15      Q. Again, you've already mentioned                       15 your calculator.

We did.                                             19          It's fairly complex, because one might\n20      Q.

All of the subjects had at least five                    4   balance, you don't gain much by measuring it\n 5 tests. At this time, I don't remember how we                   5   again. So although Romberg, which was one of our\n 6 administered the Paper-and-Pencil test, whether it             6   alternates, is a very good test, an excellent test,\n 7 was just people who had some problem with balance.             7   if you're going to use the One-Leg Stand, you don't\n 8 I suspect we a<hninistered it to everybody, but I              8   really gain enough by doing another balance test to\n 9 trothfully don't recall without looking it up. But             9 include it. It doesn't mean it's a bad test. It's\n10 everybody had the complete set of tests.                      10 a good test. But you have not gained anything by\n11     Q.

Let me interrupt for a minute.\n                                                     Page 17                                                                Page 19\n 1    focus on what you felt was scientifically correct?            i         Could you please tell us what the\n 2       A. I don't recall any instance of them                     2 other three tests were? I'm assuming that three of\n 3    taking exception to anything that we reported and             3 them are the ones that we've been talking about,\n 4    saying \"We don't agree with this,\" or \"Take another           4 and there were three more?\n 5    look,\" no. We're very good research people, so                5      A      Correct I'll probably have to look\n 6    that's not sornething that happens to us.                     6 at my report\n 7       Q.   Plus it must have been a little bit                   7        One of them was the Paper-and-Pencil\n  8 hard for anybody, since you're the first ones going             8 test. We wanted very much to find something to use\n  9 down the path, to say \"You're not going the right               9 when the person says, \"But I have a bad leg -\" or\n 10 way\"?                                                          10 whatever — \"and can't do balance tests.\" So we\n 11      A    That's true and not true. There was                  11 had Paper-and-Pencil actually, a couple. We had\n 12 another large-scale project going on in Finland                12 one and an alternate. Neither one of them proved\n 13 slightly before this. I didn't know about it early             13 workable, All of the other tests had some level of\n 14 on, and so I don't know if NHTSA knew about it                 14 accuracy.\n 15 But in fact, there had been a pretty good and                  15        What we did was take the best ones.\n 16 rather extensive study that was done differently               16 Let me - one of them was the Finger-to-Nose. I'll\n 17 than what we did because they did it                           17 tell you what the other one was. Finger Count, I\n 18 retrospectively by looking at records. But                     18 think. Correct, Finger Count. So there were me\n 19 interestingly enough, they came to the same                    19 three tests that we finally recommended for the\n 20 conclusions independently.                                     20 test battery, Finger-to-Nose, Finger Count and\n 21     Q.

Let me back up a little bit.\n2      Q. My question was, during your initial                                  Obviously, you didn't jump from a huge\n3    ride-alongs and stuff, did you see that there were                 number, from 15 to 3. It must have been different\n4    certain tests that really were sort of folklorish,               stages along the way.\n5    and wonder whether or not they had any basis to aid                      About how long did that process take?\n6    the officer in the decision you just talked about?                  A. You're talking about almost 25 years\n7            For instance, before we started the                      ago. I don't know.\n 8   deposition, I mentioned there was one place where                   Q. Okay. I understand.\n 9   they said they had stopped people and made them                     A. The research began in '75. A final\n10   recite the alphabet backwards, and that had                   10 report was issued in June of '77. I did all the\n11   absolutely no connection.                                     11 traveling, the literature review and the pilot test\n12            Did you discover, in either some of                  12 before we actually began the experiment. So I\n13   the tests that you didn't include in your group of            13 would guess it was probably three or four months,\n14 15, or later on, that there were certain tests                  14 but I don't recall.\n15   where people or officers or the community thought,            15      Q.   So obviously, it wasn't a hasty,\n16   hey, this is a good test to give somebody as an               16 overnight decision.^ It went through the stages you\n17   indication, but it turns out it really wasn't a               17 just described, the initial reading and observation\n18   good test?                                                    18 by yourself, and then some pilot studies?\n19      A. Well, certainly, I observed tests that                  19    A. Yes. And when you perform research\n20   didn't make the cut. Where those tests - you                  20 for the federal government for agencies, they don't\n21 characterized them as folklorish. I don't know                  21 just give you the money and walk away and say \"Let\n22 where they came from. Since there had been no                   22 me know when you get finished.\" There is an\n23 research in this area, since there had not been a           23 overview process. So you're making monthly\n24 big emphasis on alcohol enforcement I don't know,           24 progress reports to them, and they're part of the\n25 but I would suspect they just developed what they           25 decision process and part of the evolvement of what\n                                                       Page 13                                                      Page 15\n 1 found to help them. Because at that point, there                 1 you actually do.\n 2 was no research on the validity and reliability of               2        So if I had said, just arbitrarily,\n 3 these things. But yes, there were tests being used               3 \"Well, I don't like these, and I like these,\" I\n 4 in 1975 which did not make it into the first                     4 would have been called on that. So it's a rigorous\n 5 experiment.                                                      5 process.\n 6    Q. Okay. Now, after your initial reading                      6     Q. Thank you. That was exactly the\n 7 of the literature and some of your ride-alongs,                  7 question I was trying to get to and I didn't hit it\n 8 you've culled down to a group of 15. Then you said               8 quite right, but your answer did.\n 9 shortly after moving it into the lab, some of those              9          So you didn't say, \"I don't like this\n10 were cut out for economic reasons or just                       10 test, I'm not going to bother with it\"; if a test\n11 practicality reasons, like you said, the officer                11 appeared to be a test that was going to make the\n12 not having the time or equipment, or not being safe             12 grade, it stayed in whether you liked it or not,\n13 to conduct some of these tests on the side of the               13 and if it appeared it wasn't going to make the\n14 road, which is the environment the officer finds                14 grade, it got dumped by the wayside whether you\n15 himself in; correct?                                            15 liked it or not; correct?\n16    A. Not quite. Those issues are all                           16     A. That's very accurate. Whether I liked\n17 constraints at roadside. But the reason some of                 17 it or didn't like it, I don't remember having any\n18 those tests were eliminated in pilot studies could              18 strong feelings one way or the other. But in\n19 be one of several. Either they weren't sensitive                19 research, numbers are what make the decisions, not\n20 to alcohol, they didn't discriminate between above              20 your subjective evaluations.\n21 and below .10, or they were not suitable for                    21     Q. To state the obvious, because that's\n22 certain ages or certain conditions. There were a                22 part of the reason why we're here, this was all\n23 variety of reasons why theyjust wouldn't work.                  23 done in what is considered scientifically\n24      Q.   Didn't make the grade?                                24 acceptable means; correct, all these testings?\n25      A.   Didn't make the grade.                                25      A.

Regarding the initial list of    15\n13 three standardized field sobriety tests adopted by         13 tests, you eliminated some of those based on a\n14 NHTSA?                                                     14 variety of reasons.\n15     A.    I don't know that NHTSA uses the word             15            Were there any tests at that time that\n16 \"adopted.\" What they did is they took the                   16   were being given by officers which, although they\n17 findings that we reported to them.

I'm not sure I know how to answer\n22          Now, I've told you about all I know                22 that.\n23 about that because I don't work for NHTSA, except           23        What officers were doing in 1975\n24 as a researcher. So I'm not really privy to all             24 was - there was a lot of variability between\n25 those processes.                                            25 agencies, even between officers and even between\n                                                        Page 9                                                   Page 11\n 1      Q.

Any research project —well, that's a                  11   Indiana fairly early on. I don't remember the\n12 pretty broad statement. I began a project with the          12   exact date. I have to look it up. So 1was really\n13 literature reviewed to find out what the state of           13   puzzled about why nobody thought about how the\n14 knowledge was concerning that topic at that time.           14   officers were going to enforce these statutes.\n15 That was the first thing I did.                             15           If you think about it, if you're\n16          The second thing I did was went around             16   talking about .15, you're talking about a visibly,\n17 various places in the United States and rode with           17   obviously intoxicated person.

Appellant Plead Guilty to\nthe crime of Driving while Intoxicated Second. (RR Vol. 3 p.8) Appellant filed in the\ntrial court an election to punishment to be made by the trial court on August\n12th, 2013. The court ordered a pre-sentence investigation. Appellant was\nassessed a sentence of imprisonment for Two Hundred Fifty (250) days in the\nHunt County Jail, $0.00 fine, and $433.00 in court costs on October 14th, 2013 by\nthe trial court. Motion for New Trial was timely filed on November 4th, 2013 in\nthe trial court and has yet to be heard. The court reporter's record was filed on\nApril 26th, 2013. Appeal was affirmed on November 10th, 2014. Motion for\nrehearing was filed on November 12th, 2014. Motion was granted on November\n25th, 2014.\n\f                                          ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nPoint of Error One:\n\n\n                  Defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the officers failed to obtain a\nsearch warrant.\n\n\nPoint of Error Two:\n\n\n                Trial court erred in the admissibility, utilization and refutation of the State's evidence\n        concerning field-sobriety test.\n\nPoint of error Three:\n\n\n                 Trial court erred in allowing Trooper Goodwin to testify that there is a certain level of\nintoxication that can be determined by the HGN .\n\f                                   Statement of the facts\n\n       Appellant pled guilty to Driving While Intoxicated, Second . (RR Vol. 3 p.8). The trial\ncourt admonished Appellant of the charge and the range of punishment. (RR Vol. 3 p.8-15). The\ntrial court then admonished the Appellant that the State was seeking to enhance his\npunishment range from a Class B misdemeanor to a Class A misdemeanor. (RR Vol. 3 p. 8-15).\nThe court informed Appellant that she had the right to have a presentence investigation and\nordered it done. (CR Vol. 1 p. 195). During the sentencing hearing the State moved to admit\nExhibits 1-6 which included the roadside videos, intoxilizer videos and her test results and\nrecords obtained from criminal records from Dallas County. Without objection from the\nDefense the trial court admitted them. (RR Vol. 3 p. 25). Both sides presented arguments and\nthe Court came back with a sentence of two hundred and fifty days in jail. (RR Vol. 5p. 113-125).\n\f                                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n        Jessica Nicole Nance appeals from her conviction, on an open plea of guilty, of driving\nwhile Intoxicated (DWI) second offense. Following a hearing on punishment, the trial court\nsentenced Nance to 250 days in jail. Nance's appointed appellant counsel filed an Anders brief\nin the matter detailing the procedural history of the case, summarizing and analyzing the trial\nevidence, and stating that he found no meritorious issues to raise on appeal. Nance availed\nherself of the opportunity to file a pro se response. Nance contends that she received\nineffective assistance of counsel with respect to each of the following issues: (1) Defendant's\nFourth Amendment rights were violated when the officers failed to obtain a search warrant.\n(2) Trial court erred in the admissibility, utilization and refutation of the State's evidence\nconcerning field-sobriety test. (3)Trial court erred in allowing Trooper Goodwin to testify that\nthere is a certain level of intoxication that can be determined by the HGN .\n\f                                           Point of Error One:\n\n\nDefendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the officers failed to obtain a search\nwarrant.\n\n\n        Requirement of a Search Warrant\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \"The right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nwarrants shall issue\" unless certain requirements are met.

Based on Trooper Goodwin's testimony nance was\nbelieved to be in intoxicated because he could smell alcohol on her, she thinks\nshe is headed \"home\" but she is actually 50 miles away, and the results from the\nHGN task, the one leg stand, the finger dexterity and the alphabet test. (RR Vol. 4\np. 16-17) During examination Trooper Goodwin testified that there is a certain\nlevel of intoxication that can be determined by the horizontal gaze nystagmus.(\nRR.

(RR. Vol. 4 pg. 13 1-4). Although Defendant informed\nTrooper Goodwin of her bad knees and Rheumatoid Arthritis she was still asked\nto perform the one leg stand test which is a test that requires a individual to put\nall of their body weight onto one knee.

Vol. 4 pgs.\n14-16) Trooper Goodwin admitted to giving the Defendant instructions to the one\nleg stand that suggest that it was \"ok for the Defendant to put her foot down and\npick it back up.\" What he failed to do was to inform the Defendant that it indeed\nwas NOT ok to put her foot down because putting her foot down was one of the\n\fclues that he was looking for to see if she was indeed intoxicated.

(RR Vol. 4 pg.\n23 lines 6-25)) and he also testified that her ability to stand on one leg or knee or\ncount on her fingers could all be affected by Arthritis . (RR Vol. 4 pg. 24). Trooper\nGoodwin testified that even though the finger dexterity and the alphabet tests\nweren't standardized tests they were still an indicator of intoxication because she\nperformed poorly.{ RR.

App.—Houston\n{1st Dist.} 1993, pet. ref'd).\n\n       In 1975, NTHSA funded a research project run by the Southern California\nResearch Institute. At that time, Dr. Marceline Burns was a founder and\nresearcher at that organization. The project was to determine if there were,\neither individually or in combination, any roadside tests that could aid an officer\nin determining whether a person was under the influence of alcohol. (See\nStatement Under Oath of Dr. Burns attached hereto).\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to that contract, research was performed evaluating many of the\ncommonly used roadside tests and narrowing the list to approximately 15 tests\nthat were used Nationwide and seems to have some usefulness. From that group\nof 15 tests only 6 were eventually believed to be valid and feasible at roadside.\n(Burns Stmt at 10-15)\n\n       These six tests were then studied in controlled laboratory experiments to\ndetermine their accuracy. (Burns Stmt at 22-24). In the end, a combination of\n\fthree tests were determined to be the best indication of impairment. There three\ntests: horizontal gaze, nystagmus, one legged stand, and walk the line, were\nadopted by NTHSA as the ONLY tests to determine sobriety at roadside. (Burns\nStmt at 7-8).\n\n      Additionally, as Dr. Burns has pointed out on many occasions, variance\nfrom the proscribed manner of administering, observing, and evaluating an\nindividual's performance of the three standardized tests deprives the tests of\nreliability and accuracy. \"Therefore the scoring and the observations don't relate\nto any of the research data or any of the accumulated data over the years. \"\n(Burns Stmt at page 30, line 4-7).\n\n      This position, that only tests given in the \"standardized\" manner, have any\nvalidity is echoed in virtually every police manual regarding field sobriety tests.\n\n      The Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Homan (April 26, 2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">421</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, held that any variation in the use of the NHTSA\nStandardized Field Sobriety Tests makes the results completely unreliable as\nrelates to probable cause, a lower standard than required for conviction. The\ncourt found \"it is well established that in field sobriety testing even minor\ndeviations from the Standardized procedures can severely bias the results.\" This is\ndues in part, the court reasoned, to \"the small margins of error that characterize\nfield sobriety tests making strict compliance critical\" and \"when field sobriety\ntesting is conducted in a manner that departs from established methods and\nprocedures, the results are inherently unreliable.\"\n\n       Based on the foregoing rationale, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled \" in order\nfor the results of a field sobriety test to serve as evidence of probable cause to\narrest, the police must have administered the test in strict compliance with\nstandardized testing procedures. \" In the case of the Defendant here, Trooper\nGoodwin did not use the three standardized tests. The test the officer did used\n(alphabet and finger dexterity) have not been the subject of any review or study.\nAny tests that the officer did use from the three battery approved by NHTSA were\ndone inconsistently with the prescribed matter. As stated above, such variance\nfrom the standard effectively creates a new test. Based on the foregoing, those\n\ftest do not meet the Kelly test for admissibility. Furthermore, it is clear that the\nstandard enunciated for admissibility in Kelly cannot be met by the prosecution.\n\n      The standard for admissibility of evidence based on new scientific\ntechniques first propounded in Kelly and left unchanged by Daubert is applicable\nto field sobriety tests. Pursuant to the Texas Evidence Code and the decisions of\nthe United States Supreme Court in Kumbo Tire, the Kelly standard is applicable\nto testimony based on training and experience as well as more traditional\n\"scientific\" knowledge. Under that standard, field sobriety tests are inadmissible\nevidence until shown to be in conformance with Kelly which in this case the\nprosecution has failed to do. The tests used in this case do not and cannot be\nshown to meet this standard of reliability and should be precluded.\n\n      Based on the analysis of virtually every state court decision, and hearing or\nreading from the foremost experts in the field of DUI/DWI investigation for both\nprosecution and defense, the United States District Court for the district of\nMaryland \" the results of the SFSTs either individually or collectively, are not\nadmissible for the purpose of proving specific blood alcohol content (BAC) of a\ndriver charged with DWI/DUI.\" U.S. v Horn (D.

They are not...The officer is not charged with\nmaking a decision about driving skills at roadside. He couldn't. There's no way you\ncan judge somebody in five minutes at roadside that you never saw before to\nmake a decision about their driving skills.\" (Statement of Dr. Marcelline Burns\nUnder Oath, April 17th, 1998).\n      Since these tests, according to their foremost proponent, cannot indicate\ndriving ability, let alone impairment, they are not relevant to the charge of Driving\nWhile Intoxicated Second.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, any testimony with regards to SFTS's is irrelevant\nand should be precluded.\n\f      In the closing of Trooper Goodwin's testimony he was asked by the Court to\nclarify one of the reasons why Defendant was arrested for DWI.\n\n      Court: I want to clarify something in my own mind relating to your\ntestimony about the reasons for the DWI arrest.

The studies suggested that\nthe combined results of 3 failed tests (SFSTs) the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus\n(HGN),the One-Legged Stand, and the Walk and Turn correlated 80% of the time\nwith the subjects' Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.1 mg % or higher. In\n1995, these tests were correlated to a BAC of 0.087 mg % (2) and in 1997 to a BAC\nof 0.05% (3), and the results were shown to be almost the same. Interestingly, the\nresearch never provided a direct correlation with an individual's failure on the 3\nSFSTs and a loss of normal use of either mental or physical faculties.\n\nThey have provided what law enforcement was seeking when NHTSA tried not to\ndevelop a more sensitive test that would provide more reliable evidence of\nintoxication 13.\" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have viewed\nthe SFSTs as a quick, simple, non-evasive way to determine Blood Alcohol\nConcentration (BAC} at a level that they defined as \"intoxication\" for everyone.\nThis brief will review one of these tests, the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN)\nTest, and will demonstrate problems in using it as a determinant of whether\nsomeone is accurately and reliably evaluated as Driving While Intoxicated.\n\nBlood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) in fact is not a measure of intoxication, but\nonly of the level of alcohol in the blood at that moment in time. Despite NHTSNs\ndesires and research pronouncements, there are problems with these SFSTs. Its\ninitial support for these studies, however, was guarded because the 1977 initial\nreport included the following disclaimer on the front page. \"Prepared for the\nDepartment of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n,under Contract No. DOT: HS-5-01242. This document is disseminated under the\n\fsponsorship of the Department of Transportation in the interest of information\nexchange. The United States Government assumes no liability for the contents or\nuse thereof, (n)r It is of important note that other NHTSA funded studies by the\nsame primary researcher, Ms. Marcelline Burns (a behavioral psychologist), in\ncollaboration with colleagues at the Southern California Research Institute\n(ANACAPA Science, Inc.), a center she directs, included the same disclaimer.}\n3,5,6,13,14)\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nThe only true way to directly measure Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is to\ndraw blood and to measure the alcohol level in a proper laboratory. Field Sobriety\nTests are indirect, and at best, circumstantial, measures of the BAC.\n\n\n\n\nThe validity of indirect measures of BAC becomes even more suspicious with the\nrealization that it is dependent on the external environment and the individual's\ncurrent physical and emotional state. An individual's ability to perform these tests\ninvolves the functioning of their total body, including their nervous, skeletal and\nmuscular systems. This cannot be assessed without knowledge of the individual's\npast medical history, including physical traumas, and are probably too complex to\nbe done by non-medically trained personnel such as law enforcement officers.\n\nThe original studies documented that between 68% and 80% of the people who\nfailed lto 3 Field Sobriety Tests had a BAC of at least 0.1 mg % (as tested by\nbreath (13), another indirect measure). By adding in those individuals who were\nnot judged intoxicated (ones for whom BAC was below 0.1 mg%), the SFST was\ndepicted to be 90% accurate for all people tested. Interestingly, this 90% figure\nalso included over 20% who tested positive and failed the Field Sobriety Tests,\nand were therefore assumed to have a 0.1 mg% BAC but in fact had a BAC lower\nthan that level. Accordingly, using the SFST in the real world of DWI arrests, these\n\findividuals would have been wrongly declared intoxicated and in turn would have\nlost their license, been arrested and possibly convicted. It must be emphasized\nhere that the study's statistics show that the percentage of individuals who test\npositive but have a BAC lower 0.1mg% got as high as 35% if just one of the SFTs\nwas used.\n\nThe Southern California Research Institute's 90% accuracy claim for everyone is an\nostensively impressive sounding percentage. This claim, however, becomes\ninvalid when one realizes that the BAC was determined by breath testers, another\nin- direct measure with questionable accuracy .This 90% accuracy number\nbecomes further suspect when the BAC was dropped to 0.08 mg % (State of\nFlorida Test) and again to 0.05 mg % (Colorado Test,}(3),because logically and\nrealistically, there would be some change in accuracy, or a higher percentage of\npeople who would test positive as the BAC level is lowered, but the percentage\nstayed the same.\n\nIn most states, when an individual fails the SFSTs and then refuses a breath test,\nthey are assumed by the government to have a BAC greater than the acceptable\nlevel of 0.08 mg%. This means that 20% (1/5) to 35% (1/3) of all people who failed\nthe SFSTs and then refused a breath test would lose their license, although their\ntrue BAC would have been lower than the legal limit of 0.08 mg % if it was done\nby a direct test, such as blood. There is increasing political and financial pressure\nby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for the states to\ndrop the level at which legal intoxication is determined to 0.08 mg % and to\ncontinue to use the SFSTs to measure this level. The Southern California Research\nInstitute (ANACAPA Science, Inc.) has done studies of the SFSTs at the 0.08 mg%\nlevel in Florida in 1995 and subsequently at the 0.05 mg% level in Colorado in\n1997 (2) Their findings, which again combined individuals both above and below\nthe sought after BAC level of 0.08 mg% and 0.05 mg%, promoted over 90%\naccurate information. These percentages again are misleading because they\ngrouped individuals both above and below the sought after BAC level in providing\nthe results. They are suspect because in a normal statistical distribution of\nsubjects, the percentage of people who test positive should increase significantly\nas the level of BAC is lowered from 0.1 mg% to 0.08 mg%, and then to 0.05 mg %,\n\fbut in fact it remains almost the same. Even the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test\nwhich is touted by NHTSA as the most accurate test of all three SFSTs and is not\nsubjected to voluntary control, reflects little change in the percentage of\nindividuals testing positive as the BAC levels drops from 0.1 mg% to 0.08 mg% to\n0.05 mg %.     .\n\n       The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test has been viewed as the premier\nStandardized Field Sobriety Test by the Southern California Research Institute\nbecause it has a claimed higher accuracy rate than the other two tests and\nappears to be totally out of the individual's conscious control.\n\n       To understand what HGN is, it is necessary to review how the test is done\nand what neuroanatomically and physiologically is involved in a positive test\nresult. Understanding this will help explain why there are many other factors\nbesides alcohol and drugs that can precipitate or exaggerate HGN.\n\n      Adams' \"Textbook of Neurology\" defines nystagmus as the \"involuntary\nrhythmic movements of the eyes\". The NHTSA Driving While Intoxicated\nDetection and Standardized Field Sobriety Test Instructor and Student Manuals\ndefine Nystagmus for law enforcement as \"the involuntary jerking of the eyes,\noccurring as the eyes gaze toward the sides.(s,6).\" These Manuals go on to say\"\nnystagmus is a natural, normal phenomenon, they merely exaggerate or magnify\nit.\" Interestingly, the Southern California Research Institute first called this\n\"Alcoholic Gaze Nystagmus, most likely because there are so many other causes\nfor it besides just alcohol.\n\n              In a physiological sense, HGN occurs when the eye follows an object.\n             The slow, natural tracking of the object (smooth pursuit) stops, the\n             eye quickly darts back toward the midline, then returns to slowly\n             track the object a little further to the side, then quickly darts back to\n             the midline, and this process continually repeats itself. This is a\n             normal phenomenon, which should occur in all people as the NHTSA\n             Driving While Intoxicated manuals point out. There are two phases in\n             this process. A slow, tracking phase, or \"smooth pursuit\", in which\n             the eye follows the object away from the center, and a fast,\n\f             compensatory phase, when the eye flicks back toward the midline,\n             the position it had originally started from. The neuroanatomy of this\n             process is very complex and involves the Labyrinth System of the\n             Inner Ear, the Optic Nerve, the Extra-Ocular Muscles of the eye, the\n             Cerebellum of the brain, the Pons of the Brain Stem, as well as the\n             neutral pathways that connect these structures.\n\nThe Retina of the eye must see the object without distortion, and have that\nmessage register in the optic region of the brain. Of the Extra-Oculomotor\nMuscles, the Lateral and Medial Rectus of each eye must be the only muscles\ninvolved in just lateral movement, tracking, and actual Horizontal Gaze\nNystagmus. If other muscles of the eye are used or stimulated, then there is no\nchecking of horizontal gaze. As the eye moves to follow the object, the nerves and\nmuscles send information via neural pathways to the Cerebellum about the\namount of movement, with the Cerebellum then sending back information to the\neye muscles about how much more or less to move, and this feedback process\ncontinues again and again.\n\nThe Labyrinth System of the Inner Ear simultaneously transmits information to\nthe Cerebellum and the Pons about the body's position, trying to correlate that\nwith the information it is receiving from the Oculomotor muscles about the\namount of eye movement, and this process continues again and again. This is very\nfast and very complicated, and it involves multiple feedback loops and transitions\n(1,11,12). Anything that affects these neuroanatomical structures or neural\npathways will influence how Nystagmus will be manifested.\n\n\n\nThe NHTSA HGN Test Itself\n\nThe NHTSA Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test must be done without glasses or\ncontact lenses, and eye problems can invalidate the results. A light or pointer is\nheld 12 inches away from the (face, at the mid point of the eye and slowly moved\ntoward one side and then the other. The individual receives a total of up to six\npoints based on poor performance in three different aspects of the test, although\n\fonly four are required to fail the test, which would determine that their BAC was\nover O.lmg %,0.08 mg %, or 0.05 mg %, depending on the study:\n\n\n\nIThe eye tracks laterally toward the side, and ifthe slow tracking is not smooth,\nthe individual receives one point for each eye that the tracking is not smooth.\n\n\n\n2     The object is then held to the far lateral side of each eye, and ifthere is\njerky movement in that corner ,the individual is again scored one point for each\neye that there is significant movement.\n\n\n\n3     Finally, the angle from directly in front that nystagmus begins is\ndetermined, and if it occurs before a 45° angle, they again receive one point for\neach eye that it occurs in.\n\n\n\nScientific Basis for the\n\nBlood Alcohol Level Influence on HGN\n\nSeveral valid scientific research findings have provided the basis for\nunderstanding that alcohol can influence Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN).\nThese include the Effects of Alcohol on the Inner Ear and the Effects of Alcohol on\nMuscles.\n\n\n\n\n1.    Alcohol Effect on the Inner Ear\n\nReal science has shown that the alcohol level in the blood will be different than\nthe alcohol level in the Labyrinth System ofthe Inner .Ear during the Ascending\nand Descending phase ofalcohol use because alcohol is slow to pass through to\nthe blood brain barrier .This means that during the Ascending\n\fPhase of alcohol use, when alcohol is being ingested, the blood will have a higher\nlevel of alcohol than the Inner Ear's Labyrinth System has. Then, during the\nDescending Period of alcohol use, when alcohol is being metabolized more rapidly\nthan it is being ingested, the alcohol level in the Inner Ear's Labyrinth System will\nbe higher than that in the blood. This disparity between the alcohol level in the\nblood (BAC) and that in the Inner Ear causes the eyes to move in a non-smooth,\nless rhythmic manner, undershoot and then overshoot the target they are\nfollowing which gives a \"jerky • non-smooth appearance called Horil.ontal Gaze\nNystagmus. To the non-medical observer, the eyes have trouble following, or\nhave problems compensating, and appear to act like \"a marble rolled on\nsandpaper\" as the NHTSA Student Manual states,(5,6).\n\n\n\n2. Alcohol's Effect on Muscles\n\nAlcohol is a Central Nervous System Depressant, and as such can have a slowing\neffect on nerve transmission and muscle movements. The effect of alcohol is\nthought to slow the \"smooth pursuit\" or tracking movement of the eye, which wil\nexacerbate normal nystagmus and make it look jerky. This depressant effect is\nthough to increase as one's alcohol level increases, and it is another scientific\nfinding which helps to understand why Horizontal Gaze occurs.\n\nThese two scientific facts explain why alcohol in the blood can cause an\nexaggeration in normal nystagmus, which is the basis for the HGN of the SFSTs.\nThese legitimate scientific findings were then extended by assumptions that the\nSouthern California Research Institute made to validate their own test results.\nReal science and research, however, has also proven that many other factors can\ncause or exaggerate Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus in a non-intoxicated individual..\nIn fact, these other causes of HGN are very important because they speak to the\nvalidity of the law enforcement determination of Intoxication , and subsequent\nrevocation of a Driver's License and/or a DWI conviction. They may also be too\ncomplex, involving so many neuroanatomical structures and be so influenced by\npast and present medical issues, that non-medical personnel, such as law\nenforcement officers, simply cannot accurately perform it.\n\f Other Causes of HGN\n\n Medication\n\n\nAlcohol, its effects, and how to score an individual's performance on the HGN test\nis the primaryfocus of the NHTSA DWI Law Enforcement Training Manuals. These\nmanuals also acknowledged that Barbiturates and PCP could cause Nystagmus\n(4,5) Many prescription medications can also cause or exacerbate Nystagmus, but\nare not usually queried about by the examining officer, including pheny-toin\n(seizure medication), lithium (mood stabilizer), antihis-tamines (allergy\nmedication), and barbiturates (seizure medication). Ofcritical import here is to\nunderstand that although these drugs exaggerate, enhance and cause Nystagmus,\nthey also help the \"abnormal\" person to function normally. If the individual were\nstopped and tested by a law enforcement officer for HGN, as in the case of the\nDefendant they would test positive, although they are in fact on medication to\nhelp them function normally.\n\n\n\nRetina, Optic Nerve Damage\n\nThe Retina and Optic nerve may be damaged sufficiently to cause or to impair the\nHGN test but not be damaged enough to impair an individual's ability to see to\ndrive. Diseases can impair the Macula. This is the central part of the retina, which\nis the part of the eye that has the most sensitive Optic Nerve cells and which\nhelps an individual to accurately focus on an object. Any disease such as Albinism,\nArthritis ,Retinatitis Pigmentosah, Diabetes, and Multiple Sclerosis\" can affect this\npart of one or both Retina and in turn cause or exacerbate HGN. People who are\nborn with eye problems such as Strabismus (cross-eyed) or who have had eye or\nlid surgery may normally have Nystagmus, which would be unrelated to alcohol\nuse(i2). Exaggerated Nystagmus may also manifest in individuals such as miners\nwho have worked in the dark for long periods of time.\n\n\n\nThe Extra-Ocular Muscles\n\fThere are six Extra-Ocular muscles for each eye that move the eyeball itself. These\nare the Medial Rectus and the Lateral Rectus muscles, the ones used in Horizontal\nGaze Nystagmus, as well as the Superior Oblique, the Superior Rectus, the\nInferior Oblique and the inferior Roctus muscles. The NHTSA HGN test is supposed\nto be designed only to test the function of just two cranial nerves (III and IV) as\nwell as just the two solitary, opposing Occulomotor muscles they innervate, the\nLateral and Medial Rectus muscles of each eye(4,n). Those two Occulomotor\nmuscles of each eye are \"yoke\" muscles in that they work together while\nopposing each other .In this manner, one contracts while the other relaxes,\nenabling the eye to move from side to side. In turn, the two eyes must also work\ntogether in order for them to focus on and to follow an object for the test. The\ndisparity between each eye's performances is viewed as an indication of\nintoxication in the DWI Instructor and Student Manual. In fact, any problem with\nthese nerves or muscles can cause an exaggeration in Nystagmus, or a disparity\nbetween one eye's movement and the other .The cause of this could be surgery in\nchildhood to correct eye problems, damage to the muscles of one eye, or even a\n\"lazy eye, \"which will cause Nystagmus, although the individual had not been\ndrinking.\n\nAlcohol, which depresses the Central Nervous System, may affect the smooth\ncoordination of these two opposing muscles and cause a breakdown of the\nbalance between them, which many exacerbate nystagmus. The NHTSA HGN\nexamination is done above eye level, which is what the NHTSA Manuals and\nVideos recommend. This height brings into play the four other Occulomotor\nmuscles (the Superior Rectus, the Superior Oblique, the Inferior Rectus and the\nInferior Olique muscles) and other cranial nerves (the Trochlear and branches of\nthe Occulomotor).\n\nPosition the stimulus approximately 12-15 inches from the suspect's nose and\nslightly above the eye level. Check the suspect's eyes for the ability to track\ntogether. Move the stimulus smoothly across the suspect's entire field of vision.\nCheck to see if the eyes track the stimulus together or one lags behind the other,\nifthe eyes don't track together it could indicate a possible medical disorder,\ninjury, or blindness.\n\fTesting in this manner complicates and invalidates the HGN test because not just\nthe Lateral Rectus and Medical Rectus Occulomotor muscles are being tested. The\ntest as it is taught and as the NHTSA Manual instructs is then invalid.\n\n\n\nInner Ear\n\n\n     An intact Inner Ear Labyrinth System is essential for differentiating between\nnormal and abnormal Nystagmus. Deafness, tinnitus (ringing in the ear).\nMeniere's disease and injuries to one or both ears from trauma or infection will\naffect the inner ear and may damage the Labyrinth System. These changes in turn\nwill register as HGN on SFSTs testing, (i,i2).Law enforcement officers at the side of\nthe road are not trained to and do not take a detailed medical history about\nchildhood illness, past traumas and other medical problems when the individual is\nbeingjudged for intoxication. The individual himself may not even be aware of\nthese medical syndromes or has compensated for them, such that they present\nno problem for the person except when he is tested for HGN.\n\n\n\nNeuroanatomical Structures and Neural Pathways\n\n      The Pons area of the Brain Stem connects many aspects of the Autonomic\nNervous System and the Voluntary Nervous System. It receives and sends\nimpulses from Labyrinth System of the inner ear, the Extra-Ocular Muscles, and\nthe Ocular Cortex where what the eye actually sees register.\n\n            The Cerebellum connects to the Brainstem, and is also part of the\n      feedback system which receives input about nerve and muscle activity, and\n      then modulates or counterbalances each muscle's contraction with its\n      relaxation, the contraction of the others, etc. There are millions of nerves\n      that connect and feed- back messages from the eyes, the Occulomotor\n      muscles, the Cerebellum, the Inner Ear's Labyrinth System, and the Brain\n      Stem. Interference with any of the neural pathways between these diverse\n      parts of the head can cause HGN. Many factors, including vascular\n\f      problems, minor strokes, pressure from tumors, generalized demyelinating\n      diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, infections, and injuries from trauma to\n      the head or neck affect these neural pathways and in turn their ability to\n      send and receive data. Small bleeds (such as those caused by hyper\n      tension), small tumors, and even injuries (such as those caused by minor\n      head trauma, from boxing, automobile or sporting accidents) can cause\n      damage which will result in nystagmus, but would be unrelated to alcohol\n      use. Which in the Defendants case would have been the cause since she\n      was just hit from behind by a 18 wheeler and she had not been checked\n      out by EMT prior to taking the HGN test. Cerebral palsy ,congenital\n      cerebella problems, demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis,\n      Rheumatoid Arthritis and Parkinson's Disease, and even late onset\n      inherited disease can also damage the cerebellum and cause a disruption in\n      the feedback process, which will exaggerate normal nystagmus, and may\n      be seen when tested for HGN.\n\nAnything that interrupts or damages any part of this system, be it from infection\n(childhood or adulthood), including meningitis, encephalitis, an inner ear\ninfection, or even high temperature seizures (1,4), can cause sufficient damage\nfor an individual to have abnormal nystagmus, or HGN, although in most other\naspects of an individual's functioning they are of little consequence.\n\n\n\n      Summary\n\n                   The Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which include the test of\n                   Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN), are used bylaw\n                   enforcement as if they were direct measures of blood alcohol\n                   content, initially at the 0.1 mg % level, now at the 0.08 mg %\n                   level and soon at the 0.05 mg % level. The assumption is that\n                   an individual who fails the test is intoxicated by definition, and\n                   the refusal to take a breath test is justification for mandatory\n                   loss of a driver's license in most states. In reality, Horizontal\n                   Gaze Nystagmus is an indirect and circumstantial estimate of\n\f                     not only .but also the presence of alcohol, Blood Alcohol\n                     Content, as are alt other Field Sobriety Tests. Nystagmus itself\n                     is a normal process. It can be exaggerated by the influence of\n                     alcohol and drugs. Nystagmus, however, can also be influenced\n                     by many other factors, including medication to help an\n                     individual function such as in the case of the Defendant who\n                     was prescribed Lithium , their past and present medical\n                     condition in the Defendant's case her Rhuematoid Arthritis,\n                     and the environment they are tested in. These other factors\n                     might cause a person to be judged intoxicated when they are\n                     not, and they are often ignored in SFST testing as in the case of\n                     the Defendant Nance. The process by which nystagmus occurs\n                     is a very complex feedback loop that involves neuroanatomical\n                     structures in the Brain. Inner Ear, Brain Stem, Rectus of the eye\n                     and Extra-Ocular muscles, as well as the millions of neural\n                     pathways that connect these structures. Factors that have in\n                     the past affected the individual's eyes, ears, and nervous\n                     system may exacerbate Nystagmus, and can cause an\n                     individual to fail the HGN part of the SFSTs. Moreover, the\n                     level at which a pointer is held to perform the test brings other\n                     muscles into play and invalidates the results.\n\n       According to NHTSA statistics, at least 20 to 30% of all individuals who fail\nthe HGN test and refuse a breath test will not only unfairly lose their license, but\nalso possibly suffer a wrongful DWI conviction, because their BAC would have\nbeen below the 0.08mg% level used to determine intoxication. They will therefore\nbe arrested for skewed HGN probable cause, but are not intoxicated and should\nnot have been arrested on the basis of the HGN test. They will have \"false\npositives\" and will be assumed guilty, rather than assumed innocent\" The built in\ninaccuracy of these test may well be the reason the U.S. Department of\nTransportation continues to put the disclaimer on each new study they sponsor,\nstating: \"The United States Government assumes no liability for the contents or\nuse thereof.\" (15)\n\fIn summary the State did a \"very sloppy\" job of investigating the accident. They\nfailed to get a search warrant and to they failed to fully investigate what really\nhappened that night. What we have here is a case of a young woman who was hit\nfrom behind by a 18 wheeler who was free to go. He (the driver of the 18\nwheeler) was never asked to perform any sort of field sobriety test unlike the\nDefendant even though he was the cause of the accident. The State used two\nnonstandardized tests that based on research have no probative value\ndetermining if someone is intoxicated. The State used a HGN test that based on\nresearch if certain medical disorders are in to play such as Arthritis or a person\nwho has been prescribed Lithium as in the case of the Defendant those test are\ninvalid as well. And finally you have a officer who asked the Defendant where she\nwas headed and she told him \"home\" he assumed the Defendant was intoxicated\nbecause he was thinking she was lost when in all actuality she was trying to tell\nhim she was headed home to Mount PI easant where she is from. Which in her\ncase would be \"home' to her. Therefore because the State has the burden of\nevidence to prove BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT that the Defendant was\nintoxicated where in this case it is clearly obvious they have failed to do. The\nDefendant prays that this Court REVERSE the judgment and REMAND the case\nback to the trial court and render a judgment of acquittal. In the alternative,\nAppellant prays that the cause be remanded for a new trial or for further\nproceedings in accordance with the law of this Court's ruling.\n\f                               PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, Appellant prays that this Court REVERSE\nthe judgment and REMAND the case back to the trial court and render a\njudgment of acquittal. In the alternative, Appellant prays that the cause be\nremanded for a new trial or for further proceedings in accordance with the law\nand this Court's ruling.\n\n\n\n                                Respectfully submitted:\n\n                                     Jessica Nance\n\n\n                                    P.O.

Getting back to the tests themselves,                 19 problem with balance because of some medical\n20 why three? Is there any significance to why -                   20 condition, or you have somebody who has really\n21 you've already told us you found that some of them              21 strange eyes for some reason that I don't know.\n22 were repetitive and things like that                            22 But if that's the only test you have, you really\n23           Can the officer make a reliable                       23 don't have any basis for a decision.\n24 decision based on one test, or does he need all                 24    Q. Now, initially when you did the\n25 three?                                                          25 experiments on these, they were done in the\n                                                         Page 45                                                         Page 47\n 1    a. Okay. One of the reasons for three,                        1 facilities where you have a somewhat controlled\n 2 coming at it from one direction, is officers don't               2 environment?\n 3 have all night to do all the tests in the world out              3      A. Absolutely.\n 4 there. There is a limit as to the amount of time                 4      Q. The overwhelming percentage, if not\n 5 they can invest in any one stop.

If                   6   the side of the road, how much of a factor does\n 7 you're not getting more information, why do more                 7   that play?\n 8 tests?                                                           8      A. That plays a factor mat works —\n 9           Coming at it from the other direction,                 9   well, there's a number of factors working here, and\n10 although Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus is almost as                 10   it works both ways. Certainly, in the controlled\n11 good alone a predictor as all three tests, it's                 11   environmentwhere there was no consequenceto an\n12 kind of a maximum of testing, whether roadside or               12 officer's error, that had to affect the data. If\n13 educational or psychological or medical testing,                13 you look at the data, you can see it did.\n14 that if it's an important decision, you don't want              14        One of the things that I'm often\n15 to base it, unless you have to, unless                          15 challenged on is in the first experiment,they made\n16 circumstances force you to —but you would prefer                16 a lot of false alarms.

In other\n     7 the years. So it's not that the officer hasn't _                 7   words, he said, \"You take nine heel-toe steps,\n     8 gained any information; he doesn't have the same                 8   counting out loud, leave your arms to the side,\n     9 pase to refer it to if he changes it.                            9   watch your step, and when you get to the ninth\n    10      q7 So it's almost as if he's creating a                    10   step, pivot on that step and return in the same\nr   11 new test because he doesn't have the scientific                 11   manner.\" The argument beingthat's not the right\n    12   data to back it up on?                                        12   word, and you should tell him to turn around by\n    13       A, Well, he's just not doing it in a                      13   taking small steps.

It did. I don't recall exactly how                    8 like step-wise linear regression where you put some\n 9   long.

We had two police officers per day, and            12 which tests do that best. I did discriminant\n13   as I recall, about 15 to 20 subjects, and we ran a          13 function.

We did.                                             19          It's fairly complex, because one might\n20      Q.

Did you drop any of the six along the                     1            In fact, what the analysis showed us\n 2 way, or did you wait for the entire experiment to              2   is that balance is a good measure, walking is a\n 3 be finished to look at the data?                               3   good measure, but if you've already measured\n 4    A. All of the subjects had at least five                    4   balance, you don't gain much by measuring it\n 5 tests. At this time, I don't remember how we                   5   again. So although Romberg, which was one of our\n 6 administered the Paper-and-Pencil test, whether it             6   alternates, is a very good test, an excellent test,\n 7 was just people who had some problem with balance.             7   if you're going to use the One-Leg Stand, you don't\n 8 I suspect we a<hninistered it to everybody, but I              8   really gain enough by doing another balance test to\n 9 trothfully don't recall without looking it up.

Yes. Although I don't have those                      10 developed any particular confidence themselves in\n11 progress reports, I'm sure what happened was at the         11 what they were doing.\n12 end of the pilot study, in our progress report, we          12          Nonetheless, we brought them in two at\n13 reported the findings on the pilot studies,                 13 the time on weekend days.

The officers didn't see the people\n16 going to conduct the experiment                             16 during the drinking period. They were segregated.\n17    Q.

Plus it must have been a little bit                   7        One of them was the Paper-and-Pencil\n  8 hard for anybody, since you're the first ones going             8 test. We wanted very much to find something to use\n  9 down the path, to say \"You're not going the right               9 when the person says, \"But I have a bad leg -\" or\n 10 way\"?                                                          10 whatever — \"and can't do balance tests.\" So we\n 11      A    That's true and not true. There was                  11 had Paper-and-Pencil actually, a couple. We had\n 12 another large-scale project going on in Finland                12 one and an alternate. Neither one of them proved\n 13 slightly before this. I didn't know about it early             13 workable, All of the other tests had some level of\n 14 on, and so I don't know if NHTSA knew about it                 14 accuracy.\n 15 But in fact, there had been a pretty good and                  15        What we did was take the best ones.\n 16 rather extensive study that was done differently               16 Let me - one of them was the Finger-to-Nose. I'll\n 17 than what we did because they did it                           17 tell you what the other one was. Finger Count, I\n 18 retrospectively by looking at records. But                     18 think. Correct, Finger Count. So there were me\n 19 interestingly enough, they came to the same                    19 three tests that we finally recommended for the\n 20 conclusions independently.                                     20 test battery, Finger-to-Nose, Finger Count and\n 21     Q.

Let me back up a little bit.\n2      Q. My question was, during your initial                                  Obviously, you didn't jump from a huge\n3    ride-alongs and stuff, did you see that there were                 number, from 15 to 3. It must have been different\n4    certain tests that really were sort of folklorish,               stages along the way.\n5    and wonder whether or not they had any basis to aid                      About how long did that process take?\n6    the officer in the decision you just talked about?                  A. You're talking about almost 25 years\n7            For instance, before we started the                      ago. I don't know.\n 8   deposition, I mentioned there was one place where                   Q. Okay. I understand.\n 9   they said they had stopped people and made them                     A. The research began in '75. A final\n10   recite the alphabet backwards, and that had                   10 report was issued in June of '77. I did all the\n11   absolutely no connection.                                     11 traveling, the literature review and the pilot test\n12            Did you discover, in either some of                  12 before we actually began the experiment. So I\n13   the tests that you didn't include in your group of            13 would guess it was probably three or four months,\n14 15, or later on, that there were certain tests                  14 but I don't recall.\n15   where people or officers or the community thought,            15      Q.   So obviously, it wasn't a hasty,\n16   hey, this is a good test to give somebody as an               16 overnight decision.^ It went through the stages you\n17   indication, but it turns out it really wasn't a               17 just described, the initial reading and observation\n18   good test?                                                    18 by yourself, and then some pilot studies?\n19      A. Well, certainly, I observed tests that                  19    A. Yes. And when you perform research\n20   didn't make the cut. Where those tests - you                  20 for the federal government for agencies, they don't\n21 characterized them as folklorish. I don't know                  21 just give you the money and walk away and say \"Let\n22 where they came from. Since there had been no                   22 me know when you get finished.\" There is an\n23 research in this area, since there had not been a           23 overview process. So you're making monthly\n24 big emphasis on alcohol enforcement I don't know,           24 progress reports to them, and they're part of the\n25 but I would suspect they just developed what they           25 decision process and part of the evolvement of what\n                                                       Page 13                                                      Page 15\n 1 found to help them. Because at that point, there                 1 you actually do.\n 2 was no research on the validity and reliability of               2        So if I had said, just arbitrarily,\n 3 these things. But yes, there were tests being used               3 \"Well, I don't like these, and I like these,\" I\n 4 in 1975 which did not make it into the first                     4 would have been called on that. So it's a rigorous\n 5 experiment.                                                      5 process.\n 6    Q. Okay. Now, after your initial reading                      6     Q. Thank you. That was exactly the\n 7 of the literature and some of your ride-alongs,                  7 question I was trying to get to and I didn't hit it\n 8 you've culled down to a group of 15. Then you said               8 quite right, but your answer did.\n 9 shortly after moving it into the lab, some of those              9          So you didn't say, \"I don't like this\n10 were cut out for economic reasons or just                       10 test, I'm not going to bother with it\"; if a test\n11 practicality reasons, like you said, the officer                11 appeared to be a test that was going to make the\n12 not having the time or equipment, or not being safe             12 grade, it stayed in whether you liked it or not,\n13 to conduct some of these tests on the side of the               13 and if it appeared it wasn't going to make the\n14 road, which is the environment the officer finds                14 grade, it got dumped by the wayside whether you\n15 himself in; correct?                                            15 liked it or not; correct?\n16    A. Not quite. Those issues are all                           16     A. That's very accurate. Whether I liked\n17 constraints at roadside.
