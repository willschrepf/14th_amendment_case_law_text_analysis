The parties presented a number of issues for our consideration,\nincluding whether the district court erred in (l) finding that unitary\nstatus had been achieved and awarding attorneys’ fees to plaintiff-\nintervenors based on this finding; (2) holding that the establishment\nof a magnet schools program was an ultra vires, unconstitutional act\njustifying an award of nominal damages and attorneys’ fees; (3)\nenjoining the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board from considering\nrace in the future assignment of students or allocation of educational\nresources; and (4) sanctioning the Board for failing to comply with\nthe district court’s discovery order.\n\n   Having considered the briefs and arguments of the parties, a major-\nity of the Court holds: (1) by a 7-4 vote (Chief Judge Wilkinson and\nJudges Widener, Wilkins, Niemeyer, Luttig, Williams and Traxler in\nthe affirmative), the school system has achieved unitary status, but by\na 6-5 vote (Chief Judge Wilkinson and Judges Niemeyer, Michael,\nMotz, King and Gregory in the affirmative) attorneys’ fees for work\ndone on the unitary status issue are denied; (2) by a 6-5 vote (Chief\nJudge Wilkinson and Judges Niemeyer, Michael, Motz, King, and\nGregory in the affirmative), the Board did not forfeit its immunity for\nthe establishment of the magnet schools program, and nominal dam-\nages and attorneys’ fees in that regard are denied; (3) by a unanimous\nvote, the injunction is vacated; and (4) by a unanimous vote, the\nimposition of sanctions is affirmed.\n\n   The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed on the find-\ning of unitary status and the imposition of sanctions, reversed as to\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      7\nthe finding of liability for nominal damages for the establishment of\nthe magnet schools program, reversed as to the imposition of attor-\nneys’ fees for any reason, and reversed on the issuance of the injunc-\ntion.\n\n   Unitary status having been achieved, the judgment of the district\ncourt vacating and dissolving all prior injunctive orders and decrees\nis affirmed. The Board is to operate the school system without the\nstrictures of these decrees no later than the 2002-2003 school year.\n\n                   AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\n\nTRAXLER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   This case is hopefully the final chapter in the saga of federal court\ncontrol over the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (\"CMS\"). Since\n1971 CMS has operated under a federally supervised desegregation\nplan that included limited use of racial ratios, pairing and grouping of\nschool zones, and extensive busing. So successful was the plan that\nthe district court removed the case from the active docket in 1975,\nexpressing its belief that the once reluctant school board was commit-\nted to achieving desegregation and was already well on the way\ntoward a unitary school system. Since then, two generations of stu-\ndents have passed through CMS and, until the present case, not one\nperson has returned to court alleging that segregative practices have\nbeen continued or revived.\n\n   Now, nearly three decades later and prompted by a lawsuit filed by\na white student challenging the magnet schools admissions policy, the\nquestion of whether CMS has achieved unitary status has been placed\nbefore our courts. In 1999, the district court, after a lengthy hearing\nand searching inquiry, concluded that CMS had indeed achieved uni-\ntary status by eliminating the vestiges of past discrimination to the\nextent practicable. This conclusion was not reached in haste; it was\nthe result of a two-month hearing and an examination of extensive\ntestimony and evidence relating to every aspect of CMS’s educational\nsystem.\n\n   A majority of this court now affirms the district court’s holding on\nthis issue, satisfied that CMS has dismantled the dual school system.\n\f8       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nIn sharp contrast to the situation in the late 1960s, when black stu-\ndents were segregated in black schools and taught by a predominantly\nblack staff, CMS students today are educated in an integrated envi-\nronment by an integrated faculty. Nor do we turn over control to an\nindecisive and uncommitted school board. CMS currently operates\nunder the firm guidance of an integrated school board which has\nclearly demonstrated its commitment to a desegregated school sys-\ntem.\n\n   In sum, the \"end purpose\" of federal intervention to remedy segre-\ngation has been served, and it is time to complete the task with which\nwe were charged—to show confidence in those who have achieved\nthis success and to restore to state and local authorities the control of\ntheir school system. Consequently, a majority of this court affirms the\ndistrict court’s unitary status determination.\n\n   However, while a majority of my colleagues agree that CMS has\nachieved unitary status, and have graciously joined me on this point,\nI respectfully depart from a separate majority’s decision to reverse the\ndistrict court’s holding that CMS’s magnet schools program, which\nwas implemented in 1992, was an ultra vires, unconstitutional act jus-\ntifying an award of nominal damages and attorney fees. By denying\nchildren, on account of their race, an equal opportunity to compete for\nopen, unclaimed slots in CMS’s extraordinary magnet program, I\nbelieve the school board pushed too far and did more than either was\nrequired or permitted. Just as the educational process of the 1960s\nunconstitutionally deprived black children of educational opportuni-\nties solely on account of their race, the magnet schools admissions\npolicy deprives white children of educational opportunities solely on\naccount of their race. Consequently, I depart from the separate major-\nity in that I would affirm the district court’s conclusion that the mag-\nnet schools program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment and the liability of the school board for the\nviolation.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   In 1896, the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana statute \"providing\nfor separate railway carriages for the white and colored races.\" Plessy\nv. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 540 (1896). The Plessy majority charac-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      9\nterized the statute as \"not necessarily imply[ing] the inferiority of\neither race,\" id. at 544, but the first Justice Harlan, in dissent, aptly\ndescribed the true aim of the law: \"Everyone knows that the statute\nin question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white\npersons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored\npeople from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons,\" id.\nat 557 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan further \"den[ied] that\nany legislative body or judicial tribunal may have regard to the race\nof citizens when the civil rights of those citizens are involved.\" Id. at\n554-55 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Unfortunately, the principle of \"sepa-\nrate but equal\" reached much farther than Louisiana railways, and was\napplied to other public services, including education. The march of\nprogress eventually proved the correctness of Justice Harlan’s princi-\npled stand. Segregation, in all of its manifestations, was \"arbitrary\"\nand \"wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality\nbefore the law established by the Constitution.\" Id. at 561-62 (Harlan,\nJ., dissenting).\n\n   Early efforts aimed at combating the injustice wrought by Plessy\nin educational settings often centered on state-funded graduate and\nprofessional schools. See, e.g., Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada,\n305 U.S. 337 (1938); see generally Mark V. Tushnet, The NAACP’s\nLegal Strategy Against Segregated Education 1925-1950 (1987). In\nGaines, an African-American student was denied admission to the\nUniversity of Missouri School of Law on account of his race. Mis-\nsouri had no \"separate but equal\" law school for its African-American\ncitizens and instead offered to pay Gaines’ tuition and expenses for\na legal education in another state. The Supreme Court held that Mis-\nsouri’s offer denied Gaines equal protection of the laws. The Court\nobserved that \"[t]he admissibility of laws separating the races in the\nenjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the\nequality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups\nwithin the State.\" Gaines, 305 U.S. at 349. Though providing only\nsmall victories, cases like Gaines exposed \"separate but equal\" for the\nuntenable proposition that it was.\n\n   In 1954, the Supreme Court recognized the futility of measuring\nequality in segregated facilities. See Brown v. Board of Educ., 347\nU.S. 483 (1954) (Brown I). Presented with a direct attack on Plessy\nin a secondary education case, the Court held that \"segregation of\n\f10      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nchildren in public schools solely on the basis of race\" violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 493.\nThe Court emphasized that an educational \"opportunity, where a state\nhas undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available\nto all on equal terms.\" Id. Recognizing that segregation differed from\nlocality to locality, the Supreme Court subsequently declined to craft\na broad, one-size-fits-all remedy, and instead instructed the federal\ndistrict courts to oversee the implementation of appropriate relief\nbased on the dictates of local circumstances. See Brown v. Board of\nEduc., 349 U.S. 294, 299 (1955) (Brown II) (\"Because of their prox-\nimity to local conditions and the possible need for further hearings,\nthe courts which originally heard these cases can best perform th[e]\njudicial appraisal.\"). The district courts were directed to make use of\nthe \"traditional attributes of equity power,\" id. at 300, to ensure that\nstudents were \"admit[ted] to public schools on a racially nondiscrimi-\nnatory basis,\" id. at 301. However, under the Brown opinions it was\nunclear whether a school district was required to take affirmative\nsteps to remedy the constitutional violation, see, e.g., Briggs v. Elliott,\n132 F. Supp. 776, 777 (E.D.S.C. 1955) (holding that Brown merely\nprohibited school districts from using the force of law to separate the\nraces), and very little progress resulted.\n\n   Before the Supreme Court provided further guidance to the lower\nfederal courts, in 1965 the Swann plaintiffs, who were the original\nclass action plaintiffs representing the interests of African-American\nchildren in the district, challenged as constitutionally inadequate the\nefforts of CMS in complying with Brown. The school district’s deseg-\nregation plan was based on freedom of choice whereby \"any child,\nwithout regard to race, and without regard to minority or majority of\nrace in any particular school, might freely transfer to another school\nof his choice.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 243 F.\nSupp. 667, 668 (W.D.N.C. 1965). The district court approved the\nplan, observing that more could be done \"to increase mixing of the\nraces,\" but that the law imposed \"no such duty upon . . . the School\nBoard.\" Id. at 670.\n\n   Concerned at the slow pace of school desegregation throughout the\nnation, the Supreme Court held in 1968 that school boards had an \"af-\nfirmative duty\" to end the state-imposed dual system of education.\nGreen v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 437 (1968). The Justices\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     11\nunderscored that \"in desegregating a dual system a plan utilizing\n‘freedom of choice’ is not an end in itself.\" Id. at 440. The Swann\nplaintiffs then filed in the district court a motion for further relief\n\"seek[ing] greater speed in desegregation of the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg schools, and request[ing] elimination of certain other\nalleged racial inequalities.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 300 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (W.D.N.C. 1969). The district court,\nguided by the mandate of Green, see Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1362,\nmade a number of factual findings and concluded that the school dis-\ntrict remained highly segregated.\n   The district court noted that over half of CMS’s 24,000 African-\nAmerican students \"attend schools that are all black, or very nearly\nall black, and most of the 24,000 have no white teachers.\" Id. at 1360.\nHowever, the court found no violations \"in the use of federal funds;\nthe use of mobile classrooms; quality of school buildings and facili-\nties; athletics; PTA activities; school fees; free lunches; books; elec-\ntive courses; nor in individual evaluation of students.\" Id. at 1372.\n   The district court directed CMS to submit \"a positive plan for fac-\nulty desegregation effective in the fall of 1969, and a plan for effec-\ntive desegregation of pupil population, to be predominantly effective\nin the fall of 1969 and to be completed by the fall of 1970.\" Id. at\n1360. The board procrastinated, but eventually submitted an ener-\nvated desegregation plan that the district court approved \"with great\nreluctance\" on a temporary basis. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nBd. of Educ., 306 F. Supp. 1291, 1298 (W.D.N.C. 1969). CMS offi-\ncials, however, continued to drag their feet, and the district court was\nforced to appoint its own expert, Dr. John A. Finger, to craft an effi-\ncacious desegregation plan. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265 (W.D.N.C. 1970). Dr. Finger’s plan,\nadopted by the district court, included limited use of mathematical\nratios, pairing and grouping of school zones, and busing. See id. We\naffirmed a portion of the plan, but vacated provisions dealing with the\nbusing of elementary school students because of the perceived bur-\ndens on small children and the cost of purchasing new buses. See\nSwann v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 431 F.2d 138, 147\n(4th. Cir. 1970) (en banc). We remanded \"for reconsideration of the\nassignment of pupils in the elementary schools.\" Id. The Supreme\nCourt granted certiorari and reinstated the district court’s plan pend-\ning further proceedings. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\n\f12      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nEduc., 399 U.S. 926 (1970). The district court conducted eight days\nof hearings and examined five different desegregation plans. The dis-\ntrict court concluded the Finger plan to be the best of the five, encom-\npassing \"a reasonable . . . collection of methods for solving the\nproblem\" of the dual system. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 318 F. Supp. 786, 800 (W.D.N.C. 1970). As for busing and the\ncost of new buses, the district court found that the Finger plan took\n\"proper advantage of traffic movement\" and that new buses would\ncost only $660,000, a far cry from the millions of dollars that CMS\nhad originally estimated. See id. at 797-98. Two months later, the\nSupreme Court granted certiorari and undertook an in-depth review\nof the power of the federal district courts to craft such sweeping\ndesegregation remedies. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 402 U.S. 1 (1971).\n\n   The Supreme Court affirmed the desegregation plan adopted by the\ndistrict court, and in the course of its opinion identified and offered\nguidance in \"four problem areas.\" Id. at 22. First, the Court addressed\nthe issue of the district court’s use of racial ratios. While the Supreme\nCourt approved of a limited use of mathematical ratios in a plan\ncrafted by a district court, it emphasized that such ratios were \"a start-\ning point . . . rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 25. The\nCourt reminded district courts that \"[t]he constitutional command to\ndesegregate schools does not mean that every school in every commu-\nnity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system\nas a whole.\" Id. at 24. Second, the Court dealt with single-race\nschools. Though the Court concluded that schools consisting of pre-\ndominantly one race were not per se unconstitutional, the Court\ninstructed the district courts to utilize \"close scrutiny to determine that\nschool assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation.\" Id. at\n26. Third, the Court considered alterations of attendance zones. The\nCourt held \"that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school\nzones is a permissible tool,\" id. at 28, but declined to craft \"rigid\nrules\" in light of differing local circumstances, id. at 29. Finally, the\nCourt tackled the busing issue. The Court confirmed that a district\ncourt could order \"bus transportation as one tool of school desegrega-\ntion,\" but within reasonable time and distance restrictions. Id. at 30.\n\n   Shortly after the Supreme Court issued its landmark Swann opin-\nion, CMS asked the district court to abandon the Finger plan and per-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     13\nmit the substitution of a \"feeder plan\" whereby schools would draw\npupils from designated attendance areas in an effort to keep children\ntogether for their entire public school career. See Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346 (W.D.N.C. 1971). Cit-\ning concerns of resegregation and the placement of additional burdens\non African-American children, the district court questioned the feeder\nplan. See id. at 1350-53. CMS then withdrew its original feeder plan\nand began work on a modified version. See id. at 1353. The district\ncourt eventually approved a revised feeder plan that reopened several\nformer black schools and prevented over- and under-utilization of\nfacilities. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 334 F.\nSupp. 623 (W.D.N.C. 1971).\n\n   However, within just two years it became clear that CMS’s revised\nfeeder plan was inadequate \"for dealing with foreseeable problems\"\nin the dismantling of the dual system. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 362 F. Supp. 1223, 1229 (W.D.N.C.\n1973). The district court found \"that various formerly black schools\nand other schools will turn black under the feeder plan,\" id., and that\n\"[r]acial discrimination through official action has not ended in this\nschool system,\" id. at 1230. The district court again instructed CMS\nto design a new pupil assignment plan \"on the premise that equal pro-\ntection of laws is here to stay.\" Id. at 1238.\n\n   In 1974 CMS adopted and the district court approved new guide-\nlines and policies for pupil assignment. See Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 379 F. Supp. 1102 (W.D.N.C. 1974). The\nplan was designed by a citizens advisory group working with the\nboard in an effort to reach \"an acceptable consensus\" on school deseg-\nregation in CMS. Id. at 1103. The plan’s most promising features\nwere the avoidance of any majority black schools (with the exception\nof Hidden Valley, an exempted school), and a more equal distribution\nof the busing burden. See id. at 1105 1110. Praising the board for\nmaking \"a clean break with the essentially ‘reluctant’ attitude which\ndominated Board actions for many years,\" the district court predicted\nthat the policies and positive attitude would eventually result in a uni-\ntary school system. Id. at 1103.\n\n   The district court closed Swann in 1975 and removed the case from\nthe active docket. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,\n\f14      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n67 F.R.D. 648 (W.D.N.C. 1975). In so doing, the district court\nobserved that the board was \"actively and intelligently addressing\"\nrecurrent problems related to dismantlement of the dual system. Id. at\n649. The district court was so satisfied with the progress being made\nthat it questioned whether it would ever be confronted with a motion\nto reopen the litigation. See id.\n\n   For three years there was no action in the case. This changed in\n1978 when a group of white parents sought to enjoin CMS from reas-\nsigning over 4000 students in an effort to maintain racial balance in\ncertain schools. See Martin v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,\n475 F. Supp. 1318 (W.D.N.C. 1979). The parents attacking the 1978\nstudent assignment plan \"offered no live evidence but offered and\nrelied upon a few written exhibits and admissions from the plead-\nings.\" Id. at 1321. Not surprisingly, the district court rejected the par-\nents’ challenge to the student assignment plan and praised CMS for\nits zeal in dismantling the dual system.\n\n   In 1980, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs again returned to the dis-\ntrict court. The parties informed the district court that the African-\nAmerican student population in CMS’s elementary schools had grown\nfrom twenty-nine percent to forty percent, making it difficult to avoid\npredominantly black student bodies. To provide the board with some\nflexibility, the district court permitted operation of elementary schools\nwith African-American student bodies of plus fifteen percent above\nthe district-wide average. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., No. 1974 (W.D.N.C. Apr. 17, 1980).\n\n   Since 1980, neither the board nor the Swann plaintiffs have\napproached the district court regarding alteration of the earlier deseg-\nregation orders. And, until the present litigation, the Swann plaintiffs\nhave never attempted to reopen the case in order to address any\nalleged failure by the board to comply with the district court’s deseg-\nregation orders.\n\n   The controversy before us today arose in September 1997 when\nWilliam Capacchione (\"Capacchione\") filed suit against CMS on\nbehalf of his daughter, Cristina, alleging that she had been unconstitu-\ntionally denied admission to a magnet school program on account of\nher race. In 1992, without prior court approval, CMS had adopted a\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      15\ndesegregation plan focused mainly on the use of magnet schools. In\nfilling magnet schools, CMS had instituted a black and a non-black\nlottery to achieve racial balance. If a sufficient number of blacks or\nwhites did not apply and fill the seats allotted to their respective races,\nthen CMS would actively recruit children of the desired race despite\nlengthy waiting lists made up of children of the other race. If the\nrecruitment drive failed, CMS usually left the available slots vacant.\nCristina, who is white, was placed on a waiting list and eventually\ndenied admission to a program at the Olde Providence magnet school,\nwhich CMS marketed as \"a school to benefit everyone.\" J.A. XXXII-\n15,670.\n\n   The original Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann and to\nconsolidate it with Capacchione’s suit. They asserted that the vestiges\nof the dual school system had not been abolished and that the use of\nrace in the magnet admissions policy was necessary for the school\ndistrict to comply with the prior desegregation orders. The district\ncourt granted the motion and later permitted Capacchione to intervene\nin the Swann litigation. Seeking a finding that CMS had eradicated\nthe vestiges of past discrimination, another group of parents, led by\nMichael P. Grant (\"Grant\"),1 was also permitted to intervene in the lit-\nigation.\n\n   After a two-month bench trial, the district court determined that\nCMS had achieved unitary status, that the race-based admissions pol-\nicy for CMS’s magnet schools fell outside prior orders and was not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest, and that an\ninjunction was warranted. The district court \"enjoin[ed] CMS from\nany further use of race-based lotteries, preferences, and set-asides in\nstudent assignment.\" Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 57\nF. Supp. 2d 228, 292 (W.D.N.C. 1999). Citing interests in stability,\nthe district court concluded that the injunction would not affect stu-\ndent assignments for the 1999-2000 school year, but would apply to\nstudent assignments for the 2000-2001 school year. See id. at 292\nn.52. The district court awarded Capacchione nominal damages in\nrecognition of the constitutional violation and also awarded the\nplaintiff-intervenors attorney fees. CMS and the Swann plaintiffs filed\n  1\n   Those represented by Capacchione and Grant will be referred to as the\n\"plaintiff-intervenors.\"\n\f16      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nnotices of appeal, and CMS moved to stay the injunction, except as\napplied to the magnet schools, until the 2001-02 school year. The\nSwann plaintiffs moved for a complete stay pending appeal. On\nNovember 15, 1999, the district court denied the motions. CMS and\nthe Swann plaintiffs, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n8(a)(2), moved this court for a stay. On December 30, 1999, we\nstayed the district court’s injunction pending further order of this\ncourt.\n\n   After briefing and appellate arguments, a divided panel of this\ncourt vacated and remanded the district court’s unitary status determi-\nnation, holding that the district court’s findings were insufficient in\nthe areas of student assignment, facilities and resources, transporta-\ntion, and student achievement. As for CMS’s magnet schools admis-\nsions policy, the panel held that the policy was specifically permitted\nby prior court orders and that the policy did not violate the Constitu-\ntion. The panel also vacated the district court’s injunction, the award\nof nominal damages, and the award of attorney fees. See Belk v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 233 F.3d 232 (4th Cir. 2000).\nA majority of the active circuit judges thereafter voted to hear this\nappeal en banc.\n\n                          II. Unitary Status\n\n   The district court’s unitary status finding is reviewed for clear\nerror. See Riddick v. School Bd., 784 F.2d 521, 533 (4th Cir. 1986);\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). \"A finding is clearly erroneous when, although\nthere is evidence to support it, on the entire evidence the reviewing\ncourt is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\nbeen committed.\" Faulconer v. Commissioner, 748 F.2d 890, 895 (4th\nCir. 1984). In clarifying the clearly erroneous standard, the Supreme\nCourt has explained:\n\n     If the district court’s account of the evidence is plausible in\n     light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals\n     may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been\n     sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evi-\n     dence differently. Where there are two permissible views of\n     the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot\n     be clearly erroneous.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     17\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985). The\nSupreme Court also stressed that even when appellate review is based\nprimarily on documentary evidence, the clearly erroneous standard of\nreview remains the same. See id. at 574. So long as the district court’s\nunitary status determination rests on a permissible view of the evi-\ndence, it must be affirmed.\n\n   The Supreme Court has declined to define or provide a \"fixed\nmeaning\" for the term \"unitary.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 487\n(1992). However, in light of the aim of Brown I, which was \"the elim-\nination of state-mandated or deliberately maintained dual school sys-\ntems,\" Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 737 (1974) (Milliken I), a\nschool system must be declared unitary when it no longer discrimi-\nnates between children on the basis of race, see Green, 391 U.S. at\n442. The burden of proof falls on the party seeking an end to court\nsupervision. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494.\n\n    In undertaking a unitary status inquiry, a court must ask \"whether\nthe Board ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree\nsince it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination\nha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Board of Educ. v.\nDowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249-50 (1991). Implicit in the Supreme Court’s\nuse of the term \"practicable\" is \"a reasonable limit on the duration of\n. . . federal supervision.\" Coalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd.\nof Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 760 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Dowell, 498 U.S.\nat 247 (\"From the very first, federal supervision of local school sys-\ntems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimina-\ntion.\"). Hence, the goals of a desegregation order not only encompass\na remedy for the violation, but also prompt restoration of local con-\ntrol. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490 (\"Returning schools to the control\nof local authorities at the earliest practicable date is essential to\nrestore their true accountability in our governmental system. . . .\nWhere control lies, so too does responsibility.\"); Milliken I, 418 U.S.\nat 741-42 (\"No single tradition in public education is more deeply\nrooted than local control over the operation of schools; local auton-\nomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of com-\nmunity concern and support for public schools and to quality of the\neducational process.\").\n\n  Among the most important reference points in determining whether\na school board has fulfilled its duties so that local control may be\n\f18      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nresumed are the factors set out in Green: student assignment, faculty\nassignment, facilities and resources, transportation, staff assignment,\nand extracurricular activities. See Green, 391 U.S. at 435. In its dis-\ncretion, a court conducting a unitary status hearing may consider\nother relevant factors not mentioned in Green. See Freeman, 503 U.S.\nat 492. We address the district court’s consideration of each factor in\nturn, but only to determine whether \"the district court’s account of the\nevidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\"\nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 573-74.\n\n                       A. Student Assignment\n\n   Student assignment is perhaps the most critical Green factor\nbecause state-mandated separation of pupils on the basis of race is the\nessence of the dual system. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474 (observing\nthat the issue of student assignment is \"fundamental\" because \"under\nthe former de jure regimes racial exclusion was both the means and\nthe end of a policy motivated by disparagement of . . . the disfavored\nrace\"). To determine whether a school was racially balanced or imbal-\nanced, the district court adopted a plus/minus fifteen percent variance\nfrom the district-wide ratio of black to white students. See Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 246. However, the district court emphasized\n\"that there is no level of compliance with the standard that is determi-\nnative.\" Id. When schools are outside the variance, a \"reasonable and\nsupportable explanation[ ]\" will suffice. Id.\n\n   The district court did not err in adopting a plus/minus fifteen per-\ncent variance. Considering that the only variance ever approved by\nthe district court in the course of the Swann litigation was a \"‘plus\n15%’ from the district-wide average,\" id. at 245, the addition of a\nminus fifteen percent is reasonable. Moreover, the Supreme Court has\npermitted a \"limited use . . . of mathematical ratios\" by district courts,\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 25, and much higher variances have been used to\ndefine desegregation, see Manning v. Hillsborough County Sch. Bd.,\n244 F.3d 927, 935 (11th Cir. 2001) (using a plus/minus twenty per-\ncent variance); see generally, David J. Armor, Forced Justice: School\nDesegregation and the Law 160 (1995) (observing that in over sev-\nenty percent of the school districts with desegregation plans where\nracial balance is measured by numerical standards, a variance of\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      19\n                                                2\nplus/minus fifteen percent or greater is used). In sum, the plus/minus\nfifteen percent variance is clearly within accepted standards, and pro-\nvides a reasonable starting point in the unitary status determination.\n\n                    1. CMS’s Compliance Record\n\n   The district court began by observing that since 1970, of the 126\nschools in operation, \"only twenty schools (16%) have had black stu-\ndent bodies higher than 15% above the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years, and only seventeen schools (13%) have had black\nstudent bodies lower than 15% below the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 248 (footnote omit-\nted). In addition, the district court found that CMS has not operated\na single-race school since 1970. See id.\n\n  The district court also turned to two desegregation indices: the dis-\nsimilarity index and the index of interracial exposure. The former\n\"measures the degree of racial imbalance, and it is derived by com-\nparing the racial composition of each school to the districtwide com-\nposition,\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172, and the latter measures \"the average\npercent white in schools attended by black students, weighted by the\nproportion of black students in each school.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172.\nAccording to the report of the plaintiff-intervenors’ expert witness,\nDr. David J. Armor, a dissimilarity value of twenty or below signifies\n  2\n   At trial, Dr. Eric Smith, the current superintendent of CMS, testified\nthat unitary status depended on every school being in balance. See J.A.\nXV-7187 & 7239. This is not the law. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 24 (\"The\nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of\nthe school system as a whole.\").\n   We find equally erroneous the Swann plaintiffs’ assertion at appellate\nargument before the panel that \"[t]he issue of how many schools are bal-\nanced has never been a question in this case.\" App. Tr. 91. The racial\ncomposition of schools goes to the heart of a desegregation case, and is\nvery much key to a review of the district court’s declaration of unitary\nstatus. See Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (ordering CMS to assign pupils\n\"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various\ngrade levels have about the same proportion of black and white stu-\ndents\").\n\f20     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\n\"a highly balanced school system\" and a score under thirty signifies\n\"a substantially desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172. CMS’s\ndissimilarity score was sixteen in 1980 and twenty-six in 1995. From\nthis it is clear that CMS quickly desegregated in the 1970s and contin-\nues to maintain a \"substantially desegregated system.\" The dissimilar-\nity index also indicates that CMS has better racial balance than\nseveral comparable districts did when they were declared unitary. See\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,173.\n   The index of interracial exposure, like the dissimilarity index,\nshows that CMS has made great leaps of progress. A score of zero on\nthe exposure index signifies total segregation, while a score of fifty\nor above indicates a \"highly desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,172. Schools in CMS typically score above fifty, whereas before\nthe desegregation order the schools’ scores hovered near twenty or\nbelow. See J.A. XXXIII-16,194-96.\n   CMS and the Swann plaintiffs correctly point out that the data sug-\ngest that in recent years racial imbalance has increased in some\nschools. Aware of this trend, the district court made a number of find-\nings on growth and demographic change in the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg area. The most revealing findings are as follows:\n     • the county population has increased from 354,656 in\n       1970 to 613,310 in 1997\n     • in 1970 the school district was the forty-third largest in\n       the nation and is today the twenty-third largest\n     • among cities with more than 500,000 people, Charlotte\n       ranks second in population growth in the 1990s\n     • the racial composition of the county has changed from\n       seventy-six percent white and twenty-four percent black\n       in 1970 to sixty-eight percent white, twenty-seven per-\n       cent black, and five percent other in 1997\n     • the current racial composition of schoolchildren is fifty\n       percent white, forty-two percent black, and eight percent\n       other\n     • as the county has become more suburban the inner city\n       and nearby suburbs have lost large numbers of white res-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      21\n        idents as they spread farther out into the formerly rural\n        sections of the county\n     • some middle suburban communities that were once all\n       white are now predominately black\n     • the rural black population in the southern part of the\n       county has remained relatively constant while the white\n       population has tripled because of suburbanization\nSee Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 236-39. These findings are sup-\nported by the report of the plaintiff-intervenors’ expert in demograph-\nics, Dr. William Clark. See J.A. XXXIII-16230-306. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court concluded that \"[t]here can be no doubt that demography\nand geography have played the largest role in causing imbalance.\"\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250.\n   Testimony from Dr. John Murphy, CMS’s superintendent from\n1991 to 1995, corroborates the district court’s conclusion. Dr. Murphy\ntestified that when he assumed his duties he \"was quite concerned\nabout the increasing difficulty in bringing about racial balance . . .\nbecause of the demographic shifts that were occurring.\" J.A. VI-2712.\nPopulation growth translated into more automobiles on the road, mak-\ning increased busing impracticable because \"the travel time to move\nyoungsters from the suburbs into the city with the flow of rush hour\ntraffic was a problem.\" J.A. VI-2732. In the fall of 1991, CMS hired\nDr. Michael J. Stolee to examine the problem and offer solutions. Dr.\nStolee also concluded that CMS’s task \"has been complicated by pop-\nulation growth,\" J.A. XXXII-15,571, and he recommended the adop-\ntion of a magnet schools program, which CMS promptly\nimplemented.\n   The Supreme Court has dealt with similar population growth and\nshifting demographics in the context of unitary status. In Freeman,\nthe court unequivocally stated that \"racial imbalance . . . [is] not tanta-\nmount to a showing that the school district [is] in noncompliance with\nthe decree or with its duties under the law.\" 503 U.S. at 494. Brown\nI, of course, does not mandate that racial balance be pursued in perpe-\ntuity. Once the original racial imbalance caused by a constitutional\nviolation has been rectified, \"the school district is under no duty to\nremedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.\" Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 494.\n\f22      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\n   The Swann plaintiffs contend that consideration of demographics\nand the rationale of Freeman are misplaced because the growth and\nshifting demographics of DeKalb County, Georgia, the school district\nunder court order in Freeman, exceeded that of Charlotte-\nMecklenburg. While CMS’s growth rates and demographic shifts cer-\ntainly do not equal those experienced in DeKalb,3 we can find nothing\nin Freeman limiting its holding to the specific facts of DeKalb\nCounty or establishing DeKalb as the standard for measuring imbal-\nance caused by demographic factors. On the contrary, the opinion\nspeaks in general terms. The Supreme Court observed that in the\nUnited States \"it is inevitable that the demographic makeup of school\ndistricts, based as they are on political subdivisions such as counties\nand municipalities, may undergo rapid change.\" Id. at 495. Mobility,\nthe Court noted, \"is a distinct characteristic of our society.\" Id. at 494.\n   Similarly, the Swann plaintiffs contend that unlike DeKalb County,\nMecklenburg County has become more integrated as the black popu-\nlation has increased. This is simply not true. For example, a report\nprepared in 1992 by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Staff for\nChairman Arthur Griffin concluded that \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg con-\ntinues to be a city of segregated neighborhoods\" with \"[c]oncentra-\ntions of Black households . . . generally located in the central city.\"\nJ.A. XXI-10,485; see also J.A. XXVIII-13,803 (1992 student assign-\nment plan stating that \"housing across the county is not racially inte-\ngrated. Approximately 50% of all black students live within one\ndistrict, while only 10% of white students reside in that district.\");\nJ.A. XXII-10,575 (CMS report chronicling growth of the black popu-\nlation and decline of the white population in the inner city). Clearly,\nincreased housing integration is not necessarily a corollary of\nAfrican-American population growth. Hence, despite the Swann\nplaintiffs’ best efforts, Freeman cannot be distinguished into nothing-\nness, nor does the standard of review permit this court to reweigh the\nevidence of the changes in CMS.\n   We also note that when confronted with growing imbalance in cer-\ntain schools, the district court demanded cogent and supportable\n  3\n    For example, the population of DeKalb County grew from 70,000 in\n1950 to 450,000 in 1985, and the percentage of black students in the dis-\ntrict grew from 5.6 percent in 1969 to forty-seven percent in 1986. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 475.\n\f         BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION       23\nexplanations from the plaintiff-intervenors, paying special attention to\nthe former de jure schools still in use. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp.\n2d at 246. Evidence presented at trial indicated that \"[o]f the 16 for-\nmer black schools that are still open, 13 are currently balanced and\nhave been desegregated for periods ranging from 22 to 28 years. Of\nthe 3 that currently exceed the +15% black variance, each has been\nbalanced for at least 22 years.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Interestingly, of\nthe seventy-two former white schools that are still open, fifteen are\nnow majority black and were in balance for periods of twelve to\ntwenty-five years. See J.A. XXXIII-16,176.\n\n   In addition, Dr. Armor examined the seventeen schools in CMS\nthat exceeded the plus fifteen percent variance for three or more years\nduring the last decade. See J.A. XXXIII-16,174-76.4 Sixteen of the\nseventeen were balanced for periods ranging from nineteen to twenty-\nsix years, with one school experiencing balance for sixteen years. To\nthe extent that CMS’s pupil reassignments could be assessed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that changes instituted by CMS were \"attempts to\nmaintain or restore racial balance in the face of overwhelming demo-\ngraphic growth and mobility.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Indeed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that imbalance had been reduced in several of the\nschools because CMS’s magnet program attracted white students\nfrom the outer reaches of the county.\n\n  4\n   Dr. Armor did not include the predominantly white schools in this\nanalysis on three grounds:\n      (1) the court order did not establish a minimum percent black\n      enrollment, (2) the half-dozen schools that have had low black\n      enrollment for the past three or more years and that were operat-\n      ing in 1972 have been racially balanced for at least ten years[,]\n      and (3) the demographic analysis of Dr. Clark shows that these\n      schools have become imbalanced or were opened imbalanced\n      because of the substantial white enrollment growth in the out-\n      skirts of the county.\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,174 (footnote omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 26\n(observing \"that the existence of some small number of one-race, or vir-\ntually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark\nof a system that still practices segregation by law\").\n\f24      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   Long periods of almost perfect compliance with the court’s racial\nbalance guidelines,5 coupled with some imbalance in the wake of\nmassive demographic shifts, strongly supports the district court’s\nfinding that the present levels of imbalance are in no way connected\nwith the de jure segregation once practiced in CMS. See Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 495 (\"Where resegregation is a product not of state action\nbut of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications.\");\nManning, 244 F.3d at 944 (\"Where a [party seeking a finding of uni-\ntary status] shows that demographic shifts are a substantial cause of\nthe racial imbalances, [the party] has overcome the presumption of de\njure segregation.\"); United States v. Meriwether County, 171 F.3d\n1333, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999) (observing that a \"school district need not\nwage a battle against demographics to achieve perfect racial bal-\nance\"). The evidence presented at trial adequately explained why a\nfew schools have become imbalanced, and we can discern no evi-\ndence or omissions that indicate clear error has been committed in\nthis regard.\n\n                    2. Martin and Unitary Status\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs also point to school sitings, transportation\nburdens, and school transfers as evidence that the growing imbalance\nis caused by state action rather than private choices, and that CMS has\nnot complied with the district court’s orders in good faith. In advanc-\ning their argument, the Swann plaintiffs rely chiefly on Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 475 F. Supp. 1318\n(W.D.N.C. 1979), in which a group of parents sought to enjoin CMS\nfrom reassigning over 4000 students in order to maintain racial bal-\nance in certain schools. The plaintiffs in Martin based their position\non Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424\n(1976), and Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S.\n265 (1978). In the former case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that\ndistrict courts could not order a school district \"to rearrange its atten-\ndance zones each year so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by\nthe court was maintained in perpetuity,\" Spangler, 427 U.S. at 436,\n  5\n   Even the Swann plaintiffs admit that ten years after the district court\ncharged the board with taking affirmative steps to desegregate schools,\nthe system \"w[as] nearly 100% statistically compliant with the court’s\norders.\" Plaintiff-Appellants’ Brief at 38.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      25\nand in the latter the Court struck down a medical school admissions\npolicy that reserved sixteen of one hundred seats in the entering class\nfor applicants who were \"‘economically and/or educationally disad-\nvantaged’\" and who were members of certain minority groups, Bakke,\n438 U.S. at 274. The district court in Martin distinguished Spangler\nby observing that it was but a restatement of the Swann Court’s admo-\nnition about the use of racial quotas and that, unlike Pasadena City,\nCMS had not achieved racially neutral attendance patterns. See Mar-\ntin, 475 F. Supp. at 1340. As for the Bakke decision, the district court\npointed out that no student in CMS was denied \"an equal educational\nopportunity\" and that the admissions policy in Bakke was imple-\nmented \"against a backdrop devoid of specific judicial findings or\nadministrative acknowledgments of the prior segregated status of the\nschool system.\" Id. at 1345. Accordingly, the Martin court concluded\nthat CMS’s reassignment of students was \"within constitutional limits\nand should be upheld.\" Id. at 1321. The district court took pains to\nensure that its opinion would not be interpreted too broadly: \"This\norder simply upholds the actions of the 1978 Board against the attacks\nby the plaintiffs.\" Id. at 1347. In the course of the Martin opinion, the\ndistrict court observed that CMS had fallen short in four areas: con-\nstruction and location of facilities in parts of the county likely to\nenhance desegregation, placement of elementary and kindergarten\ngrades in schools throughout the county, monitoring of student trans-\nfers so as to prevent resegregation, and allocation of the burdens of\nbusing. See id. at 1328-29. However, the district court also noted that\nCMS had made great progress and that a return to the old system of\nsegregation \"has not tempted the present School Board, who are\nstanding fast in their endeavor to run the schools according to law\nwhile providing quality education.\" Id. at 1347.\n\n   In Capacchione, the district court correctly observed that \"Martin\nwas not a unitary status hearing,\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250,\nand that because \"the desegregation plan was still in its fledgling\nstages, the Court was inclined to keep the pressure on CMS,\" id. at\n251. The Capacchione court further observed that post-Martin\nchanges in Charlotte-Mecklenburg counseled looking at the \"concerns\n[of Martin] in a new light.\" Id. The district court’s interpretation of\nMartin is reasonable and in accord with the rule in this circuit that a\ndistrict court, as a continuous institution, is \"best able to interpret its\nown orders.\" Vaughns v. Board of Educ., 758 F.2d 983, 989 (4th Cir.\n\f26      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n1985) (school desegregation case). Moreover, the Martin order was\nissued thirteen years before the Supreme Court made clear in Free-\nman that the affirmative measures mandated by Green are not meant\nto remedy \"private choices\" that lead to resegregation. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 495. The state of the law and the understanding of duties upon\nschool districts were far different when Martin was handed down.\nHence, a number of assertions in Martin cannot be squared with the\npresent state of the law. See, e.g., Martin 475 F. Supp. at 1346 (stating\nthat segregated housing patterns must necessarily lead to the unconsti-\ntutional segregation of schools). Ignoring the changes in Charlotte-\nMecklenburg and in the law by erecting Martin as the framework for\nunitary status, as the Swann plaintiffs urged below, would defy com-\nmon sense and run afoul of developments in the Supreme Court’s\nschool desegregation jurisprudence. See United States Gypsum Co. v.\nSchiavo Bros., 668 F.2d 172, 176 (3d Cir. 1981) (concluding that a\nsuccessor judge \"is empowered to reconsider [the legal conclusions of\nan unavailable predecessor] to the same extent that his or her pre-\ndecessor could have\"); see also Meriwether County, 171 F.3d at 1339\n(\"The law does not make a school district a prisoner based on factors,\nsuch as demographic tendencies, that are beyond its control.\"). We\nwill examine the district court’s Martin findings in turn.\n\n                           a. School Siting\n\n   The district court found that CMS had not shirked its duties under\nthe law with regard to school sitings. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp.\n2d at 251-53. The record reveals that CMS has, to the extent practica-\nble, continually endeavored to site schools in order to foster integra-\ntion, and has adopted a policy of building schools in areas equally\naccessible to blacks and whites. Testimony of current board members\nindicated that in efforts to fulfill this policy, CMS has purchased\nproperty in low growth areas for school construction even though\nschools in predominantly white high growth areas were overcrowded.\nSee J.A. V-1986-87. In 1992 CMS reaffirmed its siting policy and\nresolved that, \"whenever possible,\" new schools would be built in\nareas that would \"provide black student enrollment of not less than 10\npercent from the census tracts serving the new school.\" J.A. XXXII-\n15,686. The impetus behind the resolution was growth in the periph-\nery of the county which the board speculated would continue patterns\nof housing segregation, thus making it more difficult to maintain\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      27\nracial balance in the schools. Evidence presented at trial indicated that\nthe ten percent rule was destined for failure because it was not possi-\nble to implement the rule and still \"meet the 60-minute bus ride\nlimit.\" J.A. XXII-10,869. Nevertheless, extensive evidence was pre-\nsented showing that CMS never sited schools in order to foster segre-\ngation and that \"every effort was made to try to find school sites that\nwould bring people together in balanced numbers.\" J.A. VI-2752; see\nMeriwether County, 171 F.3d at 1337 (stating that \"the absence of\nevidence indicating that racial motives played any part in the Board’s\ndecisionmaking process\" is relevant in accessing compliance with\ndesegregation orders). For example, CMS’s executive director of\nplanning and student placement testified that in siting schools CMS\n\"looked at both African-American and all populations not only in the\nvicinity of the site, but in the entire district.\" J.A. VII-2920. So dedi-\ncated was CMS to siting schools in integrated areas that it contem-\nplated refusing a gift of land for school use because the land was in\na predominantly white area. See J.A. V-1985.\n\n   Faced with growth in the predominantly white regions of the far\nsouth and north, see J.A. XXXIII-16,261, CMS was compelled to\nserve populations in those areas via school sitings. CMS’s data show\nthat in the late 1990s, student population was \"growing at nearly\n4,000 students per year,\" J.A. XXIX-14,133, and consequently the\nboard was \"just trying to keep up\" with the population explosion in\nbuilding schools, J.A. V-2249. Overcrowding was a problem, and in\nthe late 1990s \"the average high school expected to operate at 109\npercent of its capacity.\" J.A. XXIX-14,133. Even though CMS was\nforced to build schools at a rapid rate to serve an expanding student\npopulation, pupil assignment plans in which CMS described popula-\ntion growth as a \"major consideration[ ]\" are replete with efforts to\nimprove racial balance. J.A. XXIX-14,133. For example, the 1997-98\nassignment plan highlighted the creation and expansion of several\nmagnet programs specially designed to reduce the black ratio in a\nnumber of schools. See J.A. XXIX-14,147-51. To the extent practica-\nble, CMS did not sacrifice racial balance concerns to population\ngrowth. Though the two often pulled CMS in different directions, the\nrecord indicates that the board coordinated racial balance and school\nsitings as best it could under the circumstances. The evidence does\nnot indicate that the abandonment of the ten percent rule or other\n\f28      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\ndecisions regarding school siting were the result of a desire to perpet-\nuate the dual school system or circumvent the district court’s orders.\n\n   CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, citing to prior orders, counter that\nthe board has not done all that it could do in the area of school siting.\nErection of such a standard, however, would effectively replace prac-\nticability with possibility. See Manning, 244 F.3d at 945 (observing\nthat \"the law does not require a defendant school board to take every\nconceivable step in attempting to desegregate\"). The former implies\nmeasures that can be reasonably implemented under the circum-\nstances, while the latter omits the reasonableness requirement. For\ninstance, it was possible for CMS to adhere to the ten percent rule\nwhile ignoring growth in the far north and south of the county.\nYoungsters would have been compelled to ride buses for long periods\nwhile traveling with the flow of rush hour traffic, but it was nonethe-\nless possible to adhere to the ten percent rule. Of course, the practica-\nbility of a refusal to respond to growth in Charlotte-Mecklenburg is\nanother matter.\n\n   In the same vein, the Swann plaintiffs contend that school siting\ndecisions were a response to white flight, which is an impermissible\nreason for failing to comply with a desegregation order. Growth, of\ncourse, is far different from flight. And experts offered evidence of\n\"the economic boom in the Charlotte Metropolitan area in the last\ndecade.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,233. Charlotte-Mecklenburg is one of the\nmost dynamic areas in the South; it is far different from the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg of Swann, and much changed from that of Martin. In\nlight of the growth in the county and a plethora of evidence demon-\nstrating that the board used its best efforts to site schools in order to\nfoster integration, the district court did not commit error when it con-\ncluded that there is no \"continuing constitutional violation[ ] in the\narea of school siting.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253.\n\n                        b. Burdens of Busing\n\n   As for the burdens of busing, the district court found that in the\nmost recent school year, 15,533 black students and 11,184 non-black\nstudents were bused for balancing purposes. Id. As stated earlier, traf-\nfic patterns make busing suburban students into the inner city far\nmore difficult than busing inner-city children into the suburbs. See\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     29\nJ.A. VI-2732; J.A. V-2228. Though a disproportionate number of\nAfrican-American students are bused, the growth, housing patterns,\nand traffic patterns support the district court’s conclusion that the\nrealities of the current situation should not block a unitary status\ndetermination. See Meriwether County, 171 F.3d at 1341 (finding no\nconstitutional violation when white students are \"somewhat less bur-\ndened by the transportation scheme\" because of demographic factors).\n\n                        c. Student Transfers\n\n   Finally, Martin’s concern with student transfers appears to have\nbeen based on the assumption that CMS would experience average\ngrowth. Courts are not omniscient, and the district court in 1979 could\nnot have foreseen the changing demographics that would make stu-\ndent transfers the least of CMS’s worries. In the present litigation, the\ndistrict court observed \"that CMS ‘kept an eye on [magnet transfers]\nso that there wouldn’t be a run on the bank so to speak from any one\nschool.’\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250 n.10 (alteration in origi-\nnal). This finding is not clearly erroneous, nor can we discern the\nneed for more findings on this issue in light of post-Martin changes.\n\n                            3. Conclusion\n\n   In sum, the district court’s findings on student assignment are\n\"plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\" Anderson, 470\nU.S. at 573. The dual system of student assignment in CMS has been\neradicated \"to the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250. The\nimbalance existing in some schools is not traceable to the former dual\nsystem or to renewed discriminatory actions, but rather is a result of\ngrowth and shifting demographics. Consequently, we hold that the\ndistrict court’s findings on student assignment are not clearly errone-\nous.\n\n                       B. Faculty Assignment\n\n   In examining faculty assignment, the district court again used a\nplus/minus fifteen percent variance. Of the 126 schools operating in\nCMS, the district court found that in 1997-98 only ten schools were\nout of balance. The Swann plaintiffs point out that this number grew\n\f30      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nto sixteen in 1998-99, but this means that a mere twelve percent of\nthe schools were out of balance. This is a far cry from the dual system\nin which \"most of the 24,000 [black students] ha[d] no white teach-\ners.\" Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360. There is simply no evidence that\nCMS assigns black teachers to predominantly black schools and white\nteachers to predominantly white schools. Thus, the district court’s\nconclusion that this Green factor has been satisfied is not clearly erro-\nneous.\n\n                     C. Facilities and Resources\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs and CMS contend that the district court\nimpermissibly shifted the burden of proof on this factor. As a result\nof the alleged error of law, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that\nthis issue must be remanded to the district court.\n\n   This court has previously made clear that \"once a court has found\nan unlawful dual school system, [those alleging the existence of racial\ndisparities] are entitled to the presumption that current disparities are\ncausally related to prior segregation, and the burden of proving other-\nwise rests on the defendants.\" School Bd. of the City of Richmond v.\nBaliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). In this case, however,\nthe district court noted that none of the prior orders entered in the\nlong history of the Swann litigation had ever found racial disparities\nto exist with regard to school facilities and concluded that CMS and\nthe Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing discrimination\nwith regard to facilities. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 263 (\"[I]t\nwould defy logic to place now the burden of proof on the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors, requiring them to prove that vestiges of discrimination in\nfacilities have been remedied, when the Court originally found no\nvestiges to exist.\"). In our view, this erroneous assignment of the bur-\nden of proof, which did not affect the manner in which the parties\ntried the case or otherwise prejudice their rights, is harmless and does\nnot undermine the district court’s factual conclusions regarding the\nfacilities factor.6\n  6\n   Given the counter-intuitive alignment of the parties in this case, it\ncould be argued that the presumption and burden allocation set forth in\nBaliles should not be applied, and that CMS should instead be required\nto prove the existence of racial disparity in its facilities. See United\nStates v. City of Yonkers, 181 F.3d 301, 309-11 (2d Cir. 1999), vacated\non reh’g, 197 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      31\n   Immediately after assigning the burden to CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs, the district court’s order nonetheless summarized and\nweighed the facilities evidence presented by the parties. The district\ncourt carefully analyzed the testimony and report of Dr. Dwayne\nGardner, an expert witness for CMS. Dr. Gardner analyzed seventy-\nthree schools—every identifiably black school in CMS and a sam-\npling of balanced schools and predominantly white schools. Dr. Gard-\nner measured the adequacy, safety, healthfulness, accessibility,\nflexibility, efficiency, expansibility, and appearance of the schools.\nBased on the inspection he grouped schools as follows: \"0-44 (sug-\ngests replacement), 45-59 (needs major improvement), 60-74 (needs\nminor improvement), 75-89 (serves program needs), and 90-100\n(exceptional quality).\" Id. at 264. The survey revealed that of the four\nschools that warranted replacement, two were majority white, and two\nwere imbalanced black. See J.A. XXV-12,182-86. Thirty-four schools\nfell into the \"needs major improvement\" category, of which sixteen\nwere imbalanced black and eighteen identifiably white.\n\n   The district court determined that Dr. Gardner’s testimony estab-\nlished that any current disparities were functions of the age of the\nfacilities at issue, because\n\n    different building standards apply when a new facility is\n    constructed as compared to when an older facility is reno-\n    vated or upgraded. In other words, the renovation of an\n    older facility usually complies with the code under which\n    the facility was built. Because most facilities in the predomi-\n    nately black inner city are older while facilities in the pre-\n    dominately white suburbs are newer, the inference is that\n    differences in building standards tend to affect black stu-\n    dents disproportionately. This does not amount to racial dis-\n    crimination. Indeed, this practice applies regardless of the\n    racial composition of the school. Thus, older schools that\n    are predominately white—several of which were built in the\n    1920s—are likewise affected by this practice.\n\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (footnote and transcript refer-\nences omitted). Thus, the district court concluded from Dr. Gardner’s\ntestimony and report \"that CMS’s facilities needs are spread across\nthe system without regard to the racial composition of its schools.\" Id.\n\f32       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\n   The district court also considered the testimony of CMS’s assistant\nsuperintendent of building services, who testified that out of 108\nschools in need of renovations, eighty-one percent were racially bal-\nanced or identifiably white. See J.A. VIII-3810 & 3818. The district\ncourt concluded that this witness’s testimony likewise demonstrated\nthat the deficiencies in CMS’s facilities were unrelated to the former\nde jure system.\n   Finally, the court considered CMS’s track record in renovating old\nfacilities, praising its practice of allocating funds on a per-pupil basis\nand noting that \"CMS has spent a large portion of [its] bond money\non improving schools in predominantly black areas.\" Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 266.\n   After an extensive discussion of this evidence, the court made the\nfollowing finding of fact with regard to facilities:\n      Just as Judge McMillan found thirty years ago, the Court\n      finds today that inequities in facilities exist throughout the\n      system regardless of the racial makeup of the school. These\n      disparities are generally the result of the relative ages of the\n      facilities, combined with an ongoing lack of funding and the\n      need to accommodate unprecedented growth.\nId.\n   This finding is clearly determinative of the question of unitary sta-\ntus as to facilities, regardless of which party carried the burden of\nproof. That is, the district court, after carefully considering and\nweighing all the evidence presented on this factor, concluded that any\ndisparity as to the condition of the facilities that might exist was not\ncaused by any intentional discrimination by CMS, but instead was a\nfunction of the age and location of the facilities and the ever-present\nproblem of allocating all too scarce funds. Even if the district court\nhad assigned the burden of proof to the plaintiff-intervenors, this fac-\ntual finding would have compelled a ruling in their favor. In fact, the\ndistrict court acknowledged as much, stating \"that the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors have proven, to the extent possible, the absence of intent\nand causation.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267 n.38.7\n\n\n  7\n   From this footnote and the district court’s detailed discussion about\nthe cause of any disparity in CMS’s facilities, it appears that the district\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      33\n   Therefore, because the district court’s findings, which were based\non the court’s weighing of all of the relevant evidence presented at\ntrial, would have yielded the same conclusion under a proper assign-\nment of the burden of proof, any error with regard to the burden of\nproof is harmless. See Washington State Dep’t of Transp. v. Washing-\nton Natural Gas Co., 59 F.3d 793, 801 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding dis-\ntrict court’s improper assignment of the burden of proof to be\nharmless because review of the entire record established \"that under\nthe proper assignment of the burden of proof, the district court would\nhave reached the same decision\"); Applewood Landscape & Nursery\nCo. v. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1506 (1st Cir. 1989) (conclud-\ning that, if the district court improperly allocated burden of proof on\na particular issue, the error was harmless because the district court’s\ndecision on that issue turned on the weight of the evidence in the\nrecord and not on burden of proof rules); cf. Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 992\n(recognizing that an error in shifting the burden of proof in a school\ndesegregation case may be harmless if the record is such that the court\ncan conclude that substantial rights have not been prejudiced).\n\n   Because any error associated with the burden of proof is harmless,\nthe only question that remains is whether the district court’s factual\nfindings about the facilities are clearly erroneous. Though the evi-\ndence could have been weighed differently on this factor, \"[w]here\nthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s\nchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson, 470\nU.S. at 574. In 1969, the district court found that there was no consti-\ntutional violation in the \"quality of school buildings and facilities.\"\nSwann, 300 F. Supp. at 1372. The Capacchione court found that this\nremains true today, and the evidence as a whole indicates that this\nfinding is not clearly erroneous.\n\ncourt really made alternative rulings on the facilities question: The court\nfirst concluded that CMS and the Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of\nproof with regard to facilities and that they failed to carry that burden.\nSee Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267 (\"[T]he Swann Plaintiffs have\nfailed to overcome the Court’s previous findings on facilities by estab-\nlishing the requisite discriminatory intent and causation.\"). The court\nthen ruled in the alternative, as indicated by the footnote and the find-\nings, that the plaintiff-intervenors proved that any disparities were the\nresult of factors unrelated to state action.\n\f34     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                         D. Transportation\n\n   During the 1998 school year, five out of every six students in CMS\nrode a school bus. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267. The par-\nties do not dispute the district court’s finding that \"CMS provides free\nbus transportation to all students who do not live within a mile and\na half of their schools.\" Id. The focus of the Swann plaintiffs’ argu-\nment on this factor deals with the Martin opinion. As previously dis-\ncussed, Martin does not provide the framework for a unitary status\ndetermination and the district court’s interpretation of Martin, along\nwith the finding that the present state of busing \"may be about the\nbest CMS can do,\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253, does not con-\nstitute error.\n\n                        E. Staff Assignment\n\n   The district court, noting that findings of discrimination in school\nstaffing were never made, concluded that CMS has complied with its\nconstitutional duties. The parties point this court to no contrary evi-\ndence, nor have we discovered such in the record. Therefore, we hold\nthat the district court’s findings regarding the fifth Green factor are\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\n                    F. Extracurricular Activities\n\n   The district court concluded that there was no discrimination or\nvestiges of discrimination with regard to extracurricular activities.\nThe evidence presented at trial showed that the ratios of blacks and\nwhites participating in extracurricular activities, though varying\nsomewhat from year to year, is approximately equal. See J.A. XXIV-\n11,634. Areas where there are disparities were not shown to be linked\nto the former dual system. For example, blacks often outnumber\nwhites in holding elective offices in student government, but whites\nhave a higher level of representation in honors programs. No evidence\nis found in the record to indicate that CMS somehow pushes African-\nAmericans toward student government and away from honors pro-\ngrams. Consequently, the district court’s conclusion that CMS has\nsatisfied this Green factor is not clearly erroneous.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     35\n                        G. Ancillary Factors\n\n                         1. Teacher Quality\n\n   The district court found that there was no discrimination in the\nquality of teaching. The Swann plaintiffs contend that this finding is\nclearly erroneous because students in imbalanced African-American\nschools are more likely to have inexperienced teachers. This \"experi-\nence gap,\" to the extent it exists, is minuscule. The district court\nfound that \"teachers in imbalanced-black schools had 0.7 to 1.3 fewer\nyears experience than the district averages and had 1.6 to 2.9 fewer\nyears experience than teachers in imbalanced-white schools.\" Capa-\ncchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 271. To use middle school teachers as an\nexample, the statistics reveal that the average middle school teacher\nin an imbalanced African-American school had 8.2 years experience\nversus 9.8 years for his counterpart in an imbalanced white school. Id.\nThese numbers clearly support a finding of equality rather than dis-\nparity, and cannot undermine the district court’s conclusion on this\nfactor.\n\n   The district court also pointed to evidence indicating that experi-\nence does not necessarily relate to competency. For example, accord-\ning to former Superintendent Murphy, it is not uncommon to have\n\"excellent first-year teachers\" and \"very weak 35th-year teachers.\"\nJ.A. VI-2795. Other witnesses observed that the newer teachers had\nbetter \"knowledge of various teaching strategies\" and were more com-\nfortable with diverse classrooms. J.A. VII-3275.\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs also assert that imbalanced African-American\nschools have fewer teachers with advanced degrees. For instance, in\nimbalanced black high schools only thirty-one percent of the teachers\nheld advanced degrees, while forty-six percent of the teachers in\nimbalanced white high schools held advanced degrees. See Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 271. As it was with teacher experience, testi-\nmony was offered establishing that the number of degrees a teacher\npossesses does not necessarily translate into competence or quality\ninstruction. See J.A. VII-3276. According to former Superintendent\nMurphy, \"the degree level was not a significant indicator of getting\nbetter performance on the part of the teacher.\" J.A. VI-2795. Expert\nreports submitted by the plaintiff-intervenors also indicated that there\n\f36      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nis \"no significant relationship\" between black achievement and\nteacher education levels. J.A. XXXIII-16,221. In sum, the district\ncourt’s conclusion that African-American students receive equal\naccess to quality teachers is not clearly erroneous.\n\n                      2. Student Achievement\n\n   The district court found that the existence of an achievement gap\nbetween black and white students was not a vestige of the dual system\nor evidence of discrimination in the current operation of CMS. This\nwas an area of immense disagreement at trial, and the parties pre-\nsented a mountain of data on this subject. Though the Fourteenth\nAmendment guarantees equal protection but not equal outcomes, if\nlow African-American achievement is a result of the former de jure\nsystem, it must be eliminated to the extent practicable. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 249-50. Conversely, to the extent that low achievement\nis linked to other factors, it is beyond the reach of the court’s author-\nity. Most courts of appeals confronting this issue, including this court,\nhave declined to consider the achievement gap as a vestige of dis-\ncrimination or as evidence of current discrimination. See Baliles, 829\nF.2d at 1313 (upholding lower court’s findings that low achievement\nis \"primarily attributable to the high incidence of poverty\" in the\nschool district); see also United States v. City of Yonkers, 197 F.3d\n41, 54 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that \"using achievement test scores\nas a measure, either direct or indirect, of a school system’s movement\naway from segregation is deeply problematic\"), cert. denied, 120\nS. Ct. 2005 (2000); People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111\nF.3d 528, 537 (7th Cir. 1997) (explaining that a number of variables,\nother than discrimination, account for the achievement gap); Coali-\ntion to Save Our Children, 90 F.3d at 778 (finding \"a causal link\nbetween . . . socioeconomic factors and student achievement\").\n\n   The plaintiff-intervenors’ expert witness, Dr. Armor, presented evi-\ndence indicating that there is no correlation between African-\nAmerican performance and the racial balance of schools. See J.A.\nXXXIII-16,178. For example, Dr. Armor’s studies showed that\nAfrican-American students in the third through fifth grades attending\nschools sixteen to twenty-five percent African-American scored the\nsame on standardized tests as their counterparts in schools seventy-\nfive percent black or greater. See J.A. at 16,214. Similarly, African-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION      37\nAmerican students in the sixth through eighth grades attending\nschools sixteen percent black or less scored the same on standardized\ntests as their counterparts in schools seventy-five percent black or\ngreater. See J.A. XXXIII-16,215.\n   In order to shed light on the true causes of the achievement gap,\nDr. Armor turned to socioeconomic factors. The data revealed star-\ntling differences between black and white children in CMS.\n      Average black family income is $31,000 compared to\n      $59,000 for whites, and only 15 [percent] of black parents\n      are college graduates, compared to 58 percent for white par-\n      ents. A huge poverty gap is also revealed, with 63 percent\n      of black students on free lunch compared to only 9 percent\n      of white students. Finally, 83 percent of white students have\n      both parents at home, compared to only 42 percent for black\n      students.\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,179. According to Dr. Armor, the socioeconomic fac-\ntors plus the second grade scores, which are the earliest available,\nexplain \"nearly 80 percent of the reading gap and over 70 percent of\nthe math gap.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,180. Former Superintendent Murphy\ntestified that in his experience \"[p]oor students come behind and stay\nthat way. And in Charlotte, a majority of poor students happen to be\nAfrican-American.\" J.A. VI-2696. Dan Saltrick, former assistant\nsuperintendent for instructional services, also testified that in his\nexperience low student test scores related to parental support which\nin turn was \"a matter of . . . socioeconomic levels.\" J.A. VII-3280.\nWhile socioeconomic disparities between black and white pupils are\ntroubling, they are not the result of CMS’s actions or inactions and\ntherefore are beyond the scope of the original desegregation order.\nSee Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1314 (\"Educational deficiencies that result\nfrom problems such as poverty are best remedied by programs\ndirected toward eliminating poverty, not by indirect solutions through\nschool programs.\").8 Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err\n  8\n   Despite evidence that the achievement gap results from factors out-\nside CMS’s control, the district court found that CMS has undertaken\nsundry measures to eliminate the gap. For example, CMS adopted finan-\ncial incentives for teachers and principals tied to student performance,\nurged black students to take advanced placement and other higher level\n\f38      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nin finding that the achievement gap between black and white students\nis not a vestige of past discrimination or evidence of present discrimi-\nnation.\n                        3. Student Discipline\n   The district court found \"that any disparities that exist in the area\nof discipline are not causally related to the dual system.\" Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 281. In none of the court’s prior orders is there\nany indication that CMS has ever discriminated in meting out punish-\nment for disruptive students. However, recent statistics show that of\nthe 13,206 students disciplined from 1996-98, sixty-six percent were\nAfrican-American. See J.A. XXIV-11,637. As the district court noted,\n\"disparity does not, by itself, constitute discrimination.\" Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 281. The idea that CMS should have a disciplinary\nquota is patently absurd, and there is no evidence in the record that\nCMS targets African-American students for discipline. Instead, the\nevidence indicates that CMS has adopted guidelines whereby students\nreceive the same level of punishment for certain offenses to ensure\nthat the amount of punishment will not vary from school to school.\nA student charged with a disciplinary infraction may also appeal the\ncharge \"and may assert that the charge was due to racial bias.\" Id.\nThere is simply no evidence in the record that CMS treats African-\nAmerican students differently in disciplinary matters. Hence, the dis-\ntrict court’s conclusion that the disciplinary disparities are unrelated\nto the former de jure system is not clearly erroneous.\n                            H. Good Faith\n   Lastly, the district court found that CMS has complied with the\ndesegregation decree in good faith. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491\n(requiring school board \"to demonstrate its good-faith commitment to\na constitutional course of action\"). Seven factors supported the district\n\nclasses, challenged all students by removing \"fluff courses\" from the cur-\nriculum, provided tutors and other forms of staff support to accelerate\nstudent preparedness, and adopted pre-kindergarten programs to acceler-\nate preparedness for the youngest of students. See Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 273-275.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     39\ncourt’s good-faith finding: (1) no further relief has been sought since\nthe district court removed the case from the active docket in 1975; (2)\nCMS has gone above and beyond the court’s orders by continually\nstriving to achieve balance even when the imbalance was uncon-\nnected to the dual system; (3) the board has been open to community\ninput and sought community support for its integrative efforts; (4) the\nboard has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to desegregation\nthrough various resolutions; (5) African-Americans currently occupy\nfour of the nine seats on the school board, including the chair; (6) the\nboard’s actions over the past thirty years do not evince discriminatory\nmotives; and (7) \"no evidence has been presented that school authori-\nties were guilty of easily correctable errors.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 282-83.\n   Testimony from former board members indicated that the court’s\norder has been \"institutionalized,\" J.A. V-2222, and that the board \"al-\nways stuck to what the rules were.\" J.A. V-2234. Former Superinten-\ndent Murphy testified that when he arrived in Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhe found a \"unique\" environment where \"everybody wanted to make\nsure that their schools were racially balanced.\" J.A. VI-2686. In 1992,\nDr. Stolee suggested a magnet plan to increase integration, and, in the\ncourse of his recommendations, observed that \"[f]or the last twenty\nyears, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education and the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg community have, in good faith, complied\nwith the orders of the court.\" J.A. XXXII-15,570. He further observed\n\"that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board and community have a great\ndeal of pride in the fact that they successfully met a challenge and\nmade the solution work.\" J.A. XXXII-15,571.\n   Of course, both in the district court and in appellate arguments,\ncurrent CMS officials engaged in much self-recrimination and\nclaimed that they had not pursued the dismantlement of the dual sys-\ntem with the requisite zeal. Right on cue, the Swann plaintiffs\ndescribe this case as \"unique\" because CMS \"has acknowledged its\nown failure to comply with specific directives\" of the district court.\nSwann Plaintiffs’ Response to Petition for Rehearing at 10. The dis-\ntrict court gave little weight to CMS’s assertions that the board had\nnot put forth enough effort, and the evidence presented at trial amply\nsupports the district court in this regard. Former Superintendent Mur-\nphy testified that despite a report indicating that CMS was unitary and\nhis belief that CMS \"w[as] definitely in compliance,\" no effort was\n\f40      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nmade to dissolve the court order. J.A. VI-2706. Dr. Murphy gave\nthree reasons for the avoidance of a unitary status hearing. First, he\nadvised board members that the court hearing would be \"a long,\ndrawn-out process which would cost millions of dollars, and that\nwould be money taken away from the instructional program.\" J.A. VI-\n2706. Second, Dr. Murphy feared that if CMS was declared unitary\n\"we would not be eligible for federal funding for our magnet\nschools.\" J.A. VI-2706; see also J.A. XXII-10,563 (CMS report\nobserving that \"school districts that intend to use magnet schools for\ndesegregation purposes can apply for grants from the federal govern-\nment\"); J.A. XXI-10,521 (1996-1997 Federal Magnet School Assis-\ntance Program Evaluation Report in which CMS describes federal\nfunding as \"an integral part\" of its pupil assignment plan). Finally, Dr.\nMurphy thought it best to remain under court order so CMS could\ncontinue to racially balance schools even though the de jure violation\nhad been remedied.\n   Dr. Susan Purser, the current associate superintendent of education\nservices of CMS, expressed a similar desire for CMS to remain under\ncourt order. Though Dr. Purser testified that she believed that the\nschool board, superintendent, and administration were dedicated to\nenhancing educational opportunities for all of CMS’s students regard-\nless of race, she nonetheless expressed a preference for court supervi-\nsion. Dr. Purser pointed out that the current \"Board has only a limited\ntime, because these are elected positions,\" J.A. XVII-8076, and that\nover time \"superintendents will change, [and] the people involved in\n[CMS] will change.\" J.A. XVII-8077. At this point in the cross exam-\nination, counsel asked Dr. Purser: \"But you don’t know what any\nfuture School Board or administration will do either way, do you?\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser responded: \"That’s exactly my point.\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser’s testimony and that of Dr. Murphy exem-\nplify why the Supreme Court has stressed that \"federal supervision of\nlocal school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy\npast discrimination.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247; see also Coalition to\nSave Our Children, 90 F.3d at 761 n.6 (warning of \"the potential for\nthe entrenchment of [a] putatively transitional desegregation\nscheme\"). The district court’s desegregation orders were not intended\nto continue after CMS remedied the de jure violation, nor were they\nintended to suspend the democratic process with no prospect of resto-\nration. Yet the orders have been institutionalized to the point that\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     41\nCMS officials cannot imagine life without them. Once a yoke meant\nto steer CMS towards compliance with the Constitution, the orders\nare now used by CMS officials as mechanisms for the attainment of\ndifferent goals. In truth, CMS officials have little desire for a unitary\nstatus determination and are struggling to keep the orders firmly in\nplace.\n   Ironically, CMS’s clinging to the temporary desegregation orders\nbuttresses the district court’s finding that it is unlikely \"CMS would\nreturn to an intentionally-segregative system.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. at 284. If CMS will go to such lengths to keep the court’s\norders in place so that it may continue racial balancing and other poli-\ncies, it is unthinkable that CMS will attempt to revive the dual system.\nAccordingly, the district judge’s finding of good faith is not clearly\nerroneous.\n                      I. CMS’s Remedial Plan\n   As a response to the plaintiff-intervenors’ push for unitary status,\nCMS developed a \"remedial plan\" addressing many of the Green fac-\ntors and other ancillary factors. See J.A. XXIII-11,028. The district\ncourt dismissed the remedial plan as a \"‘litigation strategy’ plan\" and\ndeclined to consider it. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 256. CMS and\nthe Swann plaintiffs characterize the district court’s treatment of the\nremedial plan as a fundamental error of law that requires reversal of\nthe unitary status determination. First, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs\naver that the district court misconstrued the test for unitary status.\nAdopting the test crafted by the panel opinion, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs assert that a district court must consider (1) what a school\ndistrict has done, and (2) what a school district may do in the future.\nSee Belk, 233 F.3d at 252-53. Because the district court did not under-\ntake the latter inquiry as to the remedial plan, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs argue that the district court’s order must be reversed. This\nproffered two-part test is divined from Supreme Court cases which\nhave instructed district courts to ask \"whether the Board ha[s] com-\nplied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered,\nand whether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50; see also\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n  While we agree with the first prong of the test, we do not agree that\nexamining \"whether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been\n\f42     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\neliminated to the extent practicable,\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50,\nrequires a district court—as a matter of law—to consider a remedial\nplan conceived, drafted, and offered by one of the parties during the\nlawsuit as an obvious defense to it. The plain meaning of the relevant\nlanguage is that in some desegregation cases simple compliance with\nthe court’s orders is not enough for meaningful desegregation to take\nplace. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 25 (stating that \"a district court’s reme-\ndial decree is to be judged by its effectiveness\"). For example, a\ndecree entered in the 1960s or 1970s could have underestimated the\nextent of the remedy required, or changes in the school district could\nhave rendered the decree obsolete. In either case, a district court must\nlook beyond mere compliance with the original decree and ask\nwhether the vestiges of the dual system have been eliminated to the\nextent practicable. In the present case, the district court undertook\nsuch an inquiry. Not only did the district court address compliance,\nbut it also looked beyond the original decree and examined how the\nextensive changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area have affected\nthe dismantling of the former dual system. Hence, the district court\nwas not required under Dowell and Freeman to have considered\nCMS’s eleventh-hour remedial plan.\n   Likewise, the district court did not run afoul of Federal Rule of\nEvidence 402 when it refused to consider the remedial plan. Rule 402,\nof course, declares that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible.\" Fed.\nR. Evid. 402. Even relevant evidence may be excluded, however,\nwhen its probative value is substantially outweighed by consider-\nations of the needless presentation of cumulative evidence. See Fed.\nR. Evid. 403. And CMS’s remedial plan was certainly cumulative, cit-\ning and summarizing several expert reports which had been admitted\ninto evidence. For example, the plan’s discussion of faculty assign-\nment is based on the reports of Dr. William Trent, Dr. Robert\nPeterkin, and Dr. Roslyn Mickelson; the plan’s discussion of facilities\nis based on Dr. Gardner’s report; the plan’s discussion of the achieve-\nment gap between blacks and whites is based on the reports of Dr.\nTrent, Dr. Peterkin, and Dr. Mickelson; and the plan’s student assign-\nment discussion is based on Dr. Gordon Foster’s report. All of the\naforementioned reports were admitted into evidence and the authors\nof the reports testified at the hearing and were subject to cross-\nexamination. Hence, much of the remedial plan was cumulative, pro-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      43\nviding the district court with but a rehashing of expert reports and tes-\ntimony.\n   To the extent that the remedial plan contained relevant evidence\nappearing nowhere else in the record, we hold that the exclusion of\nsuch evidence was harmless. According to Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure 61, a \"court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard\nany error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the sub-\nstantial rights of the parties.\" Listing myriad deficiencies, objectives,\nand strategies, the thirty-one page remedial plan is often short on spe-\ncifics. Considering the amount of evidence presented on every aspect\nof CMS’s operations during other phases of the two-month bench\ntrial, we cannot hold that the exclusion of the remedial plan affected\nCMS’s substantial rights. See Ingram Coal Co. v. Mower, L.P., 892\nF.2d 363, 366 (4th Cir. 1989) (applying Rule 61). Because the exclu-\nsion of the remedial plan in no way renders the judgment below sus-\npect, the district court’s treatment of the plan cannot support reversal.\n                            J. Conclusion\n   Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the district court’s unitary sta-\ntus determination in toto. The district court’s findings on the Green\nfactors and the ancillary factors are bereft of clear error and we cannot\ndiscern any error of law affecting the substantial rights of the parties.\nAfter more than three decades of federal court supervision, CMS has\ncomplied in good faith with the mandate of Brown embodied in the\ndistrict court’s desegregation orders to achieve a unitary school sys-\ntem. The dual system has been dismantled and the vestiges of prior\ndiscrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable.\n   This is not to say that CMS is a perfect school system—it is not.\nLike school systems across the nation, CMS faces an expanding pupil\npopulation, aging facilities, and a scarcity of funds. These difficulties,\nhowever, are not vestiges of the former de jure system and therefore\ndo not have constitutional implications. Considering CMS’s exem-\nplary efforts in eradicating the segregated school system, we are con-\nfident that de jure segregation is history.\n                         III. Magnet Schools\n  I turn now to Capacchione’s challenge to CMS’s 1992 magnet\nschools plan. Specifically, Capacchione contends that his daughter\n\f44      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nCristina was unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school\nprogram on account of her race. Capacchione does not argue that race\nshould not have been a factor in the magnet admissions process, but\nthat the inflexible quotas, which operated to leave seats in these spe-\ncialized schools vacant despite long waiting lists, went beyond what\nwas permissible under prior court orders and the Constitution.\n   As noted previously, CMS operated its schools in nearly perfect\nracial balance for almost twenty years under a pupil assignment plan,\nadopted by the board and approved by the district court in 1974,\nwhich primarily utilized paired elementary schools, satellite atten-\ndance zones, a feeder system, and three experimental \"optional\nschools.\" See Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103-05; J.A. XXVIII-13,536-\n44. In 1991, however, CMS hired Dr. Stolee to examine racial imbal-\nance that was being caused anew by the demographic shifts and popu-\nlation growth in Mecklenburg County. The result of Dr. Stolee’s\nlabors was a new pupil assignment plan, entitled \"CMS Student\nAssignment Plan: A New Generation of Excellence.\" This new plan\nemphasized the use of magnet schools, which would allow CMS to\nphase out the unpopular paired elementary schools. Magnet schools,\nmany of which were located in predominately black neighborhoods,\noffered a specialized curriculum or innovative instructional styles not\nfound in the other schools in the system.\n   Former Superintendent Murphy oversaw implementation of the\nStolee plan and testified that the magnet program was adopted\nbecause CMS \"wanted to attract more white youngsters into the inner\ncity schools\" in order to meet CMS’s racial-balance goals. J.A. VI-\n2709. Dr. Stolee observed in his report that \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhas had a long and successful experience with mandatory school\nassignments,\" but that in order to combat demographic shifts CMS\nshould adopt a plan based on voluntarism. J.A. XXXII-15,581; see\nalso Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 92 (1995) (Jenkins III)\n(\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging voluntary move-\nment of students within a school district in a pattern that aids desegre-\ngation on a voluntary basis, without requiring extensive busing and\nredrawing of district boundary lines.\"); J.A. XXVIII-13,796 (student\nassignment plan boasting that \"Charlotte, the city which prides itself\non leading the nation in integration through busing, now has the\nopportunity to become the city to lead the nation in voluntary bus-\ning\"). A desegregation plan using magnet schools, according to Dr.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      45\nStolee, would \"give[ ] each parent an opportunity to make a choice\nbetween a school serving the area in which the family resides, a\nschool in some other area, or a school offering a very specific attrac-\ntive program.\" J.A. XXXII-15,580. Dr. Stolee also recognized that the\nmagnet-centered plan would be a dramatic shift from the prior deseg-\nregation plan which featured paired elementary schools, satellite\nattendance zones, and a feeder system. Thus, as part of the plan, he\nrecommended that CMS secure approval from the district court before\nmaking any changes. Indeed, Dr. Stolee’s \"RECOMMENDATION\n#1,\" out of forty-four, read:\n    THE SCHOOL BOARD, THROUGH LEGAL COUNSEL,\n    SHOULD APPROACH THE FEDERAL COURT TO\n    SECURE APPROVAL TO CHANGE THE COURT-\n    ORDERED DESEGREGATION PLAN.\nJ.A. XXXII-15,578. This recommendation was consistent with the\nprior district court order directing CMS to apply to the district court\n\"before making any material departure\" from the approved desegrega-\ntion plan. Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 270; see also J.A. XXVIII-13,790\n(board member requesting that Dr. Stolee \"review the federal court\norder\" to determine if the magnet plan was permissible). However,\nCMS ignored Dr. Stolee’s advice and the district court’s instruction,\nchoosing instead to withhold these changes in the desegregation plan\nfrom the district court.\n   The crux of the problem with CMS’s magnet school plan is its\nadmissions process. As aptly described by the district court, it oper-\nates as follows:\n    At the start of the process, CMS first fills seats with prefer-\n    ences based on whether the applicant lives in close proxim-\n    ity to the school and whether the applicant has any siblings\n    in the school. CMS then fills the remaining seats by select-\n    ing students from a black lottery and a non-black lottery\n    until the precise racial balance is achieved.\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 287 (internal citations omitted). As\noriginally explained to the board, the plan sought a balance of sixty\npercent white and forty percent black in the magnet schools with a\nplus or minus fifteen percent deviation. See J.A. XXVIII-13,705.\nUnfortunately, CMS opted for a strict ratio of sixty percent white and\nforty percent black, and decreed in its 1992 student assignment plan\n\f46      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nthat magnet \"slots reserved for one race will not be filled by students\nof another race.\" J.A. XXXII-15,702. The result of this policy was\nthat if a sufficient number of blacks or whites did not apply and fill\nthe seats allotted to their respective races, then those seats would be\nleft vacant. Though some exceptions were made, Superintendent Eric\nSmith testified that CMS generally adhered to the policy. See J.A.\nXV-7217.\n   The district court appropriately examined the magnet schools\nthrough a pre-unitary status lens, observing \"that the current litigation\nstarted not as a petition for unitary status but as a discrimination suit\narising out of Cristina Capacchione’s denial of admission to a magnet\nschool based on her race.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 284. The\ndistrict court recognized that school officials acting pursuant to a\ndesegregation order were immune from liability for actions taken con-\nsistent with that order. See Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694, 696\n(4th Cir. 1973) (law enforcement officials who confined the plaintiff\npursuant to a court order were immune from § 1983 suit); see also\nWolfe v.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\n                            A. Immunity\n\n   I begin with the question of whether CMS officials are entitled to\nimmunity because their actions in adopting and implementing the\nStolee magnet program in 1992 were taken pursuant to and were con-\nsistent with the desegregation orders and opinions issued by the dis-\ntrict court and Supreme Court in the early 1970s. In the main, CMS\nasserts that it is entitled to immunity for its act of implementing the\n1992 magnet schools program without court approval because the\nprior desegregation orders authorized the use of \"optional schools\"\nand a racial balance goal for filling them. Like the district court, I\nconclude that the magnet schools plan, as implemented, was not\nauthorized by the prior court orders and that, for the reasons stated\nhereafter, the CMS officials are not entitled to immunity.\n\n                   1. Magnet-Centered Program\n\n  As an initial matter, I note that prior court orders did not counte-\nnance implementation of a desegregation plan based primarily on\nmagnet schools. Never was CMS given carte blanche to adopt such\na program absent court review and approval. CMS counters that a\nmagnet-centered plan was permissible insofar as the district court\napproved the establishment of a few experimental optional schools in\n1974 as part of a plan utilizing paired elementary schools, satellite\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     49\nattendance zones, and a feeder system. See Swann, 379 F. Supp. at\n1103-04. What CMS fails to recognize is that optional schools were\nbut a small part of the plan approved in 1974, likely because the dis-\ntrict court was very skeptical about their efficacy as a desegregation\ntechnique. In the course of its order, the district court noted that the\nhistory of optional schools was marked by \"failure\" in a number of\nregards and warned CMS to be cautious in creating them. Id. at 1103.\nConsequently, CMS began with three experimental optional schools\nin 1974 and increased the number to only six by the early 1990s.\n\n   The optional schools created in the wake of the 1974 order placed\nmore \"emphasis on open or traditional education than normally\noffered in conventional schools.\" J.A. XXXII-15,683. The optional\nschools’ traditional programs \"offer[ed] an enriched and highly struc-\ntured education,\" J.A. XXXII-15,732, whereas the open programs\noffered a \"student-centered\" environment that \"encouraged [students]\nto take responsibility for their behavior and for their own learning.\"\nJ.A. XXXII-15,733. The optional schools approved by the 1974 order\nwere not as diverse and specialized as the magnet school program\nimplemented in 1992. The program suggested by Dr. Stolee offered\nschools specializing in traditional and open educational methods and\ncreated specialized schools featuring the Montessori method; science,\nmathematics, and technology; foreign language immersion; learning\nimmersion programs for young children; enhanced education for aca-\ndemically gifted students; and communication studies programs. See\nJ.A. XXXII-15730-41. However, both the optional schools and the\nmagnet schools were designed to achieve the same end result—the\nattraction of students to a school in a particular location by using a\nspecialized curriculum or teaching technique. Thus, Dr. Stolee, in rec-\nommending the magnet program in 1992, observed that CMS, via its\noptional schools, \"had some experience in such specialized schools.\"\nJ.A. XXXII-15,580.\n\n   Despite the district court’s 1970 directive that CMS obtain court\napproval for material modifications to the court-imposed desegrega-\ntion plan, the court’s skepticism of optional schools, the approval pro-\ncess that took place in the ensuing years, and Dr. Stolee’s specific\nrecommendation in 1992 that CMS seek court approval for the new\nmagnet schools program, CMS inexplicably chose not to return to the\ndistrict court to obtain approval of the magnet schools plan. At appel-\n\f50     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\nlate argument before the entire court, CMS contended that the lan-\nguage in the 1970 order requiring court approval for material\ndepartures was superceded by the 1974 order. CMS points to no lan-\nguage in the 1974 order supporting this argument and its repeated\ncitations to and reliance on pre-1974 orders regarding other aspects\nof this case further call into doubt this new line of argument. More-\nover, the 1974 order made clear that \"[e]xcept as modified herein, all\nprevious orders of court remain in effect.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at\n1105 (emphasis added). Hence, the 1970 order’s requirement that\nCMS obtain leave of court \"before making any material departure\nfrom any specific requirement set out in the order\" remained binding\non school officials. Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 270.\n\n   Nevertheless, I recognize that magnet schools are frequently used\nby school districts under a desegregation order, see Milliken v. Brad-\nley, 433 U.S. 267, 272 (1977) (Milliken II) (approving of magnet\nschools as a desegregation tool), and that the district court \"encour-\naged [CMS officials] to use their full ‘know-how’ and resources to\nattain\" a desegregated school system, Swann 311 F. Supp. at 269.\nIndeed, the plaintiff-intervenors’ own expert has touted magnet pro-\ngrams as an \"effective way to attract sizable numbers of white stu-\ndents to predominately minority schools.\" David J. Armor, Forced\nJustice: School Desegregation and the Law 223 (1995). Thus, a mag-\nnet schools program, properly implemented, can no doubt be an effec-\ntive desegregation tool. However, a conclusion that CMS was free to\nadopt any form of magnet school program it might wish to see in\nplace does not flow from this general proposition.\n\n   I must forcefully disagree with CMS’s contention that the mention\nof optional schools in the 1974 order provided legal cover for the\nimplementation of an assignment plan depending almost entirely on\nmagnet schools. The portions of the district court order authorizing\n\"optional schools\" could perhaps be read in isolation as authorizing\nCMS’s use of \"magnet schools\" in more diverse, specialized areas,\nbut the order did not authorize CMS to unilaterally abandon pairing,\nsatellites, and feeders in exchange for a magnet-centered plan.\nDespite the import of the 1974 order, and without even a nod to the\ndistrict court, CMS in 1992 abandoned the approved desegregation\nplan in favor of magnets. By the end of the decade CMS had created\nfifty-eight magnet programs—a far cry from the six optional schools\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     51\nin operation in the school year just prior to the adoption of the Stolee\nplan. See J.A. XXXIV-16,721-30. CMS describes this abandonment\nof the prior plan as but an expansion of the approved use of optional\nschools. Clearly, this \"expansion\" was in reality a substantial restruc-\nturing and cannot be squared with the unambiguous directives of prior\norders.\n\n                           2. Strict Ratios\n\n   Even if I could conclude that a magnet-centered plan was permitted\nunder prior court orders, the plan implemented by CMS is nonetheless\nultra vires because it combines a rigid ratio of sixty percent white and\nforty percent black with a policy decreeing that \"slots reserved for one\nrace will not be filled by students of another race.\" J.A. XXXII-15,702.9\nIn 1970, the district court issued a desegregation order to CMS, not-\ning that the order was \"not based upon any requirement of ‘racial bal-\nance.’\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 267 (emphasis added). The court\nreiterated \"that efforts should be made to reach a 71-29 ratio in the\nvarious schools so that there will be no basis for contending that one\nschool is racially different from the others, but . . . that variations\nfrom the norm may be unavoidable.\" Id. at 267-68 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the guide-\nlines set forth in the district court’s order and also addressed the sub-\nject of racial quotas. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 23-25.\n\n   With regard to the district court’s goal of achieving a racial balance\nof seventy-one percent white and twenty-nine percent black, the Court\ntook care to note that \"[t]he constitutional command to desegregate\nschools does not mean that every school in every community must\nalways reflect the racial composition of the school system as a\nwhole.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24. But central to the issue now before\nus, the Court held that had the district court\n  9\n   My colleagues in the majority on this issue eloquently argue that\nCMS was permitted to take race-conscious measures when complying\nwith desegregation orders. With this I agree—a school district under\norder to desegregate must of course take race into account when assign-\ning students. The primary question regarding the magnet program, how-\never, is whether CMS ran afoul of the Supreme Court’s prohibitions\nagainst inflexible ratios, not whether race-conscious measures are per-\nmissible.\n\f52       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\n       require[d], as a matter of substantive constitutional right,\n       any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that\n       approach would be disapproved and we would be obliged to\n       reverse.\n\nId. See also Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ. v. Scott, 404\nU.S. 1221, 1227 (1971) (Burger, C.J., in chambers) (describing as\n\"disturbing\" the school board’s \"understanding that it was required to\nachieve a fixed ‘racial balance’ that reflected the total composition of\nthe school district\"). The goal was upheld, only upon the condition\nthat \"use made of mathematical ratios was no more than a starting\npoint in the process of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible\nrequirement.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 25.\n\n   Just two years after the Supreme Court, in this very case, made\nclear that strict ratios were unacceptable, the district court, in a care-\nfully worded order permitting CMS to create optional schools,\napproved an intentionally flexible enrollment formula of \"about or\nabove 20% black students.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1104 (emphasis\nadded). The district court recognized that the \"actual enrollment of the\noptional school may have to be guided by its racial composition and\nby the number drawn from each other school area, not by consider-\nations of space and program only.\" Id. at 1108. Additionally, the dis-\ntrict court’s order directed that \"[r]eassignments to optional schools\nmust not jeopardize the racial composition of any other school.\" Id.\nThese modifications, however, at no time set a racial ratio of the type\ndisapproved of by the district court in its earlier orders and by the\nSupreme Court in its 1971 review of the district court’s 1970 order.10\n  10\n     I also disagree with the assertion that the Supreme Court’s disap-\nproval of inflexible racial quotas as a desegregation tool is solely a limi-\ntation on a district court’s remedial power. While the Swann Court did\nimply that a school board, exercising its discretion, could \"conclude . . .\nthat in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each\nschool should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflect-\ning the proportion for the district as a whole,\" 402 U.S. at 16, this is cer-\ntainly not the state of the law today nor was it the state of the law in 1992\nwhen the magnet plan was adopted. At the very least, the Supreme Court\ndecisions in Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267, 283\n(1986) (plurality opinion applying strict scrutiny to a school board’s\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      53\n   CMS asserts that the inflexible racial limits adopted in the 1992\nmagnet-centered plan were countenanced by the 1974 order discuss-\ning optional schools.11 In making this argument, CMS ignores the dis-\ntrict court’s choice of words in the 1974 order (\"about or above 20%\nblack students\"), see Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1104, and points to an\nattachment to the order designated as Exhibit A. This exhibit, a pro-\nposed pupil assignment plan drafted by CMS and a citizens advisory\ngroup, called for optional school enrollment \"at or above approxi-\nmately a 20% black ratio.\" Id. at 1108 (emphasis added). From this\nlanguage, CMS concludes that strict quotas were permitted. CMS’s\nconcentration on just a portion of the relevant language (\"at or\nabove\") edits out the word \"approximately,\" which does not suggest\nrigidity. Even if Exhibit A could be read as requiring rigid quotas,\nCMS disregards the fact that the district court approved the guidelines\n\"subject to the further conditions stated\" in the 1974 order. Id. at\n1103. With the Supreme Court’s admonition about strict quotas in\nmind, the district court chose its language carefully, observing that\noptional schools should \"have about or above 20% black students.\"\nId. at 1104. Hence, it is the district court’s understanding and modifi-\ncation of the pupil assignment plan that controls, not CMS’s tortured\nreading. Under a just construction, it is clear that the 1974 order did\nnot approve a use of race to the extent that CMS could deny eager\n\nrace-based layoff program), and City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,\n488 U.S. 469, 494 (1989) (applying strict scrutiny to a racial set-aside\nprogram), should have alerted CMS that it could not rely on the \"pluralis-\ntic society\" passage from the 1971 opinion when crafting a magnet\nadmissions policy that was outside the scope of the desegregation orders.\nBy 1992 such a use of race was not merely discretionary. Prevailing case\nlaw required that the racial classification be narrowly tailored to achieve\na compelling state interest. See J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 494. And\nas demonstrated in section III.B, the admissions policy was in no sense\nnarrowly tailored.\n   11\n      In contending that rigid ratios were not used by CMS, several of my\ncolleagues observe that not a single magnet school achieved the precise\nratio of sixty percent white students and forty percent black students.\nThis is not surprising insofar as the policy was designed to leave seats\nvacant. The very act of leaving seats vacant will compel a deviation from\nthe stated goal. However, this in no way undermines a finding of rigidity.\nInstead, such a result illustrates the policy’s inflexibility.\n\f54      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\napplicants an otherwise available slot in a magnet program solely on\naccount of the applicant’s race. Both the district court and the\nSupreme Court in this very case consistently rejected the use of such\nrigid racial quotas.\n\n   I also find no authorization for the board’s adoption of the magnet\nschools program in the Supreme Court’s 1971 approval in Swann of\na majority-to-minority transfer policy that would prevent, for exam-\nple, an African-American child in a majority white school from trans-\nferring to a majority black school because the transfer would increase\nthe degree of segregation in the affected schools. See Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 26. Because the majority-to-minority transfer policy, like the mag-\nnet admissions policy, prevents a child from enrolling in the public\nschool of his choice, CMS argues that the magnet admissions policy\nis permissible. By definition, however, CMS’s specialized magnet\nprograms are not tantamount to conventional public schools. While a\nchild denied a transfer from one conventional school to another still\nreceives the same general education, a child denied admission to a\nspecialized magnet program does not receive a similar benefit in a\nconventional school. In other words, an education in a magnet school\noffering, for example, foreign language immersion, is not inter-\nchangeable with an education in a conventional public school.12\nHence, the effect of the magnet admissions policy is far different from\nthe majority-to-minority transfer policy.\n\n   Unfortunately, the end result of the challenged magnet schools\nadmissions policy is placement of racial quotas ahead of educating\nstudents—an inappropriate result nowhere countenanced in the dis-\ntrict court’s orders or in the Supreme Court’s desegregation decisions.\nCf. Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 463\n(1972) (holding that courts should not approve a desegregation plan\n  12\n    I recognize that parents might perceive that one \"fungible\" conven-\ntional school is superior to another because of a number of intangibles\nsuch as the reputation of teachers or the newness of facilities. However,\nthese \"personal preferences\" do not rise to a level of constitutional signif-\nicance. See Hampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F. Supp. 2d\n358, 380 n.43 (W.D. Ky. 2000). Magnet schools, on the other hand, are\na completely different animal and therefore the admissions process used\nmust be more closely scrutinized.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     55\nif the plan offers \"‘quality education’ to some children, [but] has a\nsubstantial adverse effect upon the quality of education available to\nothers\"). In fact, Brown I struck down segregated schooling because\nchildren were denied equal educational opportunities. See Brown I,\n347 U.S. at 493. While school boards were permitted to use race in\nassigning students in order to convert to a unitary system, see North\nCarolina State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 46 (1971) (hold-\ning that the use of race in pupil assignments is \"one tool absolutely\nessential to fulfillment of [a school board’s] constitutional obligation\nto eliminate existing dual school systems\"), neither the Brown opin-\nions nor the district court orders implementing them ever contem-\nplated that remedial use of race, like the old dual system, would deny\nsome students educational opportunities solely because of their race.\nSee Brown I, 347 U.S. at 493 (holding that an educational opportunity\nprovided by the state \"must be made available to all on equal terms\");\nsee also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 305 (Powell, J.) (\"When a classification\ndenies an individual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely\nbecause of his race or ethnic background, it must be regarded as sus-\npect.\").13 Indeed, in bringing suit in 1965, the Swann plaintiffs, in\naccord with the Brown opinions, simply asked that CMS convert \"into\na unitary nonracial system wherein the educational opportunities\noffered by [CMS] are made available to students without regard to\nrace or color.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,162 (original complaint filed by the\nSwann plaintiffs).\n\n   An admissions policy that uses rigid racial quotas to deny an avail-\nable, unclaimed slot in a specialized magnet school to a child,\nwhether black or white, on account of the child’s race cannot be\nsquared with the district court’s orders or the Supreme Court’s deseg-\nregation decisions. Since 1971 it has been perfectly clear that mathe-\nmatical ratios may be used as \"a starting point in the process of\nshaping a remedy,\" but not as \"an inflexible requirement.\" See Swann,\n  13\n    Though the present case was brought on behalf of a white child\ndenied admission to a magnet school, the policy as written could have\njust as easily denied a black child admission to the magnet school. See\nHampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 377\n(W.D. Ky. 2000) (racial quota in a magnet school resulting in black stu-\ndents being denied admission even though the school was several hun-\ndred students below capacity).\n\f56      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n402 U.S. at 25. The district court took heed of this admonition in 1974\nwhen it permitted the creation of optional schools with \"about or\nabove 20% black students.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1104 (emphasis\nadded). However, CMS in 1992 ran afoul of the rule announced by\nthe Supreme Court when it crafted strict racial ratios designed to\nleave open magnet school seats empty, rather than permitting wait-\nlisted students to compete for the slots. Because nothing short of intel-\nlectual gymnastics can transform the clear meaning of the Supreme\nCourt’s Swann opinion or the district court’s 1974 order into vehicles\ncountenancing the rigid use of racial ratios, I agree with the district\ncourt that the policy is ultra vires and that CMS officials are not enti-\ntled to immunity.\n\n                         B. Equal Protection\n\n   Having determined that the CMS officials are not entitled to immu-\nnity for the implementation of the strict race-based magnet school\nassignment policy, I now turn to the question of whether the officials’\nact of implementing the policy without prior court approval, albeit\nwhile under an order to desegregate schools, runs afoul of the Equal\nProtection clause. I would hold that it does.\n\n   Under the Fourteenth Amendment, \"[n]o State shall . . . deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S.\nConst. amend XIV, § 1. By guaranteeing equal protection, the\nAmendment recognizes that \"[d]istinctions between citizens solely\nbecause of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free peo-\nple whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\"\nHirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943). The Supreme\nCourt has refused to make exceptions for so-called \"benign\" racial\nclassifications, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200,\n227 (1995), and the Court has made clear that \"all racial classifica-\ntions, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor,\nmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny,\" id.14\n  14\n     The Supreme Court’s application of strict scrutiny has indeed been\nunwavering. In Adarand, the Court refused to apply a lesser standard of\nscrutiny to racial classifications enacted by Congress. Though Congress\nitself is charged with enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment’s promise of\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD           OF   EDUCATION       57\n   To survive strict scrutiny, CMS’s use of race in the magnet admis-\nsions program \"must (1) serve a compelling governmental interest and\n(2) be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\" Tuttle v. Arlington\nCounty Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698, 704 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. dismissed,\n120 S. Ct. 1552 (2000). CMS avers that the magnet admissions policy\nwas adopted to remedy the effects of the dual school system previ-\nously operated in Mecklenburg County. Without question, remedying\n\nequal protection via \"appropriate legislation,\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV,\n§ 5, the Supreme Court in interpreting the Fifth Amendment held Con-\ngress to the same rigorous standards applicable to states and localities.\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224 (observing \"that any person, of whatever\nrace, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the\nConstitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to\nunequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny\").\n  CMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that strict scrutiny does not\napply when a school district is under court order to dismantle the dual\nsystem. Such an approach, however, ignores two of the three pillars of\nSupreme Court’s equal protection analysis: skepticism of all racial pref-\nerences and consistent application of heightened scrutiny regardless of\nthe race of the person burdened or benefitted. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at\n223-24. Contrary to the assertions of CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, the\napproach I would adopt does not deprive a school board under court\norder of the necessary tools required to establish a unitary school system.\n    The point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the gov-\n    ernment in support of a racial classification, and the evidence\n    offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to\n    distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in govern-\n    mental decisionmaking. . . . Strict scrutiny does not \"trea[t] dis-\n    similar race-based decisions as though they were equally\n    objectionable\"; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all govern-\n    mental race-based decisions in order to decide which are consti-\n    tutionally objectionable and which are not.\nId. at 228 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). This careful\nevaluation demanded by the Supreme Court will preserve inviolate\nproper desegregation remedies while ensuring that in the process of\ndesegregating a government actor does not stand equal protection on its\nhead by denying some students educational opportunities solely because\nof their race.\n\f58      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nthe effects of past discrimination is a compelling state interest. See\nCity of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989).\n\n  In reviewing whether a policy is narrowly tailored to serve a com-\npelling state interest, a court considers factors such as:\n\n     (1) the necessity of the policy and the efficacy of alterna-\n     tive race neutral policies;\n\n     (2) the planned duration of the policy;\n\n     (3) the relationship between the numerical goal and the\n     percentage of minority group members in the relevant popu-\n     lation;\n\n     (4) the flexibility of the policy, including the provision of\n     waivers if the goal cannot be met; and\n\n     (5) the burden of the policy on innocent third parties.\n\nSee United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987) (plurality\nopinion). Like the district court, I would hold that the CMS magnet\nadmissions policy is not narrowly tailored to the compelling interest\nof remedying past discrimination.\n\n   First, the magnet admissions policy was not necessary to comply\nwith the court’s order to dismantle the dual educational system. CMS\nhad a number of options available to it that would not have deprived\nchildren, solely on account of their race, an available seat in a special-\nized magnet program. Instead, CMS opted for rigid racial limits that\nwere clearly prohibited by the district court’s orders and the Supreme\nCourt’s desegregation decisions. Nor is there evidence in the record\nthat added flexibility or a waiver provision would have undermined\nthe use of magnet schools as a desegregation technique. The evidence\nsimply does not reveal that the magnet admissions policy used was\nthe only efficacious option available to CMS.\n\n  Second, this circuit has emphasized that \"[t]he use of racial prefer-\nences must be limited so that they do not outlast their need; they may\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     59\nnot take on a life of their own.\" Hayes v. North State Law Enforce-\nment Ass’n, 10 F.3d 207, 216 (4th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Like the district court, I can find \"no mention of the\nduration that CMS would use racially segregated lotteries, vacancies,\nand waiting lists.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. In light of\nCMS’s desire to remain under court order for the indefinite future, see\nsupra Part II.H, the lack of a duration for the magnet admissions pol-\nicy is not surprising. CMS was apparently content, in a number of\ninstances, to leave available magnet seats empty despite the waiting\nlists.\n\n   Third, I agree with the district court that \"the 60-40 numerical goal\nis related to the relevant population, i.e., the racial composition of\nschoolchildren in CMS.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. How-\never, there is no evidence that CMS considered the \"practicability of\nachieving this precise ratio in every magnet school,\" id. at 290, or the\nvery real danger that magnet schools would be underutilized because\nseats would be left open despite an abundance of applicants. The\nresult of the admissions policy is but another indication that the CMS\nadministration, in the words of former Superintendent Murphy, \"was\nmore focused on balance than on [educational] outcomes.\" J.A. VI-\n2687.\n\n   Fourth, the district court aptly described the inflexibility in the\nmagnet admissions policy: \"The Court is hard-pressed to find a more\nrestrictive means of using race than a process that results in holding\nseats vacant while long waiting lists full of eager applicants are virtu-\nally ignored.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. The policy is\nindeed \"restrictive,\" but it also borders on obduracy. The policy con-\ntained no written waiver provision which, once again, shows a lack\nof concern that these highly specialized schools could and would be\nunderutilized.\n\n   Finally, the innocent parties affected are children denied magnet\nslots solely because of their race and parents who \"must wait for\nmonths without knowing where their children eventually will be\nplaced.\" Id. at 290. A child’s education is one of the greatest concerns\nof the family, and CMS unnecessarily causes much agonizing when\nit places children of the \"wrong color\" on waiting lists while it\n\f60      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\nactively recruits children of the \"right color\" to fill empty magnet\nschool seats.\n\n   In sum, the magnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored. The\npolicy is not necessary to dismantle the de jure system, is for an\nunlimited duration, provides for virtually no flexibility, and burdens\ninnocent children and their families. The policy quixotically purports\nto establish equal protection of the laws in the realm of public educa-\ntion by denying children an equal opportunity to compete for open,\nunclaimed slots in CMS’s extraordinary magnet schools. The with-\nholding of seats from white students after all African-American chil-\ndren wishing seats have been given them is most certainly not a\nnarrowly tailored program. Such a result calls to mind why strict scru-\ntiny is used in the first place: \"Of all the criteria by which men and\nwomen can be judged, the most pernicious is that of race.\" Maryland\nTroopers Ass’n v. Evans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1076 (4th Cir. 1993). Teach-\ning young children that admission to a specialized academic program\nwith available seats is contingent on their race is indeed pernicious,\nand CMS’s magnet admissions policy can in no way be described as\nnarrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of remedying past\ndiscrimination.15\n\n                   C. Award of Nominal Damages\n\n   After finding a constitutional violation in the magnet schools, the\ndistrict court held CMS \"nominally liable in the amount of one dol-\nlar.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. CMS argues that the nomi-\nnal damages awarded were unjustified because the actions resulting\nin a constitutional violation were taken in good faith. CMS fears that\n  15\n     CMS also presented diversity as an alternative compelling state inter-\nest. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. In this circuit, it is unsettled\nwhether diversity may be a compelling state interest. See Eisenberg v.\nMontgomery County Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 130 (4th Cir. 1999), cert.\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 1420 (2000). Assuming without deciding whether\ndiversity may be a compelling state interest, I would hold that the magnet\nadmissions policy again fails because it is not narrowly tailored. Whether\nthe interest is remedying past discrimination or diversity, the admissions\npolicy as currently written is in no sense narrow. It is difficult to imagine\nany interest for which the magnet admissions policy is narrowly tailored.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     61\nthe damages award will \"open the door to numerous suits by other\nstudents who could claim that they did suffer actual damages and\nargue that collateral estoppel prevents CMS from denying liability.\"\nDefendants-Appellants’ Brief at 24. Regarding nominal damages, the\nSupreme Court has observed:\n\n    Common-law courts traditionally have vindicated depriva-\n    tions of certain \"absolute\" rights that are not shown to have\n    caused actual injury through the award of a nominal sum of\n    money. By making the deprivation of such rights actionable\n    for nominal damages without proof of actual injury, the law\n    recognizes the importance to organized society that those\n    rights be scrupulously observed; but at the same time, it\n    remains true to the principle that substantial damages should\n    be awarded only to compensate actual injury or, in the case\n    of exemplary or punitive damages, to deter or punish mali-\n    cious deprivations of rights.\n\nCarey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978) (nominal damages avail-\nable for denial of procedural due process rights) (footnote omitted);\nsee also Price v. City of Charlotte, 93 F.3d 1241, 1246 (4th Cir. 1996)\n(stating that \"the rationale for the award of nominal damages being\nthat federal courts should provide some marginal vindication for a\nconstitutional violation\").\n\n   In the present case there was indeed a constitutional violation.\nCMS ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause when it adopted a strict\nracial quota designed to deny an available, unclaimed slot in a spe-\ncialized magnet school to a child on account of the child’s race. In\norder to recover nominal damages, Cristina Capacchione need not\nprove that absent the unconstitutional policy she would have been\nadmitted to the magnet program. The injury in the present case is not\nthe ultimate inability to enroll in the magnet school, but the inability\nto compete for seats on an equal basis. See Northeastern Florida\nChapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville,\n508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). Though the two open \"black seats\" at the\nOlde Providence magnet school were eventually awarded to white\nchildren, the fact remains that the official magnet admissions policy\nprohibited children like Cristina from competing for the open slots.\nIn fact, CMS left the two available \"black seats\" at Olde Providence\n\f62      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nunfilled for most of the summer while Cristina and over one hundred\nother white children languished on a waiting list. In Orwellian fash-\nion, CMS marketed Olde Providence as \"a school to benefit every-\none,\" but in reality permitted only a select few to compete for the\nbenefits bestowed.\n\n   The nominal award in this case recognizes the importance of equal\nprotection under the law and provides some measure of vindication.\nAs for CMS’s worry about collateral estoppel, liability has already\nbeen established, and vacating the nominal damages would not\nchange this. Consequently, I would affirm the district court’s award\nof nominal damages.\n\n                        IV. Injunctive Relief\n\n   After recounting the unitary status determination and the constitu-\ntional violation in the magnet admissions policy, the district court\nenjoined \"CMS from any further use of race-based lotteries, prefer-\nences, and set-asides in student assignment.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 292. CMS challenges the district court’s injunction as\nunwarranted and overbroad. We review the grant of a permanent\ninjunction for an abuse of discretion. See Tuttle, 195 F.3d at 703.\n\n   Before a court grants a permanent injunction, the court must first\nfind necessity—a danger of future violations. See Connecticut v. Mas-\nsachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 674 (1931) (stating that an injunction \"will\nnot be granted against something merely feared as liable to occur at\nsome indefinite time in the future\"); United States v. Oregon State\nMed. Soc’y, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952) (\"All it takes to make the cause\nof action for relief by injunction is a real threat of future violation or\na contemporary violation of a nature likely to continue or to recur.\");\nBloodgood v. Garraghty, 783 F.2d 470, 475 (4th Cir. 1986) (\"An\ninjunction is a drastic remedy and will not issue unless there is an\nimminent threat of illegal action.\"). Though a flexible tool, an injunc-\ntion may not be used for \"punishment or reparations for . . . past vio-\nlations.\" Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. at 333.\n\n   The district court’s finding of a threat of future violations centered\non CMS’s offering of diversity as a compelling state interest. This\ninterest was offered after the district court decided that the admissions\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      63\npolicy should be reviewed using strict scrutiny. Because in this circuit\nit is unsettled whether diversity may be a compelling state interest,\nsee Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 130\n(4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1420 (2000), it was improper\nfor the district court to base its injunction on CMS’s unsuccessful\ndefense of the policy. At this point, we can discern nothing in the\nrecord indicating that CMS will ignore the district court order and\ncontinue to use race in an unconstitutional manner in the operation of\nthe magnet schools or other schools in the system. CMS represented\nto the district court both during and after trial that it had no intention\nof continuing the magnet plan. In moving for a stay of the injunction,\nCMS did not ask that the injunction be stayed as to the magnet\nschools, and was prepared to comply immediately with the court’s\norder. CMS requested a stay as to the non-magnet schools because\nover 50,000 students were likely to be reassigned in a short period of\ntime. Moreover, there was no evidence presented at trial about what\nCMS proposed to do as a unitary school system. A post-unitary status\nstudent assignment plan was never given to the district court, and the\nevidence simply does not indicate that \"there is an imminent threat of\nillegal action.\" Bloodgood, 783 F.2d at 475.\n\n   A finding of unitariness brings a fresh start for the school board—\nan opportunity to operate a school system in compliance with the\nConstitution. The prospective relief awarded by the district court is in\ntension with the resumption of local control, which is one of the ulti-\nmate goals of any desegregation order. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490.\nFreeing the school district from one court order only to shackle it with\nanother was here an abuse of the district court’s discretion, and we\ntherefore vacate the grant of injunctive relief.\n\n                       V. Discovery Sanctions\n\n   The district court sanctioned CMS for failing to supplement its\nanswers to interrogatories that sought a list of witnesses. We review\nthe district court’s management of discovery under the abuse of dis-\ncretion standard. See Anderson v. Foundation for Advancement, Educ.\n& Employment of Am. Indians, 155 F.3d 500, 504 (4th Cir. 1998).\nThe record reveals that no list of fact witnesses was presented to the\nplaintiff-intervenors until five days before the trial date. At that time,\nCMS presented a list of 174 witness, which was later cut to twenty-\n\f64      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nsix. The plaintiff-intervenors moved for sanctions and the district\ncourt granted the motion in part. The district court continued the trial\nfor one week so that the plaintiff-intervenors could depose the newly\ndisclosed witnesses, and the court held CMS accountable for the fees\nand expenses of these depositions.\n\n   We have developed a four-part test for a district court to use when\ndetermining what sanctions to impose under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 37. Specifically, \"[t]he court must determine (1) whether\nthe non-complying party acted in bad faith, (2) the amount of preju-\ndice that noncompliance caused the adversary, (3) the need for deter-\nrence of the particular sort of non-compliance, and (4) whether less\ndrastic sanctions would have been effective.\" Id. An examination of\nthe four factors reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court.\n\n   First, there is ample evidence of bad faith. Early in the case, the\nplaintiff-intervenors presented CMS with an interrogatory asking for\ndisclosure of trial witnesses. In response to the interrogatory, CMS\nstated that it would provide appropriate information concerning wit-\nnesses at the time and in the manner specified by the district court.\nThe plaintiff-intervenors moved to compel discovery, and the court\nagreed with CMS that the request was premature. However, the court\ninstructed CMS to \"supplement its responses [to the interrogatories],\nas it promised, when such information becomes known.\" J.A. I-195.\nAs an excuse for its untimely disclosure of fact witnesses, CMS relies\non the district court’s pre-trial order, which provides that \"[a] witness\nlist containing the name of every proposed witness\" should be filed\nwith the court on the first day of trial. J.A. I-150. This provision of\nthe pre-trial order was clearly for the court’s convenience and could\nnot reasonably be interpreted to apply to disclosures to the other par-\nties. Besides, even if such an interpretation were reasonable, the dis-\ntrict court’s command to supplement interrogatories superceded the\npre-trial order. Accordingly, bad faith is evident.\n\n   Second, the presentation of such a lengthy witness list on the eve\nof trial to the plaintiff-intervenors was prejudicial. Without the action\nof the court, the plaintiff-intervenors would have had no opportunity\nto depose the witnesses, much less properly prepare for trial. Thus,\nCMS’s failure to supplement interrogatories was prejudicial.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      65\n   Third, such non-compliance with the district court’s orders cer-\ntainly needed to be deterred. The district court’s condonation of\nCMS’s bad faith at a time so close to the beginning of trial could have\nencouraged repetition of improper conduct. As found by the district\ncourt, the record indicates that the failure to supplement interrogato-\nries was not the first time CMS \"was lacking in candor in disclosing\nrelevant and important information.\" J.A. I-305. Hence, deterrence\nwas essential to a proper management of this case.\n\n  Finally, less drastic sanctions would not have been effective. Per-\nmitting the plaintiff-intervenors to depose witnesses and requiring\nCMS to pay fees and expenses for the depositions was appropriate.\nCMS was fortunate to receive such a light sanction, and it is doubtful\nwhether lesser measures would have had any effect on CMS’s con-\nduct.\n\n  In sum, the discovery sanctions imposed did not amount to an\nabuse of the district court’s discretion.\n\n                          VI. Attorney Fees\n\n   CMS argues that the district court erred in awarding attorney fees\nto the plaintiff-intervenors. While conceding that Grant is entitled to\nfees if the district court’s unitary status finding is upheld, CMS argues\nthat Capacchione cannot be a prevailing party on this issue. CMS also\nchallenges Capacchione’s receipt of fees based on the district court’s\nmagnet schools ruling because (1) Capacchione received only nomi-\nnal damages, and (2) young Capacchione would not have been admit-\nted to the magnet program even if race was not a factor insofar as her\nlottery number was so high. The district court’s decision to award\nattorney fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Hitachi\nCredit Am. Corp. v. Signet Bank, 166 F.3d 614, 631 (4th Cir. 1999).\nI would affirm.\n\n                A. Attorney Fees for Unitary Status\n\n                                    1.\n\n   In my view, the plaintiff-intervenors are entitled under § 1988 to\nattorney fees for their successful litigation of the unitary status issue.\n\f66      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nIndeed, CMS has conceded that if we upheld the declaration of uni-\ntary status, Grant would be entitled to attorney fees.\n\n     Unlike Capacchione, the Grant intervenors were granted\n     declaratory and injunctive relief related to the issues of uni-\n     tary status and CMS’ magnet school admission policies.\n     Therefore, the entitlement of the Grant intervenors to\n     recover attorneys’ fees is tied directly to the merits of those\n     claims.\n\nCMS’s Brief at 39-40. Surprisingly, despite CMS’s concession, a\nmajority of this court vacates the award of fees to both Capacchione\nand Grant.\n\n   By obtaining a declaration of unitary status, the Grant plaintiffs,\nalong with Capacchione, finished what the original Swann plaintiffs\nstarted. If we deny the plaintiff-intervenors the ability to be compen-\nsated in a situation such as this—where an incredible amount of legal\nwork is required and the board, for improper reasons, clings to the\ncourt’s order—then we give to litigants like the Swann plaintiffs\neffective control over the decision of \"when\" or even \"if\" a unitary\nstatus hearing will be sought because they would be the only ones\nwho could ever obtain reimbursement for their legal fees. The practi-\ncal consequences are scarcely more apparent than in this case, where\nthe only party ruled entitled to obtain attorney fees for finishing the\njob was opposed to seeing unitary status declared. This, coupled with\nthe fact that the plaintiff-intervenors received a court order in their\nfavor on the unitary status question as a continuation of the original\n§ 1983 action, leaves me at a loss to see how the district court’s award\nof attorney fees to them under § 1988 can be reversed.\n\n   Under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988(b) (West Supp. 2000), \"[i]n any action\nor proceeding to enforce a provision of [§ 1983 and other civil rights\nlaws] . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party,\nother than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the\ncosts.\" To be considered a prevailing party, a party must \"succeed on\nany significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit\nthe parties sought in bringing suit.\" Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103,\n109 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      67\n   This case began in 1965 as a § 1983 action with the Swann plain-\ntiffs seeking conversion of CMS \"into a unitary nonracial system\nwherein the educational opportunities offered by [the board] are made\navailable to students without regard to race or color.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,162 (original Swann complaint commencing an action under\n§ 1983); see also Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S.\n658, 697 (1978) (observing that school desegregation actions \"have\nalmost without exception been § 1983 suits\"). In essentially a continu-\nation of what was begun in 1965, Capacchione, believing that CMS\nhad established a unitary school system, brought suit pursuant to\n§ 1983 and prayed that the district court enter a declaration of unitary\nstatus. See J.A. I-110 (Capacchione amended complaint seeking a\ndeclaration of unitary status); see also JA. I-140 (Grant complaint\nseeking a declaration of unitary status); cf. Waste Mgmt. Holdings,\nInc. v. Gilmore, No. 00-1185, 2001 WL 604325 (4th Cir. June 4,\n2001) (§ 1983 action seeking declaratory relief). Shortly after Capac-\nchione filed suit, the Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann and\nto consolidate it with Capacchione’s action. The district court granted\nthe Swann plaintiffs’ motion and later permitted Capacchione to inter-\nvene in Swann. Grant, who also sought a declaration of unitary status,\nthen moved to intervene in the consolidated action, and the district\ncourt granted his motion. After months of litigation, the plaintiff-\nintervenors succeeded in having CMS declared unitary, and this court\nhas affirmed on appeal.\n\n   With the prior court orders now dissolved, CMS must cease using\nthe orders to assign Grant’s children as well as all other public school\nstudents on account of their race.16 A unitary school system is what\n  16\n    CMS argues that because Capacchione no longer resides in North\nCarolina the unitary status declaration does not alter CMS’s behavior\ntoward young Capacchione and consequently Capacchione is not a pre-\nvailing party entitled to fees. In other words, CMS contends that Capac-\nchione’s lack of standing counsels against an award of fees. I disagree.\nAt the very least, because of Capacchione’s status as a plaintiff-\nintervenor in Swann, Capacchione is still entitled to fees. See Shaw v.\nHunt, 154 F.3d 161, 167 (4th Cir. 1998) (noting that when plaintiffs with\nstanding \"secure[ ] precisely the relief that they sought,\" plaintiff-\nintervenors who lack standing but contributed to the litigation may also\nbe awarded attorney fees). Grant, who CMS concedes has standing and\nis entitled to fees, achieved the relief originally sought—a declaration of\nunitary status. Capacchione greatly contributed to this result, and under\nShaw is entitled to fees just as Grant.\n\f68      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nthe original plaintiffs sought in 1965, and the plaintiff-intervenors\nhave greatly assisted in the final stages of this litigation in making\nunitariness a reality. Henceforth, unless CMS’s use of racial classifi-\ncations satisfies the requirements of strict scrutiny, the color of a\nchild’s skin will no longer be a permissible basis for assigning, or\nrefusing to assign, a child to a conventional public school or a special-\nized magnet program. See Farrar, 506 U.S. at 110 (observing that\ndeclaratory relief may constitute relief under § 1988 \"if[ ] it affects\nthe behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff\") (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Moreover, this declaration of unitary status is\nenforceable against CMS in the unlikely event it later attempts to con-\ntinue prior assignment polices, say, on the ground that vestiges of\nprior discrimination have not been eradicated. See id. at 111 (explain-\ning that to be a prevailing party an enforceable judgment must be\nobtained).\n\n   In the present case, with its counter-intuitive alignment of parties,\nthe plaintiff-intervenors have stepped into the shoes of the Swann\nplaintiffs, continued the original § 1983 action, and brought this case\nto a close. Just as the Swann plaintiffs, prior to removal of the case\nfrom the active docket, were compensated for their services, see\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 66 F.R.D. 483\n(W.D.N.C. 1975) (awarding the Swann plaintiffs $204,072.33 in fees\nand costs), so too should the plaintiff-intervenors be compensated for\na continuation of the legal efforts to achieve a unitary school system\nand to remove federal court control. In this regard the plaintiff-\nintervenors have acted as \"private attorney[s] general,\" Independent\nFed’n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 758-60 (1989)\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original), and\nobtained a finding of unitariness, which was the ultimate objective of\nthe original action. See J.A. XXXIII-16,162 (original complaint seek-\ning \"reorganization of the school system into a unitary nonracial sys-\ntem\"). Indeed, no one disputes that the Swann plaintiffs would have\nbeen entitled to fees if they had taken the initiative to petition for a\ndeclaration of unitary status instead of acting to oppose the result we\nreach today.\n\n   Without question, the monitoring of a school desegregation decree\nis crucial to the dismantling of the dual system. See Jenkins v. Mis-\nsouri, 967 F.2d 1248, 1251 (8th Cir. 1992) (awarding fees in desegre-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      69\ngation case pursuant to § 1988). Accordingly, efforts \"to insure full\ncompliance and to ensure that the plan is indeed working to desegre-\ngate the school system[ ] are compensable services.\" Northcross v.\nBoard of Educ., 611 F.2d 624, 637 (6th Cir. 1979). Here, the plaintiff-\nintervenors observed CMS’s progress in dismantling the dual system,\nand once convinced that full compliance had been achieved, they\nmoved for a declaration of unitary status. In so doing, the plaintiff-\nintervenors were faced with a recalcitrant school board that insisted\nnone of the Green factors had been satisfied. The Swann plaintiffs,\nthough having never returned to court to complain about the continua-\ntion or revival of segregative practices, suddenly claimed that the dual\nsystem was not being dismantled and joined the school board in the\nquest for continuation of court supervision. Though most of the vital\ninformation was in the hands of CMS’s officials, who were often\nuncooperative in the discovery process, see Capacchione, 57 F. Supp.\n2d. at 292-293 (cataloging sanctions and threats of sanctions against\nCMS), the plaintiff-intervenors persevered and ultimately obtained a\ndeclaration of unitary status. But for the actions of the plaintiff-\nintervenors, CMS, though having dismantled the dual system, would\nstill be using the district court’s orders as mechanisms for attaining\nother goals. Despite the progress of the last three decades, CMS was\napparently content to forestall a finding of unitariness for the foresee-\nable future. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490 (observing that restoration\nof local control \"at the earliest practicable date\" is a goal of any\ndesegregation order). Consequently, I believe that the plaintiff-\nintervenors, for stepping in and finishing what was begun in 1965, are\nentitled to attorney fees under § 1988 for their litigation of the unitary\nstatus issue.\n\n                                    2.\n\n   I would also affirm the plaintiff-intervenors’ award of attorney\nfees, based on the unitary status declaration, under this circuit’s\nexceptional circumstances doctrine. See Rolax v. Atlantic Coast Line\nR. Co., 186 F.2d 473, 481 (4th Cir. 1950) (holding that absent a stat-\nute attorney fees are normally unavailable unless \"the taxation of such\ncosts is essential to the doing of justice . . . in exceptional cases\"). To\navoid a declaration of unitary status, CMS has clung to the desegrega-\ntion decree for improper reasons, see supra part II.H, and the equita-\nble remedy ordered in 1969 \"would be far from complete, and justice\n\f70      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nwould not be attained, if reasonable counsel fees were not awarded\"\nto the plaintiff-intervenors. Bell v. School Bd. of Powhatan County,\n321 F.2d 494, 500 (4th Cir. 1963) (en banc) (awarding attorney fees\nin school desegregation case based on exceptional circumstances\nwhen the school board engaged in a \"pattern of evasion and obstruc-\ntion\" which \"cast[ ] a heavy burden on the children and their par-\nents\"). A contrary result would hamper the involvement of concerned\ncitizens in school desegregation litigation and permit school boards\nthat are inclined to remain under court order to eschew a unitary sta-\ntus hearing.\n\n   I recognize that the Supreme Court recently rejected the catalyst\ntheory as a basis for awarding attorney fees. See Buckhannon Bd. &\nCare Home v. West Virginia Dep’t of Health & Human Res., 121\nS. Ct. 1835 (2001). However, the award of fees in the present case has\nnever been based on the catalyst theory, \"which posits that a plaintiff\nis a prevailing party if it achieves the desired result because the law-\nsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant’s conduct.\" Id.\nat 1838 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, there was no\nvoluntary change in CMS’s conduct. CMS clung to the desegregation\norders and put up a vigorous defense in the course of a two-month\ntrial. A final judgment was handed down, and any change in CMS’s\nbehavior will be due to the district court’s decree, not a voluntary act.\nWhile a \"voluntary change in conduct . . . lacks the necessary judicial\nimprimatur on the change\" for a plaintiff to be considered a prevailing\nparty, a declaration of unitary status is far different. Id. at 1840. Once\nfound to be in violation of the Constitution, a school district cannot\nbe declared unitary without the order of a court. Because the district\ncourt’s order, and not a voluntary act, is the impetus behind any\nchange, the rejection of the catalyst theory in Buckhannon does not\nundermine an award of attorney fees based on the exceptional circum-\nstances doctrine of Rolax.\n\n        B. Attorney Fees for the Magnet Schools Litigation\n\n   I would also find that Capacchione is entitled to fees because he\nis a prevailing party on the magnet schools issue. The district court\nheld that the magnet schools admissions policy violated the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and awarded nomi-\nnal damages in light of the constitutional violation. In Farrar, the\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     71\nSupreme Court specifically addressed the issue of nominal damages\nand prevailing party status:\n\n    We therefore hold that a plaintiff who wins nominal dam-\n    ages is a prevailing party under § 1988. . . . A plaintiff may\n    demand payment for nominal damages no less than he may\n    demand payment for millions of dollars in compensatory\n    damages. A judgment for damages in any amount, whether\n    compensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant’s behav-\n    ior for the plaintiff’s benefit by forcing the defendant to pay\n    an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\n\n506 U.S. at 112-13 (internal citations omitted). The award of nominal\ndamages constitutes relief on the merits and affects CMS’s behavior\ntoward Capacchione if only by forcing CMS to pay. Hence, Capacch-\nione is a prevailing party. See also Shaw v. Hunt, 154 F.3d 161, 164\n(4th Cir. 1998) (noting that \"persons within the generic category of\nplaintiff-intervenors have often been found by courts to fit within the\nrubric ‘prevailing party’ for fees purposes\"). That young Capacchione\nhad a high lottery number is irrelevant for a determination of prevail-\ning party status. As previously stated, the injury in this case was the\ninability to compete for open magnet seats, not the denial of admis-\nsion to a magnet program. Because I would find that Capacchione\nrightly prevailed on the magnet schools issue, I would affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s award of attorney fees for work in this area as well.\n\n                                  VII.\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, a majority of this court affirms the dis-\ntrict court’s declaration of unitary status and the imposition of discov-\nery sanctions. We vacate the district court’s injunction because we\ncan discern no danger of future violations. Additionally, I would\naffirm the finding of a constitutional violation in the magnet schools\nadmissions policy, the award of nominal damages, and the attorney\nfees awarded pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988.\n\nWILKINSON, Chief Judge, concurring in part:\n\n   I concur in Parts I, II, IV, and V of Judge Traxler’s thorough opin-\nion. With respect to Parts III and VI, I respectfully take a different\nview.\n\f72      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\n                                    I.\n\n   There can be no doubt that if the 1992 Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nmagnet school program were adopted today, it would be unconstitu-\ntional and in violation of our holdings in Tuttle v. Arlington County\nSch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698 (4th Cir. 1999), and Eisenberg v. Montgomery\nCounty Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123 (4th Cir. 1999). Those holdings\nproperly emphasize the ecumenical premise of the Fourteenth\nAmendment that every American citizen regardless of race or ethnic-\nity is deserving of equal dignity under the law.\n\n   The more difficult question is whether the adoption of the magnet\nschool program in 1992, at a time when the school board was under\na court desegregation order, stripped the Board of its immunity. I\nwould hold that it did not. Inasmuch as the Board did not forfeit its\nimmunity, I would vacate the award of damages against it and the\nfees and costs assessed thereon.1\n\n   Both the Supreme Court’s Swann opinion and various lower court\nopinions relied for many years upon numerical benchmarks as an\nindicia of progress in achieving school desegregation. That emphasis,\nhowever, was primarily the work of the courts, not the school board.\nAnd judicial decisions further made clear that the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg school board could take the numerical approach of the\ncourts even further in the course of devising desegregative remedies\nof its own.\n\n  For instance, in Swann, the Supreme Court itself held that: \"School\nauthorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate\n  1\n    Although the Grant plaintiffs have prevailed with regard to the unitary\nstatus determination, their basis for prevailing was not an action under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. Accordingly, there exists no statutory basis here for\ndeviating from the American Rule. Under this rule, fees are not generally\nawarded to prevailing parties \"absent explicit statutory authority.\" Buck-\nhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources, 532 U.S. ___, No. 99-1848, slip op. at 3-4 (May 29,\n2001) (internal quotation omitted). And the Supreme Court has empha-\nsized that the judiciary enjoys no \"roving authority\" to award counsel\nfees \"whenever the courts might deem them warranted.\" Id. at 12.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     73\nand implement educational policy and might well conclude . . . that\nin order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school\nshould have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting\nthe proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an educational\npolicy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.\"\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971)\n(emphasis added).\n\n   Likewise, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 501\nF.2d 383 (4th Cir. 1974) (en banc) (per curiam), parents of white stu-\ndents brought suit against the school board because it allegedly had\nestablished a set-aside for African-American students to take part in\nits gifted students program. Id. at 383. This court affirmed an injunc-\ntion prohibiting the plaintiffs from proceeding in state court. We held\nthat the plaintiffs’ suit could affect the school board’s efforts to com-\nply with prior federal court desegregation orders, including one which\nrequired the Board to assign students in such a manner that the\nschools would have about the same proportion of African-American\nand white students. Id. at 384.\n\n   And the district court’s desegregation orders in this case can fairly\nbe read to encourage, rather than foreclose, the conduct in which the\nschool board here engaged. For instance, in 1970, Judge McMillan\nordered that \"the defendants maintain a continuing control over the\nrace of children in each school, . . . and maintain the racial make-up\nof each school . . . . The defendants are encouraged to use their full\n‘know-how’ and resources to attain the results above described, and\nthus to achieve the constitutional end by any means at their disposal.\nThe test is not the method or plan, but the results.\" Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265, 268-69\n(W.D.N.C. 1970) (emphasis added). And four years later, in an order\naddressing optional schools, which were the precursors of the magnet\nschools, Judge McMillan ordered that: \"Strict and central control\nmust be exercised over all admissions (reassignments) to each\noptional school in order to fulfill the necessary ends that these schools\n. . . be integrated by grade at or above approximately a 20% black\nratio.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 379 F. Supp.\n1102, 1108 (W.D.N.C. 1974) (emphasis added).\n\n While this case was removed from the active docket in 1975, Judge\nMcMillan noted that: \"This case contains many orders of continuing\n\f74      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\neffect, and could be re-opened upon proper showing that those orders\nare not being observed.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 67 F.R.D. 648, 649 (W.D.N.C. 1975); see also Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 475 F. Supp. 1318, 1340\n(W.D.N.C. 1979) (upholding the school board’s 1978 pupil assign-\nment plan which took into consideration the race of the student).\n\n   Magnet schools are a widely used desegregation device. It is true\nthat in the early 1990’s, the school board in its magnet program\neagerly accepted the courts’ invitation to rely upon numerical bench-\nmarks. I believe, however, that it is necessary to afford a school board\nsome latitude in attempting to meet its desegregative obligations if we\nare not to undermine the rule of law. To do otherwise leaves the\nBoard between a rock and a hard place. Namely, if the school board\nfails to carry out the court desegregation order, it can be cited for con-\ntempt or held not to have achieved unitariness. But if the Board acts\naggressively to implement the court order, it risks facing judicial con-\ndemnation and the threat of litigation on the grounds that it was acting\nultra vires. This is not the kind of quandary into which we should\nforce institutions that are, for better or worse, under judicial decree.2\nSuch an approach risks undermining respect for courts and, indeed,\nencouraging just the opposite.\n\n   My fine colleague, Judge Luttig, insists that the issue here has\nsolely to do with racial quotas. I have strongly disapproved of the use\nof such quotas. See, e.g., J. A. Croson Co. v. City of Richmond, 822\nF.2d 1355 (4th Cir. 1987), aff’d, 488 U.S. 469 (1989); Maryland\nTroopers Ass’n, Inc. v. Evans, 993 F.2d 1072 (4th Cir. 1993). Indeed\nI believe them to be inimical to a national future founded, as the Four-\nteenth Amendment requires, upon individual respect and mutual self-\nregard. Yet to see the sole issue here as racial quotas is to miss the\nforest for the trees. The cumulative message of innumerable court\norders conveyed to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg board over the course\nof many years was to do everything possible to desegregate Charlotte\nschools. See, e.g., Swann, 402 U.S. at 15 (\"[S]chool authorities are\n‘clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps\n  2\n    The quandary in fact is illustrated by this very case where five mem-\nbers of the court feel the Board went too far in its remedial efforts, and\nfour others believe just as strongly that the Board did not go far enough.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION      75\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial dis-\ncrimination would be eliminated root and branch.’\") (quoting Green\nv. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 437-38 (1968)) (emphasis added).\nAnd the school board attempted to do just that. To now condemn the\nBoard would be to sanction the future disrespect and disregard for\ncourt orders of all sorts. This I am unwilling to do.\n\n    If an existing court order is infirm, the better course is to modify\nit through customary court processes. Today, we follow this approach\nwith our determination that the school district has attained unitary sta-\ntus. This holding puts the school district on a race-neutral footing\ngoing forward, thereby granting it a truly fresh start. The solution to\nthe fundamental Fourteenth Amendment problems with the 1992\nmagnet school plan is not to hold the Board liable for its attempts to\nimplement the very policies, and attain the very ends, which the\ncourts had ordered it to do. The answer is to point to a unitary future\nin which the principle of non-discrimination will guide its public\nactions.\n\n                                    II.\n\n   I concur fully in Judge Traxler’s view that the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg school system has achieved unitary status. I recognize\nthat some citizens of Charlotte, aware of society’s shortcomings on\nmatters of race, may see in unitariness a mocking phrase. Others may\nview today’s embrace of local governance as an act of judicial aban-\ndonment. The luminosity of Brown v. Board of Education is such that\nmany have come to look at courts as our sole guiding lights. Yet they\nwere never meant to be such. If it was important that courts nurture\nthe task of desegregation in its infancy, it is equally essential that a\nschool district one day depart the comforting judicial homestead and\nstrike out on its own. School districts will be stronger for finding their\nown way. For in the long run, courts cannot serve as the sole source\nof hope in the difficult area of desegregation, nor democracy as the\nobject of fear. \"Returning schools to the control of local authorities\nat the earliest practicable date is essential to restore their true account-\nability in our governmental system. When the school district and all\nstate entities participating with it in operating the schools make deci-\nsions in the absence of judicial supervision, they can be held account-\n\f76      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nable to the citizenry, to the political process, and to the courts in the\nordinary course.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 490 (1992).\n\n   The question then is whether the Charlotte-Mecklenburg system is\nready for this step. The district court concluded that it was. See Rid-\ndick v. School Bd. of the City of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521, 533 (4th Cir.\n1986) (holding that the district court’s unitary status finding is\nreviewed for clear error). It is, I suppose, possible for us to reweigh\nthe evidence or to refract this or that school board decision through\na myriad of lenses. While any record, thus dissected, would be found\nto reveal its share of imperfection, a reversal of the district court’s\nfinding of unitariness would do a profound disservice to the people\nof Charlotte. The recent history of Charlotte, as Judge Traxler’s care-\nful opinion demonstrates, is not one of resistance and intransigence.\nRather it shows a community struggling to meet its desegregative\nobligations in a period of staggering demographic change. Most\nimportantly, African Americans are vigorous participants both in the\nelective and deliberative process with regard to Charlotte’s schools.\n\n   Of course, the majority’s sense of progress may be the dissent’s\nsense of great unfinished business. And let us suppose just for a\nmoment that both are right. Still, I doubt that interminable court pro-\nceedings can convey to Americans the sense that we are in the enter-\nprise of education together. For litigation depends for its energy on\nadversarial alignments, i.e., the school board and Swann plaintiffs are\ntentatively aligned, but the Swann plaintiffs and Capacchione plain-\ntiffs are decidedly not. And while democracy has no shortage of con-\nflict, reaching decision and compromise from within the community,\nas opposed to the external compulsion of court order, promises a bet-\nter mutual understanding and a firmer common ground.\n\n   That at least is the hope. In this sense, then, unitariness is not an\nact of abandonment but a covenant of faith. It reflects a judicial belief,\nwell supported by this record, that the invidious practices of an inde-\nfensible era have indeed been dismantled and that Charlotte has\nearned the right to begin anew. No decisions are more sensitive and\ndifficult than those involving public schools, and no process is more\nwrenching than that of matching limited resources to a limitless array\nof educational needs. But these challenges are better met by commu-\nnities than by courts and, after thirty-five years of sporadic judicial\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      77\nsupervision, the time has come to conclude. If not now, when? Each\nchild is a human being to educate. If this essential task of education\nhas become too daunting for democracy, then I know not who we are\nor what we shall become.\n\n  I am authorized to say that Judge Niemeyer joins in this opinion.\n\nWIDENER, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting:\n\n   I concur in or dissent from parts of the various opinions of the\ncourt and its various members, as indicated below, and I also respect-\nfully dissent to the failure of the court to review the items of the judg-\nment of the district court from which appeal is taken.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   We review judgments, not opinions, e.g. Chevron USA, Inc. v. Nat-\nural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984); Hyatt v. Sullivan,\n899 F.2d 329, 337 n.10 (4th Cir. 1990). The judgment of the district\ncourt, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, is divided into\nfive parts, which are:\n\n   1. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools are declared unitary in all\nrespects;\n\n  2. All prior injunctive orders or decrees in the Swann case are\nvacated and dissolved and the case is dismissed with prejudice;\n\n  3. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system shall pay nominal\ndamages to the Plaintiff-Intervenors in the amount of $1;\n\n  4. Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools are enjoined from assigning\nchildren to schools or to allocate educational opportunities on the\nbasis of race;\n\n   5. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system will pay reasonable\nattorneys fees, expert fees and costs of the Plaintiff-Intervenors.\n\n  And the district court, in another order, imposed sanctions on the\ndefendants. A copy of relevant parts of that order is also attached as\nExhibit B.\n\f78     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   I vote to affirm the judgment of the district court in each respect,\nincluding the sanctions order, except that I would vacate the judgment\nof the district court as to Item 4, listed in Part I above, only on the\nground it is unnecessary, the school board having given no indication\nthat it will not comply with the orders of the court in this case.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   Despite universally accepted appellate procedure that we review\njudgments, not opinions, the other members of this court, without\nmention of the judgment of the district court, have divided a per\ncuriam opinion into four issues, only the last two of which, concern-\ning injunctive relief and sanctions, relate directly to the judgment of\nthe district court we are reviewing. The first two issues, as stated in\nthe per curiam opinion of the court, are phrased by a floating major-\nity.\n\n   Only because each of those majorities declines to vote to affirm or\nreverse the various items of the judgment of the district court, I will\nattempt to relate my votes to the per curiam opinion.\n\n   As to Item 1, I vote that the school system has achieved unitary sta-\ntus. Also as to Item 1, I vote that the attorneys’ fees for work done\non the unitary status issue, and any other issue tried in this case,\nexcept a few dollars relating to Miss Capacchione’s moving, should\nbe granted. The majority, however, while it denies fees on \"the uni-\ntary status issue,\" apparently does not immediately mention the fees\nof Miss Cappacione’s attorneys, amounting to the sum of about\n$700,000, and one might think from reading the per curiam opinion\nthat they were yet awarded were it not for the next-to-the-last line of\nthe per curiam opinion denying fees \"for any reason.\"\n\n   As to Item 2 of the per curiam opinion, I am in agreement with the\ndistrict court, that the school board should have come back to it for\nauthority to establish magnet schools in which the race of the appli-\ncant was considered in deciding whether or not to grant admission.\nThe district court so construed its own orders, which it is best able to\ndo, and to which we must give due deference. Anderson v. Stephens,\n875 F.2d 76, 80 n.8 (4th Cir. 1989); Vaughns v. Board Educ. v. Prince\nGeorges County, 758 F.2d 983, 989 (4th Cir. 1985). I need go no fur-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      79\nther to affirm the holding of the district court. I am of opinion that\nMiss Capacchione’s Constitutional rights were violated when she was\nnot considered for admission to the magnet school program notwith-\nstanding her race and that she is entitled to nominal damages on that\naccount. Norwood v. Bain, 166 F.3d 2213 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\n\n    Also as to Item 2, although I feel that the question of immunity has\nlittle or nothing to do with this case, because it is being used to ratio-\nnalize that the successful attorneys do not get their attorneys’ fees and\nthat nominal damages for a Constitutional violation are not due, I vote\nthat the school board did not have immunity from the payment of\nattorneys’ fees, nor immunity from nominal damages, that is to say,\nin the language of the per curiam opinion, it has been forfeited.\n\n  As to Items 3 and 4, the per curiam opinion correctly states my\nvotes.\n\n                                   III.\n\n    With only slight interruptions, this case had been on inactive status\nfor 22 years until Christina Capacchione started the present litigation\nwhen she filed her first complaint on September 5, 1997, seeking to\nbe considered for admission to the magnet school program without\nregard to her race. When, on March 6, 1998, the district court ordered\nthe Swann litigation reactivated, upon the motion of the Swann plain-\ntiffs, it consolidated the Capacchione suit with the Swann litigation.\nMiss Capacchione then amended her complaint on March 16, 1998,\nto request a declaration that the school system had reached unitary\nstatus and moved on March 19, 1998 to intervene in the reactivated\nSwann litigation, which motion was granted. The Grant plaintiffs sub-\nsequently filed their complaint and motion to intervene in the Swann\nlitigation on April 8, 1998.\n\n  When Christina Capacchione filed her suit, the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg schools were only admitting students to the magnet\nschool program after having considered their race, and the school sys-\ntem was submitting itself to the racially-based pupil assignments\nimposed in response to the orders of the district court some years\nbefore, the suit having then been inactive for some 22 years. Now,\nfour years and almost $1.5 million later, and over the determined\n\f80      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nopposition of the school board, the school system has been held to be\nunitary and the magnet schools may no longer consider the race of the\napplicant in granting or denying admission. All this is at the instance\nof Christina Capacchione.\n\n   When the Swann plaintiffs filed their suit in 1965, more than 35\nyears ago, their complaint was that the race of students was consid-\nered in determining their assignment to schools, precisely the same\ncomplaint that Christina Capacchione had in 1997. When the Swann\ncase was declared to be inactive in 1975, the district court, at that\ntime, awarded attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiffs’ attorneys, for\nservice through 1974, in the amount of $204,072.33, and there are\ndoubtless other such items not presently readily available to me. For\nus to hold now that the Capacchione child and the Grant plaintiffs are\nnot entitled to the same consideration, as were the Swann plaintiffs,\nfor eradicating racial assignments is certainly not fair and not even\nlegal, in my opinion. How we are able to hold that the Capacchione\nand Grant plaintiffs and intervenors in this case are not successful\nparties in a § 1983 action strains reason beyond the breaking point. In\nmy opinion, they are due costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees, etc.\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\n  Especially to the holding of the en banc court, that the Capacchione\nand Grant plaintiffs and intervenors are not entitled to attorneys’ fees\nand costs, etc., I respectfully dissent.*\n\n  *My summary of such fees and costs is attached as Exhibit C.\n\f        BELK v.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD   OF   EDUCATION    87\n                                             Volume 3 of 4\n\f88      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nLUTTIG, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment in part and dis-\nsenting from the judgment in part:\n\n   I concur in the opinion of the court that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nSchool System is now unitary, following 35 years of federal court\nsupervision. I also agree with the conclusion reached by Judge Trax-\nler that the School Board acted without the required authorization\nfrom the district court both when it created its expansive magnet\nschool program and when it imposed a fixed quota to govern admis-\nsions to that program. Neither the creation of the magnet school pro-\ngram nor the imposition of a rigid quota governing admission into\nthat program were authorized by the district court, and both clearly\nconstituted \"material changes\" from the district court’s prior remedial\norders, requiring prior court approval. I also agree with Judge Trax-\nler’s narrowest conclusion that, absent a proven necessity for such, an\nadmissions program that permanently employs fixed ratios to deny\ncertain students, solely because of their race, the opportunity to com-\npete for seats that will otherwise be left unfilled even after all targeted\nminorities have been allotted seats (and I assume fixed ratios in a\nremedial context to be constitutional), is insufficiently tailored to\nwithstand scrutiny.\n\n  I address myself separately only to the question whether the district\ncourt authorized the strict mathematical quota adopted by the School\nBoard in 1992 to govern admissions to Charlotte-Mecklenburg’s mag-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      89\nnet school program, a quota that, as noted, required officials literally\nto leave seats unfilled even after all interested minority students had\nbeen afforded an opportunity to attend the magnet school of their\nchoice.\n\n                                    I.\n\n    With respect to the magnet school program’s admission policy, the\nholding of the district court that we review is that that court had\n\"firmly rejected the use of rigid racial quotas,\" 57 F. Supp. 2d 228,\n286 (W.D. N.C. 1999), and that, in contravention of those orders and\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 25 (1971), the School Board had \"us[ed] mathe-\nmatical ratios not as a starting point but as an ending point.\" 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 289. \"In policy and in practice, the [magnet schools’]\n60/40 ratio requirement [was] an inflexible quota[,]\" the district court\nfound, id. at 288, and \"slots reserved for one race [would] not be\nfilled by students of another race.\" Id. at 289. Indeed, the court\nobserved, \"it was not uncommon for the school year to begin with\nseats remaining vacant because students of one race would disrupt the\ndesired racial balance.\" Id. Accordingly, the district court held that the\nmagnet school program constituted a \"material departure\" from the\ncourt’s prior remedial orders. Id. at 287.\n\n   As to whether the rigid quota imposed by the School Board was\nauthorized by the district court, the question is not whether the court’s\norders authorized race-conscious admission decisions, as the School\nBoard argues, see Br. of Appellants Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of\nEducation, et al. at 20 (\"The particular desegregation tool struck\ndown by Judge Potter — magnet schools with race conscious admis-\nsions guidelines — has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme\nCourt and other courts as a valid exercise of the broad remedial dis-\ncretion of both district courts and school authorities.\"), and as Judge\nMotz and Judge Wilkinson contend by way of strawman. It is indispu-\ntable that race-conscious admission decisions were authorized by the\ndistrict court’s orders; not even the plaintiffs argue that they were not.\nNeither is the question whether parties are required to obey court\norders, the only question addressed by the authorities relied upon by\nJudge Motz; of course, they are. Nor is the question whether quotas\nwere \"foreclosed\" by the district court’s orders, as Judge Wilkinson\n\f90      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nalternatively maintains; it should be evident that a party does not\nreceive immunity for any and all conduct that is merely unforbidden\nby judicial order.\n\n   And finally, the issue is not whether racial quotas are or are not\nconstitutional. There simply is no occasion in this case for a general\nexpression of viewpoint as to the use of racial quotas and, although\nI am given pause over Judge Wilkinson’s express and categorical\nrejection of racial quotas, whatever the circumstance, I certainly\nexpress no such general view herein. I might well be presented with\ncircumstances in which I would conclude that racial quotas were\nessential to the vindication of constitutional right. And I would be\nmost reluctant to foreclose myself from such a conclusion in an\nappropriate circumstance by statements in a case in which the issue\nwas not even before the court.\n\n   Rather, the only issue relevant to the question of whether the\nSchool Board is entitled to immunity is whether the district court spe-\ncifically authorized the School Board’s imposition of rigid quotas\n(i.e., whether the Board was acting pursuant to court order in impos-\ning the fixed quotas), which denied students the opportunity to com-\npete for unfilled seats solely because of their race. If the court did\nspecifically authorize the use of fixed quotas, then the School Board\nis entitled to immunity; if it did not, then immunity is unavailable.\nThe authorities on this score are uniform. See, e.g., McCray v. Mary-\nland, 456 F.2d 1, 5 (4th Cir. 1972) (observing that the law provides\nimmunity for those whose actions are taken \"in obedience to a judicial\norder or under the court’s direction\"); see also Rogers v. Bruntrager,\n841 F.2d 853, 856 (8th Cir. 1988) (holding that clerks of court are\nimmune from damages arising from acts they are \"specifically\nrequired to do under court order at a judge’s direction\") (internal cita-\ntions omitted) (emphasis added); Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d\n455, 460 (3d Cir. 1969) (providing immunity for officers who act\n\"pursuant to\" a court order); cf. DeFelice v. Philadelphia Bd. of\nEduc., 306 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Pa. 1969) (extending immunity to\nschool boards that take actions pursuant to an order of a state commis-\nsion). Compare Wilkinson v. Forst, 832 F.2d 1330, 1334 (2d Cir.\n1987) (granting immunity to officers who conducted searches \"specif-\nically authorized\" by court orders) with Wooley v. City of Baton\nRouge, 211 F.3d 913, 927 (5th Cir. 2000) (denying immunity to offi-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     91\ncers who removed a child from a home without \"specific authoriza-\ntion\" by a court). Whether racial quotas are, as a general matter,\nconstitutional has nothing whatsoever to do with the resolution of this\nissue. If the district court authorized strict racial quotas, then the\nSchool Board is entitled to immunity whether or not such strict quotas\nare constitutional.\n\n   Judge Wilkinson misunderstands this issue altogether, as is evident\nfrom both his extended and unnecessary discussion of racial quotas\nin general and his mistaken observation that I \"insist\" \"the issue here\nhas solely to do with racial quotas.\" Judge Motz, in contrast, under-\nstands the issue presented, but errs in its resolution because of a reli-\nance upon fundamentally inapplicable authorities.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   Most certainly the district court did not specifically authorize the\nSchool Board to employ fixed quotas in the admission of students to\nits magnet schools, as the district court itself held. There is not even\nan argument that it did. Indeed, although fatal to their holding that the\nboard is entitled to immunity, Judges Motz and Wilkinson do not\neven suggest otherwise. Nor could they.\n\n   Not only the very district court in question, but the Supreme Court\nof the United States itself in this very litigation, both explicitly and\nconsistently disavowed the use and constitutional legitimacy of rigid\nquotas throughout the thirty-plus year history of Charlotte-\nMecklenburg’s desegregation efforts. In fact, in the course of this\nvery litigation, even the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board has\nstrenuously argued against the fact and the constitutionality of any\njudicially-imposed quotas by the district court.\n\n                                   A.\n\n  Beginning over thirty-two years ago, in this identical litigation,\nJudge McMillan himself acknowledged the well-recognized and well-\nunderstood distinction between race-conscious decisions and rigid\nquotas, which is ignored by Judge Motz and variously ignored and\nmisunderstood by Judge Wilkinson today. And he could not have\n\f92     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nbeen clearer that he would permit the former in pursuit of integration\nof the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, but forbid the latter —\nand he never wavered from that position. Said Judge McMillan at that\ntime, in terms whose import is unmistakable for the issue before us,\nalthough \"[r]ace may be considered in eliminating segregation in a\nschool system,\" Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, 306\nF. Supp. 1291, 1312 (1969), \"[f]ixed ratios of pupils will not be set.\"\nId. (emphasis added). Judge McMillan’s words bear repeating: \"Fixed\nratios of pupils will not be set.\" And in emphasis of the distinction he\ndrew between fixed ratios and race-consciousness, he noted that\nalthough \"efforts should be made to reach a 71-29 ratio in the various\nschools so that there will be no basis for contending that one school\nis racially different from the others, [it is necessary] to understand\nthat variations from that norm may be unavoidable.\" Id. (emphasis\nadded).\n\n   Only two months later, Judge McMillan repeated that his order\n\"[was] not based upon any requirement of ‘racial balance,’\" Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265, 267 (1970).\nHe explained in no uncertain terms that the earlier-referenced 71-29\nratio, which our court today holds specifically authorized imposition\nof an inflexible quota, was merely a starting point in pursuit of the\ngoal of desegregation. See id. at 267-68.\n\n   And a year later, Judge McMillan again explicitly rejected fixed,\nrigid quotas, re-emphasizing that \"‘racial balance’ is not required by\nthis court.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 318 F.\nSupp. 786, 792 (1970). Indeed, the court recited, the previous order\n\"expressly contemplated wide variations in permissible school popu-\nlation.\" Id.\n\n                                  B.\n\n   Not only did Judge McMillan, in his own orders, repeatedly reject\nthe use of fixed quotas, the Supreme Court of the United States, in\nreviewing Judge McMillan’s orders, categorically rejected even an\nurged construction of these orders that would authorize fixed quotas.\nIn reviewing Judge McMillan’s Order of February, 1970 (Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265 (1970)), the\nSupreme Court unambiguously stated, in a passage that should be dis-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      93\npositive of whether the district court previously, and certainly at any\ntime thereafter, specifically (or otherwise) authorized the use of quo-\ntas, that it affirmed Judge McMillan’s order only on the condition that\nit not be read to authorize fixed rigid quotas:\n\n      If we were to read the holding of the District Court to\n      require, as a matter of substantive constitutional right, any\n      particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that\n      approach would be disapproved and we would be obliged\n      to reverse. The constitutional command to desegregate\n      schools does not mean that every school in every commu-\n      nity must always reflect the racial composition of the school\n      system as a whole.\n\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 24 (1971)\n(emphasis added); see also Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of\nEduc. v. Scott, 404 U.S. 1221, 1227 (1971) (Burger, C.J., in Cham-\nbers) (describing as \"disturbing\" the School Board’s \"understanding\nthat it was required to achieve a fixed ‘racial balance’ that reflected\nthe total composition of the school district\"). Only a \"very limited\nuse\" of \"mathematical ratios,\" as a \"starting point,\" was within the\n\"equitable remedial discretion of the District Court,\" id. at 25, held\nthe Supreme Court.1\n\n   And, in perhaps the most powerful testament of all to the fact that\nthis district court never intended, much less specifically authorized a\nquota of a type the majority holds today that it did, the School Board\nitself expressly argued to the Supreme Court of the United States in\n  1\n    In the course of its opinion in Swann, the Court stated that a school\nboard, as opposed to a federal court, would possess the discretionary\npower to direct that its schools maintain \"a prescribed ratio of Negro to\nwhite students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole.\" 402\nU.S. at 16. Both Judges Motz and Wilkinson seize upon this passage as\nif it supported their holding that the School Board’s imposition of fixed\nquotas was permissible. Of course, as even the School Board realizes,\nthis is misplaced reliance, for whether or not the Board possessed inde-\npendent authority to impose the rigid quotas is entirely irrelevant to the\nonly question before us of whether the Board is entitled to immunity\nbecause it was acting upon order of the district court.\n\f94      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nSwann both that Judge McMillan \"disclaim[ed] any intent to require\nracial balancing,\" Respondent’s Br. at 24, and that the plain language\nof the district court order dealing with student enrollment (\"about or\nabove 20%\") actually did not set quotas.2 Indeed, the Board that\nbefore this court argues that racial quotas were authorized by Judge\nMcMillan, argued before the Supreme Court that it was beyond the\nconstitutional authority of the district court to impose quotas\n(\"absolutes\"), as such would have been based on the district court’s\nown \"subjective\" notions of right and wrong, not on the mandates of\nthe Constitution, Respondent’s Br., at 35, and would violate individ-\nual rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment \"of those blacks\nand whites caught up in the forced mass movement of children away\nfrom their neighborhoods.\" Id. at 52. In an observation that now\nacquires ironic overtones of its own in light of the School Board’s\ncurrent posture that quotas were authorized by the district court, the\nBoard in Swann argued with respect to its position (also rejected by\nthe Supreme Court) that, although not intended by Judge McMillan,\nhis order should nonetheless be construed as effectively requiring\nracial balancing, that \"[i]t is ironic that the counterpart of the compul-\nsion outlawed by Brown I and II is now employed in the name of the\nConstitution. Is it trite to suggest that two wrongs do not make a\nright?\" Id.\n\n                                    C.\n\n   If there were any question as to Judge McMillan’s rejection of\nfixed quotas, and frankly there can be none in the face of Judge\nMcMillan’s own disavowal and the Supreme Court’s explicit con-\ndemnation of such in Swann, it was answered with equal clarity\nrepeatedly by the district court in orders entered in the wake of\n  2\n   The petitioners in Swann, like the School Board, also argued that\nJudge McMillan neither intended nor imposed a quota in his desegrega-\ntion order. In a construction of the district court’s order that not only\ntracked the order’s unambiguous language, but was ultimately adopted\nby the Supreme Court, petitioners maintained that the court employed the\n71%-29% ratio merely as a \"starting guide,\" \"a specific, yet flexible\ngoal,\" \"‘expressed a willingness to accept a degree of modification,’\" and\n\"‘departed from it where circumstances required.’\" Petitioners’ Br., at 36,\n38, 66.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     95\nSwann, in which the court was at obvious and undeniable pains to\nrespect the Supreme Court’s injunction that inflexible quotas not be\nset.\n\n   In an order issued the same month after the Supreme Court’s deci-\nsion in Swann, Judge McMillan again confirmed that he neither\nauthorized nor permitted strict racial quotas. First, when the School\nBoard asked to close a school to improve racial balance, Judge\nMcMillan rejected the proposal decisively, finding deviations from\ntargeted percentages an insufficient justification for such action.\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346,\n1348 (1971) (refusing to close a school where the number of white\nstudents was less by two percent than that assigned to the school in\nthe beginning of the year and one percent greater \"than the proportion\ncalled for under the plan\"). And in language that belies any contention\nthat the court authorized strict quotas, Judge McMillan rejected a flat\nban on any student transfers that would alter the targeted composition\nof a school, instead ordering only that the School Board could not\nassign a child to a school or allow that child to attend a school differ-\nent from the one he was attending at the start of the school year, if\n\"the cumulative result of such assignment in any given period tends\nsubstantially to restore or to increase the degree of segregation in\neither the transferor or the transferee school.\" Id. at 1350 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n    Two years later, Judge McMillan employed essentially the same\ncarefully crafted language, again distinguishing between \"racial iden-\ntifiability\" on one hand and strict quotas on the other, Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 362 F. Supp. 1223, 1228-30\n(1973), invoking the language of \"reasonably stable [pupil distribu-\ntion],\" \"substantial [leeway for use of discretion and common sense],\"\nand \"[remedy for] gross unfairness [as the ‘legitimate target of a\ncourt,’ as contrasted with ‘perfect fairness’ which is ‘impossible to\nattain’].\" Id. at 1229, 1231, 1238.\n\n   And, finally, in 1974, the district court entered the order that the\nSchool Board contends, and Judges Motz and Wilkinson accept,\nauthorized the rigid quotas in dispute. Contrary to the Board’s asser-\ntion and my colleagues’ belief, however, that order, too, likewise\ncarefully and deliberately preserved the elementary distinction\n\f96     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nbetween flexible ratios as a starting point to bring segregation to an\nend, which the Supreme Court had held were constitutionally permis-\nsible, and strict quotas, which the Supreme Court had held were con-\nstitutionally impermissible. Retaining just that amount of flexibility\nessential to the exercise of what the Supreme Court only two years\nbefore had admonished was the limit of its constitutional power,\nJudge McMillan ordered only \"[t]hat the optional school enrollments\nwill be controlled starting with 1974 so that they are open to all\ncounty residents and have about or above 20% black students.\"\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 379 F. Supp. 1102,\n1104 (1974) (emphasis added). Fully aware that the Supreme Court\nhad forbidden imposition of quotas, the School Board itself did not\neven request authorization to impose strict quotas. Tellingly, the\nBoard only submitted for the district court’s approval a policy requir-\ning that each school maintain a black student population of \"at or\nabove approximately 20%.\" To anyone familiar with the history of the\nlitigation, and especially the Supreme Court’s then-recent explicit\nrejection of any construction of Judge McMillan’s orders that would\nimpose a quota on the School Board, as was the School Board, the\npurposeful distinction between race consciousness and rigid quota\ndrawn by Judge McMillan in his 1974 order could not be any clearer.\n\n                                  III.\n\n   Indeed, foregoing the implausible arguments embraced by the\nmajority, not even the School Board seriously argues before us that\nthe district court authorized strict quotas — which should be unsur-\nprising, given its own argument as early as 1970 that such were\nunconstitutional and its firsthand knowledge that the Supreme Court\nhad categorically rejected the use of such in this very litigation. To\nthe Board’s credit, it does not even attempt the argument made by\nJudges Motz and Wilkinson that the language of the district court\norders itself authorized quotas. Rather than focus on whether the dis-\ntrict court orders imposed or authorized rigid quotas, as to which it\nsays nothing, the Board noticeably and notably passes instead to the\nvery different argument that its admission policies were not, as a prac-\ntical matter, tantamount to insistence upon rigid quotas as evidenced\nby the ultimate variation in the racial make-up of the magnet schools.\nSee Appellants’ Reply Br. at 15; Appellants’ Br. at 21 (suggesting\nthat the \"manner in which CMS admitted students to its magnet\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      97\nschools was fully consistent with these orders and not rigid and\ninflexible\" because of the existence of \"[s]ignificant variance\" from\nthe initial goal). This \"[s]ignificant variance,\" of course, is not due to\nthe flexibility of the admissions process, but instead to its rigidity to\nthe extent of leaving unfilled seats that were reserved for a particular\nrace, even in the face of a waiting list of students of different races.\nIn any event, the ultimate demographics have no relevance whatever\nto the threshold question before us of whether the district court did\nor did not specifically authorize the Board to employ rigid quotas in\nadmissions to its magnet schools — a question as to which the School\nBoard’s silence speaks volumes.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n   The facts of the repeated explicit and consistent rejection of quotas\nby this district court in this very litigation for over thirty years; the\ncategorical rejection by the Supreme Court of the United States of any\nconstruction of the district court’s orders that would require rigid quo-\ntas; the School Board’s own argument before the Supreme Court in\nSwann that rigid quotas were never intended or ordered by the district\ncourt, and that, if they had been, such would be unconstitutional; and\nthe Board’s tacit (and frankly, candid, if indirect) concession in its\nbriefs before this court that the district court did not authorize rigid\nquotas, renders beyond any argument the plaintiff’s contention that\nthe School Board acted outside the scope of the district court’s orders\nwhen it adopted rigid quotas and refused to permit students to com-\npete for open seats based upon their race alone. Not merely had the\ndistrict court never authorized the School Board’s use of rigid quotas.\nIt had expressly stated that it would not do so, as the Board itself\nknew well. And, if this alone were not enough, at this very School\nBoard’s behest, the district court had been instructed by no less an\nauthority than the Supreme Court of the United States that it would\nhave been without the constitutional power to impose such an inflexi-\nble requirement on the county officials of Charlotte-Mecklenburg,\neven had it wanted to. The holding on this record that the district\ncourt authorized the use of strict quotas is, as best evidenced by the\npalpable lack of support summoned by the combined opinions of\nJudges Motz and Wilkinson on behalf of that holding, simply insup-\nportable.\n\f98     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   \"The cumulative message of innumerable court orders conveyed to\nthe Charlotte-Mecklenburg board over the course of many years\"\nactually was not, as Judge Wilkinson asserts, \"to do everything possi-\nble to desegregate Charlotte schools.\" Post at 74. It was to do \"every-\nthing possible\" to desegregate Charlotte-Mecklenburg’s schools,\nexcept employ strict racial quotas.\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ & ROBERT BRUCE KING, Circuit\nJudges:\n\n   A majority of the Court today reverses the district court’s finding\nthat the use of a race-based admission policy by the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education (\"CMS\" or \"Board\") in its expanded\nmagnet schools program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the\nConstitution of the United States — and thus vacates the attendant\ninjunction, monetary relief, and attorney’s fees award. Every signifi-\ncant aspect of the expanded magnet schools program, including the\nuse of racial proportions in assigning students to magnet schools, was\nauthorized by the judicial desegregation orders governing this case.\nThe Board’s obligation to obey these court orders insulates it from\nconstitutional attack for actions taken in compliance with them. It\nwould be the rankest injustice to find the Board liable for a constitu-\ntional violation, and subject to monetary damages and enormous\nattorney’s fees, when its expanded magnet schools program was sim-\nply a good-faith attempt to comply with the desegregation orders\nimposed by federal courts to remedy an unlawful dual school system.\nThus, for the reasons more fully explained in parts III, IV, V, and VI\nof this opinion, the magnet schools ruling must be reversed and the\naccompanying injunction, monetary damages, and attorney’s fees\naward must be vacated.\n\n   However, a separate majority severely errs in upholding the district\ncourt’s determination that CMS has achieved unitary status. This\nmajority expresses its \"satisfaction that CMS has dismantled the dual\nschool system.\" Traxler Op. at 7. For the reasons set forth in parts II\nand VIII of this opinion, no one should be satisfied at this time. Noth-\ning yet demonstrates that CMS has eliminated all vestiges of the\nunlawful discrimination that has long permeated its school system. In\nholding to the contrary, the majority has only succeeded here in dash-\ning the hopes of the citizens of Mecklenburg County, particularly\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     99\nthose of African-American descent, who have long fought for the fair\nand equitable implementation of the desegregation plan approved by\nJudge McMillan some thirty years ago. These successive generations\nof parents and children have been slowly starved by a well-meaning\n— but irresolute — governing body, whose sins have been absolved\nby the court below (and now by a majority of this Court) without any-\nthing but the most cursory examination. Although CMS has clearly\nachieved unitary status in certain respects, there remain several areas\nof primary concern that have not been subjected to anything\napproaching a proper constitutional analysis. We deplore, and believe\nthe Court itself may one day regret, the refusal of a present majority\nto recognize this.\n\n                                   I.\n\n                                   A.\n\n  In order to better understand the issues presented in this case, we\nmust briefly review our country’s history of school desegregation liti-\ngation, in which CMS has played a prominent role.\n\n   Even after slavery had been abolished for almost a full century,\nAfrican-American children were, for the most part, either excluded\nfrom the public schools or educated separately from white children.\n\"In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some\nstates.\" Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 490 (1954) (\"Brown I\");\nsee also Martin v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 475 F. Supp.\n1319, 1324 (W.D.N.C. 1979) (\"For three centuries racial segregation\nwas the law of the land.\"). Indeed, throughout the early part of the\n1900s, CMS operated a segregated school system within the safe har-\nbor created by the Supreme Court’s doctrine of \"separate but equal\"\narticulated in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).\n\n   In the middle of the 1900s, the Supreme Court began dismantling\nthe great wall of segregation constructed under the imprimatur of\nPlessy. The Court initially sought to determine whether various \"sepa-\nrate\" African-American schools were genuinely \"equal\" to white\nschools by evaluating the quality of physical facilities, curricula, fac-\nulty, and certain \"intangible\" considerations. See, e.g., Sweatt v.\nPainter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of\n\f100    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nOkla., 332 U.S. 631 (1948). In each instance, the Court concluded\nthat they were not. Id.\n\n   In 1954, the Supreme Court at last overruled Plessy, declaring that\n\"in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’\nhas no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\"\nBrown I, 347 U.S. at 495. Just one year later, the Court mandated that\nfederal courts and school authorities take affirmative steps to achieve\ndesegregation. Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349 U.S 294, 299 (1955)\n(\"Brown II\"). Specifically, federal courts were to retain jurisdiction\nover desegregation cases during the period of transition, wielding\ntheir equitable powers to supervise school boards’ efforts to effectuate\nintegration. Id. at 300-01. One of the most important obligations of\nthe federal courts was to ensure that school boards were proceeding\nin good faith to desegregate the public schools \"with all deliberate\nspeed.\" Id. at 301. With these seminal decisions — Brown I and\nBrown II — the Supreme Court promised the citizens of this country,\nand particularly African-American children, school systems \"in which\nall vestiges of enforced racial segregation have been eliminated.\"\nWright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 463 (1972).\n\n   Notwithstanding the Court’s repeated admonition that segregation\nand its vestiges be eliminated \"root and branch,\" Green v. County Sch.\nBd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38 (1968), many school\nboards — CMS included — adopted \"an all too familiar\" response to\nthe mandate of Brown II, interpreting \"all deliberate speed\" \"as giving\nlatitude to delay steps to desegregate.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S.\n467, 472 (1992). And so, lower federal courts, with the guidance and\noversight of the Supreme Court, began fashioning equitable remedies\nto contend with school board recalcitrance. For example, in Green,\nthe Supreme Court held that a \"freedom of choice\" plan, which per-\nmitted students — regardless of race — to choose the school they\nwould attend, was by itself insufficient to meet the mandate of Brown.\n391 U.S. at 430. In so holding, the Court recognized that more inten-\nsive efforts would be necessary in order to make \"meaningful and\nimmediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segrega-\ntion.\" Id. at 439. Subsequently, in this very case, the Court approved\nsignificant federal court intervention into a school system in order to\neliminate segregation \"root and branch,\" including the busing of stu-\ndents from schools close to their homes to schools farther away, the\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     101\nuse of race-based \"mathematical ratios,\" and the alteration of student\nattendance zones. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402\nU.S. l, 15, 25, 28, 30-31 (1971).\n\n   The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that a federal court’s\n\"end purpose must be to remedy the violation and, in addition, to\nrestore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that\nis operating in compliance with the Constitution.\" Freeman, 503 U.S.\nat 489. Hence, as a school system eliminates the vestiges of past offi-\ncial segregation from certain facets of its operations, courts possess\nthe authority to relinquish supervision in a commensurate fashion. Id.\nat 489-91.\n\n   In this context, we examine the steps taken by CMS to eliminate\nthe vestiges of segregation.\n\n                                    B.\n\n                                     1.\n\n   North Carolina’s most significant initial response to the mandate of\nBrown II was the \"Pupil Assignment Act of 1955-56, under which\n[the Board had] the sole power to assign pupils to schools, and chil-\ndren [were] required to attend the schools to which they [were]\nassigned.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 300 F.\nSupp. 1358, 1361 (W.D.N.C. 1969). This was an ineffectual measure\n— perhaps intentionally so — and by 1964, no more than a few dozen\n(out of more than 20,000) African-American children in CMS were\nattending schools with white children. Id. at 1362.\n\n                                     2.\n\n   In 1965, the parents of African-American children attending CMS\n(hereinafter the \"Swann plaintiffs\")1 filed a class action seeking\ninjunctive relief, claiming that the Board’s policies and practices were\nperpetuating a segregated school system. Swann v. Charlotte-\n  1\n   Since this case was first filed in 1965, the various successor plaintiffs\nhave been referred to as the Swann plaintiffs, a practice we continue to\nobserve here.\n\f102     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 243 F. Supp. 667, 668 (W.D.N.C. 1965).\nOn July 14, 1965, the district court approved a Board-proposed plan\nthat closed certain black schools, built new schools, and established\nschool attendance zones based on neighborhoods. But the linchpin of\nthis plan was its grant of permission to each student — regardless of\nrace — to freely transfer to a different school (often described as a\n\"freedom of choice\" plan). Id. In approving this plan, the district court\nheld that CMS had no affirmative duty to \"increase the mixing of the\nraces\"; instead, the Board’s obligation under Brown II, according to\nthe court, was to act without the intent to perpetuate segregation. Id.\nat 670. The following year, this Court affirmed the district court’s\ninterpretation of Brown II. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 369 F.2d 29, 32 (4th Cir. 1966) (\"Whatever the Board may\ndo in response to its own initiative or that of the community, we have\nheld that there is no constitutional requirement that it act with the con-\nscious purpose of achieving the maximum mixture of the races in the\nschool population.\").\n\n   However, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 1968 decision in\nGreen, which struck down a desegregation plan founded predomi-\nnantly on \"freedom of choice,\" it became clear that school boards did\npossess an affirmative obligation to desegregate, not merely an obli-\ngation to implement race-neutral policies. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38.\nInvigorated by the developing law, the Swann plaintiffs promptly\nfiled a motion for further relief with the district court, seeking to\nexpedite the desegregation process.\n\n                                    3.\n\n  In 1969, Judge James B. McMillan, newly assigned to the Swann\ncase,2 reexamined the Board’s actions in light of Green and deter-\nmined that its \"freedom of choice\" plan, when coupled with geo-\ngraphic zoning, were \"not furthering desegregation.\" 300 F. Supp. at\n1372. On the fundamental matters of assigning students and faculty,\nand the siting of new schools, the court made the following findings:\n  2\n   For clarity’s sake, we will often refer within to the presiding district\njudge by name.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     103\n     • Student assignment: The court noted that a ratio of sev-\n       enty percent white students to thirty percent black stu-\n       dents, which approximated the ratio of white to black\n       students in the county, tended to aid \"better students [in\n       holding] their pace, with substantial improvement for the\n       poorer students.\" Id. at 1369.\n\n     • Faculty assignment: Although faculty members were not\n       being assigned with a discriminatory purpose, there was\n       also \"no sustained effort to desegregate faculties.\" Id. at\n       1370. The court ordered CMS to work actively to inte-\n       grate the faculties, so that \"a child attending any school\n       in the system will face about the same chances of having\n       a black or a white teacher as he would in any other\n       school.\" Id.\n\n     • School siting: The court underscored that the desirability\n       of implementing a \"neighborhood school\" policy, under\n       which efforts were made to locate schools in neighbor-\n       hoods and within walking distance for children, could\n       not override the constitutional duty to desegregate. Id. at\n       1369. At the same time, CMS was not to avoid locating\n       new facilities in black neighborhoods. Id. at 1371.\n\nIn light of Green, Judge McMillan also ordered CMS to submit a\nnew, amended desegregation plan, and he outlined certain possible\nremedies, including busing and re-zoning. Swann, 300 F. Supp. at\n1360; Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 306 F. Supp.\n1299, 1302 (W.D.N.C. 1969).\n\n   Once again, however, CMS was slow to respond, prompting Judge\nMcMillan to impose a deadline of August 4, 1969, by which the\nBoard was to submit a detailed desegregation plan to the court. See\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 300 F. Supp. 1381,\n1382, 1386 (W.D.N.C. 1969). CMS complied, and its proposed\ndesegregation plan appeared to accept, for the first time, the constitu-\ntional duty to desegregate students, teachers, principals, and staffs \"‘at\nthe earliest possible date.’\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 306 F. Supp. 1291, 1293 (W.D.N.C. 1969). The Board’s pro-\nposed desegregation plan, approved by the district court on an interim\n\f104      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nbasis (\"interim desegregation plan\"), included programs for faculty\ndesegregation, the closing of seven all-black schools, and the reas-\nsignment of pupils from the closed schools to outlying, predominantly\nwhite schools. Id. at 1298-99. In approving the plan on an interim\nbasis, the district court noted that black children were bearing a dis-\nproportionate burden of the desegregation efforts, but the court none-\ntheless concluded that some action — even if interim — was\npreferable to none at all. Id. at 1298. Judge McMillan also ordered the\nBoard to submit another desegregation plan within three months.\n\n   In November and December 1969, the district court determined\nthat the school system’s compliance with the interim desegregation\nplan was unsatisfactory, finding that the Board was continuing to per-\npetuate segregation:\n\n      The School Board is sharply divided in the expressed views\n      of its members. From the testimony of its members, and\n      from the latest report, it cannot be concluded that a majority\n      of its members have accepted the court’s orders as repre-\n      senting the law which applies to the local schools. By the\n      responses to the October 10 questions, the Board has indi-\n      cated that its members do not accept the duty to desegregate\n      the schools at any ascertainable time; and they have clearly\n      indicated that they intend not to do it effective in the fall of\n      1970. They have also demonstrated a yawning gap between\n      predictions and performance.\n\nSwann, 306 F. Supp. at 1306. At that time, the district court also\nreviewed and rejected the Board’s newly submitted amended desegre-\ngation plan. Id. at 1313-14. Then, the court appointed Dr. John A.\nFinger, Jr. as an expert consultant to prepare a more acceptable plan.\nThis appointment came nearly two years after the Supreme Court’s\nGreen decision and more than fifteen years after Brown I.\n\n   The district court ultimately adopted Dr. Finger’s proposed plan for\nelementary schools and the Board’s plan, as modified by Dr. Finger,\nfor secondary schools (collectively the \"Finger Plan\"). Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265, 268-70\n(W.D.N.C. 1970). In doing so, the court again observed the Board’s\nfailure to make an effective beginning to desegregation: \"The School\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     105\nBoard, after four opportunities and nearly ten months of time, have\nfailed to submit a lawful plan (one which desegregates all the\nschools). This default on their part leaves the court in the position of\nbeing forced to prepare or choose a lawful plan.\" Id. at 267.\n\n   The Finger Plan included several components. First, students were\nto be assigned \"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various\nschools at various grade levels have about the same proportion of\nblack and white students.\" Id. at 268. Second, \"no school [could] be\noperated with an all-black or predominantly black student body.\" Id.\nThird, in redrawing the school system’s attendance zones, the Board\nwas authorized to use bus transportation and noncontiguous \"satellite\nzones\"3 to accomplish its goals. Id. Fourth, the district court restricted\nthe student transfer policy in order to safeguard against resegregation.\nId. at 268-69. Fifth, the race of faculty members at each school had\nto approximate the ratio of black and white faculty members through-\nout the system. Id. at 268. Sixth, the overall competence of teachers\nat formerly black schools could not be inferior to those at formerly\nwhite schools. Id. Finally, the district court mandated that the Board\nmonitor and report on its progress in implementing the plan. Id. at\n269.\n\n   The Finger Plan was challenged on several occasions and, in 1971,\nthe Supreme Court upheld it as a valid exercise of the district court’s\nequitable powers. Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32. Indeed, the Court specif-\nically found that the district court’s adoption of a student assignment\nplan that used race-based \"mathematical ratios\" as a starting point was\nwell within the court’s \"equitable remedial discretion.\" Id. at 25.\n  3\n   CMS used \"satellite zones\" in connection with elementary schools.\nUnder this method, students from a small geographic area located outside\nan elementary school’s primary attendance area were assigned to that\nschool. J.A. 15571, 16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9 & n.3. The use\nof satellite zones was implemented by \"pairing\" elementary schools —\nstudents from a predominantly black neighborhood were bused to a\nschool in a predominantly white neighborhood for grades K-3, and stu-\ndents from a predominantly white neighborhood were bused to a school\nin a predominantly black neighborhood for grades 4-6. J.A. 15571,\n16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9-10.\n\f106    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   Even after the Supreme Court’s decision in Swann, the district\ncourt found that the Board’s desegregation efforts failed to meet con-\nstitutional requirements. For example, Judge McMillan ordered stu-\ndent assignment proposals revised in June 1971, finding that the\nproposals \"were discriminatory in detail and in overall result; they\nplaced increasing burdens upon black patrons while partially relieving\nwhite patrons of similar burdens.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nBd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346, 1347 (W.D.N.C. 1971). During the\n1971-72 and 1972-73 school years, the district court attempted a\n\"hands-off\" approach, leaving the Board to remedy problems as they\narose, but the court twice found that the Board still had not adopted\nsufficient measures to guard against resegregation and ensure that\nwhites were bearing an appropriate share of the desegregation burden.\nSee Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 362 F. Supp.\n1223, 1230 (W.D.N.C. 1973); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 379 F. Supp. 1102 (W.D.N.C. 1974); see also discussion of\nspecific findings infra.\n\n   The 1974 order expressed somewhat more optimism about the\nBoard’s desegregation efforts. In that order, Judge McMillan\napproved a student assignment proposal that, if implemented prop-\nerly, would result in \"a fair and stable school operation\" and would\npermit the court to close the case as an active matter. See 379 F. Supp.\nat 1103. The proposal made provisions for several \"optional schools\"\n— schools that would offer some specialized program or curriculum\nand thereby attract students of all races from across Charlotte and\nMecklenburg County. Although Judge McMillan approved the incor-\nporation of these schools into the plan, he cautioned that the optional\nschools would be inconsistent with the school board’s constitutional\nobligations if they merely served to re-institute \"freedom of choice.\"\nId. at 1104 (\"‘Freedom of choice’ was a synonym for segregation for\nmany years, and . . . it should not be resurrected at this late date sub\nnom. ‘optional schools’ without adequate safeguards against discrimi-\nnatory results.\"). To ensure that the optional schools served their\nstated purpose of furthering the process of desegregation, Judge\nMcMillan decreed that \"optional school enrollments will be con-\ntrolled starting with 1974 so that they . . . have about or above 20%\nblack students.\" Id.\n\n   Finally, in July 1975, over twenty years after the mandate of Brown\nII, Judge McMillan for the first time observed, albeit with reserva-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    107\ntions, that the Board was actually working toward desegregation:\n\"The new Board has taken a more positive attitude toward desegrega-\ntion and has at last openly supported affirmative action to cope with\nrecurrent racial problems in pupil assignment.\" Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 67 F.R.D. 648, 649 (W.D.N.C. 1975).\nAlthough the district court cautioned that problems remained, the new\nvigor with which the Board was pursuing desegregation persuaded\nJudge McMillan to close Swann as an active matter of litigation and\nto remove it from the court’s docket. Id. at 649-50. In so acting, the\ncourt reaffirmed that its orders still stood: \"[t]his case contains many\norders of continuing effect, and could be re-opened upon proper\nshowing that those orders are not being observed.\" Id. at 649.\n\n                                   4.\n\n  Between 1975 and 1992, two significant actions were taken in con-\nnection with the CMS desegregation litigation.\n\n                                   a.\n\n   First, in 1978, a group of white parents and children brought suit\nagainst CMS, seeking an order prohibiting the Board from assigning\nchildren pursuant to the Board’s latest student-assignment plan. See\nMartin, 475 F. Supp. at 1320. The Martin plaintiffs claimed that the\nSupreme Court’s then-recent decisions in Pasadena City Bd. of Educ.\nv. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 436 (1976), and University of Cal. Regents\nv. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 305 (1978), prohibited any consideration of\nrace in student assignment. 475 F. Supp. at 1321. The Swann plain-\ntiffs intervened in Martin, joining the Board’s opposition to the con-\ntentions of the Martin plaintiffs. Id.\n\n   A brief review of Spangler and Bakke is necessary to an under-\nstanding of Martin. In Spangler, the Supreme Court held that because\nthe Pasadena Unified School District (\"PUSD\") had achieved racial\nneutrality in its school attendance pattern, \"the District Court was not\nentitled to require the PUSD to rearrange its attendance zones each\nyear so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by the court was main-\ntained in perpetuity.\" 427 U.S. at 436. All parties in Spangler agreed\nthat the plan initially achieved racial neutrality in student attendance;\nnonetheless, the district court had believed it was empowered to annu-\n\f108      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\nally readjust school boundaries to ensure in perpetuity that there\nwould be no majority of any minority race at any Pasadena school.\nId. at 433, 436. In Bakke, the Supreme Court determined that a public\nuniversity with no history of discrimination could not constitutionally\nreserve sixteen out of one hundred admission slots for racial minori-\nties. 438 U.S. at 319-20. In striking down this admissions plan, the\nCourt had made clear that \"[w]hen a classification denies an individ-\nual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely because of his\nrace or ethnic background, [it must] be regarded as [constitutionally]\nsuspect.\" Id. at 305.\n\n   Judge McMillan, who retained jurisdiction over Swann and pre-\nsided over Martin, first held that because CMS had not achieved\nracial neutrality in student attendance, consideration of race in student\nassignment policies was appropriate under Swann. See Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 626 F.2d 1165 (4th Cir. 1980).\nHe explained that because the student assignment policy in the CMS\nschool system had been independently adopted by the Board, it was\nnot established, as the Spangler policy had been, via judicial coercion\nor order. 475 F. Supp. at 1340-43. Second, Judge McMillan ruled that\nBakke was inapposite to the claims of the Martin plaintiffs. Specifi-\ncally, the court reasoned that no child was being denied access to\nequal educational opportunity because of race, see id. at 1321, and the\nactions of the Board were therefore not constitutionally suspect under\nBakke.\n\n   In upholding the independent actions of the Board, Judge McMil-\nlan made several important findings. For example, he found that dis-\ncrimination had not ended; indeed, it was this very finding that led the\ncourt to uphold the 1978 race-conscious student assignment policy.\nId. at 1346-47. Also, although for the first time the district court\npraised the efforts of the Board without reservation, it underscored yet\nagain the need for patience and continued efforts:\n\n      It took three centuries to develop a slave culture, to fight a\n      bloody civil war, and to live through the century of racial\n      turmoil after that war.\n\n                                  ***\n\f        BELK v.

They need time to work their own\n     experiments, and to find their own ways of producing the\n     sustained operation of a system of schools in which racial\n     discrimination will play no part. I vote to uphold their\n     efforts to date, and to give them that time.\n\nId. at 1347. In 1980, we affirmed the district court’s decision in Mar-\ntin. See 626 F.2d at 1165.\n\n                                    b.\n\n   The second significant phase of litigation between 1975 and 1992\nwas initiated in 1980. At that time, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs\nnotified the district court that the black student population in CMS\nelementary schools had grown from twenty-nine percent to forty per-\ncent, making it increasingly difficult to comply with the desegregation\norder’s mandate to avoid majority-black elementary schools. In\nresponse to this change, Judge McMillan approved a modification to\nthe desegregation plan. Instead of prohibiting a \"predominantly black\nstudent body,\" the court permitted CMS to operate elementary\nschools with a black student population of \"plus 15 percent\" above\nthe district-wide average. Thus, if the school district averaged forty\npercent black students, any individual school could have fifty-five\npercent black students.\n\n                                    5.\n\n   From 1981 to 1992, the Board continued to operate its desegrega-\ntion plan as approved by the district court, focusing, inter alia, on sat-\nellite attendance zones, a feeder plan (assigning middle-school\nstudents from a certain neighborhood to identified high schools),\nschool closings, and construction of new schools. Then, in 1992,\nCMS substantially increased its reliance on \"optional\" or magnet\nschools (the \"expanded magnet schools program\"). The Board placed\nnew emphasis on magnet schools in order to phase out \"pairing\" and\nheavy reliance on busing, and to give parents more choice in school\n\f110     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nselection. It was the expanded magnet schools program that ultimately\nled to the present phase of this litigation.\n\n                                    6.\n\n   In September 1997, William Capacchione, individually and on\nbehalf of his daughter Cristina, sued CMS claiming that Cristina was\nunconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school. Christina is\nHispanic and Caucasian, and her suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 sought\ndeclaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. In response, CMS\nmoved to dismiss Capacchione’s suit and, almost simultaneously, the\nSwann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann, claiming that CMS was\nnot yet in compliance with past desegregation orders and had not yet\nachieved unitary status. Because Judge McMillan had died, the cases\nwere assigned to Senior Judge Robert D. Potter, who restored Swann\nto the district court’s docket, consolidated the cases, denied CMS’s\nmotion to dismiss, and granted Capacchione’s motion to intervene.4\n\n   The Capacchione plaintiffs claimed that CMS had long since elim-\ninated the vestiges of segregation in its schools, and that its formerly\ndual system of white and black schools had, for some time, been uni-\ntary. They also contended that CMS, while still operating under the\ncourt’s desegregation orders, had violated those orders and the consti-\ntutional rights of white students in its efforts to desegregate the school\nsystem by employing a race-conscious assignment lottery in its\nexpanded magnet schools program. The Swann plaintiffs countered\nthat the school system had not yet achieved unitary status. CMS\nacknowledged that it was not yet in compliance with past desegrega-\ntion orders and agreed that it should not be declared to have achieved\n  4\n   Since filing suit, the Capacchiones have moved to California. Based\non that fact and other findings, the district court determined that William\nCapacchione no longer possessed standing to seek injunctive or declara-\ntory relief, but that he did have standing to pursue compensatory relief.\nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schs., 57 F. Supp. 2d 228, 240\n(W.D.N.C. 1999). Another group of white parents intervened in the con-\nsolidated action and that group, represented by plaintiff Michael Grant,\nclaimed that CMS has achieved unitary status. The various groups of\nplaintiffs that have joined in Capacchione’s claims are hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the Capacchione plaintiffs.\"\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     111\nunitary status. CMS also contended that, in any event, the expanded\nmagnet schools program constituted an entirely constitutional and\nappropriate integration tool authorized under the desegregation orders\nin this case. The Swann plaintiffs, while endorsing the concept of\nmagnet schools, argued that the expanded magnet schools program,\nas implemented, was contributing to the resegregation of the school\nsystem.\n\n   Following a bench trial conducted from April 19 to June 22, 1999,\nthe court, on September 9, 1999, filed its Memorandum of Decision\nand Order, from which this appeal is taken. See Capacchione v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schs., 57 F. Supp. 2d 228 (W.D.N.C. 1999).\nAlthough the Board claimed that unitary status had not been achieved,\nthe district court found that it had. In its ruling, the district court then\nfound that the Board’s expanded magnet schools program, even\nthough instituted to effect court-ordered desegregation, was unconsti-\ntutional. Furthermore, the court enjoined the Board from \"assigning\nchildren to schools or allocating educational opportunities and bene-\nfits through race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other\nmeans that deny students an equal footing based on race.\" Id. at 294.\nFinally, the court awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs nominal mone-\ntary damages and substantial attorney’s fees.\n\n                                    C.\n\n   The Board and Swann plaintiffs appealed every portion of the dis-\ntrict court’s judgment. A panel of this Court, with one judge dissent-\ning, vacated and remanded the district court’s unitary status\ndetermination, holding that the district court’s unitary status findings\nwere insufficient with respect to student assignment, facilities, trans-\nportation, and student achievement. The panel also reversed the dis-\ntrict court’s holding that the expanded magnet schools program\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause, reasoning that the program com-\nplied in all respects with court orders governing the case and did not\nin any way violate the Constitution. Finally, the panel vacated the dis-\ntrict court’s injunction, the award of nominal damages, and the award\nof attorney fees. See Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 233\nF.3d 232 (4th Cir. 2000). Thereafter, on January 17, 2001, a majority\nof the active members of the Court voted to hear this case en banc.\n\f112     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                                   II.\n\n   We first address the district court’s unitary status decision. The\ndetermination of whether any part of a school system has achieved\nunitary status is a factual one; therefore, the district court’s findings\nas to unitary status are reviewed for clear error. See Riddick v. School\nBd. of the City of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521, 533 (4th Cir. 1986); see also\nJacksonville Branch, NAACP v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 883 F.2d\n945, 952 n.3 (11th Cir. 1989) (citing United States v. Texas Educ.\nAgency, 647 F.2d 504, 506 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981)). No deference,\nhowever, is owed to the district court on conclusions of law, including\nthe district court’s understanding of controlling law or the various\nburdens of proof and presumptions; consequently, all such conclu-\nsions of law are reviewed de novo. See, e.g., In re Brice, 188 F.3d\n576, 577 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                   A.\n\n                                   1.\n\n   Indisputably, the school system of Charlotte-Mecklenburg County\nsubjected African-Americans to nearly a century of segregation and\ndiscrimination. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized as much in\nSwann, noting that North Carolina was one of the states with \"a long\nhistory of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system\ndeliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate\npupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\" 402 U.S. at 5-6. In this\ncontext the remedies forcefully endorsed in Brown II, including the\nuse of race-conscious measures, are necessary to eradicate the invidi-\nous segregation at which they are aimed.\n\n   Moreover, court supervision over local school boards, also\nembraced in Brown and its progeny, is entirely appropriate whenever\n\"school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations\" \"to take what-\never steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination would be eliminated.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 15.\nNot only are the federal courts entitled to supervise and direct the\nactions of local school boards under those circumstances, but the\nscope of federal authority is almost plenary: \"Once a right and a vio-\nlation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable pow-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD            OF   EDUCATION     113\ners to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are\ninherent in equitable remedies.\" Id. There is no doubt that CMS was\njustifiably subjected to federal court supervision; in fact, even after\nthe Board had been subjected to court supervision, it had to be repeat-\nedly ordered to begin the process of desegregation.\n\n   Ultimately, however, the goal in a desegregation case such as this\nis to reach the point at which federal supervision is no longer war-\nranted and the use of race-conscious measures is no longer necessary.\nSee Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489. The Supreme Court has identified six\nfactors (collectively the \"original Green factors\") that must be free\nfrom racial discrimination before the mandate of Brown is met: (1)\nstudent assignment, (2) physical facilities, (3) transportation, (4) fac-\nulty, (5) staff, and (6) extracurricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at\n435. Not only are reviewing courts to ascertain whether these original\nGreen factors are free from racial discrimination, but courts also are\nentitled, in their discretion, to identify other factors (\"ancillary factors\")5\nand \"determine whether minority students were being disadvantaged\nin ways that required the formulation of new and further remedies to\nensure full compliance with the court’s decree.\" 503 U.S. at 492.\n\n                                      2.\n\n   For school systems proceeding through the difficult process of\ndesegregation, the Supreme Court has adopted the goal of achieving\nunitary status. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 486-87; Board of Educ. of Okla.\nCity v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 245-46 (1991). Although prior to the\nCourt’s Dowell and Freeman decisions federal courts used the term\n\"unitary status\" somewhat inconsistently, see Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n486-87; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, the term has now come to mean\nthat the school system has been unified such that the vestiges of seg-\nregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 487; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38. When a school system\nachieves unitary status, federal courts must withdraw supervision over\nthe local school board.\n  5\n   For convenience, we refer to the original Green factors and any ancil-\nlary factors identified by the district court as \"Green factors.\"\n\f114     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   In this case, Judge Potter declared that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus in every respect. The Supreme Court has directed that an appel-\nlate court review a district court’s unitary status determination by\napplying a two-part inquiry (the \"Freeman inquiries\"). An appellate\ncourt must determine if (1) a school Board has, in good faith, com-\nplied with the desegregation decree since it was entered; and (2) the\nvestiges of de jure segregation in the school system have been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50).\n\n   If the party seeking a declaration of unitary status cannot demon-\nstrate that the school system has achieved unitary status in its entirety,\nwe then undertake to determine whether the school system has\nachieved unitary status with respect to one or some of the Green fac-\ntors (\"partial unitary status\"). At that point, we apply, with respect to\neach Green factor, the two Freeman inquiries along with one addi-\ntional Freeman-mandated inquiry: \"whether retention of judicial con-\ntrol [over one aspect of the school system] is necessary or practicable\nto achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school\nsystem.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491. This third Freeman inquiry rec-\nognizes that the Green factors are — to a great extent — interrelated,\nand when determining whether judicial supervision over a school\nboard may be withdrawn, the overlap between the Green factors is a\ncrucial consideration.\n\n    The Freeman analysis brings us to the most difficult questions\npresented in any desegregation case: whether present racial isolation\nis a vestige of past segregation and, if so, whether a school board can\npracticably reduce that racial isolation. It is even difficult to define\n\"vestige\" in this context. See id. at 502 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"We\nhave never sought to describe how one identifies . . . a ‘vestige’ or\na ‘remnant’ of past discrimination. . . .\"). The vestiges \"that are the\nconcern of the law may be subtle and intangible but nonetheless they\nmust be so real that they have a causal link to the de jure violation\nbeing remedied.\" Id. at 496 (Kennedy, J.); see also id. at 512 (Souter,\nJ., concurring) (citing Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449,\n465 & n.13 (1979) and Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, 413 U.S.\n189, 211 & n.17 (1973)) (court must order affirmative remedy where\nschool board’s conduct \"create[d] or contribute[d] to\" racial identifia-\nbility of schools). We adhere to the most common-sense meaning of\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    115\n\"vestige\": it is a condition or occurrence causally related to the former\nde jure system of segregation.\n\n   Because a school system’s duty to eliminate such vestiges is\nrestricted by the availability of practicable measures for doing so, see\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492, it is also incumbent on us to consider prac-\nticability. In determining the practicability of further measures, the\ndistrict court must look to numerous indicia of the system’s operation.\nPracticability depends on the feasibility of the proposed method, from\nboth a financial and an administrative perspective. Cf. id. at 481-83,\n493-97. Whether a measure is practicable also depends on whether it\nis \"directed to curing the effects of the specific violation,\" and\nwhether it is likely to do so. Id. at 497.\n\n   Our duty, in reviewing Judge Potter’s decision, see Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 228, is clear. We must examine each Green factor\nand ascertain whether unitary status has been achieved with respect\nto any or all of them. Because the district court declared the entire\nCMS school system to have achieved unitary status, we must assess,\nwith respect to each Green factor, whether the Board has complied,\nin good faith, with the desegregation decree and whether the vestiges\nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50). If the\nschool system has not achieved unitary status in its entirety, then,\nconsistent with Freeman, we also must weigh the degree of interre-\nlatedness existing between the various Green factors.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   By way of introduction to our analysis of this case, we first address\na fundamental flaw in the district court’s proceedings — a flaw aris-\ning from the district court’s failure to give any consideration to a\nremedial plan sought to be admitted as evidence by CMS. Following\nthe filing of the Capacchione plaintiffs’ Complaint in Intervention,\nthe Board undertook to produce a comprehensive analysis of whether\nvestiges of de jure segregation existed in CMS and whether any such\nvestiges could be practicably remedied. The Board analyzed available\ndata and identified several vestiges remaining; then, in line with the\nmandate of Freeman, the Superintendent of CMS developed a plan\ncontaining practicable remedial steps. The Board independently\n\f116     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nreviewed this plan and, on March 30, 1999, adopted the \"Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Schools’ Remedial Plan to Address the Remaining Ves-\ntiges of Segregation\" (the \"Plan\" or \"Remedial Plan\"). J.A. 11029.\n\n   Consistent with pretrial deadlines, CMS filed the Remedial Plan\nwith the district court as a potential exhibit at trial. J.A. 11028. At the\npretrial conference conducted on April 13, 1999, the Capacchione\nplaintiffs moved in limine to exclude the Remedial Plan. In essence,\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs maintained that the trial had been bifur-\ncated into two phases and that only unitary status was at issue in the\nfirst phase. They further maintained that the Remedial Plan contained\nproposed remedies that could only be implemented if CMS was deter-\nmined not to have achieved unitary status. Because the unitary status\nquestion had not yet been resolved, they claimed that the Remedial\nPlan (which the Capacchione plaintiffs characterized as a damages\nreport) was irrelevant.\n\n   In opposing exclusion of the Remedial Plan, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs relied on the Supreme Court’s Freeman analysis. J.A. 1421.\nSpecifically, they asserted that each unitary status determination\nencompassed in the first phase of the trial turned on \"whether the ves-\ntiges have been remedied to the extent practicable.\" Id. (emphasis\nadded). The Remedial Plan, they claimed, was not merely relevant,\nbut crucial, to establishing both the existence of vestiges of segrega-\ntion and the practicability of remedial measures.\n\n    Judge Potter responded with two rulings. First, Judge Potter\nexplained in assessing whether CMS had achieved unitary status that\nhe believed Freeman required him to consider just one thing: \"only\n. . . what CMS has done, not what it may do in the future.\" See Order\nof April 14, 1999 at 4. Second, based on this understanding of Free-\nman and the unitary status test, Judge Potter concluded that the Reme-\ndial Plan was irrelevant: \"If the Court later determines that additional\nremedial measures are needed, it may consider the plan. Until that\ntime comes, however, the Court will not get mired in the complex\ndetails and mechanics of a proposed plan.\" Id. at 5.6\n  6\n   Judge Potter also chided CMS for proffering the Remedial Plan \"after\nthe deadline for fact discovery and expert witness discovery had\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     117\n  We believe Judge Potter erred in both of these rulings. First, he\nmisapprehended Freeman and its test for unitary status. At the outset,\nFreeman explicitly rejects, as a matter of law, the very analysis\nadopted by the district court. That is, under Freeman, a district court\nmust consider (1) compliance with prior orders (i.e., \"what CMS has\ndone\"), and (2) whether vestiges have been eliminated to the extent\npracticable (i.e., \"what [CMS] may do in the future\"). See Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 491; see also Order of April 14, 1999 at 4. By construing\nFreeman’s unitary status test to include the former (\"what CMS has\ndone\") but not the latter (\"what [CMS] may do in the future\"), Judge\nPotter erred as a matter of law.\n\n   The Remedial Plan directly addresses the latter inquiry, and it does\nso in an apt, informed manner, relying on the considered opinions of\nhighly capable professionals retained to analyze the latest available\ndata. In other words, the district court’s second reason for excluding\nthe Plan — relevancy — also fails to withstand scrutiny.7 There is no\n\nexpired.\" On the contrary, CMS fulfilled all of its duties under the fed-\neral rules, appropriately supplementing its responses to discovery\nrequests as soon as the Remedial Plan had been adopted. Furthermore,\na more precipitant proposal could not have incorporated the various\nexpert perspectives developed during discovery. A similar plan submit-\nted earlier in the course of the litigation necessarily would have been\nbased largely on speculation and supposition, and therefore would have\nbeen far less useful and pertinent. As it was, the Plan was tendered in\nadvance of the non-jury trial, and, of great significance, almost five\nmonths before the district court issued its decision. Neither the court nor\nthe parties could have been inconvenienced by the necessary timing of\nthe Remedial Plan’s submission.\n   7\n     Taking the district court at its word that the only question before it\ninitially was the extent of the Board’s compliance with the prior desegre-\ngation orders, the Remedial Plan was nonetheless highly relevant for\neven that purpose. The ease with which some of the proposed Plan reme-\ndies could be realized, e.g., merely distributing available funding to\naddress the stark disparity in basic resources such as instructional materi-\nals and media centers, see J.A. 11040, strongly suggests that the Board\nhad not fully implemented the long-standing dictates of the prior orders.\nThe court nonetheless observed that \"while the goal of perfect compli-\nance with court orders has remained elusive, no evidence has been pre-\n\f118     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\ndoubt that Judge Potter had wide discretion on this issue, but rele-\nvancy is a fluid concept under the Federal Rules of Evidence. See\nFed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any ten-\ndency to make the existence\" of any material fact \"more probable or\nless probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Consequently,\nrelevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. See,\ne.g., United States v. Van Metre, 150 F.3d 339, 349 (4th Cir. 1998)\n(citing United States v. Powers, 59 F.3d 1460, 1465 (4th Cir. 1995)).\n\n   However, we need not rely on the minimal threshold encompassed\nin the test for relevancy because this Remedial Plan would be relevant\nunder any reasonable test. The Remedial Plan identified record evi-\ndence (including the deposition testimony of several experts) support-\ning the Board’s belief that vestiges of de jure segregation in CMS\nremain apparent in (1) faculty assignment and quality, (2) physical\nfacilities and the allocation of instructional resources, (3) student\nachievement, and (4) student assignment. More importantly, the\nRemedial Plan detailed specific steps that the Board proposed to\nundertake over the course of the ensuing five years \"with a goal of\nachieving unitary status at that time.\" J.A. 11029.\n\n   Without a doubt, federal courts possess the final word in deciding\nwhether a particular school system is operating within the parameters\nof the Constitution. Appreciable weight must be given, however, to\nthe views of those selected by the community to administer the sys-\ntem. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248 (noting specialized knowledge pos-\nsessed by local school officials).8 In refusing to consider the Plan, the\n\nsented that school authorities were guilty of easily correctable errors.\"\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 283. To the contrary, the Plan thoroughly\ndocumented the Board’s failings and the facility with which they could\nbe rectified. The district court simply chose to ignore this highly relevant\nevidence.\n   8\n     Though we need not grant CMS the same deference afforded the pro-\nmulgations and adjudications of a federal administrative agency, the for-\nmal declarations of its governing Board \"do constitute a body of\nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may\nproperly resort for guidance.\" Ritter v. Cecil County Office of Housing\n& Community Dev., 33 F.3d 323, 328 (4th Cir. 1994) (quoting Skidmore\nv. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)).\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    119\ndistrict court erroneously failed to accord the Board’s official position\nany weight, much less the respect that it was due.\n\n   That the district court so completely disregarded this crucial evi-\ndence is telling. Nonetheless, ever mindful of the deference accorded\nthe factfinder, we embark upon the task of examining the court’s con-\nclusions.\n\n                        1. Student assignment\n\n   Of all the Green factors, the most prominent is the degree of racial\nimbalance in student assignment. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474. Unifor-\nmity in the racial composition of a given school was the hallmark of\nofficial discrimination, \"for under the former de jure regimes racial\nexclusion was both the means and the end of a policy motivated by\ndisparagement of, or hostility towards, the disfavored race.\" Id. Court-\nordered desegregation was designed to meet the enemy head-on; the\nlong-term stability of attempts at racial balancing in student assign-\nment is often seen as the most conspicuous indication of the courts’\nsuccess (or lack thereof) in combating the underlying societal evil.\n\n   The fundamental questions before us are whether present racial iso-\nlation in CMS may be a vestige of the former dual system, and, if so,\nwhether there are practicable measures CMS could take to reduce or\neliminate that isolation. In considering these questions, we are bound\nto focus particularly on the Board’s record of compliance with the\ndistrict court’s desegregation orders. See id. at 492 (citing Dowell).\nBecause significant and growing racial imbalances in student assign-\nment do exist in CMS, because the Board for decades has failed to\ncomply with certain specific decrees of the district court (particularly\nregarding the siting of new schools), because these failures may have\ncontributed to current racial isolation, and because future compliance\nmight practicably reduce this racial isolation, we would vacate the\ndistrict court’s finding that CMS has achieved unitary status with\nrespect to student assignment.\n\n                                   a.\n\n  In the wake of the 1970 desegregation order, virtually all of the\n\f120     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nschools in CMS operated in racial balance for a considerable time. By\n1998-99 however, nearly thirty percent of the schools in the system\nhad become racially identifiable.9 Of the 126 schools included in the\nCMS desegregation plan, twenty-three are identifiably black and thir-\nteen more are identifiably white. J.A. 11587. Further, virtually all of\nthe identifiably black schools are located in either the inner city or in\nthe immediate northwest-to-northeast suburbs, the areas of Mecklen-\nburg County with the highest concentration of African-Americans. In\nstark contrast, all thirteen of the identifiably white schools are found\nin the extreme northern and southern areas of the county, both of\nwhich (and particularly the latter) have seen dramatic increases in\nwhite population during the past thirty years. The trend in CMS\ntoward resegregation of its schools has accelerated markedly since the\nmove to de-emphasize satellite zones and mandatory busing in 1992.\nIn the last seven years, the number of CMS African-American stu-\ndents who attend racially identifiable schools (now almost three in\nten) has risen fifty percent. J.A. 9589.\n\n   Indisputably, from 1981 until 1997, the CMS school system went\nthrough significant demographic changes. For example, the total pop-\nulation of Mecklenburg County has grown from 354,656 in 1970 to\n613,310 in 1997. J.A. 16247. Almost 100,000 children attend CMS,\nmaking it the twenty-third largest school system in the country. J.A.\n7107. During the period from 1970 to 1997, the black school-age pop-\nulation (ages 5 through 17) in the county has increased by approxi-\nmately 10,000. J.A. 16247. Over the same period, the corresponding\nwhite school-age population has decreased by approximately 3,000,\nid., and by 1997, African-Americans comprised 34 percent of the\ncounty’s school-age population, the total of which numbered approxi-\nmately 108,600. Evidence before the district court revealed that, since\n1970, the growing African-American population has migrated out-\nward from the inner city into formerly white suburbs. In turn, many\n  9\n   Judge McMillan’s final desegregation order mandated, inter alia, that\nno school should become \"racially identifiable.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at\n268. Judge Potter interpreted the phrase synonymously with \"racially\nimbalanced,\" which, as noted within, describes a school with an African-\nAmerican student population deviating more than fifteen points in either\ndirection from the county-wide norm. See Cappachione, 57 F. Supp. 2d\nat 246.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     121\nwhite citizens who formerly populated the city’s periphery have\nmoved even farther into the county’s outlying reaches. Though parts\nof the county have become more integrated as the result of these\nshifts, a disproportionately large number of African-Americans still\nreside in contiguous clusters generally north and west of the down-\ntown area.\n\n   The threshold issue to be addressed is whether the thirty-six\nracially identifiable schools in CMS represent a vestige of segregation\n— that is, whether the present racial isolation is causally related to the\nprior system of de jure segregation. The Swann plaintiffs argue, and\nCMS agrees, that current racial isolation, like the racial isolation of\nthe 1960s and 1970s, results both from past inequities that, to some\nextent, have persisted to this day, and from the Board’s failure to\ncomply with certain specific directives in the remedial decrees in this\ncase.\n\n   Because CMS has not previously been adjudged to have achieved\nunitary status in student assignment, we are bound under Swann to\npresume that the current racial imbalance in the school population\nconstitutes a continuing vestige of segregation. 402 U.S. at 26. The\nCapacchione plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the present\nexistence of predominantly one-race schools in CMS \"is not the result\nof present or past discriminatory action.\" Id.; see also Riddick, 784\nF.2d at 535.\n\n   Our unwillingness to conclude that CMS is unitary with respect to\nstudent assignment centers on the Board’s failure to comply with\ncourt orders regarding selection of sites for the construction of new\nschools. The role of school siting in achieving sustainable desegrega-\ntion should not be underestimated. In fact, the importance of site\nselection has been apparent since the early stages of this case. As the\nSupreme Court explained in 1971:\n\n     In the past [site selection] choices . . . have been used as a\n     potent weapon for creating or maintaining a state-segregated\n     school system. . . . [S]chool authorities have sometimes,\n     since Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to\n     become racially mixed through changes in neighborhood\n     residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied by\n\f122      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n       building new schools in the areas of white suburban expan-\n       sion farthest from Negro population centers in order to\n       maintain the separation of the races with a minimum depar-\n       ture from the formal principles of \"neighborhood zoning.\"\n       Such a policy does more than simply influence the short-run\n       composition of the student body of a new school. It may\n       well promote segregated residential patterns which, when\n       combined with \"neighborhood zoning,\" further lock the\n       school system into the mold of separation of the races. . . .\n       In ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school seg-\n       regation, the existence of a pattern of school construction\n       and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight.\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 21.\n\n   Subsequent to the Supreme Court’s decision in Swann, Judge\nMcMillan specifically ordered that site selection for new schools\ncould not \"be predicated on population trends alone.\" 379 F. Supp. at\n1107. New schools were \"to be built where they can readily serve\nboth races.\" Id. In the 1979 Martin decision,10 Judge McMillan\ndevoted an entire section of his opinion to demonstrating that \"con-\nstruction, location and closing of school buildings continue to pro-\nmote segregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1329. Judge McMillan explained\nthat \"[t]he location of schools plays a large if not determinative role\nin . . . insuring that any given assignment and feeder plan will provide\nmeaningful desegregation, rather than just the predictably short lived\nappearance of desegregation.\" Id. at 1332.\n\n   In the years since this decree was issued, CMS has built twenty-\nfive of twenty-seven new schools in predominantly white suburban\ncommunities. In the mid-1980s, CMS adopted a formal policy of\n  10\n    Judge Potter incorrectly declared that \"Martin was not a unitary sta-\ntus hearing[.]\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250. In fact, as the accom-\npanying text indicates, the white parents in Martin contended, as the\nCapacchione plaintiffs do today, that CMS had achieved unitary status.\nIntervening African-American parents, like those herein, maintained to\nthe contrary. In actuality, there is little difference between today’s case\nand Martin, and Judge McMillan’s findings in the latter are as binding\non the parties as any others made in the course of this litigation.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    123\nbuilding \"midpoint\" schools — schools located midway between\nblack and white population centers. There is little evidence, however,\nto suggest that CMS faithfully adhered to this policy. Rather, record\nevidence strongly indicates that the policy influenced the site selec-\ntion for, at most, four of the twenty-seven new schools. See J.A.\n15404-06. Meanwhile, as we discuss infra, there is substantial evi-\ndence that CMS has allowed many of its older school facilities in the\ncity — schools attended in disproportionate numbers by African-\nAmerican students — to fall into a state of disrepair.\n\n   The Board’s record of building the great majority of its new\nschools on the predominantly white suburban fringe of the county\nsupports two possible conclusions. On one hand, CMS could have\nbeen responding to demographic reality — a demand for new class-\nrooms in areas of high population growth (although we note that the\nnumber of white students in CMS has decreased since 1970, while the\nblack student population has greatly increased). On the other hand,\nthe Board’s pattern of school construction could have facilitated or\neven hastened white flight to the suburbs. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Swann, \"[p]eople gravitate toward school facilities, just\nas schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location\nof schools may thus influence the patterns of residential development\nof a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of\ninner-city neighborhoods.\" 402 U.S. at 20-21. The Board’s school sit-\ning policies could well evidence its lack of political will in the face\nof pressure to abandon desegregative policies — pressure from fami-\nlies who \"are concerned about the racial composition of a prospective\nschool and [who] will make residential decisions accordingly.\" Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 513 (Blackmun, J., concurring).\n\n   There is certainly no evidence that CMS has intentionally sought,\nthrough its school siting policies, to \"lock the school system into the\nmold of separation of the races\" in the way that the Supreme Court\ndescribed in Swann, 402 U.S. at 21. But the actual choices the Board\nhas made with regard to school siting may in fact be quite similar to\nthe \"pattern of school construction and abandonment\" described by\nthe Court, with the actual effect that the Court feared of \"lock[ing] the\nschool system\" into a condition of racial isolation. 402 U.S. at 21. We\ncannot conclude, at least in the absence of further fact-finding, that\nCMS, in choosing sites for new schools, has pursued \"meaningful\n\f124     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\ndesegregation, rather than just the predictably short lived appearance\nof desegregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1332.\n\n   Rather, the Board’s practice of siting new schools such that they\ncould not reasonably be expected to serve a racially balanced student\npopulation and Judge McMillan’s determination that this practice, in\nthe past, represented the school system’s failure to eliminate the ves-\ntiges of segregation, together raise a strong inference that those ves-\ntiges remain today. When this inference is viewed in combination\nwith the burden borne by the Capacchione plaintiffs to show that cur-\nrent racial imbalances have no causal link to past discrimination, we\nare compelled to conclude that a remand to the district court is\nrequired.\n\n   Although we defer to a district court’s findings of fact unless\nclearly erroneous, Judge Potter’s error here came in his application of\nthe legal standard to the evidence regarding the Board’s school siting\npolicies. Judge Potter found that (1) CMS had not discriminated on\nthe basis of race in choosing sites for new schools and that (2) CMS\nhad incorporated racial diversity as one of its factors in site selection.\nEven assuming arguendo that both findings are not clearly erroneous,\nneither is sufficient to support the legal conclusion that in siting new\nschools CMS acted in compliance with the governing court orders and\nConstitution to eliminate the vestiges of segregation to the extent\npracticable.\n\n   \"To fulfill this duty, school officials are obligated not only to avoid\nany official action that has the effect of perpetuating or reestablishing\na dual school system, but also to render decisions that further desegre-\ngation and help to eliminate the effects of the previous dual school\nsystem.\" Harris v. Crenshaw County Bd. of Educ., 968 F.2d 1090,\n1095 (11th Cir. 1992) (citing Pitts v. Freeman, 755 F.2d 1423, 1427\n(11th Cir. 1985)). Therefore, CMS had to do more than merely select\nsites for new schools on a nondiscriminatory basis. It had to do more,\ntoo, than simply give some consideration to \"diversity\" in its selection\nof sites. To the extent practicable, CMS had to site new schools\n\"where they can readily serve both races.\" 379 F. Supp. at 1107; see\nalso Swann, 402 U.S. at 21; Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1329-32. Judge\nPotter never found that CMS had met this standard, and as outlined\nwithin, there is substantial record evidence that CMS did not do so.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    125\n   In accordance with Swann, the burden is on the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs to prove that vestiges of past discrimination do not remain, or\nthat nothing can practicably be done to remedy them. We note that\nJudge McMillan, in his last published decision in this case, clearly\nevidenced his understanding both that CMS had not done all that it\ncould do in the area of school siting and that future school siting deci-\nsions could practicably advance the process of desegregation. It was\nthus incumbent on the Capacchione plaintiffs to demonstrate that\nconditions in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County have changed suffi-\nciently such that school siting no longer represents a practicable\nopportunity to eliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs have identified additional areas in which\nCMS has fallen short of its obligations under the court orders. For the\nlife of the desegregation orders, CMS has consistently placed the\nheaviest burden of mandatory busing on African-American students.\nCurrently, 80% of those students who ride the bus as a result of a\nmandatory assignment are African-American. J.A. 11515. Judge\nMcMillan repeatedly ordered CMS to distribute this burden more\nfairly. See 475 F. Supp. at 1339-40; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362 F.\nSupp. at 1232-33. Yet, CMS has utterly failed to do so. In addition,\nCMS has never developed an effective system for monitoring student\ntransfers to ensure that the overall effect of such transfers is not to\nincrease the racial imbalance in the system as a whole. Again, this\nrepresents a failure to comply with the explicit instructions of the dis-\ntrict court. See 475 F. Supp. at 1337-38; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362\nF. Supp. at 1229-30. We are troubled by these failings on the part of\nCMS. They provide additional support for a conclusion that, in the\nface of political pressure, CMS has not done all that it could do to\neliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\n   Finally, the Board has itself taken the remarkable step of admitting\nits noncompliance with prior orders in this case. A school board’s\nfrank acquiescence in a position inuring to its detriment (in this case,\nthe potential of ongoing judicial intervention), if not treated as con-\nclusive, should at least be considered with the utmost gravity. Under\nthese circumstances, we have no difficulty in determining that the dis-\ntrict court’s conclusion that the Board’s level of compliance was \"full\nand satisfactory\" should be vacated.\n\f126     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                                    b.\n\n   If the vestiges of official discrimination have indeed been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable with respect to student assignment,\nthen there is little reason to prolong court supervision. In light of the\ndistrict court’s failure, however, to recognize the Board’s continuing\nnoncompliance with respect to student assignment — administered as\nrecently as twenty years ago in a manner reinforcing the once-official\nnotion that African-Americans are inferior — we have no confidence\nin the court’s ultimate finding that these vestiges have now disap-\npeared.\n\n   The district court neglected to determine whether, since Judge\nMcMillan’s decision in Martin, CMS has fulfilled its constitutional\nand court-imposed obligations with regard to site selection for new\nschools. Had the Board’s efforts been deemed lacking, the court\nbelow should have proceeded to decide whether this failure contrib-\nuted to the present condition of racial isolation in the school system.\nIf the district court then found that CMS had failed to live up to its\nconstitutional and judicially decreed obligations, and if that failure did\ncontribute to the present racial imbalances, then the court was bound\nto further investigate whether proper site selection is a practicable\nremedy for the lingering effects of the Board’s past discriminatory\npractices. Only if proper site selection were not a viable option could\nthe district court have relinquished control over student assignment;\nthere would be nothing further that CMS could practicably do to elim-\ninate the vestiges of the prior de jure system.\n\n   If, however, proper sites were found to be available, then student\nassignment should have remained under the district court’s control. In\nfashioning a remedy, the court might have directed, for example, that\nmost or all new schools constructed over the next several years be\nlocated proximate to the inner city or in midpoint areas already inte-\ngrated residentially. Conversely, the district court might have con-\ncluded that more flexibility is required because of real estate costs,\ncrushing demand in the suburban fringes, or for some other sufficient\nreason. In this vein, the Board’s Remedial Plan could have been con-\nsidered as a limited term remedy for the racial isolation that would\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     127\notherwise continue to exist until the Board’s newly redirected school\nsiting policies can begin to take effect.11\n\n   Should corrective action one day be deemed justified in this case,\nsome reasons will not be sufficient to deny African-American stu-\ndents a remedy. For example, political pressure and perceived resis-\ntance to change by certain groups in the community will not suffice.\nAdditionally, logistical barriers merely making \"difficult\" the trans-\nport inward of outlying white students will likewise, if reasonably\nsurmountable, not be enough. Cf. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253\n(district court’s observation that \"transport[ing] white students in\nfrom satellite zones . . . is difficult given the rush hour traffic pat-\nterns\"). Although what is \"practicable\" need not extend to all that is\n\"possible,\" rectifying the grievous constitutional wrongs of the past\nsurely justifies reaching beyond the \"difficult\" or purely \"problem-\natic.\"\n\n                         2. Physical Facilities\n\n   After describing how CMS has allocated its physical facilities and\nresources among its students, Judge Potter concluded that \"the Swann\nplaintiffs have failed to overcome the Court’s previous findings on\nfacilities by establishing the requisite discriminatory intent and causa-\ntion.\" Id. at 267. Judge Potter’s mention of \"previous findings\" refers\nto excerpts from various opinions and orders authored by Judge\nMcMillan:\n  11\n     The strategies described in the Remedial Plan would be of particular\nhelp in deciding whether practicable measures are available. The Plan\nproposes, among other things, to divide Mecklenburg County into three\nto five demographically similar \"clusters,\" within which students may\nchoose to attend any school, magnet or otherwise. Where the demand for\na given school exceeds the available room, spots would be assigned by\nlottery based on factors such as proximity, sibling attendance, and racial,\nethnic, and economic diversity. The Plan also outlines a formal mecha-\nnism to disseminate information regarding the enrollment process, and it\nprovides that the Board will work with the business community and local\ngovernment to secure subsidies for disadvantaged families wishing to\nrelocate to areas in which low-cost housing is scarce. See J.A. 11053-59.\n\f128      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n      April 1969 - \"No racial discrimination or inequality is\n      found in the . . . . quality of the school buildings and equip-\n      ment. . . . Schools described by witnesses as ‘white’ ranged\n      well up and down on both sides of [the average per-pupil\n      expenditure], and schools described by witnesses as ‘black’\n      showed a similar variation.\" 300 F. Supp. at 1366.\n\n      August 1969 - \"The defendants contended and the court\n      found in its April 23, 1969 order that facilities and teachers\n      in the various black schools were not measurably inferior to\n      those in the various white schools. It is too late now to\n      expect the court to proceed upon an opposite assumption.\"\n      306 F.

Supp. at 625.\n\nToward the close of the prior proceedings in 1975 (and consistent\nwith the above), Judge McMillan awarded attorney’s fees to the\nSwann plaintiffs as prevailing parties, \"[e]xcept for the refusal of the\ncourt to find in the plaintiffs’ favor . . . regarding adequacy of physi-\ncal plants and equipment and teacher quality.\" Swann, 66 F.R.D. at\n484.\n\n   Judge Potter acknowledged that no court \"ha[d] [ ]ever granted uni-\ntary status to CMS, nor . . . partially withdrawn supervision as to\nfacilities or any other Green factor.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at\n262. The court nevertheless relied on the above 1969 and 1971 find-\nings to release the Capacchione plaintiffs from their burden of prov-\ning CMS unitary with respect to facilities, stating that to proceed\notherwise would \"defy logic.\" Id. at 263. Judge Potter thus accepted\nthe premise that Judge McMillan’s 1969 and 1971 findings \"consti-\ntute collateral estoppel and law of the case\" regarding facilities,\n\"thereby shifting the burden to CMS and the Swann plaintiffs to show\ndiscriminatory intent.\" Id. at 262.\n\n   The district court’s burden-shifting analysis was an error of law.\nOnce the existence of an unlawful dual school system has been estab-\nlished and court supervision begun, it is presumed that racial dispari-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     129\nties arising during the period of intervention \"are causally related to\nprior segregation.\" School Bd. of the City of Richmond v. Baliles, 829\nF.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). Following the imposition of judicial\ncontrol, a party seeking to end the status quo bears the burden of over-\ncoming the presumption of causation. If this burden is met and the\nschool system is declared to have achieved unitary status as to the\nparticular factor at issue, the presumption ends. Id. Generally, in any\nsubsequent proceeding involving new allegations of disparate treat-\nment, the complaining party must show purposeful discrimination.\nRiddick, 784 F.2d at 537 (concluding that Swann and its progeny\nrequire proof of \"discriminatory intent on the part of the school board\nof a unitary school system\" in order to resume court supervision).12\n\n   To be sure, the absence heretofore of any finding to the contrary\nwould have been an important consideration in determining whether\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs had proved CMS to have achieved unitary\nstatus with respect to facilities. However, that Judge McMillan did not\nintend his initial observations regarding facilities to be construed as\na finding of unitary status is obvious from his subsequent actions. In\n1973, Judge McMillan assumed control over facilities and resources,\nfound inequities, and ordered CMS to remedy those disparities. See\nSwann, 362 F. Supp. at 1235 (finding Double Oaks Elementary access\nroad still undeveloped two years after court’s identification of the\nproblem — \"No $80,000,000 budget is so powerless.\"); id. (finding\nDouble Oaks library not restored to standards several years after fire);\nid. at 1238 (ordering athletic facilities at West Charlotte High School\nimmediately upgraded to level comparable with other schools in the\ncounty). We must conclude that the Board has been subject to the\ncourt’s jurisdiction as to its facilities since at least 1973. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 246 (school boards entitled to a \"rather precise statement\"\nterminating a desegregation order).\n\n  The asserted lack of a prior adverse finding should not have been\ndeterminative of the issue, especially as the district court in 1969 was\nnot focusing on a school system suddenly thrust into the judicial\n  12\n    However, if a district court retains jurisdiction over one or more\nGreen factors, it may, upon a proper showing, reassert control over a fac-\ntor previously adjudged to have attained unitary status. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 508-09 (Souter, J., concurring).\n\f130     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\narena, but was instead examining one that had been subject to court\nsupervision for nearly four years. Between the commencement of the\ninitial Swann lawsuit in 1965 and the district court’s first mention of\nthe facilities issue in April 1969, CMS closed sixteen black schools.\nThe Board’s en masse action gives rise to an almost undeniable infer-\nence that these schools were shut down because they were inferior,\nand the timing also suggests strongly that the closures were prompted\nby the judicial proceedings then underway.\n\n   Viewed in context, the most plausible conclusion is that the puta-\ntive equality mentioned by the district court in 1969 and 1971 was\nactually an endorsement of the steps that had been taken by the Board\nto remedy the inequities in facilities. In any event, CMS could not be\nsaid to have achieved unitary status absent a finding by the lower\ncourt that the Board had \"eliminated the vestiges of its prior discrimi-\nnation,\" embodied in an \"adjudicat[ion] . . . through the proper judi-\ncial procedures.\" Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v.\nGeorgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1413 n.12 (11th Cir. 1985), quoted in\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (noting distinction between school systems\noperating in an unitary fashion and those that have achieved unitary\nstatus, and observing that the former \"could be called unitary and nev-\nertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination\").\n\n   Thirty-five years have passed since the Board first acted to equalize\nits facilities, yet serious questions remain as to whether it has finally\nrealized that goal. Dr. Dwayne E. Gardner, an impressively qualified\neducational planner and consultant, compiled an exhaustive report for\nthe Board in which he evaluated the suitability of its school facilities.13\nDr. Gardner examined and personally visited more than half of the\nschools in CMS (including all of the high schools), analyzing a host\nof factors affecting educational quality. For the purposes of his study,\nDr. Gardner divided the subject schools into three groups: (1) all\nimbalanced-black schools; (2) all racially balanced schools in\nimbalanced-black census tracts; and (3) each remaining high school,\nalong with a set of elementary and middle schools randomly selected\n  13\n   The district court found that the expert called on behalf of the\nCapacchione plaintiffs, Dr. David J. Armor, could offer no reliable testi-\nmony on the subject. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 264.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     131\nfrom the remaining schools and approximately equal in number to\nthose already included within the first two groups.\n\n   Each school in the study was assigned a composite score from 0-\n100, indicating its worthiness. Schools scoring 44 or lower were, in\nDr. Gardner’s opinion, so deficient as to merit replacement, while\nthose with scores between 45-59 were classified as needing \"major\nimprovements.\" Any school that scored 60 or above was \"considered\nto have the ability to serve the educational program adequately.\" J.A.\n12174.\n\n   The results of Dr. Gardner’s study are troubling. The average score\nfor the forty Group 3 schools (racially balanced or imbalanced-white\nin predominantly white or balanced areas) was 61.7. Although the\nGroup 3 data indicate a situation that is far from ideal, the ten Group\n2 schools (racially balanced in predominantly black areas) fared much\nworse, with an average score of 56.3. The scores of the twenty-three\nGroup 1 schools (imbalanced-black) were worse still, averaging just\n53.3.14 At trial, Dr. Gardner confirmed that the disparities apparent\n  14\n     It has been famously said (by either Mark Twain or, earlier, Benja-\nmin Disraeli, depending on one’s source), \"There are three kinds of lies\n— lies, damned lies and statistics.\" A common difficulty in dealing with\nstatistics is illustrated by the district court’s analysis of Dr. Gardner’s\nstudy. The court first noted that, of the four schools scoring in the lowest\ncategory, two were in Group 1 and two were in Group 3. Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 264-65. Next, the court observed that the two highest\nratings accorded elementary schools were again split between Groups 1\nand 3. Id. at 265. Based on this selective culling of the data, the lower\ncourt concluded that \"the results of Dr. Gardner’s analysis do not show\ndisparities along racial lines.\" Id. at 264.\n   The forest that is CMS is not sufficiently mapped by the documenta-\ntion of a few trees. We could accurately say, for example, that omission\nfrom Group 1 of the brand-new elementary school referred to by the dis-\ntrict court as having one of the highest ratings would lower the Group 1\naverage by more than a full point. Or we could state without error that\nseven of the twenty-three Group 1 schools (more than 30 percent) scored\nbelow 50, while only five of the forty Group 3 schools (12.5 percent)\nscored similarly. Indeed, we note that none of the Group 1 high schools\nscored higher than 46, yet all those in Groups 2 and 3 scored at 50 or\n\f132      BELK v.

J.A. 6196-99.\n\n   The anecdotal accounts of a number of witnesses effectively cor-\nroborated Dr. Gardner’s conclusions. See, e.g., J.A. 4992 (testimony\nof Board member Pamela R. Mange) (schools with \"more severe\"\nproblems tended to be predominantly black); J.A. 4769 (testimony of\nAnnelle Houk) (\"[T]he schools that were in the worst repair and had\nthe poorest supply of resources . . . were on the west side and they\nwere predominantly populated by black students.\"). John A. Kramer,\nco-chair of an advisory task force created by the Board, made formal\nvisits to several CMS schools in 1997. Among the locales on Mr.\nKramer’s itinerary were Elizabeth Lane Elementary, a predominantly\nwhite school located in a prosperous suburban area of the county, and\nShamrock Gardens Elementary, a downtown school with an African-\nAmerican student population exceeding sixty percent. Mr. Kramer’s\ndescriptions of his visits contrasted sharply:\n\n         [T]o compare Elizabeth Lane Elementary as an example,\n      which is a relatively new school located in Matthews, I\n      walked into that school, I was overwhelmed because I had\n      never set foot in a school that was like that before. It was\n      clean, it was light and airy, it was a beautiful facility. . . .\n      My overwhelming feeling was, wow, I wish my kids could\n      go to this school. And another observation that was very\n      clear was that when I looked at the student body, it was vir-\n\nabove. Of course, one would rightly view this latter declaration with\nsome skepticism once it became known that there are but fourteen high\nschools in CMS, only two of which were included by Dr. Gardner in\nGroup 1.\n   The pick-and-choose method gets us nowhere. The value of Dr. Gard-\nner’s research lies in the general conclusions that can be drawn from the\nentirety of the data. The most obvious conclusion is that, as a general\nmatter, imbalanced-black schools in CMS are in worse shape than those\nattended by larger proportions of white students. Once we accept that\npremise, the lone remaining question of any significance is \"Why?\"\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      133\n     tually all white students, obviously, affluent, happy kids\n     having a great time.\n\n        On the other hand, my experience, for example, at Sham-\n     rock Gardens was shocking by comparison. I had never vis-\n     ited either one of these schools before, but to visit that\n     school which is in the inner city, the students are predomi-\n     nantly black students, it reminded me of a rundown 1950s\n     motel. There was literally no access to the rooms except by\n     outer walkways that were covered by rusted, dilapidated\n     overhead fixtures. . . . They were using closets and things\n     to teach children in. The carpets were stained and thread-\n     bare. . . . It just didn’t feel clean, it didn’t feel good. And\n     I can honestly say that as a parent, my heartfelt reaction was\n     relief that my children didn’t have to go to school there.\n\nJ.A. 6098-99. Even those Board members who voted to pursue a\ndetermination of unitary status before the district court admitted that\ndisparity in facilities was a problem within CMS. J.A. 1817, 1820\n(testimony of James H. Puckett); J.A. 1918-19 (testimony of John W.\nLassiter); J.A. 2095-96 (testimony of Lindalyn Kakadelis).\n\n   Although it seems reasonably clear that a racial disparity in facili-\nties exists in CMS, its cause is somewhat less apparent. The Capacch-\nione plaintiffs maintain that no discrepancies exist in CMS facilities,\nand even if they do, such discrepancies are totally benign in origin.\nHad the Capacchione plaintiffs proved their theory, we would be con-\nstrained to affirm the district court’s conclusion that unitary status has\nbeen achieved with respect to the facilities factor. The district court,\nhowever, required the Capacchione plaintiffs to prove nothing; it\ninstead erroneously placed the burden on CMS and the Swann plain-\ntiffs to affirmatively show that the present inequities in facilities are\na vestige of official discrimination, i.e., causally related to the prior\nde jure system of segregation. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267.\n\n   The district court erred as a matter of law in foreclosing the devel-\nopment of evidence relevant to a proper vestige analysis. We would\ntherefore remand this portion of the case to permit the parties and the\ndistrict court to elicit the additional facts necessary to fully consider\nthe question of causation with respect to the current racial inequities\n\f134     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD           OF   EDUCATION\nin facilities. Because CMS has not been previously adjudged to have\nattained unitary status, we would charge the Capacchione plaintiffs\non remand with the burden of demonstrating that the vestiges of past\nde jure racial discrimination in the context of the school system’s\nfacilities have been eliminated \"root and branch\" to the extent practica-\nble.15\n\n  15\n     The district court made no findings as to whether practicable reme-\ndies exist with respect to facilities. In light of the court’s refusal to con-\nsider the Board’s proposed five-year Remedial Plan, it cannot be\ndetermined in the first instance whether practicable remedies to the cur-\nrent disparities exist. We note, however, that the Remedial Plan specifi-\ncally identifies disparities associated with race in baseline needs for\nschools’ instructional materials and media centers, and the lack of any\nstandardized criteria to evaluate the adequacy of these resources. J.A.\n11037-38. The Plan proposes to achieve uniformity in resources across\nschools by imbalanced allocations that reflect the schools’ current\nresource gaps and imbalances. J.A. 11038-40. Likewise, the Remedial\nPlan identifies disparities associated with race in the instructional facili-\nties, and proposes building replacements or renovating existing facilities\nfor sixteen schools that are either racially identifiable as black or are\nlocated in a predominantly black census tract. J.A. 11041-42. Uniform\nbuilding maintenance standards and procedures are proposed. J.A.\n11043. Monitoring, evaluation, and development of appropriate criteria\nfor evaluation are also proposed to maintain equity across the school sys-\ntem’s resources and facilities. J.A. 11038-40, 11042-43.\n\fBELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD   OF   EDUCATION   135\n                                             Volume 4 of 4\n\f136    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                          3. Transportation\n\n   “School bus transportation was at the epicenter of the original\nSwann litigation, specifically the degree to which involuntary busing\ncould be used to implement a remedial desegregation decree. The\nSupreme Court in Swann, of course, approved busing as a \"normal\nand accepted tool of educational policy,\" 402 U.S. at 29, at least to\nthe extent that the rigors of time and distance would pose little risk\nto the affected students’ health or to the educational process as a\nwhole. See id. at 30-31. In the intervening twenty-nine years, CMS\nhas taken the Court’s license to heart; during the 1998-99 school year,\nfive of every six students in the school system rode a school bus.\n\n   Upon review of the Green factor of transportation, Judge Potter\nconcluded that \"a court may grant unitary status when transportation\nis provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\" 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267. In\nother words, according to the district court, a school system achieves\nunitary status with respect to transportation once it provides access to\ntransportation non-discriminatorily to black and white children.\nBecause CMS provides all children, regardless of race, access to\ntransportation, Judge Potter concluded that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus with respect to this Green factor.\n\n  We must be mindful of the Supreme Court’s command to consider\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     137\nthe interrelatedness of the various Green factors. See Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 491 (court must consider \"whether retention of judicial control\nis necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in\nother facets of the school system\"). In this context, we can only con-\nclude that the Green factor of transportation is so inextricably inter-\ntwined with the Green factors of student assignment and facilities that\nvacatur on these latter issues would also mandate vacatur on the former.16\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs maintain and offer substantial record evidence\nthat the burdens of busing for desegregation purposes are being borne\ndisproportionately and unfairly by African-American children. Brief\nof Appellants at 31-32, 33-35; see Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1298 (dis-\ntrict court commenting in initial stages of remediation that it did not\nintend \"to endorse or approve any future plan which puts the burden\nof desegregation primarily upon one race\"). Eighty percent of stu-\ndents who currently ride the bus as a result of a mandatory assignment\nare African-American. Judge Potter rejected any consideration of this\n  16\n     Pursuant to Freeman, the district court accepted the invitation of the\nBoard and the Swann plaintiffs to consider whether vestiges of official\ndiscrimination remain concerning the ancillary factors of student\nachievement and student discipline. The court found in the negative, con-\ncluding that CMS had attained unitary status in both areas. We agree that\nthe district court’s judgment regarding student discipline should be\naffirmed.\n   With respect to the ancillary factor of student achievement, however,\nwe would vacate Judge Potter’s holding that unitary status had been\nachieved. Judge Potter found that disparities in student achievement\nexisted but that the disparities (1) were not vestiges of de jure segrega-\ntion and (2) could not be remedied by any practicable measure. Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 280-81. An analysis of disparities in student\nachievement may only be appropriate once the school system has\nachieved unitary status in other respects. See Swann, 306 F. Supp at 1309\n(\"Until unlawful segregation is eliminated, it is idle to speculate whether\nsome of this [achievement] gap can be charged to racial differences or\nto ‘socio-economic-cultural’ lag.\"). At the very least, student achieve-\nment in this case is inextricably intertwined with the other Green factors,\nparticularly student assignment. Therefore, for reasons akin to those dis-\ncussed in our analysis of the Green factor of transportation, we would\nlikewise conclude that the student achievement factor requires further\nconsideration.\n\f138     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\nevidence, holding that a school district has achieved unitary status\nwith respect to transportation as soon as it is provided on a race-\nneutral basis. The evidence, however, demonstrates the close interre-\nlationship of transportation with student assignment. In view of our\nconclusion that CMS is not yet unitary with regard to student assign-\nment, we think it is premature to relinquish control over transporta-\ntion at this stage.17\n\n                               4. Faculty\n\n   Our analysis of this factor must take two concerns into account. We\nmust determine both whether CMS has generally eliminated the ves-\ntiges of discrimination in faculty assignment, and whether the teach-\ners assigned to predominantly black schools are of comparable quality\nto those teaching in schools with large numbers of white students.18\nSee Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (final desegregation order directing\nthat the racial composition of faculty assigned to each school reflect\nthat of the system at large, with the proviso that \"the competence and\nexperience of teachers in formerly or recently black schools will not\nbe inferior to those in the formerly or recently white schools in the\nsystem\").\n  17\n      While the Remedial Plan does not specifically address transportation\nas a Green factor, it does propose siting new schools in a manner calcu-\nlated to promote racial balance in CMS. J.A. 11042. If CMS chooses\nsites for new schools that are more accessible to the majority of the black\npopulation, we presume that fewer black students would have to be\nbused to the suburbs for purposes of desegretation. A new approach to\nschool siting would address the vestiges of past discrimination, if such\nvestiges remain, in those areas in which CMS has not yet achieved uni-\ntary status.\n   18\n      The district court considered a particular school to be racially imbal-\nanced if its proportion of African-American students varied more than\nfifteen percent from the district-wide average. In 1998-99, African-\nAmericans represented 42.7% of the elementary students in CMS, 41.7%\nof the middle school students, and 39.6% of the high school students.\nJ.A. 11574. An elementary school would therefore be designated\nimbalanced-black if more than 57.7% of its students are African-\nAmerican; conversely, if African-Americans constituted less than 27.7%\nof the student body, the school would be designated imbalanced-white.\n\f           BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD           OF   EDUCATION        139\n   The evidence at trial demonstrated that CMS assigned its faculty\nin substantial compliance with the desegregation order at least until\n1992, when school principals were granted the leeway to actively\nrecruit new teachers without the strictures of maintaining a specific\nracial proportion. As a result of this gravitation from centralized to\nsite-based control of faculty assignments, a trend away from propor-\ntionality has emerged. In 1998-99, one-third of the 126 schools cov-\nered by the remedial decree had a proportion of black faculty\ndeviating more than ten percent from the system-wide norm (about\ntwenty-one percent). Prior to the 1992 change in policy, no more than\none-sixth of the schools had ever been so situated.\n\n   We are satisfied that the current trend toward faculty imbalance is\nneither a vestige of the dual system nor the product of subsequent dis-\ncrimination. There is no evidence that this trend results from legal or\nadministrative compulsion within CMS or from perceptions about the\ndesirability or undesirability of teaching positions in schools that\nserve students of predominantly one race. In short, we do not perceive\na causal relationship between past de jure segregation and the present\nassignment of faculty members to schools within CMS.19\n\n   Nor do we think that this trend toward more racially imbalanced\nfaculties has resulted in disparities in the quality of teaching, as mea-\nsured by the instructors’ years of experience and post-graduate work.\nIndeed, there is no significant difference in experience between facul-\nties at imbalanced-black schools as compared to those that are\nimbalanced-white. Faculties at black schools are about one year less\nexperienced than the district-wide average, while faculties at white\n  19\n     Even if the pattern of faculty assignments were somehow shown to\nbe a vestige of past official discrimination, the evidence before the dis-\ntrict court casts substantial doubt upon the Board’s ability to effect a\npracticable remedy. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 258-59:\n       CMS runs the risk of losing significant numbers of teachers if its\n       faculty assignment policies become too restrictive. . . . Another\n       practical problem faced by the district is the fact that it must con-\n       stantly hire thousands of new teachers in the midst of a national\n       teacher shortage . . . . [which] is especially pronounced with\n       regard to black teachers, particularly in this region of the coun-\n       try.\n\f140     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nschools are correspondingly more seasoned. This disparity may\narouse some initial concerns, until one is informed that the typical\nCMS teacher has spent more than ten years in the classroom. The\nupshot is that black and white students alike are, with no meaningful\ndistinction, enjoying the benefits of their teachers’ substantial experi-\nence.\n\n   The difference in post-graduate education between black-school\nand white-school faculties is more pronounced. For every three teach-\ners holding advanced degrees who ply their craft at imbalanced-white\nschools, there are only two similarly qualified teachers assigned to\nschools that are imbalanced-black. Compared to the district average,\nwhite schools have a somewhat larger proportion of these highly\ntrained instructors, while the allotment granted to black schools is\nslightly less than the norm.\n\n   Although these facts give us reason for concern, we think it impru-\ndent to disturb the district court’s conclusion that the trial evidence\naffirmatively disclosed no link between past discrimination and the\ncurrent asymmetry. Most revealing on this point is that, until now, the\nissue of teacher quality within CMS has not been contested. The 1970\ndesegregation order mandating equal competence and experience in\nfaculty assignments was not meant to remedy disparities then exist-\ning, but was instead intended to caution against future imbalances. In\nthe intervening thirty years, there is little indication that CMS has\nneglected to heed the warning inherent in that order. We therefore\nagree that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the\ndeveloping disparities in teacher assignments and any (perhaps super-\nficial) deficiency in the quality of instruction currently afforded\nAfrican-American children are unrelated to the de jure segregation\nonce prevalent in the school system.20\n\n  20\n    Although the Board’s official position, as outlined in its Remedial\nPlan, is that remediable vestiges of de jure segregation do remain as to\nfaculty assignments and quality, the clear weight of the evidence is to the\ncontrary. The district court’s failure to consider the Plan was therefore\nharmless in this narrow respect.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    141\n                               5. Staff\n\n   In substantially the same manner as it spoke to the allocation of\nteachers, the final desegregation order provided that \"the internal\noperation of each school, and the assignment and management of\nschool employees, of course be conducted on a non-racial, non-\ndiscriminatory basis.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 269. Inasmuch as the\nSwann plaintiffs raised no challenge to the school system’s compli-\nance with the desegregation order in this regard, the court below\nfound CMS to have achieved unitary status with regard to its support\nstaff. We agree that this aspect of the district court’s judgment should\nbe affirmed.\n\n                    6. Extracurricular activities\n\n   According to the evidence at trial, African-American students in\nCMS participate in athletics and hold class office at a rate proportion-\nate to their numbers. These same students lag far behind, however,\nwhen it comes to participating in co-curricular clubs and honors pro-\ngrams. J.A. 11634. However, the scope of our inquiry concerning\nextracurricular activities is limited. We need only determine whether\nthe school system permits its students equal access to extracurricular\nactivities, without regard to race. Coalition to Save Our Children v.\nState Bd. of Educ. of Delaware, 90 F.3d 752, 768-69 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(citation omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 18-19 (\"[T]he first\nremedial responsibility of school authorities is to eliminate invidious\nracial distinctions. With respect to such matters as transportation, sup-\nporting personnel, and extracurricular activities, no more than this\nmay be necessary. . . . In these areas, normal administrative practice\nshould produce schools of like quality, facilities, and staffs.\").\n\n   The criterion of equal access is surely satisfied in this regard. Par-\nticipation in honors programs and co-curricular clubs is strictly volun-\ntary, and there is no evidence that the lack of participation by African-\nAmerican students in certain activities reflects the efforts of CMS to\nexclude them. We discern no error in the district court’s conclusions\nregarding this Green factor.\n\n                                   C.\n\n   Pursuant to the foregoing, we agree that the district court should be\naffirmed in its determination of unitary status with respect to faculty,\n\f142     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nstaff, extracurricular activities, and student discipline. However, we\nbelieve that the court’s judgment should be vacated and the case\nremanded for further consideration in the areas of student assignment,\nfacilities, transportation, and student achievement.\n\n                                   III.\n\n   We now turn to the question of whether the Board’s adoption of\nthe expanded magnet schools program with its race-conscious assign-\nment policy violates the Constitution. We conclude that it does not.21\nSee also Wilkinson Op. at 72-75.\n\n   At the outset, we note that it is undisputed that this expanded mag-\nnet schools program differs in critical respects from all race-based\nstudent assignment plans that have been held to be in conflict with the\nEqual Protection Clause. Unlike school districts found to have vio-\nlated the Constitution, CMS adopted the challenged program while\noperating a dual, segregated school system, under a myriad of court\norders commanding the Board to eliminate the unlawful segregation.\n\n    The court orders — the public record attests to their numerosity\nand demands — require CMS to use its expertise and best efforts to\ndesegregate its schools promptly. The federal court repeatedly\ndirected the school board to employ its \"full ‘know-how’ and\nresources\" to use \"any means at [its] disposal\" to do away with the\nunconstitutionally segregated school system. Swann, 311 F. Supp. at\n269; accord Swann, 318 F. Supp. at 802 (characterizing this directive\nas the \"most important single element\" of its order); see also Swann,\n402 U.S. at 15 (\"[S]chool authorities are ‘clearly charged with the\naffirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert\nto a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be elimi-\nnated root and branch.’\") (quoting Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38)\n(emphasis added); Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1105 (giving CMS the\nauthority to resolve \"the sizeable continuing problems yet remaining\n. . . by spontaneous action by staff or board\"); Swann, 306 F. Supp.\n  21\n    We review the district court’s factual findings for clear error and its\nlegal conclusions de novo. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474; United States\nv. Texas, 158 F.3d 299, 306 n.8 (5th Cir. 1998); Little Rock Sch. Dist.\nv. North Little Rock Sch. Dist., 109 F.3d 514, 516 (8th Cir. 1997).\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    143\nat 1297 (leaving \"[t]he choice of how to do the job of desegregation\"\nto CMS, and noting it \"has wide discretion in choosing methods\")\n(emphasis added); Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360 (providing CMS with\nauthority \"to consider all known ways of desegregation\") (emphasis\nadded). Accord Freeman, 503 U.S. at 485 (\"The duty and responsibil-\nity of a school district once segregated by law is to take all steps nec-\nessary to eliminate the vestiges of the unconstitutional de jure\nsystem.\") (first emphasis added).\n\n   Nor is there any doubt that at the time CMS adopted the expanded\nmagnet schools plan, it was not a unitary school system. This is\nbecause even if Judge Potter did not err in decreeing that CMS has\nnow achieved unitary status (and we believe he did), prior to his deci-\nsion, no court had ever determined that CMS had attained unitary sta-\ntus. As the Capacchione plaintiffs concede, Judge Potter’s decision\n— not some earlier event — \"terminated [the] injunction\" issued by\nJudge McMillan and affirmed by the Supreme Court. Brief of Appel-\nlees at 3.\n\n   Judge Potter properly acknowledged both the governing court\norders and the fact that the remedial measures CMS took pursuant to\nthem, including expansion of its magnet schools program, could not\nbe analyzed as if taken by a \"de facto\" unitary school district. See\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (\"The Court finds no legal basis\nfor a finding of de facto unitary status that would abrogate CMS’s\nimmunity retroactively. In other words, the termination of court\nsupervision cannot ‘relate back’ to an earlier time.\"). Yet, notwith-\nstanding CMS’s undisputed status as a dual school district under mul-\ntiple court orders to desegregate its schools, the judge held that the\nBoard’s adoption of the expanded magnet schools program violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause. Furthermore, he found this constitutional\nviolation rendered CMS liable to the Capacchione plaintiffs for dam-\nages and enormous attorney’s fees.\n\n   The Capacchione plaintiffs seek to uphold that ruling on several\ngrounds. First and principally, they contend that the Board’s increased\nreliance on magnet schools constituted a \"voluntary desegregation\nplan implemented to counteract demographic change,\" rather than a\ngood faith effort to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination as\nrequired by the court orders governing this case. Second, they argue\n\f144    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nthat the expanded program’s race-conscious assignment policy vio-\nlated the existing desegregation orders. Finally, they maintain that,\neven if CMS expanded its magnet schools program pursuant to and\nin compliance with governing court orders, strict scrutiny nonetheless\napplies and requires that the program be held unconstitutional. The\ndistrict court properly rejected the first and third arguments, and the\ndissent does not seek to resurrect them. Accordingly, although we\naddress all of these contentions, we initially examine the second, the\nonly one on which the district court, or the dissent, relies.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   In concluding that the expanded magnet schools program violated\nthe Constitution, the district court committed two fatal errors. Ini-\ntially, it ignored the extent of the protection afforded an entity gov-\nerned by federal court orders. Then, the district court refused to\nrecognize the broad directives and expansive terms of the controlling\ncourt orders, and so failed to appreciate that the Board expanded its\nmagnet schools program in good faith to comply with these orders,\nand thus cannot be held to have violated the Constitution. The dissent\nreplicates both errors.\n\n                                   1.\n\n   Judge Potter, like the dissent, does pay lip service to the \"immu-\nnity\" the Board enjoyed because it was subject to numerous judicial\ndesegregation decrees, see, e.g., Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 285\n(\"CMS enjoys immunity from liability for any actions it took consis-\ntent with the Court’s injunction.\"); Traxler Op. at 46. But the district\ncourt and the dissent apparently do not understand what the numerous\ncourt orders in this case required of CMS and the breadth of the pro-\ntection those orders afforded to it. Thus, both Judge Potter and the\ndissent mention the subject only in passing, failing even to cite con-\ntrolling Supreme Court cases on point. See id.\n\n   A person or entity subject to a judicial decree or injunction (as\nCMS indisputably was when operating its dual, segregated school\nsystem) must comply with that decree or injunction, notwithstanding\nits possible unlawfulness. Thus, the Supreme Court has clearly and\nunequivocally directed that \"persons subject to an injunctive order\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    145\nissued by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that decree\nuntil it is modified or reversed, even if they have proper grounds to\nobject to the order.\" GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union of the\nUnited States, 445 U.S. 375, 386 (1980) (emphasis added); see also\nW.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 759, 461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983).\n\n   The only possible exceptions to this \"important public policy,\"\nW.R. Grace, 461 U.S. at 766, arise if a court lacks jurisdiction over\nthe subject matter of the order or the order has \"‘only a frivolous pre-\ntense to validity.’\" GTE, 445 U.S. at 386 (quoting Walker v. City of\nBirmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 315 (1967)). Without question, the fed-\neral court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the desegregation\norders issued in this case and no one suggests that those orders consti-\ntuted \"only a frivolous pretense to validity.\"\n\n   Accordingly, CMS had to obey those orders. This is so notwith-\nstanding that those orders may have required the Board to forego\ncompeting obligations, see W.R. Grace, 461 U.S. at 767-68, including\nobligations seemingly required by a federal statute, see GTE, 445 U.S.\nat 378 & n.2, 386-87, or the Constitution itself, see Walker, 388 U.S.\nat 317. Indeed, the Supreme Court has explained that to hold that an\nentity acts \"improperly\" in obeying a valid court order \"would do vio-\nlence to the common understanding of the term ‘improperly,’\" even\nif the order is later held unlawful or unconstitutional. GTE, 445 U.S.\nat 387. Moreover, a court order need not mandate specific or precise\nprocedures to compel obedience. Thus, although the Court noted the\n\"breadth and vagueness\" of the injunction challenged in Walker, it\nnonetheless held that the injunction had to be obeyed until \"modified\nor dissolved.\" Walker, 388 U.S. at 317.\n\n   \"Violations of [a court] order are punishable as criminal contempt\neven though the order is set aside on appeal.\" United States v. United\nMine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 294 (1947). Accord Spangler, 427 U.S.\nat 438 (\"Violation of an injunctive decree . . . can result in punish-\nment for contempt in the form of either a fine or imprisonment.\").\nConversely, when a person or entity acts in good faith to comply with\na court order, it should not be punished. Thus, in words that resound\nhere, the Supreme Court has explained that \"a school board and a\nschool constituency which attempt to comply with a [court-ordered\n\f146    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\ndesegregation] plan to the best of their ability should not be penal-\nized.\" Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 421 (1977).\n\n   Indeed, the Supreme Court has twice expressly held that school\nboards under court orders to desegregate must comply with those\ndesegregation decrees until absolved of that obligation by a subse-\nquent court order, even if the existing desegregation decrees are\nimproper or unnecessary. In Spangler, the Court concluded that the\ndistrict court exceeded its remedial discretion when it ordered the Pas-\nadena school district to reconfigure its student attendance zones annu-\nally so that there would be \"no majority of any minority\" in any\nschool. 427 U.S. at 434-35. Despite the impropriety of this order, the\nCourt held that the school board had to obey the order until it was\nproperly modified or reversed by a court. See id. at 439-40 (\"[T]hose\nwho are subject to the commands of an injunctive order must obey\nthose commands, notwithstanding eminently reasonable and proper\nobjections to the order, until it is modified or reversed.\").\n\n   Similarly, in Dowell, the Court refused to interpret an arguably\nambiguous court order as having terminated the desegregation decree\npreviously entered against the Oklahoma City school board. Instead,\nthe Court remanded the case to the district court for a determination\nof \"whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitutional\ncompliance . . . to allow the injunction to be dissolved.\" Dowell, 498\nU.S. at 249. In doing so, the Court explained that judicial orders carry\nbinding authority until they are modified or dissolved.\n\n   Moreover, the Dowell Court rejected precisely the kind of argu-\nment the Capacchione plaintiffs seek to make here. In Dowell, as\nhere, those challenging the school board’s actions argued (and the\ncourt of appeals found) that the school board \"unilaterally and con-\ntrary to specific provisions\" of the controlling court orders \"acted in\na manner not contemplated by the court in its earlier decrees.\" Dowell\nby Dowell v. Bd. of Educ. of Okla., 795 F.2d 1516, 1521 (10th Cir.\n1986). The Supreme Court acknowledged that this might well be so,\nbut concluded that nonetheless it did \"not think that the Board should\nbe penalized for relying on the express language of that order.\"\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249 n.1. Similarly, even if CMS had \"acted in a\nmanner not contemplated\" in the governing orders — and clearly it\ndid not, see infra, at part III.A.2 — it should not \"be penalized for\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION    147\nrelying on the express language\" of those orders, Dowell, 498 U.S. at\n249 n.1, i.e., \"to use [its] full ‘know-how’ and resources . . . to\nachieve the constitutional end [i.e., desegregation of the schools] by\nany means at [its] disposal.\" Swann, 318 F. Supp. at 802.\n\n   Of course, the Capacchione plaintiffs could have sought to modify\nor dissolve the Swann orders as inconsistent with their rights under\nthe Constitution; what they could not do is obtain an injunction, or\ndeclaration, that a party compelled to adhere to those orders violated\nthe Constitution in so doing. CMS was obliged to follow the govern-\ning desegregation orders and injunctions, and thus the Board \"should\nnot be penalized,\" Brinkman, 433 U.S. at 421, for its actions, which\nwere taken to comply with those orders and which the district court\nfound, and the dissent does not dispute, were taken in good faith. See\nTraxler Op. at 41.\n\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the desegregation orders\nin this case and the Board’s actions in response to those orders.\n\n                                  2.\n\n   Throughout the course of the desegregation efforts in this case, the\nfederal courts — from the district level to the Supreme Court — have\ntold the Board that it has the authority to take \"whatever steps might\nbe necessary to convert to a unitary system.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 15;\nsee also Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360 (\"The Board is free to consider\nall known ways of desegregation.\") (emphasis added). Thus, CMS has\ncontinually acted under judicial directives that \"[t]he choice of how\nto do the job of desegregation is for the School Board — not for the\ncourt.\" Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1297. See also Wilkinson Op. at 72-\n74.\n\n   Even beyond CMS’s broad discretion to choose its own methods\nof eliminating its unconstitutionally segregated schools, Judge\nMcMillan’s orders repeatedly endorsed the Board’s general power\nand duty to maintain control over the racial composition of the\nschools in order to eliminate the vestiges of the segregated system\n\"root and branch.\" For instance, in 1970 Judge McMillan mandated:\n\f148      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\n      That the defendants maintain a continuing control over the\n      race of children in each school . . . and maintain the racial\n      make-up of each school (including any new and any re-\n      opened schools) to prevent any school from becoming\n      racially identifiable. . . . The duty imposed by the law and\n      by this order is the desegregation of schools and the mainte-\n      nance of that condition. . . . The defendants are encouraged\n      to use their full ‘know-how’ and resources to attain the\n      results above described, and thus to achieve the constitu-\n      tional end by any means at their disposal. The test is not the\n      method or plan, but the results.\n\n311 F. Supp. at 268-69 (emphasis added and emphasis omitted); see\nalso 362 F. Supp. at 1225 (same); 334 F. Supp. at 631 (same); 475\nF. Supp. at 1342 (approving counsel’s statement that \"if this Board of\nEducation chose to run an integrated school system on the basis of\npreconceived ratios, it has that constitutional right\") (emphasis\nadded); 318 F. Supp. at 801 (ordering \"[t]hat ‘freedom of choice’ or\n‘freedom of transfer’ may not be allowed by the Board if the cumula-\ntive effect of any given transfer or group of transfers is to increase\nsubstantially the degree of segregation in the school from which the\ntransfer is requested or in the school to which the transfer is desired\").\n\n   Moreover, Chief Justice Burger’s opinion for the Supreme Court in\nSwann provides explicit sanction of the Board’s use of racial \"ratios\"\nor proportions in assigning students to schools:\n\n      School authorities are traditionally charged with broad\n      power to formulate and implement education policy and\n      might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare\n      students to live in a pluralistic society each school should\n      have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting\n      the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an\n      educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers\n      of school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional\n      violation, however, that would not be within the authority of\n      a federal court.\n\f         BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION      149\n                                    22\n402 U.S. at 16 (emphasis added).\n\n   Not only was CMS empowered to use ratios in student assignments\ngenerally, it was also specifically authorized to use race-conscious\nassignment policies for \"appropriately integrated optional schools.\"\nSwann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103. Judge McMillan approved the Board’s\npolicy, which provided:\n\n       Strict and central control must be exercised over all admis-\n       sions (reassignments) to each optional school in order to\n       fulfill the necessary ends that these schools be open to all\n       county residents and be integrated by grade at or above\n       approximately a 20% black ratio. Reassignments to optional\n       schools must not jeopardize the racial composition of any\n       other school.\n\n          Guidelines and central monitoring by the Pupil Assign-\n       ment staff with the respective school principals are to be\n       drawn up. Capacities and allocation of maximum numbers\n       of students that may be drawn from each other school atten-\n       dance area, by race, are to be designated. The actual enroll-\n       ment of the optional school may have to be guided by its\n       racial composition and by the number drawn from each\n       other school area, not by considerations of space and pro-\n       gram only.\n\nId. at 1108 (emphasis added).\n\n  In response to these directives, in the 1970s CMS established some\n  22\n     The dissent’s suggestion that this holding in Swann was somehow\nabrogated by Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 283 (1986)\nand City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 494 (1989) is\nbaffling. Neither case overruled, explicitly or implicitly, the Swann\nCourt’s authorization for this school board to assign students according\nto a \"prescribed ratio.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 16. This is not an instance in\nwhich CMS is attempting to extend an analogous Supreme Court holding\nto fit its own needs. Rather, the Supreme Court authorized CMS’s actions\nspecifically, and that authorization has never been overruled. As such,\nCMS is entitled to follow it. See infra, at part III.C.\n\f150     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nmagnet schools, which it called \"optional schools.\" These schools\noffered two special curricula — \"open\" and \"traditional\" — both of\nwhich constituted \"very rigorous academic program[s]\" not offered in\n\"conventional schools.\" J.A. 2489, 15683. In 1992, the Board\nexpanded its magnet schools program into a district-wide system with\na wider range of curricular choices. In the expanded magnet schools\nprogram, the Board retained the curricula first available in the early\nmagnet or \"optional\" schools — the \"open\" curriculum emphasizing\n\"interdisciplinary approaches,\" and the \"traditional\" curriculum fea-\nturing a \"highly structured program.\" J.A. 16722-23. Furthermore, six\nof the early magnet schools that offered such curricula prior to 1992\n— Myers Park, Elizabeth, Hawthorne, Irwin Avenue, Piedmont, and\nWest Charlotte — continue to do so today under the expanded magnet\nschools program. Compare J.A. 13448, 13529-40, 15683 (pre-1992\n\"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets) with J.A. 16722-23 (1998-99\n\"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets); see also J.A. 10061 (report indicat-\ning that pre-1992 magnet schools were incorporated into the 1992\nexpanded magnet schools program).23\n  23\n     Judge Potter recognized that the optional schools \"were similar to\ntoday’s magnet schools,\" both having \"countywide enrollment and a\nracial balancing target.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d. at 286. He none-\ntheless concluded that the schools established after 1992 under the\nexpanded magnet schools program \"differ from optional schools in that\n[the new] magnets offer specialized curricula and thereby confer a bene-\nfit above and beyond the regular academic program.\" Id. at 286-87 n. 49.\nThe dissent allies itself with this view, Traxler Op. at 49, but nothing in\nthe record offers any support for it. To the contrary, assuming arguendo\nthat \"specialized curricula\" constitute a \"benefit,\" the magnet schools\ninstituted after 1992 provide precisely the same \"benefit\" as the pre-1992\n\"optional schools.\" See J.A. 10552 (proposed 1992 pupil assignment plan\nrecommending continuation of six magnet schools already in place); J.A.\n15504 (1993 letter noting that magnet schools were called \"optional\nschools\" prior to 1992); J.A. 10651 (Summary of Findings From\nResearch on Magnet Schools explaining that \"[o]ur optional schools\nfunction as magnet schools\"); J.A. 13606, 15581 (Stolee Plan explaining\nthat \"[t]he traditional schools presently existing in Charlotte-\nMecklenburg are good examples\" of curriculum specialty schools,\n\"sometimes called magnet schools\"). After all, it was only because the\noptional schools did offer certain \"specialized curricula\" that parents\n(including Michael Grant, one of the Capacchione plaintiffs, J.A. 2489)\nwere willing, well prior to the 1992 expanded magnet schools program,\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     151\n   The expanded magnet schools program is a typical and appropriate\ndesegregation tool \"conceived and developed in large, urban school\ndistricts seeking a voluntary alternative to busing as a means of\ndecreasing racial segregation.\" J.A. 10654. Even the dissenters recog-\nnize that \"a magnet schools program, properly implemented, can no\ndoubt be an effective desegregation tool.\" Traxler Op. at 50. But they\nnonetheless suggest that the expanded magnet schools program, in\nand of itself, may violate the Constitution. See id. at 71-74. This sug-\ngestion is surprising, given that the federal courts have consistently\napproved magnet school plans as desegregation tools. See, e.g., Mil-\nliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 272 (1977) (Milliken II); Stell v.\nSavannah-Chatham County Bd. of Educ., 888 F.2d 82, 85-86 (11th\nCir. 1989); Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist.\nNo. 1, 839 F.2d 1296, 1309-12 (8th Cir. 1988); United States v. Yon-\nkers Bd. of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1237-39 (2d Cir. 1987); Liddell v.\nMissouri, 731 F.2d 1294, 1310-11 (8th Cir. 1984). The dissent’s sug-\ngestion that CMS somehow violated the Constitution by expanding its\nmagnet schools program and \"abandon[ing] pairings, satellites, and\nfeeders,\" Traxler Op. at 50, seems particularly extraordinary. Magnet\nschools are generally regarded as being a less onerous and more suc-\ncessful desegregation tool than pairing, satellites, or feeders because\nmagnet schools provide more opportunity for student choice. See,\ne.g., Stell, 888 F.2d at 85; Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1239.\n\n   Of course, as Judge McMillan warned, in approving the early mag-\nnet or optional schools, assignment of pupils to such schools must be\nundertaken in a manner that \"provide[s] . . . access to appropriately\nintegrated optional schools,\" and \"prevent[s] significant jeopardy to\nthe racial composition of other schools.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103.24\n\nto enroll their children in desegregated optional schools. See J.A. 13641,\n15616. In fact, the original six \"open\" and \"traditional\" schools remain\namong CMS’s more heavily subscribed magnets. See J.A. 10292-340.\nMyers Park Traditional, for example, had 245 students on its waiting list\nfor the 1998-99 school year. See J.A. 2159.\n   24\n      The dissent’s contention that Judge McMillan \"cautio[ned]\" CMS\nagainst creating optional schools because the schools were marked by\n\"failure\" flies in the face of the court orders. Traxler Op. at 49. In fact,\nthe only warnings that Judge McMillan gave regarding optional schools\n\f152     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nFor this reason, race is, and must be, considered in assigning students\nto the magnet schools instituted under CMS’s expanded program, just\nas it was in assigning students to the original magnet or optional\nschools. See 379 F. Supp. at 1108. Specifically, under the expanded\nprogram, CMS allocates 40% of the seats in its magnet schools for\nblack students and 60% for students of other races. This ratio reflects\nthe student population of the school system, which is approximately\n41.0% black, 52.2% white, 3.7% Asian, 2.5% Hispanic, and .5%\nAmerican Indian. CMS generally assigns students to its magnet\nschools using two parallel lotteries, one for black students and one for\nwhite students. When there has been insufficient interest from black\nstudents to fill the seats allocated to them in a particular school, CMS\nhas sometimes refused to allow students of other races to fill those\nslots. Thus, race may affect a student’s chances of being assigned to\na magnet school.\n\n   It is this portion of the expanded magnet schools program that\nJudge Potter regarded as unconstitutional, reasoning that Judge\nMcMillan \"firmly rejected the use of rigid racial quotas.\" Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 286 (relying on Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1312).\nIn reaching this conclusion, Judge Potter misread the order on which\nhe assertedly relied and ignored the multiple other orders and injunc-\ntions governing this case.\n\nwere against repeating the past \"failure\" to provide adequate transporta-\ntion and against failing to provide \"adequate safeguards against discrimi-\nnatory results,\" so as to prevent optional schools from \"resurrect[ing]\"\n\"freedom of choice\" plans under a new name. Swann, 379 F. Supp. at\n1103-04.\n   Moreover, the dissent’s heavy emphasis on Dr. Stolee’s recommenda-\ntion to the Board that it seek court approval of the expanded magnet\nschools program is puzzling. That one advisor should suggest this does\nnot change the facts, and the critical facts here are that the expanded\nmagnet schools program was simply an expansion of the court-appointed\noptional schools. Even if this were not so, the Board’s decision to ignore\na recommendation from one educational adviser (not a lawyer) on a legal\nmatter certainly does not evidence the Board’s bad faith or render its\naction violative of any court order.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION   153\n   Actually, in the very paragraph on which Judge Potter relied, in\nwhich Judge McMillan held that \"[f]ixed ratios of pupils in particular\nschools will not be set\" by the court, Judge McMillan also held that\n\"efforts should be made [by the school board] to reach a 71-29 ratio\nin the various schools so that there will be no basis for contending\nthat one school is racially different from the others.\" Swann, 306 F.\nSupp. at 1312 (emphasis added). Judge Potter transmuted this state-\nment — an authorization for the Board to make \"efforts\" to \"reach a\n71-29 ratio\" — into a prohibition against the Board assigning students\nto schools on the basis of that fixed ratio. See Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 286. We cannot accept this reading of Judge McMillan’s\norder. Taken as a whole, this paragraph provides some of the clearest\nevidence that Judge McMillan not only authorized the Board to use\nfixed ratios in assigning students to schools but encouraged it to do\nso. Recognizing the impracticability of adopting a court-ordered,\nsystem-wide racial balance to which all schools must adhere, Judge\nMcMillan did observe that \"variations from that [71-29 ratio] may be\nunavoidable.\" Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1312. But that statement\nimposes no limitations on the scope of permissible Board action.\nRather, it suggests that \"variations\" were acceptable only because\nthey were \"unavoidable.\"\n\n   The Board could not have accomplished what the desegregation\norders required without \"using race\" in the way that it \"used race\" in\nthe context of the expanded magnet schools program. In the 1970\norder, affirmed by the Supreme Court, Judge McMillan decreed\n\"[t]hat pupils of all grades be assigned in such a way that as nearly\nas practicable the various schools at various grade levels have about\nthe same proportion of black and white students.\" Swann, 311 F.\nSupp. at 268. We cannot fathom how the Board could set out to\nachieve \"about the same proportion of black and white students\" in\neach grade level in each of its over one hundred schools without\nemploying fixed racial ratios as the central components of its student\nassignment plan. Neither, apparently, could Judge McMillan.\n\n   To achieve \"about the same proportion,\" the Board necessarily had\nto set fixed upper and lower limits on the proportion of white and\nblack students it would permit in each grade in each school. Only\nwith these fixed racial proportions as its lodestars could the Board\nassign students to schools, and approve or deny individual requests to\n\f154     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\ntransfer. The Board could never have justified a denial of a transfer\nrequest without having a fixed conception of exactly how few white\nor black students in a particular school would be too few.\n\n   Indeed, Judge McMillan expressly approved many aspects of the\nCMS desegregation plan that were explicitly based on strict racial\nratios. For example, the Board’s majority-to-minority transfer policy,\nwhich was specifically authorized by the governing desegregation\norders, takes race into account in much the same way as the magnet\nschools assignment policy. Under the transfer policy, a student in the\nracial majority in his current school could freely transfer to a school\nin which he would be in the racial minority. A white student in a\nmajority white school, for example, could freely transfer to a majority\nblack school, but that same student could be denied admission to a\nmajority white school, solely on the basis of a rigid 50% racial ceil-\ning. Meanwhile, a black student at a majority black school could\nfreely transfer into the same majority white school to which the white\nstudent might be denied admission. The Supreme Court approved this\nuse of majority-to-minority transfer policies as \"a useful part of every\ndesegregation plan\" and \"an indispensable remedy.\" Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 26. In fact, Judge McMillan specifically upheld this majority-to-\nminority plan, despite former CMS Superintendent Dr. J. M. Robin-\nson’s complaints about the rigidity of the 50% limit. See Martin, 475\nF. Supp. at 1343 (\"I would like to have had more flexibility than the\n50 percent in some instances, but I would be opposed to recommend-\ning any plan that went, any of the schools going over more than a few\npercentage points above 50 percent.\").\n\n   It is certainly true that Judge McMillan’s orders and the Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in Swann consistently signaled concern with the\nimposition of racial proportions or ratios by federal courts. That con-\ncern, however, is rooted in the problem of federal courts exceeding\ntheir remedial discretion, not in any objection to the use of racial pro-\nportions or ratios by school boards themselves in their desegregation\nplans. Thus, the Supreme Court noted that, \"[t]he constitutional com-\nmand to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every\ncommunity must always reflect the racial composition of the school\nsystem as a whole,\" but went on to conclude that \"the very limited use\nmade of mathematical ratios was within the equitable remedial discre-\ntion of the District Court.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24-25.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     155\n   That this concern with ratios is rooted in the limits of judicial\npower to order remedial action, not in the impropriety of using racial\nproportions to remedy the vestiges of segregation, is nowhere more\napparent than in Chief Justice Burger’s statement in Swann. There,\nthe Chief Justice noted that while in certain circumstances it might be\ninappropriate for a federal court to require adherence to \"a prescribed\nratio of Negro to white students reflecting\" the population of the \"dis-\ntrict as a whole,\" it would be \"within the broad discretionary powers\nof school authorities\" to do so. Id. at 16. See also Wilkinson Op. at\n73.\n\n   Indeed, in Swann’s companion case, North Carolina State Bd. of\nEduc. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45-46 (1971), the Supreme Court held\nthat any attempt to \"inhibit or obstruct\" the Board’s use of racial\nratios \"must fall.\" The Court explained that, \"when past and continu-\ning constitutional violations are found [as they had been in the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg school system], some ratios are likely to be\nuseful starting points in shaping a remedy. An absolute prohibition\nagainst use of such a device . . . contravenes the implicit command\nof Green.\" Id. at 46. The Court expressly recognized that a \"flat pro-\nhibition against assignment of students for the purpose of creating\nracial balance must inevitably conflict with the duty of school authori-\nties to disestablish dual school systems.\" Id. (emphasis added).\n\n   The Board’s authority to employ racial ratios is explicit not only\nin the Supreme Court’s opinions, but also in Judge McMillan’s\nrepeated statements to the effect that \"[i]ndependent of any court\norder . . . if this Board of Education chose to run an integrated school\nsystem on the basis of preconceived ratios, it has that constitutional\nright.\" Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1342 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In fact, early in the litigation Judge McMillan held that:\n\n    Counsel for the plaintiffs says that since the ratio of white\n    to black students is about 70/30, the School Board should\n    assign the children on a basis 70% white and 30% black,\n    and bus them to all the schools. This court does not feel that\n    it has the power to make such a specific order. Nevertheless,\n    the Board does have the power to establish a formula and\n    provide transportation.\n\f156     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nSwann, 300 F. Supp. at 1371 (emphasis added).\n\n   Moreover, this Court upheld \"the validity of the Board’s decision\nto reassign students in order to maintain racial ratios,\" and stated that\nthe \"School Board is vested with broad discretionary powers over\neducational policy and is well within its powers when it decides that\nas a matter of policy schools should not have a majority [over 50%]\nof minority students.\" Martin, 626 F.2d at 1167. Having been repeat-\nedly told by federal courts that it had the \"constitutional right\" to\n\"maintain racial ratios\" to remedy past segregation, CMS cannot now\nbe held to have violated the Constitution for doing exactly what the\ncourts have said it had the power to do.\n\n   In short, time and again, the federal courts at all levels have autho-\nrized the Board to employ racial ratios to remedy its unlawfully segre-\ngated school system. Although the dissent repeatedly contends to the\ncontrary, Traxler Op. at 52, 54, 55, no court has ever prohibited CMS\n(rather than the federal court supervising it) from imposing \"racial\nratios.\" The dissent’s contention that Judge McMillan’s order — man-\ndating a black student population \"about or above 20%\" in the\noptional schools, instead of the Board’s proposed \"at or above\napproximately 20%\" language — constitutes a rejection of \"rigid\nracial quotas,\" Traxler Op. at 53, is singularly unconvincing. It seems\nunlikely that by this slight word difference Judge McMillan even indi-\ncated a disapproval of the Board’s use of \"rigid\" quotas, which would\notherwise have been permitted under the Board’s policy. It seems far\nmore likely that Judge McMillan believed that his order permitting a\nracial ratio \"about or above 20%\" was equivalent to the Board’s pol-\nicy of permitting a racial ratio \"at or above approximately 20%.\" In\nany event, neither linguistic formulation prohibits the Board from\nadopting an 80-20 ratio for the early optional schools, or the 60-40\nratio for magnet schools that it subsequently adopted in 1992, espe-\ncially in light of the Board’s broad discretion and explicit authoriza-\ntion to use strict racial ratios in other areas of its desegregation plan.\n\n   Similarly, the dissent’s suggestion that the expanded magnet\nschools program differs from the \"optional schools\" program because\nthe Board set \"inflexible quotas\" in the expanded plan, Traxler Op. at\n44, is simply not borne out by the record. In truth, in 1992, CMS\nimplemented a 60-40 white-black ratio with an eye to reaching a\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     157\nracial balance that corresponded with the make-up of the entire stu-\ndent population of the school system, just as in 1974 it implemented\nthe 80-20 white-black ratio to correspond with the entire student pop-\nulation at that time. The 60-40 ratio was not applied in any more of\na rigid or \"inflexible\" manner than the earlier ratio; Board policy pro-\nvided that \"all magnet schools would maintain a 60-40 white-black\nratio plus or minus 15%,\" J.A. 13705; see also J.A. 3187, 3193, and\nthe Student Assignment Plan permitted \"racial balance [to] be allowed\nto fluctuate.\" J.A. 15702. The Board’s Executive Director of Planning\nand Student Placement testified that several race-neutral consider-\nations, such as sibling attendance, would allow a school to \"depart\nfrom the 60-40 goal.\" J.A. 3217; see also J.A. 3091-92, 3193-94.\nContrary to the dissent’s claims of rigidity, not a single magnet school\nactually manifested a 60-40 ratio. J.A. 3185. A number of magnet\nschools came close to the stated goal, but the percentage of black stu-\ndents in CMS’s magnet schools ranged from 7% to 82%, id., and stu-\ndents that failed to gain admission to one magnet school \"often ha[d]\na seat waiting for them at another magnet school of their choosing.\"\nJ.A. 3076. In fact, the two \"black seats\" about which Christina Capac-\nchione originally complained were ultimately filled by two white stu-\ndents, despite the supposedly \"inflexible\" ratio. In sum, the 60-40\nratio was not an unbendable \"quota,\" either in policy or in practice,\nany more than the earlier ratio had been.\n\n   Both the Supreme Court and Judge McMillan provided CMS with\n\"wide discretion\" to fashion appropriate remedies in light of the par-\nticular needs of its pupils and the school system’s experience with\nother desegregation tools. Additionally, Judge McMillan approved\nspecific race-conscious assignment measures generally and specifi-\ncally as to magnet schools.25 Thus, when adopting a 60-40 assignment\n  25\n    The dissent, see Traxler Op. at 50, makes much of Judge McMillan’s\n1970 instruction that \"leave of the court be obtained before making any\nmaterial departure from any specific requirement set out herein,\" Swann,\n311 F. Supp. at 270. But the dissent fails to acknowledge that this state-\nment followed Judge McMillan’s declaration that the Board had \"maxi-\nmum discretion . . . to choose methods that will accomplish the required\nresult.\" Id. The \"material departure\" provision was not an attempt to limit\nthe Board’s ability to choose its own methods to move aggressively for-\nward with the desegregation of its schools, but rather was a message that\n\f158     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\nformula in the expanded magnet schools program, the Board not only\nacted within its \"wide discretion,\" but also in accordance with specific\nprocedures approved by the district court.\n\n   Judge Potter’s conclusion (and the dissent’s contention) to the con-\ntrary simply cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court opinion in\nSwann, our opinions in this case, and Judge McMillan’s decrees. The\nmagnet schools’ race-conscious assignment policy constitutes a nec-\nessary safeguard against the risk that unchecked transfers to magnet\nschools could increase the number of racially identifiable schools in\nviolation of the Board’s continuing obligation under the desegregation\norders. See 379 F. Supp. at 1105 (\"Racially identifiable schools may\nnot be operated.\"). In that vein, the Capacchione plaintiffs’ own\nexpert on school desegregation, Dr. David Armor, agreed that racial\nquotas are permissible in a desegregation plan. J.A. 3627. Dr. Armor\ntestified that \"race is an integral part of pairing, of satelliting, of mag-\nnet schools, of running lotteries for magnet schools. The entire plan\nis predicated on race and race controls, because that’s the only way\nyou can meet the court order and to have an effective plan is to\nemploy race requirements and racial quotas basically for all schools.\"\nJ.A. 3434.\n\n   In sum, contrary to Judge Potter’s conclusion, Judge McMillan\nspecifically authorized the use of fixed ratios based on race in assign-\ning students to magnet schools. See 379 F. Supp. at 1104. Further-\nmore, even without such specific authorization, the broad discretion\ngranted the Board by the Supreme Court’s opinion in Swann and by\nthe other court orders and injunctions governing this case permitted\nCMS to fashion magnet schools with racially balanced enrollments.\nThe decrees make plain that ratios based on race were among the\n\"means\" by which the Board was authorized \"to achieve the constitu-\ntional end\" of desegregation. Swann 311 F. Supp. at 268-69; see also\nSwann, 362 F. Supp. at 1225; Swann, 334 F. Supp. at 631. As such,\n\nthis previously recalcitrant school district should not use its \"discretion\"\nto take steps backward, i.e., a \"material departure,\" from its obligation to\nachieve the court-ordered \"goal\" of \"complete desegregation of the entire\nsystem to the maximum extent possible.\" Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1298-\n99.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION    159\nthe Board did not violate the Equal Protection Clause in adopting\nsuch ratios in its expanded magnet schools program.\n\n                                  B.\n\n   As their principal contention, the Capacchione plaintiffs argue that\nthe expanded magnet schools program was a response to demographic\nchange rather than a true attempt to remedy past discrimination. We\ncannot agree.26\n\n    First, Judge Potter \"accept[ed] that the school system was acting to\n. . . remedy[ ] the effects of past racial discrimination\" in expanding\nthe number of magnet schools in 1992. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d\nat 289. Ample record evidence supports this finding. See, e.g., J.A.\n2716 (testimony of John Murphy, former CMS Superintendent, that\n1992 plan to expand the magnet school program was among the \"cre-\native strategies we could come up with to stay in compliance with the\ncourt order\"); J.A. 3869-74 (testimony of Jeff Schiller, former assis-\ntant superintendent for research, assessment, and planning for CMS,\nexplaining that the 1992 student assignment plan, including the\nexpanded magnet schools program, \"had the same objectives as the\none that it was going to replace, maintaining the court order,\" and that\nthe objective of the expanded magnet program specifically was \"to\nmaintain the integration of schools through voluntary means\"); J.A.\n15503-05 (1993 letter from CMS to the U.S. Department of Education\ndiscussing Judge McMillan’s 1974 order and identifying the creation\nof additional magnet schools as among the \"more effective ways . . .\n[to] meet[ ] the guidelines established by the Court\"); J.A. 13607,\n15582 (Stolee Plan recommendation that \"[the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg school desegregation plan should be gradually changed\nfrom a mandatory plan with little voluntarism to a voluntary plan with\nfew mandatory facets\").\n\n  Furthermore, the dichotomy the Capacchione plaintiffs suggest\nbetween \"counter[ing] demographic change,\" on the one hand, and\nremedying past discrimination, on the other, oversimplifies both the\nlaw of school desegregation, particularly the Supreme Court’s deci-\n  26\n    Tellingly, the dissent does not even mention this argument.\n\f160     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\nsions in Green, Swann, and Freeman, and the practical reality of\nachieving desegregation in a large urban school district. From the\nearly stages of the Swann litigation, all concerned have understood\nthat demographic patterns would complicate the process of school\ndesegregation. Indeed, remedies such as school busing and satellite\nattendance zones would never have been necessary in the first place\nif the demography of the community were not an obstacle to desegre-\ngation. In a sense, Swann’s basic teaching is that the Constitution\nsometimes requires schools to \"counter demograph[y]\" in order to\nachieve desegregation. The Swann Court noted that the process of\n\"local authorities . . . meet[ing] their constitutional obligations\" had\n\"been rendered more difficult by changes . . . in the structure and pat-\nterns of communities, the growth of student population, [and] move-\nment of families.\" 402 U.S. at 14. The Court expressed concern that\n\"segregated residential patterns . . . [would] lock the school system\ninto the mold of separation of the races.\" Id. at 21. Thus, CMS simply\nfollowed the Supreme Court’s guidance in Swann in regarding change\nas a problem inhibiting its progress toward unitary status.27\n  27\n     The Capacchione plaintiffs contend that, given the obvious concern\nof school officials with demographic changes, \"CMS could not have\nbeen motivated by any desire to comply with its court-ordered duty to\neradicate vestiges of segregation.\" Brief of Appellees at 85. But this\nstands the analysis on its head. A court determines from the effect of their\nacts, not from their motives, whether school authorities comply with a\ndesegregation decree. See Wright v. Council of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451,\n462 (1972) (\"It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the\nsole or dominant motivation behind choices of a group of legislators, and\nthe same may be said of the choices of a school board. . . . Thus we have\nfocused upon the effect — not the purpose or motivation — of a school\nboard’s action in determining whether it is a permissible method of dis-\nmantling a dual system.\") (internal quotations marks omitted). Moreover,\neven if motivation were relevant, the argument would fail. A fair reading\nof the record demonstrates that although school officials were obviously\naware of the demographic shifts, they viewed these shifts as an obstacle\nto achieving compliance with the Swann orders and to eliminating the\nvestiges of discrimination in the school system, not as the condition that\nitself necessitated a remedy. See, e.g., J.A. 13597-98, 15572-73 (Stolee\nPlan identifying \"a growing and moving population\" as one of several\nfactors creating instability in student assignment under the pre-1992 sys-\ntem of pairing and satelliting); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter from CMS to the\nU.S. Department of Education listing \"demographic and residential pat-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     161\n   Moreover, Freeman simply did not hold, as the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs necessarily imply, that demographic changes in a metropolitan\narea independently eliminate the vestiges of past discrimination. Nor\ndoes Freeman bar courts from targeting racial isolation resulting in\nsignificant part from \"private choice,\" if that isolation is also a vestige\nof past discrimination. The effect of such a holding in Freeman would\nhave been to overrule Green, which the Supreme Court did not pur-\nport to do. In Green, even though the school board allowed every stu-\ndent \"freedom of choice\" as to which school to attend, the formerly\nblack school remained all black and the formerly white school\nremained predominantly white — wholly as a result, in some sense,\nof this \"private choice.\" The Green Court held that, although the pri-\nvate choices of students and their families were responsible for the\ncontinuing racial isolation of the schools’ student populations, that\nfact did not preclude a finding that the racial isolation was also a ves-\ntige of past discrimination. Indeed, the Court held not only that it was\npermissible for the school board to take further action to desegregate,\nbut that the board was required to take further action in order to fulfill\nits \"affirmative duty\" to desegregate. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38.\n\n   Although Freeman recognized that, at a certain point in the process\nof desegregation, a court may determine that present racial isolation\ncannot be considered a by-product of the past regime of segregation,\nthe case does not require — or even empower — a school board\nunder a judicial desegregation order to make that determination on its\nown. Rather, so long as CMS was under court order to desegregate,\nit was required to treat racial isolation in its schools as a vestige of\nsegregation, and to take appropriate action to eliminate that vestige.\nSee Swann, 402 U.S. at 26.\n\nterns\" as one of several increasing strains on the pairing system); J.A.\n2712 (testimony of former CMS Superintendent John Murphy that \"[w]e\nreally weren’t going to be bringing about desegregation and racially bal-\nanced schools unless we began to address the issue of housing at the\nsame time.\"). The Board may have chosen sites for new schools in\nresponse to, or even in furtherance of, these demographic trends, see\nsupra, but in any event the Board also clearly evidenced awareness that\nthe population changes, particularly the greater distance between white\nand black population centers, would put a greater strain on the process\nof desegregation.\n\f162     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                                   C.\n\n   Finally, the Capacchione plaintiffs maintain that, even if CMS\nadministered the expanded magnet schools program pursuant to and\nin conformity with the governing desegregation decrees, CMS vio-\nlated the Constitution in doing so. Judge Potter rejected this argument,\nas do we (and the dissent, in never mentioning it, apparently also\nrejects it). The Capacchione plaintiffs rely on inapposite case law in\nattempting to establish that Board actions taken pursuant to court-\nordered desegregation decrees can be held unconstitutional.\n\n   Specifically, they rely on recent decisions finding voluntary, race-\nconscious magnet school programs (not developed under a governing\ndesegregation order) unconstitutional. See Eisenberg v. Montgomery\nCounty Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 125 (4th Cir. 1999); Tuttle v.\nArlington County Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698 (4th Cir. 1999); see also\nWessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir. 1998). In fact, the courts\nemphasized in those cases that the school system had not been under\na court order to desegregate, see Eisenberg, 197 F.3d at 124, and had\nadopted a magnet program \"not to remedy past discrimination, but\nrather to promote racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity.\" Tuttle,\n195 F.3d at 700 (emphasis added); see also Wessman, 160 F.3d at 792\n(noting that prior to instituting its magnet program the school system\n\"had achieved unitariness in the area of student assignments\" and that\n\"the district court thereupon relinquished control over\" that area).\nIndeed, in Eisenberg we endorsed the permissibility of race-based\nclassifications \"in situations,\" like that at hand, \"where past constitu-\ntional violations require race-based remedial action.\" 197 F.3d at 130\n(citing Swann, 402 U.S. at 1); see also Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795.\n\n   The distinction between a unitary school system and a school sys-\ntem under court order to desegregate is, from a legal standpoint, fun-\ndamental. Furthermore, as discussed supra, it is the judicial finding\nof unitary status, not any particular action by the school board or con-\ndition in the school system, upon which the distinction turns. Of\ncourse, for a formerly segregated school system, the attainment of\nunitary status reflects years or decades of gradual change, not an over-\nnight shift in policy or outlook. Although CMS will not look much\ndifferent the day it becomes unitary than it will have looked the previ-\nous day, attainment of unitary status triggers significant legal conse-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    163\nquences. In a non-unitary school system, all one-race or\npredominantly one-race schools are presumed to be vestiges of segre-\ngation, and the burden is on the challenging party to show that those\nschools are nondiscriminatory. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 26 (\"The court\nshould scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the school\nauthorities will be to satisfy the court that their racial composition is\nnot the result of present or past discriminatory action on their part.\").\nOnce a court has declared a school system unitary, on the other hand,\nthe presumption is that the vestiges of segregation have been elimi-\nnated, and a plaintiff seeking to demonstrate a constitutional violation\non the basis of the existence of one-race or predominantly one-race\nschools must \"prove discriminatory intent on the part of the school\nboard.\" Riddick, 784 F.2d at 537.\n\n   As Judge Potter recognized, see Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at\n285, CMS implemented and administered its expanded magnet\nschools program prior to ever achieving unitary status and while still\nunder court order to remedy the vestiges of segregation. Therefore,\nrecent decisions, like Eisenberg and Tuttle, addressing the constitu-\ntionality of magnet school assignment policies in unitary school sys-\ntems not under court order, are simply inapposite.\n\n   Moreover, even if Tuttle and Eisenberg generally applied to gov-\nernmental acts performed pursuant to remedial desegregation orders\n(which they do not), the Board’s expanded magnet schools program\nwould withstand constitutional scrutiny. This is so because if a prece-\ndent of the Supreme Court \"has direct application in a case,\" inferior\ncourts must follow that precedent \"even if later cases appear to call\nit into question, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of\noverruling its own decisions.\" See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203,\n237 (1997).\n\n   There could hardly be a clearer case for application of this princi-\nple. Here, the Supreme Court’s Swann decision itself constitutes\ndirectly controlling precedent. In Swann, the Court concluded that\nCMS could be constitutionally required to make efforts \"to reach a\n71-29 ratio\" in the schools under its authority, and to assign students\n\"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at var-\nious grade levels have about the same proportion of black and white\nstudents.\" See 402 U.S. at 23-25 (approving Judge McMillan’s order).\n\f164     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nIndeed, the Supreme Court again noted in Freeman that its decision\nin Swann specifically approved racial balancing by CMS to achieve\nthe remedial end of eliminating the vestiges of segregation. 503 U.S.\nat 493 (In Swann, \"[w]e confirmed that racial balance in school\nassignments was a necessary part of the remedy in the circumstances\nthere presented.\"). Under the principle articulated in Agostini, only\nthe Supreme Court itself can modify the decrees in this case to pro-\nhibit what Swann so clearly permitted.\n\n                                   D.\n\n   The Supreme Court’s decision in Swann is the law of the case; it\nmust be followed. But more than just the law of this case, for almost\nthirty years Swann also has functioned as a blueprint for school\ndesegregation in school districts throughout this Nation. As long as\nSwann is controlling law, and as long as the Board acts pursuant to\nthe Swann desegregation orders — as it did in implementing the\nexpanded magnet schools program — it cannot be held to have vio-\nlated the Constitution.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   Judge Potter also enjoined CMS from \"assigning children to\nschools or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through\nrace-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other means that deny\nstudents an equal footing based on race.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp.\n2d at 294. In considering the propriety of an injunction, we review\nfactual findings only for clear error, but the \"district court’s applica-\ntion of legal principles . . . presents a legal question reviewed de\nnovo.\" North Carolina v. City of Virginia Beach, 951 F.2d 596, 601\n(4th Cir. 1992).\n\n    Given the Court’s holding today that CMS did not violate the con-\nstitutional rights of the Capacchione plaintiffs by consideration of\nrace in its expanded magnet schools program, and because we would\nalso hold that CMS has not yet achieved unitary status, there is, in our\nview, no legal basis for the district court’s injunction. Moreover, even\nif the district court properly determined that CMS had attained unitary\nstatus, the injunction still must be vacated. This is so because the dis-\ntrict court could issue an injunction only to the extent that it con-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    165\ncluded that CMS was likely to persist in current practices that would\nviolate the Constitution if undertaken outside of the remedial context.\nSee United States v. Oregon State Med. Soc’y, 343 U.S. 326, 333\n(1952). Judge Potter made no such finding.\n\n   Indeed, the only CMS action that Judge Potter held to violate the\nConstitution was the expanded magnet schools program (a holding\nthat this Court has now reversed); the judge did not consider the con-\nstitutionality of any other method of student assignment or resource\nallocation. Yet the injunction by its terms prohibits any consideration\nof race by CMS in student assignment or allocation of educational\nbenefits that \"den[ies] students an equal footing.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 294. The injunction thus goes much further than simply\nprohibiting CMS from reinstituting the expanded magnet schools pro-\ngram and its race-conscious assignment policy.\n\n   This court has repeatedly held similar injunctions too broad,\nexplaining that \"[a]lthough injunctive relief should be designed to\ngrant the relief needed to remedy the injury to the prevailing party,\nit should not go beyond the extent of the established violation.\"\nHayes, 10 F.3d at 217; see also Tuttle, 195 F.3d at 708. Similarly, the\nSupreme Court has directed \"[f]ederal court decrees must directly\naddress and relate to the constitutional violation itself.\" Milliken, 433\nU.S. at 282. Because the injunction issued in this case did not do this,\nit must be vacated.\n\n                                   V.\n\n   In addition to injunctive relief, the district court awarded nominal\ndamages of one dollar to the Capacchione plaintiffs \"to vindicate the\nconstitutional rights of children denied an equal footing in applying\nto magnet schools.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. Because a\nmajority of the Court holds that the expanded magnet schools pro-\ngram did not violate the Constitution, it follows that the nominal dam-\nages award must also be vacated.\n\n                                  VI.\n\n  The district court awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs\n$1,499,016.47, plus interest, in attorney’s fees, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\f166        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n§ 1988 (1994). See Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schs., 80\nF. Supp. 2d 557 (W.D.N.C. 1999) (amended by orders of December\n16, 1999, J.A. 1313-15, and March 6, 2000, J.A. 1356-62). Under\n§ 1988, a court is only permitted to award fees when a \"party, other\nthan the United States\" prevails in an \"action to enforce\" the Constitu-\ntion or specific federal civil rights statutes. 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Because\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs have not prevailed on any constitutional or\nother claim providing a basis for statutory attorney’s fees, the $1.49\nmillion fee award must be vacated in its entirety.\n\n   We note initially that this Court’s reversal of the district court’s\nfinding that CMS’s magnet schools program violates the Constitution\nobviously means that all attorney’s fees awarded in connection with\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs’ previous success on this issue must be\nvacated. The district court apparently based much of its attorney’s\nfees award on this ground. See Capacchione, 80 F. Supp. 2d. at 559\n(awarding attorney’s fees in part because the \"Court found for Plain-\ntiff Capacchione on the core of his claim that CMS violated Cristina\nCapacchione’s constitutional rights under the Equal Protection\nClause\") (emphasis added). Our Court today not only holds that CMS\ndid not violate the Capacchione plaintiffs’ constitutional rights in\nadopting the expanded magnet schools program, but also reverses and\nvacates the district court’s attendant orders for injunctive and mone-\ntary relief. As the Capacchione plaintiffs themselves recognize, it is\n\"self-evident\" that they cannot recover attorney’s fees \"if this Court\nreverses on the order appealed from.\" Brief of Appellees at 113 n.51.\nGiven the reversal of the magnet schools ruling, the award of attor-\nney’s fees attendant to it must be vacated.\n\n   The dissent maintains, however, that because this Court has also\nupheld Judge Potter’s unitary status ruling, the Capacchione plaintiffs\nare entitled to an award of some attorney’s fees. See Traxler Op. at\n66.28 Our Court properly rejects this notion because the unitary status\n  28\n    Contrary to the dissent’s contentions, CMS did not concede that if\nthe Grant intervenors obtained only a declaration of unitary status, with-\nout an injunction or determination that CMS violated the Constitution,\nthey would be entitled to attorney’s fees. CMS actually stated:\n       Unlike Capacchione, the Grant intervenors were granted declara-\n       tory and injunctive relief related to the issues of unitary status\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     167\ndetermination alone simply provides no basis for an award of attor-\nney’s fees. See also Wilkinson Op. at 72 & n.1.\n\n   Just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court removed all doubt in this\narea. In Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dept. of\nHealth and Human Res., ___ U.S. ___, ___, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 1839\n(2001), the Court reiterated that \"[i]n the United States, parties are\nordinarily required to bear their own attorney’s fees — the prevailing\nparty is not entitled to collect from the loser.\" In accord with the tradi-\ntional \"American Rule,\" courts may not award attorney’s fees to the\nprevailing party absent explicit statutory authority. See id. (citing Key\nTronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 819 (1994)). Indeed, in\nBuckhannon, the Supreme Court noted that statutory authority to\naward attorney’s fees is critical, for \"Congress ha[s] not ‘extended\nany roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or\notherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted.’\" Buck-\nhannon, 121 S. Ct at 1843 (quoting Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wil-\nderness Soc’y, 421 U.S. 240, 260 (1975)).\n\n   In this case, there is simply no statutory basis for an award of fees\nto the Capacchione plaintiffs on the sole issue on which they have\nprevailed, namely the unitary status determination. Although a major-\nity of this Court has regrettably, and we believe mistakenly, deter-\nmined that CMS has attained unitary status, no member of the Court\nsuggests that in doing so, or in not doing so sooner, CMS violated 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 2000d, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Con-\nstitution, or any other law or constitutional provision that would give\nrise to an award of attorney’s fees under § 1988 or any other statute.29\n\n      and CMS’ magnet school admission policies. Therefore, the enti-\n      tlement of the Grant intervenors to recover attorneys’ fees is tied\n      directly to the merits of those claims.\nBrief of Appellants at 40 (emphasized language omitted in dissent, see\nTraxler Op. at 66). Of course, no plaintiff prevailed on the claim that the\n\"magnet school admission policies\" violated the Constitution, or any\nother claim that provided a statutory basis for attorney’s fees. Moreover,\neven if CMS had conceded to the contrary, there would be no basis for\na fee award.\n   29\n      We note that if CMS itself had succeeded in simply obtaining a dec-\nlaration that its school system was now unitary, no one would contend\nthat the Board would be entitled to an award of fees. Given this, how can\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs, operating as a \"private attorneys general\" on\nbehalf of the Board, Traxler Op. at 68, be entitled to fees?\n\f168     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nWhile some of the Capacchione plaintiffs had alleged that CMS’s\nfailure to obtain a declaration that it had attained unitary status vio-\nlated their constitutional rights, Judge Potter never so held. Tellingly,\non appeal, the Capacchione plaintiffs do not assert this position, let\nalone offer any support for it. Nor does any member of this Court\nembrace this unprecedented theory. Thus, there is no basis for an\naward of attorney’s fees here.\n\n   We note that, even if § 1988 somehow applied to a mere finding\nof unitary status, absent some additional finding of a constitutional or\ncivil rights violation, the Capacchione plaintiffs would still not be\nentitled to attorney’s fees because they do not qualify as \"prevailing\npart[ies].\" In order to be a \"prevailing party,\" a party seeking fees\nmust have obtained \"an enforceable judgment . . . consent decree or\nsettlement.\" Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111 (1992). Additionally,\nthere must be some defendant in the case who has been \"prevailed\nagainst,\" id. at 109, with a resulting \"material alteration of the legal\nrelationship\" between that defendant and the party seeking fees, id. at\n111.\n\n   This prevailing party requirement is crucial: in Buckhannon, the\nSupreme Court rejected the so-called \"catalyst theory\" of attorney’s\nfees on the ground that it might permit an award \"where there is no\njudicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\"\nBuckhannon, 121 S. Ct. at 1840. By simply obtaining a declaration\nthat the Board has achieved unitary status, the Capacchione plaintiffs\nhave not obtained \"an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settle-\nment;\" they have not \"prevailed against\" CMS; nor have they effected\na \"material alteration of the legal relationship\" between the parties.\n\n   Indeed, the declaration of unitary status merely restores the parties\nto the status quo prior to the issuance of the desegregation decree.\nSuch a declaration does not constitute \"an enforceable judgment\" for\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs. The dissent is mistaken in its assertion\nthat a unitary status declaration is \"enforceable against CMS in the\nunlikely event it later attempts to continue prior assignment policies.\"\nTraxler Op. at 68. Any challenge to future race-based assignment pol-\nicies would be on the ground that they violate the Constitution, not\nthat they violate a declaration of unitary status. Thus, a future chal-\nlenge would seek to \"enforce\" the Constitution, not the unitary status\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     169\ndetermination. This point highlights the heart of the dissent’s misun-\nderstanding. Section 1988 exists to provide attorney’s fees for those\nplaintiffs who demonstrate that they suffered deprivations of rights\nunder federal civil rights laws or the Constitution. Today, a majority\nof this Court has held that the Capacchione plaintiffs have suffered\nno such deprivation; thus, they are not entitled to statutory attorney’s\nfees.\n\n   Although the declaration of unitary status represents a rejection of\nthe legal position that CMS has taken in this litigation, such a defeat\nis not tantamount to being \"prevailed against\" under § 1988. See\nBuckhannon, 121 S. Ct. at 1841 (\"We cannot agree that the term ‘pre-\nvailing party’ authorizes federal courts to award attorney’s fees to a\nplaintiff who . . . has reached the ‘sought-after destination’ without\nobtaining any judicial relief.\"). Rather, the primary significance of a\ndeclaration of unitary status is that CMS has been successful; it has\neradicated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable\nand, as the Capacchione plaintiffs put it, obtained a \"return of control\nto local authorities.\" Brief of Appellees at 34. The Board, upon a dec-\nlaration of unitariness, now actually has wider latitude to assign stu-\ndents than it did while it was under court order to remedy past\ndiscrimination (although certain race-conscious policies might no lon-\nger be permissible). Accordingly, this declaration of Board success,\nand attendant broadening of the Board’s discretion, does not consti-\ntute an alteration of the parties’ legal relationship \"in a way that\ndirectly benefits the plaintiff.\" Farrar, 506 U.S. at 112 (emphasis\nadded). Without more, the declaration that CMS has achieved unitary\nstatus does not place any direct benefit on the Capacchione plaintiffs,\nwho \"obtain[ ] nothing from the defendants.\" Hewitt v. Helms, 482\nU.S. 755, 761-62 (1987).30\n  30\n     The dissent’s contention that the Capacchione plaintiffs helped \"in\nmaking unitariness a reality\" underscores the dissent’s confusion as to\nthe difference between seeking injunctive relief to eliminate illegal seg-\nregation connected with a dual school system with a declaration that this\nhas been done. The former is an action to \"enforce\" civil rights laws and\nthe Constitution — and therefore contemplated by § 1988 — and the lat-\nter is a statement that earlier enforcement efforts have succeeded for rea-\nsons having nothing to do with the Capacchione plaintiffs’ lawsuit.\n\f170    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   Moreover, \"only those changes in a defendant’s conduct which are\nmandated by a judgment . . . in the case at bar may be considered by\nthe court in determining the plaintiff’s success at trial\" for purposes\nof attorney’s fees under § 1988. Clark v. Sims, 28 F.3d 400, 425 (4th\nCir. 1994) (emphasis added). In affirming the district court’s unitary\nstatus determination, this Court does not mandate that CMS engage\nin any \"conduct\" whatsoever, but simply holds that \"CMS has com-\nplied in good faith with the mandate of Brown,\" and that the \"dual\nsystem has been dismantled.\" Traxler Op. at 43. By vacating the\naward of nominal damages and injunctive relief, this Court has\nremoved any \"mandate\" on the actions of the district court. Having\nbeen determined to be unitary, CMS is now free to take whatever\naction it wishes consistent with the Constitution.\n\n   Thus, the Capacchione plaintiffs’ suit seeking a declaration of uni-\ntary status was not an \"action to enforce\" the civil rights laws under\n§ 1988. Rather, these plaintiffs sought a declaration that CMS has\ncomplied with judgments obtained by the Swann plaintiffs in previous\nactions to enforce civil rights. Although the Capacchione plaintiffs\nbrought separate § 1983 claims asserting that the expanded magnet\nschools program violated the Equal Protection Clause, they have not\n\"prevail[ed]\" on those claims.\n\n   In sum, not only is there no statutory authority to award attorney’s\nfees here, but even if such authority were present, the Capacchione\nplaintiffs are not prevailing parties under § 1988. For these reasons,\nthere is no basis for an award of any attorney’s fees in this case.\n\n                                 VII.\n\n   Finally, CMS appeals the district court’s order awarding sanctions\n— including legal fees and costs — to the Capacchione plaintiffs\narising from a discovery dispute. In the months before trial, CMS did\nnot respond to interrogatories by the Capacchione plaintiffs seeking\ndisclosure of fact witnesses. Instead, the Board waited until the week\nbefore trial to reveal the names of most of its fact witnesses, provid-\ning the Capacchione plaintiffs with a list of 174 names which it ulti-\nmately narrowed to twenty-six potential witnesses. The Board\nmaintains that its actions complied with the district court’s pretrial\norder, which required the parties to provide a list of fact witnesses to\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    171\neach other \"[n]o later than the morning of the first day of trial.\" J.A.\n150.\n\n   The district court, however, granted the Capacchione plaintiffs’\nmotion for sanctions. The court held that it had established the rules\nfor disclosure of fact witnesses in an order of September 1998, which\nsuperseded the pretrial order. The September 1998 order denied the\nCapacchione plaintiffs’ motion to compel disclosure of witnesses\nprior to the date established in the pretrial order for disclosure of\nexpert witnesses, but the court stated that \"CMS must supplement its\nresponses, as it promised, when such information becomes known.\"\nJ.A. 195. In awarding sanctions, the district court also indicated its\nconcern that CMS had been \"lacking candor in disclosing relevant\nand important information\" during the pretrial stage, that the disclo-\nsure of a list of 174 potential witnesses in the week before trial was\n\"extremely prejudicial to opposing counsel,\" and that many of the\nwitnesses on the list may have been \"irrelevant or unnecessarily\ncumulative.\" J.A. 305. As a result, the district court ordered a one-\nweek recess after the Capacchione plaintiffs’ presentation at trial to\nallow them to depose, at the school system’s expense, any of the\ntwenty-six witnesses on the Board’s revised list. Witnesses whom the\nBoard did not make available for deposition or interview during the\nmid-trial recess were barred from testifying.\n\n   \"Rule 37(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gives the dis-\ntrict court wide discretion to impose sanctions for a party’s failure to\ncomply with its discovery orders.\" Mutual Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v.\nRichards & Ass’ns., Inc., 872 F.2d 88, 92 (4th Cir. 1989). CMS could\nplausibly have understood the deadline for disclosure of fact wit-\nnesses contained in the pretrial order to have continued in effect after\nthe subsequent September 1998 order given that the subsequent\norder’s central effect was to reaffirm the deadline contained in the\npretrial order for disclosure of expert witnesses. Nonetheless, we can-\nnot say that the district court abused its broad discretion in finding\nthat its September 1998 order did in fact supersede the pretrial order,\nand that the Board’s pretrial conduct had been unnecessarily dilatory\nand prejudicial to the Capacchione plaintiffs. Therefore the order of\nsanctions against CMS must be affirmed.\n\f172     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                                  VIII.\n\n   We must and do sympathize with those who are impatient with\ncontinued federal court involvement in the operation of local schools.\nOne might consider thirty-five years a long time for a school district\nto operate under judicial desegregation decrees. However, when the\nSupreme Court decided Swann in 1971 no one could reasonably have\nthought that the substantial task described there would be quickly or\neasily accomplished. CMS, which maintained a separate, decidedly\nunequal dual educational system for decades — and which mightily\nresisted desegregation of any sort for years after it became the law of\nthe land — has come a long way. Although CMS has now achieved\nunitary status in certain respects, the record in this case simply does\nnot support a determination that the process of desegregation is at an\nend.\n\n   For more than a hundred years, in fits and starts, our nation has\nattempted to undo the effects of its shameful heritage of slavery. For\nnearly fifty years, federal courts have struggled with the task of dis-\nmantling legally enforced racial segregation in many of our schools.\nThis task has given rise to one of the preeminent issues of constitu-\ntional law in our time. We do not yet know how history will regard\nthe courts’ role in adjudicating and presiding over the desegregation\nof schools. It may be seen as a brief and unfortunate jurisprudential\nanomaly, justified only by the immediacy of the evil it was intended\nto uproot, cf. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 505-07 (Scalia, J., concurring); or\nit may be recognized as the necessarily sustained effort to eradicate\ndeep-seated vestiges of racial discrimination and to vindicate the\npromise of the Fourteenth Amendment, cf. Dowell, 498 U.S. at 266-\n68 (Marshall, J., dissenting); or it may be viewed in some other way\nthat we cannot now anticipate.\n\n   But we are certain that the end of this great task must be accom-\nplished in an orderly manner, consistent with and true to its origin.\nWe are certain, too, that if the courts, at some point, come to view the\neffort to eliminate the vestiges of segregation as having been overly\n\"race-conscious,\" they must do so with a clear assessment of the his-\ntorical record.\n\n   Race neutrality, of course, represents one of our constitutional\nideals. Properly understood, it is an ideal not at all in tension with our\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    173\nobligation as a society to undo the effects of slavery and of the racial\ncaste system that was perpetuated, for more than a century, in slav-\nery’s wake. But we must be ever mindful, as we strive for race neu-\ntrality, that a reductive and willfully ahistorical conception of race\nneutrality was, in an earlier era, used as a blunt instrument against the\naspirations of African-Americans merely seeking to claim entitlement\nto full citizenship.\n\n   In striking down early civil rights legislation, the Supreme Court\nembraced this misconceived race neutrality, reasoning, only twenty\nyears after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, that the\nlegislation at issue would illegitimately make black citizens \"the spe-\ncial favorite of the laws.\" Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 25 (1883).\nIndeed, the system of segregation with which we are concerned was\njustified at its inception by a particular conception of race neutrality\n— that a regime of racial separation could be constitutionally justified\nso long as it applied neutrally and equally to persons of all races. See\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 551 (1896) (\"We consider the\nunderlying fallacy of the plaintiff’s argument to consist in the\nassumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the\ncolored race with a badge of inferiority.\").\n\n   The first Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy, declared our Consti-\ntution to be \"color-blind,\" id., 163 U.S. at 559, and in doing so pro-\nvided one of the most famous and compelling articulations of the\nconstitutional guarantee of equality. But in urging us to be \"blind\" to\nrace, Justice Harlan did not, as is sometimes suggested, suggest that\nwe be ignorant of it. In Plessy, he was the only member of the Court\nwilling to acknowledge the most obvious truth about segregation:\n\"Everyone knows that the statute in question had its origin in the pur-\npose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occu-\npied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied\nor assigned to white persons.\" Id. at 557. Thirteen years earlier, dis-\nsenting in the Civil Rights Cases, Justice Harlan rejected the notion\nthat civil rights legislation made blacks a \"special favorite of the\nlaws,\" id., 109 U.S. at 61, and he criticized the majority’s reasoning\nas \"narrow and artificial.\" Id. at 26.\n\n   We recognize now, as Justice Harlan recognized then, that no sim-\nple syllogism can enfold all of history’s burdens and complexities.\n\f174     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nEliminating race-consciousness from government decision making\nmust be regarded as among our worthiest constitutional aspirations.\nBut that aspiration surely cannot be so rigid that it refuses to distin-\nguish the \"race consciousness\" that created a segregated school sys-\ntem and the race-conscious efforts necessary to eliminate that system.\nWhile most judges are not historians, we must be willing to acknowl-\nedge and confront our history. If we fail to do so, we risk falling into\na mode that equates the cure with the disease: civil rights with favorit-\nism, desegregation with segregation. As American citizens, we know\nbetter.\n\n   We are honored to state that Judge Michael and Judge Gregory join\nin this opinion.\n\f",

The parties presented a number of issues for our consideration,\nincluding whether the district court erred in (l) finding that unitary\nstatus had been achieved and awarding attorneys’ fees to plaintiff-\nintervenors based on this finding; (2) holding that the establishment\nof a magnet schools program was an ultra vires, unconstitutional act\njustifying an award of nominal damages and attorneys’ fees; (3)\nenjoining the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board from considering\nrace in the future assignment of students or allocation of educational\nresources; and (4) sanctioning the Board for failing to comply with\nthe district court’s discovery order.\n\n   Having considered the briefs and arguments of the parties, a major-\nity of the Court holds: (1) by a 7-4 vote (Chief Judge Wilkinson and\nJudges Widener, Wilkins, Niemeyer, Luttig, Williams and Traxler in\nthe affirmative), the school system has achieved unitary status, but by\na 6-5 vote (Chief Judge Wilkinson and Judges Niemeyer, Michael,\nMotz, King and Gregory in the affirmative) attorneys’ fees for work\ndone on the unitary status issue are denied; (2) by a 6-5 vote (Chief\nJudge Wilkinson and Judges Niemeyer, Michael, Motz, King, and\nGregory in the affirmative), the Board did not forfeit its immunity for\nthe establishment of the magnet schools program, and nominal dam-\nages and attorneys’ fees in that regard are denied; (3) by a unanimous\nvote, the injunction is vacated; and (4) by a unanimous vote, the\nimposition of sanctions is affirmed.\n\n   The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed on the find-\ning of unitary status and the imposition of sanctions, reversed as to\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      7\nthe finding of liability for nominal damages for the establishment of\nthe magnet schools program, reversed as to the imposition of attor-\nneys’ fees for any reason, and reversed on the issuance of the injunc-\ntion.\n\n   Unitary status having been achieved, the judgment of the district\ncourt vacating and dissolving all prior injunctive orders and decrees\nis affirmed. The Board is to operate the school system without the\nstrictures of these decrees no later than the 2002-2003 school year.\n\n                   AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\n\nTRAXLER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   This case is hopefully the final chapter in the saga of federal court\ncontrol over the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (\"CMS\"). Since\n1971 CMS has operated under a federally supervised desegregation\nplan that included limited use of racial ratios, pairing and grouping of\nschool zones, and extensive busing. So successful was the plan that\nthe district court removed the case from the active docket in 1975,\nexpressing its belief that the once reluctant school board was commit-\nted to achieving desegregation and was already well on the way\ntoward a unitary school system. Since then, two generations of stu-\ndents have passed through CMS and, until the present case, not one\nperson has returned to court alleging that segregative practices have\nbeen continued or revived.\n\n   Now, nearly three decades later and prompted by a lawsuit filed by\na white student challenging the magnet schools admissions policy, the\nquestion of whether CMS has achieved unitary status has been placed\nbefore our courts. In 1999, the district court, after a lengthy hearing\nand searching inquiry, concluded that CMS had indeed achieved uni-\ntary status by eliminating the vestiges of past discrimination to the\nextent practicable. This conclusion was not reached in haste; it was\nthe result of a two-month hearing and an examination of extensive\ntestimony and evidence relating to every aspect of CMS’s educational\nsystem.\n\n   A majority of this court now affirms the district court’s holding on\nthis issue, satisfied that CMS has dismantled the dual school system.\n\f8       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nIn sharp contrast to the situation in the late 1960s, when black stu-\ndents were segregated in black schools and taught by a predominantly\nblack staff, CMS students today are educated in an integrated envi-\nronment by an integrated faculty. Nor do we turn over control to an\nindecisive and uncommitted school board. CMS currently operates\nunder the firm guidance of an integrated school board which has\nclearly demonstrated its commitment to a desegregated school sys-\ntem.\n\n   In sum, the \"end purpose\" of federal intervention to remedy segre-\ngation has been served, and it is time to complete the task with which\nwe were charged—to show confidence in those who have achieved\nthis success and to restore to state and local authorities the control of\ntheir school system. Consequently, a majority of this court affirms the\ndistrict court’s unitary status determination.\n\n   However, while a majority of my colleagues agree that CMS has\nachieved unitary status, and have graciously joined me on this point,\nI respectfully depart from a separate majority’s decision to reverse the\ndistrict court’s holding that CMS’s magnet schools program, which\nwas implemented in 1992, was an ultra vires, unconstitutional act jus-\ntifying an award of nominal damages and attorney fees. By denying\nchildren, on account of their race, an equal opportunity to compete for\nopen, unclaimed slots in CMS’s extraordinary magnet program, I\nbelieve the school board pushed too far and did more than either was\nrequired or permitted. Just as the educational process of the 1960s\nunconstitutionally deprived black children of educational opportuni-\nties solely on account of their race, the magnet schools admissions\npolicy deprives white children of educational opportunities solely on\naccount of their race. Consequently, I depart from the separate major-\nity in that I would affirm the district court’s conclusion that the mag-\nnet schools program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment and the liability of the school board for the\nviolation.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   In 1896, the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana statute \"providing\nfor separate railway carriages for the white and colored races.\" Plessy\nv.

The Plessy majority charac-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      9\nterized the statute as \"not necessarily imply[ing] the inferiority of\neither race,\" id. at 544, but the first Justice Harlan, in dissent, aptly\ndescribed the true aim of the law: \"Everyone knows that the statute\nin question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white\npersons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored\npeople from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons,\" id.\nat 557 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan further \"den[ied] that\nany legislative body or judicial tribunal may have regard to the race\nof citizens when the civil rights of those citizens are involved.\" Id. at\n554-55 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Unfortunately, the principle of \"sepa-\nrate but equal\" reached much farther than Louisiana railways, and was\napplied to other public services, including education. The march of\nprogress eventually proved the correctness of Justice Harlan’s princi-\npled stand. Segregation, in all of its manifestations, was \"arbitrary\"\nand \"wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality\nbefore the law established by the Constitution.\" Id. at 561-62 (Harlan,\nJ., dissenting).\n\n   Early efforts aimed at combating the injustice wrought by Plessy\nin educational settings often centered on state-funded graduate and\nprofessional schools.

Mis-\nsouri had no \"separate but equal\" law school for its African-American\ncitizens and instead offered to pay Gaines’ tuition and expenses for\na legal education in another state. The Supreme Court held that Mis-\nsouri’s offer denied Gaines equal protection of the laws. The Court\nobserved that \"[t]he admissibility of laws separating the races in the\nenjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the\nequality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups\nwithin the State.\" Gaines, 305 U.S. at 349. Though providing only\nsmall victories, cases like Gaines exposed \"separate but equal\" for the\nuntenable proposition that it was.\n\n   In 1954, the Supreme Court recognized the futility of measuring\nequality in segregated facilities.

See id. at 797-98. Two months later, the\nSupreme Court granted certiorari and undertook an in-depth review\nof the power of the federal district courts to craft such sweeping\ndesegregation remedies. See Swann v.

First, the Court addressed\nthe issue of the district court’s use of racial ratios. While the Supreme\nCourt approved of a limited use of mathematical ratios in a plan\ncrafted by a district court, it emphasized that such ratios were \"a start-\ning point . . . rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 25. The\nCourt reminded district courts that \"[t]he constitutional command to\ndesegregate schools does not mean that every school in every commu-\nnity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system\nas a whole.\" Id. at 24. Second, the Court dealt with single-race\nschools. Though the Court concluded that schools consisting of pre-\ndominantly one race were not per se unconstitutional, the Court\ninstructed the district courts to utilize \"close scrutiny to determine that\nschool assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation.\" Id. at\n26. Third, the Court considered alterations of attendance zones. The\nCourt held \"that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school\nzones is a permissible tool,\" id. at 28, but declined to craft \"rigid\nrules\" in light of differing local circumstances, id. at 29. Finally, the\nCourt tackled the busing issue.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     13\nmit the substitution of a \"feeder plan\" whereby schools would draw\npupils from designated attendance areas in an effort to keep children\ntogether for their entire public school career.

Cit-\ning concerns of resegregation and the placement of additional burdens\non African-American children, the district court questioned the feeder\nplan. See id. at 1350-53. CMS then withdrew its original feeder plan\nand began work on a modified version. See id. at 1353. The district\ncourt eventually approved a revised feeder plan that reopened several\nformer black schools and prevented over- and under-utilization of\nfacilities. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 334 F.\nSupp. 623 (W.D.N.C. 1971).\n\n   However, within just two years it became clear that CMS’s revised\nfeeder plan was inadequate \"for dealing with foreseeable problems\"\nin the dismantling of the dual system.

See Swann v.

The\nplan was designed by a citizens advisory group working with the\nboard in an effort to reach \"an acceptable consensus\" on school deseg-\nregation in CMS. Id. at 1103. The plan’s most promising features\nwere the avoidance of any majority black schools (with the exception\nof Hidden Valley, an exempted school), and a more equal distribution\nof the busing burden. See id. at 1105 1110. Praising the board for\nmaking \"a clean break with the essentially ‘reluctant’ attitude which\ndominated Board actions for many years,\" the district court predicted\nthat the policies and positive attitude would eventually result in a uni-\ntary school system. Id. at 1103.\n\n   The district court closed Swann in 1975 and removed the case from\nthe active docket. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,\n\f14      BELK v.

See id.\n\n   For three years there was no action in the case. This changed in\n1978 when a group of white parents sought to enjoin CMS from reas-\nsigning over 4000 students in an effort to maintain racial balance in\ncertain schools. See Martin v.

The parents attacking the 1978\nstudent assignment plan \"offered no live evidence but offered and\nrelied upon a few written exhibits and admissions from the plead-\nings.\" Id. at 1321. Not surprisingly, the district court rejected the par-\nents’ challenge to the student assignment plan and praised CMS for\nits zeal in dismantling the dual system.\n\n   In 1980, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs again returned to the dis-\ntrict court. The parties informed the district court that the African-\nAmerican student population in CMS’s elementary schools had grown\nfrom twenty-nine percent to forty percent, making it difficult to avoid\npredominantly black student bodies. To provide the board with some\nflexibility, the district court permitted operation of elementary schools\nwith African-American student bodies of plus fifteen percent above\nthe district-wide average. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., No. 1974 (W.D.N.C. Apr. 17, 1980).\n\n   Since 1980, neither the board nor the Swann plaintiffs have\napproached the district court regarding alteration of the earlier deseg-\nregation orders. And, until the present litigation, the Swann plaintiffs\nhave never attempted to reopen the case in order to address any\nalleged failure by the board to comply with the district court’s deseg-\nregation orders.\n\n   The controversy before us today arose in September 1997 when\nWilliam Capacchione (\"Capacchione\") filed suit against CMS on\nbehalf of his daughter, Cristina, alleging that she had been unconstitu-\ntionally denied admission to a magnet school program on account of\nher race. In 1992, without prior court approval, CMS had adopted a\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      15\ndesegregation plan focused mainly on the use of magnet schools. In\nfilling magnet schools, CMS had instituted a black and a non-black\nlottery to achieve racial balance. If a sufficient number of blacks or\nwhites did not apply and fill the seats allotted to their respective races,\nthen CMS would actively recruit children of the desired race despite\nlengthy waiting lists made up of children of the other race. If the\nrecruitment drive failed, CMS usually left the available slots vacant.\nCristina, who is white, was placed on a waiting list and eventually\ndenied admission to a program at the Olde Providence magnet school,\nwhich CMS marketed as \"a school to benefit everyone.\" J.A. XXXII-\n15,670.\n\n   The original Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann and to\nconsolidate it with Capacchione’s suit. They asserted that the vestiges\nof the dual school system had not been abolished and that the use of\nrace in the magnet admissions policy was necessary for the school\ndistrict to comply with the prior desegregation orders. The district\ncourt granted the motion and later permitted Capacchione to intervene\nin the Swann litigation. Seeking a finding that CMS had eradicated\nthe vestiges of past discrimination, another group of parents, led by\nMichael P. Grant (\"Grant\"),1 was also permitted to intervene in the lit-\nigation.\n\n   After a two-month bench trial, the district court determined that\nCMS had achieved unitary status, that the race-based admissions pol-\nicy for CMS’s magnet schools fell outside prior orders and was not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest, and that an\ninjunction was warranted. The district court \"enjoin[ed] CMS from\nany further use of race-based lotteries, preferences, and set-asides in\nstudent assignment.\" Capacchione v.

Student Assignment\n\n   Student assignment is perhaps the most critical Green factor\nbecause state-mandated separation of pupils on the basis of race is the\nessence of the dual system. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474 (observing\nthat the issue of student assignment is \"fundamental\" because \"under\nthe former de jure regimes racial exclusion was both the means and\nthe end of a policy motivated by disparagement of . . . the disfavored\nrace\"). To determine whether a school was racially balanced or imbal-\nanced, the district court adopted a plus/minus fifteen percent variance\nfrom the district-wide ratio of black to white students. See Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Considering that the only variance ever approved by\nthe district court in the course of the Swann litigation was a \"‘plus\n15%’ from the district-wide average,\" id. at 245, the addition of a\nminus fifteen percent is reasonable. Moreover, the Supreme Court has\npermitted a \"limited use . . . of mathematical ratios\" by district courts,\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 25, and much higher variances have been used to\ndefine desegregation, see Manning v.

CMS’s Compliance Record\n\n   The district court began by observing that since 1970, of the 126\nschools in operation, \"only twenty schools (16%) have had black stu-\ndent bodies higher than 15% above the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years, and only seventeen schools (13%) have had black\nstudent bodies lower than 15% below the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In addition, the district court found that CMS has not operated\na single-race school since 1970. See id.\n\n  The district court also turned to two desegregation indices: the dis-\nsimilarity index and the index of interracial exposure. The former\n\"measures the degree of racial imbalance, and it is derived by com-\nparing the racial composition of each school to the districtwide com-\nposition,\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172, and the latter measures \"the average\npercent white in schools attended by black students, weighted by the\nproportion of black students in each school.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172.\nAccording to the report of the plaintiff-intervenors’ expert witness,\nDr. David J. Armor, a dissimilarity value of twenty or below signifies\n  2\n   At trial, Dr. Eric Smith, the current superintendent of CMS, testified\nthat unitary status depended on every school being in balance. See J.A.\nXV-7187 & 7239. This is not the law. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 24 (\"The\nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of\nthe school system as a whole.\").\n   We find equally erroneous the Swann plaintiffs’ assertion at appellate\nargument before the panel that \"[t]he issue of how many schools are bal-\nanced has never been a question in this case.\" App. Tr. 91. The racial\ncomposition of schools goes to the heart of a desegregation case, and is\nvery much key to a review of the district court’s declaration of unitary\nstatus. See Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (ordering CMS to assign pupils\n\"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various\ngrade levels have about the same proportion of black and white stu-\ndents\").\n\f20     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\n\"a highly balanced school system\" and a score under thirty signifies\n\"a substantially desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172. CMS’s\ndissimilarity score was sixteen in 1980 and twenty-six in 1995. From\nthis it is clear that CMS quickly desegregated in the 1970s and contin-\nues to maintain a \"substantially desegregated system.\" The dissimilar-\nity index also indicates that CMS has better racial balance than\nseveral comparable districts did when they were declared unitary. See\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,173.\n   The index of interracial exposure, like the dissimilarity index,\nshows that CMS has made great leaps of progress. A score of zero on\nthe exposure index signifies total segregation, while a score of fifty\nor above indicates a \"highly desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,172. Schools in CMS typically score above fifty, whereas before\nthe desegregation order the schools’ scores hovered near twenty or\nbelow. See J.A. XXXIII-16,194-96.\n   CMS and the Swann plaintiffs correctly point out that the data sug-\ngest that in recent years racial imbalance has increased in some\nschools. Aware of this trend, the district court made a number of find-\nings on growth and demographic change in the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg area. The most revealing findings are as follows:\n     • the county population has increased from 354,656 in\n       1970 to 613,310 in 1997\n     • in 1970 the school district was the forty-third largest in\n       the nation and is today the twenty-third largest\n     • among cities with more than 500,000 people, Charlotte\n       ranks second in population growth in the 1990s\n     • the racial composition of the county has changed from\n       seventy-six percent white and twenty-four percent black\n       in 1970 to sixty-eight percent white, twenty-seven per-\n       cent black, and five percent other in 1997\n     • the current racial composition of schoolchildren is fifty\n       percent white, forty-two percent black, and eight percent\n       other\n     • as the county has become more suburban the inner city\n       and nearby suburbs have lost large numbers of white res-\n\f        BELK v.

These findings are sup-\nported by the report of the plaintiff-intervenors’ expert in demograph-\nics, Dr. William Clark. See J.A. XXXIII-16230-306. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court concluded that \"[t]here can be no doubt that demography\nand geography have played the largest role in causing imbalance.\"\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Dr. Murphy\ntestified that when he assumed his duties he \"was quite concerned\nabout the increasing difficulty in bringing about racial balance . . .\nbecause of the demographic shifts that were occurring.\" J.A. VI-2712.\nPopulation growth translated into more automobiles on the road, mak-\ning increased busing impracticable because \"the travel time to move\nyoungsters from the suburbs into the city with the flow of rush hour\ntraffic was a problem.\" J.A. VI-2732. In the fall of 1991, CMS hired\nDr. Michael J. Stolee to examine the problem and offer solutions. Dr.\nStolee also concluded that CMS’s task \"has been complicated by pop-\nulation growth,\" J.A. XXXII-15,571, and he recommended the adop-\ntion of a magnet schools program, which CMS promptly\nimplemented.\n   The Supreme Court has dealt with similar population growth and\nshifting demographics in the context of unitary status. In Freeman,\nthe court unequivocally stated that \"racial imbalance . . . [is] not tanta-\nmount to a showing that the school district [is] in noncompliance with\nthe decree or with its duties under the law.\" 503 U.S. at 494. Brown\nI, of course, does not mandate that racial balance be pursued in perpe-\ntuity. Once the original racial imbalance caused by a constitutional\nviolation has been rectified, \"the school district is under no duty to\nremedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.\" Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 494.\n\f22      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\n   The Swann plaintiffs contend that consideration of demographics\nand the rationale of Freeman are misplaced because the growth and\nshifting demographics of DeKalb County, Georgia, the school district\nunder court order in Freeman, exceeded that of Charlotte-\nMecklenburg. While CMS’s growth rates and demographic shifts cer-\ntainly do not equal those experienced in DeKalb,3 we can find nothing\nin Freeman limiting its holding to the specific facts of DeKalb\nCounty or establishing DeKalb as the standard for measuring imbal-\nance caused by demographic factors. On the contrary, the opinion\nspeaks in general terms. The Supreme Court observed that in the\nUnited States \"it is inevitable that the demographic makeup of school\ndistricts, based as they are on political subdivisions such as counties\nand municipalities, may undergo rapid change.\" Id. at 495. Mobility,\nthe Court noted, \"is a distinct characteristic of our society.\" Id. at 494.\n   Similarly, the Swann plaintiffs contend that unlike DeKalb County,\nMecklenburg County has become more integrated as the black popu-\nlation has increased. This is simply not true. For example, a report\nprepared in 1992 by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Staff for\nChairman Arthur Griffin concluded that \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg con-\ntinues to be a city of segregated neighborhoods\" with \"[c]oncentra-\ntions of Black households . . . generally located in the central city.\"\nJ.A. XXI-10,485; see also J.A. XXVIII-13,803 (1992 student assign-\nment plan stating that \"housing across the county is not racially inte-\ngrated. Approximately 50% of all black students live within one\ndistrict, while only 10% of white students reside in that district.\");\nJ.A. XXII-10,575 (CMS report chronicling growth of the black popu-\nlation and decline of the white population in the inner city). Clearly,\nincreased housing integration is not necessarily a corollary of\nAfrican-American population growth. Hence, despite the Swann\nplaintiffs’ best efforts, Freeman cannot be distinguished into nothing-\nness, nor does the standard of review permit this court to reweigh the\nevidence of the changes in CMS.\n   We also note that when confronted with growing imbalance in cer-\ntain schools, the district court demanded cogent and supportable\n  3\n    For example, the population of DeKalb County grew from 70,000 in\n1950 to 450,000 in 1985, and the percentage of black students in the dis-\ntrict grew from 5.6 percent in 1969 to forty-seven percent in 1986. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 475.\n\f         BELK v.

Evidence presented at trial indicated that \"[o]f the 16 for-\nmer black schools that are still open, 13 are currently balanced and\nhave been desegregated for periods ranging from 22 to 28 years. Of\nthe 3 that currently exceed the +15% black variance, each has been\nbalanced for at least 22 years.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Interestingly, of\nthe seventy-two former white schools that are still open, fifteen are\nnow majority black and were in balance for periods of twelve to\ntwenty-five years. See J.A. XXXIII-16,176.\n\n   In addition, Dr. Armor examined the seventeen schools in CMS\nthat exceeded the plus fifteen percent variance for three or more years\nduring the last decade. See J.A. XXXIII-16,174-76.4 Sixteen of the\nseventeen were balanced for periods ranging from nineteen to twenty-\nsix years, with one school experiencing balance for sixteen years. To\nthe extent that CMS’s pupil reassignments could be assessed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that changes instituted by CMS were \"attempts to\nmaintain or restore racial balance in the face of overwhelming demo-\ngraphic growth and mobility.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Indeed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that imbalance had been reduced in several of the\nschools because CMS’s magnet program attracted white students\nfrom the outer reaches of the county.\n\n  4\n   Dr. Armor did not include the predominantly white schools in this\nanalysis on three grounds:\n      (1) the court order did not establish a minimum percent black\n      enrollment, (2) the half-dozen schools that have had low black\n      enrollment for the past three or more years and that were operat-\n      ing in 1972 have been racially balanced for at least ten years[,]\n      and (3) the demographic analysis of Dr. Clark shows that these\n      schools have become imbalanced or were opened imbalanced\n      because of the substantial white enrollment growth in the out-\n      skirts of the county.\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,174 (footnote omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 26\n(observing \"that the existence of some small number of one-race, or vir-\ntually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark\nof a system that still practices segregation by law\").\n\f24      BELK v.

The district court in Martin distinguished Spangler\nby observing that it was but a restatement of the Swann Court’s admo-\nnition about the use of racial quotas and that, unlike Pasadena City,\nCMS had not achieved racially neutral attendance patterns. See Mar-\ntin, 475 F. Supp. at 1340. As for the Bakke decision, the district court\npointed out that no student in CMS was denied \"an equal educational\nopportunity\" and that the admissions policy in Bakke was imple-\nmented \"against a backdrop devoid of specific judicial findings or\nadministrative acknowledgments of the prior segregated status of the\nschool system.\" Id. at 1345. Accordingly, the Martin court concluded\nthat CMS’s reassignment of students was \"within constitutional limits\nand should be upheld.\" Id. at 1321. The district court took pains to\nensure that its opinion would not be interpreted too broadly: \"This\norder simply upholds the actions of the 1978 Board against the attacks\nby the plaintiffs.\" Id. at 1347. In the course of the Martin opinion, the\ndistrict court observed that CMS had fallen short in four areas: con-\nstruction and location of facilities in parts of the county likely to\nenhance desegregation, placement of elementary and kindergarten\ngrades in schools throughout the county, monitoring of student trans-\nfers so as to prevent resegregation, and allocation of the burdens of\nbusing. See id. at 1328-29. However, the district court also noted that\nCMS had made great progress and that a return to the old system of\nsegregation \"has not tempted the present School Board, who are\nstanding fast in their endeavor to run the schools according to law\nwhile providing quality education.\" Id. at 1347.\n\n   In Capacchione, the district court correctly observed that \"Martin\nwas not a unitary status hearing,\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Capacchione court further observed that post-Martin\nchanges in Charlotte-Mecklenburg counseled looking at the \"concerns\n[of Martin] in a new light.\" Id. The district court’s interpretation of\nMartin is reasonable and in accord with the rule in this circuit that a\ndistrict court, as a continuous institution, is \"best able to interpret its\nown orders.\" Vaughns v.

Moreover, the Martin order was\nissued thirteen years before the Supreme Court made clear in Free-\nman that the affirmative measures mandated by Green are not meant\nto remedy \"private choices\" that lead to resegregation. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 495. The state of the law and the understanding of duties upon\nschool districts were far different when Martin was handed down.\nHence, a number of assertions in Martin cannot be squared with the\npresent state of the law. See, e.g., Martin 475 F. Supp. at 1346 (stating\nthat segregated housing patterns must necessarily lead to the unconsti-\ntutional segregation of schools). Ignoring the changes in Charlotte-\nMecklenburg and in the law by erecting Martin as the framework for\nunitary status, as the Swann plaintiffs urged below, would defy com-\nmon sense and run afoul of developments in the Supreme Court’s\nschool desegregation jurisprudence. See United States Gypsum Co. v.\nSchiavo Bros., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398662\"><a href=\"/opinion/398662/united-states-gypsum-company-appellantcross-appellee-v-schiavo-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (3d Cir. 1981) (concluding that a\nsuccessor judge \"is empowered to reconsider [the legal conclusions of\nan unavailable predecessor] to the same extent that his or her pre-\ndecessor could have\"); see also Meriwether County, 171 F.3d at 1339\n(\"The law does not make a school district a prisoner based on factors,\nsuch as demographic tendencies, that are beyond its control.\"). We\nwill examine the district court’s Martin findings in turn.\n\n                           a. School Siting\n\n   The district court found that CMS had not shirked its duties under\nthe law with regard to school sitings. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 251-53. The record reveals that CMS has, to the extent practica-\nble, continually endeavored to site schools in order to foster integra-\ntion, and has adopted a policy of building schools in areas equally\naccessible to blacks and whites. Testimony of current board members\nindicated that in efforts to fulfill this policy, CMS has purchased\nproperty in low growth areas for school construction even though\nschools in predominantly white high growth areas were overcrowded.\nSee J.A. V-1986-87. In 1992 CMS reaffirmed its siting policy and\nresolved that, \"whenever possible,\" new schools would be built in\nareas that would \"provide black student enrollment of not less than 10\npercent from the census tracts serving the new school.\" J.A. XXXII-\n15,686. The impetus behind the resolution was growth in the periph-\nery of the county which the board speculated would continue patterns\nof housing segregation, thus making it more difficult to maintain\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      27\nracial balance in the schools. Evidence presented at trial indicated that\nthe ten percent rule was destined for failure because it was not possi-\nble to implement the rule and still \"meet the 60-minute bus ride\nlimit.\" J.A. XXII-10,869. Nevertheless, extensive evidence was pre-\nsented showing that CMS never sited schools in order to foster segre-\ngation and that \"every effort was made to try to find school sites that\nwould bring people together in balanced numbers.\" J.A. VI-2752; see\nMeriwether County, 171 F.3d at 1337 (stating that \"the absence of\nevidence indicating that racial motives played any part in the Board’s\ndecisionmaking process\" is relevant in accessing compliance with\ndesegregation orders). For example, CMS’s executive director of\nplanning and student placement testified that in siting schools CMS\n\"looked at both African-American and all populations not only in the\nvicinity of the site, but in the entire district.\" J.A. VII-2920. So dedi-\ncated was CMS to siting schools in integrated areas that it contem-\nplated refusing a gift of land for school use because the land was in\na predominantly white area. See J.A. V-1985.\n\n   Faced with growth in the predominantly white regions of the far\nsouth and north, see J.A. XXXIII-16,261, CMS was compelled to\nserve populations in those areas via school sitings. CMS’s data show\nthat in the late 1990s, student population was \"growing at nearly\n4,000 students per year,\" J.A. XXIX-14,133, and consequently the\nboard was \"just trying to keep up\" with the population explosion in\nbuilding schools, J.A. V-2249. Overcrowding was a problem, and in\nthe late 1990s \"the average high school expected to operate at 109\npercent of its capacity.\" J.A. XXIX-14,133. Even though CMS was\nforced to build schools at a rapid rate to serve an expanding student\npopulation, pupil assignment plans in which CMS described popula-\ntion growth as a \"major consideration[ ]\" are replete with efforts to\nimprove racial balance. J.A. XXIX-14,133. For example, the 1997-98\nassignment plan highlighted the creation and expansion of several\nmagnet programs specially designed to reduce the black ratio in a\nnumber of schools. See J.A. XXIX-14,147-51. To the extent practica-\nble, CMS did not sacrifice racial balance concerns to population\ngrowth. Though the two often pulled CMS in different directions, the\nrecord indicates that the board coordinated racial balance and school\nsitings as best it could under the circumstances. The evidence does\nnot indicate that the abandonment of the ten percent rule or other\n\f28      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\ndecisions regarding school siting were the result of a desire to perpet-\nuate the dual school system or circumvent the district court’s orders.\n\n   CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, citing to prior orders, counter that\nthe board has not done all that it could do in the area of school siting.\nErection of such a standard, however, would effectively replace prac-\nticability with possibility. See Manning, 244 F.3d at 945 (observing\nthat \"the law does not require a defendant school board to take every\nconceivable step in attempting to desegregate\"). The former implies\nmeasures that can be reasonably implemented under the circum-\nstances, while the latter omits the reasonableness requirement. For\ninstance, it was possible for CMS to adhere to the ten percent rule\nwhile ignoring growth in the far north and south of the county.\nYoungsters would have been compelled to ride buses for long periods\nwhile traveling with the flow of rush hour traffic, but it was nonethe-\nless possible to adhere to the ten percent rule. Of course, the practica-\nbility of a refusal to respond to growth in Charlotte-Mecklenburg is\nanother matter.\n\n   In the same vein, the Swann plaintiffs contend that school siting\ndecisions were a response to white flight, which is an impermissible\nreason for failing to comply with a desegregation order. Growth, of\ncourse, is far different from flight. And experts offered evidence of\n\"the economic boom in the Charlotte Metropolitan area in the last\ndecade.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,233. Charlotte-Mecklenburg is one of the\nmost dynamic areas in the South; it is far different from the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg of Swann, and much changed from that of Martin. In\nlight of the growth in the county and a plethora of evidence demon-\nstrating that the board used its best efforts to site schools in order to\nfoster integration, the district court did not commit error when it con-\ncluded that there is no \"continuing constitutional violation[ ] in the\narea of school siting.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 253.\n\n                        b. Burdens of Busing\n\n   As for the burdens of busing, the district court found that in the\nmost recent school year, 15,533 black students and 11,184 non-black\nstudents were bused for balancing purposes. Id. As stated earlier, traf-\nfic patterns make busing suburban students into the inner city far\nmore difficult than busing inner-city children into the suburbs. See\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     29\nJ.A. VI-2732; J.A. V-2228. Though a disproportionate number of\nAfrican-American students are bused, the growth, housing patterns,\nand traffic patterns support the district court’s conclusion that the\nrealities of the current situation should not block a unitary status\ndetermination. See Meriwether County, 171 F.3d at 1341 (finding no\nconstitutional violation when white students are \"somewhat less bur-\ndened by the transportation scheme\" because of demographic factors).\n\n                        c. Student Transfers\n\n   Finally, Martin’s concern with student transfers appears to have\nbeen based on the assumption that CMS would experience average\ngrowth. Courts are not omniscient, and the district court in 1979 could\nnot have foreseen the changing demographics that would make stu-\ndent transfers the least of CMS’s worries. In the present litigation, the\ndistrict court observed \"that CMS ‘kept an eye on [magnet transfers]\nso that there wouldn’t be a run on the bank so to speak from any one\nschool.’\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 250 n.10 (alteration in origi-\nnal). This finding is not clearly erroneous, nor can we discern the\nneed for more findings on this issue in light of post-Martin changes.\n\n                            3. Conclusion\n\n   In sum, the district court’s findings on student assignment are\n\"plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\" Anderson, 470\nU.S. at 573. The dual system of student assignment in CMS has been\neradicated \"to the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250. The\nimbalance existing in some schools is not traceable to the former dual\nsystem or to renewed discriminatory actions, but rather is a result of\ngrowth and shifting demographics. Consequently, we hold that the\ndistrict court’s findings on student assignment are not clearly errone-\nous.\n\n                       B. Faculty Assignment\n\n   In examining faculty assignment, the district court again used a\nplus/minus fifteen percent variance. Of the 126 schools operating in\nCMS, the district court found that in 1997-98 only ten schools were\nout of balance. The Swann plaintiffs point out that this number grew\n\f30      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nto sixteen in 1998-99, but this means that a mere twelve percent of\nthe schools were out of balance. This is a far cry from the dual system\nin which \"most of the 24,000 [black students] ha[d] no white teach-\ners.\" Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360. There is simply no evidence that\nCMS assigns black teachers to predominantly black schools and white\nteachers to predominantly white schools. Thus, the district court’s\nconclusion that this Green factor has been satisfied is not clearly erro-\nneous.\n\n                     C. Facilities and Resources\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs and CMS contend that the district court\nimpermissibly shifted the burden of proof on this factor. As a result\nof the alleged error of law, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that\nthis issue must be remanded to the district court.\n\n   This court has previously made clear that \"once a court has found\nan unlawful dual school system, [those alleging the existence of racial\ndisparities] are entitled to the presumption that current disparities are\ncausally related to prior segregation, and the burden of proving other-\nwise rests on the defendants.\" School Bd. of the City of Richmond v.\nBaliles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495020\"><a href=\"/opinion/495020/the-school-board-of-the-city-of-richmond-virginia-lois-harrison-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). In this case, however,\nthe district court noted that none of the prior orders entered in the\nlong history of the Swann litigation had ever found racial disparities\nto exist with regard to school facilities and concluded that CMS and\nthe Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing discrimination\nwith regard to facilities. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 263 (\"[I]t\nwould defy logic to place now the burden of proof on the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors, requiring them to prove that vestiges of discrimination in\nfacilities have been remedied, when the Court originally found no\nvestiges to exist.\"). In our view, this erroneous assignment of the bur-\nden of proof, which did not affect the manner in which the parties\ntried the case or otherwise prejudice their rights, is harmless and does\nnot undermine the district court’s factual conclusions regarding the\nfacilities factor.6\n  6\n   Given the counter-intuitive alignment of the parties in this case, it\ncould be argued that the presumption and burden allocation set forth in\nBaliles should not be applied, and that CMS should instead be required\nto prove the existence of racial disparity in its facilities.

City of Yonkers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764889\"><a href=\"/opinion/764889/united-states-of-america-yonkers-branch-national-association-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309-11 (2d Cir. 1999), vacated\non reh’g, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766833\"><a href=\"/opinion/766833/united-states-of-america-yonkers-branch-national-association-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1999).\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      31\n   Immediately after assigning the burden to CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs, the district court’s order nonetheless summarized and\nweighed the facilities evidence presented by the parties. The district\ncourt carefully analyzed the testimony and report of Dr. Dwayne\nGardner, an expert witness for CMS. Dr. Gardner analyzed seventy-\nthree schools—every identifiably black school in CMS and a sam-\npling of balanced schools and predominantly white schools. Dr. Gard-\nner measured the adequacy, safety, healthfulness, accessibility,\nflexibility, efficiency, expansibility, and appearance of the schools.\nBased on the inspection he grouped schools as follows: \"0-44 (sug-\ngests replacement), 45-59 (needs major improvement), 60-74 (needs\nminor improvement), 75-89 (serves program needs), and 90-100\n(exceptional quality).\" Id. at 264. The survey revealed that of the four\nschools that warranted replacement, two were majority white, and two\nwere imbalanced black. See J.A. XXV-12,182-86. Thirty-four schools\nfell into the \"needs major improvement\" category, of which sixteen\nwere imbalanced black and eighteen identifiably white.\n\n   The district court determined that Dr. Gardner’s testimony estab-\nlished that any current disparities were functions of the age of the\nfacilities at issue, because\n\n    different building standards apply when a new facility is\n    constructed as compared to when an older facility is reno-\n    vated or upgraded. In other words, the renovation of an\n    older facility usually complies with the code under which\n    the facility was built. Because most facilities in the predomi-\n    nately black inner city are older while facilities in the pre-\n    dominately white suburbs are newer, the inference is that\n    differences in building standards tend to affect black stu-\n    dents disproportionately. This does not amount to racial dis-\n    crimination. Indeed, this practice applies regardless of the\n    racial composition of the school. Thus, older schools that\n    are predominately white—several of which were built in the\n    1920s—are likewise affected by this practice.\n\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 265 (footnote and transcript refer-\nences omitted). Thus, the district court concluded from Dr. Gardner’s\ntestimony and report \"that CMS’s facilities needs are spread across\nthe system without regard to the racial composition of its schools.\" Id.\n\f32       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\n   The district court also considered the testimony of CMS’s assistant\nsuperintendent of building services, who testified that out of 108\nschools in need of renovations, eighty-one percent were racially bal-\nanced or identifiably white. See J.A. VIII-3810 & 3818. The district\ncourt concluded that this witness’s testimony likewise demonstrated\nthat the deficiencies in CMS’s facilities were unrelated to the former\nde jure system.\n   Finally, the court considered CMS’s track record in renovating old\nfacilities, praising its practice of allocating funds on a per-pupil basis\nand noting that \"CMS has spent a large portion of [its] bond money\non improving schools in predominantly black areas.\" Capacchione,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 266.\n   After an extensive discussion of this evidence, the court made the\nfollowing finding of fact with regard to facilities:\n      Just as Judge McMillan found thirty years ago, the Court\n      finds today that inequities in facilities exist throughout the\n      system regardless of the racial makeup of the school. These\n      disparities are generally the result of the relative ages of the\n      facilities, combined with an ongoing lack of funding and the\n      need to accommodate unprecedented growth.\nId.\n   This finding is clearly determinative of the question of unitary sta-\ntus as to facilities, regardless of which party carried the burden of\nproof. That is, the district court, after carefully considering and\nweighing all the evidence presented on this factor, concluded that any\ndisparity as to the condition of the facilities that might exist was not\ncaused by any intentional discrimination by CMS, but instead was a\nfunction of the age and location of the facilities and the ever-present\nproblem of allocating all too scarce funds. Even if the district court\nhad assigned the burden of proof to the plaintiff-intervenors, this fac-\ntual finding would have compelled a ruling in their favor. In fact, the\ndistrict court acknowledged as much, stating \"that the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors have proven, to the extent possible, the absence of intent\nand causation.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION      33\n   Therefore, because the district court’s findings, which were based\non the court’s weighing of all of the relevant evidence presented at\ntrial, would have yielded the same conclusion under a proper assign-\nment of the burden of proof, any error with regard to the burden of\nproof is harmless.

Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 992\n(recognizing that an error in shifting the burden of proof in a school\ndesegregation case may be harmless if the record is such that the court\ncan conclude that substantial rights have not been prejudiced).\n\n   Because any error associated with the burden of proof is harmless,\nthe only question that remains is whether the district court’s factual\nfindings about the facilities are clearly erroneous. Though the evi-\ndence could have been weighed differently on this factor, \"[w]here\nthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s\nchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson, 470\nU.S. at 574. In 1969, the district court found that there was no consti-\ntutional violation in the \"quality of school buildings and facilities.\"\nSwann, 300 F. Supp. at 1372. The Capacchione court found that this\nremains true today, and the evidence as a whole indicates that this\nfinding is not clearly erroneous.\n\ncourt really made alternative rulings on the facilities question: The court\nfirst concluded that CMS and the Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of\nproof with regard to facilities and that they failed to carry that burden.\nSee Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 267 (\"[T]he Swann Plaintiffs have\nfailed to overcome the Court’s previous findings on facilities by estab-\nlishing the requisite discriminatory intent and causation.\"). The court\nthen ruled in the alternative, as indicated by the footnote and the find-\nings, that the plaintiff-intervenors proved that any disparities were the\nresult of factors unrelated to state action.\n\f34     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                         D. Transportation\n\n   During the 1998 school year, five out of every six students in CMS\nrode a school bus. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 267. The par-\nties do not dispute the district court’s finding that \"CMS provides free\nbus transportation to all students who do not live within a mile and\na half of their schools.\" Id. The focus of the Swann plaintiffs’ argu-\nment on this factor deals with the Martin opinion. As previously dis-\ncussed, Martin does not provide the framework for a unitary status\ndetermination and the district court’s interpretation of Martin, along\nwith the finding that the present state of busing \"may be about the\nbest CMS can do,\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 253, does not con-\nstitute error.\n\n                        E. Staff Assignment\n\n   The district court, noting that findings of discrimination in school\nstaffing were never made, concluded that CMS has complied with its\nconstitutional duties. The parties point this court to no contrary evi-\ndence, nor have we discovered such in the record. Therefore, we hold\nthat the district court’s findings regarding the fifth Green factor are\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\n                    F. Extracurricular Activities\n\n   The district court concluded that there was no discrimination or\nvestiges of discrimination with regard to extracurricular activities.\nThe evidence presented at trial showed that the ratios of blacks and\nwhites participating in extracurricular activities, though varying\nsomewhat from year to year, is approximately equal. See J.A. XXIV-\n11,634. Areas where there are disparities were not shown to be linked\nto the former dual system. For example, blacks often outnumber\nwhites in holding elective offices in student government, but whites\nhave a higher level of representation in honors programs. No evidence\nis found in the record to indicate that CMS somehow pushes African-\nAmericans toward student government and away from honors pro-\ngrams. Consequently, the district court’s conclusion that CMS has\nsatisfied this Green factor is not clearly erroneous.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     35\n                        G. Ancillary Factors\n\n                         1. Teacher Quality\n\n   The district court found that there was no discrimination in the\nquality of teaching. The Swann plaintiffs contend that this finding is\nclearly erroneous because students in imbalanced African-American\nschools are more likely to have inexperienced teachers. This \"experi-\nence gap,\" to the extent it exists, is minuscule. The district court\nfound that \"teachers in imbalanced-black schools had 0.7 to 1.3 fewer\nyears experience than the district averages and had 1.6 to 2.9 fewer\nyears experience than teachers in imbalanced-white schools.\" Capa-\ncchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 271. To use middle school teachers as an\nexample, the statistics reveal that the average middle school teacher\nin an imbalanced African-American school had 8.2 years experience\nversus 9.8 years for his counterpart in an imbalanced white school. Id.\nThese numbers clearly support a finding of equality rather than dis-\nparity, and cannot undermine the district court’s conclusion on this\nfactor.\n\n   The district court also pointed to evidence indicating that experi-\nence does not necessarily relate to competency. For example, accord-\ning to former Superintendent Murphy, it is not uncommon to have\n\"excellent first-year teachers\" and \"very weak 35th-year teachers.\"\nJ.A. VI-2795. Other witnesses observed that the newer teachers had\nbetter \"knowledge of various teaching strategies\" and were more com-\nfortable with diverse classrooms. J.A. VII-3275.\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs also assert that imbalanced African-American\nschools have fewer teachers with advanced degrees. For instance, in\nimbalanced black high schools only thirty-one percent of the teachers\nheld advanced degrees, while forty-six percent of the teachers in\nimbalanced white high schools held advanced degrees. See Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 271. As it was with teacher experience, testi-\nmony was offered establishing that the number of degrees a teacher\npossesses does not necessarily translate into competence or quality\ninstruction. See J.A. VII-3276. According to former Superintendent\nMurphy, \"the degree level was not a significant indicator of getting\nbetter performance on the part of the teacher.\" J.A. VI-2795. Expert\nreports submitted by the plaintiff-intervenors also indicated that there\n\f36      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nis \"no significant relationship\" between black achievement and\nteacher education levels. J.A. XXXIII-16,221. In sum, the district\ncourt’s conclusion that African-American students receive equal\naccess to quality teachers is not clearly erroneous.\n\n                      2. Student Achievement\n\n   The district court found that the existence of an achievement gap\nbetween black and white students was not a vestige of the dual system\nor evidence of discrimination in the current operation of CMS. This\nwas an area of immense disagreement at trial, and the parties pre-\nsented a mountain of data on this subject. Though the Fourteenth\nAmendment guarantees equal protection but not equal outcomes, if\nlow African-American achievement is a result of the former de jure\nsystem, it must be eliminated to the extent practicable. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 249-50. Conversely, to the extent that low achievement\nis linked to other factors, it is beyond the reach of the court’s author-\nity. Most courts of appeals confronting this issue, including this court,\nhave declined to consider the achievement gap as a vestige of dis-\ncrimination or as evidence of current discrimination. See Baliles, 829\nF.2d at 1313 (upholding lower court’s findings that low achievement\nis \"primarily attributable to the high incidence of poverty\" in the\nschool district); see also United States v. City of Yonkers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766833\"><a href=\"/opinion/766833/united-states-of-america-yonkers-branch-national-association-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that \"using achievement test scores\nas a measure, either direct or indirect, of a school system’s movement\naway from segregation is deeply problematic\"), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

See J.A.\nXXXIII-16,178. For example, Dr. Armor’s studies showed that\nAfrican-American students in the third through fifth grades attending\nschools sixteen to twenty-five percent African-American scored the\nsame on standardized tests as their counterparts in schools seventy-\nfive percent black or greater. See J.A. at 16,214. Similarly, African-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION      37\nAmerican students in the sixth through eighth grades attending\nschools sixteen percent black or less scored the same on standardized\ntests as their counterparts in schools seventy-five percent black or\ngreater. See J.A. XXXIII-16,215.\n   In order to shed light on the true causes of the achievement gap,\nDr. Armor turned to socioeconomic factors. The data revealed star-\ntling differences between black and white children in CMS.\n      Average black family income is $31,000 compared to\n      $59,000 for whites, and only 15 [percent] of black parents\n      are college graduates, compared to 58 percent for white par-\n      ents. A huge poverty gap is also revealed, with 63 percent\n      of black students on free lunch compared to only 9 percent\n      of white students. Finally, 83 percent of white students have\n      both parents at home, compared to only 42 percent for black\n      students.\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,179. According to Dr. Armor, the socioeconomic fac-\ntors plus the second grade scores, which are the earliest available,\nexplain \"nearly 80 percent of the reading gap and over 70 percent of\nthe math gap.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,180. Former Superintendent Murphy\ntestified that in his experience \"[p]oor students come behind and stay\nthat way. And in Charlotte, a majority of poor students happen to be\nAfrican-American.\" J.A. VI-2696. Dan Saltrick, former assistant\nsuperintendent for instructional services, also testified that in his\nexperience low student test scores related to parental support which\nin turn was \"a matter of . . . socioeconomic levels.\" J.A. VII-3280.\nWhile socioeconomic disparities between black and white pupils are\ntroubling, they are not the result of CMS’s actions or inactions and\ntherefore are beyond the scope of the original desegregation order.\nSee Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1314 (\"Educational deficiencies that result\nfrom problems such as poverty are best remedied by programs\ndirected toward eliminating poverty, not by indirect solutions through\nschool programs.\").8 Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err\n  8\n   Despite evidence that the achievement gap results from factors out-\nside CMS’s control, the district court found that CMS has undertaken\nsundry measures to eliminate the gap. For example, CMS adopted finan-\ncial incentives for teachers and principals tied to student performance,\nurged black students to take advanced placement and other higher level\n\f38      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nin finding that the achievement gap between black and white students\nis not a vestige of past discrimination or evidence of present discrimi-\nnation.\n                        3. Student Discipline\n   The district court found \"that any disparities that exist in the area\nof discipline are not causally related to the dual system.\" Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 281. In none of the court’s prior orders is there\nany indication that CMS has ever discriminated in meting out punish-\nment for disruptive students. However, recent statistics show that of\nthe 13,206 students disciplined from 1996-98, sixty-six percent were\nAfrican-American. See J.A. XXIV-11,637. As the district court noted,\n\"disparity does not, by itself, constitute discrimination.\" Capacchione,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 281. The idea that CMS should have a disciplinary\nquota is patently absurd, and there is no evidence in the record that\nCMS targets African-American students for discipline. Instead, the\nevidence indicates that CMS has adopted guidelines whereby students\nreceive the same level of punishment for certain offenses to ensure\nthat the amount of punishment will not vary from school to school.\nA student charged with a disciplinary infraction may also appeal the\ncharge \"and may assert that the charge was due to racial bias.\" Id.\nThere is simply no evidence in the record that CMS treats African-\nAmerican students differently in disciplinary matters. Hence, the dis-\ntrict court’s conclusion that the disciplinary disparities are unrelated\nto the former de jure system is not clearly erroneous.\n                            H. Good Faith\n   Lastly, the district court found that CMS has complied with the\ndesegregation decree in good faith. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491\n(requiring school board \"to demonstrate its good-faith commitment to\na constitutional course of action\"). Seven factors supported the district\n\nclasses, challenged all students by removing \"fluff courses\" from the cur-\nriculum, provided tutors and other forms of staff support to accelerate\nstudent preparedness, and adopted pre-kindergarten programs to acceler-\nate preparedness for the youngest of students. See Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 273-275.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     39\ncourt’s good-faith finding: (1) no further relief has been sought since\nthe district court removed the case from the active docket in 1975; (2)\nCMS has gone above and beyond the court’s orders by continually\nstriving to achieve balance even when the imbalance was uncon-\nnected to the dual system; (3) the board has been open to community\ninput and sought community support for its integrative efforts; (4) the\nboard has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to desegregation\nthrough various resolutions; (5) African-Americans currently occupy\nfour of the nine seats on the school board, including the chair; (6) the\nboard’s actions over the past thirty years do not evince discriminatory\nmotives; and (7) \"no evidence has been presented that school authori-\nties were guilty of easily correctable errors.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 282-83.\n   Testimony from former board members indicated that the court’s\norder has been \"institutionalized,\" J.A. V-2222, and that the board \"al-\nways stuck to what the rules were.\" J.A. V-2234. Former Superinten-\ndent Murphy testified that when he arrived in Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhe found a \"unique\" environment where \"everybody wanted to make\nsure that their schools were racially balanced.\" J.A. VI-2686. In 1992,\nDr. Stolee suggested a magnet plan to increase integration, and, in the\ncourse of his recommendations, observed that \"[f]or the last twenty\nyears, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education and the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg community have, in good faith, complied\nwith the orders of the court.\" J.A. XXXII-15,570. He further observed\n\"that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board and community have a great\ndeal of pride in the fact that they successfully met a challenge and\nmade the solution work.\" J.A. XXXII-15,571.\n   Of course, both in the district court and in appellate arguments,\ncurrent CMS officials engaged in much self-recrimination and\nclaimed that they had not pursued the dismantlement of the dual sys-\ntem with the requisite zeal. Right on cue, the Swann plaintiffs\ndescribe this case as \"unique\" because CMS \"has acknowledged its\nown failure to comply with specific directives\" of the district court.\nSwann Plaintiffs’ Response to Petition for Rehearing at 10. The dis-\ntrict court gave little weight to CMS’s assertions that the board had\nnot put forth enough effort, and the evidence presented at trial amply\nsupports the district court in this regard. Former Superintendent Mur-\nphy testified that despite a report indicating that CMS was unitary and\nhis belief that CMS \"w[as] definitely in compliance,\" no effort was\n\f40      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nmade to dissolve the court order. J.A. VI-2706. Dr. Murphy gave\nthree reasons for the avoidance of a unitary status hearing. First, he\nadvised board members that the court hearing would be \"a long,\ndrawn-out process which would cost millions of dollars, and that\nwould be money taken away from the instructional program.\" J.A. VI-\n2706. Second, Dr. Murphy feared that if CMS was declared unitary\n\"we would not be eligible for federal funding for our magnet\nschools.\" J.A. VI-2706; see also J.A. XXII-10,563 (CMS report\nobserving that \"school districts that intend to use magnet schools for\ndesegregation purposes can apply for grants from the federal govern-\nment\"); J.A. XXI-10,521 (1996-1997 Federal Magnet School Assis-\ntance Program Evaluation Report in which CMS describes federal\nfunding as \"an integral part\" of its pupil assignment plan). Finally, Dr.\nMurphy thought it best to remain under court order so CMS could\ncontinue to racially balance schools even though the de jure violation\nhad been remedied.\n   Dr. Susan Purser, the current associate superintendent of education\nservices of CMS, expressed a similar desire for CMS to remain under\ncourt order. Though Dr. Purser testified that she believed that the\nschool board, superintendent, and administration were dedicated to\nenhancing educational opportunities for all of CMS’s students regard-\nless of race, she nonetheless expressed a preference for court supervi-\nsion. Dr. Purser pointed out that the current \"Board has only a limited\ntime, because these are elected positions,\" J.A. XVII-8076, and that\nover time \"superintendents will change, [and] the people involved in\n[CMS] will change.\" J.A. XVII-8077. At this point in the cross exam-\nination, counsel asked Dr. Purser: \"But you don’t know what any\nfuture School Board or administration will do either way, do you?\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser responded: \"That’s exactly my point.\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser’s testimony and that of Dr. Murphy exem-\nplify why the Supreme Court has stressed that \"federal supervision of\nlocal school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy\npast discrimination.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247; see also Coalition to\nSave Our Children, 90 F.3d at 761 n.6 (warning of \"the potential for\nthe entrenchment of [a] putatively transitional desegregation\nscheme\"). The district court’s desegregation orders were not intended\nto continue after CMS remedied the de jure violation, nor were they\nintended to suspend the democratic process with no prospect of resto-\nration. Yet the orders have been institutionalized to the point that\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     41\nCMS officials cannot imagine life without them. Once a yoke meant\nto steer CMS towards compliance with the Constitution, the orders\nare now used by CMS officials as mechanisms for the attainment of\ndifferent goals. In truth, CMS officials have little desire for a unitary\nstatus determination and are struggling to keep the orders firmly in\nplace.\n   Ironically, CMS’s clinging to the temporary desegregation orders\nbuttresses the district court’s finding that it is unlikely \"CMS would\nreturn to an intentionally-segregative system.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. at 284. If CMS will go to such lengths to keep the court’s\norders in place so that it may continue racial balancing and other poli-\ncies, it is unthinkable that CMS will attempt to revive the dual system.\nAccordingly, the district judge’s finding of good faith is not clearly\nerroneous.\n                      I. CMS’s Remedial Plan\n   As a response to the plaintiff-intervenors’ push for unitary status,\nCMS developed a \"remedial plan\" addressing many of the Green fac-\ntors and other ancillary factors. See J.A. XXIII-11,028. The district\ncourt dismissed the remedial plan as a \"‘litigation strategy’ plan\" and\ndeclined to consider it. Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 256. CMS and\nthe Swann plaintiffs characterize the district court’s treatment of the\nremedial plan as a fundamental error of law that requires reversal of\nthe unitary status determination. First, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs\naver that the district court misconstrued the test for unitary status.\nAdopting the test crafted by the panel opinion, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs assert that a district court must consider (1) what a school\ndistrict has done, and (2) what a school district may do in the future.\nSee Belk, 233 F.3d at 252-53. Because the district court did not under-\ntake the latter inquiry as to the remedial plan, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs argue that the district court’s order must be reversed. This\nproffered two-part test is divined from Supreme Court cases which\nhave instructed district courts to ask \"whether the Board ha[s] com-\nplied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered,\nand whether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50; see also\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n  While we agree with the first prong of the test, we do not agree that\nexamining \"whether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been\n\f42     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\neliminated to the extent practicable,\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50,\nrequires a district court—as a matter of law—to consider a remedial\nplan conceived, drafted, and offered by one of the parties during the\nlawsuit as an obvious defense to it. The plain meaning of the relevant\nlanguage is that in some desegregation cases simple compliance with\nthe court’s orders is not enough for meaningful desegregation to take\nplace. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 25 (stating that \"a district court’s reme-\ndial decree is to be judged by its effectiveness\"). For example, a\ndecree entered in the 1960s or 1970s could have underestimated the\nextent of the remedy required, or changes in the school district could\nhave rendered the decree obsolete. In either case, a district court must\nlook beyond mere compliance with the original decree and ask\nwhether the vestiges of the dual system have been eliminated to the\nextent practicable. In the present case, the district court undertook\nsuch an inquiry. Not only did the district court address compliance,\nbut it also looked beyond the original decree and examined how the\nextensive changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area have affected\nthe dismantling of the former dual system. Hence, the district court\nwas not required under Dowell and Freeman to have considered\nCMS’s eleventh-hour remedial plan.\n   Likewise, the district court did not run afoul of Federal Rule of\nEvidence 402 when it refused to consider the remedial plan. Rule 402,\nof course, declares that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible.\" Fed.\nR. Evid. 402. Even relevant evidence may be excluded, however,\nwhen its probative value is substantially outweighed by consider-\nations of the needless presentation of cumulative evidence. See Fed.\nR. Evid. 403. And CMS’s remedial plan was certainly cumulative, cit-\ning and summarizing several expert reports which had been admitted\ninto evidence. For example, the plan’s discussion of faculty assign-\nment is based on the reports of Dr. William Trent, Dr. Robert\nPeterkin, and Dr. Roslyn Mickelson; the plan’s discussion of facilities\nis based on Dr. Gardner’s report; the plan’s discussion of the achieve-\nment gap between blacks and whites is based on the reports of Dr.\nTrent, Dr. Peterkin, and Dr. Mickelson; and the plan’s student assign-\nment discussion is based on Dr. Gordon Foster’s report. All of the\naforementioned reports were admitted into evidence and the authors\nof the reports testified at the hearing and were subject to cross-\nexamination. Hence, much of the remedial plan was cumulative, pro-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      43\nviding the district court with but a rehashing of expert reports and tes-\ntimony.\n   To the extent that the remedial plan contained relevant evidence\nappearing nowhere else in the record, we hold that the exclusion of\nsuch evidence was harmless. According to Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure 61, a \"court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard\nany error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the sub-\nstantial rights of the parties.\" Listing myriad deficiencies, objectives,\nand strategies, the thirty-one page remedial plan is often short on spe-\ncifics. Considering the amount of evidence presented on every aspect\nof CMS’s operations during other phases of the two-month bench\ntrial, we cannot hold that the exclusion of the remedial plan affected\nCMS’s substantial rights. See Ingram Coal Co. v. Mower, L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534212\"><a href=\"/opinion/534212/ingram-coal-company-a-corporation-v-mower-limited-partnership-a-west/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366 (4th Cir. 1989) (applying Rule 61). Because the exclu-\nsion of the remedial plan in no way renders the judgment below sus-\npect, the district court’s treatment of the plan cannot support reversal.\n                            J. Conclusion\n   Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the district court’s unitary sta-\ntus determination in toto. The district court’s findings on the Green\nfactors and the ancillary factors are bereft of clear error and we cannot\ndiscern any error of law affecting the substantial rights of the parties.\nAfter more than three decades of federal court supervision, CMS has\ncomplied in good faith with the mandate of Brown embodied in the\ndistrict court’s desegregation orders to achieve a unitary school sys-\ntem. The dual system has been dismantled and the vestiges of prior\ndiscrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable.\n   This is not to say that CMS is a perfect school system—it is not.\nLike school systems across the nation, CMS faces an expanding pupil\npopulation, aging facilities, and a scarcity of funds. These difficulties,\nhowever, are not vestiges of the former de jure system and therefore\ndo not have constitutional implications. Considering CMS’s exem-\nplary efforts in eradicating the segregated school system, we are con-\nfident that de jure segregation is history.\n                         III. Magnet Schools\n  I turn now to Capacchione’s challenge to CMS’s 1992 magnet\nschools plan. Specifically, Capacchione contends that his daughter\n\f44      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nCristina was unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school\nprogram on account of her race. Capacchione does not argue that race\nshould not have been a factor in the magnet admissions process, but\nthat the inflexible quotas, which operated to leave seats in these spe-\ncialized schools vacant despite long waiting lists, went beyond what\nwas permissible under prior court orders and the Constitution.\n   As noted previously, CMS operated its schools in nearly perfect\nracial balance for almost twenty years under a pupil assignment plan,\nadopted by the board and approved by the district court in 1974,\nwhich primarily utilized paired elementary schools, satellite atten-\ndance zones, a feeder system, and three experimental \"optional\nschools.\" See Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103-05; J.A. XXVIII-13,536-\n44. In 1991, however, CMS hired Dr. Stolee to examine racial imbal-\nance that was being caused anew by the demographic shifts and popu-\nlation growth in Mecklenburg County. The result of Dr. Stolee’s\nlabors was a new pupil assignment plan, entitled \"CMS Student\nAssignment Plan: A New Generation of Excellence.\" This new plan\nemphasized the use of magnet schools, which would allow CMS to\nphase out the unpopular paired elementary schools. Magnet schools,\nmany of which were located in predominately black neighborhoods,\noffered a specialized curriculum or innovative instructional styles not\nfound in the other schools in the system.\n   Former Superintendent Murphy oversaw implementation of the\nStolee plan and testified that the magnet program was adopted\nbecause CMS \"wanted to attract more white youngsters into the inner\ncity schools\" in order to meet CMS’s racial-balance goals. J.A. VI-\n2709. Dr. Stolee observed in his report that \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhas had a long and successful experience with mandatory school\nassignments,\" but that in order to combat demographic shifts CMS\nshould adopt a plan based on voluntarism. J.A. XXXII-15,581; see\nalso Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (1995) (Jenkins III)\n(\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging voluntary move-\nment of students within a school district in a pattern that aids desegre-\ngation on a voluntary basis, without requiring extensive busing and\nredrawing of district boundary lines.\"); J.A. XXVIII-13,796 (student\nassignment plan boasting that \"Charlotte, the city which prides itself\non leading the nation in integration through busing, now has the\nopportunity to become the city to lead the nation in voluntary bus-\ning\"). A desegregation plan using magnet schools, according to Dr.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      45\nStolee, would \"give[ ] each parent an opportunity to make a choice\nbetween a school serving the area in which the family resides, a\nschool in some other area, or a school offering a very specific attrac-\ntive program.\" J.A. XXXII-15,580. Dr. Stolee also recognized that the\nmagnet-centered plan would be a dramatic shift from the prior deseg-\nregation plan which featured paired elementary schools, satellite\nattendance zones, and a feeder system. Thus, as part of the plan, he\nrecommended that CMS secure approval from the district court before\nmaking any changes. Indeed, Dr. Stolee’s \"RECOMMENDATION\n#1,\" out of forty-four, read:\n    THE SCHOOL BOARD, THROUGH LEGAL COUNSEL,\n    SHOULD APPROACH THE FEDERAL COURT TO\n    SECURE APPROVAL TO CHANGE THE COURT-\n    ORDERED DESEGREGATION PLAN.\nJ.A. XXXII-15,578. This recommendation was consistent with the\nprior district court order directing CMS to apply to the district court\n\"before making any material departure\" from the approved desegrega-\ntion plan.

However,\nCMS ignored Dr. Stolee’s advice and the district court’s instruction,\nchoosing instead to withhold these changes in the desegregation plan\nfrom the district court.\n   The crux of the problem with CMS’s magnet school plan is its\nadmissions process. As aptly described by the district court, it oper-\nates as follows:\n    At the start of the process, CMS first fills seats with prefer-\n    ences based on whether the applicant lives in close proxim-\n    ity to the school and whether the applicant has any siblings\n    in the school. CMS then fills the remaining seats by select-\n    ing students from a black lottery and a non-black lottery\n    until the precise racial balance is achieved.\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As\noriginally explained to the board, the plan sought a balance of sixty\npercent white and forty percent black in the magnet schools with a\nplus or minus fifteen percent deviation. See J.A. XXVIII-13,705.\nUnfortunately, CMS opted for a strict ratio of sixty percent white and\nforty percent black, and decreed in its 1992 student assignment plan\n\f46      BELK v.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD   OF   EDUCATION    47\n                                             Volume 2 of 4\n\f48     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\n                            A. Immunity\n\n   I begin with the question of whether CMS officials are entitled to\nimmunity because their actions in adopting and implementing the\nStolee magnet program in 1992 were taken pursuant to and were con-\nsistent with the desegregation orders and opinions issued by the dis-\ntrict court and Supreme Court in the early 1970s. In the main, CMS\nasserts that it is entitled to immunity for its act of implementing the\n1992 magnet schools program without court approval because the\nprior desegregation orders authorized the use of \"optional schools\"\nand a racial balance goal for filling them. Like the district court, I\nconclude that the magnet schools plan, as implemented, was not\nauthorized by the prior court orders and that, for the reasons stated\nhereafter, the CMS officials are not entitled to immunity.\n\n                   1. Magnet-Centered Program\n\n  As an initial matter, I note that prior court orders did not counte-\nnance implementation of a desegregation plan based primarily on\nmagnet schools. Never was CMS given carte blanche to adopt such\na program absent court review and approval. CMS counters that a\nmagnet-centered plan was permissible insofar as the district court\napproved the establishment of a few experimental optional schools in\n1974 as part of a plan utilizing paired elementary schools, satellite\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     49\nattendance zones, and a feeder system. See Swann, 379 F. Supp. at\n1103-04. What CMS fails to recognize is that optional schools were\nbut a small part of the plan approved in 1974, likely because the dis-\ntrict court was very skeptical about their efficacy as a desegregation\ntechnique. In the course of its order, the district court noted that the\nhistory of optional schools was marked by \"failure\" in a number of\nregards and warned CMS to be cautious in creating them. Id. at 1103.\nConsequently, CMS began with three experimental optional schools\nin 1974 and increased the number to only six by the early 1990s.\n\n   The optional schools created in the wake of the 1974 order placed\nmore \"emphasis on open or traditional education than normally\noffered in conventional schools.\" J.A. XXXII-15,683. The optional\nschools’ traditional programs \"offer[ed] an enriched and highly struc-\ntured education,\" J.A. XXXII-15,732, whereas the open programs\noffered a \"student-centered\" environment that \"encouraged [students]\nto take responsibility for their behavior and for their own learning.\"\nJ.A. XXXII-15,733. The optional schools approved by the 1974 order\nwere not as diverse and specialized as the magnet school program\nimplemented in 1992. The program suggested by Dr. Stolee offered\nschools specializing in traditional and open educational methods and\ncreated specialized schools featuring the Montessori method; science,\nmathematics, and technology; foreign language immersion; learning\nimmersion programs for young children; enhanced education for aca-\ndemically gifted students; and communication studies programs. See\nJ.A. XXXII-15730-41. However, both the optional schools and the\nmagnet schools were designed to achieve the same end result—the\nattraction of students to a school in a particular location by using a\nspecialized curriculum or teaching technique. Thus, Dr. Stolee, in rec-\nommending the magnet program in 1992, observed that CMS, via its\noptional schools, \"had some experience in such specialized schools.\"\nJ.A. XXXII-15,580.\n\n   Despite the district court’s 1970 directive that CMS obtain court\napproval for material modifications to the court-imposed desegrega-\ntion plan, the court’s skepticism of optional schools, the approval pro-\ncess that took place in the ensuing years, and Dr. Stolee’s specific\nrecommendation in 1992 that CMS seek court approval for the new\nmagnet schools program, CMS inexplicably chose not to return to the\ndistrict court to obtain approval of the magnet schools plan. At appel-\n\f50     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\nlate argument before the entire court, CMS contended that the lan-\nguage in the 1970 order requiring court approval for material\ndepartures was superceded by the 1974 order. CMS points to no lan-\nguage in the 1974 order supporting this argument and its repeated\ncitations to and reliance on pre-1974 orders regarding other aspects\nof this case further call into doubt this new line of argument. More-\nover, the 1974 order made clear that \"[e]xcept as modified herein, all\nprevious orders of court remain in effect.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at\n1105 (emphasis added). Hence, the 1970 order’s requirement that\nCMS obtain leave of court \"before making any material departure\nfrom any specific requirement set out in the order\" remained binding\non school officials. Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 270.\n\n   Nevertheless, I recognize that magnet schools are frequently used\nby school districts under a desegregation order, see Milliken v. Brad-\nley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1977) (Milliken II) (approving of magnet\nschools as a desegregation tool), and that the district court \"encour-\naged [CMS officials] to use their full ‘know-how’ and resources to\nattain\" a desegregated school system, Swann 311 F. Supp. at 269.\nIndeed, the plaintiff-intervenors’ own expert has touted magnet pro-\ngrams as an \"effective way to attract sizable numbers of white stu-\ndents to predominately minority schools.\" David J. Armor, Forced\nJustice: School Desegregation and the Law 223 (1995). Thus, a mag-\nnet schools program, properly implemented, can no doubt be an effec-\ntive desegregation tool. However, a conclusion that CMS was free to\nadopt any form of magnet school program it might wish to see in\nplace does not flow from this general proposition.\n\n   I must forcefully disagree with CMS’s contention that the mention\nof optional schools in the 1974 order provided legal cover for the\nimplementation of an assignment plan depending almost entirely on\nmagnet schools. The portions of the district court order authorizing\n\"optional schools\" could perhaps be read in isolation as authorizing\nCMS’s use of \"magnet schools\" in more diverse, specialized areas,\nbut the order did not authorize CMS to unilaterally abandon pairing,\nsatellites, and feeders in exchange for a magnet-centered plan.\nDespite the import of the 1974 order, and without even a nod to the\ndistrict court, CMS in 1992 abandoned the approved desegregation\nplan in favor of magnets. By the end of the decade CMS had created\nfifty-eight magnet programs—a far cry from the six optional schools\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     51\nin operation in the school year just prior to the adoption of the Stolee\nplan. See J.A. XXXIV-16,721-30. CMS describes this abandonment\nof the prior plan as but an expansion of the approved use of optional\nschools. Clearly, this \"expansion\" was in reality a substantial restruc-\nturing and cannot be squared with the unambiguous directives of prior\norders.\n\n                           2. Strict Ratios\n\n   Even if I could conclude that a magnet-centered plan was permitted\nunder prior court orders, the plan implemented by CMS is nonetheless\nultra vires because it combines a rigid ratio of sixty percent white and\nforty percent black with a policy decreeing that \"slots reserved for one\nrace will not be filled by students of another race.\" J.A. XXXII-15,702.9\nIn 1970, the district court issued a desegregation order to CMS, not-\ning that the order was \"not based upon any requirement of ‘racial bal-\nance.’\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 267 (emphasis added). The court\nreiterated \"that efforts should be made to reach a 71-29 ratio in the\nvarious schools so that there will be no basis for contending that one\nschool is racially different from the others, but . . . that variations\nfrom the norm may be unavoidable.\" Id. at 267-68 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the guide-\nlines set forth in the district court’s order and also addressed the sub-\nject of racial quotas. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 23-25.\n\n   With regard to the district court’s goal of achieving a racial balance\nof seventy-one percent white and twenty-nine percent black, the Court\ntook care to note that \"[t]he constitutional command to desegregate\nschools does not mean that every school in every community must\nalways reflect the racial composition of the school system as a\nwhole.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24. But central to the issue now before\nus, the Court held that had the district court\n  9\n   My colleagues in the majority on this issue eloquently argue that\nCMS was permitted to take race-conscious measures when complying\nwith desegregation orders. With this I agree—a school district under\norder to desegregate must of course take race into account when assign-\ning students. The primary question regarding the magnet program, how-\never, is whether CMS ran afoul of the Supreme Court’s prohibitions\nagainst inflexible ratios, not whether race-conscious measures are per-\nmissible.\n\f52       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\n       require[d], as a matter of substantive constitutional right,\n       any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that\n       approach would be disapproved and we would be obliged to\n       reverse.\n\nId.

The goal was upheld, only upon the condition\nthat \"use made of mathematical ratios was no more than a starting\npoint in the process of shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible\nrequirement.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 25.\n\n   Just two years after the Supreme Court, in this very case, made\nclear that strict ratios were unacceptable, the district court, in a care-\nfully worded order permitting CMS to create optional schools,\napproved an intentionally flexible enrollment formula of \"about or\nabove 20% black students.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1104 (emphasis\nadded). The district court recognized that the \"actual enrollment of the\noptional school may have to be guided by its racial composition and\nby the number drawn from each other school area, not by consider-\nations of space and program only.\" Id. at 1108. Additionally, the dis-\ntrict court’s order directed that \"[r]eassignments to optional schools\nmust not jeopardize the racial composition of any other school.\" Id.\nThese modifications, however, at no time set a racial ratio of the type\ndisapproved of by the district court in its earlier orders and by the\nSupreme Court in its 1971 review of the district court’s 1970 order.10\n  10\n     I also disagree with the assertion that the Supreme Court’s disap-\nproval of inflexible racial quotas as a desegregation tool is solely a limi-\ntation on a district court’s remedial power. While the Swann Court did\nimply that a school board, exercising its discretion, could \"conclude . . .\nthat in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each\nschool should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflect-\ning the proportion for the district as a whole,\" 402 U.S. at 16, this is cer-\ntainly not the state of the law today nor was it the state of the law in 1992\nwhen the magnet plan was adopted.

From this\nlanguage, CMS concludes that strict quotas were permitted. CMS’s\nconcentration on just a portion of the relevant language (\"at or\nabove\") edits out the word \"approximately,\" which does not suggest\nrigidity. Even if Exhibit A could be read as requiring rigid quotas,\nCMS disregards the fact that the district court approved the guidelines\n\"subject to the further conditions stated\" in the 1974 order.

Prevailing case\nlaw required that the racial classification be narrowly tailored to achieve\na compelling state interest. See J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 494. And\nas demonstrated in section III.B, the admissions policy was in no sense\nnarrowly tailored.\n   11\n      In contending that rigid ratios were not used by CMS, several of my\ncolleagues observe that not a single magnet school achieved the precise\nratio of sixty percent white students and forty percent black students.\nThis is not surprising insofar as the policy was designed to leave seats\nvacant. The very act of leaving seats vacant will compel a deviation from\nthe stated goal. However, this in no way undermines a finding of rigidity.\nInstead, such a result illustrates the policy’s inflexibility.\n\f54      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\napplicants an otherwise available slot in a magnet program solely on\naccount of the applicant’s race. Both the district court and the\nSupreme Court in this very case consistently rejected the use of such\nrigid racial quotas.\n\n   I also find no authorization for the board’s adoption of the magnet\nschools program in the Supreme Court’s 1971 approval in Swann of\na majority-to-minority transfer policy that would prevent, for exam-\nple, an African-American child in a majority white school from trans-\nferring to a majority black school because the transfer would increase\nthe degree of segregation in the affected schools. See Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 26. Because the majority-to-minority transfer policy, like the mag-\nnet admissions policy, prevents a child from enrolling in the public\nschool of his choice, CMS argues that the magnet admissions policy\nis permissible. By definition, however, CMS’s specialized magnet\nprograms are not tantamount to conventional public schools. While a\nchild denied a transfer from one conventional school to another still\nreceives the same general education, a child denied admission to a\nspecialized magnet program does not receive a similar benefit in a\nconventional school. In other words, an education in a magnet school\noffering, for example, foreign language immersion, is not inter-\nchangeable with an education in a conventional public school.12\nHence, the effect of the magnet admissions policy is far different from\nthe majority-to-minority transfer policy.\n\n   Unfortunately, the end result of the challenged magnet schools\nadmissions policy is placement of racial quotas ahead of educating\nstudents—an inappropriate result nowhere countenanced in the dis-\ntrict court’s orders or in the Supreme Court’s desegregation decisions.\nCf.

Equal Protection\n\n   Having determined that the CMS officials are not entitled to immu-\nnity for the implementation of the strict race-based magnet school\nassignment policy, I now turn to the question of whether the officials’\nact of implementing the policy without prior court approval, albeit\nwhile under an order to desegregate schools, runs afoul of the Equal\nProtection clause. I would hold that it does.\n\n   Under the Fourteenth Amendment, \"[n]o State shall . . . deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S.\nConst. amend XIV, § 1.

CMS avers that the magnet admissions policy\nwas adopted to remedy the effects of the dual school system previ-\nously operated in Mecklenburg County. Without question, remedying\n\nequal protection via \"appropriate legislation,\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV,\n§ 5, the Supreme Court in interpreting the Fifth Amendment held Con-\ngress to the same rigorous standards applicable to states and localities.\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224 (observing \"that any person, of whatever\nrace, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the\nConstitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to\nunequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny\").\n  CMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that strict scrutiny does not\napply when a school district is under court order to dismantle the dual\nsystem. Such an approach, however, ignores two of the three pillars of\nSupreme Court’s equal protection analysis: skepticism of all racial pref-\nerences and consistent application of heightened scrutiny regardless of\nthe race of the person burdened or benefitted. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at\n223-24. Contrary to the assertions of CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, the\napproach I would adopt does not deprive a school board under court\norder of the necessary tools required to establish a unitary school system.\n    The point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the gov-\n    ernment in support of a racial classification, and the evidence\n    offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to\n    distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in govern-\n    mental decisionmaking. . . . Strict scrutiny does not \"trea[t] dis-\n    similar race-based decisions as though they were equally\n    objectionable\"; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all govern-\n    mental race-based decisions in order to decide which are consti-\n    tutionally objectionable and which are not.\nId. at 228 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). This careful\nevaluation demanded by the Supreme Court will preserve inviolate\nproper desegregation remedies while ensuring that in the process of\ndesegregating a government actor does not stand equal protection on its\nhead by denying some students educational opportunities solely because\nof their race.\n\f58      BELK v.

Like the district court, I would hold that the CMS magnet\nadmissions policy is not narrowly tailored to the compelling interest\nof remedying past discrimination.\n\n   First, the magnet admissions policy was not necessary to comply\nwith the court’s order to dismantle the dual educational system. CMS\nhad a number of options available to it that would not have deprived\nchildren, solely on account of their race, an available seat in a special-\nized magnet program. Instead, CMS opted for rigid racial limits that\nwere clearly prohibited by the district court’s orders and the Supreme\nCourt’s desegregation decisions. Nor is there evidence in the record\nthat added flexibility or a waiver provision would have undermined\nthe use of magnet schools as a desegregation technique. The evidence\nsimply does not reveal that the magnet admissions policy used was\nthe only efficacious option available to CMS.\n\n  Second, this circuit has emphasized that \"[t]he use of racial prefer-\nences must be limited so that they do not outlast their need; they may\n\f        BELK v.

Like the district court, I can find \"no mention of the\nduration that CMS would use racially segregated lotteries, vacancies,\nand waiting lists.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 290. In light of\nCMS’s desire to remain under court order for the indefinite future, see\nsupra Part II.H, the lack of a duration for the magnet admissions pol-\nicy is not surprising. CMS was apparently content, in a number of\ninstances, to leave available magnet seats empty despite the waiting\nlists.\n\n   Third, I agree with the district court that \"the 60-40 numerical goal\nis related to the relevant population, i.e., the racial composition of\nschoolchildren in CMS.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 289. How-\never, there is no evidence that CMS considered the \"practicability of\nachieving this precise ratio in every magnet school,\" id. at 290, or the\nvery real danger that magnet schools would be underutilized because\nseats would be left open despite an abundance of applicants. The\nresult of the admissions policy is but another indication that the CMS\nadministration, in the words of former Superintendent Murphy, \"was\nmore focused on balance than on [educational] outcomes.\" J.A. VI-\n2687.\n\n   Fourth, the district court aptly described the inflexibility in the\nmagnet admissions policy: \"The Court is hard-pressed to find a more\nrestrictive means of using race than a process that results in holding\nseats vacant while long waiting lists full of eager applicants are virtu-\nally ignored.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 289. The policy is\nindeed \"restrictive,\" but it also borders on obduracy. The policy con-\ntained no written waiver provision which, once again, shows a lack\nof concern that these highly specialized schools could and would be\nunderutilized.\n\n   Finally, the innocent parties affected are children denied magnet\nslots solely because of their race and parents who \"must wait for\nmonths without knowing where their children eventually will be\nplaced.\" Id. at 290. A child’s education is one of the greatest concerns\nof the family, and CMS unnecessarily causes much agonizing when\nit places children of the \"wrong color\" on waiting lists while it\n\f60      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\nactively recruits children of the \"right color\" to fill empty magnet\nschool seats.\n\n   In sum, the magnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored. The\npolicy is not necessary to dismantle the de jure system, is for an\nunlimited duration, provides for virtually no flexibility, and burdens\ninnocent children and their families. The policy quixotically purports\nto establish equal protection of the laws in the realm of public educa-\ntion by denying children an equal opportunity to compete for open,\nunclaimed slots in CMS’s extraordinary magnet schools. The with-\nholding of seats from white students after all African-American chil-\ndren wishing seats have been given them is most certainly not a\nnarrowly tailored program. Such a result calls to mind why strict scru-\ntiny is used in the first place: \"Of all the criteria by which men and\nwomen can be judged, the most pernicious is that of race.\" Maryland\nTroopers Ass’n v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607120\"><a href=\"/opinion/607120/maryland-troopers-association-incorporated-the-coalition-of-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1072</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1076 (4th Cir. 1993). Teach-\ning young children that admission to a specialized academic program\nwith available seats is contingent on their race is indeed pernicious,\nand CMS’s magnet admissions policy can in no way be described as\nnarrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of remedying past\ndiscrimination.15\n\n                   C. Award of Nominal Damages\n\n   After finding a constitutional violation in the magnet schools, the\ndistrict court held CMS \"nominally liable in the amount of one dol-\nlar.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 290. CMS argues that the nomi-\nnal damages awarded were unjustified because the actions resulting\nin a constitutional violation were taken in good faith.

See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 289.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1420</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). Assuming without deciding whether\ndiversity may be a compelling state interest, I would hold that the magnet\nadmissions policy again fails because it is not narrowly tailored. Whether\nthe interest is remedying past discrimination or diversity, the admissions\npolicy as currently written is in no sense narrow. It is difficult to imagine\nany interest for which the magnet admissions policy is narrowly tailored.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     61\nthe damages award will \"open the door to numerous suits by other\nstudents who could claim that they did suffer actual damages and\nargue that collateral estoppel prevents CMS from denying liability.\"\nDefendants-Appellants’ Brief at 24. Regarding nominal damages, the\nSupreme Court has observed:\n\n    Common-law courts traditionally have vindicated depriva-\n    tions of certain \"absolute\" rights that are not shown to have\n    caused actual injury through the award of a nominal sum of\n    money. By making the deprivation of such rights actionable\n    for nominal damages without proof of actual injury, the law\n    recognizes the importance to organized society that those\n    rights be scrupulously observed; but at the same time, it\n    remains true to the principle that substantial damages should\n    be awarded only to compensate actual injury or, in the case\n    of exemplary or punitive damages, to deter or punish mali-\n    cious deprivations of rights.\n\nCarey v. Piphus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109815\"><a href=\"/opinion/109815/carey-v-piphus/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (1978) (nominal damages avail-\nable for denial of procedural due process rights) (footnote omitted);\nsee also Price v.

In\norder to recover nominal damages, Cristina Capacchione need not\nprove that absent the unconstitutional policy she would have been\nadmitted to the magnet program. The injury in the present case is not\nthe ultimate inability to enroll in the magnet school, but the inability\nto compete for seats on an equal basis. See Northeastern Florida\nChapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1993). Though the two open \"black seats\" at the\nOlde Providence magnet school were eventually awarded to white\nchildren, the fact remains that the official magnet admissions policy\nprohibited children like Cristina from competing for the open slots.\nIn fact, CMS left the two available \"black seats\" at Olde Providence\n\f62      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nunfilled for most of the summer while Cristina and over one hundred\nother white children languished on a waiting list. In Orwellian fash-\nion, CMS marketed Olde Providence as \"a school to benefit every-\none,\" but in reality permitted only a select few to compete for the\nbenefits bestowed.\n\n   The nominal award in this case recognizes the importance of equal\nprotection under the law and provides some measure of vindication.\nAs for CMS’s worry about collateral estoppel, liability has already\nbeen established, and vacating the nominal damages would not\nchange this. Consequently, I would affirm the district court’s award\nof nominal damages.\n\n                        IV. Injunctive Relief\n\n   After recounting the unitary status determination and the constitu-\ntional violation in the magnet admissions policy, the district court\nenjoined \"CMS from any further use of race-based lotteries, prefer-\nences, and set-asides in student assignment.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 292. CMS challenges the district court’s injunction as\nunwarranted and overbroad. We review the grant of a permanent\ninjunction for an abuse of discretion.

Soc., 343 U.S. at 333.\n\n   The district court’s finding of a threat of future violations centered\non CMS’s offering of diversity as a compelling state interest. This\ninterest was offered after the district court decided that the admissions\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      63\npolicy should be reviewed using strict scrutiny. Because in this circuit\nit is unsettled whether diversity may be a compelling state interest,\nsee Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Pub. Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766841\"><a href=\"/opinion/766841/jeffrey-eisenberg-on-behalf-of-jacob-eisenberg-and-elinor-merberg-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130\n(4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1420</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), it was improper\nfor the district court to base its injunction on CMS’s unsuccessful\ndefense of the policy. At this point, we can discern nothing in the\nrecord indicating that CMS will ignore the district court order and\ncontinue to use race in an unconstitutional manner in the operation of\nthe magnet schools or other schools in the system. CMS represented\nto the district court both during and after trial that it had no intention\nof continuing the magnet plan. In moving for a stay of the injunction,\nCMS did not ask that the injunction be stayed as to the magnet\nschools, and was prepared to comply immediately with the court’s\norder. CMS requested a stay as to the non-magnet schools because\nover 50,000 students were likely to be reassigned in a short period of\ntime. Moreover, there was no evidence presented at trial about what\nCMS proposed to do as a unitary school system. A post-unitary status\nstudent assignment plan was never given to the district court, and the\nevidence simply does not indicate that \"there is an imminent threat of\nillegal action.\" Bloodgood, 783 F.2d at 475.\n\n   A finding of unitariness brings a fresh start for the school board—\nan opportunity to operate a school system in compliance with the\nConstitution. The prospective relief awarded by the district court is in\ntension with the resumption of local control, which is one of the ulti-\nmate goals of any desegregation order. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490.\nFreeing the school district from one court order only to shackle it with\nanother was here an abuse of the district court’s discretion, and we\ntherefore vacate the grant of injunctive relief.\n\n                       V. Discovery Sanctions\n\n   The district court sanctioned CMS for failing to supplement its\nanswers to interrogatories that sought a list of witnesses. We review\nthe district court’s management of discovery under the abuse of dis-\ncretion standard. See Anderson v. Foundation for Advancement, Educ.\n& Employment of Am. Indians, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757769\"><a href=\"/opinion/757769/paull-anderson-v-foundation-for-advancement-education-and-employment-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504 (4th Cir. 1998).\nThe record reveals that no list of fact witnesses was presented to the\nplaintiff-intervenors until five days before the trial date. At that time,\nCMS presented a list of 174 witness, which was later cut to twenty-\n\f64      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nsix. The plaintiff-intervenors moved for sanctions and the district\ncourt granted the motion in part. The district court continued the trial\nfor one week so that the plaintiff-intervenors could depose the newly\ndisclosed witnesses, and the court held CMS accountable for the fees\nand expenses of these depositions.\n\n   We have developed a four-part test for a district court to use when\ndetermining what sanctions to impose under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 37. Specifically, \"[t]he court must determine (1) whether\nthe non-complying party acted in bad faith, (2) the amount of preju-\ndice that noncompliance caused the adversary, (3) the need for deter-\nrence of the particular sort of non-compliance, and (4) whether less\ndrastic sanctions would have been effective.\" Id. An examination of\nthe four factors reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court.\n\n   First, there is ample evidence of bad faith. Early in the case, the\nplaintiff-intervenors presented CMS with an interrogatory asking for\ndisclosure of trial witnesses. In response to the interrogatory, CMS\nstated that it would provide appropriate information concerning wit-\nnesses at the time and in the manner specified by the district court.\nThe plaintiff-intervenors moved to compel discovery, and the court\nagreed with CMS that the request was premature. However, the court\ninstructed CMS to \"supplement its responses [to the interrogatories],\nas it promised, when such information becomes known.\" J.A. I-195.\nAs an excuse for its untimely disclosure of fact witnesses, CMS relies\non the district court’s pre-trial order, which provides that \"[a] witness\nlist containing the name of every proposed witness\" should be filed\nwith the court on the first day of trial. J.A. I-150. This provision of\nthe pre-trial order was clearly for the court’s convenience and could\nnot reasonably be interpreted to apply to disclosures to the other par-\nties. Besides, even if such an interpretation were reasonable, the dis-\ntrict court’s command to supplement interrogatories superceded the\npre-trial order. Accordingly, bad faith is evident.\n\n   Second, the presentation of such a lengthy witness list on the eve\nof trial to the plaintiff-intervenors was prejudicial. Without the action\nof the court, the plaintiff-intervenors would have had no opportunity\nto depose the witnesses, much less properly prepare for trial. Thus,\nCMS’s failure to supplement interrogatories was prejudicial.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      65\n   Third, such non-compliance with the district court’s orders cer-\ntainly needed to be deterred. The district court’s condonation of\nCMS’s bad faith at a time so close to the beginning of trial could have\nencouraged repetition of improper conduct. As found by the district\ncourt, the record indicates that the failure to supplement interrogato-\nries was not the first time CMS \"was lacking in candor in disclosing\nrelevant and important information.\" J.A. I-305. Hence, deterrence\nwas essential to a proper management of this case.\n\n  Finally, less drastic sanctions would not have been effective. Per-\nmitting the plaintiff-intervenors to depose witnesses and requiring\nCMS to pay fees and expenses for the depositions was appropriate.\nCMS was fortunate to receive such a light sanction, and it is doubtful\nwhether lesser measures would have had any effect on CMS’s con-\nduct.\n\n  In sum, the discovery sanctions imposed did not amount to an\nabuse of the district court’s discretion.\n\n                          VI. Attorney Fees\n\n   CMS argues that the district court erred in awarding attorney fees\nto the plaintiff-intervenors. While conceding that Grant is entitled to\nfees if the district court’s unitary status finding is upheld, CMS argues\nthat Capacchione cannot be a prevailing party on this issue. CMS also\nchallenges Capacchione’s receipt of fees based on the district court’s\nmagnet schools ruling because (1) Capacchione received only nomi-\nnal damages, and (2) young Capacchione would not have been admit-\nted to the magnet program even if race was not a factor insofar as her\nlottery number was so high. The district court’s decision to award\nattorney fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Hitachi\nCredit Am. Corp. v.

Surprisingly, despite CMS’s concession, a\nmajority of this court vacates the award of fees to both Capacchione\nand Grant.\n\n   By obtaining a declaration of unitary status, the Grant plaintiffs,\nalong with Capacchione, finished what the original Swann plaintiffs\nstarted. If we deny the plaintiff-intervenors the ability to be compen-\nsated in a situation such as this—where an incredible amount of legal\nwork is required and the board, for improper reasons, clings to the\ncourt’s order—then we give to litigants like the Swann plaintiffs\neffective control over the decision of \"when\" or even \"if\" a unitary\nstatus hearing will be sought because they would be the only ones\nwho could ever obtain reimbursement for their legal fees. The practi-\ncal consequences are scarcely more apparent than in this case, where\nthe only party ruled entitled to obtain attorney fees for finishing the\njob was opposed to seeing unitary status declared. This, coupled with\nthe fact that the plaintiff-intervenors received a court order in their\nfavor on the unitary status question as a continuation of the original\n§ 1983 action, leaves me at a loss to see how the district court’s award\nof attorney fees to them under § 1988 can be reversed.\n\n   Under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988(b) (West Supp. 2000), \"[i]n any action\nor proceeding to enforce a provision of [§ 1983 and other civil rights\nlaws] . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party,\nother than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the\ncosts.\" To be considered a prevailing party, a party must \"succeed on\nany significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit\nthe parties sought in bringing suit.\" Farrar v.

The district court granted\nthe Swann plaintiffs’ motion and later permitted Capacchione to inter-\nvene in Swann. Grant, who also sought a declaration of unitary status,\nthen moved to intervene in the consolidated action, and the district\ncourt granted his motion. After months of litigation, the plaintiff-\nintervenors succeeded in having CMS declared unitary, and this court\nhas affirmed on appeal.\n\n   With the prior court orders now dissolved, CMS must cease using\nthe orders to assign Grant’s children as well as all other public school\nstudents on account of their race.16 A unitary school system is what\n  16\n    CMS argues that because Capacchione no longer resides in North\nCarolina the unitary status declaration does not alter CMS’s behavior\ntoward young Capacchione and consequently Capacchione is not a pre-\nvailing party entitled to fees. In other words, CMS contends that Capac-\nchione’s lack of standing counsels against an award of fees. I disagree.\nAt the very least, because of Capacchione’s status as a plaintiff-\nintervenor in Swann, Capacchione is still entitled to fees. See Shaw v.\nHunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757571\"><a href=\"/opinion/757571/ruth-o-shaw-melvin-g-shimm-robinson-o-everett-james-m-everett-dorothy/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (4th Cir. 1998) (noting that when plaintiffs with\nstanding \"secure[ ] precisely the relief that they sought,\" plaintiff-\nintervenors who lack standing but contributed to the litigation may also\nbe awarded attorney fees). Grant, who CMS concedes has standing and\nis entitled to fees, achieved the relief originally sought—a declaration of\nunitary status. Capacchione greatly contributed to this result, and under\nShaw is entitled to fees just as Grant.\n\f68      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nthe original plaintiffs sought in 1965, and the plaintiff-intervenors\nhave greatly assisted in the final stages of this litigation in making\nunitariness a reality. Henceforth, unless CMS’s use of racial classifi-\ncations satisfies the requirements of strict scrutiny, the color of a\nchild’s skin will no longer be a permissible basis for assigning, or\nrefusing to assign, a child to a conventional public school or a special-\nized magnet program. See Farrar, 506 U.S. at 110 (observing that\ndeclaratory relief may constitute relief under § 1988 \"if[ ] it affects\nthe behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff\") (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Moreover, this declaration of unitary status is\nenforceable against CMS in the unlikely event it later attempts to con-\ntinue prior assignment polices, say, on the ground that vestiges of\nprior discrimination have not been eradicated. See id. at 111 (explain-\ning that to be a prevailing party an enforceable judgment must be\nobtained).\n\n   In the present case, with its counter-intuitive alignment of parties,\nthe plaintiff-intervenors have stepped into the shoes of the Swann\nplaintiffs, continued the original § 1983 action, and brought this case\nto a close.

Here, the plaintiff-\nintervenors observed CMS’s progress in dismantling the dual system,\nand once convinced that full compliance had been achieved, they\nmoved for a declaration of unitary status. In so doing, the plaintiff-\nintervenors were faced with a recalcitrant school board that insisted\nnone of the Green factors had been satisfied. The Swann plaintiffs,\nthough having never returned to court to complain about the continua-\ntion or revival of segregative practices, suddenly claimed that the dual\nsystem was not being dismantled and joined the school board in the\nquest for continuation of court supervision. Though most of the vital\ninformation was in the hands of CMS’s officials, who were often\nuncooperative in the discovery process, see Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

But for the actions of the plaintiff-\nintervenors, CMS, though having dismantled the dual system, would\nstill be using the district court’s orders as mechanisms for attaining\nother goals. Despite the progress of the last three decades, CMS was\napparently content to forestall a finding of unitariness for the foresee-\nable future. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490 (observing that restoration\nof local control \"at the earliest practicable date\" is a goal of any\ndesegregation order). Consequently, I believe that the plaintiff-\nintervenors, for stepping in and finishing what was begun in 1965, are\nentitled to attorney fees under § 1988 for their litigation of the unitary\nstatus issue.\n\n                                    2.\n\n   I would also affirm the plaintiff-intervenors’ award of attorney\nfees, based on the unitary status declaration, under this circuit’s\nexceptional circumstances doctrine. See Rolax v. Atlantic Coast Line\nR.

A contrary result would hamper the involvement of concerned\ncitizens in school desegregation litigation and permit school boards\nthat are inclined to remain under court order to eschew a unitary sta-\ntus hearing.\n\n   I recognize that the Supreme Court recently rejected the catalyst\ntheory as a basis for awarding attorney fees. See Buckhannon Bd. &\nCare Home v. West Virginia Dep’t of Health & Human Res., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1835</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001). However, the award of fees in the present case has\nnever been based on the catalyst theory, \"which posits that a plaintiff\nis a prevailing party if it achieves the desired result because the law-\nsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant’s conduct.\" Id.\nat 1838 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, there was no\nvoluntary change in CMS’s conduct. CMS clung to the desegregation\norders and put up a vigorous defense in the course of a two-month\ntrial. A final judgment was handed down, and any change in CMS’s\nbehavior will be due to the district court’s decree, not a voluntary act.\nWhile a \"voluntary change in conduct . . . lacks the necessary judicial\nimprimatur on the change\" for a plaintiff to be considered a prevailing\nparty, a declaration of unitary status is far different. Id. at 1840. Once\nfound to be in violation of the Constitution, a school district cannot\nbe declared unitary without the order of a court. Because the district\ncourt’s order, and not a voluntary act, is the impetus behind any\nchange, the rejection of the catalyst theory in Buckhannon does not\nundermine an award of attorney fees based on the exceptional circum-\nstances doctrine of Rolax.\n\n        B. Attorney Fees for the Magnet Schools Litigation\n\n   I would also find that Capacchione is entitled to fees because he\nis a prevailing party on the magnet schools issue. The district court\nheld that the magnet schools admissions policy violated the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and awarded nomi-\nnal damages in light of the constitutional violation. In Farrar, the\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     71\nSupreme Court specifically addressed the issue of nominal damages\nand prevailing party status:\n\n    We therefore hold that a plaintiff who wins nominal dam-\n    ages is a prevailing party under § 1988. . . . A plaintiff may\n    demand payment for nominal damages no less than he may\n    demand payment for millions of dollars in compensatory\n    damages. A judgment for damages in any amount, whether\n    compensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant’s behav-\n    ior for the plaintiff’s benefit by forcing the defendant to pay\n    an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\n\n506 U.S. at 112-13 (internal citations omitted). The award of nominal\ndamages constitutes relief on the merits and affects CMS’s behavior\ntoward Capacchione if only by forcing CMS to pay. Hence, Capacch-\nione is a prevailing party. See also Shaw v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757571\"><a href=\"/opinion/757571/ruth-o-shaw-melvin-g-shimm-robinson-o-everett-james-m-everett-dorothy/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164\n(4th Cir. 1998) (noting that \"persons within the generic category of\nplaintiff-intervenors have often been found by courts to fit within the\nrubric ‘prevailing party’ for fees purposes\"). That young Capacchione\nhad a high lottery number is irrelevant for a determination of prevail-\ning party status. As previously stated, the injury in this case was the\ninability to compete for open magnet seats, not the denial of admis-\nsion to a magnet program. Because I would find that Capacchione\nrightly prevailed on the magnet schools issue, I would affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s award of attorney fees for work in this area as well.\n\n                                  VII.\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, a majority of this court affirms the dis-\ntrict court’s declaration of unitary status and the imposition of discov-\nery sanctions. We vacate the district court’s injunction because we\ncan discern no danger of future violations. Additionally, I would\naffirm the finding of a constitutional violation in the magnet schools\nadmissions policy, the award of nominal damages, and the attorney\nfees awarded pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988.\n\nWILKINSON, Chief Judge, concurring in part:\n\n   I concur in Parts I, II, IV, and V of Judge Traxler’s thorough opin-\nion.

Those holdings\nproperly emphasize the ecumenical premise of the Fourteenth\nAmendment that every American citizen regardless of race or ethnic-\nity is deserving of equal dignity under the law.\n\n   The more difficult question is whether the adoption of the magnet\nschool program in 1992, at a time when the school board was under\na court desegregation order, stripped the Board of its immunity. I\nwould hold that it did not. Inasmuch as the Board did not forfeit its\nimmunity, I would vacate the award of damages against it and the\nfees and costs assessed thereon.1\n\n   Both the Supreme Court’s Swann opinion and various lower court\nopinions relied for many years upon numerical benchmarks as an\nindicia of progress in achieving school desegregation. That emphasis,\nhowever, was primarily the work of the courts, not the school board.\nAnd judicial decisions further made clear that the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg school board could take the numerical approach of the\ncourts even further in the course of devising desegregative remedies\nof its own.\n\n  For instance, in Swann, the Supreme Court itself held that: \"School\nauthorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate\n  1\n    Although the Grant plaintiffs have prevailed with regard to the unitary\nstatus determination, their basis for prevailing was not an action under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.

It is true\nthat in the early 1990’s, the school board in its magnet program\neagerly accepted the courts’ invitation to rely upon numerical bench-\nmarks. I believe, however, that it is necessary to afford a school board\nsome latitude in attempting to meet its desegregative obligations if we\nare not to undermine the rule of law. To do otherwise leaves the\nBoard between a rock and a hard place. Namely, if the school board\nfails to carry out the court desegregation order, it can be cited for con-\ntempt or held not to have achieved unitariness. But if the Board acts\naggressively to implement the court order, it risks facing judicial con-\ndemnation and the threat of litigation on the grounds that it was acting\nultra vires. This is not the kind of quandary into which we should\nforce institutions that are, for better or worse, under judicial decree.2\nSuch an approach risks undermining respect for courts and, indeed,\nencouraging just the opposite.\n\n   My fine colleague, Judge Luttig, insists that the issue here has\nsolely to do with racial quotas. I have strongly disapproved of the use\nof such quotas. See, e.g., J. A. Croson Co. v.

Indeed\nI believe them to be inimical to a national future founded, as the Four-\nteenth Amendment requires, upon individual respect and mutual self-\nregard. Yet to see the sole issue here as racial quotas is to miss the\nforest for the trees. The cumulative message of innumerable court\norders conveyed to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg board over the course\nof many years was to do everything possible to desegregate Charlotte\nschools. See, e.g., Swann, 402 U.S. at 15 (\"[S]chool authorities are\n‘clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps\n  2\n    The quandary in fact is illustrated by this very case where five mem-\nbers of the court feel the Board went too far in its remedial efforts, and\nfour others believe just as strongly that the Board did not go far enough.\n\f        BELK v.

To now condemn the\nBoard would be to sanction the future disrespect and disregard for\ncourt orders of all sorts. This I am unwilling to do.\n\n    If an existing court order is infirm, the better course is to modify\nit through customary court processes. Today, we follow this approach\nwith our determination that the school district has attained unitary sta-\ntus. This holding puts the school district on a race-neutral footing\ngoing forward, thereby granting it a truly fresh start. The solution to\nthe fundamental Fourteenth Amendment problems with the 1992\nmagnet school plan is not to hold the Board liable for its attempts to\nimplement the very policies, and attain the very ends, which the\ncourts had ordered it to do. The answer is to point to a unitary future\nin which the principle of non-discrimination will guide its public\nactions.\n\n                                    II.\n\n   I concur fully in Judge Traxler’s view that the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg school system has achieved unitary status. I recognize\nthat some citizens of Charlotte, aware of society’s shortcomings on\nmatters of race, may see in unitariness a mocking phrase. Others may\nview today’s embrace of local governance as an act of judicial aban-\ndonment. The luminosity of Brown v. Board of Education is such that\nmany have come to look at courts as our sole guiding lights. Yet they\nwere never meant to be such. If it was important that courts nurture\nthe task of desegregation in its infancy, it is equally essential that a\nschool district one day depart the comforting judicial homestead and\nstrike out on its own. School districts will be stronger for finding their\nown way. For in the long run, courts cannot serve as the sole source\nof hope in the difficult area of desegregation, nor democracy as the\nobject of fear. \"Returning schools to the control of local authorities\nat the earliest practicable date is essential to restore their true account-\nability in our governmental system. When the school district and all\nstate entities participating with it in operating the schools make deci-\nsions in the absence of judicial supervision, they can be held account-\n\f76      BELK v.

The district court concluded that it was. See Rid-\ndick v. School Bd. of the City of Norfolk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465182\"><a href=\"/opinion/465182/paul-r-riddick-jr-and-phelicia-riddick-infants-by-paul-r-riddick/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (4th Cir.\n1986) (holding that the district court’s unitary status finding is\nreviewed for clear error). It is, I suppose, possible for us to reweigh\nthe evidence or to refract this or that school board decision through\na myriad of lenses. While any record, thus dissected, would be found\nto reveal its share of imperfection, a reversal of the district court’s\nfinding of unitariness would do a profound disservice to the people\nof Charlotte. The recent history of Charlotte, as Judge Traxler’s care-\nful opinion demonstrates, is not one of resistance and intransigence.\nRather it shows a community struggling to meet its desegregative\nobligations in a period of staggering demographic change. Most\nimportantly, African Americans are vigorous participants both in the\nelective and deliberative process with regard to Charlotte’s schools.\n\n   Of course, the majority’s sense of progress may be the dissent’s\nsense of great unfinished business. And let us suppose just for a\nmoment that both are right. Still, I doubt that interminable court pro-\nceedings can convey to Americans the sense that we are in the enter-\nprise of education together. For litigation depends for its energy on\nadversarial alignments, i.e., the school board and Swann plaintiffs are\ntentatively aligned, but the Swann plaintiffs and Capacchione plain-\ntiffs are decidedly not. And while democracy has no shortage of con-\nflict, reaching decision and compromise from within the community,\nas opposed to the external compulsion of court order, promises a bet-\nter mutual understanding and a firmer common ground.\n\n   That at least is the hope. In this sense, then, unitariness is not an\nact of abandonment but a covenant of faith. It reflects a judicial belief,\nwell supported by this record, that the invidious practices of an inde-\nfensible era have indeed been dismantled and that Charlotte has\nearned the right to begin anew. No decisions are more sensitive and\ndifficult than those involving public schools, and no process is more\nwrenching than that of matching limited resources to a limitless array\nof educational needs. But these challenges are better met by commu-\nnities than by courts and, after thirty-five years of sporadic judicial\n\f        BELK v.

A copy of relevant parts of that order is also attached as\nExhibit B.\n\f78     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   I vote to affirm the judgment of the district court in each respect,\nincluding the sanctions order, except that I would vacate the judgment\nof the district court as to Item 4, listed in Part I above, only on the\nground it is unnecessary, the school board having given no indication\nthat it will not comply with the orders of the court in this case.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   Despite universally accepted appellate procedure that we review\njudgments, not opinions, the other members of this court, without\nmention of the judgment of the district court, have divided a per\ncuriam opinion into four issues, only the last two of which, concern-\ning injunctive relief and sanctions, relate directly to the judgment of\nthe district court we are reviewing. The first two issues, as stated in\nthe per curiam opinion of the court, are phrased by a floating major-\nity.\n\n   Only because each of those majorities declines to vote to affirm or\nreverse the various items of the judgment of the district court, I will\nattempt to relate my votes to the per curiam opinion.\n\n   As to Item 1, I vote that the school system has achieved unitary sta-\ntus. Also as to Item 1, I vote that the attorneys’ fees for work done\non the unitary status issue, and any other issue tried in this case,\nexcept a few dollars relating to Miss Capacchione’s moving, should\nbe granted. The majority, however, while it denies fees on \"the uni-\ntary status issue,\" apparently does not immediately mention the fees\nof Miss Cappacione’s attorneys, amounting to the sum of about\n$700,000, and one might think from reading the per curiam opinion\nthat they were yet awarded were it not for the next-to-the-last line of\nthe per curiam opinion denying fees \"for any reason.\"\n\n   As to Item 2 of the per curiam opinion, I am in agreement with the\ndistrict court, that the school board should have come back to it for\nauthority to establish magnet schools in which the race of the appli-\ncant was considered in deciding whether or not to grant admission.\nThe district court so construed its own orders, which it is best able to\ndo, and to which we must give due deference.

Norwood v. Bain, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\n\n    Also as to Item 2, although I feel that the question of immunity has\nlittle or nothing to do with this case, because it is being used to ratio-\nnalize that the successful attorneys do not get their attorneys’ fees and\nthat nominal damages for a Constitutional violation are not due, I vote\nthat the school board did not have immunity from the payment of\nattorneys’ fees, nor immunity from nominal damages, that is to say,\nin the language of the per curiam opinion, it has been forfeited.\n\n  As to Items 3 and 4, the per curiam opinion correctly states my\nvotes.\n\n                                   III.\n\n    With only slight interruptions, this case had been on inactive status\nfor 22 years until Christina Capacchione started the present litigation\nwhen she filed her first complaint on September 5, 1997, seeking to\nbe considered for admission to the magnet school program without\nregard to her race. When, on March 6, 1998, the district court ordered\nthe Swann litigation reactivated, upon the motion of the Swann plain-\ntiffs, it consolidated the Capacchione suit with the Swann litigation.\nMiss Capacchione then amended her complaint on March 16, 1998,\nto request a declaration that the school system had reached unitary\nstatus and moved on March 19, 1998 to intervene in the reactivated\nSwann litigation, which motion was granted. The Grant plaintiffs sub-\nsequently filed their complaint and motion to intervene in the Swann\nlitigation on April 8, 1998.\n\n  When Christina Capacchione filed her suit, the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg schools were only admitting students to the magnet\nschool program after having considered their race, and the school sys-\ntem was submitting itself to the racially-based pupil assignments\nimposed in response to the orders of the district court some years\nbefore, the suit having then been inactive for some 22 years. Now,\nfour years and almost $1.5 million later, and over the determined\n\f80      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nopposition of the school board, the school system has been held to be\nunitary and the magnet schools may no longer consider the race of the\napplicant in granting or denying admission. All this is at the instance\nof Christina Capacchione.\n\n   When the Swann plaintiffs filed their suit in 1965, more than 35\nyears ago, their complaint was that the race of students was consid-\nered in determining their assignment to schools, precisely the same\ncomplaint that Christina Capacchione had in 1997. When the Swann\ncase was declared to be inactive in 1975, the district court, at that\ntime, awarded attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiffs’ attorneys, for\nservice through 1974, in the amount of $204,072.33, and there are\ndoubtless other such items not presently readily available to me. For\nus to hold now that the Capacchione child and the Grant plaintiffs are\nnot entitled to the same consideration, as were the Swann plaintiffs,\nfor eradicating racial assignments is certainly not fair and not even\nlegal, in my opinion. How we are able to hold that the Capacchione\nand Grant plaintiffs and intervenors in this case are not successful\nparties in a § 1983 action strains reason beyond the breaking point. In\nmy opinion, they are due costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees, etc.\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\n  Especially to the holding of the en banc court, that the Capacchione\nand Grant plaintiffs and intervenors are not entitled to attorneys’ fees\nand costs, etc., I respectfully dissent.*\n\n  *My summary of such fees and costs is attached as Exhibit C.\n\f        BELK v.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nLUTTIG, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment in part and dis-\nsenting from the judgment in part:\n\n   I concur in the opinion of the court that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nSchool System is now unitary, following 35 years of federal court\nsupervision. I also agree with the conclusion reached by Judge Trax-\nler that the School Board acted without the required authorization\nfrom the district court both when it created its expansive magnet\nschool program and when it imposed a fixed quota to govern admis-\nsions to that program. Neither the creation of the magnet school pro-\ngram nor the imposition of a rigid quota governing admission into\nthat program were authorized by the district court, and both clearly\nconstituted \"material changes\" from the district court’s prior remedial\norders, requiring prior court approval. I also agree with Judge Trax-\nler’s narrowest conclusion that, absent a proven necessity for such, an\nadmissions program that permanently employs fixed ratios to deny\ncertain students, solely because of their race, the opportunity to com-\npete for seats that will otherwise be left unfilled even after all targeted\nminorities have been allotted seats (and I assume fixed ratios in a\nremedial context to be constitutional), is insufficiently tailored to\nwithstand scrutiny.\n\n  I address myself separately only to the question whether the district\ncourt authorized the strict mathematical quota adopted by the School\nBoard in 1992 to govern admissions to Charlotte-Mecklenburg’s mag-\n\f        BELK v.

Indeed, the court\nobserved, \"it was not uncommon for the school year to begin with\nseats remaining vacant because students of one race would disrupt the\ndesired racial balance.\" Id. Accordingly, the district court held that the\nmagnet school program constituted a \"material departure\" from the\ncourt’s prior remedial orders. Id. at 287.\n\n   As to whether the rigid quota imposed by the School Board was\nauthorized by the district court, the question is not whether the court’s\norders authorized race-conscious admission decisions, as the School\nBoard argues, see Br. of Appellants Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of\nEducation, et al. at 20 (\"The particular desegregation tool struck\ndown by Judge Potter — magnet schools with race conscious admis-\nsions guidelines — has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme\nCourt and other courts as a valid exercise of the broad remedial dis-\ncretion of both district courts and school authorities.\"), and as Judge\nMotz and Judge Wilkinson contend by way of strawman. It is indispu-\ntable that race-conscious admission decisions were authorized by the\ndistrict court’s orders; not even the plaintiffs argue that they were not.\nNeither is the question whether parties are required to obey court\norders, the only question addressed by the authorities relied upon by\nJudge Motz; of course, they are. Nor is the question whether quotas\nwere \"foreclosed\" by the district court’s orders, as Judge Wilkinson\n\f90      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nalternatively maintains; it should be evident that a party does not\nreceive immunity for any and all conduct that is merely unforbidden\nby judicial order.\n\n   And finally, the issue is not whether racial quotas are or are not\nconstitutional. There simply is no occasion in this case for a general\nexpression of viewpoint as to the use of racial quotas and, although\nI am given pause over Judge Wilkinson’s express and categorical\nrejection of racial quotas, whatever the circumstance, I certainly\nexpress no such general view herein. I might well be presented with\ncircumstances in which I would conclude that racial quotas were\nessential to the vindication of constitutional right. And I would be\nmost reluctant to foreclose myself from such a conclusion in an\nappropriate circumstance by statements in a case in which the issue\nwas not even before the court.\n\n   Rather, the only issue relevant to the question of whether the\nSchool Board is entitled to immunity is whether the district court spe-\ncifically authorized the School Board’s imposition of rigid quotas\n(i.e., whether the Board was acting pursuant to court order in impos-\ning the fixed quotas), which denied students the opportunity to com-\npete for unfilled seats solely because of their race. If the court did\nspecifically authorize the use of fixed quotas, then the School Board\nis entitled to immunity; if it did not, then immunity is unavailable.\nThe authorities on this score are uniform.

Whether racial quotas are, as a general matter,\nconstitutional has nothing whatsoever to do with the resolution of this\nissue. If the district court authorized strict racial quotas, then the\nSchool Board is entitled to immunity whether or not such strict quotas\nare constitutional.\n\n   Judge Wilkinson misunderstands this issue altogether, as is evident\nfrom both his extended and unnecessary discussion of racial quotas\nin general and his mistaken observation that I \"insist\" \"the issue here\nhas solely to do with racial quotas.\" Judge Motz, in contrast, under-\nstands the issue presented, but errs in its resolution because of a reli-\nance upon fundamentally inapplicable authorities.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   Most certainly the district court did not specifically authorize the\nSchool Board to employ fixed quotas in the admission of students to\nits magnet schools, as the district court itself held. There is not even\nan argument that it did. Indeed, although fatal to their holding that the\nboard is entitled to immunity, Judges Motz and Wilkinson do not\neven suggest otherwise. Nor could they.\n\n   Not only the very district court in question, but the Supreme Court\nof the United States itself in this very litigation, both explicitly and\nconsistently disavowed the use and constitutional legitimacy of rigid\nquotas throughout the thirty-plus year history of Charlotte-\nMecklenburg’s desegregation efforts. In fact, in the course of this\nvery litigation, even the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board has\nstrenuously argued against the fact and the constitutionality of any\njudicially-imposed quotas by the district court.\n\n                                   A.\n\n  Beginning over thirty-two years ago, in this identical litigation,\nJudge McMillan himself acknowledged the well-recognized and well-\nunderstood distinction between race-conscious decisions and rigid\nquotas, which is ignored by Judge Motz and variously ignored and\nmisunderstood by Judge Wilkinson today. And he could not have\n\f92     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nbeen clearer that he would permit the former in pursuit of integration\nof the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, but forbid the latter —\nand he never wavered from that position.

See id. at 267-68.\n\n   And a year later, Judge McMillan again explicitly rejected fixed,\nrigid quotas, re-emphasizing that \"‘racial balance’ is not required by\nthis court.\" Swann v.

Fully aware that the Supreme Court\nhad forbidden imposition of quotas, the School Board itself did not\neven request authorization to impose strict quotas. Tellingly, the\nBoard only submitted for the district court’s approval a policy requir-\ning that each school maintain a black student population of \"at or\nabove approximately 20%.\" To anyone familiar with the history of the\nlitigation, and especially the Supreme Court’s then-recent explicit\nrejection of any construction of Judge McMillan’s orders that would\nimpose a quota on the School Board, as was the School Board, the\npurposeful distinction between race consciousness and rigid quota\ndrawn by Judge McMillan in his 1974 order could not be any clearer.\n\n                                  III.\n\n   Indeed, foregoing the implausible arguments embraced by the\nmajority, not even the School Board seriously argues before us that\nthe district court authorized strict quotas — which should be unsur-\nprising, given its own argument as early as 1970 that such were\nunconstitutional and its firsthand knowledge that the Supreme Court\nhad categorically rejected the use of such in this very litigation. To\nthe Board’s credit, it does not even attempt the argument made by\nJudges Motz and Wilkinson that the language of the district court\norders itself authorized quotas. Rather than focus on whether the dis-\ntrict court orders imposed or authorized rigid quotas, as to which it\nsays nothing, the Board noticeably and notably passes instead to the\nvery different argument that its admission policies were not, as a prac-\ntical matter, tantamount to insistence upon rigid quotas as evidenced\nby the ultimate variation in the racial make-up of the magnet schools.\nSee Appellants’ Reply Br. at 15; Appellants’ Br. at 21 (suggesting\nthat the \"manner in which CMS admitted students to its magnet\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      97\nschools was fully consistent with these orders and not rigid and\ninflexible\" because of the existence of \"[s]ignificant variance\" from\nthe initial goal). This \"[s]ignificant variance,\" of course, is not due to\nthe flexibility of the admissions process, but instead to its rigidity to\nthe extent of leaving unfilled seats that were reserved for a particular\nrace, even in the face of a waiting list of students of different races.\nIn any event, the ultimate demographics have no relevance whatever\nto the threshold question before us of whether the district court did\nor did not specifically authorize the Board to employ rigid quotas in\nadmissions to its magnet schools — a question as to which the School\nBoard’s silence speaks volumes.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n   The facts of the repeated explicit and consistent rejection of quotas\nby this district court in this very litigation for over thirty years; the\ncategorical rejection by the Supreme Court of the United States of any\nconstruction of the district court’s orders that would require rigid quo-\ntas; the School Board’s own argument before the Supreme Court in\nSwann that rigid quotas were never intended or ordered by the district\ncourt, and that, if they had been, such would be unconstitutional; and\nthe Board’s tacit (and frankly, candid, if indirect) concession in its\nbriefs before this court that the district court did not authorize rigid\nquotas, renders beyond any argument the plaintiff’s contention that\nthe School Board acted outside the scope of the district court’s orders\nwhen it adopted rigid quotas and refused to permit students to com-\npete for open seats based upon their race alone. Not merely had the\ndistrict court never authorized the School Board’s use of rigid quotas.\nIt had expressly stated that it would not do so, as the Board itself\nknew well. And, if this alone were not enough, at this very School\nBoard’s behest, the district court had been instructed by no less an\nauthority than the Supreme Court of the United States that it would\nhave been without the constitutional power to impose such an inflexi-\nble requirement on the county officials of Charlotte-Mecklenburg,\neven had it wanted to. The holding on this record that the district\ncourt authorized the use of strict quotas is, as best evidenced by the\npalpable lack of support summoned by the combined opinions of\nJudges Motz and Wilkinson on behalf of that holding, simply insup-\nportable.\n\f98     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   \"The cumulative message of innumerable court orders conveyed to\nthe Charlotte-Mecklenburg board over the course of many years\"\nactually was not, as Judge Wilkinson asserts, \"to do everything possi-\nble to desegregate Charlotte schools.\" Post at 74. It was to do \"every-\nthing possible\" to desegregate Charlotte-Mecklenburg’s schools,\nexcept employ strict racial quotas.\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ & ROBERT BRUCE KING, Circuit\nJudges:\n\n   A majority of the Court today reverses the district court’s finding\nthat the use of a race-based admission policy by the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education (\"CMS\" or \"Board\") in its expanded\nmagnet schools program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the\nConstitution of the United States — and thus vacates the attendant\ninjunction, monetary relief, and attorney’s fees award. Every signifi-\ncant aspect of the expanded magnet schools program, including the\nuse of racial proportions in assigning students to magnet schools, was\nauthorized by the judicial desegregation orders governing this case.\nThe Board’s obligation to obey these court orders insulates it from\nconstitutional attack for actions taken in compliance with them. It\nwould be the rankest injustice to find the Board liable for a constitu-\ntional violation, and subject to monetary damages and enormous\nattorney’s fees, when its expanded magnet schools program was sim-\nply a good-faith attempt to comply with the desegregation orders\nimposed by federal courts to remedy an unlawful dual school system.\nThus, for the reasons more fully explained in parts III, IV, V, and VI\nof this opinion, the magnet schools ruling must be reversed and the\naccompanying injunction, monetary damages, and attorney’s fees\naward must be vacated.\n\n   However, a separate majority severely errs in upholding the district\ncourt’s determination that CMS has achieved unitary status. This\nmajority expresses its \"satisfaction that CMS has dismantled the dual\nschool system.\" Traxler Op. at 7. For the reasons set forth in parts II\nand VIII of this opinion, no one should be satisfied at this time. Noth-\ning yet demonstrates that CMS has eliminated all vestiges of the\nunlawful discrimination that has long permeated its school system. In\nholding to the contrary, the majority has only succeeded here in dash-\ning the hopes of the citizens of Mecklenburg County, particularly\n\f        BELK v.

These successive generations\nof parents and children have been slowly starved by a well-meaning\n— but irresolute — governing body, whose sins have been absolved\nby the court below (and now by a majority of this Court) without any-\nthing but the most cursory examination. Although CMS has clearly\nachieved unitary status in certain respects, there remain several areas\nof primary concern that have not been subjected to anything\napproaching a proper constitutional analysis.

But the linchpin of\nthis plan was its grant of permission to each student — regardless of\nrace — to freely transfer to a different school (often described as a\n\"freedom of choice\" plan). Id.

The court ordered CMS to work actively to inte-\n       grate the faculties, so that \"a child attending any school\n       in the system will face about the same chances of having\n       a black or a white teacher as he would in any other\n       school.\" Id.\n\n     • School siting: The court underscored that the desirability\n       of implementing a \"neighborhood school\" policy, under\n       which efforts were made to locate schools in neighbor-\n       hoods and within walking distance for children, could\n       not override the constitutional duty to desegregate. Id. at\n       1369. At the same time, CMS was not to avoid locating\n       new facilities in black neighborhoods. Id. at 1371.\n\nIn light of Green, Judge McMillan also ordered CMS to submit a\nnew, amended desegregation plan, and he outlined certain possible\nremedies, including busing and re-zoning.

Id. at 1298-99. In approving the plan on an interim\nbasis, the district court noted that black children were bearing a dis-\nproportionate burden of the desegregation efforts, but the court none-\ntheless concluded that some action — even if interim — was\npreferable to none at all. Id. at 1298. Judge McMillan also ordered the\nBoard to submit another desegregation plan within three months.\n\n   In November and December 1969, the district court determined\nthat the school system’s compliance with the interim desegregation\nplan was unsatisfactory, finding that the Board was continuing to per-\npetuate segregation:\n\n      The School Board is sharply divided in the expressed views\n      of its members. From the testimony of its members, and\n      from the latest report, it cannot be concluded that a majority\n      of its members have accepted the court’s orders as repre-\n      senting the law which applies to the local schools. By the\n      responses to the October 10 questions, the Board has indi-\n      cated that its members do not accept the duty to desegregate\n      the schools at any ascertainable time; and they have clearly\n      indicated that they intend not to do it effective in the fall of\n      1970. They have also demonstrated a yawning gap between\n      predictions and performance.\n\nSwann, 306 F. Supp. at 1306. At that time, the district court also\nreviewed and rejected the Board’s newly submitted amended desegre-\ngation plan. Id. at 1313-14. Then, the court appointed Dr. John A.\nFinger, Jr. as an expert consultant to prepare a more acceptable plan.\nThis appointment came nearly two years after the Supreme Court’s\nGreen decision and more than fifteen years after Brown I.\n\n   The district court ultimately adopted Dr. Finger’s proposed plan for\nelementary schools and the Board’s plan, as modified by Dr. Finger,\nfor secondary schools (collectively the \"Finger Plan\").

Second, \"no school [could] be\noperated with an all-black or predominantly black student body.\" Id.\nThird, in redrawing the school system’s attendance zones, the Board\nwas authorized to use bus transportation and noncontiguous \"satellite\nzones\"3 to accomplish its goals. Id. Fourth, the district court restricted\nthe student transfer policy in order to safeguard against resegregation.\nId. at 268-69. Fifth, the race of faculty members at each school had\nto approximate the ratio of black and white faculty members through-\nout the system. Id. at 268. Sixth, the overall competence of teachers\nat formerly black schools could not be inferior to those at formerly\nwhite schools. Id. Finally, the district court mandated that the Board\nmonitor and report on its progress in implementing the plan. Id. at\n269.\n\n   The Finger Plan was challenged on several occasions and, in 1971,\nthe Supreme Court upheld it as a valid exercise of the district court’s\nequitable powers.

Although Judge McMillan approved the incor-\nporation of these schools into the plan, he cautioned that the optional\nschools would be inconsistent with the school board’s constitutional\nobligations if they merely served to re-institute \"freedom of choice.\"\nId. at 1104 (\"‘Freedom of choice’ was a synonym for segregation for\nmany years, and . . . it should not be resurrected at this late date sub\nnom. ‘optional schools’ without adequate safeguards against discrimi-\nnatory results.\"). To ensure that the optional schools served their\nstated purpose of furthering the process of desegregation, Judge\nMcMillan decreed that \"optional school enrollments will be con-\ntrolled starting with 1974 so that they . . . have about or above 20%\nblack students.\" Id.\n\n   Finally, in July 1975, over twenty years after the mandate of Brown\nII, Judge McMillan for the first time observed, albeit with reserva-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    107\ntions, that the Board was actually working toward desegregation:\n\"The new Board has taken a more positive attitude toward desegrega-\ntion and has at last openly supported affirmative action to cope with\nrecurrent racial problems in pupil assignment.\" Swann v.

Id. at 649-50. In so acting, the\ncourt reaffirmed that its orders still stood: \"[t]his case contains many\norders of continuing effect, and could be re-opened upon proper\nshowing that those orders are not being observed.\" Id. at 649.\n\n                                   4.\n\n  Between 1975 and 1992, two significant actions were taken in con-\nnection with the CMS desegregation litigation.\n\n                                   a.\n\n   First, in 1978, a group of white parents and children brought suit\nagainst CMS, seeking an order prohibiting the Board from assigning\nchildren pursuant to the Board’s latest student-assignment plan.

Supp. at 1321. The Swann plain-\ntiffs intervened in Martin, joining the Board’s opposition to the con-\ntentions of the Martin plaintiffs. Id.\n\n   A brief review of Spangler and Bakke is necessary to an under-\nstanding of Martin. In Spangler, the Supreme Court held that because\nthe Pasadena Unified School District (\"PUSD\") had achieved racial\nneutrality in its school attendance pattern, \"the District Court was not\nentitled to require the PUSD to rearrange its attendance zones each\nyear so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by the court was main-\ntained in perpetuity.\" 427 U.S. at 436. All parties in Spangler agreed\nthat the plan initially achieved racial neutrality in student attendance;\nnonetheless, the district court had believed it was empowered to annu-\n\f108      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION\nally readjust school boundaries to ensure in perpetuity that there\nwould be no majority of any minority race at any Pasadena school.\nId. at 433, 436. In Bakke, the Supreme Court determined that a public\nuniversity with no history of discrimination could not constitutionally\nreserve sixteen out of one hundred admission slots for racial minori-\nties. 438 U.S. at 319-20. In striking down this admissions plan, the\nCourt had made clear that \"[w]hen a classification denies an individ-\nual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely because of his\nrace or ethnic background, [it must] be regarded as [constitutionally]\nsuspect.\" Id. at 305.\n\n   Judge McMillan, who retained jurisdiction over Swann and pre-\nsided over Martin, first held that because CMS had not achieved\nracial neutrality in student attendance, consideration of race in student\nassignment policies was appropriate under Swann. See Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380773\"><a href=\"/opinion/380773/george-martin-for-himself-and-in-behalf-of-his-minor-children-ellen-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1980).\nHe explained that because the student assignment policy in the CMS\nschool system had been independently adopted by the Board, it was\nnot established, as the Spangler policy had been, via judicial coercion\nor order. 475 F. Supp. at 1340-43. Second, Judge McMillan ruled that\nBakke was inapposite to the claims of the Martin plaintiffs. Specifi-\ncally, the court reasoned that no child was being denied access to\nequal educational opportunity because of race, see id. at 1321, and the\nactions of the Board were therefore not constitutionally suspect under\nBakke.\n\n   In upholding the independent actions of the Board, Judge McMil-\nlan made several important findings. For example, he found that dis-\ncrimination had not ended; indeed, it was this very finding that led the\ncourt to uphold the 1978 race-conscious student assignment policy.\nId. at 1346-47. Also, although for the first time the district court\npraised the efforts of the Board without reservation, it underscored yet\nagain the need for patience and continued efforts:\n\n      It took three centuries to develop a slave culture, to fight a\n      bloody civil war, and to live through the century of racial\n      turmoil after that war.\n\n                                  ***\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     109\n     The culture and attitudes and results of three centuries of\n     segregation cannot be eliminated nor corrected in ten years.\n     Human nature and practices don’t change that fast, even in\n     the hands of people of good will like the members of the\n     present School Board. They need time to work their own\n     experiments, and to find their own ways of producing the\n     sustained operation of a system of schools in which racial\n     discrimination will play no part. I vote to uphold their\n     efforts to date, and to give them that time.\n\nId. at 1347. In 1980, we affirmed the district court’s decision in Mar-\ntin. See 626 F.2d at 1165.\n\n                                    b.\n\n   The second significant phase of litigation between 1975 and 1992\nwas initiated in 1980. At that time, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs\nnotified the district court that the black student population in CMS\nelementary schools had grown from twenty-nine percent to forty per-\ncent, making it increasingly difficult to comply with the desegregation\norder’s mandate to avoid majority-black elementary schools. In\nresponse to this change, Judge McMillan approved a modification to\nthe desegregation plan. Instead of prohibiting a \"predominantly black\nstudent body,\" the court permitted CMS to operate elementary\nschools with a black student population of \"plus 15 percent\" above\nthe district-wide average. Thus, if the school district averaged forty\npercent black students, any individual school could have fifty-five\npercent black students.\n\n                                    5.\n\n   From 1981 to 1992, the Board continued to operate its desegrega-\ntion plan as approved by the district court, focusing, inter alia, on sat-\nellite attendance zones, a feeder plan (assigning middle-school\nstudents from a certain neighborhood to identified high schools),\nschool closings, and construction of new schools. Then, in 1992,\nCMS substantially increased its reliance on \"optional\" or magnet\nschools (the \"expanded magnet schools program\"). The Board placed\nnew emphasis on magnet schools in order to phase out \"pairing\" and\nheavy reliance on busing, and to give parents more choice in school\n\f110     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nselection. It was the expanded magnet schools program that ultimately\nled to the present phase of this litigation.\n\n                                    6.\n\n   In September 1997, William Capacchione, individually and on\nbehalf of his daughter Cristina, sued CMS claiming that Cristina was\nunconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school. Christina is\nHispanic and Caucasian, and her suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 sought\ndeclaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. In response, CMS\nmoved to dismiss Capacchione’s suit and, almost simultaneously, the\nSwann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann, claiming that CMS was\nnot yet in compliance with past desegregation orders and had not yet\nachieved unitary status. Because Judge McMillan had died, the cases\nwere assigned to Senior Judge Robert D. Potter, who restored Swann\nto the district court’s docket, consolidated the cases, denied CMS’s\nmotion to dismiss, and granted Capacchione’s motion to intervene.4\n\n   The Capacchione plaintiffs claimed that CMS had long since elim-\ninated the vestiges of segregation in its schools, and that its formerly\ndual system of white and black schools had, for some time, been uni-\ntary. They also contended that CMS, while still operating under the\ncourt’s desegregation orders, had violated those orders and the consti-\ntutional rights of white students in its efforts to desegregate the school\nsystem by employing a race-conscious assignment lottery in its\nexpanded magnet schools program. The Swann plaintiffs countered\nthat the school system had not yet achieved unitary status. CMS\nacknowledged that it was not yet in compliance with past desegrega-\ntion orders and agreed that it should not be declared to have achieved\n  4\n   Since filing suit, the Capacchiones have moved to California. Based\non that fact and other findings, the district court determined that William\nCapacchione no longer possessed standing to seek injunctive or declara-\ntory relief, but that he did have standing to pursue compensatory relief.\nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416911/capacchione-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Another group of white parents intervened in the con-\nsolidated action and that group, represented by plaintiff Michael Grant,\nclaimed that CMS has achieved unitary status. The various groups of\nplaintiffs that have joined in Capacchione’s claims are hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the Capacchione plaintiffs.\"\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     111\nunitary status. CMS also contended that, in any event, the expanded\nmagnet schools program constituted an entirely constitutional and\nappropriate integration tool authorized under the desegregation orders\nin this case. The Swann plaintiffs, while endorsing the concept of\nmagnet schools, argued that the expanded magnet schools program,\nas implemented, was contributing to the resegregation of the school\nsystem.\n\n   Following a bench trial conducted from April 19 to June 22, 1999,\nthe court, on September 9, 1999, filed its Memorandum of Decision\nand Order, from which this appeal is taken. See Capacchione v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416911/capacchione-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In its ruling, the district court then\nfound that the Board’s expanded magnet schools program, even\nthough instituted to effect court-ordered desegregation, was unconsti-\ntutional. Furthermore, the court enjoined the Board from \"assigning\nchildren to schools or allocating educational opportunities and bene-\nfits through race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other\nmeans that deny students an equal footing based on race.\" Id. at 294.\nFinally, the court awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs nominal mone-\ntary damages and substantial attorney’s fees.\n\n                                    C.\n\n   The Board and Swann plaintiffs appealed every portion of the dis-\ntrict court’s judgment. A panel of this Court, with one judge dissent-\ning, vacated and remanded the district court’s unitary status\ndetermination, holding that the district court’s unitary status findings\nwere insufficient with respect to student assignment, facilities, trans-\nportation, and student achievement. The panel also reversed the dis-\ntrict court’s holding that the expanded magnet schools program\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause, reasoning that the program com-\nplied in all respects with court orders governing the case and did not\nin any way violate the Constitution. Finally, the panel vacated the dis-\ntrict court’s injunction, the award of nominal damages, and the award\nof attorney fees. See Belk v.

No deference,\nhowever, is owed to the district court on conclusions of law, including\nthe district court’s understanding of controlling law or the various\nburdens of proof and presumptions; consequently, all such conclu-\nsions of law are reviewed de novo. See, e.g., In re Brice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765773\"><a href=\"/opinion/765773/in-re-paul-b-brice-jewel-h-brice-debtors-thomas-l-blair/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                   A.\n\n                                   1.\n\n   Indisputably, the school system of Charlotte-Mecklenburg County\nsubjected African-Americans to nearly a century of segregation and\ndiscrimination. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized as much in\nSwann, noting that North Carolina was one of the states with \"a long\nhistory of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system\ndeliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate\npupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\" 402 U.S. at 5-6. In this\ncontext the remedies forcefully endorsed in Brown II, including the\nuse of race-conscious measures, are necessary to eradicate the invidi-\nous segregation at which they are aimed.\n\n   Moreover, court supervision over local school boards, also\nembraced in Brown and its progeny, is entirely appropriate whenever\n\"school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations\" \"to take what-\never steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination would be eliminated.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 15.\nNot only are the federal courts entitled to supervise and direct the\nactions of local school boards under those circumstances, but the\nscope of federal authority is almost plenary: \"Once a right and a vio-\nlation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable pow-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD            OF   EDUCATION     113\ners to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are\ninherent in equitable remedies.\" Id. There is no doubt that CMS was\njustifiably subjected to federal court supervision; in fact, even after\nthe Board had been subjected to court supervision, it had to be repeat-\nedly ordered to begin the process of desegregation.\n\n   Ultimately, however, the goal in a desegregation case such as this\nis to reach the point at which federal supervision is no longer war-\nranted and the use of race-conscious measures is no longer necessary.\nSee Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489. The Supreme Court has identified six\nfactors (collectively the \"original Green factors\") that must be free\nfrom racial discrimination before the mandate of Brown is met: (1)\nstudent assignment, (2) physical facilities, (3) transportation, (4) fac-\nulty, (5) staff, and (6) extracurricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at\n435. Not only are reviewing courts to ascertain whether these original\nGreen factors are free from racial discrimination, but courts also are\nentitled, in their discretion, to identify other factors (\"ancillary factors\")5\nand \"determine whether minority students were being disadvantaged\nin ways that required the formulation of new and further remedies to\nensure full compliance with the court’s decree.\" 503 U.S. at 492.\n\n                                      2.\n\n   For school systems proceeding through the difficult process of\ndesegregation, the Supreme Court has adopted the goal of achieving\nunitary status. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 486-87; Board of Educ. of Okla.\nCity v. Dowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245-46 (1991). Although prior to the\nCourt’s Dowell and Freeman decisions federal courts used the term\n\"unitary status\" somewhat inconsistently, see Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n486-87; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, the term has now come to mean\nthat the school system has been unified such that the vestiges of seg-\nregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 487; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38. When a school system\nachieves unitary status, federal courts must withdraw supervision over\nthe local school board.\n  5\n   For convenience, we refer to the original Green factors and any ancil-\nlary factors identified by the district court as \"Green factors.\"\n\f114     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   In this case, Judge Potter declared that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus in every respect. The Supreme Court has directed that an appel-\nlate court review a district court’s unitary status determination by\napplying a two-part inquiry (the \"Freeman inquiries\"). An appellate\ncourt must determine if (1) a school Board has, in good faith, com-\nplied with the desegregation decree since it was entered; and (2) the\nvestiges of de jure segregation in the school system have been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50).\n\n   If the party seeking a declaration of unitary status cannot demon-\nstrate that the school system has achieved unitary status in its entirety,\nwe then undertake to determine whether the school system has\nachieved unitary status with respect to one or some of the Green fac-\ntors (\"partial unitary status\"). At that point, we apply, with respect to\neach Green factor, the two Freeman inquiries along with one addi-\ntional Freeman-mandated inquiry: \"whether retention of judicial con-\ntrol [over one aspect of the school system] is necessary or practicable\nto achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school\nsystem.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491. This third Freeman inquiry rec-\nognizes that the Green factors are — to a great extent — interrelated,\nand when determining whether judicial supervision over a school\nboard may be withdrawn, the overlap between the Green factors is a\ncrucial consideration.\n\n    The Freeman analysis brings us to the most difficult questions\npresented in any desegregation case: whether present racial isolation\nis a vestige of past segregation and, if so, whether a school board can\npracticably reduce that racial isolation. It is even difficult to define\n\"vestige\" in this context. See id. at 502 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"We\nhave never sought to describe how one identifies . . . a ‘vestige’ or\na ‘remnant’ of past discrimination. . . .\"). The vestiges \"that are the\nconcern of the law may be subtle and intangible but nonetheless they\nmust be so real that they have a causal link to the de jure violation\nbeing remedied.\" Id. at 496 (Kennedy, J.); see also id. at 512 (Souter,\nJ., concurring) (citing Columbus Bd. of Educ. v.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    115\n\"vestige\": it is a condition or occurrence causally related to the former\nde jure system of segregation.\n\n   Because a school system’s duty to eliminate such vestiges is\nrestricted by the availability of practicable measures for doing so, see\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492, it is also incumbent on us to consider prac-\nticability. In determining the practicability of further measures, the\ndistrict court must look to numerous indicia of the system’s operation.\nPracticability depends on the feasibility of the proposed method, from\nboth a financial and an administrative perspective. Cf. id. at 481-83,\n493-97. Whether a measure is practicable also depends on whether it\nis \"directed to curing the effects of the specific violation,\" and\nwhether it is likely to do so. Id. at 497.\n\n   Our duty, in reviewing Judge Potter’s decision, see Capacchione,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 228, is clear. We must examine each Green factor\nand ascertain whether unitary status has been achieved with respect\nto any or all of them. Because the district court declared the entire\nCMS school system to have achieved unitary status, we must assess,\nwith respect to each Green factor, whether the Board has complied,\nin good faith, with the desegregation decree and whether the vestiges\nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50). If the\nschool system has not achieved unitary status in its entirety, then,\nconsistent with Freeman, we also must weigh the degree of interre-\nlatedness existing between the various Green factors.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   By way of introduction to our analysis of this case, we first address\na fundamental flaw in the district court’s proceedings — a flaw aris-\ning from the district court’s failure to give any consideration to a\nremedial plan sought to be admitted as evidence by CMS. Following\nthe filing of the Capacchione plaintiffs’ Complaint in Intervention,\nthe Board undertook to produce a comprehensive analysis of whether\nvestiges of de jure segregation existed in CMS and whether any such\nvestiges could be practicably remedied. The Board analyzed available\ndata and identified several vestiges remaining; then, in line with the\nmandate of Freeman, the Superintendent of CMS developed a plan\ncontaining practicable remedial steps. The Board independently\n\f116     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nreviewed this plan and, on March 30, 1999, adopted the \"Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Schools’ Remedial Plan to Address the Remaining Ves-\ntiges of Segregation\" (the \"Plan\" or \"Remedial Plan\"). J.A. 11029.\n\n   Consistent with pretrial deadlines, CMS filed the Remedial Plan\nwith the district court as a potential exhibit at trial. J.A. 11028. At the\npretrial conference conducted on April 13, 1999, the Capacchione\nplaintiffs moved in limine to exclude the Remedial Plan. In essence,\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs maintained that the trial had been bifur-\ncated into two phases and that only unitary status was at issue in the\nfirst phase. They further maintained that the Remedial Plan contained\nproposed remedies that could only be implemented if CMS was deter-\nmined not to have achieved unitary status. Because the unitary status\nquestion had not yet been resolved, they claimed that the Remedial\nPlan (which the Capacchione plaintiffs characterized as a damages\nreport) was irrelevant.\n\n   In opposing exclusion of the Remedial Plan, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs relied on the Supreme Court’s Freeman analysis. J.A. 1421.\nSpecifically, they asserted that each unitary status determination\nencompassed in the first phase of the trial turned on \"whether the ves-\ntiges have been remedied to the extent practicable.\" Id. (emphasis\nadded). The Remedial Plan, they claimed, was not merely relevant,\nbut crucial, to establishing both the existence of vestiges of segrega-\ntion and the practicability of remedial measures.\n\n    Judge Potter responded with two rulings. First, Judge Potter\nexplained in assessing whether CMS had achieved unitary status that\nhe believed Freeman required him to consider just one thing: \"only\n. . . what CMS has done, not what it may do in the future.\" See Order\nof April 14, 1999 at 4. Second, based on this understanding of Free-\nman and the unitary status test, Judge Potter concluded that the Reme-\ndial Plan was irrelevant: \"If the Court later determines that additional\nremedial measures are needed, it may consider the plan. Until that\ntime comes, however, the Court will not get mired in the complex\ndetails and mechanics of a proposed plan.\" Id. at 5.6\n  6\n   Judge Potter also chided CMS for proffering the Remedial Plan \"after\nthe deadline for fact discovery and expert witness discovery had\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     117\n  We believe Judge Potter erred in both of these rulings. First, he\nmisapprehended Freeman and its test for unitary status. At the outset,\nFreeman explicitly rejects, as a matter of law, the very analysis\nadopted by the district court. That is, under Freeman, a district court\nmust consider (1) compliance with prior orders (i.e., \"what CMS has\ndone\"), and (2) whether vestiges have been eliminated to the extent\npracticable (i.e., \"what [CMS] may do in the future\"). See Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 491; see also Order of April 14, 1999 at 4. By construing\nFreeman’s unitary status test to include the former (\"what CMS has\ndone\") but not the latter (\"what [CMS] may do in the future\"), Judge\nPotter erred as a matter of law.\n\n   The Remedial Plan directly addresses the latter inquiry, and it does\nso in an apt, informed manner, relying on the considered opinions of\nhighly capable professionals retained to analyze the latest available\ndata. In other words, the district court’s second reason for excluding\nthe Plan — relevancy — also fails to withstand scrutiny.7 There is no\n\nexpired.\" On the contrary, CMS fulfilled all of its duties under the fed-\neral rules, appropriately supplementing its responses to discovery\nrequests as soon as the Remedial Plan had been adopted. Furthermore,\na more precipitant proposal could not have incorporated the various\nexpert perspectives developed during discovery. A similar plan submit-\nted earlier in the course of the litigation necessarily would have been\nbased largely on speculation and supposition, and therefore would have\nbeen far less useful and pertinent. As it was, the Plan was tendered in\nadvance of the non-jury trial, and, of great significance, almost five\nmonths before the district court issued its decision. Neither the court nor\nthe parties could have been inconvenienced by the necessary timing of\nthe Remedial Plan’s submission.\n   7\n     Taking the district court at its word that the only question before it\ninitially was the extent of the Board’s compliance with the prior desegre-\ngation orders, the Remedial Plan was nonetheless highly relevant for\neven that purpose. The ease with which some of the proposed Plan reme-\ndies could be realized, e.g., merely distributing available funding to\naddress the stark disparity in basic resources such as instructional materi-\nals and media centers, see J.A. 11040, strongly suggests that the Board\nhad not fully implemented the long-standing dictates of the prior orders.\nThe court nonetheless observed that \"while the goal of perfect compli-\nance with court orders has remained elusive, no evidence has been pre-\n\f118     BELK v.

Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any ten-\ndency to make the existence\" of any material fact \"more probable or\nless probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Consequently,\nrelevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. See,\ne.g., United States v.

The Remedial Plan identified record evi-\ndence (including the deposition testimony of several experts) support-\ning the Board’s belief that vestiges of de jure segregation in CMS\nremain apparent in (1) faculty assignment and quality, (2) physical\nfacilities and the allocation of instructional resources, (3) student\nachievement, and (4) student assignment. More importantly, the\nRemedial Plan detailed specific steps that the Board proposed to\nundertake over the course of the ensuing five years \"with a goal of\nachieving unitary status at that time.\" J.A. 11029.\n\n   Without a doubt, federal courts possess the final word in deciding\nwhether a particular school system is operating within the parameters\nof the Constitution. Appreciable weight must be given, however, to\nthe views of those selected by the community to administer the sys-\ntem.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    119\ndistrict court erroneously failed to accord the Board’s official position\nany weight, much less the respect that it was due.\n\n   That the district court so completely disregarded this crucial evi-\ndence is telling. Nonetheless, ever mindful of the deference accorded\nthe factfinder, we embark upon the task of examining the court’s con-\nclusions.\n\n                        1. Student assignment\n\n   Of all the Green factors, the most prominent is the degree of racial\nimbalance in student assignment. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474. Unifor-\nmity in the racial composition of a given school was the hallmark of\nofficial discrimination, \"for under the former de jure regimes racial\nexclusion was both the means and the end of a policy motivated by\ndisparagement of, or hostility towards, the disfavored race.\" Id. Court-\nordered desegregation was designed to meet the enemy head-on; the\nlong-term stability of attempts at racial balancing in student assign-\nment is often seen as the most conspicuous indication of the courts’\nsuccess (or lack thereof) in combating the underlying societal evil.\n\n   The fundamental questions before us are whether present racial iso-\nlation in CMS may be a vestige of the former dual system, and, if so,\nwhether there are practicable measures CMS could take to reduce or\neliminate that isolation. In considering these questions, we are bound\nto focus particularly on the Board’s record of compliance with the\ndistrict court’s desegregation orders. See id. at 492 (citing Dowell).\nBecause significant and growing racial imbalances in student assign-\nment do exist in CMS, because the Board for decades has failed to\ncomply with certain specific decrees of the district court (particularly\nregarding the siting of new schools), because these failures may have\ncontributed to current racial isolation, and because future compliance\nmight practicably reduce this racial isolation, we would vacate the\ndistrict court’s finding that CMS has achieved unitary status with\nrespect to student assignment.\n\n                                   a.\n\n  In the wake of the 1970 desegregation order, virtually all of the\n\f120     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nschools in CMS operated in racial balance for a considerable time. By\n1998-99 however, nearly thirty percent of the schools in the system\nhad become racially identifiable.9 Of the 126 schools included in the\nCMS desegregation plan, twenty-three are identifiably black and thir-\nteen more are identifiably white. J.A. 11587. Further, virtually all of\nthe identifiably black schools are located in either the inner city or in\nthe immediate northwest-to-northeast suburbs, the areas of Mecklen-\nburg County with the highest concentration of African-Americans. In\nstark contrast, all thirteen of the identifiably white schools are found\nin the extreme northern and southern areas of the county, both of\nwhich (and particularly the latter) have seen dramatic increases in\nwhite population during the past thirty years. The trend in CMS\ntoward resegregation of its schools has accelerated markedly since the\nmove to de-emphasize satellite zones and mandatory busing in 1992.\nIn the last seven years, the number of CMS African-American stu-\ndents who attend racially identifiable schools (now almost three in\nten) has risen fifty percent. J.A. 9589.\n\n   Indisputably, from 1981 until 1997, the CMS school system went\nthrough significant demographic changes. For example, the total pop-\nulation of Mecklenburg County has grown from 354,656 in 1970 to\n613,310 in 1997. J.A. 16247. Almost 100,000 children attend CMS,\nmaking it the twenty-third largest school system in the country. J.A.\n7107. During the period from 1970 to 1997, the black school-age pop-\nulation (ages 5 through 17) in the county has increased by approxi-\nmately 10,000. J.A. 16247. Over the same period, the corresponding\nwhite school-age population has decreased by approximately 3,000,\nid., and by 1997, African-Americans comprised 34 percent of the\ncounty’s school-age population, the total of which numbered approxi-\nmately 108,600. Evidence before the district court revealed that, since\n1970, the growing African-American population has migrated out-\nward from the inner city into formerly white suburbs. In turn, many\n  9\n   Judge McMillan’s final desegregation order mandated, inter alia, that\nno school should become \"racially identifiable.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at\n268. Judge Potter interpreted the phrase synonymously with \"racially\nimbalanced,\" which, as noted within, describes a school with an African-\nAmerican student population deviating more than fifteen points in either\ndirection from the county-wide norm. See Cappachione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     121\nwhite citizens who formerly populated the city’s periphery have\nmoved even farther into the county’s outlying reaches. Though parts\nof the county have become more integrated as the result of these\nshifts, a disproportionately large number of African-Americans still\nreside in contiguous clusters generally north and west of the down-\ntown area.\n\n   The threshold issue to be addressed is whether the thirty-six\nracially identifiable schools in CMS represent a vestige of segregation\n— that is, whether the present racial isolation is causally related to the\nprior system of de jure segregation. The Swann plaintiffs argue, and\nCMS agrees, that current racial isolation, like the racial isolation of\nthe 1960s and 1970s, results both from past inequities that, to some\nextent, have persisted to this day, and from the Board’s failure to\ncomply with certain specific directives in the remedial decrees in this\ncase.\n\n   Because CMS has not previously been adjudged to have achieved\nunitary status in student assignment, we are bound under Swann to\npresume that the current racial imbalance in the school population\nconstitutes a continuing vestige of segregation. 402 U.S. at 26. The\nCapacchione plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the present\nexistence of predominantly one-race schools in CMS \"is not the result\nof present or past discriminatory action.\" Id.; see also Riddick, 784\nF.2d at 535.\n\n   Our unwillingness to conclude that CMS is unitary with respect to\nstudent assignment centers on the Board’s failure to comply with\ncourt orders regarding selection of sites for the construction of new\nschools. The role of school siting in achieving sustainable desegrega-\ntion should not be underestimated. In fact, the importance of site\nselection has been apparent since the early stages of this case. As the\nSupreme Court explained in 1971:\n\n     In the past [site selection] choices . . . have been used as a\n     potent weapon for creating or maintaining a state-segregated\n     school system. . . . [S]chool authorities have sometimes,\n     since Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to\n     become racially mixed through changes in neighborhood\n     residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied by\n\f122      BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n       building new schools in the areas of white suburban expan-\n       sion farthest from Negro population centers in order to\n       maintain the separation of the races with a minimum depar-\n       ture from the formal principles of \"neighborhood zoning.\"\n       Such a policy does more than simply influence the short-run\n       composition of the student body of a new school. It may\n       well promote segregated residential patterns which, when\n       combined with \"neighborhood zoning,\" further lock the\n       school system into the mold of separation of the races. . . .\n       In ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school seg-\n       regation, the existence of a pattern of school construction\n       and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight.\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 21.\n\n   Subsequent to the Supreme Court’s decision in Swann, Judge\nMcMillan specifically ordered that site selection for new schools\ncould not \"be predicated on population trends alone.\" 379 F. Supp. at\n1107. New schools were \"to be built where they can readily serve\nboth races.\" Id. In the 1979 Martin decision,10 Judge McMillan\ndevoted an entire section of his opinion to demonstrating that \"con-\nstruction, location and closing of school buildings continue to pro-\nmote segregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1329. Judge McMillan explained\nthat \"[t]he location of schools plays a large if not determinative role\nin . . . insuring that any given assignment and feeder plan will provide\nmeaningful desegregation, rather than just the predictably short lived\nappearance of desegregation.\" Id. at 1332.\n\n   In the years since this decree was issued, CMS has built twenty-\nfive of twenty-seven new schools in predominantly white suburban\ncommunities. In the mid-1980s, CMS adopted a formal policy of\n  10\n    Judge Potter incorrectly declared that \"Martin was not a unitary sta-\ntus hearing[.]\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 250. In fact, as the accom-\npanying text indicates, the white parents in Martin contended, as the\nCapacchione plaintiffs do today, that CMS had achieved unitary status.\nIntervening African-American parents, like those herein, maintained to\nthe contrary. In actuality, there is little difference between today’s case\nand Martin, and Judge McMillan’s findings in the latter are as binding\non the parties as any others made in the course of this litigation.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    123\nbuilding \"midpoint\" schools — schools located midway between\nblack and white population centers. There is little evidence, however,\nto suggest that CMS faithfully adhered to this policy. Rather, record\nevidence strongly indicates that the policy influenced the site selec-\ntion for, at most, four of the twenty-seven new schools. See J.A.\n15404-06. Meanwhile, as we discuss infra, there is substantial evi-\ndence that CMS has allowed many of its older school facilities in the\ncity — schools attended in disproportionate numbers by African-\nAmerican students — to fall into a state of disrepair.\n\n   The Board’s record of building the great majority of its new\nschools on the predominantly white suburban fringe of the county\nsupports two possible conclusions. On one hand, CMS could have\nbeen responding to demographic reality — a demand for new class-\nrooms in areas of high population growth (although we note that the\nnumber of white students in CMS has decreased since 1970, while the\nblack student population has greatly increased). On the other hand,\nthe Board’s pattern of school construction could have facilitated or\neven hastened white flight to the suburbs. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Swann, \"[p]eople gravitate toward school facilities, just\nas schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location\nof schools may thus influence the patterns of residential development\nof a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of\ninner-city neighborhoods.\" 402 U.S. at 20-21. The Board’s school sit-\ning policies could well evidence its lack of political will in the face\nof pressure to abandon desegregative policies — pressure from fami-\nlies who \"are concerned about the racial composition of a prospective\nschool and [who] will make residential decisions accordingly.\" Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 513 (Blackmun, J., concurring).\n\n   There is certainly no evidence that CMS has intentionally sought,\nthrough its school siting policies, to \"lock the school system into the\nmold of separation of the races\" in the way that the Supreme Court\ndescribed in Swann, 402 U.S. at 21. But the actual choices the Board\nhas made with regard to school siting may in fact be quite similar to\nthe \"pattern of school construction and abandonment\" described by\nthe Court, with the actual effect that the Court feared of \"lock[ing] the\nschool system\" into a condition of racial isolation. 402 U.S. at 21. We\ncannot conclude, at least in the absence of further fact-finding, that\nCMS, in choosing sites for new schools, has pursued \"meaningful\n\f124     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\ndesegregation, rather than just the predictably short lived appearance\nof desegregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1332.\n\n   Rather, the Board’s practice of siting new schools such that they\ncould not reasonably be expected to serve a racially balanced student\npopulation and Judge McMillan’s determination that this practice, in\nthe past, represented the school system’s failure to eliminate the ves-\ntiges of segregation, together raise a strong inference that those ves-\ntiges remain today. When this inference is viewed in combination\nwith the burden borne by the Capacchione plaintiffs to show that cur-\nrent racial imbalances have no causal link to past discrimination, we\nare compelled to conclude that a remand to the district court is\nrequired.\n\n   Although we defer to a district court’s findings of fact unless\nclearly erroneous, Judge Potter’s error here came in his application of\nthe legal standard to the evidence regarding the Board’s school siting\npolicies. Judge Potter found that (1) CMS had not discriminated on\nthe basis of race in choosing sites for new schools and that (2) CMS\nhad incorporated racial diversity as one of its factors in site selection.\nEven assuming arguendo that both findings are not clearly erroneous,\nneither is sufficient to support the legal conclusion that in siting new\nschools CMS acted in compliance with the governing court orders and\nConstitution to eliminate the vestiges of segregation to the extent\npracticable.\n\n   \"To fulfill this duty, school officials are obligated not only to avoid\nany official action that has the effect of perpetuating or reestablishing\na dual school system, but also to render decisions that further desegre-\ngation and help to eliminate the effects of the previous dual school\nsystem.\" Harris v.

Therefore, CMS had to do more than merely select\nsites for new schools on a nondiscriminatory basis. It had to do more,\ntoo, than simply give some consideration to \"diversity\" in its selection\nof sites. To the extent practicable, CMS had to site new schools\n\"where they can readily serve both races.\" 379 F. Supp. at 1107; see\nalso Swann, 402 U.S. at 21; Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1329-32. Judge\nPotter never found that CMS had met this standard, and as outlined\nwithin, there is substantial record evidence that CMS did not do so.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    125\n   In accordance with Swann, the burden is on the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs to prove that vestiges of past discrimination do not remain, or\nthat nothing can practicably be done to remedy them. We note that\nJudge McMillan, in his last published decision in this case, clearly\nevidenced his understanding both that CMS had not done all that it\ncould do in the area of school siting and that future school siting deci-\nsions could practicably advance the process of desegregation. It was\nthus incumbent on the Capacchione plaintiffs to demonstrate that\nconditions in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County have changed suffi-\nciently such that school siting no longer represents a practicable\nopportunity to eliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs have identified additional areas in which\nCMS has fallen short of its obligations under the court orders. For the\nlife of the desegregation orders, CMS has consistently placed the\nheaviest burden of mandatory busing on African-American students.\nCurrently, 80% of those students who ride the bus as a result of a\nmandatory assignment are African-American. J.A. 11515. Judge\nMcMillan repeatedly ordered CMS to distribute this burden more\nfairly. See 475 F. Supp. at 1339-40; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362 F.\nSupp. at 1232-33. Yet, CMS has utterly failed to do so. In addition,\nCMS has never developed an effective system for monitoring student\ntransfers to ensure that the overall effect of such transfers is not to\nincrease the racial imbalance in the system as a whole. Again, this\nrepresents a failure to comply with the explicit instructions of the dis-\ntrict court. See 475 F. Supp. at 1337-38; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362\nF. Supp. at 1229-30. We are troubled by these failings on the part of\nCMS. They provide additional support for a conclusion that, in the\nface of political pressure, CMS has not done all that it could do to\neliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\n   Finally, the Board has itself taken the remarkable step of admitting\nits noncompliance with prior orders in this case. A school board’s\nfrank acquiescence in a position inuring to its detriment (in this case,\nthe potential of ongoing judicial intervention), if not treated as con-\nclusive, should at least be considered with the utmost gravity. Under\nthese circumstances, we have no difficulty in determining that the dis-\ntrict court’s conclusion that the Board’s level of compliance was \"full\nand satisfactory\" should be vacated.\n\f126     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                                    b.\n\n   If the vestiges of official discrimination have indeed been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable with respect to student assignment,\nthen there is little reason to prolong court supervision. In light of the\ndistrict court’s failure, however, to recognize the Board’s continuing\nnoncompliance with respect to student assignment — administered as\nrecently as twenty years ago in a manner reinforcing the once-official\nnotion that African-Americans are inferior — we have no confidence\nin the court’s ultimate finding that these vestiges have now disap-\npeared.\n\n   The district court neglected to determine whether, since Judge\nMcMillan’s decision in Martin, CMS has fulfilled its constitutional\nand court-imposed obligations with regard to site selection for new\nschools. Had the Board’s efforts been deemed lacking, the court\nbelow should have proceeded to decide whether this failure contrib-\nuted to the present condition of racial isolation in the school system.\nIf the district court then found that CMS had failed to live up to its\nconstitutional and judicially decreed obligations, and if that failure did\ncontribute to the present racial imbalances, then the court was bound\nto further investigate whether proper site selection is a practicable\nremedy for the lingering effects of the Board’s past discriminatory\npractices. Only if proper site selection were not a viable option could\nthe district court have relinquished control over student assignment;\nthere would be nothing further that CMS could practicably do to elim-\ninate the vestiges of the prior de jure system.\n\n   If, however, proper sites were found to be available, then student\nassignment should have remained under the district court’s control. In\nfashioning a remedy, the court might have directed, for example, that\nmost or all new schools constructed over the next several years be\nlocated proximate to the inner city or in midpoint areas already inte-\ngrated residentially. Conversely, the district court might have con-\ncluded that more flexibility is required because of real estate costs,\ncrushing demand in the suburban fringes, or for some other sufficient\nreason. In this vein, the Board’s Remedial Plan could have been con-\nsidered as a limited term remedy for the racial isolation that would\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     127\notherwise continue to exist until the Board’s newly redirected school\nsiting policies can begin to take effect.11\n\n   Should corrective action one day be deemed justified in this case,\nsome reasons will not be sufficient to deny African-American stu-\ndents a remedy. For example, political pressure and perceived resis-\ntance to change by certain groups in the community will not suffice.\nAdditionally, logistical barriers merely making \"difficult\" the trans-\nport inward of outlying white students will likewise, if reasonably\nsurmountable, not be enough.

Judge Potter’s mention of \"previous findings\" refers\nto excerpts from various opinions and orders authored by Judge\nMcMillan:\n  11\n     The strategies described in the Remedial Plan would be of particular\nhelp in deciding whether practicable measures are available. The Plan\nproposes, among other things, to divide Mecklenburg County into three\nto five demographically similar \"clusters,\" within which students may\nchoose to attend any school, magnet or otherwise. Where the demand for\na given school exceeds the available room, spots would be assigned by\nlottery based on factors such as proximity, sibling attendance, and racial,\nethnic, and economic diversity. The Plan also outlines a formal mecha-\nnism to disseminate information regarding the enrollment process, and it\nprovides that the Board will work with the business community and local\ngovernment to secure subsidies for disadvantaged families wishing to\nrelocate to areas in which low-cost housing is scarce.

Following the imposition of judicial\ncontrol, a party seeking to end the status quo bears the burden of over-\ncoming the presumption of causation.

However, that Judge McMillan did not\nintend his initial observations regarding facilities to be construed as\na finding of unitary status is obvious from his subsequent actions. In\n1973, Judge McMillan assumed control over facilities and resources,\nfound inequities, and ordered CMS to remedy those disparities. See\nSwann, 362 F.

Between the commencement of the\ninitial Swann lawsuit in 1965 and the district court’s first mention of\nthe facilities issue in April 1969, CMS closed sixteen black schools.\nThe Board’s en masse action gives rise to an almost undeniable infer-\nence that these schools were shut down because they were inferior,\nand the timing also suggests strongly that the closures were prompted\nby the judicial proceedings then underway.\n\n   Viewed in context, the most plausible conclusion is that the puta-\ntive equality mentioned by the district court in 1969 and 1971 was\nactually an endorsement of the steps that had been taken by the Board\nto remedy the inequities in facilities. In any event, CMS could not be\nsaid to have achieved unitary status absent a finding by the lower\ncourt that the Board had \"eliminated the vestiges of its prior discrimi-\nnation,\" embodied in an \"adjudicat[ion] . . . through the proper judi-\ncial procedures.\" Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v.\nGeorgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460205\"><a href=\"/opinion/460205/georgia-state-conference-of-branches-of-naacp-mary-alice-covin-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1413 n.12 (11th Cir. 1985), quoted in\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (noting distinction between school systems\noperating in an unitary fashion and those that have achieved unitary\nstatus, and observing that the former \"could be called unitary and nev-\nertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination\").\n\n   Thirty-five years have passed since the Board first acted to equalize\nits facilities, yet serious questions remain as to whether it has finally\nrealized that goal. Dr. Dwayne E.

For the purposes of his study,\nDr. Gardner divided the subject schools into three groups: (1) all\nimbalanced-black schools; (2) all racially balanced schools in\nimbalanced-black census tracts; and (3) each remaining high school,\nalong with a set of elementary and middle schools randomly selected\n  13\n   The district court found that the expert called on behalf of the\nCapacchione plaintiffs, Dr. David J.

Schools scoring 44 or lower were, in\nDr. Gardner’s opinion, so deficient as to merit replacement, while\nthose with scores between 45-59 were classified as needing \"major\nimprovements.\" Any school that scored 60 or above was \"considered\nto have the ability to serve the educational program adequately.\" J.A.\n12174.\n\n   The results of Dr. Gardner’s study are troubling. The average score\nfor the forty Group 3 schools (racially balanced or imbalanced-white\nin predominantly white or balanced areas) was 61.7. Although the\nGroup 3 data indicate a situation that is far from ideal, the ten Group\n2 schools (racially balanced in predominantly black areas) fared much\nworse, with an average score of 56.3. The scores of the twenty-three\nGroup 1 schools (imbalanced-black) were worse still, averaging just\n53.3.14 At trial, Dr. Gardner confirmed that the disparities apparent\n  14\n     It has been famously said (by either Mark Twain or, earlier, Benja-\nmin Disraeli, depending on one’s source), \"There are three kinds of lies\n— lies, damned lies and statistics.\" A common difficulty in dealing with\nstatistics is illustrated by the district court’s analysis of Dr. Gardner’s\nstudy. The court first noted that, of the four schools scoring in the lowest\ncategory, two were in Group 1 and two were in Group 3.

We could accurately say, for example, that omission\nfrom Group 1 of the brand-new elementary school referred to by the dis-\ntrict court as having one of the highest ratings would lower the Group 1\naverage by more than a full point. Or we could state without error that\nseven of the twenty-three Group 1 schools (more than 30 percent) scored\nbelow 50, while only five of the forty Group 3 schools (12.5 percent)\nscored similarly. Indeed, we note that none of the Group 1 high schools\nscored higher than 46, yet all those in Groups 2 and 3 scored at 50 or\n\f132      BELK v.

J.A. 6196-99.\n\n   The anecdotal accounts of a number of witnesses effectively cor-\nroborated Dr. Gardner’s conclusions. See, e.g., J.A. 4992 (testimony\nof Board member Pamela R. Mange) (schools with \"more severe\"\nproblems tended to be predominantly black); J.A. 4769 (testimony of\nAnnelle Houk) (\"[T]he schools that were in the worst repair and had\nthe poorest supply of resources . . . were on the west side and they\nwere predominantly populated by black students.\"). John A. Kramer,\nco-chair of an advisory task force created by the Board, made formal\nvisits to several CMS schools in 1997. Among the locales on Mr.\nKramer’s itinerary were Elizabeth Lane Elementary, a predominantly\nwhite school located in a prosperous suburban area of the county, and\nShamrock Gardens Elementary, a downtown school with an African-\nAmerican student population exceeding sixty percent. Mr. Kramer’s\ndescriptions of his visits contrasted sharply:\n\n         [T]o compare Elizabeth Lane Elementary as an example,\n      which is a relatively new school located in Matthews, I\n      walked into that school, I was overwhelmed because I had\n      never set foot in a school that was like that before. It was\n      clean, it was light and airy, it was a beautiful facility. . . .\n      My overwhelming feeling was, wow, I wish my kids could\n      go to this school. And another observation that was very\n      clear was that when I looked at the student body, it was vir-\n\nabove. Of course, one would rightly view this latter declaration with\nsome skepticism once it became known that there are but fourteen high\nschools in CMS, only two of which were included by Dr. Gardner in\nGroup 1.\n   The pick-and-choose method gets us nowhere. The value of Dr. Gard-\nner’s research lies in the general conclusions that can be drawn from the\nentirety of the data. The most obvious conclusion is that, as a general\nmatter, imbalanced-black schools in CMS are in worse shape than those\nattended by larger proportions of white students. Once we accept that\npremise, the lone remaining question of any significance is \"Why?\"\n\f        BELK v.

I had never vis-\n     ited either one of these schools before, but to visit that\n     school which is in the inner city, the students are predomi-\n     nantly black students, it reminded me of a rundown 1950s\n     motel. There was literally no access to the rooms except by\n     outer walkways that were covered by rusted, dilapidated\n     overhead fixtures. . . . They were using closets and things\n     to teach children in. The carpets were stained and thread-\n     bare. . . . It just didn’t feel clean, it didn’t feel good. And\n     I can honestly say that as a parent, my heartfelt reaction was\n     relief that my children didn’t have to go to school there.\n\nJ.A. 6098-99. Even those Board members who voted to pursue a\ndetermination of unitary status before the district court admitted that\ndisparity in facilities was a problem within CMS. J.A. 1817, 1820\n(testimony of James H. Puckett); J.A. 1918-19 (testimony of John W.\nLassiter); J.A. 2095-96 (testimony of Lindalyn Kakadelis).\n\n   Although it seems reasonably clear that a racial disparity in facili-\nties exists in CMS, its cause is somewhat less apparent. The Capacch-\nione plaintiffs maintain that no discrepancies exist in CMS facilities,\nand even if they do, such discrepancies are totally benign in origin.\nHad the Capacchione plaintiffs proved their theory, we would be con-\nstrained to affirm the district court’s conclusion that unitary status has\nbeen achieved with respect to the facilities factor. The district court,\nhowever, required the Capacchione plaintiffs to prove nothing; it\ninstead erroneously placed the burden on CMS and the Swann plain-\ntiffs to affirmatively show that the present inequities in facilities are\na vestige of official discrimination, i.e., causally related to the prior\nde jure system of segregation.

In light of the court’s refusal to con-\nsider the Board’s proposed five-year Remedial Plan, it cannot be\ndetermined in the first instance whether practicable remedies to the cur-\nrent disparities exist.

Transportation\n\n   “School bus transportation was at the epicenter of the original\nSwann litigation, specifically the degree to which involuntary busing\ncould be used to implement a remedial desegregation decree. The\nSupreme Court in Swann, of course, approved busing as a \"normal\nand accepted tool of educational policy,\" 402 U.S. at 29, at least to\nthe extent that the rigors of time and distance would pose little risk\nto the affected students’ health or to the educational process as a\nwhole. See id. at 30-31. In the intervening twenty-nine years, CMS\nhas taken the Court’s license to heart; during the 1998-99 school year,\nfive of every six students in the school system rode a school bus.\n\n   Upon review of the Green factor of transportation, Judge Potter\nconcluded that \"a court may grant unitary status when transportation\nis provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 267. In\nother words, according to the district court, a school system achieves\nunitary status with respect to transportation once it provides access to\ntransportation non-discriminatorily to black and white children.\nBecause CMS provides all children, regardless of race, access to\ntransportation, Judge Potter concluded that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus with respect to this Green factor.\n\n  We must be mindful of the Supreme Court’s command to consider\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     137\nthe interrelatedness of the various Green factors. See Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 491 (court must consider \"whether retention of judicial control\nis necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in\nother facets of the school system\"). In this context, we can only con-\nclude that the Green factor of transportation is so inextricably inter-\ntwined with the Green factors of student assignment and facilities that\nvacatur on these latter issues would also mandate vacatur on the former.16\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs maintain and offer substantial record evidence\nthat the burdens of busing for desegregation purposes are being borne\ndisproportionately and unfairly by African-American children. Brief\nof Appellants at 31-32, 33-35; see Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1298 (dis-\ntrict court commenting in initial stages of remediation that it did not\nintend \"to endorse or approve any future plan which puts the burden\nof desegregation primarily upon one race\"). Eighty percent of stu-\ndents who currently ride the bus as a result of a mandatory assignment\nare African-American. Judge Potter rejected any consideration of this\n  16\n     Pursuant to Freeman, the district court accepted the invitation of the\nBoard and the Swann plaintiffs to consider whether vestiges of official\ndiscrimination remain concerning the ancillary factors of student\nachievement and student discipline. The court found in the negative, con-\ncluding that CMS had attained unitary status in both areas. We agree that\nthe district court’s judgment regarding student discipline should be\naffirmed.\n   With respect to the ancillary factor of student achievement, however,\nwe would vacate Judge Potter’s holding that unitary status had been\nachieved. Judge Potter found that disparities in student achievement\nexisted but that the disparities (1) were not vestiges of de jure segrega-\ntion and (2) could not be remedied by any practicable measure. Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 280-81. An analysis of disparities in student\nachievement may only be appropriate once the school system has\nachieved unitary status in other respects. See Swann, 306 F. Supp at 1309\n(\"Until unlawful segregation is eliminated, it is idle to speculate whether\nsome of this [achievement] gap can be charged to racial differences or\nto ‘socio-economic-cultural’ lag.\"). At the very least, student achieve-\nment in this case is inextricably intertwined with the other Green factors,\nparticularly student assignment. Therefore, for reasons akin to those dis-\ncussed in our analysis of the Green factor of transportation, we would\nlikewise conclude that the student achievement factor requires further\nconsideration.\n\f138     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\nevidence, holding that a school district has achieved unitary status\nwith respect to transportation as soon as it is provided on a race-\nneutral basis. The evidence, however, demonstrates the close interre-\nlationship of transportation with student assignment. In view of our\nconclusion that CMS is not yet unitary with regard to student assign-\nment, we think it is premature to relinquish control over transporta-\ntion at this stage.17\n\n                               4. Faculty\n\n   Our analysis of this factor must take two concerns into account. We\nmust determine both whether CMS has generally eliminated the ves-\ntiges of discrimination in faculty assignment, and whether the teach-\ners assigned to predominantly black schools are of comparable quality\nto those teaching in schools with large numbers of white students.18\nSee Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (final desegregation order directing\nthat the racial composition of faculty assigned to each school reflect\nthat of the system at large, with the proviso that \"the competence and\nexperience of teachers in formerly or recently black schools will not\nbe inferior to those in the formerly or recently white schools in the\nsystem\").\n  17\n      While the Remedial Plan does not specifically address transportation\nas a Green factor, it does propose siting new schools in a manner calcu-\nlated to promote racial balance in CMS. J.A. 11042. If CMS chooses\nsites for new schools that are more accessible to the majority of the black\npopulation, we presume that fewer black students would have to be\nbused to the suburbs for purposes of desegretation. A new approach to\nschool siting would address the vestiges of past discrimination, if such\nvestiges remain, in those areas in which CMS has not yet achieved uni-\ntary status.\n   18\n      The district court considered a particular school to be racially imbal-\nanced if its proportion of African-American students varied more than\nfifteen percent from the district-wide average. In 1998-99, African-\nAmericans represented 42.7% of the elementary students in CMS, 41.7%\nof the middle school students, and 39.6% of the high school students.\nJ.A. 11574. An elementary school would therefore be designated\nimbalanced-black if more than 57.7% of its students are African-\nAmerican; conversely, if African-Americans constituted less than 27.7%\nof the student body, the school would be designated imbalanced-white.\n\f           BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD           OF   EDUCATION        139\n   The evidence at trial demonstrated that CMS assigned its faculty\nin substantial compliance with the desegregation order at least until\n1992, when school principals were granted the leeway to actively\nrecruit new teachers without the strictures of maintaining a specific\nracial proportion. As a result of this gravitation from centralized to\nsite-based control of faculty assignments, a trend away from propor-\ntionality has emerged. In 1998-99, one-third of the 126 schools cov-\nered by the remedial decree had a proportion of black faculty\ndeviating more than ten percent from the system-wide norm (about\ntwenty-one percent). Prior to the 1992 change in policy, no more than\none-sixth of the schools had ever been so situated.\n\n   We are satisfied that the current trend toward faculty imbalance is\nneither a vestige of the dual system nor the product of subsequent dis-\ncrimination. There is no evidence that this trend results from legal or\nadministrative compulsion within CMS or from perceptions about the\ndesirability or undesirability of teaching positions in schools that\nserve students of predominantly one race. In short, we do not perceive\na causal relationship between past de jure segregation and the present\nassignment of faculty members to schools within CMS.19\n\n   Nor do we think that this trend toward more racially imbalanced\nfaculties has resulted in disparities in the quality of teaching, as mea-\nsured by the instructors’ years of experience and post-graduate work.\nIndeed, there is no significant difference in experience between facul-\nties at imbalanced-black schools as compared to those that are\nimbalanced-white. Faculties at black schools are about one year less\nexperienced than the district-wide average, while faculties at white\n  19\n     Even if the pattern of faculty assignments were somehow shown to\nbe a vestige of past official discrimination, the evidence before the dis-\ntrict court casts substantial doubt upon the Board’s ability to effect a\npracticable remedy.

[which] is especially pronounced with\n       regard to black teachers, particularly in this region of the coun-\n       try.\n\f140     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nschools are correspondingly more seasoned. This disparity may\narouse some initial concerns, until one is informed that the typical\nCMS teacher has spent more than ten years in the classroom. The\nupshot is that black and white students alike are, with no meaningful\ndistinction, enjoying the benefits of their teachers’ substantial experi-\nence.\n\n   The difference in post-graduate education between black-school\nand white-school faculties is more pronounced. For every three teach-\ners holding advanced degrees who ply their craft at imbalanced-white\nschools, there are only two similarly qualified teachers assigned to\nschools that are imbalanced-black. Compared to the district average,\nwhite schools have a somewhat larger proportion of these highly\ntrained instructors, while the allotment granted to black schools is\nslightly less than the norm.\n\n   Although these facts give us reason for concern, we think it impru-\ndent to disturb the district court’s conclusion that the trial evidence\naffirmatively disclosed no link between past discrimination and the\ncurrent asymmetry. Most revealing on this point is that, until now, the\nissue of teacher quality within CMS has not been contested. The 1970\ndesegregation order mandating equal competence and experience in\nfaculty assignments was not meant to remedy disparities then exist-\ning, but was instead intended to caution against future imbalances. In\nthe intervening thirty years, there is little indication that CMS has\nneglected to heed the warning inherent in that order. We therefore\nagree that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the\ndeveloping disparities in teacher assignments and any (perhaps super-\nficial) deficiency in the quality of instruction currently afforded\nAfrican-American children are unrelated to the de jure segregation\nonce prevalent in the school system.20\n\n  20\n    Although the Board’s official position, as outlined in its Remedial\nPlan, is that remediable vestiges of de jure segregation do remain as to\nfaculty assignments and quality, the clear weight of the evidence is to the\ncontrary. The district court’s failure to consider the Plan was therefore\nharmless in this narrow respect.\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    141\n                               5. Staff\n\n   In substantially the same manner as it spoke to the allocation of\nteachers, the final desegregation order provided that \"the internal\noperation of each school, and the assignment and management of\nschool employees, of course be conducted on a non-racial, non-\ndiscriminatory basis.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 269. Inasmuch as the\nSwann plaintiffs raised no challenge to the school system’s compli-\nance with the desegregation order in this regard, the court below\nfound CMS to have achieved unitary status with regard to its support\nstaff. We agree that this aspect of the district court’s judgment should\nbe affirmed.\n\n                    6. Extracurricular activities\n\n   According to the evidence at trial, African-American students in\nCMS participate in athletics and hold class office at a rate proportion-\nate to their numbers. These same students lag far behind, however,\nwhen it comes to participating in co-curricular clubs and honors pro-\ngrams. J.A. 11634. However, the scope of our inquiry concerning\nextracurricular activities is limited. We need only determine whether\nthe school system permits its students equal access to extracurricular\nactivities, without regard to race.

Par-\nticipation in honors programs and co-curricular clubs is strictly volun-\ntary, and there is no evidence that the lack of participation by African-\nAmerican students in certain activities reflects the efforts of CMS to\nexclude them.

We conclude that it does not.21\nSee also Wilkinson Op. at 72-75.\n\n   At the outset, we note that it is undisputed that this expanded mag-\nnet schools program differs in critical respects from all race-based\nstudent assignment plans that have been held to be in conflict with the\nEqual Protection Clause. Unlike school districts found to have vio-\nlated the Constitution, CMS adopted the challenged program while\noperating a dual, segregated school system, under a myriad of court\norders commanding the Board to eliminate the unlawful segregation.\n\n    The court orders — the public record attests to their numerosity\nand demands — require CMS to use its expertise and best efforts to\ndesegregate its schools promptly. The federal court repeatedly\ndirected the school board to employ its \"full ‘know-how’ and\nresources\" to use \"any means at [its] disposal\" to do away with the\nunconstitutionally segregated school system.

This is\nbecause even if Judge Potter did not err in decreeing that CMS has\nnow achieved unitary status (and we believe he did), prior to his deci-\nsion, no court had ever determined that CMS had attained unitary sta-\ntus. As the Capacchione plaintiffs concede, Judge Potter’s decision\n— not some earlier event — \"terminated [the] injunction\" issued by\nJudge McMillan and affirmed by the Supreme Court. Brief of Appel-\nlees at 3.\n\n   Judge Potter properly acknowledged both the governing court\norders and the fact that the remedial measures CMS took pursuant to\nthem, including expansion of its magnet schools program, could not\nbe analyzed as if taken by a \"de facto\" unitary school district. See\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 285 (\"The Court finds no legal basis\nfor a finding of de facto unitary status that would abrogate CMS’s\nimmunity retroactively. In other words, the termination of court\nsupervision cannot ‘relate back’ to an earlier time.\"). Yet, notwith-\nstanding CMS’s undisputed status as a dual school district under mul-\ntiple court orders to desegregate its schools, the judge held that the\nBoard’s adoption of the expanded magnet schools program violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause. Furthermore, he found this constitutional\nviolation rendered CMS liable to the Capacchione plaintiffs for dam-\nages and enormous attorney’s fees.\n\n   The Capacchione plaintiffs seek to uphold that ruling on several\ngrounds. First and principally, they contend that the Board’s increased\nreliance on magnet schools constituted a \"voluntary desegregation\nplan implemented to counteract demographic change,\" rather than a\ngood faith effort to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination as\nrequired by the court orders governing this case. Second, they argue\n\f144    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nthat the expanded program’s race-conscious assignment policy vio-\nlated the existing desegregation orders. Finally, they maintain that,\neven if CMS expanded its magnet schools program pursuant to and\nin compliance with governing court orders, strict scrutiny nonetheless\napplies and requires that the program be held unconstitutional. The\ndistrict court properly rejected the first and third arguments, and the\ndissent does not seek to resurrect them. Accordingly, although we\naddress all of these contentions, we initially examine the second, the\nonly one on which the district court, or the dissent, relies.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   In concluding that the expanded magnet schools program violated\nthe Constitution, the district court committed two fatal errors. Ini-\ntially, it ignored the extent of the protection afforded an entity gov-\nerned by federal court orders. Then, the district court refused to\nrecognize the broad directives and expansive terms of the controlling\ncourt orders, and so failed to appreciate that the Board expanded its\nmagnet schools program in good faith to comply with these orders,\nand thus cannot be held to have violated the Constitution. The dissent\nreplicates both errors.\n\n                                   1.\n\n   Judge Potter, like the dissent, does pay lip service to the \"immu-\nnity\" the Board enjoyed because it was subject to numerous judicial\ndesegregation decrees, see, e.g., Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 285\n(\"CMS enjoys immunity from liability for any actions it took consis-\ntent with the Court’s injunction.\"); Traxler Op. at 46. But the district\ncourt and the dissent apparently do not understand what the numerous\ncourt orders in this case required of CMS and the breadth of the pro-\ntection those orders afforded to it. Thus, both Judge Potter and the\ndissent mention the subject only in passing, failing even to cite con-\ntrolling Supreme Court cases on point. See id.\n\n   A person or entity subject to a judicial decree or injunction (as\nCMS indisputably was when operating its dual, segregated school\nsystem) must comply with that decree or injunction, notwithstanding\nits possible unlawfulness. Thus, the Supreme Court has clearly and\nunequivocally directed that \"persons subject to an injunctive order\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    145\nissued by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that decree\nuntil it is modified or reversed, even if they have proper grounds to\nobject to the order.\" GTE Sylvania, Inc. v.

Grace, 461 U.S. at 766, arise if a court lacks jurisdiction over\nthe subject matter of the order or the order has \"‘only a frivolous pre-\ntense to validity.’\" GTE, 445 U.S. at 386 (quoting Walker v. City of\nBirmingham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107489\"><a href=\"/opinion/107489/walker-v-birmingham/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (1967)). Without question, the fed-\neral court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the desegregation\norders issued in this case and no one suggests that those orders consti-\ntuted \"only a frivolous pretense to validity.\"\n\n   Accordingly, CMS had to obey those orders. This is so notwith-\nstanding that those orders may have required the Board to forego\ncompeting obligations, see W.R. Grace, 461 U.S. at 767-68, including\nobligations seemingly required by a federal statute, see GTE, 445 U.S.\nat 378 & n.2, 386-87, or the Constitution itself, see Walker, 388 U.S.\nat 317. Indeed, the Supreme Court has explained that to hold that an\nentity acts \"improperly\" in obeying a valid court order \"would do vio-\nlence to the common understanding of the term ‘improperly,’\" even\nif the order is later held unlawful or unconstitutional. GTE, 445 U.S.\nat 387. Moreover, a court order need not mandate specific or precise\nprocedures to compel obedience. Thus, although the Court noted the\n\"breadth and vagueness\" of the injunction challenged in Walker, it\nnonetheless held that the injunction had to be obeyed until \"modified\nor dissolved.\" Walker, 388 U.S. at 317.\n\n   \"Violations of [a court] order are punishable as criminal contempt\neven though the order is set aside on appeal.\" United States v.

Thus, in words that resound\nhere, the Supreme Court has explained that \"a school board and a\nschool constituency which attempt to comply with a [court-ordered\n\f146    BELK v.

In Spangler, the Court concluded that the\ndistrict court exceeded its remedial discretion when it ordered the Pas-\nadena school district to reconfigure its student attendance zones annu-\nally so that there would be \"no majority of any minority\" in any\nschool. 427 U.S. at 434-35. Despite the impropriety of this order, the\nCourt held that the school board had to obey the order until it was\nproperly modified or reversed by a court. See id. at 439-40 (\"[T]hose\nwho are subject to the commands of an injunctive order must obey\nthose commands, notwithstanding eminently reasonable and proper\nobjections to the order, until it is modified or reversed.\").\n\n   Similarly, in Dowell, the Court refused to interpret an arguably\nambiguous court order as having terminated the desegregation decree\npreviously entered against the Oklahoma City school board. Instead,\nthe Court remanded the case to the district court for a determination\nof \"whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitutional\ncompliance . . . to allow the injunction to be dissolved.\" Dowell, 498\nU.S. at 249. In doing so, the Court explained that judicial orders carry\nbinding authority until they are modified or dissolved.\n\n   Moreover, the Dowell Court rejected precisely the kind of argu-\nment the Capacchione plaintiffs seek to make here. In Dowell, as\nhere, those challenging the school board’s actions argued (and the\ncourt of appeals found) that the school board \"unilaterally and con-\ntrary to specific provisions\" of the controlling court orders \"acted in\na manner not contemplated by the court in its earlier decrees.\" Dowell\nby Dowell v.

The Supreme Court acknowledged that this might well be so,\nbut concluded that nonetheless it did \"not think that the Board should\nbe penalized for relying on the express language of that order.\"\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249 n.1. Similarly, even if CMS had \"acted in a\nmanner not contemplated\" in the governing orders — and clearly it\ndid not, see infra, at part III.A.2 — it should not \"be penalized for\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION    147\nrelying on the express language\" of those orders, Dowell, 498 U.S. at\n249 n.1, i.e., \"to use [its] full ‘know-how’ and resources . . . to\nachieve the constitutional end [i.e., desegregation of the schools] by\nany means at [its] disposal.\" Swann, 318 F. Supp. at 802.\n\n   Of course, the Capacchione plaintiffs could have sought to modify\nor dissolve the Swann orders as inconsistent with their rights under\nthe Constitution; what they could not do is obtain an injunction, or\ndeclaration, that a party compelled to adhere to those orders violated\nthe Constitution in so doing. CMS was obliged to follow the govern-\ning desegregation orders and injunctions, and thus the Board \"should\nnot be penalized,\" Brinkman, 433 U.S. at 421, for its actions, which\nwere taken to comply with those orders and which the district court\nfound, and the dissent does not dispute, were taken in good faith. See\nTraxler Op. at 41.\n\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the desegregation orders\nin this case and the Board’s actions in response to those orders.\n\n                                  2.\n\n   Throughout the course of the desegregation efforts in this case, the\nfederal courts — from the district level to the Supreme Court — have\ntold the Board that it has the authority to take \"whatever steps might\nbe necessary to convert to a unitary system.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 15;\nsee also Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360 (\"The Board is free to consider\nall known ways of desegregation.\") (emphasis added). Thus, CMS has\ncontinually acted under judicial directives that \"[t]he choice of how\nto do the job of desegregation is for the School Board — not for the\ncourt.\" Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1297. See also Wilkinson Op. at 72-\n74.\n\n   Even beyond CMS’s broad discretion to choose its own methods\nof eliminating its unconstitutionally segregated schools, Judge\nMcMillan’s orders repeatedly endorsed the Board’s general power\nand duty to maintain control over the racial composition of the\nschools in order to eliminate the vestiges of the segregated system\n\"root and branch.\" For instance, in 1970 Judge McMillan mandated:\n\f148      BELK v.

To do this as an\n      educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers\n      of school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional\n      violation, however, that would not be within the authority of\n      a federal court.\n\f         BELK v.

CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION\nmagnet schools, which it called \"optional schools.\" These schools\noffered two special curricula — \"open\" and \"traditional\" — both of\nwhich constituted \"very rigorous academic program[s]\" not offered in\n\"conventional schools.\" J.A. 2489, 15683. In 1992, the Board\nexpanded its magnet schools program into a district-wide system with\na wider range of curricular choices. In the expanded magnet schools\nprogram, the Board retained the curricula first available in the early\nmagnet or \"optional\" schools — the \"open\" curriculum emphasizing\n\"interdisciplinary approaches,\" and the \"traditional\" curriculum fea-\nturing a \"highly structured program.\" J.A. 16722-23. Furthermore, six\nof the early magnet schools that offered such curricula prior to 1992\n— Myers Park, Elizabeth, Hawthorne, Irwin Avenue, Piedmont, and\nWest Charlotte — continue to do so today under the expanded magnet\nschools program. Compare J.A. 13448, 13529-40, 15683 (pre-1992\n\"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets) with J.A. 16722-23 (1998-99\n\"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets); see also J.A. 10061 (report indicat-\ning that pre-1992 magnet schools were incorporated into the 1992\nexpanded magnet schools program).23\n  23\n     Judge Potter recognized that the optional schools \"were similar to\ntoday’s magnet schools,\" both having \"countywide enrollment and a\nracial balancing target.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

To the contrary, assuming arguendo\nthat \"specialized curricula\" constitute a \"benefit,\" the magnet schools\ninstituted after 1992 provide precisely the same \"benefit\" as the pre-1992\n\"optional schools.\" See J.A. 10552 (proposed 1992 pupil assignment plan\nrecommending continuation of six magnet schools already in place); J.A.\n15504 (1993 letter noting that magnet schools were called \"optional\nschools\" prior to 1992); J.A. 10651 (Summary of Findings From\nResearch on Magnet Schools explaining that \"[o]ur optional schools\nfunction as magnet schools\"); J.A. 13606, 15581 (Stolee Plan explaining\nthat \"[t]he traditional schools presently existing in Charlotte-\nMecklenburg are good examples\" of curriculum specialty schools,\n\"sometimes called magnet schools\"). After all, it was only because the\noptional schools did offer certain \"specialized curricula\" that parents\n(including Michael Grant, one of the Capacchione plaintiffs, J.A. 2489)\nwere willing, well prior to the 1992 expanded magnet schools program,\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION     151\n   The expanded magnet schools program is a typical and appropriate\ndesegregation tool \"conceived and developed in large, urban school\ndistricts seeking a voluntary alternative to busing as a means of\ndecreasing racial segregation.\" J.A. 10654.

But they\nnonetheless suggest that the expanded magnet schools program, in\nand of itself, may violate the Constitution. See id. at 71-74.

The dissent’s sug-\ngestion that CMS somehow violated the Constitution by expanding its\nmagnet schools program and \"abandon[ing] pairings, satellites, and\nfeeders,\" Traxler Op. at 50, seems particularly extraordinary. Magnet\nschools are generally regarded as being a less onerous and more suc-\ncessful desegregation tool than pairing, satellites, or feeders because\nmagnet schools provide more opportunity for student choice. See,\ne.g., Stell, 888 F.2d at 85; Yonkers, 837 F.2d at 1239.\n\n   Of course, as Judge McMillan warned, in approving the early mag-\nnet or optional schools, assignment of pupils to such schools must be\nundertaken in a manner that \"provide[s] . . . access to appropriately\nintegrated optional schools,\" and \"prevent[s] significant jeopardy to\nthe racial composition of other schools.\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103.24\n\nto enroll their children in desegregated optional schools. See J.A. 13641,\n15616. In fact, the original six \"open\" and \"traditional\" schools remain\namong CMS’s more heavily subscribed magnets. See J.A. 10292-340.\nMyers Park Traditional, for example, had 245 students on its waiting list\nfor the 1998-99 school year. See J.A. 2159.\n   24\n      The dissent’s contention that Judge McMillan \"cautio[ned]\" CMS\nagainst creating optional schools because the schools were marked by\n\"failure\" flies in the face of the court orders. Traxler Op. at 49. In fact,\nthe only warnings that Judge McMillan gave regarding optional schools\n\f152     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nFor this reason, race is, and must be, considered in assigning students\nto the magnet schools instituted under CMS’s expanded program, just\nas it was in assigning students to the original magnet or optional\nschools. See 379 F. Supp. at 1108. Specifically, under the expanded\nprogram, CMS allocates 40% of the seats in its magnet schools for\nblack students and 60% for students of other races. This ratio reflects\nthe student population of the school system, which is approximately\n41.0% black, 52.2% white, 3.7% Asian, 2.5% Hispanic, and .5%\nAmerican Indian. CMS generally assigns students to its magnet\nschools using two parallel lotteries, one for black students and one for\nwhite students. When there has been insufficient interest from black\nstudents to fill the seats allocated to them in a particular school, CMS\nhas sometimes refused to allow students of other races to fill those\nslots. Thus, race may affect a student’s chances of being assigned to\na magnet school.\n\n   It is this portion of the expanded magnet schools program that\nJudge Potter regarded as unconstitutional, reasoning that Judge\nMcMillan \"firmly rejected the use of rigid racial quotas.\" Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 286 (relying on Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1312).\nIn reaching this conclusion, Judge Potter misread the order on which\nhe assertedly relied and ignored the multiple other orders and injunc-\ntions governing this case.\n\nwere against repeating the past \"failure\" to provide adequate transporta-\ntion and against failing to provide \"adequate safeguards against discrimi-\nnatory results,\" so as to prevent optional schools from \"resurrect[ing]\"\n\"freedom of choice\" plans under a new name. Swann, 379 F. Supp. at\n1103-04.\n   Moreover, the dissent’s heavy emphasis on Dr. Stolee’s recommenda-\ntion to the Board that it seek court approval of the expanded magnet\nschools program is puzzling. That one advisor should suggest this does\nnot change the facts, and the critical facts here are that the expanded\nmagnet schools program was simply an expansion of the court-appointed\noptional schools. Even if this were not so, the Board’s decision to ignore\na recommendation from one educational adviser (not a lawyer) on a legal\nmatter certainly does not evidence the Board’s bad faith or render its\naction violative of any court order.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD       OF   EDUCATION   153\n   Actually, in the very paragraph on which Judge Potter relied, in\nwhich Judge McMillan held that \"[f]ixed ratios of pupils in particular\nschools will not be set\" by the court, Judge McMillan also held that\n\"efforts should be made [by the school board] to reach a 71-29 ratio\nin the various schools so that there will be no basis for contending\nthat one school is racially different from the others.\" Swann, 306 F.\nSupp. at 1312 (emphasis added). Judge Potter transmuted this state-\nment — an authorization for the Board to make \"efforts\" to \"reach a\n71-29 ratio\" — into a prohibition against the Board assigning students\nto schools on the basis of that fixed ratio. See Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 286. We cannot accept this reading of Judge McMillan’s\norder. Taken as a whole, this paragraph provides some of the clearest\nevidence that Judge McMillan not only authorized the Board to use\nfixed ratios in assigning students to schools but encouraged it to do\nso. Recognizing the impracticability of adopting a court-ordered,\nsystem-wide racial balance to which all schools must adhere, Judge\nMcMillan did observe that \"variations from that [71-29 ratio] may be\nunavoidable.\" Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1312. But that statement\nimposes no limitations on the scope of permissible Board action.\nRather, it suggests that \"variations\" were acceptable only because\nthey were \"unavoidable.\"\n\n   The Board could not have accomplished what the desegregation\norders required without \"using race\" in the way that it \"used race\" in\nthe context of the expanded magnet schools program. In the 1970\norder, affirmed by the Supreme Court, Judge McMillan decreed\n\"[t]hat pupils of all grades be assigned in such a way that as nearly\nas practicable the various schools at various grade levels have about\nthe same proportion of black and white students.\" Swann, 311 F.\nSupp. at 268. We cannot fathom how the Board could set out to\nachieve \"about the same proportion of black and white students\" in\neach grade level in each of its over one hundred schools without\nemploying fixed racial ratios as the central components of its student\nassignment plan. Neither, apparently, could Judge McMillan.\n\n   To achieve \"about the same proportion,\" the Board necessarily had\nto set fixed upper and lower limits on the proportion of white and\nblack students it would permit in each grade in each school. Only\nwith these fixed racial proportions as its lodestars could the Board\nassign students to schools, and approve or deny individual requests to\n\f154     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\ntransfer. The Board could never have justified a denial of a transfer\nrequest without having a fixed conception of exactly how few white\nor black students in a particular school would be too few.\n\n   Indeed, Judge McMillan expressly approved many aspects of the\nCMS desegregation plan that were explicitly based on strict racial\nratios. For example, the Board’s majority-to-minority transfer policy,\nwhich was specifically authorized by the governing desegregation\norders, takes race into account in much the same way as the magnet\nschools assignment policy. Under the transfer policy, a student in the\nracial majority in his current school could freely transfer to a school\nin which he would be in the racial minority. A white student in a\nmajority white school, for example, could freely transfer to a majority\nblack school, but that same student could be denied admission to a\nmajority white school, solely on the basis of a rigid 50% racial ceil-\ning. Meanwhile, a black student at a majority black school could\nfreely transfer into the same majority white school to which the white\nstudent might be denied admission. The Supreme Court approved this\nuse of majority-to-minority transfer policies as \"a useful part of every\ndesegregation plan\" and \"an indispensable remedy.\" Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 26. In fact, Judge McMillan specifically upheld this majority-to-\nminority plan, despite former CMS Superintendent Dr. J. M. Robin-\nson’s complaints about the rigidity of the 50% limit. See Martin, 475\nF. Supp. at 1343 (\"I would like to have had more flexibility than the\n50 percent in some instances, but I would be opposed to recommend-\ning any plan that went, any of the schools going over more than a few\npercentage points above 50 percent.\").\n\n   It is certainly true that Judge McMillan’s orders and the Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in Swann consistently signaled concern with the\nimposition of racial proportions or ratios by federal courts. That con-\ncern, however, is rooted in the problem of federal courts exceeding\ntheir remedial discretion, not in any objection to the use of racial pro-\nportions or ratios by school boards themselves in their desegregation\nplans. Thus, the Supreme Court noted that, \"[t]he constitutional com-\nmand to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every\ncommunity must always reflect the racial composition of the school\nsystem as a whole,\" but went on to conclude that \"the very limited use\nmade of mathematical ratios was within the equitable remedial discre-\ntion of the District Court.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24-25.\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION     155\n   That this concern with ratios is rooted in the limits of judicial\npower to order remedial action, not in the impropriety of using racial\nproportions to remedy the vestiges of segregation, is nowhere more\napparent than in Chief Justice Burger’s statement in Swann. There,\nthe Chief Justice noted that while in certain circumstances it might be\ninappropriate for a federal court to require adherence to \"a prescribed\nratio of Negro to white students reflecting\" the population of the \"dis-\ntrict as a whole,\" it would be \"within the broad discretionary powers\nof school authorities\" to do so. Id. at 16. See also Wilkinson Op. at\n73.\n\n   Indeed, in Swann’s companion case, North Carolina State Bd. of\nEduc. v. Swann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108319\"><a href=\"/opinion/108319/north-carolina-bd-of-ed-v-swann/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45-46 (1971), the Supreme Court held\nthat any attempt to \"inhibit or obstruct\" the Board’s use of racial\nratios \"must fall.\" The Court explained that, \"when past and continu-\ning constitutional violations are found [as they had been in the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg school system], some ratios are likely to be\nuseful starting points in shaping a remedy. An absolute prohibition\nagainst use of such a device . . . contravenes the implicit command\nof Green.\" Id. at 46. The Court expressly recognized that a \"flat pro-\nhibition against assignment of students for the purpose of creating\nracial balance must inevitably conflict with the duty of school authori-\nties to disestablish dual school systems.\" Id. (emphasis added).\n\n   The Board’s authority to employ racial ratios is explicit not only\nin the Supreme Court’s opinions, but also in Judge McMillan’s\nrepeated statements to the effect that \"[i]ndependent of any court\norder . . . if this Board of Education chose to run an integrated school\nsystem on the basis of preconceived ratios, it has that constitutional\nright.\" Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1342 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In fact, early in the litigation Judge McMillan held that:\n\n    Counsel for the plaintiffs says that since the ratio of white\n    to black students is about 70/30, the School Board should\n    assign the children on a basis 70% white and 30% black,\n    and bus them to all the schools. This court does not feel that\n    it has the power to make such a specific order. Nevertheless,\n    the Board does have the power to establish a formula and\n    provide transportation.\n\f156     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nSwann, 300 F. Supp. at 1371 (emphasis added).\n\n   Moreover, this Court upheld \"the validity of the Board’s decision\nto reassign students in order to maintain racial ratios,\" and stated that\nthe \"School Board is vested with broad discretionary powers over\neducational policy and is well within its powers when it decides that\nas a matter of policy schools should not have a majority [over 50%]\nof minority students.\" Martin, 626 F.2d at 1167. Having been repeat-\nedly told by federal courts that it had the \"constitutional right\" to\n\"maintain racial ratios\" to remedy past segregation, CMS cannot now\nbe held to have violated the Constitution for doing exactly what the\ncourts have said it had the power to do.\n\n   In short, time and again, the federal courts at all levels have autho-\nrized the Board to employ racial ratios to remedy its unlawfully segre-\ngated school system. Although the dissent repeatedly contends to the\ncontrary, Traxler Op. at 52, 54, 55, no court has ever prohibited CMS\n(rather than the federal court supervising it) from imposing \"racial\nratios.\" The dissent’s contention that Judge McMillan’s order — man-\ndating a black student population \"about or above 20%\" in the\noptional schools, instead of the Board’s proposed \"at or above\napproximately 20%\" language — constitutes a rejection of \"rigid\nracial quotas,\" Traxler Op. at 53, is singularly unconvincing. It seems\nunlikely that by this slight word difference Judge McMillan even indi-\ncated a disapproval of the Board’s use of \"rigid\" quotas, which would\notherwise have been permitted under the Board’s policy. It seems far\nmore likely that Judge McMillan believed that his order permitting a\nracial ratio \"about or above 20%\" was equivalent to the Board’s pol-\nicy of permitting a racial ratio \"at or above approximately 20%.\" In\nany event, neither linguistic formulation prohibits the Board from\nadopting an 80-20 ratio for the early optional schools, or the 60-40\nratio for magnet schools that it subsequently adopted in 1992, espe-\ncially in light of the Board’s broad discretion and explicit authoriza-\ntion to use strict racial ratios in other areas of its desegregation plan.\n\n   Similarly, the dissent’s suggestion that the expanded magnet\nschools program differs from the \"optional schools\" program because\nthe Board set \"inflexible quotas\" in the expanded plan, Traxler Op. at\n44, is simply not borne out by the record. In truth, in 1992, CMS\nimplemented a 60-40 white-black ratio with an eye to reaching a\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     157\nracial balance that corresponded with the make-up of the entire stu-\ndent population of the school system, just as in 1974 it implemented\nthe 80-20 white-black ratio to correspond with the entire student pop-\nulation at that time. The 60-40 ratio was not applied in any more of\na rigid or \"inflexible\" manner than the earlier ratio; Board policy pro-\nvided that \"all magnet schools would maintain a 60-40 white-black\nratio plus or minus 15%,\" J.A. 13705; see also J.A. 3187, 3193, and\nthe Student Assignment Plan permitted \"racial balance [to] be allowed\nto fluctuate.\" J.A. 15702. The Board’s Executive Director of Planning\nand Student Placement testified that several race-neutral consider-\nations, such as sibling attendance, would allow a school to \"depart\nfrom the 60-40 goal.\" J.A. 3217; see also J.A. 3091-92, 3193-94.\nContrary to the dissent’s claims of rigidity, not a single magnet school\nactually manifested a 60-40 ratio. J.A. 3185. A number of magnet\nschools came close to the stated goal, but the percentage of black stu-\ndents in CMS’s magnet schools ranged from 7% to 82%, id., and stu-\ndents that failed to gain admission to one magnet school \"often ha[d]\na seat waiting for them at another magnet school of their choosing.\"\nJ.A. 3076. In fact, the two \"black seats\" about which Christina Capac-\nchione originally complained were ultimately filled by two white stu-\ndents, despite the supposedly \"inflexible\" ratio. In sum, the 60-40\nratio was not an unbendable \"quota,\" either in policy or in practice,\nany more than the earlier ratio had been.\n\n   Both the Supreme Court and Judge McMillan provided CMS with\n\"wide discretion\" to fashion appropriate remedies in light of the par-\nticular needs of its pupils and the school system’s experience with\nother desegregation tools. Additionally, Judge McMillan approved\nspecific race-conscious assignment measures generally and specifi-\ncally as to magnet schools.25 Thus, when adopting a 60-40 assignment\n  25\n    The dissent, see Traxler Op. at 50, makes much of Judge McMillan’s\n1970 instruction that \"leave of the court be obtained before making any\nmaterial departure from any specific requirement set out herein,\" Swann,\n311 F. Supp. at 270. But the dissent fails to acknowledge that this state-\nment followed Judge McMillan’s declaration that the Board had \"maxi-\nmum discretion . . . to choose methods that will accomplish the required\nresult.\" Id. The \"material departure\" provision was not an attempt to limit\nthe Board’s ability to choose its own methods to move aggressively for-\nward with the desegregation of its schools, but rather was a message that\n\f158     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD          OF   EDUCATION\nformula in the expanded magnet schools program, the Board not only\nacted within its \"wide discretion,\" but also in accordance with specific\nprocedures approved by the district court.\n\n   Judge Potter’s conclusion (and the dissent’s contention) to the con-\ntrary simply cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court opinion in\nSwann, our opinions in this case, and Judge McMillan’s decrees. The\nmagnet schools’ race-conscious assignment policy constitutes a nec-\nessary safeguard against the risk that unchecked transfers to magnet\nschools could increase the number of racially identifiable schools in\nviolation of the Board’s continuing obligation under the desegregation\norders. See 379 F. Supp. at 1105 (\"Racially identifiable schools may\nnot be operated.\"). In that vein, the Capacchione plaintiffs’ own\nexpert on school desegregation, Dr. David Armor, agreed that racial\nquotas are permissible in a desegregation plan. J.A. 3627. Dr. Armor\ntestified that \"race is an integral part of pairing, of satelliting, of mag-\nnet schools, of running lotteries for magnet schools. The entire plan\nis predicated on race and race controls, because that’s the only way\nyou can meet the court order and to have an effective plan is to\nemploy race requirements and racial quotas basically for all schools.\"\nJ.A. 3434.\n\n   In sum, contrary to Judge Potter’s conclusion, Judge McMillan\nspecifically authorized the use of fixed ratios based on race in assign-\ning students to magnet schools. See 379 F. Supp. at 1104. Further-\nmore, even without such specific authorization, the broad discretion\ngranted the Board by the Supreme Court’s opinion in Swann and by\nthe other court orders and injunctions governing this case permitted\nCMS to fashion magnet schools with racially balanced enrollments.\nThe decrees make plain that ratios based on race were among the\n\"means\" by which the Board was authorized \"to achieve the constitu-\ntional end\" of desegregation. Swann 311 F. Supp. at 268-69; see also\nSwann, 362 F. Supp. at 1225; Swann, 334 F. Supp. at 631. As such,\n\nthis previously recalcitrant school district should not use its \"discretion\"\nto take steps backward, i.e., a \"material departure,\" from its obligation to\nachieve the court-ordered \"goal\" of \"complete desegregation of the entire\nsystem to the maximum extent possible.\" Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1298-\n99.\n\f        BELK v.

We\ncannot agree.26\n\n    First, Judge Potter \"accept[ed] that the school system was acting to\n. . . remedy[ ] the effects of past racial discrimination\" in expanding\nthe number of magnet schools in 1992.

Ample record evidence supports this finding. See, e.g., J.A.\n2716 (testimony of John Murphy, former CMS Superintendent, that\n1992 plan to expand the magnet school program was among the \"cre-\native strategies we could come up with to stay in compliance with the\ncourt order\"); J.A. 3869-74 (testimony of Jeff Schiller, former assis-\ntant superintendent for research, assessment, and planning for CMS,\nexplaining that the 1992 student assignment plan, including the\nexpanded magnet schools program, \"had the same objectives as the\none that it was going to replace, maintaining the court order,\" and that\nthe objective of the expanded magnet program specifically was \"to\nmaintain the integration of schools through voluntary means\"); J.A.\n15503-05 (1993 letter from CMS to the U.S. Department of Education\ndiscussing Judge McMillan’s 1974 order and identifying the creation\nof additional magnet schools as among the \"more effective ways . . .\n[to] meet[ ] the guidelines established by the Court\"); J.A. 13607,\n15582 (Stolee Plan recommendation that \"[the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg school desegregation plan should be gradually changed\nfrom a mandatory plan with little voluntarism to a voluntary plan with\nfew mandatory facets\").\n\n  Furthermore, the dichotomy the Capacchione plaintiffs suggest\nbetween \"counter[ing] demographic change,\" on the one hand, and\nremedying past discrimination, on the other, oversimplifies both the\nlaw of school desegregation, particularly the Supreme Court’s deci-\n  26\n    Tellingly, the dissent does not even mention this argument.\n\f160     BELK v.

Indeed, remedies such as school busing and satellite\nattendance zones would never have been necessary in the first place\nif the demography of the community were not an obstacle to desegre-\ngation. In a sense, Swann’s basic teaching is that the Constitution\nsometimes requires schools to \"counter demograph[y]\" in order to\nachieve desegregation. The Swann Court noted that the process of\n\"local authorities . . . meet[ing] their constitutional obligations\" had\n\"been rendered more difficult by changes . . . in the structure and pat-\nterns of communities, the growth of student population, [and] move-\nment of families.\" 402 U.S. at 14. The Court expressed concern that\n\"segregated residential patterns . . . [would] lock the school system\ninto the mold of separation of the races.\" Id. at 21. Thus, CMS simply\nfollowed the Supreme Court’s guidance in Swann in regarding change\nas a problem inhibiting its progress toward unitary status.27\n  27\n     The Capacchione plaintiffs contend that, given the obvious concern\nof school officials with demographic changes, \"CMS could not have\nbeen motivated by any desire to comply with its court-ordered duty to\neradicate vestiges of segregation.\" Brief of Appellees at 85. But this\nstands the analysis on its head. A court determines from the effect of their\nacts, not from their motives, whether school authorities comply with a\ndesegregation decree. See Wright v. Council of Emporia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108587\"><a href=\"/opinion/108587/wright-v-council-of-emporia/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n462 (1972) (\"It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the\nsole or dominant motivation behind choices of a group of legislators, and\nthe same may be said of the choices of a school board. . . .

Moreover,\neven if motivation were relevant, the argument would fail. A fair reading\nof the record demonstrates that although school officials were obviously\naware of the demographic shifts, they viewed these shifts as an obstacle\nto achieving compliance with the Swann orders and to eliminating the\nvestiges of discrimination in the school system, not as the condition that\nitself necessitated a remedy. See, e.g., J.A. 13597-98, 15572-73 (Stolee\nPlan identifying \"a growing and moving population\" as one of several\nfactors creating instability in student assignment under the pre-1992 sys-\ntem of pairing and satelliting); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter from CMS to the\nU.S. Department of Education listing \"demographic and residential pat-\n\f        BELK v.

Nor\ndoes Freeman bar courts from targeting racial isolation resulting in\nsignificant part from \"private choice,\" if that isolation is also a vestige\nof past discrimination. The effect of such a holding in Freeman would\nhave been to overrule Green, which the Supreme Court did not pur-\nport to do. In Green, even though the school board allowed every stu-\ndent \"freedom of choice\" as to which school to attend, the formerly\nblack school remained all black and the formerly white school\nremained predominantly white — wholly as a result, in some sense,\nof this \"private choice.\" The Green Court held that, although the pri-\nvate choices of students and their families were responsible for the\ncontinuing racial isolation of the schools’ student populations, that\nfact did not preclude a finding that the racial isolation was also a ves-\ntige of past discrimination. Indeed, the Court held not only that it was\npermissible for the school board to take further action to desegregate,\nbut that the board was required to take further action in order to fulfill\nits \"affirmative duty\" to desegregate. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38.\n\n   Although Freeman recognized that, at a certain point in the process\nof desegregation, a court may determine that present racial isolation\ncannot be considered a by-product of the past regime of segregation,\nthe case does not require — or even empower — a school board\nunder a judicial desegregation order to make that determination on its\nown. Rather, so long as CMS was under court order to desegregate,\nit was required to treat racial isolation in its schools as a vestige of\nsegregation, and to take appropriate action to eliminate that vestige.\nSee Swann, 402 U.S. at 26.\n\nterns\" as one of several increasing strains on the pairing system); J.A.\n2712 (testimony of former CMS Superintendent John Murphy that \"[w]e\nreally weren’t going to be bringing about desegregation and racially bal-\nanced schools unless we began to address the issue of housing at the\nsame time.\"). The Board may have chosen sites for new schools in\nresponse to, or even in furtherance of, these demographic trends, see\nsupra, but in any event the Board also clearly evidenced awareness that\nthe population changes, particularly the greater distance between white\nand black population centers, would put a greater strain on the process\nof desegregation.\n\f162     BELK v.

Judge Potter rejected this argument,\nas do we (and the dissent, in never mentioning it, apparently also\nrejects it). The Capacchione plaintiffs rely on inapposite case law in\nattempting to establish that Board actions taken pursuant to court-\nordered desegregation decrees can be held unconstitutional.\n\n   Specifically, they rely on recent decisions finding voluntary, race-\nconscious magnet school programs (not developed under a governing\ndesegregation order) unconstitutional.

In fact, the courts\nemphasized in those cases that the school system had not been under\na court order to desegregate, see Eisenberg, 197 F.3d at 124, and had\nadopted a magnet program \"not to remedy past discrimination, but\nrather to promote racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity.\" Tuttle,\n195 F.3d at 700 (emphasis added); see also Wessman, 160 F.3d at 792\n(noting that prior to instituting its magnet program the school system\n\"had achieved unitariness in the area of student assignments\" and that\n\"the district court thereupon relinquished control over\" that area).\nIndeed, in Eisenberg we endorsed the permissibility of race-based\nclassifications \"in situations,\" like that at hand, \"where past constitu-\ntional violations require race-based remedial action.\" 197 F.3d at 130\n(citing Swann, 402 U.S. at 1); see also Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795.\n\n   The distinction between a unitary school system and a school sys-\ntem under court order to desegregate is, from a legal standpoint, fun-\ndamental. Furthermore, as discussed supra, it is the judicial finding\nof unitary status, not any particular action by the school board or con-\ndition in the school system, upon which the distinction turns. Of\ncourse, for a formerly segregated school system, the attainment of\nunitary status reflects years or decades of gradual change, not an over-\nnight shift in policy or outlook. Although CMS will not look much\ndifferent the day it becomes unitary than it will have looked the previ-\nous day, attainment of unitary status triggers significant legal conse-\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    163\nquences. In a non-unitary school system, all one-race or\npredominantly one-race schools are presumed to be vestiges of segre-\ngation, and the burden is on the challenging party to show that those\nschools are nondiscriminatory. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 26 (\"The court\nshould scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the school\nauthorities will be to satisfy the court that their racial composition is\nnot the result of present or past discriminatory action on their part.\").\nOnce a court has declared a school system unitary, on the other hand,\nthe presumption is that the vestiges of segregation have been elimi-\nnated, and a plaintiff seeking to demonstrate a constitutional violation\non the basis of the existence of one-race or predominantly one-race\nschools must \"prove discriminatory intent on the part of the school\nboard.\" Riddick, 784 F.2d at 537.\n\n   As Judge Potter recognized, see Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Therefore,\nrecent decisions, like Eisenberg and Tuttle, addressing the constitu-\ntionality of magnet school assignment policies in unitary school sys-\ntems not under court order, are simply inapposite.\n\n   Moreover, even if Tuttle and Eisenberg generally applied to gov-\nernmental acts performed pursuant to remedial desegregation orders\n(which they do not), the Board’s expanded magnet schools program\nwould withstand constitutional scrutiny. This is so because if a prece-\ndent of the Supreme Court \"has direct application in a case,\" inferior\ncourts must follow that precedent \"even if later cases appear to call\nit into question, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of\noverruling its own decisions.\" See Agostini v.

Here, the Supreme Court’s Swann decision itself constitutes\ndirectly controlling precedent. In Swann, the Court concluded that\nCMS could be constitutionally required to make efforts \"to reach a\n71-29 ratio\" in the schools under its authority, and to assign students\n\"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at var-\nious grade levels have about the same proportion of black and white\nstudents.\" See 402 U.S. at 23-25 (approving Judge McMillan’s order).\n\f164     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nIndeed, the Supreme Court again noted in Freeman that its decision\nin Swann specifically approved racial balancing by CMS to achieve\nthe remedial end of eliminating the vestiges of segregation. 503 U.S.\nat 493 (In Swann, \"[w]e confirmed that racial balance in school\nassignments was a necessary part of the remedy in the circumstances\nthere presented.\"). Under the principle articulated in Agostini, only\nthe Supreme Court itself can modify the decrees in this case to pro-\nhibit what Swann so clearly permitted.\n\n                                   D.\n\n   The Supreme Court’s decision in Swann is the law of the case; it\nmust be followed. But more than just the law of this case, for almost\nthirty years Swann also has functioned as a blueprint for school\ndesegregation in school districts throughout this Nation. As long as\nSwann is controlling law, and as long as the Board acts pursuant to\nthe Swann desegregation orders — as it did in implementing the\nexpanded magnet schools program — it cannot be held to have vio-\nlated the Constitution.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   Judge Potter also enjoined CMS from \"assigning children to\nschools or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through\nrace-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other means that deny\nstudents an equal footing based on race.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Indeed, in\nBuckhannon, the Supreme Court noted that statutory authority to\naward attorney’s fees is critical, for \"Congress ha[s] not ‘extended\nany roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or\notherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted.’\" Buck-\nhannon, 121 S.

Although a major-\nity of this Court has regrettably, and we believe mistakenly, deter-\nmined that CMS has attained unitary status, no member of the Court\nsuggests that in doing so, or in not doing so sooner, CMS violated 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 2000d, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Con-\nstitution, or any other law or constitutional provision that would give\nrise to an award of attorney’s fees under § 1988 or any other statute.29\n\n      and CMS’ magnet school admission policies. Therefore, the enti-\n      tlement of the Grant intervenors to recover attorneys’ fees is tied\n      directly to the merits of those claims.\nBrief of Appellants at 40 (emphasized language omitted in dissent, see\nTraxler Op. at 66). Of course, no plaintiff prevailed on the claim that the\n\"magnet school admission policies\" violated the Constitution, or any\nother claim that provided a statutory basis for attorney’s fees. Moreover,\neven if CMS had conceded to the contrary, there would be no basis for\na fee award.\n   29\n      We note that if CMS itself had succeeded in simply obtaining a dec-\nlaration that its school system was now unitary, no one would contend\nthat the Board would be entitled to an award of fees. Given this, how can\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs, operating as a \"private attorneys general\" on\nbehalf of the Board, Traxler Op. at 68, be entitled to fees?\n\f168     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nWhile some of the Capacchione plaintiffs had alleged that CMS’s\nfailure to obtain a declaration that it had attained unitary status vio-\nlated their constitutional rights, Judge Potter never so held. Tellingly,\non appeal, the Capacchione plaintiffs do not assert this position, let\nalone offer any support for it. Nor does any member of this Court\nembrace this unprecedented theory. Thus, there is no basis for an\naward of attorney’s fees here.\n\n   We note that, even if § 1988 somehow applied to a mere finding\nof unitary status, absent some additional finding of a constitutional or\ncivil rights violation, the Capacchione plaintiffs would still not be\nentitled to attorney’s fees because they do not qualify as \"prevailing\npart[ies].\" In order to be a \"prevailing party,\" a party seeking fees\nmust have obtained \"an enforceable judgment . . . consent decree or\nsettlement.\" Farrar v. Hobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (1992). Additionally,\nthere must be some defendant in the case who has been \"prevailed\nagainst,\" id. at 109, with a resulting \"material alteration of the legal\nrelationship\" between that defendant and the party seeking fees, id. at\n111.\n\n   This prevailing party requirement is crucial: in Buckhannon, the\nSupreme Court rejected the so-called \"catalyst theory\" of attorney’s\nfees on the ground that it might permit an award \"where there is no\njudicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\"\nBuckhannon, 121 S. Ct. at 1840. By simply obtaining a declaration\nthat the Board has achieved unitary status, the Capacchione plaintiffs\nhave not obtained \"an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settle-\nment;\" they have not \"prevailed against\" CMS; nor have they effected\na \"material alteration of the legal relationship\" between the parties.\n\n   Indeed, the declaration of unitary status merely restores the parties\nto the status quo prior to the issuance of the desegregation decree.\nSuch a declaration does not constitute \"an enforceable judgment\" for\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs. The dissent is mistaken in its assertion\nthat a unitary status declaration is \"enforceable against CMS in the\nunlikely event it later attempts to continue prior assignment policies.\"\nTraxler Op. at 68. Any challenge to future race-based assignment pol-\nicies would be on the ground that they violate the Constitution, not\nthat they violate a declaration of unitary status. Thus, a future chal-\nlenge would seek to \"enforce\" the Constitution, not the unitary status\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION     169\ndetermination. This point highlights the heart of the dissent’s misun-\nderstanding. Section 1988 exists to provide attorney’s fees for those\nplaintiffs who demonstrate that they suffered deprivations of rights\nunder federal civil rights laws or the Constitution. Today, a majority\nof this Court has held that the Capacchione plaintiffs have suffered\nno such deprivation; thus, they are not entitled to statutory attorney’s\nfees.\n\n   Although the declaration of unitary status represents a rejection of\nthe legal position that CMS has taken in this litigation, such a defeat\nis not tantamount to being \"prevailed against\" under § 1988. See\nBuckhannon, 121 S. Ct. at 1841 (\"We cannot agree that the term ‘pre-\nvailing party’ authorizes federal courts to award attorney’s fees to a\nplaintiff who . . . has reached the ‘sought-after destination’ without\nobtaining any judicial relief.\"). Rather, the primary significance of a\ndeclaration of unitary status is that CMS has been successful; it has\neradicated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable\nand, as the Capacchione plaintiffs put it, obtained a \"return of control\nto local authorities.\" Brief of Appellees at 34. The Board, upon a dec-\nlaration of unitariness, now actually has wider latitude to assign stu-\ndents than it did while it was under court order to remedy past\ndiscrimination (although certain race-conscious policies might no lon-\nger be permissible). Accordingly, this declaration of Board success,\nand attendant broadening of the Board’s discretion, does not consti-\ntute an alteration of the parties’ legal relationship \"in a way that\ndirectly benefits the plaintiff.\" Farrar, 506 U.S. at 112 (emphasis\nadded). Without more, the declaration that CMS has achieved unitary\nstatus does not place any direct benefit on the Capacchione plaintiffs,\nwho \"obtain[ ] nothing from the defendants.\" Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111929\"><a href=\"/opinion/111929/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 761-62 (1987).30\n  30\n     The dissent’s contention that the Capacchione plaintiffs helped \"in\nmaking unitariness a reality\" underscores the dissent’s confusion as to\nthe difference between seeking injunctive relief to eliminate illegal seg-\nregation connected with a dual school system with a declaration that this\nhas been done. The former is an action to \"enforce\" civil rights laws and\nthe Constitution — and therefore contemplated by § 1988 — and the lat-\nter is a statement that earlier enforcement efforts have succeeded for rea-\nsons having nothing to do with the Capacchione plaintiffs’ lawsuit.\n\f170    BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n   Moreover, \"only those changes in a defendant’s conduct which are\nmandated by a judgment . . . in the case at bar may be considered by\nthe court in determining the plaintiff’s success at trial\" for purposes\nof attorney’s fees under § 1988. Clark v. Sims, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (4th\nCir. 1994) (emphasis added). In affirming the district court’s unitary\nstatus determination, this Court does not mandate that CMS engage\nin any \"conduct\" whatsoever, but simply holds that \"CMS has com-\nplied in good faith with the mandate of Brown,\" and that the \"dual\nsystem has been dismantled.\" Traxler Op. at 43. By vacating the\naward of nominal damages and injunctive relief, this Court has\nremoved any \"mandate\" on the actions of the district court. Having\nbeen determined to be unitary, CMS is now free to take whatever\naction it wishes consistent with the Constitution.\n\n   Thus, the Capacchione plaintiffs’ suit seeking a declaration of uni-\ntary status was not an \"action to enforce\" the civil rights laws under\n§ 1988. Rather, these plaintiffs sought a declaration that CMS has\ncomplied with judgments obtained by the Swann plaintiffs in previous\nactions to enforce civil rights. Although the Capacchione plaintiffs\nbrought separate § 1983 claims asserting that the expanded magnet\nschools program violated the Equal Protection Clause, they have not\n\"prevail[ed]\" on those claims.\n\n   In sum, not only is there no statutory authority to award attorney’s\nfees here, but even if such authority were present, the Capacchione\nplaintiffs are not prevailing parties under § 1988. For these reasons,\nthere is no basis for an award of any attorney’s fees in this case.\n\n                                 VII.\n\n   Finally, CMS appeals the district court’s order awarding sanctions\n— including legal fees and costs — to the Capacchione plaintiffs\narising from a discovery dispute. In the months before trial, CMS did\nnot respond to interrogatories by the Capacchione plaintiffs seeking\ndisclosure of fact witnesses. Instead, the Board waited until the week\nbefore trial to reveal the names of most of its fact witnesses, provid-\ning the Capacchione plaintiffs with a list of 174 names which it ulti-\nmately narrowed to twenty-six potential witnesses. The Board\nmaintains that its actions complied with the district court’s pretrial\norder, which required the parties to provide a list of fact witnesses to\n\f       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    171\neach other \"[n]o later than the morning of the first day of trial.\" J.A.\n150.\n\n   The district court, however, granted the Capacchione plaintiffs’\nmotion for sanctions. The court held that it had established the rules\nfor disclosure of fact witnesses in an order of September 1998, which\nsuperseded the pretrial order. The September 1998 order denied the\nCapacchione plaintiffs’ motion to compel disclosure of witnesses\nprior to the date established in the pretrial order for disclosure of\nexpert witnesses, but the court stated that \"CMS must supplement its\nresponses, as it promised, when such information becomes known.\"\nJ.A. 195. In awarding sanctions, the district court also indicated its\nconcern that CMS had been \"lacking candor in disclosing relevant\nand important information\" during the pretrial stage, that the disclo-\nsure of a list of 174 potential witnesses in the week before trial was\n\"extremely prejudicial to opposing counsel,\" and that many of the\nwitnesses on the list may have been \"irrelevant or unnecessarily\ncumulative.\" J.A. 305. As a result, the district court ordered a one-\nweek recess after the Capacchione plaintiffs’ presentation at trial to\nallow them to depose, at the school system’s expense, any of the\ntwenty-six witnesses on the Board’s revised list. Witnesses whom the\nBoard did not make available for deposition or interview during the\nmid-trial recess were barred from testifying.\n\n   \"Rule 37(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gives the dis-\ntrict court wide discretion to impose sanctions for a party’s failure to\ncomply with its discovery orders.\" Mutual Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v.\nRichards & Ass’ns., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521055\"><a href=\"/opinion/521055/mutual-federal-savings-and-loan-association-a-federal-savings-and-loan/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (4th Cir. 1989). CMS could\nplausibly have understood the deadline for disclosure of fact wit-\nnesses contained in the pretrial order to have continued in effect after\nthe subsequent September 1998 order given that the subsequent\norder’s central effect was to reaffirm the deadline contained in the\npretrial order for disclosure of expert witnesses. Nonetheless, we can-\nnot say that the district court abused its broad discretion in finding\nthat its September 1998 order did in fact supersede the pretrial order,\nand that the Board’s pretrial conduct had been unnecessarily dilatory\nand prejudicial to the Capacchione plaintiffs. Therefore the order of\nsanctions against CMS must be affirmed.\n\f172     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\n                                  VIII.\n\n   We must and do sympathize with those who are impatient with\ncontinued federal court involvement in the operation of local schools.\nOne might consider thirty-five years a long time for a school district\nto operate under judicial desegregation decrees. However, when the\nSupreme Court decided Swann in 1971 no one could reasonably have\nthought that the substantial task described there would be quickly or\neasily accomplished. CMS, which maintained a separate, decidedly\nunequal dual educational system for decades — and which mightily\nresisted desegregation of any sort for years after it became the law of\nthe land — has come a long way. Although CMS has now achieved\nunitary status in certain respects, the record in this case simply does\nnot support a determination that the process of desegregation is at an\nend.\n\n   For more than a hundred years, in fits and starts, our nation has\nattempted to undo the effects of its shameful heritage of slavery. For\nnearly fifty years, federal courts have struggled with the task of dis-\nmantling legally enforced racial segregation in many of our schools.\nThis task has given rise to one of the preeminent issues of constitu-\ntional law in our time. We do not yet know how history will regard\nthe courts’ role in adjudicating and presiding over the desegregation\nof schools. It may be seen as a brief and unfortunate jurisprudential\nanomaly, justified only by the immediacy of the evil it was intended\nto uproot, cf. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 505-07 (Scalia, J., concurring); or\nit may be recognized as the necessarily sustained effort to eradicate\ndeep-seated vestiges of racial discrimination and to vindicate the\npromise of the Fourteenth Amendment, cf. Dowell, 498 U.S. at 266-\n68 (Marshall, J., dissenting); or it may be viewed in some other way\nthat we cannot now anticipate.\n\n   But we are certain that the end of this great task must be accom-\nplished in an orderly manner, consistent with and true to its origin.\nWe are certain, too, that if the courts, at some point, come to view the\neffort to eliminate the vestiges of segregation as having been overly\n\"race-conscious,\" they must do so with a clear assessment of the his-\ntorical record.\n\n   Race neutrality, of course, represents one of our constitutional\nideals. Properly understood, it is an ideal not at all in tension with our\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION    173\nobligation as a society to undo the effects of slavery and of the racial\ncaste system that was perpetuated, for more than a century, in slav-\nery’s wake. But we must be ever mindful, as we strive for race neu-\ntrality, that a reductive and willfully ahistorical conception of race\nneutrality was, in an earlier era, used as a blunt instrument against the\naspirations of African-Americans merely seeking to claim entitlement\nto full citizenship.\n\n   In striking down early civil rights legislation, the Supreme Court\nembraced this misconceived race neutrality, reasoning, only twenty\nyears after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, that the\nlegislation at issue would illegitimately make black citizens \"the spe-\ncial favorite of the laws.\" Civil Rights Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90897\"><a href=\"/opinion/90897/civil-rights-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1883).\nIndeed, the system of segregation with which we are concerned was\njustified at its inception by a particular conception of race neutrality\n— that a regime of racial separation could be constitutionally justified\nso long as it applied neutrally and equally to persons of all races. See\nPlessy v. Ferguson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551 (1896) (\"We consider the\nunderlying fallacy of the plaintiff’s argument to consist in the\nassumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the\ncolored race with a badge of inferiority.\").\n\n   The first Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy, declared our Consti-\ntution to be \"color-blind,\" id., 163 U.S. at 559, and in doing so pro-\nvided one of the most famous and compelling articulations of the\nconstitutional guarantee of equality. But in urging us to be \"blind\" to\nrace, Justice Harlan did not, as is sometimes suggested, suggest that\nwe be ignorant of it. In Plessy, he was the only member of the Court\nwilling to acknowledge the most obvious truth about segregation:\n\"Everyone knows that the statute in question had its origin in the pur-\npose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occu-\npied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied\nor assigned to white persons.\" Id. at 557. Thirteen years earlier, dis-\nsenting in the Civil Rights Cases, Justice Harlan rejected the notion\nthat civil rights legislation made blacks a \"special favorite of the\nlaws,\" id., 109 U.S. at 61, and he criticized the majority’s reasoning\nas \"narrow and artificial.\" Id. at 26.\n\n   We recognize now, as Justice Harlan recognized then, that no sim-\nple syllogism can enfold all of history’s burdens and complexities.\n\f174     BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nEliminating race-consciousness from government decision making\nmust be regarded as among our worthiest constitutional aspirations.\nBut that aspiration surely cannot be so rigid that it refuses to distin-\nguish the \"race consciousness\" that created a segregated school sys-\ntem and the race-conscious efforts necessary to eliminate that system.\nWhile most judges are not historians, we must be willing to acknowl-\nedge and confront our history. If we fail to do so, we risk falling into\na mode that equates the cure with the disease: civil rights with favorit-\nism, desegregation with segregation. As American citizens, we know\nbetter.\n\n   We are honored to state that Judge Michael and Judge Gregory join\nin this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
