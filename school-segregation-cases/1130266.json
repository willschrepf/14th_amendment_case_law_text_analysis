PRADO, Circuit Judge:\n      Anibal Canales (“Canales”) was sentenced to death following his\nconviction for the capital murder of Gary Dickerson (“Dickerson”). The Texas\nCourt of Criminal Appeals (“CCA”) affirmed his conviction and sentence on\ndirect appeal, Canales v. State, 98 S.W.3d 690 (Tex. Crim. App.), cert. denied,\n540 U.S. 1051 (2003), and denied his first application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus, Ex parte Canales, No. 54,789-01 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr. 5, 2003).\n      Canales filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district\ncourt in 2004; the district court stayed proceedings to allow Canales to file a\nsuccessive state habeas petition. The CCA denied his successive state habeas\npetition in 2008. Ex parte Canales, No. WR-54789-02, 2008 WL 383804 (Tex.\n\f    Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279       Page: 2    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nCrim.

The district court found he had procedurally defaulted all\nof his claims except his shackling claim, which it denied.\n      The district court then granted Canales a certificate of appealability\n(“COA”) on eight claims:\n         1. Canales received ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n            (Wiggins Claim)\n         2. The trial court’s rulings violated Canales’s right to present a\n            defense.\n         3. The state used another inmate, who was working as a state\n            agent, to solicit incriminating evidence in violation of his\n            rights to assistance of counsel and due process of law.\n            (Massiah Claim)\n         4.

The cumulative effect of his ineffective assistance of counsel\n            and the withholding of evidence violated his right to due\n            process.\n         6. Jurors lied about their criminal backgrounds, which violated\n            his rights to due process of law, fair trial, and to be free from\n            cruel and unusual punishment.\n         7. The jury communicated with the court and with the bailiff\n            outside his and his counsel’s presence during deliberations,\n            which violated his rights to due process of law, fair trial, and\n            to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\n         8. Canales was shackled during the punishment phase of his\n            trial in violation of his rights to due process of law, to remain\n            silent, and to a fair trial.\n      For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court on Canales’s\nclaim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing, and\nwe remand that issue to the district court. We affirm the district court on all\nother claims.\n\n                                        2\n\f     Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279     Page: 3   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.     Factual Background\n       On July 1, 1997, prison officials caught Larry “Dirty” Dickerson\n(“Dickerson), an inmate at the Telford Unit of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice (“the Unit”), with contraband that belonged to another prison\ngang. Dickerson told another inmate, James Baker (“Baker”), that if Baker\ndid not help him avoid retaliation from the gang whose contraband was stolen,\nDickerson would tell prison officials about a large quantity of tobacco that was\nto be smuggled into the prison the next day.\n       The next day, prison officials intercepted a shipment of contraband\ntobacco intended for Baker and the Texas Mafia, a prison gang. When the\ntobacco was intercepted, Dickerson was placed in administrative segregation.\nAt his own request, he returned to the general population about a week later.\nDickerson was found dead in his cell on July 11, 1997. Prison authorities\ninitially concluded that Dickerson had died of natural causes. Only after\nconducting an autopsy did the State conclude that Dickerson had actually been\nstrangled.\n       The Texas Mafia had a financial stake in the intercepted contraband\ntobacco and arranged for Dickerson’s murder. See Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 693.\nCanales, who was also an inmate in the Unit, was a member of the Texas\nMafia. According to the magistrate judge’s summary of the facts Canales and\nthree other Texas Mafia members—William Speer (“Speer”), Jessie Barnes,\nand Michael Constantine—agreed to murder Dickerson. Canales and Speer\nwent to Dickerson’s cell, and while Canales held him down, Speer strangled\nhim.\n       In 1998, Canales sent a letter to Bruce Innes (“Innes”) in which he\ndescribed Dickerson’s murder and the Texas Mafia’s interest in it. The letter\nwas admitted into evidence at trial.\n                                       3\n\f    Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 4   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\n      Dirty [Dickerson] lit the smoke and we smoked. When the last hit\n      was took he was down by the vent on his knee and Puff [Speer]\n      behind and me at the door. Puff put the hold on him and I grabbed\n      his arms. It went smooth! He lost consciousness right away and\n      strugled (sic) for a little bit. I took the time to inform Him who we\n      were and why he’s going to die. Puff told him . . “Don’t even fuck\n      with the Texas-MAFIA in hell!!” Ha! Ha! Ha! Anyway. . . we made\n      sure the dick sucker was dead and I declared the hit complete. We\n      put his shit smelling ass in the top bunk and went quietly out the\n      door. I went to the yard with minutes to spare!!\nR. at 2355 (magistrate judge’s summary of the facts) (alterations in original)\n(emphasis omitted).\n      Canales was indicted for capital murder in November 1999. In February\n2000, he sent another letter to Innes. As the district court described the letter,\n“although written in code, [it] appeared to ask the gang to retaliate against\nLarry (“Iron-head”) Whited because he believed Whited had informed prison\nauthorities about his role in the killing.” The district court also included the\nletter:\n      Greetings, Sir . . As always, I come to you and all worthy with my\n      utmost respects (sic)! I realize that I just recently sent you a letter\n      but it has become imperative that I write you again, as you’ll see\n      . . First, I arrived at bowie county court on 2-7-00 and was\n      arraigned for several charges.            Mr.s Speers barnes and\n      Constinetine were also there. . I must tell you that the worst has\n      been done and its (sic) one of the charges (Main one actually)\n      Glarinly (sic) absent was that iron headed fella . . He was not\n      charged, which is good .. Eh? Seems that iron obes (sic) bend to\n      the will of the state or not. I personally think so.\n      Perhaps some effort can be used to throw that useless material to\n      the scrap yard. . I can’t stress how important this is. As you know\n      Iron can be shaped into what you want it to look like and not in a\n      good way sir!! If this can’t be done then I’ll need to ask for legal-\n      assistance from other arenas .. And that’s not to(sic) cool!\n      Maximum effort Ace, Maximum!! Now, I will also get with Mr. JR\n      on the others who are involved and can help get it all in order.\n      Also, it’s possible that a legal defense fund will be placed to help\n\n                                        4\n\f     Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 5    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-70034\n       with council, (sic) legal material, clothes (for court) I’ll have our\n       attorney (who’s a freeworld) get it together and put out flyers to all\n       the best.\n       We’ll need ya’lls (sic) help fellas and I can’t stress how important\n       it is to file that writ of dismissal in this area on that pile of scrap!\n       This in itself would be tremendous in assisting this legal case!\n       That’s how important it is . . . You take care fellas and put out the\n       word that help is needed on this from all areas. . . . We continue\n       the struggle,\n       In solidarity\n       Bigfoot..\nR. at 2356–57 (emphasis omitted). This letter was also admitted into evidence\nat trial.\n       In April 2000, Canales wrote a third letter to another inmate, which read\nin part:\n       Yeah bubba, I’ve been bummed a bit, just a small funk, no sweat ..\n       A lot has to do with my case and its outcome or the way I see it.\n       It’s not good , and I’ve got a few making matters worse with their\n       mouths! I was here with Tony Rice, I know him and his case and\n       I know how it came about, I was in super seg with him there in 85\n       and then we were all on the same wing (L -Wing) in 86-87 and we\n       got tight. I saw the downfall and how it came about and who was\n       responsible! I’ve got snakes in the yard and it’s getting worse from\n       the crap coming outta the mouths of so-called homies. One\n       dayroom call homeboy, and I’ll get it all straight! Bet that! But\n       what can I do? Nothink! Nada! Zero! Zip! 0! But, I’m a firm\n       believer that what goes around, comes around! And that what you\n       sow, you reap! So, I’ll be content with justice in the end. TDC is\n       not big, at all! So ......\nR. at 2357. The State also introduced this letter into evidence at trial.\n       The 1998 letter was particularly important in the guilt phase, and the\nother two letters were used at punishment phase to help establish “future\ndangerousness,” the special issue that led to his capital sentence. Canales, 98\nS.W.3d at 699. The State also used several inmates as witnesses, including\n\n                                          5\n\f     Case: 12-70034        Document: 00512752279          Page: 6     Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-70034\nInnes (who allegedly started working as a State agent in 1999 or 2000), Richard\nDriver, Jr., and Doyle Hill.\nB.    Procedural Background\n      Canales was convicted of capital murder in state district court, and based\non the jury’s answers to special issues under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure\narticle 37.071, the court sentenced him to death.                   The CCA affirmed his\nsentence on direct appeal. Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 700. Canales also filed a\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court, presenting ninety-seven\nissues for review; the CCA denied his petition. Ex parte Canales, No. 54,789-\n01 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr. 5, 2003).\n      In 2004, Canales filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal\ndistrict court in the Eastern District of Texas. His petition raised thirteen\nclaims, including the eight on which the district court granted a COA. Canales\nfiled a motion to stay his habeas proceedings so that he could return to state\ncourt to exhaust the new claims that he had filed based on evidence that, he\nalleged, had been suppressed. The district court granted his motion and stayed\nproceedings.\n      Canales presented his petition to the CCA, and the CCA asked for\nadditional briefing on Canales ineffective assistance claims. Ex parte Canales,\nNo. WR-54,789-02, 2008 WL 383804, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Feb. 13, 2008) (per\ncuriam) (unpublished). The CCA dismissed his application as an abuse of the\nwrit under article 11.071, § 5(c) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. 1\n      Canales then returned to federal district court.                   The district court\ngranted discovery, allowing Canales to investigate his claims of state\nmisconduct and jury irregularity.              More than three years later, Canales\nsupplemented his habeas petition with additional evidence and arguments\n\n\n      1   See infra Part III(B) for a more detailed discussion of the CCA’s ruling.\n                                               6\n\f     Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 7    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nregarding the evidence the State allegedly withheld. The case was referred to\na magistrate judge.      The magistrate judge recommended that Canales’s\npetition be denied because the claims were procedurally defaulted and Canales\ncould not prove cause and prejudice. The district court accepted the magistrate\njudge’s report and recommendation with slight modifications; the court chose\nnot to reach certain parts of Canales’s Massiah and Brady claims because, even\nif true, Canales could not prove prejudice. The district court granted a COA\non eight issues listed above.\n                        II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      “In an appeal of the district court’s denial of habeas relief, this court\nreviews the district court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of\nlaw de novo, applying the same standard of review that the district court\napplied to the state court decision.” Roberts v. Thaler, 681 F.3d 597, 603 (5th\nCir. 2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The standard of\nreview that we apply to each claim, however, depends on whether the claim\nhas previously been adjudicated on the merits in state court.\nA.    Independent and Adequate State Grounds\n      Federal courts lack jurisdiction to review a habeas claim “if the last state\ncourt to consider that claim expressly relied on a state ground for denial of\nrelief that is both independent of the merits of the federal claim and an\nadequate basis for the court’s decision.”      Id. at 604 (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted). So, as a general rule, “a state prisoner’s habeas\nclaims may not be entertained by a federal court when (1) a state court [has]\ndeclined to address [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a\nstate procedural requirement, and (2) the state judgment rests on independent\nand adequate state procedural grounds.” Maples v. Thomas, 132 S. Ct. 912, 922\n(2012) (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). There is,\nhowever, an exception to this rule. A federal court may consider the merits of\n                                         7\n\f     Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279      Page: 8   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\na procedurally defaulted claim if the petitioner shows “cause for the default\nand prejudice from a violation of federal law.” Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct.\n1309, 1316 (2012) (citing Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991)).\n      In order to demonstrate cause, the habeas petitioner must “show that\nsome objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel’s efforts to raise\nthe claim in state court.” McClesky v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 493 (1991) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Examples of these objective factors\ninclude “interference by officials that makes compliance with the State’s\nprocedural rule impracticable, and a showing that the factual or legal basis for\na claim was not reasonably available to counsel.” Id. at 494 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).      “[T]he question is whether petitioner\npossessed, or by reasonable means could have obtained, a sufficient basis to\nallege a claim in the first petition and pursue the matter through the habeas\nprocess.” Id. at 498. Once cause has been established, the habeas petitioner\nmust then show “actual prejudice.” United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 167\n(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted). This means the petitioner must\nprove that the errors “worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage,\ninfecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.” Id. at 170.\nB.    AEDPA Deference\n      If, however, a state court adjudicated the claim on the merits, a different\nstandard of review applies under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”), §§ 101-108, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214\n(codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2253-2266). A federal court may\nnot grant habeas relief to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state\ncourt, unless the state court’s adjudication\n      (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n      unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n      determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 9   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\n      (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\n      determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n      State court proceeding.\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). This is also known as AEDPA deference.\n      A state court decision can be contrary to Supreme Court precedent in two\nways: (1) if “‘the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by\n[the Supreme Court] on a question of law’; or (2) ‘the state court confronts facts\nthat are materially indistinguishable from a relevant Supreme Court\nprecedent and arrives at a result opposite to [that of the Supreme Court].’”\nPippin v. Dretke, 434 F.3d 782, 787 (5th Cir. 2005) (alterations in original)\n(quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405 (2000)). “A state court’s decision\nis an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law whenever the\nstate court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme\nCourt’s decisions but applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner’s case in\nan objectively unreasonable manner.” Id. (quoting Young v. Dretke, 356 F.3d\n616, 623 (5th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted)).                  “An\nunreasonable application may also occur if ‘the state court either unreasonably\nextends a legal principle from [Supreme Court] precedent to a new context\nwhere it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a\nnew context where it should apply.’” Id. at 787–88 (alteration in original)\n(quoting Young, 356 F.3d at 623).       The state court’s factual findings are\npresumed to be correct unless a petitioner “rebut[s] the presumption of\ncorrectness by clear and convincing evidence.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n                              III. DISCUSSION\n      Our discussion proceeds in three parts.         First we address Texas’s\nargument that the COA is invalid for several of Canales’s claims. Next, we\ndetermine whether the CCA’s dismissal of Canales’s petition for a writ of\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f     Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279     Page: 10    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nhabeas corpus was based on independent and adequate state grounds. Then,\nwe turn to the eight claims on which the district court granted Canales a COA.\nA.     Validity of the COA\n       “Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an\nappeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas\ncorpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process\nissued by a State court.”       28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A).      “A certificate of\nappealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a\nsubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” Id. § 2253(c)(2).\nThe COA “shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing\nrequired” in § 2253(c)(2). Id. § 2253(c)(3).\n       Texas argues that the COA is invalid as to Canales’s ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims, his claim that the trial court rulings deprived him\nof his right to present a defense, his cumulative impact claim, and his jury\nclaims. As Texas points out, if the district court denies a habeas petition on\nprocedural grounds, a COA should only issue if “the prisoner shows, at least,\nthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid\nclaim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would\nfind it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural\nruling.” See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000) (emphasis added).\nTexas claims that the district court only found that its merits rulings were\ndebatable; the district court did not make the requisite determination that its\nprocedural rulings were debatable. Thus, according to the State, the COA is\ninvalid, and we should dismiss these five claims due to procedural default.\n       We disagree.     First, despite the seemingly mandatory language of\n§ 2253(c)(3), the failure of the COA to meet the requirements of § 2253(c)(3)\ndoes not deprive this court of jurisdiction. Gonzalez v. Thaler, 132 S. Ct. 641,\n652 (2012). Second, the procedural rulings in this case are complicated, and\n                                        10\n\f     Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279      Page: 11   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nthe parties devote a significant portion of their briefing to arguing about\nwhether the district court correctly determined that Canales’s claims were\nprocedurally defaulted.     Thus, even though the district court did not\nspecifically state that its procedural rulings were debatable, they are, see infra\nPart III(B), and so the district court was correct to issue the COA. Thus,\nbecause the § 2253(c)(3) requirement is not jurisdictional and the procedural\nrulings are debatable, we decline to hold that the COA is invalid.\nB.     Independent and Adequate State Grounds\n       “[W]hen . . . a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on\nfederal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy\nand independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of\nthe opinion,” the Supreme Court has directed federal courts to “accept as the\nmost reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it\ndid because it believed that federal law required it to do so.” Michigan v. Long,\n463 U.S. 1032, 1040–41 (1983). If, however, “it does not fairly appear that the\nstate court rested its decision primarily on federal grounds, it is simply not\ntrue that the ‘most reasonable explanation’ is that the state judgment rested\non federal grounds.” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 737. “This distinction matters in a\nSection 2254 proceeding because [this Court] do[es] not reach the merits when\nthe state court denied relief due to an adequate state law basis for the decision,\nindependent of the merits of the federal claim.” Balentine v. Thaler, 626 F.3d\n842, 849 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Coleman, 501 U.S. at 729).\n       The CCA dismissed Canales’s state habeas petition as an abuse of the\nwrit, which this Court “[has] long acknowledged . . . can sometimes qualify as\nan independent and adequate state-law ground that functions as a procedural\nbar to federal-court merits review of habeas claims.” Rocha v. Thaler (Rocha\nII), 626 F.3d 815, 829 (5th Cir. 2010). Under Texas law, when a petitioner files\na subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus, a court “may not consider\n                                       11\n\f    Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 12    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nthe merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application” unless the\npetitioner shows:\n      (1) the current claims and issues have not been and could not have\n      been presented previously in a timely initial application or in a\n      previously considered application filed under this article or Article\n      11.07 because the factual or legal basis for the claim was\n      unavailable on the date the applicant filed the previous\n      application;\n      (2) by a preponderance of the evidence, but for a violation of the\n      United States Constitution no rational juror could have found the\n      applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; or\n      (3) by clear and convincing evidence, but for a violation of the\n      United States Constitution no rational juror would have answered\n      in the state’s favor one or more of the special issues that were\n      submitted to the jury in the applicant's trial under Article 37.071,\n      37.0711, or 37.072.\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, § 5(a). If the petitioner fails to meet\nthe requirements in § 5(a), the CCA dismisses the petition as an abuse of the\nwrit. Id. § 5(c).\n      The CCA has interpreted § 5(a)(1) as actually involving two steps: (1) the\nlegal or factual basis of the claims were previously unavailable and (2) “the\nspecific facts alleged, if established, would constitute a constitutional violation\nthat would likely require relief from conviction.”      Ex parte Campbell, 226\nS.W.3d 418, 421 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). “Whether a § 5(a)(1) dismissal is\nindependent of federal law turns on case specific factors. If the CCA’s decision\nrests on availability, the procedural bar is intact.” Rocha II, 626 F.3d at 835.\nIf, on the other hand, “the CCA determines the claim was unavailable but that\n[the habeas petitioner did] not make a prima facie showing of merit, a federal\ncourt can review that under the [standard set out in § 2254(d)]”. Id. This Court\nhas interpreted Campbell to mean that the CCA applies the separate § 5(a)(1)\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f      Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279     Page: 13   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nsteps sequentially. Id. at 834. If the CCA dismisses the petition under § 5(a)(2)\nor § 5(a)(3), this Court can also review it under the standard in § 2254(d).\n        The issue here is more complicated because the CCA dismissed Canales’s\nsubsequent habeas petition as an abuse of the writ under § 5(a) without\nspecifying whether it was doing so based on availability or based on the merits.\nSee Ex parte Canales, 2008 WL 383804, at *1 (“We have reviewed the\napplication and the briefs of both parties and find that all of the allegations\nfail to satisfy the requirements of Article 11.071, § 5(a).”). This Court has\ndiscussed how to deal with the CCA’s boilerplate dismissal for an abuse of the\nwrit before. See, e.g., Balentine, 626 F.3d at 849–57; Hughes v. Quarterman,\n530 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir. 2008) (nothing in CCA’s “perfunctory dismissal” of\nthe petition “suggest[ed] that it actually considered or ruled on the merits”).\nWe have explained that we must first determine if the state court decision\n“fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the\nfederal law.” Rocha II, 626 F.3d at 836 (quoting Coleman, 501 U.S. at 735)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “There must be more than silence. In\nsome form, the state court has to make a fair indication that the merits of the\nclaim were reached.” Balentine, 626 F.3d at 854. When the dismissal is silent,\nthis Court looks to the arguments made in state court to try to determine\nwhether the dismissal was based on independent and adequate state law or\nwhether instead it relied on or was interwoven with federal law. Id. at 854–\n56.\n        Here, the CCA’s dismissal of Canales’s petition did not specify on which\nsubsection of § 5(a) it rested. But the order did explain that the CCA had asked\nfor additional briefing on the following questions:\n        (1) Is Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 527 (2003), new law or such\n        an extension of old law that this Court should hold that it meets\n        the dictates of Article 11.071 § 5?\n\n                                       13\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 14   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\n      (2) If Wiggins is new law or such an extension of old law that it\n      should meet the dictates of Article 11.071 § 5, under what standard\n      should a court judge the effectiveness of counsel’s actions\n      undertaken before the decision in Wiggins was announced?\nEx parte Canales, 2008 WL 383804 at *1.\n      Canales uses this request for additional briefing to argue that the CCA’s\ndismissal was not independent of federal law. He points out that the CCA\nspecifically asked for briefing on the merits of his Wiggins claim. Canales also\nargues that the CCA knows how to make a clear statement that it is not\nreaching the merits, see, e.g., Ex parte Foster, No. WR-65,799-03, at *2 (Tex.\nCrim. App. Sept. 12, 2011) (unpublished); because the CCA did not make a\nclear statement that it was avoiding the merits, Canales argues, the CCA\nactually reached the merits. Finally, Canales attempts to distinguish his case\nfrom others where we have found that a boilerplate dismissal was independent\nof federal law. He claims that in those cases, the habeas petitioner had not\nargued he could prove his claim was unavailable at the time of his first state\nhabeas application. See, e.g., Balentine, 626 F.3d at 855. But Canales argued\nthat he could show that his claim was unavailable, and thus he urges us to\nhold that the CCA reached the merits of his petition.\n      We find these arguments unpersuasive, and we hold that the CCA’s\ndismissal of Canales’s petition was based on independent and adequate state\ngrounds. First, we consider all of Canales’s claims except his Wiggins claim.\nWe begin by noting that there is no indication that the CCA reached the merits\nof any these claims. See Puckett v. Epps, 641 F.3d 657, 665 (5th Cir. 2011) (“To\navoid procedural bar, in some form, the state court has to make a fair indication\nthat the merits of the claim were reached.” (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Canales’s subsequent state habeas petition confirms that we\nshould apply a procedural bar to these claims. Canales did not ask the CCA to\nreach the merits of his claims. Instead, he argued that the legal and factual\n                                       14\n\f   Case: 12-70034      Document: 00512752279    Page: 15   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nbases of his claims were previously unavailable under Texas Code of Criminal\nProcedure article 11.071, § 5(a)(1), and he asked the CCA to remand his claims\nto state district court. The fact that the CCA dismissed his petition as an abuse\nof the writ, instead of remanding them to state district court for a merits\ndetermination, shows that the CCA dismissed them pursuant to § 5(a)(1). We\nhave previously held that “the Texas abuse of the writ doctrine has been\nconsistently applied as a procedural bar, and that it is an independent and\nadequate state ground for the purpose of imposing a procedural bar.” Hughes,\n530 F.3d at 342; see also Rocha II, 626 F.3d at 835 (“If the CCA’s decision rests\non availability, the procedural bar is intact.”). Thus, we apply the procedural\nbar to these claims.\n      While the question of whether the CCA’s dismissal of Canales’s Wiggins\nclaim is interwoven with federal law is more difficult to resolve, we hold that\nthe procedural bar applies to his Wiggins claim. As Canales points out, there\nis some indication that the CCA may have reached the merits of Canales’s\nWiggins claim: the CCA asked for briefing on the merits of that claim. So, we\nmust look to the arguments made in state court to try to determine whether\nthe dismissal was based on independent and adequate state law or whether\ninstead it relied on or was interwoven with federal law. See Balentine, 626\nF.3d at 854–56. In his subsequent state habeas petition, Canales argued that\n“the legal basis for his claims was previously unavailable.” See Tex. Code Crim.\nProc. Ann. art. 11.071, § 59(a)(1). As with his other claims, Canales did not\nask the CCA to reach the merits of his Wiggins claim. While he argued that\nhe could meet the standards set out in § 5(a)(2) and § 5(a)(3), he did not ask\nthe CCA to make that decision, instead asking the CCA to remand his Wiggins\nclaim to Texas state district court. As we discussed above, the CCA’s decision\nto dismiss his application without remanding it to the state district court shows\nthat its decision rested on independent and adequate state grounds.           Cf.\n                                       15\n\f     Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279      Page: 16    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nColeman, 501 U.S. at 744 (“There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme\nCourt’s ‘consideration’ of all filed papers [which discussed the merits of\nColeman’s federal claims] adds some ambiguity, but we simply cannot read it\nas overriding the court’s explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on\nprocedural grounds. Those grounds are independent of federal law.”).\n       Thus, we hold that a procedural bar applies to all of Canales’s claims.\nC.     Claims on which the District Court Granted a COA\n       As discussed above, we agree with the district court’s decision to apply a\nprocedural bar to all of Canales’s claims. Because his claims are procedurally\ndefaulted, we will not review them unless Canales “can demonstrate cause for\nthe default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation[s] of federal\nlaw.” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749.\n       1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (Wiggins Claim)\n       Canales argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during\nboth the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. When the district court\nconsidered these claims, it found that Canales could not prove cause and\nprejudice to excuse the procedural default. But since the district court issued\nits opinion, the Supreme Court has clarified the ways a habeas petitioner can\nshow cause to excuse a procedural default.\n       The district court’s procedural ruling relied on our decision in Ibarra v.\nThaler, 687 F.3d 222 (2012), overruled by Trevino v. Thaler, 133 S. Ct. 1911\n(2013). Ibarra held that Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012), did not apply\nin Texas. In Martinez, the Supreme Court considered for the first time whether\nineffective assistance of counsel in an initial-review collateral proceeding could\nprovide cause to excuse procedural default of a claim for ineffective assistance\nof trial counsel. Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1316. The Supreme Court answered\nin the affirmative, holding that when an initial-review collateral proceeding is\nthe first time a petitioner can raise a claim for ineffective assistance of trial\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 17    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\ncounsel, the ineffective assistance of counsel in that initial-review collateral\nproceeding can provide cause to excuse the procedural default. Martinez, 132\nS. Ct. at 1318. In Ibarra, we reasoned that Martinez did not apply in Texas\nbecause Texas law did not require that a Texas defendant raise his ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel claim for the first time in a collateral proceeding.\nIbarra, 687 F.3d at 227. But in Trevino, the Supreme Court explained that\nMartinez applies in Texas because the “state procedural framework, by reason\nof its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a\ndefendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel on direct appeal.” Trevino, 133 S. Ct. at 1921. Thus,\nin light of Trevino, there is a proving cause for procedural default that was not\navailable when Canales was before the district court.\n      In order to establish cause to excuse his procedural default, Canales\nmust prove that his counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding was\ndeficient; that is, he must show that the representation of his initial-review\ncollateral proceeding “fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” See\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984); see also Martinez, 132 S.\nCt. at 1318 (citing Strickland as the appropriate standard for judging whether\nstate habeas counsel was ineffective). As part of establishing cause, Canales\nmust also show that “the underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim is a substantial one, which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate\nthat the claim has some merit.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1318 (citing Miller-El\nv. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322 (2003)).\n      To excuse the procedural default fully, Canales would then be required\nto prove that he suffered prejudice from the ineffective assistance of his trial\ncounsel. See Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1321 (remanding to the court of appeals\nto “address the question of prejudice”). Prejudice requires a showing that there\nis “a reasonable probability that, but for [trial] counsel’s unprofessional errors,\n                                        17\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 18   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.           A reasonable\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694; see also Sells v. Stephens, 536 F. App’x 483, 493\n(5th Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (“In order to satisfy the performance prong, Sells\nmust show that both his trial and habeas counsels’ representation fell below\nan ‘objective standard of reasonableness.’ Under the second prong, Sells must\nshow that there is ‘a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the\nsentence . . . would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” (citations omitted)).\n      We look first at Canales’s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective\nduring the guilt phase of his trial. Canales first argues that his trial counsel\nfailed to impeach witnesses effectively.    Second, Canales claims his trial\ncounsel was ineffective in affirmatively aiding the State in proving part of his\nmurder charge. Canales was charged under Texas Penal Code § 19.03(a)(5)(B)\n“which makes it a capital offense for a person to knowingly or intentionally\nmurder another person, while incarcerated in a penal institution, with the\nintent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination or in the profits\nof a combination.” Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 692–93. He argues that his trial\ncounsel essentially conceded the combination element when they tried to\ninculpate Whited, who was a member of the Texas Mafia, in the murder.\n      The problem is that Canales has not established cause for the procedural\ndefault of his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during the guilt\nphase because the claim is not substantial. Though Canales argues his trial\ncounsel should have impeached witnesses more effectively, our review of the\nrecord shows that the jury actually heard testimony regarding the witnesses’\ninconsistent statements, racism, and potential bias against Canales—the\nevidence that he claims his trial counsel should have used for impeachment.\nIn addition, there was other evidence—aside from testimony tying Whited to\n                                      18\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 19   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthe murder—that proved the combination element. The state put forward\nevidence of Canales’s membership in the Texas Mafia that proved the\ncombination element of the crime even without any inculpating Whited in the\nmurder. See Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 697. Thus, because Canales’s claim of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel during the guilt phase of his trial lacks\nmerit, he cannot prove cause to excuse the procedural default.\n      We turn next to Canales’s claim that he received ineffective assistance\nof trial counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. Canales argues his\ntrial counsel was ineffective because he failed to thoroughly investigate and\npresent mitigation evidence. He also argues that the performance of his state\nhabeas counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Canales’s\nstate habeas counsel did not conduct a mitigation investigation due to a\nmisunderstanding of funding for habeas investigations: his state habeas\ncounsel thought his funding was capped at $25,000, and so he only dedicated\n$2,500 to investigation—and most of that went to issues related to innocence.\nBoth parties agree, however, that funding was not capped at $25,000.\n      First, we agree with Canales that the performance of his state habeas\ncounsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. The Supreme Court\nrecently considered a similar situation in which trial attorney failed to request\nadditional funding to replace an inadequate expert because of a mistaken belief\nabout the amount of funding available. Hinton v. Alabama, 134 S. Ct. 1081,\n1088 (2014) (per curiam). The Court held that the trial lawyer’s decisions\n“based not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available\nfunding was capped [at a certain amount]” constituted deficient performance.\nHinton, 134 S. Ct. at 1088–89. Similarly, Canales’s state habeas counsel did\nnot make a strategic choice to forego a mitigation investigation. Instead, he\nchose not to pursue that claim in any depth because he thought he could not\n\n\n                                       19\n\f    Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279    Page: 20   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nreceive any additional funding to pursue those claims.         Accordingly, his\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n      Because Canales has established that his state habeas counsel’s\nbehavior was deficient, we now consider whether there is some merit to his\nclaim that his trial counsel were ineffective at sentencing. By Canales’s trial\ncounsel’s own admission, they did not conduct any mitigation investigation. A\ndeclaration from his trial counsel shows that trial counsel did not hire a\nmitigation specialist, interview family members or others who knew him\ngrowing up, or “collect any records or any historical data on his life.” During\nsentencing, the only mitigation evidence his counsel presented was that he was\n“a gifted artist” and “a peacemaker in prison.” Even the prosecutor noticed the\ndearth of any mitigating evidence, stating “it’s an incredibly sad tribute that\nwhen a man’s life is on the line about the only good thing we can say about him\nis that he’s a good artist.”\n      If Canales’s trial attorneys had conducted a mitigation investigation,\nthey would have discovered an extensive history of physical abuse, emotional\nabuse, and neglect. Canales’s mother was an alcoholic who neglected her\nchildren, and his father was violent, angry, and irrational. After Canales’s\nparents separated, his mother married a man who was physically abusive,\nbeating Canales with a belt and fist and forcing him to strip naked prior to\nthese beatings. Canales’s step-father sexually abused his sister, and Canales\nattempted, in vain, to protect her. The family lived in poor housing, infested\nwith flea and lice and located in “gang central.” Canales’s grandparents were\nalso physically and verbally abusive. Eventually, Canales’s mother left him\nwith his father. The beatings then resumed, and Canales’s father would beat\nhim “until his father got tired.” This led Canales to abuse drugs and alcohol,\n“hook[] up with the wrong people,” and begin committing crimes. He lived in\nhalf-way houses for part of his teenage years. Canales’s sister stated that the\n                                      20\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 21   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\ndeath of Canales’s mother impacted Canales severely and that he “went off the\ndeep end” after she passed away.\n      Based on these facts, we hold that Canales’s ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel claim has some merit. First, we conclude that Canales’s trial counsel’s\nperformance was deficient during the sentencing phase. A decision not to\ninvestigate “must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the\ncircumstances.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 533 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n691). Considering all of the circumstances here, Canales’s trial attorneys’\nperformance was not reasonable. His trial counsel did not make a reasoned\ndecision not to conduct a mitigation investigation. Cf. Wood v. Allen, 558 U.S.\n290, 301–03 (2010) (denying habeas relief and noting that “counsel’s failure to\npursue or present evidence of [the defendant’s] mental deficiencies was not\nmere oversight or neglect but instead the result of a deliberate decision to focus\non other defenses”). His trial counsel’s failure to consider mitigation evidence\nhad nothing to do with Canales or any attempt on his part to obstruct his trial\ncounsel in pursuing an investigation into mitigating evidence.          Compare\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 478–81 (2007) (state court did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland in denying habeas relief where the defendant\nrefused to allow his counsel to present mitigating evidence from his family and\nthe only other mitigating evidence was that the defendant may have a genetic\npredisposition to violence), with Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 381 (2005)\n(state court unreasonably applied Strickland in denying habeas relief where\ndefendant was merely “uninterested in helping” and other mitigating evidence\nincluded school records and records of prior incarcerations). Simply put, his\ncounsel’s failure to do any investigating “resulted from inattention, not\nreasoned strategic judgment.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 256.\n      Second, Canales has shown that there is some merit to the claim that he\nwas prejudiced by his trial counsel’s deficient behavior during sentencing. The\n                                       21\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 22   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nonly mitigation evidence put forward during sentencing was that Canales was\na gifted artist and a peacemaker in prison. The jury did not hear any evidence\nregarding Canales’s childhood, which was full of violence and privation. While\nthere was certainly evidence to support a finding of future dangerousness, we\nare not convinced that evidence is enough to say that Canales’s claim is not\nsubstantial. We are persuaded that the Supreme Court’s decisions in Williams\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), and Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374 (2005)\nshow that Canales’s claim has, at the very least, some merit. See Rompilla,\n545 U.S. at 390–93 (state court decision denying habeas relief was\nunreasonable where additional mitigation investigation regarding the\ndefendant’s abusive, impoverished childhood and alcohol-related causes of the\ndefendant’s juvenile incarcerations might have influenced the jury’s evaluation\nof culpability); Williams, 529 U.S. at 398–99 (state court decision denying\nhabeas relief was unreasonable where new mitigation evidence, including “the\ngraphic description of [the defendant’s] childhood, filled with abuse and\nprivation, or the reality that he was ‘borderline mentally retarded,’ might well\nhave influenced the jury’s appraisal of his moral culpability” despite the\n“strength of the prosecution evidence supporting the future dangerous\naggravating circumstance”). Given all this, there is some merit to the notion\nthat, had trial counsel’s performance not been deficient during sentencing, “at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S.\nat 537. Thus, we conclude that Canales’s claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel during sentencing is substantial.\n      The question then becomes whether Canales can actually prove prejudice\ndue to the deficient performance of his habeas counsel. Claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel present a mixed question of law and fact.         Lamb v.\nJohnson, 179 F.3d 352, 356 (5th Cir. 1999). And, as the Supreme Court has\nexplained, “the district court is better positioned” than appellate courts to\n                                       22\n\f    Case: 12-70034       Document: 00512752279          Page: 23     Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-70034\naddress mixed questions of law. See Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1932\n(2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The district court,\nthough, has not yet addressed Canales’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nbecause its order was issued before Trevino. Moreover, Canales has not yet\nhad the chance to develop the factual basis for this claim because, until\nTrevino, it was procedurally defaulted. While there is sufficient information\nbefore this Court for us to conclude that there is some merit to Canales’s claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel, we think the district court should address\nthe prejudice question in the first instance. Our recent post-Trevino decisions\nsupport this decision. In cases where the district court made its decision before\nTrevino and the district court did not make an alternative merits\ndetermination, we have remanded the case to the district court. See Balentine\nv. Stephens, 553 F. App’x 424, 425 (5th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (unpublished);\nTrevino v. Stephens, 740 F.3d 379 (5th Cir. 2014) (per curiam).\n       Thus, we hold that Canales has established cause to excuse the\nprocedural default of his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at\nsentencing. We remand this claim for the district court to consider whether\nCanales can prove prejudice as a result of his trial counsel’s deficient\nperformance, and if so, to address the merits of his habeas petition on this\nclaim. 2\n       2. Use of State Agent to Solicit Incriminating Evidence (Massiah Claim)\n       Canales argues that Texas used Innes as a state agent to solicit\nincriminating evidence from him after he was indicted in violation of his Sixth\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights. An individual’s Sixth Amendment rights\n\n\n\n       2  Texas argues that if we decide to remand any claims to the district court, we should\ndeny Canales the opportunity to have an evidentiary hearing. We decline to take this step,\nand we leave the determination of whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate to the\ndistrict court.\n                                             23\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279     Page: 24   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                No. 12-70034\nhave been violated when the state is allowed to use “against him at his trial\nevidence from his own incriminating words, which [state] agents had\ndeliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of\nhis counsel.” Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964). A Massiah\nviolation has three elements: “(1) the Sixth Amendment right to counsel has\nattached; (2) the individual seeking information from the defendant is a\ngovernment agent acting without the defendant’s counsel’s being present; and\n(3) that agent ‘deliberately elicit[s]’ incriminating statements from the\ndefendant.” Henderson v. Quarterman, 460 F.3d 654, 664 (5th Cir. 2006). The\nright to counsel attaches when the defendant is indicted. See Patterson v.\nIllinois, 487 U.S. 285, 290–91 (1988). A Massiah violation can occur when the\ngovernment agent is an undisclosed government informant. See United States\nv. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 269–74 (1980).\n      Canales argues he can establish both cause and prejudice. The dispute\nhere focuses on the February 2000 letter, which Canales wrote to Innes. In the\nletter, Canales appears to ask the gang to retaliate against Larry Whited\nbecause Canales believed Whited had turned him in for his role in Dickerson’s\nkilling. Canales argues that Innes was already working for the state by the\ntime Canales was indicted in November 1999.        He also claims the Texas\nencouraged Innes to elicit inculpatory information from him. Canales further\nclaims that Texas suppressed the information that Innes was working as a\nstate agent. Thus, Canales claims he can show cause for the procedural default\nbecause state officials prevented him from learning this information.\n      Canales also argues that this had a substantial and injurious effect on\nhis trial and his sentence. He claims the February 2000 letter was necessary\nto introduce the 1998 confessional letter. Canales explains the February 2000\nletter was matched to him through his fingerprint. He argues the prosecution\nused that fingerprint to admit the 1998 confessional letter. He then claims\n                                      24\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 25   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthat without the 1998 confessional letter, the state would only have had the\ntestimony of unreliable inmate witnesses.       Moreover, he argues that the\nprosecution used the February 2000 letter as evidence of his future\ndangerousness, which it needed for Canales to receive the death penalty. Thus,\nhe claims he has shown actual prejudice.\n      Even if Canales could establish cause, we hold he cannot prove actual\nprejudice based on these alleged violations. Looking at the guilt phase of the\ntrial, Canales’s primary argument is that, without the February 2000 letter,\nTexas could not have admitted the 1998 confessional letter.             But the\nprosecution relied on more than fingerprint evidence to authenticate the 1998\nconfessional letter: the State also offered testimony matching the letter to\nCanales’s handwriting.     Though Canales disparages this as lay-witness\ntestimony, he does not argue that it would have been insufficient to admit the\n1998 letter. Further, under the Texas Rules of Evidence, nonexpert opinion on\nhandwriting can be used to authenticate and identify documents. Tex. R. Evid.\n901. Thus, the confessional letter could have been admitted even without the\nFebruary 2000 letter.\n      Turning next to sentencing, the state did not rely solely on the February\n2000 letter to prove future dangerousness. Cf. Westbrook v. Thaler, 585 F.3d\n245, 256 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that the alleged Massiah violation in\nmistakenly admitting evidence that the defendant solicited the murder of three\npeople did not have a substantial and injurious effect on sentencing in light of\nevidence that the defendant had murdered five people and solicited murders of\ntwo others). The jury had the April 2000 letter, wherein Canales threatened\ninformants. The jury had evidence that Canales was part of a gang, and that\nCanales had committed murder in connection with his prison gang (because\nthe jury had convicted him based on the combination element). The jury also\nknew that Canales was in prison serving a fifteen-year sentence for aggravated\n                                      25\n\f    Case: 12-70034       Document: 00512752279        Page: 26     Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-70034\nsexual assault and that he had already served a five-year sentence on an\nearlier sexual assault. Thus, Canales has not proven that the alleged Massiah\nviolation had a substantial and injurious effect on his trial. 3\n       3. Failure to Correct False Testimony (Giglio/Napue Claim)\n       Canales next argues that the state solicited false testimony from Innes,\nor at least, allowed testimony the State knew was false to go uncorrected. The\nSupreme Court has repeatedly held that “a conviction obtained through false\nevidence, known to be such by representatives of the State” violates a\ndefendant’s constitutional rights. See Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 7 (1967) (citing\ncases). A violation occurs where there is a “deliberate deception of court and\njury by the presentation of testimony known to be perjured.”                   Mooney v.\nHolohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935). “The same result obtains when the State,\nalthough not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it\nappears.” Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959). To obtain relief, Canales\nmust show “1) the testimony was actually false, 2) the state knew it was false,\nand 3) the testimony was material.” Pyles v. Johnson, 136 F.3d 986, 996 (5th\nCir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The testimony is\nmaterial if “there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could\nhave affected the judgment of the jury.” United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97,\n103 (1976) (citing Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972)).\n\n\n\n       3 Texas suggests that the district court improperly reached the merits of Canales’s\nMassiah claim. The magistrate judge’s report and recommendations indicates that the\nmagistrate judge reached the merits, but the district court made some modifications when it\naccepted the proposed findings and recommendations. Specifically, the district court stated\nthat it had determined “that the admission of the [February 2000] letter did not have a\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.” The district\ncourt’s language mirrors language the Supreme Court has used to define prejudice. See\nFrady, 456 U.S. at 170 (explaining proving actual prejudice means the petitioner must prove\nthat the errors “worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage”). Thus, we agree with\nthe district court’s decision to deny Canales’s Massiah claim because it was procedurally\ndefaulted and conclude he did not prove actual prejudice.\n                                            26\n\f    Case: 12-70034      Document: 00512752279        Page: 27     Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-70034\n      Neither party disputes that Canales can establish cause for procedurally\ndefaulting this claim, but the parties disagree over whether the testimony was\nfalse and whether it was material. Canales argues Innes gave false testimony\nabout the 1998 confessional letter. Canales says Innes testified he asked\nCanales to write him a letter describing Dickerson’s murder, and he watched\nCanales tie the kite 4 on a string that Innes pulled into his cell. But Canales\nsays a prison official’s handwritten notes from a meeting with Innes show that\nanother inmate received the letter from Canales. 5 Canales argues that the\nstate had access to the prison official’s notes, and so the state knew Innes’s\ntrial testimony was false. Further, he argues it was material because Innes’s\ncredibility was important, and knowing this false testimony would have given\na different picture of the state’s case.\n      We disagree and hold that the district court was correct to deny this\nclaim. First, Canales has not established that Innes’s testimony was false or\nthat the State knew that it was false. The prison official’s handwritten notes\nare not dated; they do not say whose comments were being recorded; and they\ndo not mention Innes at all. As the district court concluded, it is far from clear\nthat the notes even refer to Innes. Moreover, while Innes was an important\nwitness, the interview notes do not directly contradict his testimony. The notes\ndo not state that Innes was the subject of the interview; if the notes were from\n\n\n      4 According to trial testimony, a kite is a handwritten note that is written between\ninmates.\n      5 According to both parties, the notes stated in full:\n\n             written by Canales\n             Another inmate has the letter - he’s not involved @\n             all – will have to get the letter from him\n             Another inmate rec the letter from Canales\n             This inmate sent me the letter to see it\n             The letter is step for step how the letter [sic]\n             went down.\n             The letter is in Canales’ handwriting\n\n                                           27\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 28   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nan interview with someone else, Innes could be the other inmate referenced in\nthe interview notes who received Canales’s letter. Cf. United States v. Fisher,\n106 F.3d 622, 634–35 (5th Cir. 1997) (finding Brady violation where the false\ntestimony was “directly contradictory”), abrogated on other grounds by Ohler\nv. United States, 529 U.S. 753 (2000).\n      Moreover, even if the testimony was false, Canales has not established\nthat the testimony was material. While the confessional letter itself was very\nimportant to the prosecution’s case, the allegedly false testimony only served\nto explain how Innes received the letter, not to the substance of the letter. So,\neven if the false testimony might have made the jury question Innes’s\ncredibility, it would not have changed the fact that the letter was signed by\nCanales, written in Canales’s handwriting, and described Dickerson’s murder.\nThus, we cannot say that there is a reasonable likelihood that the false\ntestimony affected the judgment of the jury, and so the district court correctly\ndenied Canales’s false testimony claim.\n      4. Failure to Disclose Impeachment Evidence (Brady Claim)\n      Canales argues that Texas suppressed several pieces of impeachment\nevidence in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In Brady\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the Supreme Court held that “the suppression\nby the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates\ndue process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\nirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Id. at 87. “There\nare three components of a true Brady violation”: (1) the evidence at issue,\nwhether exculpatory or impeaching, must be favorable to the accused; (2) “that\nevidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or\ninadvertently”; and (3) “prejudice must have ensued.” Strickler v. Greene, 527\nU.S. 263, 281–82 (1999).\n\n\n                                         28\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 29   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\n      Evidence is material for purposes of Brady “if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different,” meaning the probability is\n“sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” United States v. Bagley,\n473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). To evaluate\nmateriality, courts should not simply ask whether, “after discounting the\ninculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, the remaining\nevidence is sufficient to support the jury’s conclusions.” Strickler, 527 U.S. at\n290. Instead, the proper inquiry is whether “the favorable evidence could\nreasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\nundermine confidence in the verdict.” Id. The materiality of the suppressed\nevidence should be assessed collectively. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 436\n(1995).   The prejudice component is the same as materiality for Brady\npurposes. Banks v. Dretke, 540 U.S. 668, 691 (2004) (“[C]oincident with the\nthird Brady component (prejudice), prejudice within the compass of the ‘cause\nand prejudice’ requirement exists when the suppressed evidence is ‘material’\nfor Brady purposes.”).\n      Though neither party disputes that Canales can demonstrate cause for\nhis procedural default, they disagree about whether Canales can prove\nprejudice. Canales argues the state suppressed five pieces of impeachment\nevidence. First, Innes was also a suspect in Dickerson’s murder. Second, Innes\nhad a weapon-possession charge dismissed as in exchange for testifying.\nThird, the State assisted inmate witnesses with issues concerning housing,\nprison conditions, and parole. Fourth, the State encouraged Innes and Whited\nto communicate with each other before trial. Fifth, Innes continued in prison\ngang activities after renouncing his membership. Canales claims that witness\ncredibility was an important issue in the case, and that looking at the\n\n\n                                       29\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 30   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\ncumulative impact of this evidence, there is a reasonable probability the\noutcome would have been different.\n      We hold that Canales has not demonstrated actual prejudice that would\nexcuse the procedural default. Turning first to Canales’s claim that the State\nassisted prisoners who testified against him, the record shows that the jury\nheard at least some of this information at trial. Canales’s attorneys at least\nasked some inmate–witnesses about being encouraged to help the State in\nexchange for benefits, such as help with their cases and being moved to a\ndifferent prison. “The materiality of Brady material depends almost entirely\non the value of the evidence relative to the other evidence mustered by the\nstate.” Rocha v. Thaler (Rocha I), 619 F.3d 387, 396 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting\nUnited States v. Sipe, 388 F.3d 471, 478 (5th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Our Court has granted habeas relief based on Brady claims\nwhen the impeachment evidence that was withheld was the only direct\nevidence linking the defendant to the crime. See LaCaze v. Warden La. Corr.\nInst. for Women, 645 F.3d 728, 738 (5th Cir. 2011); Tassin v. Cain, 517 F.3d\n770, 779–81 (5th Cir. 2008). We have also considered it important if the\nprosecutor told the jury that the witnesses had no reason to lie. LaCaze, 645\nF.3d at 738; Tassin, 517 F.3d at 781. Neither of those circumstances is present\nhere. In this case, the witness testimony was not the only evidence linking the\ndefendant to the crime; the jury had Canales’s letter describing Dickerson’s\nmurder. In addition, the prosecutor raised the issue of the inmate–witness’s\ncredibility, telling the jury that reliance on inmate testimony was a “legitimate\nconcern,” that “inmates lie,” and stating “I would be an utter fool to stand here\nand try to convince you to believe everything our witnesses told you.”\n      Turning next to Canales’s claims about the information that was\nallegedly withheld about Innes, we note that Canales’s attorney questioned\nInnes about the deal he received in exchange for his testimony. The jury heard\n                                       30\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 31   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthat Innes had a pending weapon charge that, combined with his two prior\nconvictions, could have resulted in a 99-year sentence, but that Innes only\nreceived two three-year sentences to run concurrently.\n      While the allegation that the State suppressed the fact that Innes was a\nsuspect is more serious, that does not change our conclusion. This Court and\nother courts have sometimes held that withholding evidence of another suspect\nwas a Brady violation, particularly when the other evidence linking the\ndefendant to the crime was limited. See, e.g., Graves v. Dretke, 442 F.3d 334,\n343–44 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding a Brady violation where, had the defense\nknown about the other suspect, the defense could have “persuasively argued”\nthat the other suspect had committed the murder and the evidence at trial\nrested “almost entirely on [the other suspect’s] testimony”); Bowen v. Maynard,\n799 F.2d 593, 610–13 (10th Cir. 1986) (holding there was a Brady violation\nwhen the “only identification evidence against the defendant was significantly\nimpeachable” with the evidence of the other suspect that was withheld). But\nthere is not a Brady violation every time the government does not disclose an\nalternative suspect, especially when the other suspect was not a particularly\nplausible one. See, e.g., Spence v. Johnson, 80 F.3d 989, 998–99 (5th Cir. 1996)\n(holding there was no Brady violation when, even if the defense counsel had\nhad information about the other suspect at trial, the prosecution would have\nbeen able to “exonerate[e]” the other suspect with other facts).\n      Here, unlike in Graves and Bowen, there was still other evidence besides\nInnes’s testimony at trial that would have supported the verdict, namely the\n1998 confessional letter describing the murder step-by-step. Given this, and\nconsidering the materiality of the Brady material relative to the other evidence\nat trial, there is not a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been\n\n\n\n\n                                      31\n\f    Case: 12-70034        Document: 00512752279           Page: 32      Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-70034\nchanged if Canales had known this information.                    Thus, the district court\ncorrectly denied Canales habeas petition on these claims. 6\n       5. Trial Court Rulings, Cumulative Effect, and Jury Claims\n       Canales also argues that (1) the trial court’s rulings violated his right to\npresent a defense; (2) the cumulative effect of his ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and the withholding of evidence violated his right to due process; and\n(3) his Sixth, Eight, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated because\nseveral jurors lied about their criminal background.                       Canales did not\nseparately brief these claims, instead relying on another portion of his brief in\nwhich he argued that the state court’s ruling was not based on independent\nand adequate state grounds. While that portion of the brief attempted to\nestablish cause for the procedural default of these claims, Canales never\nargued that these alleged constitutional violations resulted in actual prejudice.\n“It is a well worn principle that the failure to raise an issue on appeal\nconstitutes waiver of that argument.” See United States v. Griffith, 522 F.3d\n607, 610 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing United States v. Thibodeaux, 211 F.3d 910,\n912(5th Cir. 2000). Because Canales has waived any argument that he can\nestablish prejudice that would excuse his procedural default, we will not\naddress these issues on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       6  As it did with the Massiah claim, Texas again argues that the district court\nimproperly reached the merits of this claim. In its order denying Canales’s petition, the\ndistrict court explained that the standard for the prejudice element of cause and prejudice\nand the standard for materiality under Brady are the same. The district court then stated,\n“Because the Court accepts the Magistrate Judge’s proposed finding of no prejudice, it would\nbe equally correct to characterize the disposition of this claim as a dismissal under the\ndoctrine of procedural default or as a denial of the substantive claim on the merits.” Texas\nargues that was error, because a federal court should not reach the merits of a claim that has\nbeen procedurally defaulted unless the petitioner can prove cause and prejudice. We agree,\nand so in affirming the district court’s decision, we clarify that our holding rests on procedural\ndefault without reaching the merits of Canales’s claim.\n\n                                               32\n\f   Case: 12-70034       Document: 00512752279    Page: 33   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\n      6. Shackling Claim\n      Canales argues that his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights\nwere violated when he was shackled during the sentencing phase of his trial.\nThe district court reached the merits of this claim, because it found Canales\nhad presented it both in his direct appeal and in his first state habeas petition,\nand the state court adjudicated this claim on the merits. On appeal, however,\nTexas argues Canales did not present his claim in state court, and so it is\nprocedurally defaulted.\n      We agree with Texas that Canales did not fairly present his shackling\nclaim in state court.     “The exhaustion requirement is satisfied when the\nsubstance of the federal habeas claim has been fairly presented to the highest\nstate court.” Whithead v. Johnson, 157 F3d 384, 387 (5th Cir. 1998). For a\nclaim to have been fairly presented, the state court must “be alerted to the fact\nthat the prisoners are asserting claims under the United States Constitution.”\nDuncan v Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 365–66 (1995) (per curiam). Vague or fleeting\nreferences to principles of constitutional law are not enough, see Wilder v.\nCockrell, 274 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir. 2001), nor will the fact that the petitioner\nmade a “somewhat similar state-law claim” suffice, see Anderson v. Harless,\n459 U.S. 4, 6 (1982).\n      The Supreme Court has required a petitioner to be clear that he is\nmaking a constitutional argument in his state habeas petition before\nconcluding that the constitutional claim was “fairly presented.” In Picard v.\nConnor, 404 U.S. 270 (1971), the habeas petitioner had argued that his\nindictment was improper under state law and had also obliquely referenced\ndue process before the state’s highest court. See id. at 277. But the federal\nappellate court had found the habeas petitioner’s rights under the Equal\nProtection Clause had been violated. Id. The Court disagreed that the state\ncourt had had an opportunity to rule on his constitutional claim. Id. It “[could\n                                       33\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 34   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nnot] fault [the state court] for failing also to consider sua sponte whether the\nindictment procedure denied respondent equal protection of the laws.” Id.; see\nalso Duncan, 513 U.S. at 366.\n      After reviewing Canales’s first state habeas petition, we conclude that\nCanales did not “fairly present” his constitutional claim in his first state\nhabeas petition. Canales relied primarily on Texas state court cases, arguing\nthat his shackling was improper under Gammage v. State, 630 S.W.2d 309\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 1982, pet. ref’d.). While Canales quoted from Illinois\nv. Allen, 397 U.S. 337 (1970), which established that unnecessary shackling\nduring trial was a violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights, and noted\nthat Gammage cited Allen, Canales did not cite Allen for its constitutional\nholding. Rather, he only argued that the trial court “abused its discretion and\nunfairly prejudiced” him when it allowed him to be shackled during the\npunishment phase of his trial. The state trial court’s ruling on the shackling\nclaim, which the CCA adopted, makes no indication that the court saw this\nissue as a constitutional one. “[A] claim for relief in habeas corpus must\ninclude reference to a specific federal constitutional guarantee, as well as a\nstatement of the facts which entitle the petitioner to relief.”         Gray v.\nNetherland, 518 U.S. 152, 162–63 (1996). Because it does not appear that\nCanales’s shackling claim was fairly presented in his first state habeas\npetition, we hold that this claim was procedurally defaulted.\n      Next, we consider whether Canales has established cause and prejudice\nto excuse the procedural default.      But Canales does not argue cause or\nprejudice; instead, he only argues that the state court reached the merits of\nthis claim during his first habeas petition and that it warrants relief. When\nhe filed his reply brief, Canales was on notice that Texas had argued that his\nshackling claim had not been fairly presented to the state court in his first\nhabeas petition. He knew, too, that if we held that his claim had not been fairly\n                                       34\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 35   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                No. 12-70034\npresented in his first habeas petition and was instead procedurally defaulted,\nhe would need to argue he could overcome that by showing cause and prejudice.\nCanales, though, did not address these arguments at all in his reply brief.\nThus, his shackling claim was inadequately briefed and abandoned, and we\nwill not reach it on appeal. See United States v. Cothran, 302 F.3d 279, 286\nn.7 (5th Cir. 2002) (arguments not adequately briefed were considered\nabandoned).\n                            IV. CONCLUSION\n     We REVERSE the district court’s dismissal of Canales’s claim that he\nreceived ineffective assistance of trial counsel during sentencing, and we\nREMAND for the district court to consider whether Canales can prove\nprejudice. As to all other claims, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                     35\n\f",

(Giglio/Napue Claim and Brady Claim)\n         5.

The jury communicated with the court and with the bailiff\n            outside his and his counsel’s presence during deliberations,\n            which violated his rights to due process of law, fair trial, and\n            to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\n         8. Canales was shackled during the punishment phase of his\n            trial in violation of his rights to due process of law, to remain\n            silent, and to a fair trial.\n      For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court on Canales’s\nclaim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing, and\nwe remand that issue to the district court. We affirm the district court on all\nother claims.\n\n                                        2\n\f     Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279     Page: 3   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.     Factual Background\n       On July 1, 1997, prison officials caught Larry “Dirty” Dickerson\n(“Dickerson), an inmate at the Telford Unit of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice (“the Unit”), with contraband that belonged to another prison\ngang. Dickerson told another inmate, James Baker (“Baker”), that if Baker\ndid not help him avoid retaliation from the gang whose contraband was stolen,\nDickerson would tell prison officials about a large quantity of tobacco that was\nto be smuggled into the prison the next day.\n       The next day, prison officials intercepted a shipment of contraband\ntobacco intended for Baker and the Texas Mafia, a prison gang. When the\ntobacco was intercepted, Dickerson was placed in administrative segregation.\nAt his own request, he returned to the general population about a week later.\nDickerson was found dead in his cell on July 11, 1997. Prison authorities\ninitially concluded that Dickerson had died of natural causes. Only after\nconducting an autopsy did the State conclude that Dickerson had actually been\nstrangled.\n       The Texas Mafia had a financial stake in the intercepted contraband\ntobacco and arranged for Dickerson’s murder. See Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 693.\nCanales, who was also an inmate in the Unit, was a member of the Texas\nMafia. According to the magistrate judge’s summary of the facts Canales and\nthree other Texas Mafia members—William Speer (“Speer”), Jessie Barnes,\nand Michael Constantine—agreed to murder Dickerson. Canales and Speer\nwent to Dickerson’s cell, and while Canales held him down, Speer strangled\nhim.\n       In 1998, Canales sent a letter to Bruce Innes (“Innes”) in which he\ndescribed Dickerson’s murder and the Texas Mafia’s interest in it. The letter\nwas admitted into evidence at trial.\n                                       3\n\f    Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 4   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\n      Dirty [Dickerson] lit the smoke and we smoked. When the last hit\n      was took he was down by the vent on his knee and Puff [Speer]\n      behind and me at the door. Puff put the hold on him and I grabbed\n      his arms. It went smooth! He lost consciousness right away and\n      strugled (sic) for a little bit. I took the time to inform Him who we\n      were and why he’s going to die. Puff told him . . “Don’t even fuck\n      with the Texas-MAFIA in hell!!” Ha! Ha! Ha! Anyway. . . we made\n      sure the dick sucker was dead and I declared the hit complete. We\n      put his shit smelling ass in the top bunk and went quietly out the\n      door. I went to the yard with minutes to spare!!\nR. at 2355 (magistrate judge’s summary of the facts) (alterations in original)\n(emphasis omitted).\n      Canales was indicted for capital murder in November 1999. In February\n2000, he sent another letter to Innes. As the district court described the letter,\n“although written in code, [it] appeared to ask the gang to retaliate against\nLarry (“Iron-head”) Whited because he believed Whited had informed prison\nauthorities about his role in the killing.” The district court also included the\nletter:\n      Greetings, Sir . . As always, I come to you and all worthy with my\n      utmost respects (sic)! I realize that I just recently sent you a letter\n      but it has become imperative that I write you again, as you’ll see\n      . . First, I arrived at bowie county court on 2-7-00 and was\n      arraigned for several charges.            Mr.s Speers barnes and\n      Constinetine were also there. . I must tell you that the worst has\n      been done and its (sic) one of the charges (Main one actually)\n      Glarinly (sic) absent was that iron headed fella . . He was not\n      charged, which is good .. Eh? Seems that iron obes (sic) bend to\n      the will of the state or not. I personally think so.\n      Perhaps some effort can be used to throw that useless material to\n      the scrap yard. . I can’t stress how important this is. As you know\n      Iron can be shaped into what you want it to look like and not in a\n      good way sir!! If this can’t be done then I’ll need to ask for legal-\n      assistance from other arenas .. And that’s not to(sic) cool!\n      Maximum effort Ace, Maximum!! Now, I will also get with Mr. JR\n      on the others who are involved and can help get it all in order.\n      Also, it’s possible that a legal defense fund will be placed to help\n\n                                        4\n\f     Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 5    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-70034\n       with council, (sic) legal material, clothes (for court) I’ll have our\n       attorney (who’s a freeworld) get it together and put out flyers to all\n       the best.\n       We’ll need ya’lls (sic) help fellas and I can’t stress how important\n       it is to file that writ of dismissal in this area on that pile of scrap!\n       This in itself would be tremendous in assisting this legal case!\n       That’s how important it is . . .

We continue\n       the struggle,\n       In solidarity\n       Bigfoot..\nR. at 2356–57 (emphasis omitted). This letter was also admitted into evidence\nat trial.\n       In April 2000, Canales wrote a third letter to another inmate, which read\nin part:\n       Yeah bubba, I’ve been bummed a bit, just a small funk, no sweat ..\n       A lot has to do with my case and its outcome or the way I see it.\n       It’s not good , and I’ve got a few making matters worse with their\n       mouths!

I saw the downfall and how it came about and who was\n       responsible! I’ve got snakes in the yard and it’s getting worse from\n       the crap coming outta the mouths of so-called homies.

And that what you\n       sow, you reap! So, I’ll be content with justice in the end. TDC is\n       not big, at all! So ......\nR. at 2357. The State also introduced this letter into evidence at trial.\n       The 1998 letter was particularly important in the guilt phase, and the\nother two letters were used at punishment phase to help establish “future\ndangerousness,” the special issue that led to his capital sentence. Canales, 98\nS.W.3d at 699. The State also used several inmates as witnesses, including\n\n                                          5\n\f     Case: 12-70034        Document: 00512752279          Page: 6     Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-70034\nInnes (who allegedly started working as a State agent in 1999 or 2000), Richard\nDriver, Jr., and Doyle Hill.\nB.    Procedural Background\n      Canales was convicted of capital murder in state district court, and based\non the jury’s answers to special issues under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure\narticle 37.071, the court sentenced him to death.                   The CCA affirmed his\nsentence on direct appeal. Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 700. Canales also filed a\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court, presenting ninety-seven\nissues for review; the CCA denied his petition. Ex parte Canales, No. 54,789-\n01 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr. 5, 2003).\n      In 2004, Canales filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal\ndistrict court in the Eastern District of Texas. His petition raised thirteen\nclaims, including the eight on which the district court granted a COA. Canales\nfiled a motion to stay his habeas proceedings so that he could return to state\ncourt to exhaust the new claims that he had filed based on evidence that, he\nalleged, had been suppressed. The district court granted his motion and stayed\nproceedings.\n      Canales presented his petition to the CCA, and the CCA asked for\nadditional briefing on Canales ineffective assistance claims.

The CCA dismissed his application as an abuse of the\nwrit under article 11.071, § 5(c) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. 1\n      Canales then returned to federal district court.                   The district court\ngranted discovery, allowing Canales to investigate his claims of state\nmisconduct and jury irregularity.              More than three years later, Canales\nsupplemented his habeas petition with additional evidence and arguments\n\n\n      1   See infra Part III(B) for a more detailed discussion of the CCA’s ruling.\n                                               6\n\f     Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 7    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nregarding the evidence the State allegedly withheld. The case was referred to\na magistrate judge.      The magistrate judge recommended that Canales’s\npetition be denied because the claims were procedurally defaulted and Canales\ncould not prove cause and prejudice. The district court accepted the magistrate\njudge’s report and recommendation with slight modifications; the court chose\nnot to reach certain parts of Canales’s Massiah and Brady claims because, even\nif true, Canales could not prove prejudice. The district court granted a COA\non eight issues listed above.\n                        II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      “In an appeal of the district court’s denial of habeas relief, this court\nreviews the district court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of\nlaw de novo, applying the same standard of review that the district court\napplied to the state court decision.” Roberts v.

The standard of\nreview that we apply to each claim, however, depends on whether the claim\nhas previously been adjudicated on the merits in state court.\nA.    Independent and Adequate State Grounds\n      Federal courts lack jurisdiction to review a habeas claim “if the last state\ncourt to consider that claim expressly relied on a state ground for denial of\nrelief that is both independent of the merits of the federal claim and an\nadequate basis for the court’s decision.”      Id. at 604 (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted). So, as a general rule, “a state prisoner’s habeas\nclaims may not be entertained by a federal court when (1) a state court [has]\ndeclined to address [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a\nstate procedural requirement, and (2) the state judgment rests on independent\nand adequate state procedural grounds.” Maples v.

This means the petitioner must\nprove that the errors “worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage,\ninfecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.” Id. at 170.\nB.    AEDPA Deference\n      If, however, a state court adjudicated the claim on the merits, a different\nstandard of review applies under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”), §§ 101-108, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214\n(codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2253-2266). A federal court may\nnot grant habeas relief to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state\ncourt, unless the state court’s adjudication\n      (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n      unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n      determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 9   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\n      (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\n      determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n      State court proceeding.\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). This is also known as AEDPA deference.\n      A state court decision can be contrary to Supreme Court precedent in two\nways: (1) if “‘the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by\n[the Supreme Court] on a question of law’; or (2) ‘the state court confronts facts\nthat are materially indistinguishable from a relevant Supreme Court\nprecedent and arrives at a result opposite to [that of the Supreme Court].’”\nPippin v.

The state court’s factual findings are\npresumed to be correct unless a petitioner “rebut[s] the presumption of\ncorrectness by clear and convincing evidence.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n                              III. DISCUSSION\n      Our discussion proceeds in three parts.         First we address Texas’s\nargument that the COA is invalid for several of Canales’s claims. Next, we\ndetermine whether the CCA’s dismissal of Canales’s petition for a writ of\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f     Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279     Page: 10    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nhabeas corpus was based on independent and adequate state grounds. Then,\nwe turn to the eight claims on which the district court granted Canales a COA.\nA.     Validity of the COA\n       “Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an\nappeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas\ncorpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process\nissued by a State court.”       28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(A).      “A certificate of\nappealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a\nsubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” Id. § 2253(c)(2).\nThe COA “shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing\nrequired” in § 2253(c)(2). Id. § 2253(c)(3).\n       Texas argues that the COA is invalid as to Canales’s ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims, his claim that the trial court rulings deprived him\nof his right to present a defense, his cumulative impact claim, and his jury\nclaims. As Texas points out, if the district court denies a habeas petition on\nprocedural grounds, a COA should only issue if “the prisoner shows, at least,\nthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid\nclaim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would\nfind it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural\nruling.” See Slack v. McDaniel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118359\"><a href=\"/opinion/118359/slack-v-mcdaniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (2000) (emphasis added).\nTexas claims that the district court only found that its merits rulings were\ndebatable; the district court did not make the requisite determination that its\nprocedural rulings were debatable. Thus, according to the State, the COA is\ninvalid, and we should dismiss these five claims due to procedural default.\n       We disagree.     First, despite the seemingly mandatory language of\n§ 2253(c)(3), the failure of the COA to meet the requirements of § 2253(c)(3)\ndoes not deprive this court of jurisdiction. Gonzalez v. Thaler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620566\"><a href=\"/opinion/620566/gonzalez-v-thaler/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n652 (2012). Second, the procedural rulings in this case are complicated, and\n                                        10\n\f     Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279      Page: 11   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nthe parties devote a significant portion of their briefing to arguing about\nwhether the district court correctly determined that Canales’s claims were\nprocedurally defaulted.     Thus, even though the district court did not\nspecifically state that its procedural rulings were debatable, they are, see infra\nPart III(B), and so the district court was correct to issue the COA. Thus,\nbecause the § 2253(c)(3) requirement is not jurisdictional and the procedural\nrulings are debatable, we decline to hold that the COA is invalid.\nB.     Independent and Adequate State Grounds\n       “[W]hen . . . a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on\nfederal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy\nand independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of\nthe opinion,” the Supreme Court has directed federal courts to “accept as the\nmost reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it\ndid because it believed that federal law required it to do so.” Michigan v. Long,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111020\"><a href=\"/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1040–41 (1983). If, however, “it does not fairly appear that the\nstate court rested its decision primarily on federal grounds, it is simply not\ntrue that the ‘most reasonable explanation’ is that the state judgment rested\non federal grounds.” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 737. “This distinction matters in a\nSection 2254 proceeding because [this Court] do[es] not reach the merits when\nthe state court denied relief due to an adequate state law basis for the decision,\nindependent of the merits of the federal claim.” Balentine v. Thaler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">842</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Coleman, 501 U.S. at 729).\n       The CCA dismissed Canales’s state habeas petition as an abuse of the\nwrit, which this Court “[has] long acknowledged . . . can sometimes qualify as\nan independent and adequate state-law ground that functions as a procedural\nbar to federal-court merits review of habeas claims.” Rocha v.

Under Texas law, when a petitioner files\na subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus, a court “may not consider\n                                       11\n\f    Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 12    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nthe merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application” unless the\npetitioner shows:\n      (1) the current claims and issues have not been and could not have\n      been presented previously in a timely initial application or in a\n      previously considered application filed under this article or Article\n      11.07 because the factual or legal basis for the claim was\n      unavailable on the date the applicant filed the previous\n      application;\n      (2) by a preponderance of the evidence, but for a violation of the\n      United States Constitution no rational juror could have found the\n      applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; or\n      (3) by clear and convincing evidence, but for a violation of the\n      United States Constitution no rational juror would have answered\n      in the state’s favor one or more of the special issues that were\n      submitted to the jury in the applicant's trial under Article 37.071,\n      37.0711, or 37.072.\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.071, § 5(a). If the petitioner fails to meet\nthe requirements in § 5(a), the CCA dismisses the petition as an abuse of the\nwrit. Id. § 5(c).\n      The CCA has interpreted § 5(a)(1) as actually involving two steps: (1) the\nlegal or factual basis of the claims were previously unavailable and (2) “the\nspecific facts alleged, if established, would constitute a constitutional violation\nthat would likely require relief from conviction.”      Ex parte Campbell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2165920\"><a href=\"/opinion/2165920/ex-parte-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). “Whether a § 5(a)(1) dismissal is\nindependent of federal law turns on case specific factors. If the CCA’s decision\nrests on availability, the procedural bar is intact.” Rocha II, 626 F.3d at 835.\nIf, on the other hand, “the CCA determines the claim was unavailable but that\n[the habeas petitioner did] not make a prima facie showing of merit, a federal\ncourt can review that under the [standard set out in § 2254(d)]”. Id. This Court\nhas interpreted Campbell to mean that the CCA applies the separate § 5(a)(1)\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\f      Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279     Page: 13   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nsteps sequentially. Id. at 834. If the CCA dismisses the petition under § 5(a)(2)\nor § 5(a)(3), this Court can also review it under the standard in § 2254(d).\n        The issue here is more complicated because the CCA dismissed Canales’s\nsubsequent habeas petition as an abuse of the writ under § 5(a) without\nspecifying whether it was doing so based on availability or based on the merits.\nSee Ex parte Canales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">383804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (“We have reviewed the\napplication and the briefs of both parties and find that all of the allegations\nfail to satisfy the requirements of Article 11.071, § 5(a).”).

He points out that the CCA\nspecifically asked for briefing on the merits of his Wiggins claim. Canales also\nargues that the CCA knows how to make a clear statement that it is not\nreaching the merits, see, e.g., Ex parte Foster, No. WR-65,799-03, at *2 (Tex.\nCrim. App. Sept. 12, 2011) (unpublished); because the CCA did not make a\nclear statement that it was avoiding the merits, Canales argues, the CCA\nactually reached the merits. Finally, Canales attempts to distinguish his case\nfrom others where we have found that a boilerplate dismissal was independent\nof federal law. He claims that in those cases, the habeas petitioner had not\nargued he could prove his claim was unavailable at the time of his first state\nhabeas application. See, e.g., Balentine, 626 F.3d at 855. But Canales argued\nthat he could show that his claim was unavailable, and thus he urges us to\nhold that the CCA reached the merits of his petition.\n      We find these arguments unpersuasive, and we hold that the CCA’s\ndismissal of Canales’s petition was based on independent and adequate state\ngrounds. First, we consider all of Canales’s claims except his Wiggins claim.\nWe begin by noting that there is no indication that the CCA reached the merits\nof any these claims. See Puckett v. Epps, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665 (5th Cir. 2011) (“To\navoid procedural bar, in some form, the state court has to make a fair indication\nthat the merits of the claim were reached.” (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). Canales’s subsequent state habeas petition confirms that we\nshould apply a procedural bar to these claims. Canales did not ask the CCA to\nreach the merits of his claims. Instead, he argued that the legal and factual\n                                       14\n\f   Case: 12-70034      Document: 00512752279    Page: 15   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nbases of his claims were previously unavailable under Texas Code of Criminal\nProcedure article 11.071, § 5(a)(1), and he asked the CCA to remand his claims\nto state district court. The fact that the CCA dismissed his petition as an abuse\nof the writ, instead of remanding them to state district court for a merits\ndetermination, shows that the CCA dismissed them pursuant to § 5(a)(1). We\nhave previously held that “the Texas abuse of the writ doctrine has been\nconsistently applied as a procedural bar, and that it is an independent and\nadequate state ground for the purpose of imposing a procedural bar.” Hughes,\n530 F.3d at 342; see also Rocha II, 626 F.3d at 835 (“If the CCA’s decision rests\non availability, the procedural bar is intact.”). Thus, we apply the procedural\nbar to these claims.\n      While the question of whether the CCA’s dismissal of Canales’s Wiggins\nclaim is interwoven with federal law is more difficult to resolve, we hold that\nthe procedural bar applies to his Wiggins claim. As Canales points out, there\nis some indication that the CCA may have reached the merits of Canales’s\nWiggins claim: the CCA asked for briefing on the merits of that claim. So, we\nmust look to the arguments made in state court to try to determine whether\nthe dismissal was based on independent and adequate state law or whether\ninstead it relied on or was interwoven with federal law. See Balentine, 626\nF.3d at 854–56. In his subsequent state habeas petition, Canales argued that\n“the legal basis for his claims was previously unavailable.” See Tex. Code Crim.\nProc. Ann. art. 11.071, § 59(a)(1). As with his other claims, Canales did not\nask the CCA to reach the merits of his Wiggins claim. While he argued that\nhe could meet the standards set out in § 5(a)(2) and § 5(a)(3), he did not ask\nthe CCA to make that decision, instead asking the CCA to remand his Wiggins\nclaim to Texas state district court. As we discussed above, the CCA’s decision\nto dismiss his application without remanding it to the state district court shows\nthat its decision rested on independent and adequate state grounds.           Cf.\n                                       15\n\f     Case: 12-70034   Document: 00512752279      Page: 16    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nColeman, 501 U.S. at 744 (“There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme\nCourt’s ‘consideration’ of all filed papers [which discussed the merits of\nColeman’s federal claims] adds some ambiguity, but we simply cannot read it\nas overriding the court’s explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on\nprocedural grounds. Those grounds are independent of federal law.”).\n       Thus, we hold that a procedural bar applies to all of Canales’s claims.\nC.     Claims on which the District Court Granted a COA\n       As discussed above, we agree with the district court’s decision to apply a\nprocedural bar to all of Canales’s claims. Because his claims are procedurally\ndefaulted, we will not review them unless Canales “can demonstrate cause for\nthe default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation[s] of federal\nlaw.” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 749.\n       1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (Wiggins Claim)\n       Canales argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during\nboth the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. When the district court\nconsidered these claims, it found that Canales could not prove cause and\nprejudice to excuse the procedural default. But since the district court issued\nits opinion, the Supreme Court has clarified the ways a habeas petitioner can\nshow cause to excuse a procedural default.\n       The district court’s procedural ruling relied on our decision in Ibarra v.\nThaler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), overruled by Trevino v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), did not apply\nin Texas. In Martinez, the Supreme Court considered for the first time whether\nineffective assistance of counsel in an initial-review collateral proceeding could\nprovide cause to excuse procedural default of a claim for ineffective assistance\nof trial counsel. Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1316. The Supreme Court answered\nin the affirmative, holding that when an initial-review collateral proceeding is\nthe first time a petitioner can raise a claim for ineffective assistance of trial\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 17    Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\ncounsel, the ineffective assistance of counsel in that initial-review collateral\nproceeding can provide cause to excuse the procedural default. Martinez, 132\nS. Ct. at 1318. In Ibarra, we reasoned that Martinez did not apply in Texas\nbecause Texas law did not require that a Texas defendant raise his ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel claim for the first time in a collateral proceeding.\nIbarra, 687 F.3d at 227. But in Trevino, the Supreme Court explained that\nMartinez applies in Texas because the “state procedural framework, by reason\nof its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a\ndefendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel on direct appeal.” Trevino, 133 S. Ct. at 1921. Thus,\nin light of Trevino, there is a proving cause for procedural default that was not\navailable when Canales was before the district court.\n      In order to establish cause to excuse his procedural default, Canales\nmust prove that his counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding was\ndeficient; that is, he must show that the representation of his initial-review\ncollateral proceeding “fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” See\nStrickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688 (1984); see also Martinez, 132 S.\nCt. at 1318 (citing Strickland as the appropriate standard for judging whether\nstate habeas counsel was ineffective). As part of establishing cause, Canales\nmust also show that “the underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim is a substantial one, which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate\nthat the claim has some merit.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1318 (citing Miller-El\nv. Cockrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122258\"><a href=\"/opinion/122258/miller-el-v-cockrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003)).\n      To excuse the procedural default fully, Canales would then be required\nto prove that he suffered prejudice from the ineffective assistance of his trial\ncounsel. See Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1321 (remanding to the court of appeals\nto “address the question of prejudice”). Prejudice requires a showing that there\nis “a reasonable probability that, but for [trial] counsel’s unprofessional errors,\n                                        17\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 18   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.           A reasonable\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694; see also Sells v. Stephens, 536 F. App’x 483, 493\n(5th Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (“In order to satisfy the performance prong, Sells\nmust show that both his trial and habeas counsels’ representation fell below\nan ‘objective standard of reasonableness.’ Under the second prong, Sells must\nshow that there is ‘a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the\nsentence . . . would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” (citations omitted)).\n      We look first at Canales’s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective\nduring the guilt phase of his trial. Canales first argues that his trial counsel\nfailed to impeach witnesses effectively.    Second, Canales claims his trial\ncounsel was ineffective in affirmatively aiding the State in proving part of his\nmurder charge. Canales was charged under Texas Penal Code § 19.03(a)(5)(B)\n“which makes it a capital offense for a person to knowingly or intentionally\nmurder another person, while incarcerated in a penal institution, with the\nintent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination or in the profits\nof a combination.” Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 692–93. He argues that his trial\ncounsel essentially conceded the combination element when they tried to\ninculpate Whited, who was a member of the Texas Mafia, in the murder.\n      The problem is that Canales has not established cause for the procedural\ndefault of his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during the guilt\nphase because the claim is not substantial. Though Canales argues his trial\ncounsel should have impeached witnesses more effectively, our review of the\nrecord shows that the jury actually heard testimony regarding the witnesses’\ninconsistent statements, racism, and potential bias against Canales—the\nevidence that he claims his trial counsel should have used for impeachment.\nIn addition, there was other evidence—aside from testimony tying Whited to\n                                      18\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 19   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthe murder—that proved the combination element. The state put forward\nevidence of Canales’s membership in the Texas Mafia that proved the\ncombination element of the crime even without any inculpating Whited in the\nmurder. See Canales, 98 S.W.3d at 697. Thus, because Canales’s claim of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel during the guilt phase of his trial lacks\nmerit, he cannot prove cause to excuse the procedural default.\n      We turn next to Canales’s claim that he received ineffective assistance\nof trial counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial. Canales argues his\ntrial counsel was ineffective because he failed to thoroughly investigate and\npresent mitigation evidence. He also argues that the performance of his state\nhabeas counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Canales’s\nstate habeas counsel did not conduct a mitigation investigation due to a\nmisunderstanding of funding for habeas investigations: his state habeas\ncounsel thought his funding was capped at $25,000, and so he only dedicated\n$2,500 to investigation—and most of that went to issues related to innocence.\nBoth parties agree, however, that funding was not capped at $25,000.\n      First, we agree with Canales that the performance of his state habeas\ncounsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. The Supreme Court\nrecently considered a similar situation in which trial attorney failed to request\nadditional funding to replace an inadequate expert because of a mistaken belief\nabout the amount of funding available. Hinton v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2654277\"><a href=\"/opinion/2654277/hinton-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1088 (2014) (per curiam). The Court held that the trial lawyer’s decisions\n“based not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available\nfunding was capped [at a certain amount]” constituted deficient performance.\nHinton, 134 S. Ct. at 1088–89. Similarly, Canales’s state habeas counsel did\nnot make a strategic choice to forego a mitigation investigation. Instead, he\nchose not to pursue that claim in any depth because he thought he could not\n\n\n                                       19\n\f    Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279    Page: 20   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nreceive any additional funding to pursue those claims.         Accordingly, his\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n      Because Canales has established that his state habeas counsel’s\nbehavior was deficient, we now consider whether there is some merit to his\nclaim that his trial counsel were ineffective at sentencing. By Canales’s trial\ncounsel’s own admission, they did not conduct any mitigation investigation. A\ndeclaration from his trial counsel shows that trial counsel did not hire a\nmitigation specialist, interview family members or others who knew him\ngrowing up, or “collect any records or any historical data on his life.” During\nsentencing, the only mitigation evidence his counsel presented was that he was\n“a gifted artist” and “a peacemaker in prison.” Even the prosecutor noticed the\ndearth of any mitigating evidence, stating “it’s an incredibly sad tribute that\nwhen a man’s life is on the line about the only good thing we can say about him\nis that he’s a good artist.”\n      If Canales’s trial attorneys had conducted a mitigation investigation,\nthey would have discovered an extensive history of physical abuse, emotional\nabuse, and neglect. Canales’s mother was an alcoholic who neglected her\nchildren, and his father was violent, angry, and irrational. After Canales’s\nparents separated, his mother married a man who was physically abusive,\nbeating Canales with a belt and fist and forcing him to strip naked prior to\nthese beatings. Canales’s step-father sexually abused his sister, and Canales\nattempted, in vain, to protect her. The family lived in poor housing, infested\nwith flea and lice and located in “gang central.” Canales’s grandparents were\nalso physically and verbally abusive. Eventually, Canales’s mother left him\nwith his father. The beatings then resumed, and Canales’s father would beat\nhim “until his father got tired.” This led Canales to abuse drugs and alcohol,\n“hook[] up with the wrong people,” and begin committing crimes. He lived in\nhalf-way houses for part of his teenage years. Canales’s sister stated that the\n                                      20\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 21   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\ndeath of Canales’s mother impacted Canales severely and that he “went off the\ndeep end” after she passed away.\n      Based on these facts, we hold that Canales’s ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel claim has some merit. First, we conclude that Canales’s trial counsel’s\nperformance was deficient during the sentencing phase. A decision not to\ninvestigate “must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the\ncircumstances.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 533 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n691). Considering all of the circumstances here, Canales’s trial attorneys’\nperformance was not reasonable. His trial counsel did not make a reasoned\ndecision not to conduct a mitigation investigation. Cf. Wood v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742/wood-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301–03 (2010) (denying habeas relief and noting that “counsel’s failure to\npursue or present evidence of [the defendant’s] mental deficiencies was not\nmere oversight or neglect but instead the result of a deliberate decision to focus\non other defenses”). His trial counsel’s failure to consider mitigation evidence\nhad nothing to do with Canales or any attempt on his part to obstruct his trial\ncounsel in pursuing an investigation into mitigating evidence.          Compare\nSchriro v. Landrigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145734\"><a href=\"/opinion/145734/schriro-v-landrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478–81 (2007) (state court did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland in denying habeas relief where the defendant\nrefused to allow his counsel to present mitigating evidence from his family and\nthe only other mitigating evidence was that the defendant may have a genetic\npredisposition to violence), with Rompilla v.

Simply put, his\ncounsel’s failure to do any investigating “resulted from inattention, not\nreasoned strategic judgment.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 256.\n      Second, Canales has shown that there is some merit to the claim that he\nwas prejudiced by his trial counsel’s deficient behavior during sentencing. The\n                                       21\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 22   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nonly mitigation evidence put forward during sentencing was that Canales was\na gifted artist and a peacemaker in prison. The jury did not hear any evidence\nregarding Canales’s childhood, which was full of violence and privation. While\nthere was certainly evidence to support a finding of future dangerousness, we\nare not convinced that evidence is enough to say that Canales’s claim is not\nsubstantial. We are persuaded that the Supreme Court’s decisions in Williams\nv. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), and Rompilla v.

See Rompilla,\n545 U.S. at 390–93 (state court decision denying habeas relief was\nunreasonable where additional mitigation investigation regarding the\ndefendant’s abusive, impoverished childhood and alcohol-related causes of the\ndefendant’s juvenile incarcerations might have influenced the jury’s evaluation\nof culpability); Williams, 529 U.S. at 398–99 (state court decision denying\nhabeas relief was unreasonable where new mitigation evidence, including “the\ngraphic description of [the defendant’s] childhood, filled with abuse and\nprivation, or the reality that he was ‘borderline mentally retarded,’ might well\nhave influenced the jury’s appraisal of his moral culpability” despite the\n“strength of the prosecution evidence supporting the future dangerous\naggravating circumstance”). Given all this, there is some merit to the notion\nthat, had trial counsel’s performance not been deficient during sentencing, “at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S.\nat 537. Thus, we conclude that Canales’s claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel during sentencing is substantial.\n      The question then becomes whether Canales can actually prove prejudice\ndue to the deficient performance of his habeas counsel. Claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel present a mixed question of law and fact.         Lamb v.\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18034\"><a href=\"/opinion/18034/lamb-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (5th Cir. 1999).

The district court,\nthough, has not yet addressed Canales’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nbecause its order was issued before Trevino. Moreover, Canales has not yet\nhad the chance to develop the factual basis for this claim because, until\nTrevino, it was procedurally defaulted. While there is sufficient information\nbefore this Court for us to conclude that there is some merit to Canales’s claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel, we think the district court should address\nthe prejudice question in the first instance. Our recent post-Trevino decisions\nsupport this decision. In cases where the district court made its decision before\nTrevino and the district court did not make an alternative merits\ndetermination, we have remanded the case to the district court. See Balentine\nv. Stephens, 553 F. App’x 424, 425 (5th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (unpublished);\nTrevino v.

We remand this claim for the district court to consider whether\nCanales can prove prejudice as a result of his trial counsel’s deficient\nperformance, and if so, to address the merits of his habeas petition on this\nclaim. 2\n       2. Use of State Agent to Solicit Incriminating Evidence (Massiah Claim)\n       Canales argues that Texas used Innes as a state agent to solicit\nincriminating evidence from him after he was indicted in violation of his Sixth\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights. An individual’s Sixth Amendment rights\n\n\n\n       2  Texas argues that if we decide to remand any claims to the district court, we should\ndeny Canales the opportunity to have an evidentiary hearing. We decline to take this step,\nand we leave the determination of whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate to the\ndistrict court.\n                                             23\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279     Page: 24   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                No. 12-70034\nhave been violated when the state is allowed to use “against him at his trial\nevidence from his own incriminating words, which [state] agents had\ndeliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of\nhis counsel.” Massiah v.

The dispute\nhere focuses on the February 2000 letter, which Canales wrote to Innes. In the\nletter, Canales appears to ask the gang to retaliate against Larry Whited\nbecause Canales believed Whited had turned him in for his role in Dickerson’s\nkilling. Canales argues that Innes was already working for the state by the\ntime Canales was indicted in November 1999.        He also claims the Texas\nencouraged Innes to elicit inculpatory information from him. Canales further\nclaims that Texas suppressed the information that Innes was working as a\nstate agent. Thus, Canales claims he can show cause for the procedural default\nbecause state officials prevented him from learning this information.\n      Canales also argues that this had a substantial and injurious effect on\nhis trial and his sentence. He claims the February 2000 letter was necessary\nto introduce the 1998 confessional letter. Canales explains the February 2000\nletter was matched to him through his fingerprint. He argues the prosecution\nused that fingerprint to admit the 1998 confessional letter. He then claims\n                                      24\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 25   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthat without the 1998 confessional letter, the state would only have had the\ntestimony of unreliable inmate witnesses.       Moreover, he argues that the\nprosecution used the February 2000 letter as evidence of his future\ndangerousness, which it needed for Canales to receive the death penalty. Thus,\nhe claims he has shown actual prejudice.\n      Even if Canales could establish cause, we hold he cannot prove actual\nprejudice based on these alleged violations. Looking at the guilt phase of the\ntrial, Canales’s primary argument is that, without the February 2000 letter,\nTexas could not have admitted the 1998 confessional letter.             But the\nprosecution relied on more than fingerprint evidence to authenticate the 1998\nconfessional letter: the State also offered testimony matching the letter to\nCanales’s handwriting.     Though Canales disparages this as lay-witness\ntestimony, he does not argue that it would have been insufficient to admit the\n1998 letter. Further, under the Texas Rules of Evidence, nonexpert opinion on\nhandwriting can be used to authenticate and identify documents. Tex. R. Evid.\n901. Thus, the confessional letter could have been admitted even without the\nFebruary 2000 letter.\n      Turning next to sentencing, the state did not rely solely on the February\n2000 letter to prove future dangerousness. Cf. Westbrook v. Thaler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"69253\"><a href=\"/opinion/69253/wesbrook-v-thaler/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that the alleged Massiah violation in\nmistakenly admitting evidence that the defendant solicited the murder of three\npeople did not have a substantial and injurious effect on sentencing in light of\nevidence that the defendant had murdered five people and solicited murders of\ntwo others). The jury had the April 2000 letter, wherein Canales threatened\ninformants. The jury had evidence that Canales was part of a gang, and that\nCanales had committed murder in connection with his prison gang (because\nthe jury had convicted him based on the combination element). The jury also\nknew that Canales was in prison serving a fifteen-year sentence for aggravated\n                                      25\n\f    Case: 12-70034       Document: 00512752279        Page: 26     Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-70034\nsexual assault and that he had already served a five-year sentence on an\nearlier sexual assault. Thus, Canales has not proven that the alleged Massiah\nviolation had a substantial and injurious effect on his trial. 3\n       3. Failure to Correct False Testimony (Giglio/Napue Claim)\n       Canales next argues that the state solicited false testimony from Innes,\nor at least, allowed testimony the State knew was false to go uncorrected. The\nSupreme Court has repeatedly held that “a conviction obtained through false\nevidence, known to be such by representatives of the State” violates a\ndefendant’s constitutional rights. See Miller v.

The magistrate judge’s report and recommendations indicates that the\nmagistrate judge reached the merits, but the district court made some modifications when it\naccepted the proposed findings and recommendations. Specifically, the district court stated\nthat it had determined “that the admission of the [February 2000] letter did not have a\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.” The district\ncourt’s language mirrors language the Supreme Court has used to define prejudice. See\nFrady, 456 U.S. at 170 (explaining proving actual prejudice means the petitioner must prove\nthat the errors “worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage”). Thus, we agree with\nthe district court’s decision to deny Canales’s Massiah claim because it was procedurally\ndefaulted and conclude he did not prove actual prejudice.\n                                            26\n\f    Case: 12-70034      Document: 00512752279        Page: 27     Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-70034\n      Neither party disputes that Canales can establish cause for procedurally\ndefaulting this claim, but the parties disagree over whether the testimony was\nfalse and whether it was material. Canales argues Innes gave false testimony\nabout the 1998 confessional letter. Canales says Innes testified he asked\nCanales to write him a letter describing Dickerson’s murder, and he watched\nCanales tie the kite 4 on a string that Innes pulled into his cell. But Canales\nsays a prison official’s handwritten notes from a meeting with Innes show that\nanother inmate received the letter from Canales. 5 Canales argues that the\nstate had access to the prison official’s notes, and so the state knew Innes’s\ntrial testimony was false. Further, he argues it was material because Innes’s\ncredibility was important, and knowing this false testimony would have given\na different picture of the state’s case.\n      We disagree and hold that the district court was correct to deny this\nclaim. First, Canales has not established that Innes’s testimony was false or\nthat the State knew that it was false. The prison official’s handwritten notes\nare not dated; they do not say whose comments were being recorded; and they\ndo not mention Innes at all. As the district court concluded, it is far from clear\nthat the notes even refer to Innes. Moreover, while Innes was an important\nwitness, the interview notes do not directly contradict his testimony. The notes\ndo not state that Innes was the subject of the interview; if the notes were from\n\n\n      4 According to trial testimony, a kite is a handwritten note that is written between\ninmates.\n      5 According to both parties, the notes stated in full:\n\n             written by Canales\n             Another inmate has the letter - he’s not involved @\n             all – will have to get the letter from him\n             Another inmate rec the letter from Canales\n             This inmate sent me the letter to see it\n             The letter is step for step how the letter [sic]\n             went down.\n             The letter is in Canales’ handwriting\n\n                                           27\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279      Page: 28   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\nan interview with someone else, Innes could be the other inmate referenced in\nthe interview notes who received Canales’s letter.

While the confessional letter itself was very\nimportant to the prosecution’s case, the allegedly false testimony only served\nto explain how Innes received the letter, not to the substance of the letter. So,\neven if the false testimony might have made the jury question Innes’s\ncredibility, it would not have changed the fact that the letter was signed by\nCanales, written in Canales’s handwriting, and described Dickerson’s murder.\nThus, we cannot say that there is a reasonable likelihood that the false\ntestimony affected the judgment of the jury, and so the district court correctly\ndenied Canales’s false testimony claim.\n      4. Failure to Disclose Impeachment Evidence (Brady Claim)\n      Canales argues that Texas suppressed several pieces of impeachment\nevidence in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963), the Supreme Court held that “the suppression\nby the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates\ndue process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\nirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Id. at 87. “There\nare three components of a true Brady violation”: (1) the evidence at issue,\nwhether exculpatory or impeaching, must be favorable to the accused; (2) “that\nevidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or\ninadvertently”; and (3) “prejudice must have ensued.” Strickler v. Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281–82 (1999).\n\n\n                                         28\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 29   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\n      Evidence is material for purposes of Brady “if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different,” meaning the probability is\n“sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” United States v. Bagley,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). To evaluate\nmateriality, courts should not simply ask whether, “after discounting the\ninculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, the remaining\nevidence is sufficient to support the jury’s conclusions.” Strickler, 527 U.S. at\n290. Instead, the proper inquiry is whether “the favorable evidence could\nreasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\nundermine confidence in the verdict.” Id. The materiality of the suppressed\nevidence should be assessed collectively. Kyles v. Whitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436\n(1995).   The prejudice component is the same as materiality for Brady\npurposes. Banks v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131165\"><a href=\"/opinion/131165/banks-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 691 (2004) (“[C]oincident with the\nthird Brady component (prejudice), prejudice within the compass of the ‘cause\nand prejudice’ requirement exists when the suppressed evidence is ‘material’\nfor Brady purposes.”).\n      Though neither party disputes that Canales can demonstrate cause for\nhis procedural default, they disagree about whether Canales can prove\nprejudice. Canales argues the state suppressed five pieces of impeachment\nevidence. First, Innes was also a suspect in Dickerson’s murder. Second, Innes\nhad a weapon-possession charge dismissed as in exchange for testifying.\nThird, the State assisted inmate witnesses with issues concerning housing,\nprison conditions, and parole. Fourth, the State encouraged Innes and Whited\nto communicate with each other before trial. Fifth, Innes continued in prison\ngang activities after renouncing his membership. Canales claims that witness\ncredibility was an important issue in the case, and that looking at the\n\n\n                                       29\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 30   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\ncumulative impact of this evidence, there is a reasonable probability the\noutcome would have been different.\n      We hold that Canales has not demonstrated actual prejudice that would\nexcuse the procedural default. Turning first to Canales’s claim that the State\nassisted prisoners who testified against him, the record shows that the jury\nheard at least some of this information at trial. Canales’s attorneys at least\nasked some inmate–witnesses about being encouraged to help the State in\nexchange for benefits, such as help with their cases and being moved to a\ndifferent prison. “The materiality of Brady material depends almost entirely\non the value of the evidence relative to the other evidence mustered by the\nstate.” Rocha v.

Our Court has granted habeas relief based on Brady claims\nwhen the impeachment evidence that was withheld was the only direct\nevidence linking the defendant to the crime. See LaCaze v. Warden La. Corr.\nInst. for Women, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219970\"><a href=\"/opinion/219970/lacaze-v-warden-la-corrtl-institute-for-women/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738 (5th Cir. 2011); Tassin v.

We have also considered it important if the\nprosecutor told the jury that the witnesses had no reason to lie. LaCaze, 645\nF.3d at 738; Tassin, 517 F.3d at 781. Neither of those circumstances is present\nhere. In this case, the witness testimony was not the only evidence linking the\ndefendant to the crime; the jury had Canales’s letter describing Dickerson’s\nmurder. In addition, the prosecutor raised the issue of the inmate–witness’s\ncredibility, telling the jury that reliance on inmate testimony was a “legitimate\nconcern,” that “inmates lie,” and stating “I would be an utter fool to stand here\nand try to convince you to believe everything our witnesses told you.”\n      Turning next to Canales’s claims about the information that was\nallegedly withheld about Innes, we note that Canales’s attorney questioned\nInnes about the deal he received in exchange for his testimony. The jury heard\n                                       30\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 31   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nthat Innes had a pending weapon charge that, combined with his two prior\nconvictions, could have resulted in a 99-year sentence, but that Innes only\nreceived two three-year sentences to run concurrently.\n      While the allegation that the State suppressed the fact that Innes was a\nsuspect is more serious, that does not change our conclusion. This Court and\nother courts have sometimes held that withholding evidence of another suspect\nwas a Brady violation, particularly when the other evidence linking the\ndefendant to the crime was limited. See, e.g., Graves v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793762\"><a href=\"/opinion/793762/anthony-graves-v-doug-dretke-director-texas-department-of-criminal/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n343–44 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding a Brady violation where, had the defense\nknown about the other suspect, the defense could have “persuasively argued”\nthat the other suspect had committed the murder and the evidence at trial\nrested “almost entirely on [the other suspect’s] testimony”); Bowen v. Maynard,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475335\"><a href=\"/opinion/475335/clifford-henry-bowen-v-gary-d-maynard-warden-oklahoma-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610–13 (10th Cir. 1986) (holding there was a Brady violation\nwhen the “only identification evidence against the defendant was significantly\nimpeachable” with the evidence of the other suspect that was withheld). But\nthere is not a Brady violation every time the government does not disclose an\nalternative suspect, especially when the other suspect was not a particularly\nplausible one. See, e.g., Spence v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715800\"><a href=\"/opinion/715800/david-wayne-spence-v-gary-l-johnson-director-texas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998–99 (5th Cir. 1996)\n(holding there was no Brady violation when, even if the defense counsel had\nhad information about the other suspect at trial, the prosecution would have\nbeen able to “exonerate[e]” the other suspect with other facts).\n      Here, unlike in Graves and Bowen, there was still other evidence besides\nInnes’s testimony at trial that would have supported the verdict, namely the\n1998 confessional letter describing the murder step-by-step. Given this, and\nconsidering the materiality of the Brady material relative to the other evidence\nat trial, there is not a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been\n\n\n\n\n                                      31\n\f    Case: 12-70034        Document: 00512752279           Page: 32      Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-70034\nchanged if Canales had known this information.                    Thus, the district court\ncorrectly denied Canales habeas petition on these claims. 6\n       5. Trial Court Rulings, Cumulative Effect, and Jury Claims\n       Canales also argues that (1) the trial court’s rulings violated his right to\npresent a defense; (2) the cumulative effect of his ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and the withholding of evidence violated his right to due process; and\n(3) his Sixth, Eight, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated because\nseveral jurors lied about their criminal background.                       Canales did not\nseparately brief these claims, instead relying on another portion of his brief in\nwhich he argued that the state court’s ruling was not based on independent\nand adequate state grounds. While that portion of the brief attempted to\nestablish cause for the procedural default of these claims, Canales never\nargued that these alleged constitutional violations resulted in actual prejudice.\n“It is a well worn principle that the failure to raise an issue on appeal\nconstitutes waiver of that argument.” See United States v. Griffith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"59544\"><a href=\"/opinion/59544/united-states-v-griffith/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing United States v. Thibodeaux, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"20743\"><a href=\"/opinion/20743/united-states-v-thibodeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n912(5th Cir. 2000). Because Canales has waived any argument that he can\nestablish prejudice that would excuse his procedural default, we will not\naddress these issues on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       6  As it did with the Massiah claim, Texas again argues that the district court\nimproperly reached the merits of this claim. In its order denying Canales’s petition, the\ndistrict court explained that the standard for the prejudice element of cause and prejudice\nand the standard for materiality under Brady are the same. The district court then stated,\n“Because the Court accepts the Magistrate Judge’s proposed finding of no prejudice, it would\nbe equally correct to characterize the disposition of this claim as a dismissal under the\ndoctrine of procedural default or as a denial of the substantive claim on the merits.” Texas\nargues that was error, because a federal court should not reach the merits of a claim that has\nbeen procedurally defaulted unless the petitioner can prove cause and prejudice. We agree,\nand so in affirming the district court’s decision, we clarify that our holding rests on procedural\ndefault without reaching the merits of Canales’s claim.\n\n                                               32\n\f   Case: 12-70034       Document: 00512752279    Page: 33   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-70034\n      6. Shackling Claim\n      Canales argues that his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights\nwere violated when he was shackled during the sentencing phase of his trial.\nThe district court reached the merits of this claim, because it found Canales\nhad presented it both in his direct appeal and in his first state habeas petition,\nand the state court adjudicated this claim on the merits. On appeal, however,\nTexas argues Canales did not present his claim in state court, and so it is\nprocedurally defaulted.\n      We agree with Texas that Canales did not fairly present his shackling\nclaim in state court.     “The exhaustion requirement is satisfied when the\nsubstance of the federal habeas claim has been fairly presented to the highest\nstate court.” Whithead v. Johnson, 157 F3d 384, 387 (5th Cir. 1998). For a\nclaim to have been fairly presented, the state court must “be alerted to the fact\nthat the prisoners are asserting claims under the United States Constitution.”\nDuncan v Henry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1431594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1431594/duncan-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365–66 (1995) (per curiam).

See id. at 277. But the federal\nappellate court had found the habeas petitioner’s rights under the Equal\nProtection Clause had been violated. Id. The Court disagreed that the state\ncourt had had an opportunity to rule on his constitutional claim. Id. It “[could\n                                       33\n\f   Case: 12-70034     Document: 00512752279     Page: 34   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-70034\nnot] fault [the state court] for failing also to consider sua sponte whether the\nindictment procedure denied respondent equal protection of the laws.” Id.; see\nalso Duncan, 513 U.S. at 366.\n      After reviewing Canales’s first state habeas petition, we conclude that\nCanales did not “fairly present” his constitutional claim in his first state\nhabeas petition. Canales relied primarily on Texas state court cases, arguing\nthat his shackling was improper under Gammage v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774811\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774811/gammage-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 1982, pet. ref’d.). While Canales quoted from Illinois\nv. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108110\"><a href=\"/opinion/108110/illinois-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970), which established that unnecessary shackling\nduring trial was a violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights, and noted\nthat Gammage cited Allen, Canales did not cite Allen for its constitutional\nholding. Rather, he only argued that the trial court “abused its discretion and\nunfairly prejudiced” him when it allowed him to be shackled during the\npunishment phase of his trial. The state trial court’s ruling on the shackling\nclaim, which the CCA adopted, makes no indication that the court saw this\nissue as a constitutional one. “[A] claim for relief in habeas corpus must\ninclude reference to a specific federal constitutional guarantee, as well as a\nstatement of the facts which entitle the petitioner to relief.”         Gray v.\nNetherland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118048\"><a href=\"/opinion/118048/gray-v-netherland/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162–63 (1996). Because it does not appear that\nCanales’s shackling claim was fairly presented in his first state habeas\npetition, we hold that this claim was procedurally defaulted.\n      Next, we consider whether Canales has established cause and prejudice\nto excuse the procedural default.      But Canales does not argue cause or\nprejudice; instead, he only argues that the state court reached the merits of\nthis claim during his first habeas petition and that it warrants relief. When\nhe filed his reply brief, Canales was on notice that Texas had argued that his\nshackling claim had not been fairly presented to the state court in his first\nhabeas petition. He knew, too, that if we held that his claim had not been fairly\n                                       34\n\f   Case: 12-70034    Document: 00512752279      Page: 35   Date Filed: 08/29/2014\n\n\n\n                                No. 12-70034\npresented in his first habeas petition and was instead procedurally defaulted,\nhe would need to argue he could overcome that by showing cause and prejudice.\nCanales, though, did not address these arguments at all in his reply brief.\nThus, his shackling claim was inadequately briefed and abandoned, and we\nwill not reach it on appeal. See United States v. Cothran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"28424\"><a href=\"/opinion/28424/united-states-v-cothran/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286\nn.7 (5th Cir. 2002) (arguments not adequately briefed were considered\nabandoned).\n                            IV. CONCLUSION\n     We REVERSE the district court’s dismissal of Canales’s claim that he\nreceived ineffective assistance of trial counsel during sentencing, and we\nREMAND for the district court to consider whether Canales can prove\nprejudice. As to all other claims, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                     35\n\f</pre>",
