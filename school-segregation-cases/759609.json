The new Scotland Neck district was legislatively authorized in March 1969, approved by the voters in April 1969, and was proposed to begin operating in the fall of 1969.

School Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430 (88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716) (1968), charged \"(s) chool boards . . . then operating state-compelled dual systems . . . with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.\"  The Board of Trustees of FBISD is clearly so charged.  In U. S. v. Scotland Neck City Board of Education et al., 407 U.S. 484 (92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75) (1972) decided the same day as Emporia, Halifax County was not under a court-ordered desegregation plan.  There the \"parent\" school district had entered into an agreement with the United States Department of Justice to implement a plan designed to dismantle its dual school system.  Though the context of Emporia and many other cases is that the \"parent\" district was under a court-ordered desegregation plan, there is no language in those opinions which limits this court from deciding the issue because FBISD chose to voluntarily comply with the law. Any assertion by Stafford that the posture of this case is altered by that fact is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">449 F.Supp. at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing conclusion by the district court would be correct if the Fort Bend system has never attained unitary status.

However, the court made no express findings that constitutional violations remain uncorrected, and the parties are not able to point out to us hard evidence that would justify our making such a finding at the appellate level.  The court did not find that the efforts of Stafford to create a new district are racially motivated, and the parties concede that there is no such motivation.  The court found that in several ways the withdrawal of Stafford will have an erosive effect upon steps FBISD has taken pursuant to the plan approved by HEW in 1965.  As the district court succinctly put it, FBISD asserts that the new district \"will have a negative effect on the continued implementation of its desegregation plan.\" Id. at 377.  The court found there would be fewer black students in each grade in Stafford than there are in FBISD, and that without Stafford \"the ability of FBISD to continue to zone minority students into each neighborhood school will be substantially restricted.\" Id. at 380.  It found that the enrichment program begun by FBISD would lose funds and that fewer minority students would participate.  The court also found that the operation of Stafford would obstruct the implementation by FBISD of planned construction, site selection (particularly the placement of schools between racially identifiable neighborhoods), and attendance zones and would \"restrict FBISD's future implementation of its desegregation plan.\" Id. at 382.  Finally, it concluded that the quality of education presently offered by FBISD would be diminished in both districts if Stafford is permitted to split off and that creation of Stafford would encourage other areas to form new districts. Id. at 382-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other findings tend to imply that the system is unitary.  The court found that FBISD has operated under the desegregation plan since 1965 without substantial modification; it has redrawn its attendance zones for elementary schools each year that a new school has been added; school sites are selected under a Board policy of having neighborhood schools and an ethnic balance in accord with the district-wide balance; the Board is making a good faith effort to avoid placing schools in the middle of one-race subdivisions; a substantial part of minority students participate in enrichment courses.  Also, the court said: \"In effectuating the Supreme Court's charge to eliminate racial discrimination 'root and branch', FBISD using all its resources undertook a complete program of education to meet the needs of all its students.\" Id. at 383.  In one of its findings the court referred to FBISD's \"former dual system.\" Id. at 384.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no court order or pending suit that will be interfered with by creation of Stafford.  We cannot tell whether as a result of the plan approved by HEW in 1965 the dual Fort Bend system has been eliminated and the system is now unitary.  Stafford, emphasizing the words italicized by us in the findings quoted above, vigorously insists that the Fort Bend system has been unitary for more than 10 years.  FBISD, while reluctant to acknowledge the present existence of specific unconstitutional deficiencies, insists with equal vigor that, since the court found it is engaged in ongoing programs and means commenced pursuant to the 1965 desegregation plan, the court either expressly or impliedly held it is not unitary.  Neither assertion is acceptable.  Rather, from the appellate view, it appears that the district court walked a narrow line between deciding whether unitary status has or has not been attained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court must be reversed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this action FBISD also purported to appeal to the federal district court the Commissioner's approval of the breakaway plan, claiming that the Commissioner's actions violated the State of Texas mandate.

There the \"parent\" school district had entered into an agreement with the United States Department of Justice to implement a plan designed to dismantle its dual school system.  Though the context of Emporia and many other cases is that the \"parent\" district was under a court-ordered desegregation plan, there is no language in those opinions which limits this court from deciding the issue because FBISD chose to voluntarily comply with the law. Any assertion by Stafford that the posture of this case is altered by that fact is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">449 F.Supp. at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing conclusion by the district court would be correct if the Fort Bend system has never attained unitary status.

However, the court made no express findings that constitutional violations remain uncorrected, and the parties are not able to point out to us hard evidence that would justify our making such a finding at the appellate level.  The court did not find that the efforts of Stafford to create a new district are racially motivated, and the parties concede that there is no such motivation.  The court found that in several ways the withdrawal of Stafford will have an erosive effect upon steps FBISD has taken pursuant to the plan approved by HEW in 1965.  As the district court succinctly put it, FBISD asserts that the new district \"will have a negative effect on the continued implementation of its desegregation plan.\" Id. at 377.  The court found there would be fewer black students in each grade in Stafford than there are in FBISD, and that without Stafford \"the ability of FBISD to continue to zone minority students into each neighborhood school will be substantially restricted.\" Id. at 380.  It found that the enrichment program begun by FBISD would lose funds and that fewer minority students would participate.  The court also found that the operation of Stafford would obstruct the implementation by FBISD of planned construction, site selection (particularly the placement of schools between racially identifiable neighborhoods), and attendance zones and would \"restrict FBISD's future implementation of its desegregation plan.\" Id. at 382.  Finally, it concluded that the quality of education presently offered by FBISD would be diminished in both districts if Stafford is permitted to split off and that creation of Stafford would encourage other areas to form new districts. Id. at 382-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other findings tend to imply that the system is unitary.  The court found that FBISD has operated under the desegregation plan since 1965 without substantial modification; it has redrawn its attendance zones for elementary schools each year that a new school has been added; school sites are selected under a Board policy of having neighborhood schools and an ethnic balance in accord with the district-wide balance; the Board is making a good faith effort to avoid placing schools in the middle of one-race subdivisions; a substantial part of minority students participate in enrichment courses.  Also, the court said: \"In effectuating the Supreme Court's charge to eliminate racial discrimination 'root and branch', FBISD using all its resources undertook a complete program of education to meet the needs of all its students.\" Id. at 383.  In one of its findings the court referred to FBISD's \"former dual system.\" Id. at 384.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no court order or pending suit that will be interfered with by creation of Stafford.  We cannot tell whether as a result of the plan approved by HEW in 1965 the dual Fort Bend system has been eliminated and the system is now unitary.  Stafford, emphasizing the words italicized by us in the findings quoted above, vigorously insists that the Fort Bend system has been unitary for more than 10 years.  FBISD, while reluctant to acknowledge the present existence of specific unconstitutional deficiencies, insists with equal vigor that, since the court found it is engaged in ongoing programs and means commenced pursuant to the 1965 desegregation plan, the court either expressly or impliedly held it is not unitary.  Neither assertion is acceptable.  Rather, from the appellate view, it appears that the district court walked a narrow line between deciding whether unitary status has or has not been attained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court must be reversed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this action FBISD also purported to appeal to the federal district court the Commissioner's approval of the breakaway plan, claiming that the Commissioner's actions violated the State of Texas mandate.
