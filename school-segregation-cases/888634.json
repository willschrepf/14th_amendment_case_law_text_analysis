We hold that the standing doctrine adopted in Lee v Macomb\n\n Co Bd of Comm’rs, 464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), and extended in later cases,\n\n such as Nat’l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, 471 Mich 608; 684 NW2d\n\f800 (2004), lacks a basis in the Michigan Constitution and is inconsistent with\n\nMichigan’s historical approach to standing. Therefore, we overrule Lee and its progeny\n\nand hold that Michigan standing jurisprudence should be restored to a limited, prudential\n\napproach that is consistent with Michigan’s long-standing historical approach to standing.\n\nUnder the proper standing doctrine, we further hold that the Court of Appeals erred in\n\ndetermining that plaintiffs lacked standing. Therefore, we reverse and remand to the\n\nCourt of Appeals to address the parties’ remaining issues, including whether plaintiffs\n\nmeet the requirements to bring an action for a declaratory judgment under MCR 2.605.\n\n                      I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Plaintiffs are the Lansing School Education Association (LSEA), the Michigan\n\nand National Education Associations (MEA/NEA), and four teachers who are employed\n\nby defendants, the Lansing School District and the Lansing Board of Education. Each of\n\nthe four teachers alleges that they were physically assaulted in the classroom by a student\n\nwho was in grade six or higher, and each of the incidents was reported to a school\n\nadministrator.1   The students were suspended but not expelled.        Plaintiff Filonczuk\n\nalleges that the assaultive student was returned to her building, but not to her classroom,\n\nand none of the other teachers allege that the student was returned to the same classroom\n\nor school.\n\n       1\n         Cathy Stachwick alleges that a seventh grader threw a leather wristband with\nmetal spikes towards her back, and the wristband bounced off the blackboard and struck\nher in the head. Penny Filonczuk and Ellen Wheeler allege that students in sixth grade or\nhigher intentionally threw chairs at them. Elizabeth Namie alleges that a student in grade\nsix or higher intentionally slapped her back.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f       Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that defendants failed to comply with their mandatory\n\nduty under MCL 380.1311a(1) to expel students who physically assault a teacher.2 They\n\nsought a writ of mandamus and declaratory and injunctive relief. In support of the\n\naction, three of the teachers filed affidavits stating that they believe that failing to expel\n\nstudents who physically assault a teacher increases the likelihood of other assaults and\n\nthreatens the safety of the school environment. Plaintiff Filonczuk further stated that she\n\nfelt discomfort due to the student’s return to her building, and the other two teachers\n\nstated that they would have felt unsafe if the students who assaulted them had returned to\n\ntheir buildings.\n\n       Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that plaintiffs lack standing,\n\nthe statute does not create a private cause of action, and plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter\n\nof law because the school district did not abuse its discretionary authority in determining\n\nthat none of the students had committed an “assault.” The trial court granted the motion,\n\nreasoning that the court lacked authority to supervise the school district’s exercise of its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s grant of\n\nsummary disposition on different grounds. 282 Mich App 165; 772 NW2d 784 (2009).\n\nThe Court concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing under Lee and did not reach the\n\n\n       2\n         MCL 380.1311a(1) provides in relevant part that “[i]f a pupil enrolled in grade 6\nor above commits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged\nas a volunteer or contractor by the school board,” and the assault is reported to the school,\nthen the school board “shall expel the pupil from the school district permanently . . . .”\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fcase’s merits. This Court granted plaintiffs’ application for leave to appeal. 485 Mich\n\n966 (2009).\n\n                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n       The issue in this case is whether the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority erred in\n\nadopting a standing doctrine that departed dramatically from Michigan’s historical\n\napproach to standing. We hold that they did and that Michigan’s standing doctrine\n\nshould be restored to an approach that is consistent with the limited, prudential approach\n\nused historically. Under this approach, plaintiffs do not lack standing.\n\n                       A. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT\n                      OF MICHIGAN’S STANDING DOCTRINE\n\n       The purpose of the standing doctrine is to assess whether a litigant’s interest in the\n\nissue is sufficient to “ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy.” Detroit Fire Fighters\n\nAss’n v Detroit, 449 Mich 629, 633; 537 NW2d 436 (1995). Thus, the standing inquiry\n\nfocuses on whether a litigant “is a proper party to request adjudication of a particular\n\nissue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable.” Allstate Ins Co v Hayes, 442 Mich\n\n56, 68; 499 NW2d 743 (1993) (quotation marks and citations omitted). This doctrine has\n\ndeep roots in Michigan law, and, although it has been used with increasing frequency in\n\nmodern jurisprudence, before Lee it remained a limited, prudential doctrine.\n\n       Historically, the standing doctrine grew out of cases where parties were seeking\n\nwrits of mandamus to compel a public officer to perform a statutory duty. See, e.g.,\n\nPeople ex rel Ayres v Bd of State Auditors, 42 Mich 422, 429-430; 4 NW 274 (1880);\n\nPeople ex rel Drake v University of Mich Regents, 4 Mich 98, 101-102 (1856). Standing\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fwas a prudential limit, which is to say that the court’s decision to invoke it was “one of\n\ndiscretion and not of law.” Ayres, 42 Mich at 429. See, also, Toan v McGinn, 271 Mich\n\n28, 33-34; 260 NW 108 (1935); Thompson v Secretary of State, 192 Mich 512, 522; 159\n\nNW 65 (1916); Drake, 4 Mich at 103. The general rule was that a court would not hear a\n\ncase where “an individual citizen, who is only interested in common with all other\n\ncitizens of the state in the subject matter of [the] complaint,” was suing a public entity to\n\nforce compliance with a legal duty. Drake, 4 Mich at 101-102. Generally, the court\n\nexercised its discretion to hear a case if the citizen had “some individual interest in the\n\nsubject matter of [the] complaint which is not common to all the citizens of the\n\nstate . . . .” Id. at 103. This was sometimes articulated as a special or specific injury or\n\ninterest. Inglis v Pub Sch Employees Retirement Bd, 374 Mich 10, 13; 131 NW2d 54\n\n(1964); Hastings Bd of Ed v Gilleland, 191 Mich 276, 278; 157 NW 609 (1916); Brophy\n\nv Schindler, 126 Mich 341, 347; 85 NW 1114 (1901).\n\n       This rule was eventually applied in other cases where a party sought enforcement\n\nof a public right without a clear cause of action under the law, including where a plaintiff\n\nwas seeking an injunction against a state agency on the basis that the agency’s actions\n\nwere unconstitutional. Home Tel Co v Michigan R Comm, 174 Mich 219, 223-226; 140\n\nNW 496 (1913). See, also, Gilleland, 191 Mich at 278, listing remedies to which the rule\n\nhad been extended. Notably, these cases only discussed the doctrine when no cause of\n\naction was clearly provided under law and the Court was deciding whether, within its\n\ndiscretion, to allow the party to bring the claim despite the lack of an express cause of\n\naction. Further, the standing inquiry was distinct from the merits of the case. Thus,\n\n\n                                             5\n\falthough the Court sometimes reached the merits of a case despite concluding that a party\n\nlacked standing, the Court did not find it necessary to determine whether a party’s claim\n\nhad merit in order to determine whether a party had standing.\n\n       References to standing became more frequent in Michigan’s modern\n\njurisprudence, and the doctrine was developed more extensively but remained a\n\nprudential limit that could, within the Court’s discretion, be ignored.3 Further, the fact\n\nthat there was a cause of action under law, or the Legislature expressly conferred\n\nstanding, was sufficient to establish standing.4 Where a party was seeking declaratory\n\nrelief, the Court repeatedly held that meeting the requirements of the court rule governing\n\ndeclaratory actions was sufficient to establish standing. House Speaker v Governor, 443\n\nMich 560, 572-573; 506 NW2d 190 (1993); Allstate, 442 Mich at 69-70; Sloan v\n\n\n       3\n          See Detroit City Council v Mayor of Detroit, 449 Mich 670, 679 n 10; 537\nNW2d 177 (1995), stating that the Court was not reaching the standing issue because the\nparties did not raise or brief it; People v Kevorkian, 447 Mich 436, 447 n 1; 527 NW2d\n714 (1994) (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J., and BRICKLEY and GRIFFIN, JJ.), noting that it\nwas not addressing standing because the parties had not raised it; Auto Club Ins Ass’n v\nFrederick & Herrud, Inc (After Remand), 443 Mich 358, 371-372; 505 NW2d 820\n(1993), noting that federal courts had split on whether subrogees had standing to sue\nunder a federal act but the Court would permit a subrogee to sue “as a matter of public\npolicy”; Blue Cross & Blue Shield v Governor, 422 Mich 1, 103 n 6; 367 NW2d 1 (1985)\n(opinion by LEVIN, J.), deciding to give a decision on the merits regardless of whether the\nplaintiff had standing because “this litigation has been pending for a number of years and\nthe Legislature and the people need a decision . . . .”\n       4\n        See, generally, Nemeth v Abonmarche Dev, Inc, 457 Mich 16, 45; 576 NW2d\n641 (1998) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), discussing the historical importance and validity\nof the Michigan environmental protection act’s citizen-standing provision. See, also,\nWalterhouse v Ackley, 459 Mich 924 (1998); Frame v Nehls, 452 Mich 171, 177-178;\n550 NW2d 739 (1996).\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fMadison Hts, 425 Mich 288, 294-295; 389 NW2d 418 (1986). See, also, East Grand\n\nRapids Sch Dist v Kent Co Tax Allocation Bd, 415 Mich 381, 392-395; 330 NW2d 7\n\n(1982); Workman v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, 404 Mich 477, 492 n 1; 274 NW2d 373\n\n(1979); Shavers v Attorney General, 402 Mich 554, 588-592; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). The\n\nCourt also reaffirmed that “[s]tanding does not address the ultimate merits of the\n\nsubstantive claims of the parties.” Detroit Fire Fighters Ass’n, 449 Mich at 633 (opinion\n\nby WEAVER, J.). See also Eide v Kelsey-Hayes Co, 431 Mich 26, 50 n 16; 427 NW2d\n\n488 (1988) (opinion by GRIFFIN, J), treating standing as an inquiry that was distinct from\n\nwhether the plaintiff’s requested remedy was available.\n\n      While the doctrine continued to serve the purpose of ensuring “sincere and\n\nvigorous advocacy” by litigants, over time the test for satisfying this requirement was\n\nfurther developed.   In cases involving public rights, the Court held that a litigant\n\nestablished standing by demonstrating a “substantial interest [that] will be detrimentally\n\naffected in a manner different from the citizenry at large.” House Speaker, 443 Mich at\n\n572 (quotation marks and citations omitted).         Additionally, however, the Court\n\nrecognized that even if a statute did not expressly grant standing, it could be implied\n\nfrom duties created by law. See Romulus City Treasurer v Wayne Co Drain Comm’r,\n\n413 Mich 728, 741; 322 NW2d 152 (1982), stating that there were cases in which\n\n“standing was not expressly granted by statute [but] standing was implied by the duties\n\nand obligations that were expressly stated.” Thus, where a statute did not expressly grant\n\nstanding, this Court would consider whether the Legislature nonetheless intended to\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fconfer standing on the plaintiffs.5 Bradley v Saranac Bd of Ed, 455 Mich 285, 296; 565\n\nNW2d 650 (1997); Bowie v Arder, 441 Mich 23, 42; 490 NW2d 568 (1992); Girard v\n\nWagenmaker, 437 Mich 231, 235; 470 NW2d 372 (1991); Shavers, 402 Mich at 587. In\n\na case involving private rights, the Court explained that the litigant should have “some\n\nreal interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title, or interest in the\n\nsubject matter of the controversy.” Bowie, 441 Mich at 42 (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).\n\n       In summary, standing historically developed in Michigan as a limited, prudential\n\ndoctrine that was intended to “ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy” by litigants. If a\n\nparty had a cause of action under law, then standing was not an issue. But where a cause\n\nof action was not provided at law, the Court, in its discretion, would consider whether a\n\nlitigant had standing based on a special injury or right or substantial interest that would\n\nbe detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large, or because, in\n\nthe context of a statutory scheme, the Legislature had intended to confer standing on the\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Although the Court splintered on how to articulate when standing could be\nimplied from a statutory scheme that does not expressly grant standing in the last major\npre-Lee case addressing this issue, Detroit Fire Fighters Ass’n, Justice WEAVER’s lead\nopinion articulated general principles consistent with the historical approach. 449 Mich\nat 633. Further, Justice MALLETT’s statement that the key issue is “whether the plaintiff\ncan demonstrate any special right, injury, or zone of interest that deserves the protections\nof the law,” is consistent with the historical doctrine. 449 Mich at 663 (MALLETT, J.,\nconcurring in the result only). Justice RILEY’s concurrence, however, erred in conflating\nthe distinct inquiries of whether a plaintiff has standing under a statutory scheme and\nwhether there is an implied statutory cause of action. 449 Mich at 644-645.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\flitigant. It was not necessary to address the merits of the case in order to address\n\nstanding.\n\n             B. THE LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS STANDING DOCTRINE\n\n      Despite the consistency of the historical development of the standing doctrine in\n\nMichigan, Lee and its progeny abruptly departed from precedent and radically changed\n\nthe standing doctrine. This doctrine’s flaws are many.\n\n                 1. OVERVIEW OF THE LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS\n                     MAJORITY’S APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n      In Lee, a majority of the Court determined, for the first time in Michigan\n\njurisprudence, that standing was required by the Michigan Constitution, and, further, that\n\nMichigan’s standing doctrine should be abandoned in favor of the standing doctrine\n\nadopted by the United States Supreme Court in the context of the federal constitution.\n\nThe reasoning presented in Lee, and expanded in Cleveland Cliffs, is that standing is\n\nessential to Michigan’s separation of powers doctrine. See Lee, 464 Mich at 735. The\n\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs majority explained that Article III, § 1 of the federal constitution\n\ngrants federal courts only the “judicial power” and Article III, § 2 limits the judicial\n\npower to certain “Cases” or “Controversies.” Lee, 464 Mich at 735. Although the\n\nMichigan Constitution does not include “Cases” or “Controversies” requirements, the\n\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs majority concluded that the Michigan Constitution is analogous to\n\nthe federal constitution because it expressly requires the separation of powers and grants\n\ncourts only the judicial power. Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at 615; Lee, 464 Mich at 737-\n\n738. The majority further determined that the cornerstone of the judicial power is the\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fcase-or-controversy requirement. Id.6 The Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority thus concluded\n\nthat Michigan should adopt the federal constitutional standing test from Lujan v\n\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 US 555, 560; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992), as the\n\n“irreducible constitutional minimum of standing . . . .”7\n\n       The Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority also held that a litigant must meet the Lujan\n\nstanding requirements regardless of whether the Legislature expressly created a cause of\n\naction or conferred standing on the litigant because, although the Legislature has the\n\npower to create causes of actions, it does not have the power to expand the judicial\n\nauthority granted to the courts by the Michigan Constitution. See Mich Citizens for\n\nWater Conservation v Nestlé Waters North America Inc, 479 Mich 280, 302-303; 737\n\nNW2d 447 (2007). The Court also held that a litigant must meet Lujan’s requirements in\n\norder to bring a declaratory action. Associated Builders & Contractors v Dep’t of\n\n\n       6\n        Lee cited older Michigan caselaw to define the judicial power as “the power to\nhear and determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in litigation,”\nand “the authority to hear and decide controversies, and to make binding orders and\njudgments respecting them.” 464 Mich at 738, quoting Daniels v People, 6 Mich 381,\n388 (1859), and Risser v Hoyt, 53 Mich 185, 193; 18 NW 611 (1884) (emphasis omitted).\nThe Cleveland Cliffs majority, however, only cited federal caselaw in support of its\ncontention that “[p]erhaps the most critical element of the ‘judicial power’ has been its\nrequirement of a genuine case or controversy between the parties . . . .” Cleveland Cliffs,\n471 Mich at 615.\n       7\n           The test requires that the plaintiff show (1) an injury-in-fact, meaning the\n“invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b)\nactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; (2) causality, meaning that the\ninjury is “fairly trace[able]” to the challenged conduct; and (3) redressability, meaning\nthat it is “likely” that a favorable decision would “redress” the injury.

Thus,\n\nafter Lee and its progeny, little remained of the historical limited, prudential approach to\n\nstanding, and the doctrine was significantly expanded.\n\n           2. CRITICISMS OF THE LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS MAJORITY’S\n                          APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n       The flaws in the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs approach are many.8             Perhaps most\n\negregiously, however, the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority dramatically distorted Michigan\n\njurisprudence to invent out of whole cloth a constitutional basis for the standing doctrine\n\nand then, perplexingly, determined that Michigan’s standing doctrine should be\n\nessentially coterminous with the federal doctrine, despite the significant differences\n\nbetween the two constitutions and the powers held by the respective court systems.\n\nThere is no support in either the text of the Michigan Constitution or in Michigan\n\njurisprudence, however, for recognizing standing as a constitutional requirement or for\n\nadopting the federal standing doctrine.\n\n       To begin with, there is no textual basis in the Michigan Constitution for\n\nconcluding that standing is constitutionally required, and there are important differences\n\nbetween the two constitutions. The Michigan Constitution provides for the separation of\n\npowers between the legislative, judicial, and executive branches and vests the courts with\n\n\n       8\n         Only the fundamental legal error most relevant to the stare decisis analysis will\nbe reviewed because other criticisms have been thoroughly addressed in various opinions\nin this Court. For further discussion, however, see, e.g., Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at\n651-675, (WEAVER, J., concurring); Mich Citizens for Water Conservation, 479 Mich at\n310-322 (WEAVER, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\fthe judicial power. Const 1963, art 3, § 2; art 6, § 1. The federal constitution similarly\n\nvests the judicial power in the courts. US Const, art III, § 1. Unlike the Michigan\n\nConstitution, however, the federal constitution enumerates the cases and controversies to\n\nwhich the judicial power extends, and the federal standing doctrine is largely derived\n\nfrom this art III case-or-controversy requirement. See Lujan, 504 US at 560, stating that\n\n“the core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.” Additionally, strictly interpreting the judicial\n\npower of Michigan courts to be identical to the federal court’s judicial power does not\n\nreflect the broader power held by state courts. Whereas federal courts only have the\n\npowers enumerated in the United States Constitution, the states retain powers not ceded\n\nto the federal government. US Const, Am X. See also Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at\n\n683-684 (KELLY, J., concurring). As this Court has stated, in Michigan, “[w]hile the\n\nlegislature obtains legislative power and the courts receive judicial power by grant in the\n\nState Constitution, the whole of such power reposing in the sovereignty is granted to\n\nthose bodies except as it may be restricted in the same instrument.”9 Washington-Detroit\n\nTheatre Co v Moore, 249 Mich 673, 680; 229 NW 618 (1930). Given that the text of the\n\nMichigan Constitution lacks an express basis for importing the federal case-or-\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          As noted in Justice WEAVER’s Cleveland Cliffs concurring opinion, and\ndiscussed in her concurrence in this case, adopting standing as a constitutional doctrine\npotentially may even violate the separation of powers doctrine under the Michigan\nConstitution. 471 Mich at 668-669.\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fcontroversy requirement into Michigan law, the justification for doing so, if one can be\n\nfound, must lie elsewhere.\n\n       The Cleveland Cliffs majority dismissed the lack of a textual case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement in the Michigan Constitution as irrelevant because it held that the case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement is a limitation inherent in the judicial power.10 However, even\n\nassuming arguendo that the judicial power implicitly extends only to cases or\n\ncontroversies, there is no basis for rejecting the understanding Michigan courts\n\ntraditionally had of this power to instead give it the same meaning it has in the very\n\ndifferent context of the federal constitution. This conclusion is certainly not required by\n\nfederal law, as the United States Supreme Court has “recognized often that the\n\nconstraints of Article III do not apply to state courts, and accordingly the state courts are\n\nnot bound by the limitations of a case or controversy or other federal rules of\n\njusticiability . . . .” ASARCO Inc v Kadish, 490 US 605, 617; 109 S Ct 2037; 104 L Ed\n\n2d 696 (1989).11 There is also no basis for doing so in Michigan law, as this Court long\n\n\n       10\n          The Cleveland Cliffs majority dismissed the cases or controversies requirements\nin art III, § 2 of the federal constitution as merely explaining the types of cases and\ncontroversies over which the Court had jurisdiction, rather than as the source of the case-\nor-controversy requirement itself, which it considered to be inherent in the grant of\njudicial power in art III, § 1. 471 Mich at 626-627.\n       11\n           As the dissent notes, some of our sister states have chosen to adopt a standing\ndoctrine similar to the Lujan test. But, of course, other state’s courts’ interpretations of\ntheir own constitutions are not binding or even necessarily instructive to our\ninterpretation of the Michigan Constitution. Furthermore, many states have either\ndeclined to adopt the Lujan standing test or do not apply it exclusively. See, e.g., Kellas\nv Dep’t of Corrections, 341 Or 471, 478; 145 P3d 139 (2006), noting that “[t]he Oregon\nConstitution contains no ‘cases’ or ‘controversies’ provision” and declining to “import\n\n\n                                             13\n\fago explained that Michigan courts’ judicial power to decide controversies was broader\n\nthan the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the art III case-or-controversy\n\nlimits on the federal judicial power because a state sovereign possesses inherent powers\n\nthat the federal government does not. Washington-Detroit Theatre Co, 249 Mich at 679-\n\n680.12\n\n\nfederal law regarding justiciability into our analysis of the Oregon Constitution and rely\non it to fabricate constitutional barriers to litigation with no support in either the text or\nhistory of Oregon’s charter of government.” See also Coalition for Adequacy & Fairness\nin School Funding, Inc v Chiles, 680 So 2d 400, 403 (Fla, 1996), holding that a citizen\ntaxpayer has standing to challenge the legislature’s exercise of its taxing and spending\npower without demonstrating a special injury and stating that “in Florida, unlike the\nfederal system, the doctrine of standing has not been rigidly followed”; Lebron v Gottlieb\nMem Hosp, 2010 Ill LEXIS 26, *52 (Ill, 2010), explaining that “[t]his court is not\nrequired to follow federal law on issues of standing, and has expressly rejected federal\nprinciples of standing”; Nefedro v Montgomery Co 2010 Md LEXIS 210, *8 n 3 (Md,\n2010), explaining that the Lujan standing doctrine did not apply because it “is not\napplicable to state courts”; Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts v Comm’r of Revenue,\n423 Mass 708, 714; 672 NE2d 504, (1996), explaining that under Massachusetts’s\n“public right doctrine,” a citizen has standing to “seek relief in the nature of mandamus to\ncompel the performance of a duty required by law”; Jen Electric, Inc v Co of Essex, 197\nNJ 627, 645; 964 A2d 790 (2009), explaining that, in New Jersey, “[s]tanding is a\ncreature of the common law” and a “liberal rule[]” because “overall we have given due\nweight to the interests of individual justice, along with the public interest, always bearing\nin mind that throughout our law we have been sweepingly rejecting procedural\nfrustrations in favor of just and expeditious determinations on the ultimate merits.”\n(Quotation marks and citations omitted.)\n         12\n          The dissent offers quotations from delegates to the Michigan Constitutional\nConvention to support its position that the judicial power extends only to cases or\ncontroversies. Even setting aside whether there is a truly logical distinction between the\ndissent’s criticisms of the use of legislative history to interpret a statute and its use of a\ndelegate’s preenactment impressions of constitutional text to interpret that text, these\nquotations provide no support that any delegate believed that standing was a\nconstitutional requirement. They merely demonstrate that certain delegates believed that\nthe judicial power extended to cases and controversies, which, at that time, had never\nbeen interpreted to incorporate standing as a constitutional requirement in Michigan.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       Most importantly, however, not only does the federal standing jurisprudence have\n\nno basis in Michigan law, it is contrary to it. As explained above, before Lee, the\n\nstanding doctrine was not treated as a constitutional requirement in Michigan\n\njurisprudence; that is, the Court never concluded that a lack of standing equated to the\n\nlack of a controversy necessary for the invocation of the judicial power under the\n\nMichigan Constitution. As discussed, before Lee, from the doctrine’s inception this\n\nCourt has at times addressed a case’s merits despite concluding that the parties lacked\n\nstanding. And, more generally, before Lee, “controversy” was never interpreted, as it is\n\nunder Lujan, to refer only to instances where the party suffered a concrete and\n\nparticularized injury caused directly by the challenged conduct. Thus, the Michigan\n\nConstitution does not compel adoption of the federal standing doctrine, and there is no\n\nsupport for doing so in this Court’s historical jurisprudence.\n\n       Indeed, the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority, and the dissent in this case, make\n\nunsupported logical, or, rather, illogical, leaps.       They expend significant energy\n\nexplaining that Michigan law has historically required a case or a controversy to invoke\n\nthe judicial power. See, e.g., Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at 626-628. Then, citing only\n\ncases that stand for that limited proposition, and without distinguishing or overruling the\n\nvolume of precedent discussed in this opinion, they conclude that simply because this\n\nCourt has stated that the judicial power extends to cases and controversies, standing is\n\ntherefore required by the Michigan Constitution and must be equivalent to the federal\n\nstanding doctrine adopted in Lujan.       Id. at 628-629.    They utterly fail to explain,\n\nhowever, why decades of Michigan standing jurisprudence must be sacrificed on the altar\n\n\n                                             15\n\fof the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the federal case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement, despite the lack of support in Michigan caselaw for understanding a\n\n“controversy” to exist only in the same, limited circumstances explained in Lujan and\n\ndespite the conflict with Michigan’s historic approach to standing.\n\n                                   C. STARE DECISIS\n\n       In light of the fact that the Michigan Constitution’s reference to the judicial power\n\ndoes not inherently incorporate the federal case-or-controversy requirement, and, in fact,\n\nimporting this requirement is inconsistent with this Court’s historical view of its own\n\npowers and the scope of the standing doctrine, the question arises as to whether this\n\nCourt should continue to apply the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs doctrine.          Under the long-\n\nstanding doctrine of stare decisis, “principles of law deliberately examined and decided\n\nby a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.” Brown v Manistee\n\nCo Rd Comm, 452 Mich 354, 365; 550 NW2d 215 (1996) (quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).   The importance of the stare decisis doctrine is well-established, for, as\n\nAlexander Hamilton stated, to “‘avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is\n\nindispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which\n\nserve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before\n\nthem . . . .’” Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 314-315; 773 NW2d 564 (2009)\n\n(opinion by KELLY, C.J.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander Hamilton)\n\n(Clinton Rossiter ed, 1961). As the United States Supreme Court has stated, the doctrine\n\n“promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles,\n\nfosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity\n\n\n                                             16\n\fof the judicial process.” Payne v Tennessee, 501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed\n\n2d 720 (1991).\n\n       Despite its importance, stare decisis is neither an “inexorable command,”\n\nLawrence v Texas, 539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003), nor “a\n\nmechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision . . . .” Helvering v Hallock, 309\n\nUS 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940). Ultimately, it “attempts to balance two\n\ncompeting considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and\n\ndecisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 314\n\n(opinion by KELLY, C.J.). To reflect this balance, while there is a presumption in favor\n\nof upholding precedent, this presumption may be rebutted if there is a special or\n\ncompelling justification to overturn precedent. Id. at 319-320. In determining whether a\n\nspecial or compelling justification exists, a number of evaluative criteria may be relevant,\n\nid.,13 but overturning precedent requires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly\n\ndecided. See Brown, 452 Mich at 365.14\n\n\n       13\n         In Petersen, Chief Justice KELLY provided a nonexhaustive list of criteria that\nmay be considered, but none of the criteria are determinative, and they need only be\nevaluated if relevant. See Petersen, 484 Mich at 320.\n       14\n          In addition to firing its standard shot impugning my commitment to the doctrine\nof stare decisis, today the dissent also claims that the justices of this Court must adopt a\nuniform approach to stare decisis and criticizes me for applying a “minority” approach\nrather than Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439, 464-466; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). As\ndiscussed in concurrences by Justice WEAVER and Justice HATHAWAY, however, justices\nmay take varying approaches to stare decisis. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court\nhas not applied one strict standard or a single “commonly accepted test,” post at __, when\nconsidering stare decisis issues and has applied various approaches, even within the same\nyear. For example, in Montejo v Louisiana, ___ US ___, ___; 129 S Ct 2079, 2088-2089;\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       In this case, the question is whether there is a special or compelling justification to\n\noverrule the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority’s decision to dramatically depart from this\n\nCourt’s deeply rooted standing doctrine. We hold that there is.\n\n       To begin with, a case may be given less deference when it was an abrupt departure\n\nfrom long-standing precedent and lacks a constitutional basis. Adarand Constructors,\n\nInc v Pena, 515 US 200, 231-234; 115 S Ct 2097; 132 L Ed 2d 158 (1995). In such\n\ncases, “[b]y refusing to follow [the erroneous precedent], then, we do not depart from the\n\nfabric of the law; we restore it.” Id. at 233-234. As discussed, Lee and its progeny\n\ndeparted dramatically from historical jurisprudence in Michigan, and the bounds of the\n\nconstitutional text, when they interpreted the Michigan Constitution to compel a standing\n\n\n173 L Ed 2d 955, 967 (2009), in an opinion authored by Justice Scalia, the Court\nexplained that “the fact that a decision has proved ‘unworkable’ is a traditional ground\nfor overruling it.” The Court also stated that other relevant factors include “the antiquity\nof the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was\nwell reasoned.” Yet, in Pearson v Callahan, ___ US ___, ___; 129 S Ct 808, 816; 172 L\nEd 2d 565, 574 (2009), in an unanimous opinion authored by Justice Alito, the Court\nstated that “[r]evisiting precedent is particularly appropriate where . . . a departure would\nnot upset expectations, the precedent consists of a judge-made rule that was recently\nadopted to improve the operation of the courts, and experience has pointed up the\nprecedent’s shortcomings.”\n\n       Ironically, the very doctrine and approach that the dissent claims to vehemently\nadhere to today was not so faithfully applied by the members of the dissent in the past.\nIndeed, the members of the dissent have overruled caselaw without even paying lip\nservice to Robinson, see, e.g., People v Anstey, 476 Mich 436; 719 NW2d 579 (2006), or\nafter engaging in a cursory, or limited, analysis of the factors that they claim fidelity to\ntoday. See, e.g., Wesche v Mecosta Co Rd Comm, 480 Mich 75, 91 n 13; 746 NW2d 847\n(2008); Al-Shimmari v Detroit Med Ctr, 477 Mich 280, 297 n 10; 731 NW2d 29 (2007);\nNeal v Wilkes, 470 Mich 661, 667 n 8; 685 NW2d 648 (2004); People v Hickman, 470\nMich 602, 610 n 6; 684 NW2d 267 (2004); Mack v Detroit, 467 Mich 186, 203 n 19; 649\nNW2d 47 (2002).\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fdoctrine that is essentially coterminous with the federal standing doctrine. Thus, by\n\nreinstating the decades-old precedent from which Lee departed, we are restoring, not\n\ndeparting from, the fabric of the law and this Court’s fidelity to the Michigan\n\nConstitution.15\n\n       Further, regardless of the level of deference due Lee and Cleveland Cliffs, there is\n\na compelling justification to overrule the standing doctrine adopted in those cases. I find\n\nseveral evaluative criteria to be relevant, including: (1) “whether the rule has proven to\n\nbe intolerable because it defies practical workability”; (2) “whether reliance on the rule is\n\nsuch that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity”; (3) “whether\n\nupholding the rule is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests”;\n\nand (4) “whether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from\n\nprecedent.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 320. 16\n\n\n\n\n       15\n           Contrary to the mewling of the dissenters, who would enshrine their\ndisembowelment of 10 to 50 years of this Court’s jurisprudence, in Lee and many other\ncases, this majority’s reversal of their recent activist efforts simply brings this Court back\nto the status quo ante. Indeed, the dissenters’ stare decisis protestations should taste like\nashes in their mouths. Although the dissenters paid absolutely no heed to stare decisis as\nthey denigrated the wisdom of innumerable predecessors, the dissenters would now wrap\nthemselves in its benefits to save their recent precedent.\n       16\n          The other criteria suggested by Chief Justice KELLY in Petersen are not\napplicable to this case or are neutral. For example, perhaps because the case was recently\ndecided, there are no related principles of law that have eroded the rule and there are no\nsignificant changed facts or circumstances. Further, as noted, the jurisprudence from\nother states and jurisdictions has limited value because it is based on distinct\njurisprudential history and constitutions, and, regardless, there are states that have\nfollowed Lujan and there are states that have rejected it.\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f       The first criterion weighs slightly in favor of affirming the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs\n\nstanding doctrine because, although confusion sometimes arises over the application of\n\nthe factors, the test does not rise to the level of defying practical workability.\n\n       The second criterion, the strength of reliance on the rule, weighs in favor of\n\noverruling Lee and Cleveland Cliffs because it seems unlikely that potential future\n\ndefendants, including the government, have been violating laws on the basis of the\n\nassumption it could not be challenged because no party would have standing under Lee to\n\ndo so. To the extent that such interests exist, they are not the type of reliance interests\n\nthat this Court seeks to protect.\n\n       The third criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling Lee because the doctrine\n\nis likely to result in serious detriment to the public interest. The purpose of the standing\n\ndoctrine in Michigan has always been to “ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy.” But\n\nthe Lee/Cleveland Cliffs standing doctrine is, at the expense of the public interest,\n\nbroader than this purpose because it may prevent litigants from enforcing public rights,\n\ndespite the presence of adverse interests and parties, and regardless of whether the\n\nLegislature intended a private right of enforcement to be part of the statute’s enforcement\n\nscheme.     As noted by Chief Justice KELLY’s Cleveland Cliffs concurrence, the\n\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs standing doctrine “creates a self-inflicted wound” that prevents the\n\nCourt from serving justice and protecting the public interest. 471 Mich at 689. Further,\n\nas many commentators have noted, the federal standing doctrine has the effect of\n\nencouraging courts to decide the merits of a case under the guise of merely deciding that\n\nthe plaintiff lacks standing, thus using “standing to slam the courthouse door against\n\n\n                                              20\n\fplaintiffs who are entitled to full consideration of their claims on the merits.” Valley\n\nForge Christian College v Americans United for Separation of Church & State, 454 US\n\n464, 490; 102 S Ct 752; 70 L Ed 2d 700 (1982) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).17 Thus, the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs standing doctrine is overly\n\nbroad compared to the doctrine’s historical purpose and development and unjustifiably\n\n“slams the courthouse door” on numerous controversies that present legitimately adverse\n\nparties and interests.\n\n       Finally, the fourth criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling precedent\n\nbecause, as discussed above, by adopting the Lujan test as a constitutionally required\n\nstanding doctrine, the majority casually displaced decades of inconsistent precedent\n\nwithout notice or adequate explanation and thus implemented an abrupt and insufficiently\n\nexplained departure from precedent.\n\n       In light of these considerations, we hold that Lee and its progeny should be\n\noverruled.18\n\n\n       17\n         See, e.g., Allen v Wright, 468 US 737, 782; 104 S Ct 3315; 82 L Ed 2d 556\n(1984) (Brennan, J., dissenting), quoting numerous academic commentaries to explain\nthat “[m]ore than one commentator has noted that the causation component of the Court’s\nstanding inquiry is no more than a poor disguise for the Court’s view of the merits of the\nunderlying claims.” Indeed, there is perhaps no better example of this then the dissenting\nopinion in this case, which, in order to apply the Lee standing test, also voluminously\naddressed the merits of each of plaintiffs’ claims and the availability of the remedies they\nsought.\n       18\n        The cases extending or applying Lee and Cleveland Cliffs include: Rohde v Ann\nArbor Pub Sch, 479 Mich 336; 737 NW2d 158 (2007); Mich Citizens for Water\nConservation; Mich Chiropractic Council v Comm’r of the Office of Fin & Ins Servs, 475\nMich 363; 716 NW2d 561 (2006). Further, Associated Builders & Contractors, 472\n\n\n                                            21\n\f                       D. THE PROPER STANDING DOCTRINE\n\n            1. OVERVIEW OF THE PROPER APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n       The question then becomes what standing doctrine this Court should adopt in lieu\n\nof Lee/Cleveland Cliffs.     We hold that Michigan standing jurisprudence should be\n\nrestored to a limited, prudential doctrine that is consistent with Michigan’s long-standing\n\nhistorical approach to standing.19 Under this approach, a litigant has standing whenever\n\nthere is a legal cause of action. Further, whenever a litigant meets the requirements of\n\nMCR 2.605, it is sufficient to establish standing to seek a declaratory judgment.20 Where\n\na cause of action is not provided at law, then a court should, in its discretion, determine\n\nwhether a litigant has standing. A litigant may have standing in this context if the litigant\n\nhas a special injury or right, or substantial interest, that will be detrimentally affected in a\n\nmanner different from the citizenry at large or if the statutory scheme implies that the\n\nLegislature intended to confer standing on the litigant.\n\n\n\nMich at 126-127, is overruled to the extent that it required a litigant to establish the\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs standing requirements in order to bring an action under MCR 2.605.\n       19\n         The dissent’s Chicken Little-esque wails of the impending stampede to the\ncourthouse that will result from today’s decision ignore that we do nothing more than\nrestore an approach to standing that is consistent with the approach that this Court\nfollowed for decades without courts being overburdened with a flood of litigation before\nLee was decided a mere nine years ago.\n       20\n          The pre-Lee/Cleveland Cliffs standard, which was also incorporated into\nAssociated Builders & Contractors, remains: “[t]he essential requirement of the term\n‘actual controversy’ under the rule is that plaintiffs ‘plead and prove facts which indicate\nan adverse interest necessitating the sharpening of the issues raised.’” Associated\nBuilders & Contractors, 472 Mich at 126, quoting Shavers, 402 Mich at 589.\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\f            2. APPLICATION OF THE STANDING DOCTRINE TO THIS CASE\n\n       The next question is whether, in this case, plaintiffs have standing. Plaintiffs seek\n\na declaratory judgment, a writ of mandamus, and injunctive relief.21 We hold that\n\nplaintiffs have standing to pursue at least some of their claims.\n\n       To begin with, under the proper approach to standing, plaintiffs may seek a\n\ndeclaratory judgment if the requirements in MCR 2.605 are met. We remand to the\n\nCourt of Appeals to decide whether plaintiffs meet the requirements of MCR 2.605\n\nbecause it did not previously address this issue.\n\n       Further, we must decide whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue the rest of their\n\nclaims because the Revised School Code, MCL 380.1 et seq., does not create an express\n\ncause of action or expressly confer standing on plaintiffs to enforce the act’s provisions.22\n\nWe hold that, in this case, plaintiffs have standing because they have a substantial\n\n\n\n\n       21\n          It is not disputed that, under Michigan law, an organization has standing to\nadvocate for the interests of its members if the members themselves have a sufficient\ninterest. See, e.g., Trout Unlimited, Muskegon-White River Chapter v White Cloud, 195\nMich App 343, 348; 489 NW2d 188 (1992). Thus, because we hold that the plaintiff-\nteachers have standing, and it is not disputed that the plaintiff-teachers are members of\nthe plaintiff-organizations, the plaintiff-organizations have standing as well.\n       22\n          In dicta, the Court of Appeals decision in this case suggested that there is no\nimplied private cause of action to enforce the Revised School Code. We do not reach the\nmerits of that issue, however, because plaintiffs are not seeking a private cause of action\nfor damages. See, generally, Lash v Traverse City, 479 Mich 180, 196-197; 735 NW2d\n628 (2007), explaining that a party may seek remedies other than monetary damages,\nsuch as declaratory relief under MCR 2.605(A)(1), against a governmental unit without\nhaving to demonstrate that a statute has an implied private right of action.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\finterest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1) that will be detrimentally affected in a\n\nmanner different from the citizenry at large if the statute is not enforced.\n\n       To begin with, the text of MCL 380.1311a itself suggests that plaintiffs have a\n\nsubstantial and distinct interest. It requires that a qualifying student be expelled for\n\nphysically assaulting an employee of the school, which is defined to include the plaintiff-\n\nteachers. Given that the students are expelled for assaulting employees of the school, and\n\nnot the citizenry at large, it is apparent from the statute that the plaintiff-teachers have a\n\nsubstantial interest in the enforcement of this provision distinct from the general public.\n\nThe members of the general public might never be in a school, and, even for those who\n\nare, an assault on those members would not necessarily lead to the expulsion of the\n\nassaultive student.\n\n       Moreover, the legislative history to the 1999 legislative amendments that adopted\n\nMCL 380.1311a(1) into the Revised School Code make clear that the purpose of the\n\nsection is to create a safer school environment and, even more specifically, a safer and\n\nmore effective working environment for teachers.23 The enrolled analysis of the public\n\n\n       23\n          The dissent suggests that the same limitations that apply to using legislative\nhistory to interpret a statute should be applied to determining whether a party has a\nsubstantial and distinct interest in the statute’s enforcement that is sufficient to establish\nstanding. We disagree. If the Legislature unambiguously expresses an intent to confer\nstanding through a statute’s text, then it would certainly be sufficient to confer standing.\nBut the inquiry into whether a party has a substantial and distinct interest in the\nenforcement of the statute is a much broader inquiry for which legislative history may be\ninstructive. Indeed, before Lee, this Court would sometimes consider legislative history\nin determining whether a party had standing. See, e.g., Frame v Nehls, 452 Mich 171,\n176-180; 550 NW2d 739 (1996); Girard, 437 Mich at 244-247. Further, while analyzing\nlegislative intent is essential if a party is attempting to demonstrate that the Legislature\n\n\n                                             24\n\fact adopting the amendments explained that the rationale for their enactment is that “[i]n\n\nMichigan, school safety is an ongoing concern,” and, although an earlier public act\n\n“addresses several aspects of school violence, additional concerns remain,” and “[i]n\n\nparticular, it has been suggested that students should be expelled or suspended when they\n\nphysically or verbally assault teachers or other school personnel . . . .” Enrolled Senate\n\nFiscal Agency Analysis of SB 183, SB 206, HB 4240, and HB 4241, July 21, 1999. The\n\nanalysis explains that the arguments in favor of the act included that “additional measures\n\nare necessary to create and maintain a safe educational environment” because “[t]eachers\n\nwho are subject to student assaults cannot effectively teach, and pupils who feel\n\nendangered cannot learn.” (Emphasis added.) It further explained that “[s]ince just one\n\nmiscreant can disrupt an entire classroom, and a handful can ruin the atmosphere of a\n\nschool, removing these individuals will promote efforts to educate and to learn, as well as\n\nprotect the physical safety of school personnel and students” and concluded by\n\nexplaining that “[a] comprehensive State approach toward student violence should deter\n\nfuture assaults and other disciplinary problems.” (Emphasis added.) In other words, the\n\nlegislative history of the act indicates that the intended purposes of MCL 380.1311a(1)\n\nare exactly what common sense would suggest based on the statutory text: to make the\n\nschool and classroom environment safer in general and specifically to protect teachers’\n\n\nintended to confer standing or create a private right that the party would have standing to\nenforce, this Court has not historically found an analysis of legislative intent necessary\nfor a party to demonstrate that the party has a substantial interest in the enforcement of a\nstatute relating to a public right that is distinct from that of the general public. See, e.g.,\nHouse Speaker v State Admin Bd, 441 Mich 547; 495 NW2d 539 (1993).\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\fphysical safety and their ability to effectively teach by removing miscreants and assisting\n\nin deterring future assaults. The plaintiffs-teachers’ affidavits indicate that, consistent\n\nwith these purposes, the alleged failure of the school board to comply with the statute\n\nincreases the threat to their safety.\n\n       In light of these purposes, and the plaintiffs-teachers’ affidavits, it is even more\n\nclear that teachers have a substantial interest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1)\n\nthat is distinct from that of the general public.        The legislative history specifically\n\ncontemplates that the statute is intended to not only make the general school environment\n\nsafer but additionally to specifically protect teachers from assault and to assist them in\n\nmore effectively performing their jobs. These are hardly interests that are shared by the\n\ngeneral public. 24 Thus, teachers who work in a public school have a significant interest\n\ndistinct from that of the general public in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n       24\n           Indeed, because of this, plaintiffs’ claim to having a more substantial interest\nthan that of the general public is greater than that of the firefighter-plaintiffs in Detroit\nFire Fighters Ass’n. In that case, Justice WEAVER’s lead opinion explained, that, in her\nview, firefighters did not have a substantial interest in the effects of reduced funding for\nthe fire department that was sufficiently distinct from that of the general public because,\nalthough firefighters were subject to a greater risk of harm if the number of total\nfirefighters was reduced, members of the public who were trapped in burning houses\nwere also subject to a greater likelihood of injury, and, thus, “[b]oth segments of society\nare at greater risk when there is a dearth of fire fighters.” 449 Mich at 638 (quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Other justices, including myself, would have concluded that\nthe firefighters did have a sufficiently distinct interest to establish standing. But,\nregardless, it is apparent that plaintiffs’ interest in this case is even more distinct than that\nof the firefighters. As noted by the dissent, a teacher is more likely to be at a school, just\nas a firefighter is more likely to be at a fire. But whereas all members of the public are at\nrisk of being in a building that may catch fire, all members of the public are not\nnecessarily in schools so that they are at risk of being assaulted in a classroom or, even if\nthey are in a school, of being affected by a less effective teaching environment.\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f       We agree that, as stated by the dissent, the issue in this case is whether “a teacher\n\n[can] sue a school board for its failure to expel a student who allegedly assaulted that\n\nteacher.” Post at ___. In its many erroneous blanket statements about what we are\n\nholding today, the dissent seems to assume that we have answered that question with a\n\ndefinitive “yes.” To the contrary, however, we have not. We have only held that if a\n\nteacher cannot sue the school board for allegedly failing to comply with MCL\n\n380.1311a(1), standing is not the reason why. In their motion for summary disposition,\n\ndefendants raised several arguments as to why plaintiffs cannot sue the school board\n\nbesides standing, including that plaintiffs have failed to plead a cause of action and that\n\ntheir claims fail as a matter of law.25 Plaintiffs appealed those issues. Because the Court\n\nof Appeals decided the case on the basis of standing alone, and did not reach the other\n\nissues, we remand to that Court to address the remaining issues.26\n\n\n       25\n          As discussed, the merits of a party’s claims and their right to the requested\nremedies were frequently intertwined in the standing analysis erroneously adopted in Lee.\nIndeed, the dissent in this case perfectly models this troubling aspect of that decision.\nBut, under the proper approach to standing, the issues of whether plaintiffs have\nsufficiently pleaded a cause of action and are entitled to the requested remedies are\nindependent of the standing inquiry. Indeed, the issues the dissent raises regarding\nwhether students’ rights would be violated if a court decided to review the school board’s\ndisciplinary hearings and discretionary decision and found that plaintiffs were entitled to\nan injunction expelling the students, are certainly premature at this point.\n       26\n          Just as the dissent’s cries that the historical standing test, in general, will lead to\na stampede to the courthouse ignore that we are reversing a decision that is only nine\nyears old, the dissent’s cries regarding the stampede of lawsuits that will result from this\nspecific case ignore that the Revised School Code predated Lee and yet the courts were\nnot overburdened with similar cases before Lee. The reason for this lack of lawsuits is\nself-evident, as standing is certainly not the only hurdle to prevailing in a case, including\nwinning on the merits. As noted, we are not holding that there is an implied cause of\n\n\n                                               27\n\f       In summary, we hold that plaintiffs have standing because plaintiffs have a\n\nsubstantial interest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1) that is detrimentally\n\naffected in a manner distinct from that of the general public if the statute is not enforced.\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n       We overrule the standing test adopted in Lee and its progeny and restore Michigan\n\nstanding jurisprudence to be consistent with the doctrine’s long-standing, prudential\n\nroots. We reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and remand to that Court to determine\n\nwhether plaintiffs meet the requirements of MCR 2.605. Further, because we hold that\n\nplaintiffs have standing to pursue their remaining claims, we also remand to the Court of\n\nAppeals for consideration of the issues that it did not previously reach.\n\n\n       KELLY, C.J., and WEAVER (except for the part entitled “Stare Decisis”), and\n\nHATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.\n\n\n\n\naction for private damages under the Revised School Code. Thus, the teacher-plaintiffs\nseeking enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1) must meet the requirements for some other\ncause of action, such as a writ of mandamus under MCR 3.305 or a declaratory action\nunder MCR 2.605(A)(1). As the dissent’s analysis indicates, these may be difficult\nhurdles to clear.\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f                           STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                  SUPREME COURT\n\n\nLANSING SCHOOLS EDUCATION\nASSOCIATION, MEA/NEA, CATHY\nSTACHWICK, PENNY FILONCZUK,\nELIZABETH NAMIE, and ELLEN\nWHEELER,\n\n             Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                          No. 138401\n\nLANSING BOARD OF EDUCATION and\nLANSING SCHOOL DISTRICT,\n\n             Defendants-Appellees.\n\n\nWEAVER, J. (concurring).\n\n      I concur in and sign all of the majority opinion except part II (C), entitled “Stare\n\nDecisis.”\n\n      I write separately to expand on footnote 8 of the majority opinion by providing\n\nsome of the additional criticisms of Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm’rs, 464 Mich 726;\n\n629 NW2d 900 (2001), and its progeny mentioned in footnote 8.\n\n      As I stated in my dissenting opinion in Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation\n\nv Nestlé Waters North America Inc, 479 Mich 280, 311; 737 NW2d 447 (2007):\n\n              Beginning with Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm’rs, the majority\n      overruled Michigan precedent establishing prudential standing as the\n      traditional doctrine of legal standing in Michigan. In place of Michigan’s\n      doctrine of prudential standing, the majority erroneously adopted a\n\f       constitutional doctrine of standing based on the federal courts’ doctrine of\n       standing, as stated in Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife.[1]\n\nI further stated that:\n\n              Before Lee, no Michigan case had held that the issue of standing\n       posed a constitutional issue.[2] Nor did any case hold that Michigan’s\n       judicial branch was subject to the same case-or-controversy limitation\n       imposed on the federal judicial branch under article III of the United States\n       Constitution.[3] In fact, article III standing derived from Lujan was not even\n       an issue raised or briefed by the parties in Lee. On its own initiative, the\n       majority of four raised Lujan’s standing test and erroneously transformed\n       standing in Michigan into a constitutional question. [Id. at 312-313.]\n\n       After the majority in Lee created a constitutional standing test for Michigan, the\n\nsame “majority of four” (former Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, and\n\n       1\n           Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, 504 US 555; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351\n(1992).\n       2\n        Before Lee, the Michigan standing requirements were based on prudential, rather\nthan constitutional, concerns. See, generally, House Speaker v State Admin Bd, 441 Mich\n547, 559 n 20; 495 NW2d 539 (1993), and Justice RILEY's concurrence in Detroit Fire\nFighters Ass’n v Detroit, 449 Mich 629, 643; 537 NW2d 436 (1995).\n       3\n           As I wrote in my concurrence in Lee:\n              In House Speaker we stated that “this Court is not bound to follow\n       federal cases regarding standing,” pointing out that “[o]ne notable\n       distinction between federal and state standing analysis is the power of this\n       Court to issue advisory opinions. Const 1963, art 3, § 8. Under Article III of\n       the federal constitution, federal courts may issue opinions only where there\n       is an actual case or controversy.” [House Speaker, 441 Mich at] 559,\n       including n 20.

As I further stated in Nestlé:\n\n              In Nat’l Wildlife [Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, 471 Mich\n       608; 684 NW2d 800 (2004)], the majority of four attacked [the Michigan\n       Environmental Protection Act, MCL 324.1701 et seq. (MEPA)] by stating\n       at length, all in dicta, that the Legislature cannot grant citizens standing.\n       The majority based this argument on the premise that the Legislature would\n       be taking away the power to enforce laws, an essential component of the\n       “executive power,” and giving that power to the judicial branch. The\n       majority proudly proclaimed that it was “resisting an expansion of power—\n       not an everyday occurrence in the annals of modern government.”[4]\n       Unfortunately, that statement was not accurate, because the majority\n       showed its lack of judicial restraint by compromising the Legislature’s\n       constitutional duty to enact laws for the protection of the environment and\n       enlarging the Court’s capacity to overrule statutes under the guise of the\n       majority’s self-initiated, erroneous “constitutional” doctrine of standing.[5]\n       [479 Mich at 315.]\n\n       As Justice CAVANAGH’s majority opinion in this case states at footnote 10, I\n\ndescribed in Nat’l Wildlife how the Lee standing doctrine violated separation of powers\n\nunder the Michigan Constitution. In Nat’l Wildlife, I stated:\n\n              While pretending to limit its “judicial power,” the majority’s\n       application of Lee’s judicial standing test in this case actually expands the\n       power of the judiciary at the expense of the Legislature by undermining the\n       Legislature’s constitutional authority to enact laws . . . . [471 Mich at 654\n       (WEAVER, J., concurring).]\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Nat’l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 639 (emphasis in original).\n       5\n         “[F]aux judicial restraint is judicial obfuscation.” Federal Election Comm v\nWisconsin Right to Life, Inc, 551 US 449, 499 n 7; 127 S Ct 2652; 168 L Ed 2d 329\n(2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fIn expanding the judicial power by making standing a constitutional concern, the\n\n“majority of four” took\n\n       the area of legal standing out of the hands of the Legislature and the people\n       and placed it exclusively at [the majority of four’s] mercy. To make\n       standing a constitutional concern when our Michigan Constitution is\n       completely silent regarding which of the government’s branches has power\n       to grant standing represents judicial activism of the most objectionable\n       sort.” [Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Sch, 479 Mich 336, 373; 737 NW2d 158\n       (2007).]\n\n       Lee and its progeny clearly defied common sense and fairness, as those cases\n\nignored Michigan’s Constitution and imposed “unprecedented, judge-made restrictions\n\non . . . access to the courts.” Nat’l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 654 (WEAVER, J., concurring).\n\nThe Lee standing doctrine represented an unprecedented and unrestrained expansion of\n\njudicial power that dishonored our Michigan Constitution and decimated the rule of law\n\nand therefore it must be reversed. Accordingly, for the reasons I have given over the last\n\nnine (9) years since Lee was decided and for the reasons in Justice CAVANAGH’s majority\n\nopinion in this case, I vote to overrule Lee and its progeny.\n\n       With regard to the policy of stare decisis, my view is that past precedent should\n\ngenerally be followed but that to serve the rule of law, in deciding whether wrongly\n\ndecided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its\n\nfacts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness. I\n\nagree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief Justice Roberts of the United States\n\nSupreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in Citizens United v Fed Election\n\nComm, 558 US ___, ___; 130 S Ct 876, 920; 175 L Ed 2d 753, 806 (2010), when he said\n\nthat\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       stare decisis is neither an “inexorable command,” Lawrence v. Texas, 539\n       U. S. 558, 577 [123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508] (2003), nor “a mechanical\n       formula of adherence to the latest decision,” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.\n       S. 106, 119 [60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604] (1940) . . . . If it were, segregation\n       would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the\n       Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first\n       obtaining warrants. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 [16 S Ct 1138;\n       41 L Ed 256] (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.\n       483 [74 S Ct 686; 98 L Ed 873] (1954); Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D.\n       C., 261 U. S. 525 [43 S. Ct. 394; 67 L Ed 785] (1923), overruled by West\n       Coast Hotel Co v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 [57 S.

S. 347 [88 S Ct\n       507; 19 L Ed 2d 576] (1967).\n\nChief Justice Roberts further called stare decisis a “principle of policy” and said that it “is\n\nnot an end in itself.” Id. at ___; 130 S Ct at 920; 175 L Ed 2d at 807. He explained that\n\n“[i]ts greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law. It follows that in\n\nthe unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage\n\nthis constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that\n\nprecedent.” Id. at ___; 130 S Ct at 921; 175 L Ed 2d at 807.6\n\n\n\n       6\n          It appears that the dissent in this case does not agree with Chief Justice Roberts.\nThe dissent refers to cases that have been overruled by this Court in the past 18 months.\nWhile the dissenting justices may feel aggrieved by this Court overruling those cases,\namongst those cases were some of the most egregious examples of judicial activism that\ndid great harm to the people of Michigan. Those decisions were made by the “majority\nof four,” including the dissenting justices, under the guise of ideologies such as\n“textualism” and “judicial traditionalism.” One of the dissenting justices, Justice YOUNG,\nexpressed his apparent contempt for the common law and common sense in his 2004\narticle in the Texas Review of Law and Politics, where Justice YOUNG stated:\n\n             Consequently, I want to focus my remarks here on the\n       embarrassment that the common law presents—or ought to present—to a\n       conscientious judicial traditionalist. . . .\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       I agree with Chief Justice Roberts that stare decisis is a policy and not an\n\nimmutable doctrine. I chose not to sign Chief Justice KELLY’s lead opinion in Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 316-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to\n\ncreate a standardized test for stare decisis. Likewise, I do not sign the majority opinion’s\n\nstare decisis section in this case because it applies Petersen. There is no need for this\n\nCourt to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis. In fact, it is an impossible\n\ntask. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule\n\nprecedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case basis.7\n\n       In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly\n\ndecided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and\n\nexercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness—justice for all.\n\n\n\n\n              To give a graphic illustration of my feelings on the subject, I tend to\n       think of the common law as a drunken, toothless ancient relative, sprawled\n       prominently and in a state of nature on a settee in the middle of one’s\n       genteel garden party. Grandpa’s presence is undoubtedly a cause of\n       mortification to the host. But since only the most ill-bred of guests would\n       be coarse enough to comment on Grandpa’s presence and condition, all\n       concerned simply try ignore him.

By no means do I consider the Robinson guidelines a “be-all, end-\nall test” that constitutes precedent of this Court to be used whenever this Court considers\noverruling precedent.

(concurring).\n\n       I fully concur with Justice CAVANAGH’s analysis and conclusion in this matter and\n\nI support overruling Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm’rs, 464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900\n\n(2001). Further, I agree with the additional criticisms of Lee articulated in Justice\n\nWEAVER’s thoughtful concurrence. I write separately to express my thoughts on the\n\ndoctrine of stare decisis.\n\n       Given the debate amongst the justices of this Court concerning what constitutes\n\nthe proper stare decisis analysis, I find it insightful to review how our United States\n\nSupreme Court has treated the doctrine.     Stare decisis is a principle of policy that\n\ncommands judicial respect for a court’s earlier decisions and the rules of law that they\n\nembody. See Harris v United States, 536 US 545, 556-557; 122 S Ct 2406; 153 L Ed 2d\n\f524 (2002); Helvering v Hallock, 309 US 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940).\n\n“Stare decisis is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable,\n\nand consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and\n\ncontributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”          Payne v\n\nTennessee, 501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). However, when\n\nbalancing the need to depart from precedent with the need to adhere to established\n\nprecedent, it is important to bear in mind that stare decisis is neither an “inexorable\n\ncommand,” Lawrence v Texas, 539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508\n\n(2003), nor “a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,” Helvering, 309\n\nUS at 119. “If it were, segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be\n\nunconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without\n\nfirst obtaining warrants. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 [16 S Ct 1138; 41 L Ed\n\n256] (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 [74 S Ct 686; 98\n\nL Ed 873] (1954); Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 [43 S Ct 394; 67\n\nL Ed 785] (1923), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parish, 300 U. S. 379 [57 S Ct\n\n578; 81 L Ed 703] (1937); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 [48 S Ct 564; 72 L\n\nEd 944] (1928), overruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 [88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed\n\n2d 576] (1967).” Citizens United v Fed Election Comm, 558 US __, __; 130 S Ct 876,\n\n920; 175 L Ed 2d 753, 806 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring).\n\n       I too believe that stare decisis is a principle of policy. As stated in Helvering:\n\n              We recognize that stare decisis embodies an important social policy.\n       It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the\n       psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations. But stare decisis is a\n\n\n                                              2\n\f      principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest\n      decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves\n      collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically\n      sounder, and verified by experience.[1]\n\n      I do not agree with any approach to stare decisis that suggests or implies that it is a\n\n“rule” or “law” subject to a particularized test to be used in all circumstances. Any\n\nparticular approach to stare decisis, such as the one taken in Robinson v Detroit, 462\n\nMich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), is not “law” or “established precedent” that would\n\nrequire us to overrule, reject or modify its analysis. The Robinson approach to stare\n\ndecisis, just as the one taken in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300; 773 NW2d 564\n\n(2009), is one among many varying approaches, and no particular approach, in and of\n\nitself, is inherently superior to another. As with any policy determination, the approach\n\ntaken in any given case will depend on the facts and circumstances presented.\n\n      Historically, the United States Supreme Court has utilized many different\n\napproaches to stare decisis, including such approaches as those involving a “compelling\n\njustification,”2 “special justification,”3 and a determination that a case was “wrongly\n\ndecided.”4 Each of these approaches is valid and offers a different nuance to stare decisis\n\n\n\n      1\n          Helvering, 309 US at 119.\n      2\n        14 Penn Plaza LLC v Pyett, 556 US ___, ___; 129 S Ct 1456, 1478; 173 L Ed 2d\n398, 425 (2009).\n      3\n          Arizona v Rumsey, 467 US 203, 212; 104 S Ct 2305; 81 L Ed 2d 164 (1984).\n      4\n         Seminole Tribe of Florida v Florida, 517 US 44, 66; 116 S Ct 1114; 134 L Ed\n2d 252 (1996).\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fconsideration.5 However, because stare decisis is a policy consideration, which must be\n\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis, the particular analytical approach will differ from\n\ncase to case. Most importantly, the critical analysis should be on the rationale regarding\n\nwhether or not to change precedent.\n\n       It is also worthy to note that not only has the United States Supreme Court\n\nhistorically not taken one single approach to the application of stare decisis, the Court has\n\nnot felt compelled to discuss stare decisis in all cases when precedent is being overturned.\n\nMany landmark cases that overruled well-established precedent did not discuss or even\n\nmention the phrase “stare decisis.” For example, Brown overruled Plessy, thereby ending\n\nsegregation in our public schools, without mentioning the phrase “stare decisis,” much\n\nless articulating and following a particularized test. Similarly, Gideon v Wainwright, 372\n\nUS 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), which established the rights of indigents to\n\nhave counsel in all criminal cases, not merely capital offenses, overruled Betts v Brady,\n\n316 US 455; 62 S Ct 1252; 86 L Ed 1595 (1942), again without mentioning “stare\n\ndecisis” or a particularized test. Instead, both of these cases focused on the important\n\npolicy considerations that weighed in favor of overruling precedent.6\n\n\n\n       5\n        Any of these approaches to stare decisis can be valid depending on the issues\nbefore the court. However, the factors used in any of these tests may or may not be\napplicable in any given case.\n       6\n         See Supreme Court Decisions Overruled By Subsequent Decisions, available at\n<http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/048.pdf> (accessed July 28, 2010), for\na partial list of United States Supreme Court cases (covering the period from 1810 to\n2001) that overrule precedent. Numerous additional examples can be found on this list of\n\n\n                                             4\n\f        With these principles in mind, any analysis of the impact of stare decisis must\n\nfocus on the individual case and the reason for overruling precedent. Thus, the reasons\n\nfor overruling Lee are paramount to any articulated test and the special and compelling\n\njustifications to do so are overwhelming in this case. As I agree with the well articulated\n\nreasons expressed by Justice CAVANAGH and Justice WEAVER, I will not repeat them\n\nhere.\n\n\n                                                        Diane M.

(dissenting).\n\n      I dissent. In one fell swoop, the majority permits unlimited interference by courts\n\nin the local educational process and rewrites the entire constitutionally based legal\n\ndoctrine governing standing in Michigan. Contrary to the majority’s decision, the lower\n\ncourts correctly concluded that the plaintiff teachers here have no statutory right to\n\ndemand the permanent expulsion of four particular children, and potentially innumerable\n\nother children, from all Michigan schools. Under any meaningful test for standing,\n\nplaintiffs cannot enlist the courts to compel locally elected school districts to expel\n\nstudents under the circumstances presented here.\n\f      The majority reverses the lower courts’ rulings, however, by creating a vague new\n\nstanding “test”—which is really no test at all—that violates the constitutional separation\n\nof powers mandate and gives courts unbounded discretion to overturn the decisions of\n\nother branches of government.         In its haste to overrule this Court’s standing\n\njurisprudence, instead of addressing the issues framed by the parties, the majority asks\n\nand answers a question solely of its own making: whether Lee v Macomb Co Bd of\n\nComm’rs, 464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), was correctly decided.1 In doing so, the\n\nmajority jettisons years of binding precedent on the basis of four justices’ current\n\nestimation that the public would be better served by opening the courts to all manner of\n\nchallenges to acts of the legislative and executive branches. In overruling numerous\n\ncases, the majority throws into question the analyses and results in no fewer than eight\n\nsignificant, precedent-setting disputes including: Manuel v Gill, 481 Mich 637; 753\n\nNW2d 48 (2008); Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Sch, 479 Mich 336; 737 NW2d 158 (2007);\n\nMich Chiropractic Council v Comm’r of the Office of Fin & Ins Servs, 475 Mich 363;\n\n716 NW2d 561 (2006); Associated Builders & Contractors v Dep’t of Consumer & Indus\n\nServs Director, 472 Mich 117; 693 NW2d 374 (2005); Mich Citizens for Water\n\nConservation v Nestlé Waters North America Inc, 479 Mich 280; 737 NW2d 447 (2007);\n\n\n      1\n         The parties addressed this issue only after the majority directed them to do so in\nthis Court’s order granting plaintiffs’ application for leave to appeal. Lansing Sch Ed\nAss’n v Lansing Bd of Ed, 485 Mich 966 (2009). Before this order issued—indeed, from\nthe inception of this case—the parties agreed that Lee was the governing legal authority;\neach side affirmatively argued that Lee controlled and urged that Lee supported its\nposition.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fNat’l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, 471 Mich 608; 684 NW2d 800\n\n(2004); Crawford v Dep’t of Civil Serv, 466 Mich 250; 645 NW2d 6 (2002); and, of\n\ncourse, Lee itself.\n\n       Moreover, in concluding that plaintiffs have standing here, the majority illustrates\n\nthe fundamental problem with its approach: it adopts no meaningful limitations for a\n\nbinding doctrine that applies in every civil lawsuit brought in this state. Here it opens the\n\ncourthouse doors for any school teacher, volunteer, contractor or student to demand that a\n\ncourt expel children from their schools even though a local school board has concluded\n\nthat expulsion was inappropriate. The majority thus authorizes courts not only to invade\n\nthe provinces of school districts and the state board of education, but also to deprive\n\nchildren of their rights to public education without affording them any due process\n\nprotections or legal representation. Indeed, none of the children targeted for expulsion\n\nare even named as parties in this suit. It is unfathomable that a court nonetheless has the\n\npower to permanently expel them from school—yet the majority so holds.\n\n       Critically, in overruling the entire body of Michigan’s existing standing\n\njurisprudence, the majority eschews the clear understanding of the “judicial power” held\n\nby the framers of our state constitution. It also eliminates our workable, principled\n\nstanding test, which mirrors that of the federal courts and of many state courts with\n\nconstitutions similar to our own. Indeed no state in the union incorporates explicit “case\n\nor controversy” language into its constitution, yet many states explicitly employ the\n\nfederal test—which is rooted in the traditional case or controversy requirement—that we\n\nadopted in Lee.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Finally, in effecting these unprecedented changes to Michigan’s standing\n\njurisprudence, the majority ignores the doctrine of stare decisis while paying lip service\n\nto it. The majority inexplicably concludes that Lee was clearly wrongly decided, and that\n\n“Lee and its progeny departed dramatically from historical jurisprudence,” although each\n\nmember of the current majority who served on this Court during the relevant time\n\nperiod—Justice CAVANAGH, Chief Justice KELLY, and Justice WEAVER—adopted Lee as\n\nthe correct test at some point in the past.2\n\n       For each of these reasons, I vigorously dissent. I would affirm the decision of the\n\nCourt of Appeals, which faithfully and appropriately applied the law of this state in\n\nconcluding that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue this action.\n\n                             I. THE QUESTION PRESENTED\n\n       This case, brought by four Lansing teachers and their union, originally presented a\n\nstraightforward question: can a teacher sue a school board for its failure to expel a student\n\nwho allegedly assaulted that teacher? To be clear, this case does not ask whether the\n\npublic has an interest in the welfare of its teachers; our desire for their safety is\n\nindisputable. Nor does the case ask whether § 1311a of the Revised School Code, MCL\n\n380.1 et seq., requires a school board to expel a student who “commits a physical assault\n\nat school against a person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the\n\n\n       2\n         See Associated Builders, 472 Mich at 126-127 (WEAVER, J.); Lee, 464 Mich at\n750 (KELLY, J., dissenting, joined by CAVANAGH, J.); Detroit Fire Fighters Ass'n v\nDetroit, 449 Mich 629, 651-652; 537 NW2d 436 (1995) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting in\npart and concurring in part).\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fschool board,” MCL 380.1311a(1); the parties do not dispute the unambiguous language\n\nof this provision. Further, the defendant school board and school district do not argue\n\nthat they may ignore this mandate despite their conclusion following a student\n\ndisciplinary proceeding that a student committed a physical assault as defined by the\n\ncode. Rather, the parties dispute whether plaintiffs have standing to intervene, by way of\n\na collateral civil suit, when they disagree with defendants’ underlying decision that the\n\nacts of the students at issue did not constitute physical assaults for purposes of applying\n\nthe mandatory expulsion provision of MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n       Accordingly, this case specifically asks whether the courts may decide, at the\n\nbehest of a particular teacher, that a school board must permanently expel a particular\n\nstudent without any notice to the student or his parents. The plaintiff teachers argued that\n\nthey should be empowered to seek a court order directing permanent expulsion of\n\nstudents under MCL 380.1311a(1). The majority agrees and holds, under its broad new\n\nstandard, that plaintiffs have standing to proceed.\n\n       This holding is contrary both to settled principles of law regarding when a party\n\nhas statutory and constitutional standing to bring a claim, as well as to the result\n\ndemanded by the particular facts and circumstances of this case. The School Code itself\n\nclearly establishes that the mandate in MCL 380.1311a(1) is to be enforced by the state\n\nexecutive branch and the locally elected school boards. Moreover, it is for the school\n\ndistricts—not the courts or individual teachers—to decide whether a particular student\n\ncommitted an assault requiring expulsion. Plaintiffs offer no justification for the judicial\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fbranch to usurp these powers, which are specifically delegated to other branches of\n\ngovernment.\n\n       Finally, plaintiffs have never described how the courts could successfully\n\nintervene. Their analysis fails to account for the fact that a board’s decision to expel a\n\nstudent occurs only after a disciplinary proceeding where the student’s constitutional\n\nrights are protected and where the board must make a careful, discretionary, factual\n\ndecision concerning whether the student had the requisite intent to commit a “physical\n\nassault” as defined by the school code. According to the Michigan Association of School\n\nBoards, more than 100,000 such disciplinary proceedings occur in Michigan each school\n\nyear. Yet plaintiffs seek to intervene after the fact in a case where the students are not\n\nrepresented, asking the Court to revisit and overrule innumerable decisions of the elected\n\nschool boards. Moreover, plaintiffs never explain why other enforcement mechanisms—\n\nincluding not only the explicit statutory enforcement provisions, but also negotiations\n\nwith the school board under their collective bargaining agreement—are inadequate to\n\nensure appropriate enforcement of the applicable statute.\n\n       Thus, like the lower courts, I cannot conclude that teachers have standing to obtain\n\ncourt orders compelling expulsion of students in contravention of a school board’s\n\ndecision that the students’ acts did not require expulsion. Perhaps most significantly, by\n\nchoosing to overrule this Court’s constitutional standing doctrine sua sponte, the majority\n\ngives the courts carte blanche to invade the school board’s decision-making province,\n\ndepriving those boards of their constitutionally delegated responsibilities and depriving\n\nstudents of their rights to public education without affording them due process. This case\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthus illustrates the absolutely untenable nature of the majority’s new approach—an\n\napproach that, unfortunately, is characteristic of the majority’s assault on the rule of law.\n\n      A. LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE REVISED SCHOOL CODE\n\n            1. GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS\n\n       The Revised School Code, originally enacted in 1976,3 describes the “rights,\n\npowers, and duties” of school districts.      MCL 380.11a(3).       The powers and duties\n\noriginate from the Michigan Constitution, which established that the “legislature shall\n\nmaintain and support a system of free public elementary and secondary schools . . . .”\n\nConst 1963, art 8, § 2. Consistent with this mandate, the Legislature enacted the school\n\ncode and provided that school districts would be governed by locally elected school\n\nboards. MCL 380.11a(5), (7). The constitution also vested “[l]eadership and general\n\nsupervision over all public education” in the elected members of the state board of\n\neducation. Const 1963, art 8, § 3.\n\n       Significantly, both the constitution and the school code make plain that school\n\ndistricts’ central purposes are the education and protection of students. Const 1963, art 8,\n\n§ 2, requires a system of free public schools and states simply: “Every school district\n\nshall provide for the education of its pupils without discrimination as to religion, creed,\n\nrace, color or national origin.” The school code, in turn, defines district functions to\n\ninclude “[e]ducating pupils,” MCL 380.11a(3)(a), and “[p]roviding for the safety and\n\nwelfare of pupils while at school or a school sponsored activity or while en route to or\n\n       3\n           1976 PA 451.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\ffrom school or a school sponsored activity,” MCL 380.11a(3)(b). A district’s functions\n\nwith regard to employees, however, center on “[h]iring, contracting for, scheduling,\n\nsupervising, or terminating employees, independent contractors, and others to carry out\n\nschool district powers.” MCL 380.11a(3)(d).\n\n          2. DISCIPLINARY POWERS AND DUTIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS\n\n      School districts’ powers and duties with regard to students include disciplinary\n\nmeasures subject to varying degrees of discretion by the board and its employees. For\n\nexample, a district has discretion to suspend or expel a student who is “guilty of gross\n\nmisdemeanor or persistent disobedience if, in the judgment of the school board or its\n\ndesignee, as applicable, the interest of the school is served” by suspension or expulsion.\n\nMCL 380.1311(1). A school board must permanently expel4 a student under certain\n\ncircumstances, including possession of a weapon (subject to some exceptions), arson, or\n\ncriminal sexual conduct on school grounds.       MCL 380.1311(2).      Even under these\n\ncircumstances, however, the student or his parent may petition for reinstatement to public\n\neducation when a period of up to 180 days has elapsed after his expulsion. MCL\n\n380.1311(5).\n\n      The statutory provision at issue in this case, MCL 380.1311a(1), was added to the\n\nschool code by the Legislature in 1999 as one of several bills—including the safe schools\n\n\n      4\n         Permanent expulsion generally means that a student may not attend any public\nschool in Michigan. But expelled students may be eligible to attend alternative education\nprograms and strict discipline academies or to receive in-home instructional services.\nMCL 380.1311(3).\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fand communities law, 1999 PA 23—addressing school safety and student discipline.5\n\nThe 1999 bills mandated a statewide school safety information policy to be\n\ncollaboratively adopted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Attorney\n\nGeneral, and the director of the Department of State Police. MCL 380.1308(1). The bills\n\nalso enacted guidelines for student discipline under various circumstances and established\n\nstrict discipline academies, MCL 380.1311b, for particular students, including those\n\nexpelled from their regular public schools, MCL 380.1311g(3)(b), (c).\n\n      MCL 380.1311a(1) requires permanent expulsion “[i]f a pupil enrolled in grade 6\n\nor above commits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged\n\nas a volunteer or contractor by the school board” and the assault is properly reported to\n\nschool officials. For purposes of this section, “physical assault” means “intentionally\n\ncausing or attempting to cause physical harm to another through force or violence.”\n\nMCL 380.1311a(12)(b).\n\n                                  3. ENFORCEMENT\n\n      The school code’s provisions are enforced by several mechanisms. First, school\n\nboard members, school officials, and any “other person who neglects or refuses to do or\n\nperform an act” required by the code, or “who violates or knowingly permits or consents\n\nto a violation” of the code, is subject to misdemeanor prosecution. MCL 380.1804.\n\nSecond, under MCL 380.1806, a school board “may dismiss from employment and\n\ncancel the contract of a superintendent, principal, or teacher who neglects or refuses to\n\n      5\n          1999 PA 102 to 104; 1999 PA 23.\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fcomply” with the code. Third, because the members of school boards and the state board\n\nof education are elected officials, their acts and policies are regularly reviewed—and\n\naccepted or rejected—by the electorate.\n\n      It is also significant that the Legislature has enacted a comprehensive, carefully\n\nmonitored scheme to address safety within our schools. For example, the statewide\n\nschool safety information policy requires school officials to report various school\n\nincidents to law enforcement agencies for investigation.      MCL 380.1308(2)(a), (3).\n\nIncidents that require reporting under this section are defined by members of the\n\nexecutive branch, MCL 380.1308(1), “taking into account the intent of the actor and the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the incident,” MCL 380.1308(2)(b).          School boards are\n\nrequired to submit reports that state the number of students expelled during each year and\n\nthe reasons for expulsion, MCL 380.1310a(1), and list crimes including those “involving\n\nphysical violence,” committed at schools, MCL 380.1310a(2).           These reports are\n\nultimately intended, in part, to help policymakers, school districts, communities, and law\n\nenforcement officials “identify the most pressing safety issues confronting their school\n\ncommunities,” “enhance campus safety through prevention and intervention strategies,”\n\n“prevent further crime and violence and . . . assure a safe learning environment for every\n\npupil.” MCL 380.1310a(2)(c), (d). Finally, it is noteworthy that many school districts\n\nare now empowered to create law enforcement agencies within their school systems.\n\nMCL 380.1240.\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f                   B. TEACHERS’ STANDING TO SUE UNDER\n                 SECTION 1311a OF THE REVISED SCHOOL CODE\n\n           1. STANDING AND GROUNDS FOR COURT INTERVENTION\n\n       Despite the Legislature’s comprehensive system, through which executive branch\n\nofficials and local districts set evolving policies and monitor responses to school safety,\n\nthe plaintiff teachers here ask the courts to intervene and dictate the Lansing School\n\nDistrict’s responses to four past incidents—and potentially innumerable future\n\nincidents—involving student misbehavior. Each of the named plaintiffs alleges that she\n\nwas physically assaulted by a middle school student6 and, therefore, that the court should\n\norder permanent expulsion of each student under MCL 380.1311a(1). Plaintiffs further\n\nasked the court to: permanently enjoin defendants from violating MCL 380.1311a in the\n\nfuture; find school officials and board members guilty of misdemeanors for violating the\n\nschool code under MCL 380.1804; and cancel the contracts of the superintendent and any\n\nprincipal for failing to comply with the school code under MCL 380.1806.\n\n       Plaintiffs sought this relief by requesting a declaratory judgment under MCR\n\n2.605, which permits a court to “declare the rights and other legal relations of an\n\n       6\n          Plaintiffs allege that one student threw a leather wristband with metal spikes,\nwhich hit a bulletin board “about two inches” from the plaintiff teacher’s head, bounced,\nand hit the teacher in the face. Plaintiffs further allege that two students separately hit\nplaintiff teachers with chairs. Each teacher suffered bruises as a result. A fourth student\nallegedly slapped a plaintiff teacher on the back with enough force to cause stinging and\nto leave a pink mark. Plaintiffs state that each of these incidents was properly reported to\nschool officials and each student was suspended but not expelled. The parties agree that\nthe defendant school board apparently concluded that none of the four students named in\nthe complaint committed “physical assaults” as defined by the code and, therefore,\nexpulsion was not mandated by MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\finterested party seeking a declaratory judgment . . . .” MCR 2.605(A)(1). They also\n\nsought a writ of mandamus under MCR 3.305, which requires a plaintiff to prove “it has\n\na clear legal right to performance of the specific duty sought to be compelled and the\n\ndefendant has a clear legal duty to perform such act.” Baraga Co v State Tax Comm, 466\n\nMich 264, 268; 645 NW2d 13 (2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nDefendants moved for summary dismissal of plaintiffs’ complaint, arguing that plaintiffs\n\ndid not have standing to seek either remedy.\n\n       Traditional standing principles apply to plaintiffs seeking declaratory relief,\n\nAssociated Builders, 472 Mich at 125, or writs of mandamus, e.g. Detroit Fire Fighters\n\nAss'n v Detroit, 449 Mich 629, 633; 537 NW2d 436 (1995). As this Court explained in\n\nAssociated Builders, addressing declaratory actions:\n\n              “[I]f a court would not otherwise have subject matter jurisdiction\n       over the issue before it or, if the issue is not justiciable because it does not\n       involve a genuine, live controversy between interested persons asserting\n       adverse claims, the decision of which can definitively affect existing legal\n       relations, a court may not declare the rights and obligations of the parties\n       before it.” [Associated Builders, 472 Mich at 125, quoting Allstate Ins Co v\n       Hayes, 442 Mich 56, 66; 499 NW2d 743 (1993).]\n\nAccordingly, Associated Builders explicitly held, in an opinion authored by Justice\n\nWEAVER, that the test enunciated in Lee, 464 Mich 726, governs standing in declaratory\n\nactions and, as here, in actions where a plaintiff seeks to enforce an alleged statutory right\n\nbut the statute does not confer standing by its own terms. Associated Builders, 472 Mich\n\nat 127 n 16. Therefore, until today, plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing each of the\n\nfollowing elements of standing in order to invoke court jurisdiction:\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f              First, the plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact”—an\n      invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and\n      particularized, and (b) “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or\n      ‘hypothetical.’” Second, there must be a causal connection between the\n      injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be “fairly . . .\n      trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result\n      [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.”\n      Third, it must be “likely,” as opposed to merely “speculative,” that the\n      injury will be “redressed by a favorable decision.” [Lujan v Defenders of\n      Wildlife, 504 US 555, 560-561; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992)\n      (citations omitted); quoted and adopted by Lee, 464 Mich at 739; quoted\n      and applied to declaratory actions in Associated Builders, 472 Mich at 126-\n      127.]\n\n      Here plaintiffs have not established a legally protected interest in, or clear legal\n\nright to, expulsion of students under MCL 380.1311a(1). Plaintiffs also have not shown\n\nthat defendants had a clear legal duty to expel the students under the facts presented or\n\nthat plaintiffs’ interests can be addressed by a favorable court decision. Therefore, they\n\ncannot establish standing to seek relief against the school board under MCL\n\n380.1311a(1).\n\n        2. THE ALLEGED RIGHT TO RELIEF ASSERTED BY PLAINTIFFS\n\n      Plaintiffs argue that the text of MCL 380.1311a(1) creates an enforceable right in\n\nteachers and a corresponding duty owed by school districts to teachers. To determine\n\nwhether a plaintiff has standing created by a statute, the court begins by considering “the\n\nstatutory language to determine legislative intent.” Miller v Allstate Ins Co, 481 Mich\n\n601, 610; 751 NW2d 463 (2008). As an initial matter, many of the cases cited by\n\nplaintiffs on this point are inapposite because they address whether a statute creates or\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fimplies a right of action for damages against a private party.7 The inquiry is different\n\nwhen, as here, a governmental agency is involved. Because governmental agencies are\n\ngenerally immune from suit under the governmental tort liability act, MCL 691.1407,8 a\n\nplaintiff may sue a governmental agency for damages only when the Legislature\n\nexpressly so authorizes. Lash v Traverse City, 479 Mich 180, 194; 735 NW2d 628\n\n(2007); Mack v Detroit, 467 Mich 186, 195-196; 649 NW2d 47 (2002). These cases do\n\nnot establish that a plaintiff may infer a private cause of action for damages against a\n\ngovernmental agency.     Rather, in a suit against a governmental agency, a plaintiff\n\ngenerally may seek only injunctive or declaratory relief upon showing that the particular\n\nplaintiff has a clear, legally enforceable right that the particular defendant had a duty to\n\nprotect. Lash, 479 Mich at 196.\n\n       Some of the relief requested by plaintiffs is clearly unavailable because they\n\nimproperly ask the court to require the executive branch and the school district to make\n\n\n       7\n         E.g. Gardner v Wood, 429 Mich 290, 312-314; 414 NW2d 706 (1987) (finding\nno implied cause of action against a private party for violating a provision of the former\nLiquor Control Act, MCL 436.26c); Pompey v Gen Motors Corp, 385 Mich 537, 552-\n553, 560; 189 NW2d 243 (1971) (permitting suit against a private employer for violation\nof the plaintiff’s statutorily created civil rights); Lane v KinderCare Learning Ctrs, Inc,\n231 Mich App 689, 695-696; 588 NW2d 715 (1998) (finding no implied cause of action\nagainst a private party for violating the child care organizations act, MCL 722.111 et\nseq.).\n       8\n         A school district, its board members, and its employees generally qualify for\ngovernmental immunity. See MCL 691.1407(1), (2) (establishing that a “governmental\nagency” and its board members and employees are generally immune from tort liability);\nMCL 691.1401(b), (d) (defining “governmental agency” to include a “political\nsubdivision” of the state and defining “political subdivision” to include school districts).\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fdiscretionary decisions in a particular manner. Although a plaintiff may seek to compel\n\nthe exercise of discretion through a writ of mandamus, he may not compel the exercise of\n\ndiscretion “in a particular manner.” State Bd of Ed v Houghton Lake Community Sch,\n\n430 Mich 658, 666; 425 NW2d 80 (1988) (emphasis added). Courts are not empowered\n\nto require the school board to cancel an employee’s contract for failing to comply with\n\nthe school code. Rather, MCL 380.1806 clearly establishes that a decision to terminate\n\nan employee under these circumstances lies within the board’s discretion because the\n\nstatute states that the board “may” dismiss an employee for violating the code. A\n\nstatute’s use of the word “may” in this context conveys discretion to act, it does not\n\nrequire the act. See Warda v Flushing City Council, 472 Mich 326, 332; 696 NW2d 671\n\n(2005).    Similarly, a court has no power to find individual officials guilty of\n\nmisdemeanors under MCL 380.1804 in this civil case. “The power to determine whether\n\nto charge a defendant [with a criminal offense] and what charge should be brought is an\n\nexecutive power, which vests exclusively in the prosecutor.” People v Gillis, 474 Mich\n\n105, 141 n 19; 712 NW2d 419 (2006); Const 1963, art 3, § 2.9 Indeed, not only is this a\n\ncivil case, but plaintiffs failed to name any individual defendants, so no potentially liable\n\nindividuals are even parties against whom relief may be sought.\n\n\n       9\n         And see People v Chavis, 468 Mich 84, 94 n 6; 658 NW2d 469 (2003): “It is\ninvariably the case that the prosecutor always has great discretion in deciding whether to\nfile charges. Such executive branch power is an established part of our constitutional\nstructure.” The prosecutor’s powers in this regard are tempered by “systemic protections\nafforded defendants” incident to criminal trials and by “elections, which call all office\nholders to account to their constituents.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       Accordingly, the only obtainable relief sought by plaintiffs depends on their\n\nargument that they have a clear, legally protected right to the expulsion of the four\n\nstudents described in the complaint and, potentially, to innumerable future students.\n\nThey stress that MCL 380.1311a(1) addresses assaults on a specific, circumscribed group\n\nof people—any “person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the\n\nschool board”—that includes teachers like themselves. But nothing in the code suggests\n\nthat the statute therefore creates an enforceable right in, or a duty to, this group of people.\n\nAs explained above, the text of the 1999 statutory amendments is aimed at creating a\n\ncomprehensive, statewide program of student discipline governed by the state board of\n\neducation and the local districts. There is no indication of a legislative intent to create\n\nnew rights in teachers beyond their explicit statutory and contract rights.10\n\n       Plaintiffs cite two cases in which courts entertained suits brought by teachers who\n\nsought interpretation of school code provisions: Detroit Federation of Teachers v Detroit\n\nBd of Ed, 396 Mich 220; 240 NW2d 225 (1976) (addressing the former code that\n\npredated the 1976 revised code), and Roek v Chippewa Valley Sch Dist, 122 Mich App\n\n76; 329 NW2d 539 (1982). In Detroit Federation of Teachers, this Court agreed with the\n\ncircuit court’s declaratory decision stating that the defendant board “shall enter into a\n\nwritten, individual contract with each ‘duly qualified’ teacher in its employ” because\n\n\n       10\n           The only authority plaintiffs cited to support their oft-stated conclusion that\nMCL 380.1311a(1) was specifically intended to protect employee safety is HB 5802,\nwhich became 2000 PA 230. But 2000 PA 230 did not enact MCL 380.1311a, as\nplaintiffs incorrectly assumed.\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fwritten contracts with teachers were required by former MCL 340.569, but we concluded\n\nthat the lower courts erred by directing the kind of contract individual teachers would\n\nreceive. 396 Mich at 222, 226. In Roek, the Court resolved the parties’ dispute over\n\nlanguage in MCL 380.1236(2), concluding on the basis of undisputed facts that the\n\nplaintiff qualified, as a matter of law, as a teacher employed as a substitute teacher for\n\n120 days or more during a school year and thus had the basic right to be given first\n\nopportunity to accept or reject a contract under certain circumstances. 122 Mich App at\n\n78-79. Neither of these cases supports plaintiffs’ claim for standing here.\n\n       These cases were concerned with teachers seeking judicial action with regard to\n\nteacher contracts. Thus, the cases addressed issues germane to teachers as direct parties\n\nto statutorily specified employment relationships. Moreover, because the cases involved\n\nthe defendants’ duties to teachers in the employment context, the subject matter fell\n\ndirectly within the scope of specified district functions with regard to employees, which\n\ninclude “contracting.” MCL 380.11a(3)(d). More importantly, Detroit Federation of\n\nTeachers, in particular, is most significant for what it did not do. Although Detroit\n\nFederation of Teachers confirmed the mandatory requirement for written contracts under\n\nthe school code, it reversed the circuit court’s writ of mandamus “directing the kind of\n\ncontract particular teachers would receive.” 396 Mich at 224. It concluded that the\n\n“right protected by the code is the right to a written contract evidencing the employment\n\nrelationship, not to a particular kind of contract.” Id. at 227. Accordingly, the court had\n\nno power to govern the details of the parties’ contractual powers and duties, which the\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fstatute left to be determined through their collective bargaining process or the grievance\n\nprocedure provided by their collective bargaining agreement. Id.\n\n       The case before us does not arise from the parties’ request for the court to\n\ninterpret, as a matter of law, mandatory statutory language addressing teacher contracts.\n\nRather the parties agree that the statutory language is unambiguous and needs no further\n\ninterpretation. Instead, plaintiffs asked the court to revisit a school board’s discretionary\n\nfactual decision as it relates to a disciplinary scheme governing defendants’ responses to\n\nstudent behavior in student disciplinary proceedings.          Thus, instead of supporting\n\nplaintiffs’ argument, the holdings of Detroit Federation of Teachers and Roek depend on\n\ncontrasting facts and illustrate that this case does not involve a statute creating a clear\n\nright in plaintiffs or a clear duty on defendants’ part as their employer.\n\n       Crucially, plaintiffs’ reasoning is by no means limited to teachers. Upon accepting\n\nplaintiffs’ claim that they have an enforceable right under MCL 380.1311a(1), the\n\nmajority establishes that every person mentioned in the student disciplinary statutes now\n\nhas standing to challenge a decision of a school board declining to expel a student who is\n\naccused of assault. As previously discussed, MCL 380.1311a(1) addresses disciplinary\n\nmeasures with regard to students who assault school employees, volunteers, and\n\ncontractors. MCL 380.1310(1), in turn, addresses disciplinary measures when a “pupil\n\nenrolled in grade 6 or above commits a physical assault at school against another pupil.”\n\nThe two provisions are similarly worded and, therefore, the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nteachers have standing to sue here applies with equal force not only to other school\n\nemployees, volunteers and contractors, but to every student who alleges he was\n\n\n                                             18\n\fphysically assaulted by another student. Yet nothing in the school code indicates that the\n\nLegislature intended to create a new right in all school volunteers, contractors,\n\nemployees, or students to compel the expulsion of students, thus opening the floodgates\n\nfor—and overwhelming the courts with—collateral litigation whenever one such person\n\nis dissatisfied with a board’s resolution of a student disciplinary proceeding. For these\n\nreasons, plaintiffs simply have not met their burden to show that the Legislature intended\n\nto create a legally protected right in teachers when it enacted MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n                              3. PLAINTIFFS’ REMEDIES\n\n       Plaintiffs’ claims fail primarily for the above reason: the Revised School Code\n\ndoes not clearly create legal rights in teachers to compel expulsion of students under\n\nMCL 380.1311a(1). But plaintiffs have also failed to show that the Legislature intended\n\nto authorize private suits to enforce MCL 380.1311a(1) or that the other statutory\n\nenforcement mechanisms are not exclusive under these circumstances.            These latter\n\nfailures independently defeat plaintiffs’ claim that judicial relief is available to them in\n\nthis case.\n\n       With regard to plaintiffs’ mandamus complaint, relief is available only if “the law\n\nhas established no specific remedy” for a duty created by law. Houghton Sch, 430 Mich\n\nat 667. The cases cited by plaintiffs similarly hold that, when a right or duty is imposed\n\nby statute, “the remedy provided for enforcement of that right by the statute for its\n\nviolation and nonperformance is exclusive.” Pompey, 385 Mich at 552. As already\n\ndiscussed, the Legislature clearly vested enforcement of the code and its provisions in the\n\nexecutive branch, through misdemeanor prosecutions under MCL 380.1804, and local\n\n\n                                            19\n\fschool districts, which have discretionary power to terminate employees and officials\n\nwho violate the terms of the code, MCL 380.1806. With regard to school safety, the code\n\nprovides an additional layer of local and executive branch monitoring and enforcement\n\nthrough the statewide school safety information policy, MCL 380.1308, and reporting\n\nrequirements, MCL 380.1310a.        Thus, the code’s express terms provide particular\n\nremedies applicable to MCL 380.1311a. This should end the inquiry; these remedies\n\ngenerally should be deemed exclusive.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue, nonetheless, that they may still seek declaratory or mandamus\n\nrelief if the statutory remedies are inadequate.     This Court has never accepted the\n\nargument that courts may create new remedies for the violation of statutory duties on the\n\nbasis of a party’s claim that existing statutory remedies are inadequate. In Lash, this\n\nCourt rejected the argument—which is rooted in dictum from Pompey, 385 Mich at 552 n\n\n14—that an additional remedy might be permitted to supplement a statutory remedy if the\n\nstatutory remedy is “plainly inadequate”; we noted that this dubious principle “has never\n\nsince been cited in any majority opinion of this Court” and “appears inconsistent with\n\nsubsequent caselaw.” Lash, 479 Mich at 192 n 19. Plaintiffs nonetheless suggest that the\n\nprinciple was followed in a Court of Appeals case, Lane, 230 Mich App 696, which cited\n\nPompey and Long v Chelsea Community Hosp, 219 Mich 578, 583; 557 NW2d 157\n\n(1996), for the proposition that “a cause of action can be inferred from the fact that the\n\nstatute provides no adequate means of enforcement of its provisions.” Yet Lane itself\n\nconcluded that the plaintiff could not bring suit in part because the act at issue—the child\n\ncare organizations act, MCL 722.111 et seq.—“adequately provides for enforcement of\n\n\n                                            20\n\fits provisions” through provisions similar to those present in the school code, including\n\ncriminal penalties and proceedings instituted by the Attorney General. Lane, 231 Mich at\n\n696. Notably, the comparable statutory remedies available in this case are ignored by the\n\nmajority opinion.\n\n       In any event, plaintiffs certainly have not shown that the available enforcement\n\nmechanisms are inadequate. In addition to the statutory mechanisms discussed above—\n\nand in addition to the fact that school board members, as elected officials, must answer to\n\nthe public for their acts and policies—plaintiffs never address why their contractual\n\nbargaining process is inadequate to address their safety concerns. Indeed, plaintiffs\n\nconcede that their bargaining agreement with defendants includes provisions to protect\n\nthe workplace safety of its members.11 Thus, consistent with the code’s acknowledgment\n\nof the contract-based relationship between a teacher and a school district, it appears clear\n\nthat plaintiffs not only have an enforcement mechanism at hand but—as in Detroit\n\nFederation of Teachers with regard to the non-justiciable contract terms—may make use\n\nof their bargaining process or grievance procedure to address alleged violations of their\n\nalleged rights to workplace safety. Defendants also reasonably argue that plaintiffs are\n\nclearly empowered to protect themselves by reporting alleged student assaults to their\n\nlocal prosecutor for criminal investigation.\n\n\n\n       11\n          Plaintiffs expressly affirm in their brief that the plaintiff union “has bargained\nlanguage in its master agreement with Defendants-Appellees to protect the workplace\nsafety of its members.”\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\f      Finally, in light of the broad powers the school code establishes in executive\n\nbranch officials and local school boards, permitting individual plaintiffs to enforce MCL\n\n380.1311a could violate both the terms of the code and the Michigan Constitution.\n\nAlthough this Court continues to debate the constitutional ramifications of our standing\n\ndoctrine, we do not disagree about the constitutionally mandated separation of powers\n\namong our three branches of government: “No person exercising powers of one branch\n\nshall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided\n\nin th[e] constitution.” Const 1963, art 3, § 2. Thus, it is clear that the courts cannot\n\nexercise powers expressly allocated to other branches of government.            Here, the\n\nconstitution expressly granted the power to create and supervise public schools to the\n\nstate board of education, Const 1963, art 8, § 3, and the Legislature, Const 1963, art 8,\n\n§ 2, which has delegated governance of the schools in part to the local school boards,\n\nMCL 380.11a(5), (7). Accordingly, the constitution itself supports the conclusion that\n\ncourts may not compel acts of the local school boards without express, constitutionally\n\nsound authorization to do so. The trial court made this very point in its decision granting\n\nsummary disposition:\n\n              Basically, the premise here is that this Court in some fashion or\n      another has the right to look behind the exercise of discretion by the\n      Lansing School District. I don’t think we have any more right to do that\n      than we have to [sic] the Lansing City Council. The Lansing City Counsel\n      [sic] is another branch of government. It’s not our prerogative. That’s\n      not—that’s not something for the Court to do.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f                     4. REDRESSABILITY AND THE EFFECTS ON\n                        STUDENTS’ CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n\n       On a related significant point, plaintiffs offer no workable means by which a court\n\ncould enforce their alleged rights to expulsion of students under MCL 380.1311a(1) even\n\nif the court had some power to intervene through declaratory relief or a mandamus order.\n\nPlaintiffs’ failure in this regard informs and strengthens the conclusion that the statute\n\ndoes not create legally enforceable rights in, or duties to, plaintiffs at all.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ complaint depends entirely on their allegation that the four named\n\nstudents committed “physical assaults” as defined by the code. Plaintiffs tacitly proceed\n\nas if this allegation was undisputed or could be decided by the court. To the contrary, the\n\nparties agree that the factual determination whether a student committed a physical\n\nassault for purposes of the school code is a discretionary one for the school board.\n\nAlthough no authority suggests that a teacher has standing to appeal a school board’s\n\ndisciplinary decision with regard to a particular student, the Court of Appeals has\n\nconcluded that when a student appeals such a decision, “in reviewing the disciplinary\n\norders of a school administration, the courts of this state are bound by that\n\nadministration’s factual findings so long as they are supported by competent, material\n\nand substantial evidence.” Birdsey v Grand Blanc Community Sch, 130 Mich App 718,\n\n723-724; 344 NW2d 342 (1983). Thus the courts have imported the highly deferential\n\nstandard applicable to administrative agencies under Const 1963, art 6, § 28. Id. at 723.\n\nBirdsey also relied on Wood v Strickland, 420 US 308, 325; 95 S Ct 992; 43 L Ed 2d 214\n\n(1975), which concluded that a court is bound to accept a school administration’s finding\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fof fact if there is any evidence in the record to support it. Despite this deferential\n\nstandard for direct appeals of administrative decisions, both the plaintiffs and the\n\nmajority would accord no deference in a collateral appeal to the school board’s apparent\n\ndetermination that the four named students did not commit physical assaults as defined\n\nby MCL 380.1311a(12)(b).\n\n       Although we accept as true the facts alleged by a plaintiff in a complaint for\n\npurposes of a defendant’s motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8),\n\nKuznar v Raksha Corp, 481 Mich 169, 176; 750 NW2d 121 (2008), plaintiffs’\n\ncharacterization of each event as a “physical assault” as defined by MCL\n\n380.1311a(12)(b) is a conclusion drawn from the statutory terms—not a fact.12\n\nAccordingly, a court cannot simply accept this allegation as true or presume that, if the\n\ncase proceeds, it can be resolved in plaintiffs’ favor by a finder of fact at trial. Rather,\n\nthe allegation has apparently already been resolved to the contrary by the entity that\n\nplaintiffs concede is the proper forum—the school board. Under these circumstances,\n\n\n       12\n          Compare Davis v Detroit, 269 Mich App 376, 379 n 1; 711 NW2d 462 (2006)\n(“Plaintiff’s reliance on her allegation in her complaint that the city was engaged in a\nproprietary activity is unwarranted because only factual allegations, not legal\nconclusions, are to be taken as true under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and (8).”). Moreover,\nalthough plaintiffs have not properly placed in issue the school board’s determinations, I\nnote that the students’ alleged acts, see ante, ___ do not unquestionably constitute\nphysical assaults under MCL 380.1311a(12)(b), as plaintiffs simply presume.\nParticularly because the statutory definition of “physical assault” includes a specific\nintent element—“intentionally causing or attempting to cause physical harm,” MCL\n380.1311a(12)(b)—the finder of fact at a disciplinary proceeding could conclude, on the\nbasis of the mental state of the student or the circumstances surrounding each assault, that\nthe student did not affirmatively intend to cause physical harm to his or her teacher.\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fplaintiffs could achieve relief only if they can show, first, that the school board abused its\n\ndiscretion when it determined that the four students’ acts did not constitute physical\n\nassaults and, second, that the court has the power to conclude that the board erred and\n\nthen to overturn the board’s determination in a suit brought by teachers. But plaintiffs\n\nnever explain whether or how the court could review or overturn the board’s\n\ndeterminations in student disciplinary proceedings that have long-since concluded, let\n\nalone by way of this collateral suit in which the students at issue are not even represented.\n\n       Indeed, all other issues aside, plaintiffs’ claims with regard to the four named\n\nstudents appear moot in any event because the disciplinary proceedings concluded years\n\nago. The alleged assaults occurred in January 2007, September 2006, May 2006, and\n\nOctober 2005. Even if some of the students are still enrolled in the district, plaintiffs\n\nprovide no authority suggesting that they could be expelled now; had they been expelled\n\nat the time of the incidents, by now each of them could have petitioned for reinstatement\n\nto public school under MCL 380.1311a(5) (a court may grant a petition for reinstatement\n\nbeginning 180 days after the date of expulsion, MCL 380.1311a[5][(b]).13\n\n       With regard to future students, plaintiffs do not explain how a declaratory\n\njudgment requiring defendants to comply with MCL 380.1311a(1) would have any effect\n\nwhatsoever. Whether a student committed a physical assault is determined on a case-by-\n\n\n       13\n         Further, because it was the students’ behavior that injured plaintiffs, plaintiffs’\nprayer for relief with regard to the four named students appears untenable for the simple\nreason that the alleged injuries were not caused by defendants’ failure to expel the\nstudents after the assaults.\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fcase basis depending on the particular facts and in accordance with the student’s\n\nconstitutional rights. Therefore, the most a court could do would be to redundantly repeat\n\nthe undisputed terms of the statute itself: “If a pupil enrolled in grade 6 or above\n\ncommits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged as a\n\nvolunteer or contractor by the school board . . . , then the school board . . . shall expel the\n\npupil from the school district permanently, subject to possible reinstatement . . . .” MCL\n\n380.1311a(1) (emphasis added).        Plaintiffs’ claimed relief thus supports defendants’\n\nsuggestion that what plaintiffs really desire is for the court—or the plaintiffs\n\nthemselves—to determine whether a “physical assault” occurred for purposes of applying\n\nMCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n       Finally, as noted, permitting plaintiffs’ complaint to proceed here permits any\n\nperson who alleges he is the victim of student misbehavior to independently sue the board\n\nwhen the board concludes that the student’s acts did not qualify for mandatory\n\nsuspension or expulsion. That is, under the majority’s analysis, any employee, volunteer,\n\nor contractor of the school may now collaterally sue on the basis of assault allegations\n\nunder MCL 380.1311a(1). And any student may sue, seeking suspension or expulsion of\n\na fellow student, on the basis of assault allegations under MCL 380.1310(1). And these\n\nsuits may be filed although the student disciplinary proceeding is over and although the\n\naccused student’s rights are not represented because he is not a party to the lawsuit.\n\n       Crucially, neither the majority nor plaintiffs ever address the rights of the accused\n\nstudents. Students have a property interest in their entitlement to public education that\n\ncannot be “taken away for misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures\n\n\n                                              26\n\frequired by [the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment],” US Const, Am\n\nXIV. Goss v Lopez, 419 US 565, 574; 95 S Ct 729; 42 L Ed 2d 725 (1975);14 see also\n\nBirdsey, 130 Mich App at 726 (applying Goss). Accordingly, plaintiffs certainly cannot\n\nseek expulsion of students in the present proceeding, where the students are not\n\nrepresented and have no opportunity to contest plaintiffs’ allegations against them. Goss,\n\n419 US at 579.      Yet the majority permits plaintiffs to proceed, thereby rendering\n\nadditional lawsuits—brought by the expelled students claiming violation of their rights—\n\ninevitable.\n\n    5. CONCLUSION: PLAINTIFFS CLEARLY LACK STANDING AND THE\n  MAJORITY’S CONCLUSIONTO THE CONTRARY ILLUSTRATES THE FATAL\n          PROBLEMS WITH ITS NEW APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n       Plaintiffs have not borne their burden to show that they satisfy any of the\n\napplicable requirements for standing under Lee, as both lower courts correctly concluded.\n\nPlaintiffs have not shown that MCL 380.1311a(1) creates a legally protected and\n\nredressable interest in teachers for which the courts may provide relief, particularly in a\n\ncase involving only the teachers and the school district, but not the students at issue.\n\nFurther, the foregoing discussion shows that plaintiffs could not satisfy any meaningful\n\nstanding test.\n\n       Indeed, plaintiffs could not assert standing even under the former tests the\n\nmajority cites with approval. Significantly, the parties essentially agree that the outcome\n\n\n       14\n           Goss applies because Michigan maintains a public school system, Const 1963,\nart 8, § 2, and requires children to attend, MCL 380.1561. See Goss, 419 US at 574.\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\fhere would be the same whether standing is analyzed under Lee, Detroit Fire Fighters,\n\n449 Mich 629, or House Speaker v Governor, 443 Mich 560; 506 NW2d 190 (1993). We\n\nagree. First, as discussed above, we see no indication that the Legislature intended to\n\ncreate a right or “substantial interest” in plaintiffs, see House Speaker, 443 Mich at 572,\n\nby enacting MCL 380.1311a(1). Further, to the extent plaintiffs refer to their general\n\ninterest in their personal safety while at work, this interest is separate and independent\n\nfrom the student discipline provisions of the Revised School Code; plaintiffs can protect\n\nthis interest through all the normal channels, including contract negotiations and\n\ncomplaints to local law enforcement. Second, plaintiffs’ general interest in a safe school\n\nenvironment is analogous to the safety interests claimed by the plaintiffs in Detroit Fire\n\nFighters, where Justice WEAVER agreed that the plaintiff firefighters and their collective\n\nbargaining unit did not have standing to challenge an alleged violation of the Detroit City\n\nCharter. Detroit Fire Fighters, 449 Mich at 631-632. Justice WEAVER concluded that\n\nthe firefighters did not have a “substantial interest” that “will be detrimentally affected in\n\na manner different from the public at large” although they claimed that lack of funding\n\nfor additional firefighters subjected them to increased risk of injury, among other things.\n\nId. at 633 (opinion by WEAVER, J.). Specifically, she opined that the plaintiffs could not\n\nshow “injury distinct from the general citizenry” because a lack of firefighters also\n\nthreatened injury to members of the general public who occupied buildings that catch\n\nfire. Id. at 638. The Legislature’s purported interests in ensuring safe and effective\n\nlearning environments similarly benefit the public at large. Safe schools, and the removal\n\nof violent students when appropriate, benefit not only all employees, volunteers,\n\n\n                                             28\n\fcontractors and students, but also parents, families, and any other member of the public\n\nwho has occasion to enter a school. Indeed, the entire community that supports a school\n\nsystem has “an interest” in school safety: safe school environments benefit taxpayers,\n\nwho fund all aspects of school functions. Although not every member of the public is\n\naffected equally by school environments, the same was true in Detroit Fire Fighters;\n\nclearly not every member of the public frequently finds himself at risk inside a burning\n\nbuilding, and clearly firefighters find themselves inside burning buildings more often\n\nthan other individual citizens.15\n\n       Yet the majority rejects this Court’s standing test and concludes, without any\n\nexamination of the school code or the ramifications for students’ constitutional rights,\n\nthat plaintiffs—and, by necessary analogy, all school employees, contractors, volunteers\n\nand fellow students—have standing. As I have explained, the school code is replete with\n\nclear indications that the Legislature did not intend to create a right of action in teachers\n\nunder MCL 380.1311a(1) and intended for the school code to be enforced under MCL\n\n380.1804 and MCL 380.1806. The majority concludes otherwise by simply observing\n\nthat MCL 380.1311a “suggests that plaintiffs have a substantial and distinct interest.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) Then, without citation and contrary to the most essential tenet of\n\nstatutory interpretation, the majority expressly departs from the statutory text and states\n\n       15\n          Most critically, the disciplinary provisions of the school code name not just\nteachers, but all employees, contractors, volunteers and students. The statutory language\nnowhere suggests that the Legislature intended for all these subclasses of the public to\nbring their individual complaints concerning school boards’ disciplinary proceedings to\nthe courthouse.\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fthat, although the Legislature has not unambiguously expressed an intent to confer\n\nstanding, a court may confer standing by consulting legislative history at will.16 This\n\nassertion is indisputably erroneous. The proper interpretation of a statute always begins\n\nwith the unambiguous statutory text. As this Court recently affirmed in a unanimous\n\nopinion authored by Chief Justice KELLY, the “first step” in discerning the intent of the\n\nLegislature “is to review the language of the statute.” Briggs Tax Service, LLC v Detroit\n\nPublic Schools, 485 Mich 69, 76; 780 NW2d 753 (2010). “[W]e consider both the plain\n\nmeaning of the critical word or phrase as well as “‘its placement and purpose in the\n\nstatutory scheme.’” Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, 460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119\n\n(1999) (citation omitted). If the statutory language is unambiguous, we presume that the\n\nLegislature intended the meaning expressed in the statute. Briggs Tax Service, 485 Mich\n\nat 76.       Accordingly, as Justice CAVANAGH himself stated in In re MCI\n\nTelecommunications Complaint, 460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999), “judicial\n\nconstruction is neither required nor permissible.” (Emphasis added.) Further, there has\n\nsimply never been any question that, to determine whether the Legislature intended to\n\nconfer standing under a particular statute, we employ the normal rules of statutory\n\ninterpretation and proceed by “analyz[ing] the statutory language.” Miller, 481 Mich at\n\n607, 610.\n\n      Therefore, as in all cases requiring us to interpret an unambiguous statute, resort to\n\nlegislative history is inappropriate. In re Certified Question from US Court of Appeals\n\n      16\n            Ante at ___ n 26.\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\ffor Sixth Circuit, 468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003). Further, even when\n\nreference to legislative history is appropriate, staff analyses created within the legislative\n\nbranch “are entitled to little judicial consideration” because “[i]n no way can a\n\n‘legislative analysis’ be said to officially summarize the intentions of those who have\n\nbeen designated by the Constitution to be participants in this legislative process, the\n\nmembers of the House and the Senate and the Governor.” Id.17 Indeed, the legislative\n\nanalysis cited here expressly states: “This analysis was prepared by nonpartisan Senate\n\nstaff for use by the Senate in its deliberations and does not constitute an official statement\n\nof legislative intent.” Enrolled Analysis of SB 0183, SB 0206, HB 4240 and HB 4241,\n\nJuly 21, 1999 (emphasis added).\n\n       Thus, the majority grants plaintiffs standing in direct derogation of the\n\nLegislature’s text and without any attention to the actual rights and remedies at stake,\n\nwhich include the constitutional rights of the unrepresented students. The majority’s\n\napplication of its vague new test demonstrates the test’s unprincipled nature and far-\n\nreaching consequences. This Court’s opinion in Lee was aimed precisely at avoiding\n\nsuch consequences by acknowledging that courts do not have unfettered discretion to\n\ngrant or deny standing at will, but should adhere to a common standard. A common\n\nstandard prevents the expansion of the judicial power beyond its constitutional bounds\n\n\n       17\n         Further, contrary to the majority’s characterization of such analyses, clearly the\npre-enactment statements of a legislative staffer are by no means comparable to\nstatements made by official, voting delegates to our constitutional convention, which I\nreference below.\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fwhich, in turn, protects both the rights of citizens and the separate purviews of the other\n\nbranches of government.\n\n          II. LEE WAS CORRECTLY DECIDED AND ITS ARTICULATION\n                  OF STANDING IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT\n              OF THIS STATE’S CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE\n\n       Relying on decades of developments in federal courts, the United States Supreme\n\nCourt in Lujan set forth three elements so basic to the concept of what is needed for any\n\nparty to bring a lawsuit that it labeled this standard the “irreducible constitutional\n\nminimum” of federal standing jurisprudence. 504 US at 560. First, a party wishing to\n\nbring a suit must have suffered a concrete and actual or imminent injury. Second, there\n\nmust be a fairly traceable causal connection between the injury and the defendant’s\n\nconduct. And third, a legal decision in favor of the party must be likely to redress the\n\nharm. Id. at 560-561. By nearly unanimous vote, this Court’s decision in Lee expressly\n\nincorporated this “irreducible constitutional minimum” into our state’s existing standing\n\njurisprudence, Lee, 464 Mich at 740, in an effort to identify when the courts have the\n\nauthority to exercise “[t]he judicial power of the state.” Const 1963, art 6, § 1. Because\n\nthe doctrine of standing touches every civil lawsuit brought in this state, it is a doctrine of\n\nthe utmost importance, with serious constitutional and practical implications.\n\n       Unfortunately, none of these considerations has deterred the majority in this case\n\nfrom reducing Michigan’s standing requirements from the clear, developed standards\n\narticulated in Lee and its progeny to a broad and amorphous principle that promises to be\n\nnearly impossible to apply in a society that operates under the rule of law. The majority\n\ndoes so by relying on arguments and legal theories that have been considered and rejected\n\n\n                                              32\n\fas inconsistent with Michigan’s constitutional requirements. The majority also does so\n\nnotwithstanding that Lee and its progeny provided Michigan with a clear, well-\n\nunderstood standing framework that clarified the law for the better by identifying the\n\nproper scope of judicial authority. The majority today upends and reverses this entire\n\nbody of Michigan law in vindication of the personal views of the majority justices, but to\n\nthe detriment of this state’s constitutional jurisprudence.\n\n     A. STANDING IS A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT IN MICHIGAN\n\n       The Michigan Constitution both separates the powers of the various branches of\n\ngovernment and limits the power of the judicial branch to hear cases when actual disputes\n\nexist. Thus, standing is a constitutional requirement. Because the Constitution vests\n\n“[t]he judicial power of the state . . . exclusively in one court of justice,” Const 1963, art\n\n6, § 1, the source and boundary of this power is constitutional in nature. Lee therefore\n\nproperly held that federal constitutional standards regarding standing may serve as a\n\nbenchmark in Michigan.\n\n       Perhaps the most fundamental doctrine in American political and constitutional\n\nthought is the separation of powers of government into a tripartite system. This principle\n\nhas been explicitly incorporated in Michigan’s constitutions.18          The importance of\n\ndistribution of power is reaffirmed explicitly in our current Constitution, which states:\n\n\n       18\n          See, e.g., Const 1908, art 4, § 1 (“The powers of government are divided into\nthree departments: The legislative, executive and judicial.”); id. at art 4, § 2 (“No person\nbelonging to 1 department shall exercise the powers properly belonging to another,\nexcept in the cases expressly provided in this constitution.”).\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f“The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and\n\njudicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly\n\nbelonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.”19 Const\n\n1963, art 3, § 2. There can be no doubt, then, that the scope of the judiciary’s power is\n\nboth created and constrained by Michigan’s Constitution.\n\n       The Lee Court did not newly create this constitutional principle out of whole cloth.\n\nContrary to the majority’s belief, and inconvenient to the majority’s conclusion,\n\nMichigan has consistently acknowledged that the state’s constitution limits the judicial\n\npower to hearing disputes involving actual cases or controversies. Understanding this\n\nmost basic of principles is imperative to defining what, precisely, this state’s doctrine\n\nregarding “standing” should be because there is a clear link between the doctrine of\n\nstanding and the separation of powers. The United States Supreme Court made this clear\n\nin Allen v Wright, 468 US 737; 104 S Ct 3315; 82 L Ed 2d 556 (1984):\n\n              The requirement of standing . . . has a core component derived\n       directly from the Constitution. . . .\n\n                                       * * *\n\n              . . . [T]he law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic idea—the\n       idea of separation of powers. . . .\n\n\n\n       19\n          The Michigan Constitution also explicitly provides that the Legislature is to\nexercise the “legislative power” of the state, Const 1963, art 4, § 1, the Governor is to\nexercise the “executive power,” Const 1963, art 5, § 1, and the judiciary is to exercise the\n“judicial power,” Const 1963, art 6, § 1.\n\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f             . . . [Q]uestions . . . relevant to the standing inquiry must be\n      answered by reference to the Art. III notion that federal courts may exercise\n      power only “in the last resort, and as a necessity,” and only when\n      adjudication is “consistent with a system of separated powers and [the\n      dispute is one] traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the\n      judicial process.” [Id. at 751-752, quoting Chicago & G T R Co v Wellman,\n      143 US 339, 345; 12 S Ct 400; 36 L Ed 176 (1892), and Flast v Cohen, 392\n      US 83, 97; 88 S Ct 1942; 20 L Ed 2d 947 (1968).]\n\nThe Court reaffirmed this principle in Lewis v Casey, 518 US 343, 349; 116 S Ct 2174;\n\n135 L Ed 2d 606 (1996), stating that “the doctrine of standing [is] a constitutional\n\nprinciple that prevents courts of law from undertaking tasks assigned to the political\n\nbranches.” In applying these principles as articulated in the Michigan Constitution, we\n\nhave previously explained:\n\n             As part of this endeavor to preserve separation of powers, the\n      judiciary must confine itself to the exercise of the “judicial power” and the\n      “judicial power” alone. “Judicial power” is an undefined phrase in our\n      constitution, but we noted in Nat'l Wildlife that\n\n      “[t]he judicial power has traditionally been defined by a combination of\n      considerations: the existence of a real dispute, or case or controversy; the\n      avoidance of deciding hypothetical questions; the plaintiff who has suffered\n      real harm; the existence of genuinely adverse parties; the sufficient ripeness\n      or maturity of a case; the eschewing of cases that are moot at any stage of\n      their litigation; the ability to issue proper forms of effective relief to a\n      party; the avoidance of political questions or other non-justiciable\n      controversies; the avoidance of unnecessary constitutional issues; and the\n      emphasis upon proscriptive as opposed to prescriptive decision making.”\n      [471 Mich at 614-615.]\n\n             We went on in Nat'l Wildlife to distill this litany of considerations\n      arising from the proper exercise of the “judicial power,” and we determined\n      that “the most critical element” is “its requirement of a genuine case or\n      controversy between the parties, one in which there is a real, not a\n      hypothetical, dispute.” [Nestlé Waters, 479 Mich at 292-293 (brackets in\n      original).]\n\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\f       Moreover, these basic principles have been affirmed time and again by Michigan\n\ncourts, as this Court traced in Lee:\n\n              Concern with maintaining the separation of powers, as in the federal\n       courts, has caused this Court over the years to be vigilant in preventing the\n       judiciary from usurping the powers of the political branches. Early on, the\n       great constitutional scholar Justice THOMAS M. COOLEY discussed the\n       concept of separation of powers in the context of declining to issue a\n       mandamus against the Governor in Sutherland v Governor, 29 Mich 320,\n       324 (1874):\n\n              “Our government is one whose powers have been carefully\n       apportioned between three distinct departments, which emanate alike from\n       the people, have their powers alike limited and defined by the constitution,\n       are of equal dignity, and within their respective spheres of action equally\n       independent. One makes the laws, another applies the laws in contested\n       cases, while the third must see that the laws are executed. This division is\n       accepted as a necessity in all free governments, and the very apportionment\n       of power to one department is understood to be a prohibition of its exercise\n       by either of the others. The executive is forbidden to exercise judicial\n       power by the same implication which forbids the courts to take upon\n       themselves his duties.”\n\n       This position followed from the even earlier iteration of the standing\n       doctrine by Justice CAMPBELL in 1859 when, speaking for this Court, he\n       said:\n\n               “By the judicial power of courts is generally understood the power to\n        hear and determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in\n        litigation.” [Daniels v People, 6 Mich 381, 388 (1859) (emphasis added).]\n\n              Later, in Risser v Hoyt, 53 Mich 185, 193; 18 NW 611 (1884), this\n       Court explained:\n\n             “The judicial power referred to is the authority to hear and decide\n       controversies, and to make binding orders and judgments respecting them.”\n       [Emphasis added.]\n\n       More recently, Johnson v Kramer Bros Freight Lines, Inc, 357 Mich 254,\n       258; 98 NW2d 586 (1959), reaffirmed this concept by quoting this portion\n       of Risser. [Lee, 464 Mich at 737-738 (brackets in original).]\n\n\n\n\n                                            36\n\f       And this history is certainly not exhaustive. For example, in 1920 this Court relied\n\non the separation of powers and the development of judicial power in declaring\n\nunconstitutional a statute that would have conferred standing upon citizens to invoke the\n\njurisdiction of the courts “not in the determination of actual controversies where rights\n\nhave been invaded and wrongs have been done, but in the giving of advice to all who\n\nmay seek it.” Anway v Grand Rapids R Co, 211 Mich 592, 606; 179 NW 350 (1920).\n\nThe Court explained:\n\n              This court and the court from which this case came by appeal draw\n       their power from the Constitution. The power given to both under the\n       Constitution was judicial power. . . . This act confers powers not judicial\n       and requires performance of acts non-judicial in character. For these\n       reasons it is void in its entirety. [Id. at 622.]\n\nFollowing the decision in Anway, the Legislature amended the act to remove the\n\noffending provisions that had allowed courts to exercise powers outside of the case and\n\ncontroversy context, and this Court upheld the revised act in Washington-Detroit Theatre\n\nCo v Moore, 249 Mich 673; 229 NW 618 (1930). Notably, the Court found significant\n\nthat the act had been amended to apply “only to ‘cases of actual controversy.’” Id. at\n\n676. It concluded that “[t]here must be an actual and bona fide controversy as to which\n\nthe judgment will be res adjudicata. Such a case requires that all the interested parties\n\nshall be before the court.” Id. at 677.\n\n       In House Speaker v State Admin Bd, 441 Mich 547, 556; 495 NW2d 539 (1993),\n\nthis Court again recognized the indisputable relationship between standing and the\n\nseparation of powers, holding that “[i]t would be imprudent and violative of the doctrine\n\nof separation of powers to confer standing upon a legislator simply for failing in the\n\n\n                                            37\n\fpolitical process.” More recently, in Federated Publications, Inc v City of Lansing, 467\n\nMich 98; 649 NW2d 383 (2002), we reaffirmed and explicitly declared that the “principal\n\nduty of this Court is to decide actual cases and controversies.” Id. at 112, citing Anway,\n\n211 Mich at 610, and In re Midland Publishing Co, Inc, 420 Mich 148, 152 n 2; 362\n\nNW2d 580 (1984). As this history makes clear, Michigan has consistently acknowledged\n\nthat our state constitution limits the judicial power to hearing cases involving actual cases\n\nor controversies.\n\n       This is true notwithstanding the lack of an explicit “case or controversy”\n\nrequirement in the Michigan Constitution. Indeed, exceptions to the general “case or\n\ncontroversy” limitation on judicial power have been explicitly made in the text of our\n\nConstitution itself, thereby recognizing the rule that a case or controversy is otherwise\n\nrequired. For example, Const 1963, art 9, § 32, confers upon “any taxpayer of the state”\n\nstanding to bring suit to enforce the provisions of the Headlee Amendment. Const 1963,\n\nart 11, § 5, empowers “any citizen of the state” to bring injunctive or mandamus\n\nproceedings to enforce the civil service laws of the state. Perhaps most significantly,\n\nConst 1963, art 3, § 8, allows either house of the Legislature to request that this Court\n\nissue an advisory opinion on the “constitutionality of legislation.”\n\n       Indeed, the delegates’ discussion of this last section, when it was ratified at the\n\nConstitutional Convention, eliminates any doubt about the framers’ understanding of the\n\njudicial power in Michigan and directly confirms the Lee Court’s interpretation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\fjudicial power.20 In considering whether the Court should have the power to issue\n\nadvisory opinions in nonadversarial proceedings at the request of other branches of\n\ngovernment, the delegates’ entire discussion was clearly premised on the unquestioned\n\nassumption that the judicial power, generally, was rooted in a case or controversy\n\nrequirement. At the outset, Delegate Harold Norris explicitly asked with regard to the\n\nproposed section: “Does that mean that as far as this committee is concerned, they do not\n\nwish to preserve the traditional notion that there must be a case or controversy presented\n\nbefore the court may exercise its judicial power?” 1 Official Record, Constitutional\n\nConvention 1961, p 1544 (emphasis added). When the question was raised whether the\n\npower to issue an advisory opinion would be equivalent to the courts’ preexisting power\n\nto issue declaratory judgments, Delegate Eugene Wanger similarly specified that the\n\ncourts’ preexisting power, even in the arena of declaratory judgments, distinctly required\n\n“an actual controversy between individuals . . . .” Id. at 1545. Delegate Raymond King\n\nmay have expressed the understanding most clearly when he remarked:\n\n               We are indeed contemplating a very serious change in what I think\n       to be the history and the tradition of justice in this country. Mr. Wanger\n       has pointed out the troubles that the Massachusetts supreme court got into\n       when they allowed themselves to leave the theory of case and controversy.\n       [Id. at 1546 (emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n       20\n          It is appropriate to consult constitutional convention debates when, as here, “‘we\nfind in the debates a recurring thread of explanation binding together the whole of a\nconstitutional concept.’” Studier v Michigan Public School Employees’ Retirement Bd,\n472 Mich 642, 656; 698 NW2d 350, (2005), quoting Univ of Michigan Regents v\nMichigan, 395 Mich 52, 60; 235 NW2d 1 (1975).\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\fIndeed, even with regard to the limited expansion21 of judicial power represented by the\n\nproposed advisory opinion provision, delegates were expressly concerned that it would\n\n“adversely affect[] the separation of powers doctrine . . . .” Id. at 1545 (Delegate\n\nWanger); and see id. at 1546 (Delegate Jack Faxon indicating that the convention “should\n\nbe wary of any violation of the separation of powers”); id. at 1547 (Delegate King\n\nstating: “I think we have established through the English common law and our adherence\n\nthereto a system of justice, a system of separation of powers which has proven itself, and\n\nI think we ought to be very reluctant at this time to try something new.”).\n\n       The framers’ discussion on these points reinforces the Lee Court’s understanding\n\nof the judicial power and presaged the critical problems—which I express here and which\n\nhave been expressed by my colleagues in the past—with expanding the judicial power\n\nbeyond its traditional limit. It also reinforces our conclusion, in Nat'l Wildlife that\n\n       [t]o the extent that the people of Michigan, through their constitution, have\n       chosen to confer upon the judiciary three specific authorities potentially\n       beyond the traditional “judicial power,” it seems unlikely that the people\n       intended that any other such nontraditional authority could simply be\n       incorporated as part of the “judicial power” by a simple majority of the\n       Legislature. [471 Mich at 625.]\n\n\n       21\n          The delegates agreed that the constitutional advisory opinion provision was\nunique and intended to be very limited. For example, Delegate Wanger observed: “It\nhas been emphasized by everyone supporting the advisory opinion practice that the courts\nwill exercise restraint, that they will be very careful not to answer every question that is\nasked but merely to answer those which are of a very, very vital nature.” Id. at 1548.\nDelegate Robert Danhof expressed a similar concern, advocating that the language of the\nprovision should include “an admonition to the supreme court that it is desirable that this\nparticular power be exercised very sparingly and, just as we mean, only upon the most\nsolemn occasions upon very important questions of law.” Id. at 1549.\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f       In sum, it is clear that the framers of Michigan’s constitution believed, first, that\n\nthe judicial power is generally circumscribed by the case or controversy requirement and,\n\nsecond, that the only way to expand judicial power beyond the traditional case or\n\ncontroversy limitation was through affirmative amendment of the constitution. In accord,\n\nthis Court has held that the constitutional standing test articulated in Lee must not be\n\napplied to limit judicial power otherwise expressly conferred in the Michigan\n\nConstitution. See Mich Coalition of State Employee Unions v Mich Civil Service Comm,\n\n465 Mich 212, 217-219; 634 NW2d 692 (2001).\n\n       Yet, since the decision in Lee, several members of the current majority have\n\nadvanced the view that, because the Michigan Constitution does not expressly use the\n\nwords “case” and “controversy” like the federal constitution, Michigan has no\n\nconstitutional standing requirement. This argument fundamentally misunderstands both\n\nthe Michigan and federal constitutions and misapprehends the constitutional standing\n\ntheory. In Nat'l Wildlife we explained that the provisions of the federal constitution\n\ndescribing the limited “cases” and “controversies” that federal courts have the power to\n\nhear\n\n       is not a definitional provision that seeks to give meaning to the “judicial\n       power.” Rather, art III, § 2 is a provision defining the limited judicial\n       power of the federal judiciary, in contrast to the plenary judicial power of\n       the state judiciary. The respective legislative articles of the two\n       constitutions are analogous to the judicial articles: the legislative article of\n       the Michigan Constitution does not purport to define the authority of its\n       Legislature (for example, nothing is said therein concerning its authority\n       over marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, alimony, or foster\n       care), while the legislative article of the federal constitution does\n       affirmatively confer authority upon the Congress, article I, § 8. The state\n       judicial power, as with the state legislative power, is plenary, requiring no\n\n\n                                             41\n\f      affirmative grant of authority in the state Constitution. The federal judicial\n      power, on the other hand, as with the federal legislative power, is limited.\n      Such power is exclusively a function, or a creation, of the federal\n      constitution, and, therefore, must be affirmatively set forth. In similar\n      fashion, the federal judicial power must also be affirmatively set forth, for it\n      is also a function, or creation, of the federal constitution. Thus, U.S.\n      Const., art. III, § 2 does not define the “judicial power;” rather it defines\n      what part of the “judicial power” within the United States belongs to the\n      federal judiciary, with the remaining part belonging exclusively to the state\n      judiciary. That art. III, § 2 variously employs the terms “cases” or\n      “controversies” is not to confer a particular meaning upon the “judicial\n      power,” but merely is to employ words that are necessary to the syntax of\n      allocating the “judicial power” between the federal and state governments.\n      The concurrence/dissents would confuse the allocation of a power with its\n      definition, and would thereby define the federal “judicial power” in the\n      narrowest possible manner by limiting it through reference alone to the\n      existence of a “case.” Even from the perspective of the\n      concurrence/dissents, is there no more permanent aspect of the “judicial\n      power” than that it pertain to a “case”?\n\n             In fact, the “judicial power” in the Michigan Constitution, with the\n      several exceptions enumerated [explicitly in the Constitution], is the same\n      “judicial power” as in the federal constitution, and it is the same “judicial\n      power” that has informed the practice of both federal and state judiciaries\n      for centuries. These historical principles were recognized by Lee, and we\n      continue to adhere to them today. [Nat'l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 626-628.22]\n\n      22\n         In Nestlé Waters, we further rejected this argument when a party argued that the\nLegislature had conferred statutory standing on it, which should be sufficient even if the\nparty could not meet the basic strictures of constitutional standing. We stated:\n\n             Justice WEAVER persists in her argument that the textual differences\n      between the federal constitution and our state constitution prove that the\n      exercise of “judicial power” or the doctrine of separation of powers in our\n      constitution means something radically different than it does under the\n      federal constitution. This argument that separation of powers should be\n      understood differently in the Michigan Constitution because the words\n      “case” and “controversy” are not in our constitution suggests to us that\n      Justice WEAVER fundamentally misunderstands the doctrine of separation\n      of powers. She refuses to accept that there is a constitutional limit on the\n      Legislature’s authority to expand “judicial power” in the area of standing.\n      In response, we stated in Nat'l Wildlife that “[a]s the Michigan Constitution\n\n\n                                            42\n\fYet this argument that Michigan does not have a constitutional basis for its standing\n\ntest—based on “caricatured textualism” that has been handily rejected—persists\n\nnonetheless.23   In particular, Justice WEAVER has championed this dubious theory,\n\n\n       makes clear, the duty of the judiciary is to exercise the ‘judicial power,’\n       and, in so doing, to respect the separation of powers. While as a general\n       proposition, the proper exercise of the ‘judicial power’ will obligate the\n       judiciary to give faithful effect to the words of the Legislature—for it is the\n       latter that exercises the ‘legislative power,’ not the judiciary—such effect\n       cannot properly be given when to do so would contravene the constitution\n       itself. Just as the judicial branch owes deference to the legislative branch\n       when the ‘legislative power’ is being exercised, so too does the legislative\n       branch owe deference to the judicial branch when the exercise of the\n       ‘judicial power’ is implicated. Even with the acquiescence of the\n       legislative and executive branches, the judicial branch cannot arrogate to\n       itself governmental authority that is beyond the scope of the ‘judicial\n       power’ under the constitution. The ‘textual’ approach of [Justice WEAVER]\n       is a caricatured textualism, in which the Legislature is empowered to act\n       beyond its authority in conferring powers upon other branches that are also\n       beyond their authority.” [Nat'l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 637 (citations omitted;\n       emphasis in original).] [Nestlé Waters, 479 Mich at 307-308.]\n       23\n           The majority cites Washington-Detroit Theatre Co, 249 Mich 673, for the\nproposition that “this Court long ago explained that Michigan courts’ judicial power to\ndecide controversies was broader than the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation\nof the Article III case-or-controversy limits on the federal judicial power because a state\nsovereign possesses inherent powers that the federal government does not.” This is\nprecisely correct, but not in the way the majority applies it. In fact, it actually\nundermines the majority’s conclusion. The majority here either fails to understand or\nwillfully ignores the fact that the federal “case or controversy” requirement limits only\nthe range of controversies that may be heard in federal courts, and that this is distinct\nfrom the requirement that an actual case or controversy exists in the first place. In short,\nthat Michigan courts may decide types of controversies that the federal courts lack\nauthority to decide does not mean that Michigan has no constitutional threshold for when\na plaintiff may bring such a controversy. The Lee/Lujan standing test does not govern\nwhat types of cases/controversies may be brought, only whether a case/controversy exists\nin the first instance.\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\fwhich—given Chief Justice KELLY’s and Justice CAVANAGH’s recent metamorphoses on\n\nthe issue of standing, and Justice HATHAWAY’s election to the Court—presents a\n\nconvenient argument as the majority grasps at straws to explain why Lee and its progeny\n\nshould be overruled. The fact remains that in neither the majority opinion in this case,\n\nnor any of the majority justices’ concurring or dissenting opinions in prior cases, has a\n\nmember of the majority ever articulated a sufficient response to these serious criticisms.\n\nThis case has greater significance than prior cases, however, because the majority\n\nproceeds on these false understandings in order to remove altogether the limits imposed\n\nby our Constitution.\n\n       The proposition that Michigan courts are limited by an actual case or controversy\n\nrequirement is beyond reproach. Michigan’s case or controversy requirement is not\n\ndrawn from the federal “case or controversy” language, but rather the parallel limitations\n\nimposed in Michigan’s own constitution. This fact has been recognized by more than a\n\ncentury worth of Michigan caselaw, and thus it formed the basis for this Court’s decision\n\nin Lee to incorporate a standing test that reflected this reality. The majority’s author need\n\nonly read his own opinions to realize as much. For example, in People v Richmond, this\n\nCourt recently reaffirmed that “it is the ‘principal duty of this Court . . . to decide actual\n\ncases and controversies.’ That is, ‘“[t]he judicial power . . . is the right to determine\n\nactual controversies arising between adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper\n\njurisdiction.”’”   486 Mich 29, 34; 782 NW2d 187 (2010) (majority opinion by\n\nCAVANAGH, J.) (citations omitted, emphasis added, ellipsis and brackets in original),\n\n\n\n\n                                             44\n\fciting Federated Publications, 467 Mich at 112, and Anway, 211 Mich at 610, 616.24\n\nThese principles apply with as much force in ensuring that this Court does not hear moot\n\ncases, or controversies that are not yet ripe.25 More generally, one has to wonder whether\n\nthe majority may also wish to overrule all Michigan cases that rely on federal precedent\n\ninvolving standing’s sister doctrines of mootness and ripeness? If not, the majority is left\n\n\n       24\n           In Richmond, three members of the current majority held that the prosecutor’s\ncase was moot, and therefore did not present an actual case and controversy, although the\nprosecutor had an interest in appealing the trial court’s adverse evidentiary rulings before\nvoluntarily dismissing the charges. Here, plaintiffs have no recognized interest separate\nfrom that of the general public, and no private right of action to vindicate. Thus,\nironically, the majority is content to block certain parties from proceeding based on “case\nand controversy” grounds, while allowing other parties to proceed although they have no\nlegal interests. I can discern no pattern or method other than that the majority wishes to\nuse these cases as vehicles to overturn precedents with which it disagrees, or that it seeks\nto assist certain parties in achieving their political ends. Neither, of course, is legitimate.\n       25\n            As this Court explained in Michigan Chiropractic Council:\n\n              In seeking to make certain that the judiciary does not usurp the\n       power of coordinate branches of government, and exercises only ‘judicial\n       power,’ both this Court and the federal courts have developed justiciability\n       doctrines to ensure that cases before the courts are appropriate for judicial\n       action. These include the doctrines of standing, ripeness, and mootness.\n\n               Federal courts have held that doctrines such as standing and\n       mootness are constitutionally derived and jurisdictional in nature, because\n       failure to satisfy their elements implicates the court’s constitutional\n       authority to exercise only ‘judicial power’ and adjudicate only actual cases\n       or controversies. . . . Likewise, our case law has also viewed the doctrines\n       of justiciability as affecting ‘judicial power,’ the absence of which renders\n       the judiciary constitutionally powerless to adjudicate the claim. . . .\n\n                                               * * *\n\n              Thus, we reiterate that questions of justiciability concern the\n       judiciary’s constitutional jurisdiction to adjudicate cases containing a\n       genuine controversy. [475 Mich at 370-374 (emphasis in original).]\n\n\n                                              45\n\fin the intellectually inconsistent position of defending those bodies of case law, which\n\nhave the same constitutional foundation regarding justiciability as the standing principles\n\narticulated in Lujan and Lee. Indeed, these doctrines are based exclusively on the very\n\ncase or controversy requirement, implicit in the Michigan Constitution, that the majority\n\nhere rejects.\n\n       Like this Court in Lee, other courts have rejected the majority’s imprecise and\n\noverly broad analysis regarding the constitutional basis for standing on similar grounds.\n\nFor example, in Bennett v Napolitano, the Arizona Supreme Court recently stated:\n\n              Article VI of the Arizona Constitution, the judicial article, does not\n       contain the specific case or controversy requirement of the U.S.\n       Constitution. But, unlike the federal constitution in which the separation of\n       powers principle is implicit, our state constitution contains an express\n       mandate, requiring that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of\n       government be divided among the three branches and exercised separately.\n       This mandate underlies our own requirement that as a matter of sound\n       jurisprudence a litigant seeking relief in the Arizona courts must first\n       establish standing to sue. [206 Ariz 520, 525; 81 P3d 311 (2003).]\n\nThe majority’s flawed constitutional analysis allows it to advance the false dichotomy\n\nthat this state’s standing jurisprudence must be based either on prudential concerns or on\n\nconstitutional underpinnings, but not both. As the above analysis demonstrates, however,\n\nthe constitutional separation of powers constraints explicitly provided in Michigan’s\n\nConstitution give rise to minimal constitutional standing requirements, which this Court\n\nmay augment when additional, prudential concerns arise.26 Thus, the interpretation of\n\n\n       26\n         Cf. Travelers Ins Co v Detroit Edison Co, 465 Mich 185, 196; 631 NW2d 733\n(2001) (“Justiciability doctrines such as standing ‘relate in part, and in different though\noverlapping ways, to an idea, which is more than an intuition but less than a rigorous and\n\n\n                                            46\n\fMichigan’s constitution—in particular, its explicit limitations on judicial power and\n\nrequirements of an actual case or controversy—provides a direct basis for applying the\n\nprudent and well defined federal test.\n\n                       B. LEE AND ITS PROGENY:\n            CREATING CERTAINTY IN MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE\n\n       Although the concept of “standing” touches every civil action filed in this state,\n\nprior to the adoption of the Lujan standard in Michigan this Court had only produced a\n\ngeneral description of the principles governing standing. The most recent description that\n\ngarnered support from a majority of this Court is found in House Speaker v State Admin\n\nBd,27 which stated:\n\n              Standing is a legal term used to denote the existence of a party’s\n       interest in the outcome of litigation that will ensure sincere and vigorous\n       advocacy. However, evidence that a party will engage in full and vigorous\n       advocacy, by itself, is insufficient to establish standing. Standing requires a\n       demonstration that the plaintiff’s substantial interest will be detrimentally\n       affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large. [441 Mich at\n       554.]\n\nUnsurprisingly, such a general proposition for a doctrine as important and far-reaching as\n\nstanding proved difficult to apply. This fact became all too obvious in Detroit Fire\n\nFighters, when this Court next examined Michigan’s standing doctrine. Detroit Fire\n\nFighters resulted in a split decision in which no majority could be found to explain what\n\nexplicit theory, about the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an\nunelected, unrepresentative judiciary in our kind of government.’” Quoting Allen, 468\nUS at 750, quoting Vander Jagt v O’Neill, 226 US App DC 14, 26-27; 699 F2d 1166\n[1983] (Bork, J., concurring)).\n       27\n          House Speaker was decided by this Court before the United States Supreme\nCourt released its opinion in Lujan.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\felements were essential to standing in Michigan.28 Indeed, although all four opinions\n\ncited the same boilerplate language from House Speaker in support of their respective\n\npositions, the justices did not agree on such fundamental questions as what standing is in\n\nMichigan, what test should govern standing, and whether the plaintiffs had standing in\n\nthat particular case.29 This hodgepodge of disparate opinions compelled the Court to\n\nreach the merits of the case without a clear consensus on the threshold question whether\n\nthe plaintiffs even had standing to bring the case.\n\n       This background formed the context in which this Court again confronted this\n\nstate’s standing principles in Lee where, by a vote of six to one, this Court adopted and\n\nincorporated Lujan into our standing jurisprudence. As we stated then:\n\n               In our view, the Lujan test has the virtues of articulating clear\n       criteria and of establishing the burden of demonstrating these elements.\n       Moreover, its three elements appear to us to be fundamental to standing; the\n       United States Supreme Court described them as establishing the\n       “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing. We agree. [Lee, 464\n       Mich at 740.]\n\nConsistent with this Court’s constitutional obligations, the nearly unanimous majority in\n\nLee correctly noted that the Lujan test provides a practical and workable framework for\n       28\n         449 Mich 629, opinions by WEAVER, J. (lead opinion); CAVANAGH, J., joined\nby BOYLE, J. (concurring in part and dissenting part); RILEY, J., joined by BRICKLEY, C.J.\n(concurring); and MALLETT, J., joined by LEVIN, J. (concurring in the result only).\n       29\n          As this Court aptly summarized in Lee, among the various opinions in Detroit\nFire Fighters, “[s]ome focused on whether the plaintiff could establish an injury distinct\nfrom that of the public, others on whether the plaintiffs were in the zone of interest the\nstatutory or constitutional provision at issue is designed to regulate. Perhaps the clearest\ntemplate was set forward by Justice CAVANAGH, who, along with Justice BOYLE,\nadvocated adopting the United States Supreme Court’s Lujan test.” Lee, 464 Mich at\n739.\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\faddressing what was previously an amorphous and often difficult concept. In its most\n\nbasic form, the doctrine of standing can be properly reduced to the Lujan factors. What is\n\nstanding if not the requirement that a plaintiff either has suffered or is in imminent danger\n\nof suffering an actual harm, that the harm is allegedly caused by the defendant, and that\n\nthe result of the court’s action can redress the wrong or injury? While the federal and\n\nstate constitutions are not coterminous, they have developed on a parallel track, and the\n\ninterpretation of federal constitutional law may inform state constitutional law when they\n\nshare common elements. Although the majority has littered its opinion with instinctive\n\nrepetitions that this state’s standing jurisprudence is “prudential,” the majority cannot\n\nexplain what is imprudent about the “irreducible” and traditional description of the\n\nstanding doctrine articulated in Lujan.\n\n       By introducing an objective framework based on three well-developed and readily\n\nunderstandable criteria—injury in fact, causation, and redressability—the Lee decision\n\nsimplified and made more practical the doctrine of standing in this state. As is evidenced\n\nby how justices on this Court could not previously agree about what, exactly, standing\n\nmeant in Michigan under House Speaker, 443 Mich 560, the Lee framework provides\n\ncertainty. The progeny of Lee bear this out: in a decade’s worth of cases, Michigan trial\n\nand appellate courts have consistently and appropriately applied Michigan’s standing\n\ndoctrine.30   Indeed, during this time the doctrine itself has not changed.        Only the\n\n\n       30\n          See Lee, 464 Mich at 739-740 (incorporating the federal standing analysis\narticulated in Lujan into Michigan standing jurisprudence); Nat’l Wildlife, 471 Mich at\n628-629 (organizational standing and legislative authority to grant citizen standing);\n\n\n                                             49\n\fpersonal views of justices on this Court—and only those who now overrule a decade’s\n\nworth of cases—have changed.\n\n       As a matter of simple prudence and proper exercise of this Court’s constitutional\n\nauthority, this Court is empowered to create clear rules that are easily accessible and\n\napplicable in the future. Aside from ensuring that Michigan courts only hear genuine\n\ncases and controversies in accord with its constitutionally mandated judicial powers,\n\nadopting the well-defined Lujan test provides the additional benefit of ensuring that\n\nMichigan’s standing doctrine is guided by clearly articulated and well-developed rules.\n\nA well-understood and practical standing test serves to uphold the separation of powers\n\nand promote the sound administration of justice. Indeed, only such a framework can\n\nensure that courts will be governed by the rule of law, which itself ensures equality of\n\ntreatment under the law. Inexplicably, the majority apparently celebrates that, prior to\n\nLee, Michigan’s standing doctrine suffered from inconsistent application, and in some\n\ncases, was not analyzed or applied at all.31 Unfortunately, the majority’s test can promise\n\nno better in the future; this is particularly true since, by its explicit terms, standing can\n\nnow be determined at the “discretion” of trial courts.\n\n\n\n\nNestlé Waters, 479 Mich at 295-296, 302-303 (legislative authority to grant citizen\nstanding); Rohde, 479 Mich at 354-355, (taxpayer and qui tam standing); Michigan\nChiropractic, 475 Mich 363; Associated Builders & Contractors, 472 Mich 117 (standing\nnecessary in order to seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to MCR 2.605).\n       31\n            Ante, ___ n 3.\n\n\n\n                                             50\n\f       Notably, Lee did not supplant or “sacrifice” this Court’s standing jurisprudence, as\n\nthe majority in this case erroneously states. Rather, it adopted the Lujan test as a means\n\nof “supplementing the holding in House Speaker, as well as this Court’s earlier standing\n\njurisprudence, e.g., Daniels and Risser.” Lee, 464 Mich at 740 (emphasis added). The\n\nmajority today is not so kind. Characteristic of its reckless treatment of this Court’s\n\nprecedent and its willingness to rewrite entire areas of the law rather than letting them\n\ndevelop over time, the majority today jettisons a decade of this state’s caselaw, which\n\nitself was based on nearly a century of rules and principles developed by the United\n\nStates Supreme Court. And it does so in favor of what? A general, one paragraph\n\narticulation of “prudential” standing that proved so utterly unworkable a mere fifteen\n\nyears ago under House Speaker, 443 Mich 560. Michigan citizens deserve better from\n\ntheir highest court.\n\n       Reliance on the accessible and well-understood federal test was a proper and\n\nprudent course of action for this Court to take in Lee. Indeed, this Court has often\n\naffirmed the principle that it is not questioned that the “powers of Michigan’s\n\njudiciary . . . are modeled after the federal judiciary . . . .” Charles Reinhart Co v\n\nWiniemko, 444 Mich 579, 592 n 24; 513 NW2d 773 (1994) (opinion by RILEY, J.); see\n\nalso Nat'l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 627-628. This is particularly true in the context of\n\nstanding where “Michigan courts previously have relied upon federal authority when\n\ndeciding standing questions.” House Speaker, 441 Mich at 560 n 21. And Michigan is\n\nnot alone. Because states’ judicial powers are plenary whereas federal judicial power is\n\nlimited, no state in this country has an explicit “case or controversy” requirement in its\n\n\n                                            51\n\fconstitution analogous to that of the federal constitution. Nonetheless, nearly half the\n\nstates have adopted the Lujan test or its equivalent as their own in accordance with their\n\nstate constitutional requirements regarding standing.32 Like this Court in Lee, these states\n\n\n       32\n           E.g. the following states do not have an explicit “case or controversy”\nrequirement in their constitutions, yet have adopted or relied on the federal standing test\nas articulated in Lujan. Alabama—Stiff v Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd, 878\nSo 2d 1138, 1142 (Ala, 2003) (applying the Lujan test for standing); Alaska—Chenega\nCorp v Exxon Corp, 991 P2d 769, 785 (Alas, 1999) (recognizing Lujan); Arizona—\nBennett, 206 Ariz at 525 (noting that, although “[a]rticle VI of the Arizona Constitution,\nthe judicial article, does not contain the specific case or controversy requirement of the\nU.S. Constitution,” “federal case law [is] instructive” due to separation of powers\nprinciples and as a “matter of sound jurisprudence”); Connecticut—Gay & Lesbian Law\nStudents Ass’n v Bd of Trustees, 236 Conn 453, 466 n 10; 673 A2d 484 (1996) (stating\nthat “[t]here is little material difference between what we have required and what the\nUnited States Supreme Court in Lujan demanded of the plaintiff to establish standing”);\nDelaware—Dover Historical Society v City of Dover Planning Comm, 838 A2d 1103,\n1111 (Del, 2003) (noting that “[t]his Court has recognized that the Lujan requirements for\nestablishing standing under Article III to bring an action in federal court are generally the\nsame as the standards for determining standing to bring a case or controversy within the\ncourts of Delaware”); Georgia—Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc v City of\nRoswell, 283 Ga 417, 418; 658 SE2d 587 (2008) (recognizing Lujan as the appropriate\ntest for standing and noting that “[i]n addition to the constitutional requirements for\nstanding, there is a subset of ‘prudential’ standing requirements that have been developed\nby the United States Supreme Court”); Hawaii—Akinaka v Disciplinary Bd of Hawai’i\nSupreme Court, 91 Hawaii 51, 55; 979 P2d 1077 (1999) (utilizing a test comparable to\nthe Lujan test derived from federal caselaw); Idaho—Young v City of Ketchum, 137 Idaho\n102, 104; 44 P3d 1157 (2002); Iowa—Godfrey v State, 752 NW2d 413, 418 (Iowa, 2008)\n(noting that “our doctrine on standing parallels the federal doctrine,” and applying Lujan\nin the context of a public interest claim); Mississippi—Clark Sand Co v Kelly,___So 3d\n__ Miss __; 2010 Miss LEXIS 94 (2010) (utilizing the Lujan test); New Mexico—Forest\nGuardians v Powell, 130 NM 368, 375; 24 P3d 803 (NM App, 2001), quoting United\nFood & Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v Brown Group, Inc, 517 US 544, 551;\n116 S Ct 1529; 134 L Ed 2d 758 (1996) (quoting federal law and applying the same\nstanding criteria used in Lujan), and John Does I through III v Roman Catholic Church of\nthe Archdiocese of Santa Fe, Inc, 122 NM 307, 311-314; 924 P2d 273 (NM App,1996)\n(noting that “[i]t is not enough to establish standing that an identifiable interest has been\ninjured,” citing the federal definition of “injury in fact,” and concluding that although the\n“New Mexico Constitution does not speak of Cases or Controversies,” “we are aware of\n\n\n                                             52\n\frealize the wisdom behind the federal standing test and how it provides a practical and\n\nworkable standing framework that operates within the bounds of their similar\n\nconstitutional separation of powers requirements by giving meaning to those\n\nrequirements.

Indeed, with this case, the majority overrules those principles and\n\nrules that ensured that the doctrine would have articulated and meaningful limits in\n\nMichigan. Writing for the Court in Nat’l Wildlife, Justice MARKMAN foreshadowed the\n\nunfortunate turn of events altering Michigan’s standing jurisprudence that today has\n\ncome to pass:\n\n             By their diminishment of a traditional check and balance upon the\n      exercise of the ‘judicial power,’ the concurring/dissenting Justices\n      [CAVANAGH, KELLY, and WEAVER] would, if their position were ever to\n      gain a majority, inflict considerable injury upon our system of separation of\n      powers and the rule of law that it has produced. [Nat’l Wildlife, 471 Mich\n      at 628.]\n\nJustice HATHAWAY has now provided those justices with their fourth vote, and with it\n\nsurely will come the inevitable breakdown of the rule of law in the domain of standing\n\nthat only Lee and its progeny had stood athwart.\n\n\n      33\n           See, generally, Nat'l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 617-623.\n\n\n\n                                             54\n\f            III. THE MAJORITY’S SELF-SERVING AND INCONSISTENT\n                 APPROACH TO THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS\n\n       Finally, the far-reaching, deleterious impact of the majority’s decision in this case\n\nis equally inherent in its methods for overruling significant, precedential opinions of this\n\nCourt. The majority’s claim that it has good reason to overrule Lee and its progeny, in\n\ncontravention of the doctrine of stare decisis, is bankrupt and self-serving.         Most\n\nsignificantly, in jettisoning Lee, the four justices constituting the majority fail to apply\n\nany agreed-upon test to examine whether this change in law is justified. The only clear\n\ncommonality is their shared conclusion that Lee was clearly wrongly decided. This\n\nconclusion is mystifying because it is directly counter to the past positions of three\n\nmembers of the current majority, who supported Lee—and the case or controversy\n\nrequirement underpinning Lee—in previous cases. Finally, the majority’s determination\n\nthat overruling Lee will benefit the public depends entirely on circular, self-serving\n\nreasoning; the majority simply concludes that its preferred regime would better serve the\n\npublic without any attention to the actual desires of the Michigan public—as expressed,\n\nfor example, in the Michigan Constitution—or to the commonplace conclusion of courts\n\nthroughout the nation that the test articulated in Lujan well serves the nation’s courts and\n\ncitizens.\n\n                A. THE MAJORITY’S STANDARDLESS APPROACH\n                        TO OVERRULING PRECEDENT\n\n       In Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), this Court\n\narticulated several factors for consideration before a court should overrule established\n\nprecedent. “The first question, of course, should be whether the earlier decision was\n\n\n                                            55\n\fwrongly decided.” Id. at 464. But “the mere fact that an earlier case was wrongly\n\ndecided does not mean overruling it is invariably appropriate.” Id. at 465. Rather,\n\n“[c]ourts should also review whether the decision at issue defies ‘practical workability,’\n\nwhether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law\n\nor facts no longer justify the questioned decision.” Id. at 464.\n\n       The majority’s conclusion that Lee was wrongly decided is untenable. The test\n\nLee enunciated is loyal to the Michigan Constitution, is consistent with our jurisprudence,\n\nand has been adopted and successfully applied throughout the nation by states with\n\nconstitutions similar to our own. Next, there is no indication that the Lee test “defies\n\n‘practical workability,’” that “reliance interests would work an undue hardship,” or that\n\n“changes in the law or facts no longer justify” it. Robinson, 462 Mich at 464. To the\n\ncontrary, in standardizing factors for standing throughout the state based on the well-\n\nestablished and accepted federal test, Lee created a predictable analytic tool. It thus\n\nenhanced workability for courts and parties and protected parties’ interests from\n\npotentially unanticipated discretionary decisions of individual courts, which did not have\n\nthe benefit of concrete, guiding principles before Lee.\n\n       In jettisoning this Court’s constitutional standing jurisprudence, however, Justice\n\nCAVANAGH chooses not to rely on the Robinson factors. Instead, he cites Chief Justice\n\nKELLY’s analysis in Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300; 773 NW2d 564 (2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                             56\n\fThere, the Chief Justice expressed her disapproval of Robinson.34 Petersen, 484 Mich at\n\n316-317. She thus articulated her own preferred standard, albeit while “neglect[ing] even\n\nto apply her new stare decisis standard to determine whether Robinson itself should be\n\noverruled.”   Id. at 388 n 42 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting).       Only Justice CAVANAGH\n\nconcurred in the Chief Justice’s stare decisis analysis in Petersen, and only the Chief\n\nJustice expressly joins Justice CAVANAGH’s reliance on Petersen here.\n\n      In declining to join Justice CAVANAGH’s discussion of stare decisis, Justices\n\nWEAVER and HATHAWAY go one step further. In their concurrences, they expressly\n\nadvocate no standardized approach to overruling precedent. Concluding that “[t]here is\n\nno need for this Court to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis,” Justice\n\nWEAVER advocates for a “case-by-case” analysis based on undefined notions of “judicial\n\nrestraint, common sense, and fairness.” Her application of these notions to this case\n\nexemplifies the unprincipled nature of her position. She simply advances the empty,\n\ncircular conclusion: “In serving the rule of law and applying judicial restraint, common\n\nsense, and a sense of fairness to the case at hand, I agree with and join the majority\n\nopinion’s holding that Lee and its progeny are overruled.” Justice HATHAWAY describes\n\na judge’s duty when deciding whether to overrule precedent as a “policy determination”\n\nthat “will be dependent upon the facts and circumstances presented.”        Like Justice\n\n      34\n          Notably, Chief Justice KELLY concluded that “Robinson is insufficiently\nrespectful of precedent” and indicated that she “would modify it by shifting the balance\nback in favor of precedent.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 316-317. This allegiance to\nprecedent is remarkably absent in this case despite the majority’s reliance on Chief\nJustice KELLY’s Petersen formulation.\n\n\n\n                                           57\n\fWEAVER, she votes to overrule Lee based on an empty, unexplained conclusion: “the\n\nreasons for overruling Lee are paramount to any articulated test and the special and\n\ncompelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case.”\n\n      Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY have each espoused their troubling views that\n\nreviewing whether a case should be overruled is merely a “policy” determination that\n\nneed not be guided by any standard in several other recent cases, including Univ of\n\nMichigan Regents v Titan Ins Co, ___ Mich ___; ___ NW2d ___ (2010), and\n\nMcCormick, ___ Mich ___. Their professed approaches rely entirely on their personal,\n\nsubjective views of the law. As Justice YOUNG noted in his dissent to Univ of Mich\n\nRegents, their approaches are “the very antithesis of the ‘rule of law.’” ___ Mich at ___\n\n(YOUNG, J., dissenting). He observed:\n\n              The rule of law, by definition, requires judges to decide cases on the\n      basis of principles, announced in advance, rather than on a personal or\n      subjective preference for or against a party before them. This ensures\n      stability in the law despite the diversity of judges’ personal beliefs.\n      Whether we, as judges, “like” the outcome is, quite simply, irrelevant to\n      whether it reflects a correct conclusion of law. It is harrowing that Justices\n      WEAVER and HATHAWAY either do not understand this concept or refuse to\n      subscribe to it, preferring to base their decisions on subjective “policy\n      consideration[s].” [Id. at ___.]\n\nJustice MARKMAN also warned that the primary problem with this approach is that\n\n      “litigants will, of course, have no notice beforehand of which [‘analytical\n      approach’] will be employed, for the justices themselves will not know this\n      beforehand.” Under the concurring justices’ “analytical approaches,”\n\n      “there [would be] no consistently applied . . . process with which the judge\n      promises beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be “fair,” and\n      he or she may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is\n      to be achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each\n      [precedent] on a case-by-case basis, using whatever [‘policy\n\n\n                                            58\n\f        considerations’] he or she believes are required in that instance. And the\n        suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate\n        [‘policy considerations’] may be largely a function of the outcome\n        preferred by the judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the\n        parties and their causes.” [Id. (MARKMAN, J., dissenting), quoting\n        Petersen, 484 Mich at 381-382 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting).]\nThese warnings have come full circle in this case where the majority overrules an entire\n\nbody of law without relying on any agreed-upon factors to decide whether overruling\n\nprecedent is appropriate.\n\n                     B. AFTER SUPPORTING LEE IN THE PAST,\n                 THE MAJORITY NOW INEXPLICABLY CONCLUDES\n                        THAT IT WAS WRONGLY DECIDED\n\n        Significantly, the majority’s decision to overrule Lee under the various\n\n“standards” espoused individually by each justice depends, of course, on its threshold\n\nconclusion that Lee was wrongly decided. But this conclusion itself is belied by the\n\nreliance of Chief Justice KELLY, Justice WEAVER and Justice CAVANAGH on the wisdom\n\nof Lee.      Chief Justice KELLY and Justice CAVANAGH expressly joined the Court’s\n\nadoption of the Lujan test in Lee.      Lee, 464 Mich at 750 (KELLY, J., joined by\n\nCAVANAGH, J., dissenting but “agree[ing] with the majority’s adoption of the Lujan\n\ntest”).35    Indeed, Justice CAVANAGH was the first justice of this Court to propose\n\nadopting the Lujan test; he expressly employed and advocated for adoption of the Lujan\n\ntest in concluding that the plaintiffs had standing in the fractured Detroit Fire Fighters\n\ndecision. See 449 Mich at 651-652 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting in part). Justice WEAVER\n\n\n        35\n        See also Crawford, 466 Mich 256-257 (per curiam opinion relying on Lee in\nwhich CAVANAGH, J., concurred).\n\n\n\n                                           59\n\fherself accepted Lee in Associated Builders, 472 Mich at 127 & n 16, where she\n\nexplicitly held that Lee governs standing in declaratory actions and in cases where a\n\nplaintiff seeks to enforce an alleged statutory right but the statute does not confer\n\nstanding by its own terms. These justices have also explicitly affirmed their agreement\n\nwith the concept that the judicial power in Michigan is bounded by a case or controversy\n\nrequirement. E.g. Richmond, ___ Mich at ___ (CAVANAGH, J., joined by KELLY, CJ.,\n\nMARKMAN and HATHAWAY, JJ.); (‘“[t]he judicial power . . . is the right to determine\n\nactual controversies arising between adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper\n\njurisdiction”’”) (citations omitted; ellipsis and brackets in original); In re Certified\n\nQuestion from the United States Dist Court for Eastern Dist of Michigan, 622 NW2d\n\n518, 519 (2001) (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (“‘ [J]udicial power’” is “‘the power to hear\n\nand determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in litigation.’”)\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n      In light of these justices’ former positions, I am mystified at their current\n\nconclusions that Lee was not only wrongly decided, but was so misguided that we should\n\nnow throw Michigan’s standing jurisprudence into turmoil in order to overrule Lee.\n\nIndeed, their result has every appearance of a mere power grab intended to ascribe broad,\n\nunconstitutional authority to the Court as it is now configured with this new majority at\n\nthe helm. Ironically, Justice WEAVER’s dissenting comments in In re Certified Question\n\nfrom Fourteenth Dist Court of Appeals of Texas, 479 Mich 498; 740 NW2d 206 (2007),\n\nare apropos. There, she reiterated her lack of support for MCR 7.305(B), which permits\n\nthis Court to entertain requests for advisory opinions from foreign courts, because the\n\n\n                                            60\n\fsubrule “lacks any limiting language on when the Court may answer a certified\n\nquestion . . . .” Id. at 550 (WEAVER, J., dissenting). A lack of express limits, she opined,\n\n“leav[es] the door and the docket open to the whims of the majority.” Id.\n\n       As if to illustrate her point, the majority underpins its supposed consideration of\n\nthe doctrine of stare decisis with its conclusion that our constitutional standing doctrine is\n\n“at the expense of the public interest . . . because it may prevent litigants from enforcing\n\npublic rights, despite the presence of adverse interests and parties, and regardless of\n\nwhether the Legislature intended a private right of enforcement to be part of the statute’s\n\nenforcement scheme.”       But this self-serving, rhetorical formulation of the “public\n\ninterest” is entirely of the majority’s own making.36 It ignores that, in this case, there is\n\nno indication that the Legislature intended that plaintiffs have a private right to enforce\n\nthe statute at issue. Most significantly, it ignores the public’s interest as expressed in our\n\nconstitution, and explained in depth above, in courts that do not have unlimited power\n\nand, absent exceptions expressly provided by the constitution, should not exceed the\n\ntraditional judicial power by intruding on the powers of the executive and legislative\n\nbranches.\n\n\n       36\n          The majority argues that, in federal courts and the dozens of states who use the\nLujan framework, those entities’ respective constitutions cause serious detriment to the\npublic interest. This alarmist reasoning provides no support for overruling Lee. Indeed,\nthis whole argument underscores the manipulative nature of the majority’s stare decisis\ntest, which here is used to displace a widely accepted and commonly used national\nstandard. More disruptive to the public interest is the state of law to which the majority\nreturns Michigan today: no defined standards, thus allowing litigious individuals to bring\nunfounded lawsuits against fellow citizens.\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\f            C. MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE IN TURMOIL:\n THE MAJORITY’S INCREASING WILLINGNESS TO OVERRULE PRECEDENT\n                    WITH WHICH IT DISAGREES\n\n       Thus the majority continues to exhibit its absolute disregard for precedent\n\ninconvenient to its aims without regard to the consequences. As Justice MARKMAN\n\nemphasized in his dissent to the majority opinion in McCormick, ___ Mich at ___:\n\n              Even a cursory analysis of the majority’s treatment of precedent\n       since it ascended to power in January 2009 reveals a lack of sufficient\n       regard for recent precedents that is directly contrary to their own previous\n       assertions of the need not to needlessly overrule cases on account of stare\n       decisis. Past complaints on their part that cases should not be overruled\n       when the only thing that has changed is the membership of the Court have\n       gone by the wayside.\n\n“[A]ll the justices who comprise the majority . . . should more clearly recognize the\n\nconsequences of what they are doing.”          Id. at ___ (emphasis omitted).       Indeed, in\n\noverruling numerous significant cases of this Court—the growing list of which is\n\ncatalogued in McCormick by Justice MARKMAN, id. at ___—in the brief period since the\n\ncurrent majority came to power in January 2009, I find the majority’s feigned adherence\n\nto the doctrine of stare decisis here hard to swallow. Nothing about the majority’s\n\ndecision today “‘promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of\n\nlegal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decision, [or] contributes to the actual and\n\nperceived integrity of the judicial process.’” See ante at ___, quoting Payne v Tennessee,\n\n501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). Rather, the majority throws\n\ninto turmoil a well-accepted and constitutionally sound standing doctrine applicable to\n\nevery civil suit filed in this state that this Court adopted to rectify the total uncertainty in\n\nthis area that was evident in cases such as Detroit Fire Fighters, 449 Mich 629.\n\n\n                                              62\n\fAccordingly, I am nonplussed by Justice CAVANAGH’s ironic lip service to Alexander\n\nHamilton’s warning that, “to ‘“avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is\n\nindispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which\n\nserve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before\n\nthem . . . .”’” Ante at ___, quoting Petersen, 484 Mich at 314-315 (opinion by KELLY,\n\nJ.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed,\n\n1961).\n\n         Finally, as Justice MARKMAN has also illustrated, this case presents yet another\n\ntroubling element of the majority’s current unbounded disregard for precedent. Here as\n\nin several other recent cases, see McCormick, ___ Mich at ___, instead of accepting the\n\nissues as framed and argued by the parties throughout the case, the majority instead\n\ndirected the parties to brief whether a decision by the former majority should be\n\noverruled. Yet, as noted, the parties to this case have always argued that Lee governs\n\ntheir dispute.   Even plaintiffs—for whom the majority renders a favorable decision\n\nhere—never challenged the correctness and applicability of Lee to their case. Further,\n\nalthough other groups and members of the public have participated in this case by filing\n\nbriefs amicus curiae at the majority’s invitation, not a single brief supports plaintiffs’\n\nargument that they have standing here.37\n\n\n         37\n           Indeed, of the amici who responded to the majority’s request to file briefs\nanalyzing the correctness of Lee, only one questioned Lee and the cases following it: the\nNational Wildlife Federation (NWF), which was the successful plaintiff in Nat’l Wildlife,\n471 Mich 608, which applied Lee. Most notably, even the NWF does not argue that\nplaintiffs have standing here. Rather, the NWF stresses its belief that if the Legislature\n\n\n                                            63\n\f                   IV. FURTHER RESPONSE TO THE MAJORITY\n\n       Rather than ash, the majority’s stare decisis analysis should taste like bile in their\n\nmouths: like a bulimic after a three day bender, the majority justices now purge a\n\ndecade’s worth of vigorous protestations that they are committed to the principle of stare\n\ndecisis. As Justice YOUNG demonstrates at length in Univ of Mich Regents, ___ Mich at\n\n___ (YOUNG, J., dissenting), members of the majority stridently defended stare decisis for\n\nmany years when past cases supported their dissenting positions. Then-Justice KELLY\n\nsummed up their position in Pohutski v City of Allen Park, 465 Mich 675, 712; 641\n\nNW2d 219 (2002) (KELLY, J., dissenting), stating: “[I]f each successive Court, believing\n\nits reading is correct and past readings wrong, rejects precedent, then the law will\n\nfluctuate from year to year, rendering our jurisprudence dangerously unstable.” Yet here\n\nthey overrule Lee, most notably without ever addressing their former adherence to the\n\nLee/Lujan test.\n\n       As the Court established in Lee and as I recount here, Lee was built on this Court’s\n\nhistorical concepts of standing. By reversing the line of post-Lee cases here, the majority\n\nclaims that it “brings this Court back to the status quo ante.” Unfortunately, the pre-Lee\n\nstatus quo resulting from House Speaker, 443 Mich 560, was confusion and bitter\n\ndivision regarding rules that provided no clear guidance regarding Michigan’s\n\n\n\n\nexpressly grants a plaintiff standing in a statute, the courts should permit the suit without\nregard to whether the plaintiff also qualifies for standing under the Lee/Lujan test.\n\n\n\n                                             64\n\fconstitutional standing requirements.38 It is this state to which the majority returns\n\nMichigan law. Lee did not sacrifice Michigan standing jurisprudence, as the majority\n\npersists in repeating, nor did Lee conclude that federal standing jurisprudence was\n\nexpressly binding in Michigan. Rather, Lee favored the commonly-accepted federal test\n\nwhich brought consistency to Michigan courts in light of our lack of a clearly articulated,\n\nworkable test. Further, as members of the majority have recognized, there simply is no\n\nconstitutional “conflict” that would prevent Michigan’s continued use of the Lujan/Lee\n\ntest for standing.39 These truths—as well as the overall reasonableness of the Lee test—\n\nare evident in the near-unanimous acceptance of the test in Lee itself. How is it possible\n\nthat the majority now rejects the very test suggested by Justice CAVANAGH himself in\n\nDetroit Fire Fighters, accusing the Lee Court of adopting a test that “casually displaced\n\ndecades of inconsistent precedent,” “is likely to result in serious detriment to the public\n\ninterest,” and is “contrary” to Michigan law? As Justice YOUNG has observed in a\n\n\n\n\n      38\n          The majority persists in suggesting that Michigan had a clear, workable standing\ndoctrine for “decades” before Lee was decided. To the contrary, our 1993 decision in\nHouse Speaker, where the Court was apparently unable to make sense of Michigan’s\nhistorical approach to standing, left our standing doctrine muddled and impossible to\napply with any consistency.\n      39\n           The majority’s unexplained suggestion that, in Michigan, “controversy” means\nsomething different than throughout the rest of the nation is without basis. As I explain\nabove, the federal “case or controversy” requirement limits only the range of\ncontroversies that may be heard in federal courts, and this is distinct from the\nrequirement—common to federal and state law alike—that an actual case or controversy\nexists in the first place.\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\fsimilar context,40 United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have best\n\ndescribed our concerns about the majority’s recent about-face with regard to stare decisis\n\nas well as its new approach to standing with the following observation:\n\n              Evidently, the governing standard is to be what might be called the\n       unfettered wisdom of a majority of this Court, revealed to an obedient\n       people on a case-by-case basis. This is not only not the government of laws\n       that the Constitution established; it is not a government of laws at all.\n       [Morrison v Olson, 487 US 654, 712; 108 S Ct 2597; 101 L Ed 2d 569\n       (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).]\n\n       Finally, although the majority criticizes me for actually addressing the questions\n\npresented in this case, my analysis is necessary precisely because the majority applies an\n\nunworkable, amorphous approach to standing.          The lower courts had little trouble\n\nagreeing, in relatively brief decisions, that plaintiffs do not have standing under the\n\nprinciples enunciated in Lee. But the majority’s approach so obscures the reasons courts\n\nimpose standing requirements in the first place that it leaves the dissent in a position akin\n\nto one who must “prove a negative”; thus, I attempt to show why the lower courts’\n\nconclusions that plaintiffs clearly could not proceed are indisputably correct under the\n\nterms of the statute invoked by plaintiffs to establish standing. Indeed, in light of the\n\nexpress terms of the school code, its enforcement procedures, and its disciplinary\n\nprovisions, I am baffled by the majority’s conclusion, under its own new discretionary\n\napproach, that the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that plaintiffs could not\n\nproceed here.       How is the majority’s new non-test for standing anything but a\n\n\n       40\n            Univ of Mich Regents, ___ Mich at ___ (YOUNG, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                             66\n\fproclamation that it will decide, on the basis of personal policy considerations, whether a\n\nplaintiff may maintain a suit against a particular defendant?\n\n       The majority essentially concludes that plaintiffs have standing because their\n\nsafety might have been one aim of MCL 380.1311a(1) without any regard to the\n\nLegislature’s actual intent or to the ramifications of this suit. For example, although no\n\none in this suit represents students’ rights—and thus no one may consider their rights as\n\nthe suit proceeds or in an eventual settlement—the majority presumes that the right result\n\nwill simply come out in the wash after the complaint is authorized on standing grounds.\n\nIndeed, under the majority’s approach, what prevents anyone with a proclaimed\n\n“substantial interest” from suing a defendant such as the school board here in an attempt\n\nto trample on the rights of an unrepresented third party?41 Because a plaintiff no longer\n\n\n       41\n          May I sue a landlord under a local noise ordinance for failing to evict my noisy\nneighbor without notice to my neighbor? May I sue the police department for failing to\nticket the teenagers loitering outside my favorite window seat at a local restaurant? In\neach case, I might allege that the defendant had a duty to enforce a particular law and that\nI had a “substantial interest” in its enforcement under the facts presented. Further, in\neach case, the named defendant may be perfectly willing to comply with my demands\nand happy to do so without arguing, as defendants do here, that the case should not\nproceed because I have no right to govern his relationship with the third party or affect\nthe absent third party’s rights. This Court expressed similar concerns regarding the view\nof the judicial power offered by the dissent in Nat’l Wildlife Fed—which the majority\ntoday overrules—when discussing environmental suits brought under MCL 324.1701(1)\nof the Michigan environmental protection act:\n\n              Under th[e former dissenting] view of the “judicial power,” “any\n       person,” for example, could seek to enjoin “any person” from mowing his\n       lawn with a gas-powered mower because such activity allegedly creates air\n       pollution and uses fossil fuels when other alternatives are available. “Any\n       person” could sue “any person” for using too much fertilizer on his\n       property, or allowing too much runoff from a feedlot on his property.\n\n\n                                            67\n\fneeds to show a concrete and particularized injury, or that the court actually has the\n\npower to grant relief to me from that defendant, or that the legislative body intended to\n\ncreate a cause of action, presumably any such plaintiff can proceed. Particularly by\n\npermitting plaintiffs to sue to enforce a governmental agency’s statutory duties with no\n\nattention to whether the Legislature intended to create a cause of action, the majority\n\nutterly ignores separation of powers principles including the Legislature’s sole purview to\n\nlegislate such duties and to define the proper mechanisms for their enforcement.42\n\n       Consistent with the majority’s deconstruction of Michigan’s guiding legal\n\nprinciples over the last two years, the result boils down to this: in this state, anyone has\n\n       “Any person” could sue “any person” from using excessive amounts of\n       pesticides in his home or garden or farm. “Any person” could sue “any\n       person” for improperly disposing of used petroleum-based oils. “Any\n       person” could sue “any person” for improper backyard grilling practices,\n       excessive use of aerosol sprays and propellants, or wasteful lawn watering.\n       [471 Mich at 649-650.]\n\nAt least the scenarios presented in Nat’l Wildlife involved suits against the allegedly\noffending party; here, the majority permits plaintiffs to maintain suit despite the absence\nof the students they seek to punish.\n       42\n          Members of the executive branch are thus vulnerable to suits filed by any person\nclaiming a substantial interest in their affairs. I note the following timely illustration of\nwhat may arise. In the midst of the City of Detroit’s ongoing financial woes and the\nongoing crisis its public school system, an activist group joined teachers and school board\nmembers to sue Robert Bobb, the emergency financial manager of the Detroit Public\nSchools, seeking to challenge the salary terms of his contract with the governor and the\nstate superintendent of schools. A circuit court judge dismissed the suit, concluding that\nthe plaintiffs did not have legal standing. Marisa Schultz, Judge throws out lawsuit over\nFinancial Manager Bobb’s pay, The Detroit News, July 29, 2010, available at\n<http://www.detnews.com/article/20100729/SCHOOLS/7290468/1409/Judge-throws-out\n-lawsuit-over-DPS-Financial-Manager-Bobb-s-pay> (accessed July 30, 2010). Under the\nmajority’s new approach, their suit seems tenable because all they have to allege is an ill-\ndefined “substantial interest” in the management of local schools.\n\n\n\n                                             68\n\fstanding to sue anyone else, any time. As in McCormick, ___ Mich ___, for example,\n\nwhere the majority significantly lowered the threshold for suits against Michigan drivers\n\nunder our automobile no-fault insurance scheme,43 the majority continues to encourage\n\nlitigation at a high cost to individuals, the courts, local governments and local officials.\n\nThis complete destabilization of established law benefits no one.\n\n                                    V. CONCLUSION\n\n         For each of these reasons, I dissent. I would affirm the decision of the Court of\n\nAppeals, which reached the correct result and properly applied the law of this state. The\n\nmajority’s conclusion that plaintiffs have standing here is devoid of any analysis and\n\nincorrect under any meaningful test.      Its decision to grant standing here under an\n\namorphous new test of its own making is unprincipled and opportunistic; in its haste to\n\noverrule yet another precedent of this Court, it grants teachers the right to sue for\n\nexpulsion of children from our public schools without any regard for the students’ rights.\n\nFinally, its choice to eschew the well-established Lee test aggregates limitless power in\n\nthe courts, is contrary to our constitution, and will only damage the rule of law in our\n\nstate.\n\n         YOUNG and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with CORRIGAN, J.\n\n\n         43\n          See McCormick, ___ Mich at ___ (MARKMAN, J., dissenting) (“By nullifying the\nlegislative compromise that was struck when the no-fault act was adopted—a\ncompromise grounded in concerns over excessive litigation, the over-compensation of\nminor injuries, and the availability of affordable insurance—the Court’s decision today\nwill restore a legal environment in which each of these hazards reappear and threaten the\ncontinued fiscal soundness of our no-fault system.”).\n\n\n\n                                            69\n\f",

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Plaintiffs are the Lansing School Education Association (LSEA), the Michigan\n\nand National Education Associations (MEA/NEA), and four teachers who are employed\n\nby defendants, the Lansing School District and the Lansing Board of Education. Each of\n\nthe four teachers alleges that they were physically assaulted in the classroom by a student\n\nwho was in grade six or higher, and each of the incidents was reported to a school\n\nadministrator.1   The students were suspended but not expelled.        Plaintiff Filonczuk\n\nalleges that the assaultive student was returned to her building, but not to her classroom,\n\nand none of the other teachers allege that the student was returned to the same classroom\n\nor school.\n\n       1\n         Cathy Stachwick alleges that a seventh grader threw a leather wristband with\nmetal spikes towards her back, and the wristband bounced off the blackboard and struck\nher in the head. Penny Filonczuk and Ellen Wheeler allege that students in sixth grade or\nhigher intentionally threw chairs at them. Elizabeth Namie alleges that a student in grade\nsix or higher intentionally slapped her back.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f       Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that defendants failed to comply with their mandatory\n\nduty under MCL 380.1311a(1) to expel students who physically assault a teacher.2 They\n\nsought a writ of mandamus and declaratory and injunctive relief. In support of the\n\naction, three of the teachers filed affidavits stating that they believe that failing to expel\n\nstudents who physically assault a teacher increases the likelihood of other assaults and\n\nthreatens the safety of the school environment. Plaintiff Filonczuk further stated that she\n\nfelt discomfort due to the student’s return to her building, and the other two teachers\n\nstated that they would have felt unsafe if the students who assaulted them had returned to\n\ntheir buildings.\n\n       Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that plaintiffs lack standing,\n\nthe statute does not create a private cause of action, and plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter\n\nof law because the school district did not abuse its discretionary authority in determining\n\nthat none of the students had committed an “assault.” The trial court granted the motion,\n\nreasoning that the court lacked authority to supervise the school district’s exercise of its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s grant of\n\nsummary disposition on different grounds. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2057162\"><a href=\"/opinion/2057162/lansing-ed-assn-v-lansing-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

ANALYSIS\n\n       The issue in this case is whether the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority erred in\n\nadopting a standing doctrine that departed dramatically from Michigan’s historical\n\napproach to standing. We hold that they did and that Michigan’s standing doctrine\n\nshould be restored to an approach that is consistent with the limited, prudential approach\n\nused historically. Under this approach, plaintiffs do not lack standing.\n\n                       A. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT\n                      OF MICHIGAN’S STANDING DOCTRINE\n\n       The purpose of the standing doctrine is to assess whether a litigant’s interest in the\n\nissue is sufficient to “ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy.” Detroit Fire Fighters\n\nAss’n v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1281120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1281120/detroit-fire-fighters-assn-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633; 537 NW2d 436 (1995). Thus, the standing inquiry\n\nfocuses on whether a litigant “is a proper party to request adjudication of a particular\n\nissue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable.” Allstate Ins Co v Hayes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2068267\"><a href=\"/opinion/2068267/allstate-ins-co-v-hayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68; 499 NW2d 743 (1993) (quotation marks and citations omitted). This doctrine has\n\ndeep roots in Michigan law, and, although it has been used with increasing frequency in\n\nmodern jurisprudence, before Lee it remained a limited, prudential doctrine.\n\n       Historically, the standing doctrine grew out of cases where parties were seeking\n\nwrits of mandamus to compel a public officer to perform a statutory duty. See, e.g.,\n\nPeople ex rel Ayres v Bd of State Auditors, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429-430; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1880);\n\nPeople ex rel Drake v University of Mich Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101-102 (1856). Standing\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fwas a prudential limit, which is to say that the court’s decision to invoke it was “one of\n\ndiscretion and not of law.” Ayres, 42 Mich at 429.

Drake, 4 Mich at 101-102. Generally, the court\n\nexercised its discretion to hear a case if the citizen had “some individual interest in the\n\nsubject matter of [the] complaint which is not common to all the citizens of the\n\nstate . . . .” Id. at 103.

See, also, Gilleland, 191 Mich at 278, listing remedies to which the rule\n\nhad been extended. Notably, these cases only discussed the doctrine when no cause of\n\naction was clearly provided under law and the Court was deciding whether, within its\n\ndiscretion, to allow the party to bring the claim despite the lack of an express cause of\n\naction. Further, the standing inquiry was distinct from the merits of the case. Thus,\n\n\n                                             5\n\falthough the Court sometimes reached the merits of a case despite concluding that a party\n\nlacked standing, the Court did not find it necessary to determine whether a party’s claim\n\nhad merit in order to determine whether a party had standing.\n\n       References to standing became more frequent in Michigan’s modern\n\njurisprudence, and the doctrine was developed more extensively but remained a\n\nprudential limit that could, within the Court’s discretion, be ignored.3 Further, the fact\n\nthat there was a cause of action under law, or the Legislature expressly conferred\n\nstanding, was sufficient to establish standing.4 Where a party was seeking declaratory\n\nrelief, the Court repeatedly held that meeting the requirements of the court rule governing\n\ndeclaratory actions was sufficient to establish standing.

But where a cause\n\nof action was not provided at law, the Court, in its discretion, would consider whether a\n\nlitigant had standing based on a special injury or right or substantial interest that would\n\nbe detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large, or because, in\n\nthe context of a statutory scheme, the Legislature had intended to confer standing on the\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Although the Court splintered on how to articulate when standing could be\nimplied from a statutory scheme that does not expressly grant standing in the last major\npre-Lee case addressing this issue, Detroit Fire Fighters Ass’n, Justice WEAVER’s lead\nopinion articulated general principles consistent with the historical approach. 449 Mich\nat 633. Further, Justice MALLETT’s statement that the key issue is “whether the plaintiff\ncan demonstrate any special right, injury, or zone of interest that deserves the protections\nof the law,” is consistent with the historical doctrine. 449 Mich at 663 (MALLETT, J.,\nconcurring in the result only). Justice RILEY’s concurrence, however, erred in conflating\nthe distinct inquiries of whether a plaintiff has standing under a statutory scheme and\nwhether there is an implied statutory cause of action. 449 Mich at 644-645.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\flitigant. It was not necessary to address the merits of the case in order to address\n\nstanding.\n\n             B. THE LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS STANDING DOCTRINE\n\n      Despite the consistency of the historical development of the standing doctrine in\n\nMichigan, Lee and its progeny abruptly departed from precedent and radically changed\n\nthe standing doctrine. This doctrine’s flaws are many.\n\n                 1. OVERVIEW OF THE LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS\n                     MAJORITY’S APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n      In Lee, a majority of the Court determined, for the first time in Michigan\n\njurisprudence, that standing was required by the Michigan Constitution, and, further, that\n\nMichigan’s standing doctrine should be abandoned in favor of the standing doctrine\n\nadopted by the United States Supreme Court in the context of the federal constitution.\n\nThe reasoning presented in Lee, and expanded in Cleveland Cliffs, is that standing is\n\nessential to Michigan’s separation of powers doctrine. See Lee, 464 Mich at 735. The\n\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs majority explained that Article III, § 1 of the federal constitution\n\ngrants federal courts only the “judicial power” and Article III, § 2 limits the judicial\n\npower to certain “Cases” or “Controversies.” Lee, 464 Mich at 735. Although the\n\nMichigan Constitution does not include “Cases” or “Controversies” requirements, the\n\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs majority concluded that the Michigan Constitution is analogous to\n\nthe federal constitution because it expressly requires the separation of powers and grants\n\ncourts only the judicial power. Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at 615; Lee, 464 Mich at 737-\n\n738. The majority further determined that the cornerstone of the judicial power is the\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fcase-or-controversy requirement.

The Court also held that a litigant must meet Lujan’s requirements in\n\norder to bring a declaratory action. Associated Builders & Contractors v Dep’t of\n\n\n       6\n        Lee cited older Michigan caselaw to define the judicial power as “the power to\nhear and determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in litigation,”\nand “the authority to hear and decide controversies, and to make binding orders and\njudgments respecting them.” 464 Mich at 738, quoting Daniels v People, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n388 (1859), and Risser v Hoyt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1884) (emphasis omitted).\nThe Cleveland Cliffs majority, however, only cited federal caselaw in support of its\ncontention that “[p]erhaps the most critical element of the ‘judicial power’ has been its\nrequirement of a genuine case or controversy between the parties . . . .” Cleveland Cliffs,\n471 Mich at 615.\n       7\n           The test requires that the plaintiff show (1) an injury-in-fact, meaning the\n“invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b)\nactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; (2) causality, meaning that the\ninjury is “fairly trace[able]” to the challenged conduct; and (3) redressability, meaning\nthat it is “likely” that a favorable decision would “redress” the injury.

Thus,\n\nafter Lee and its progeny, little remained of the historical limited, prudential approach to\n\nstanding, and the doctrine was significantly expanded.\n\n           2. CRITICISMS OF THE LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS MAJORITY’S\n                          APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n       The flaws in the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs approach are many.8             Perhaps most\n\negregiously, however, the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority dramatically distorted Michigan\n\njurisprudence to invent out of whole cloth a constitutional basis for the standing doctrine\n\nand then, perplexingly, determined that Michigan’s standing doctrine should be\n\nessentially coterminous with the federal doctrine, despite the significant differences\n\nbetween the two constitutions and the powers held by the respective court systems.\n\nThere is no support in either the text of the Michigan Constitution or in Michigan\n\njurisprudence, however, for recognizing standing as a constitutional requirement or for\n\nadopting the federal standing doctrine.\n\n       To begin with, there is no textual basis in the Michigan Constitution for\n\nconcluding that standing is constitutionally required, and there are important differences\n\nbetween the two constitutions. The Michigan Constitution provides for the separation of\n\npowers between the legislative, judicial, and executive branches and vests the courts with\n\n\n       8\n         Only the fundamental legal error most relevant to the stare decisis analysis will\nbe reviewed because other criticisms have been thoroughly addressed in various opinions\nin this Court. For further discussion, however, see, e.g., Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at\n651-675, (WEAVER, J., concurring); Mich Citizens for Water Conservation, 479 Mich at\n310-322 (WEAVER, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\fthe judicial power. Const 1963, art 3, § 2; art 6, § 1. The federal constitution similarly\n\nvests the judicial power in the courts. US Const, art III, § 1. Unlike the Michigan\n\nConstitution, however, the federal constitution enumerates the cases and controversies to\n\nwhich the judicial power extends, and the federal standing doctrine is largely derived\n\nfrom this art III case-or-controversy requirement. See Lujan, 504 US at 560, stating that\n\n“the core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.” Additionally, strictly interpreting the judicial\n\npower of Michigan courts to be identical to the federal court’s judicial power does not\n\nreflect the broader power held by state courts. Whereas federal courts only have the\n\npowers enumerated in the United States Constitution, the states retain powers not ceded\n\nto the federal government. US Const, Am X. See also Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at\n\n683-684 (KELLY, J., concurring). As this Court has stated, in Michigan, “[w]hile the\n\nlegislature obtains legislative power and the courts receive judicial power by grant in the\n\nState Constitution, the whole of such power reposing in the sovereignty is granted to\n\nthose bodies except as it may be restricted in the same instrument.”9 Washington-Detroit\n\nTheatre Co v Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1930). Given that the text of the\n\nMichigan Constitution lacks an express basis for importing the federal case-or-\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          As noted in Justice WEAVER’s Cleveland Cliffs concurring opinion, and\ndiscussed in her concurrence in this case, adopting standing as a constitutional doctrine\npotentially may even violate the separation of powers doctrine under the Michigan\nConstitution. 471 Mich at 668-669.\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fcontroversy requirement into Michigan law, the justification for doing so, if one can be\n\nfound, must lie elsewhere.\n\n       The Cleveland Cliffs majority dismissed the lack of a textual case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement in the Michigan Constitution as irrelevant because it held that the case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement is a limitation inherent in the judicial power.10 However, even\n\nassuming arguendo that the judicial power implicitly extends only to cases or\n\ncontroversies, there is no basis for rejecting the understanding Michigan courts\n\ntraditionally had of this power to instead give it the same meaning it has in the very\n\ndifferent context of the federal constitution. This conclusion is certainly not required by\n\nfederal law, as the United States Supreme Court has “recognized often that the\n\nconstraints of Article III do not apply to state courts, and accordingly the state courts are\n\nnot bound by the limitations of a case or controversy or other federal rules of\n\njusticiability . . . .” ASARCO Inc v Kadish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112268\"><a href=\"/opinion/112268/asarco-inc-v-kadish/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112268\"><a href=\"/opinion/112268/asarco-inc-v-kadish/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But, of course, other state’s courts’ interpretations of\ntheir own constitutions are not binding or even necessarily instructive to our\ninterpretation of the Michigan Constitution. Furthermore, many states have either\ndeclined to adopt the Lujan standing test or do not apply it exclusively. See, e.g., Kellas\nv Dep’t of Corrections, 341 Or 471, 478; 145 P3d 139 (2006), noting that “[t]he Oregon\nConstitution contains no ‘cases’ or ‘controversies’ provision” and declining to “import\n\n\n                                             13\n\fago explained that Michigan courts’ judicial power to decide controversies was broader\n\nthan the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the art III case-or-controversy\n\nlimits on the federal judicial power because a state sovereign possesses inherent powers\n\nthat the federal government does not.

Even setting aside whether there is a truly logical distinction between the\ndissent’s criticisms of the use of legislative history to interpret a statute and its use of a\ndelegate’s preenactment impressions of constitutional text to interpret that text, these\nquotations provide no support that any delegate believed that standing was a\nconstitutional requirement. They merely demonstrate that certain delegates believed that\nthe judicial power extended to cases and controversies, which, at that time, had never\nbeen interpreted to incorporate standing as a constitutional requirement in Michigan.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       Most importantly, however, not only does the federal standing jurisprudence have\n\nno basis in Michigan law, it is contrary to it. As explained above, before Lee, the\n\nstanding doctrine was not treated as a constitutional requirement in Michigan\n\njurisprudence; that is, the Court never concluded that a lack of standing equated to the\n\nlack of a controversy necessary for the invocation of the judicial power under the\n\nMichigan Constitution. As discussed, before Lee, from the doctrine’s inception this\n\nCourt has at times addressed a case’s merits despite concluding that the parties lacked\n\nstanding. And, more generally, before Lee, “controversy” was never interpreted, as it is\n\nunder Lujan, to refer only to instances where the party suffered a concrete and\n\nparticularized injury caused directly by the challenged conduct. Thus, the Michigan\n\nConstitution does not compel adoption of the federal standing doctrine, and there is no\n\nsupport for doing so in this Court’s historical jurisprudence.\n\n       Indeed, the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs majority, and the dissent in this case, make\n\nunsupported logical, or, rather, illogical, leaps.       They expend significant energy\n\nexplaining that Michigan law has historically required a case or a controversy to invoke\n\nthe judicial power. See, e.g., Cleveland Cliffs, 471 Mich at 626-628. Then, citing only\n\ncases that stand for that limited proposition, and without distinguishing or overruling the\n\nvolume of precedent discussed in this opinion, they conclude that simply because this\n\nCourt has stated that the judicial power extends to cases and controversies, standing is\n\ntherefore required by the Michigan Constitution and must be equivalent to the federal\n\nstanding doctrine adopted in Lujan.       Id. at 628-629.    They utterly fail to explain,\n\nhowever, why decades of Michigan standing jurisprudence must be sacrificed on the altar\n\n\n                                             15\n\fof the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the federal case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement, despite the lack of support in Michigan caselaw for understanding a\n\n“controversy” to exist only in the same, limited circumstances explained in Lujan and\n\ndespite the conflict with Michigan’s historic approach to standing.\n\n                                   C. STARE DECISIS\n\n       In light of the fact that the Michigan Constitution’s reference to the judicial power\n\ndoes not inherently incorporate the federal case-or-controversy requirement, and, in fact,\n\nimporting this requirement is inconsistent with this Court’s historical view of its own\n\npowers and the scope of the standing doctrine, the question arises as to whether this\n\nCourt should continue to apply the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs doctrine.

The importance of the stare decisis doctrine is well-established, for, as\n\nAlexander Hamilton stated, to “‘avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is\n\nindispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which\n\nserve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before\n\nthem . . . .’” Petersen v Magna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314-315; 773 NW2d 564 (2009)\n\n(opinion by KELLY, C.J.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander Hamilton)\n\n(Clinton Rossiter ed, 1961).

Thus, by\n\nreinstating the decades-old precedent from which Lee departed, we are restoring, not\n\ndeparting from, the fabric of the law and this Court’s fidelity to the Michigan\n\nConstitution.15\n\n       Further, regardless of the level of deference due Lee and Cleveland Cliffs, there is\n\na compelling justification to overrule the standing doctrine adopted in those cases. I find\n\nseveral evaluative criteria to be relevant, including: (1) “whether the rule has proven to\n\nbe intolerable because it defies practical workability”; (2) “whether reliance on the rule is\n\nsuch that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity”; (3) “whether\n\nupholding the rule is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests”;\n\nand (4) “whether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from\n\nprecedent.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 320. 16\n\n\n\n\n       15\n           Contrary to the mewling of the dissenters, who would enshrine their\ndisembowelment of 10 to 50 years of this Court’s jurisprudence, in Lee and many other\ncases, this majority’s reversal of their recent activist efforts simply brings this Court back\nto the status quo ante. Indeed, the dissenters’ stare decisis protestations should taste like\nashes in their mouths. Although the dissenters paid absolutely no heed to stare decisis as\nthey denigrated the wisdom of innumerable predecessors, the dissenters would now wrap\nthemselves in its benefits to save their recent precedent.\n       16\n          The other criteria suggested by Chief Justice KELLY in Petersen are not\napplicable to this case or are neutral. For example, perhaps because the case was recently\ndecided, there are no related principles of law that have eroded the rule and there are no\nsignificant changed facts or circumstances. Further, as noted, the jurisprudence from\nother states and jurisdictions has limited value because it is based on distinct\njurisprudential history and constitutions, and, regardless, there are states that have\nfollowed Lujan and there are states that have rejected it.\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f       The first criterion weighs slightly in favor of affirming the Lee/Cleveland Cliffs\n\nstanding doctrine because, although confusion sometimes arises over the application of\n\nthe factors, the test does not rise to the level of defying practical workability.\n\n       The second criterion, the strength of reliance on the rule, weighs in favor of\n\noverruling Lee and Cleveland Cliffs because it seems unlikely that potential future\n\ndefendants, including the government, have been violating laws on the basis of the\n\nassumption it could not be challenged because no party would have standing under Lee to\n\ndo so. To the extent that such interests exist, they are not the type of reliance interests\n\nthat this Court seeks to protect.\n\n       The third criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling Lee because the doctrine\n\nis likely to result in serious detriment to the public interest. The purpose of the standing\n\ndoctrine in Michigan has always been to “ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy.” But\n\nthe Lee/Cleveland Cliffs standing doctrine is, at the expense of the public interest,\n\nbroader than this purpose because it may prevent litigants from enforcing public rights,\n\ndespite the presence of adverse interests and parties, and regardless of whether the\n\nLegislature intended a private right of enforcement to be part of the statute’s enforcement\n\nscheme.     As noted by Chief Justice KELLY’s Cleveland Cliffs concurrence, the\n\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs standing doctrine “creates a self-inflicted wound” that prevents the\n\nCourt from serving justice and protecting the public interest. 471 Mich at 689. Further,\n\nas many commentators have noted, the federal standing doctrine has the effect of\n\nencouraging courts to decide the merits of a case under the guise of merely deciding that\n\nthe plaintiff lacks standing, thus using “standing to slam the courthouse door against\n\n\n                                              20\n\fplaintiffs who are entitled to full consideration of their claims on the merits.” Valley\n\nForge Christian College v Americans United for Separation of Church & State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROPER APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n       The question then becomes what standing doctrine this Court should adopt in lieu\n\nof Lee/Cleveland Cliffs.     We hold that Michigan standing jurisprudence should be\n\nrestored to a limited, prudential doctrine that is consistent with Michigan’s long-standing\n\nhistorical approach to standing.19 Under this approach, a litigant has standing whenever\n\nthere is a legal cause of action. Further, whenever a litigant meets the requirements of\n\nMCR 2.605, it is sufficient to establish standing to seek a declaratory judgment.20 Where\n\na cause of action is not provided at law, then a court should, in its discretion, determine\n\nwhether a litigant has standing. A litigant may have standing in this context if the litigant\n\nhas a special injury or right, or substantial interest, that will be detrimentally affected in a\n\nmanner different from the citizenry at large or if the statutory scheme implies that the\n\nLegislature intended to confer standing on the litigant.\n\n\n\nMich at 126-127, is overruled to the extent that it required a litigant to establish the\nLee/Cleveland Cliffs standing requirements in order to bring an action under MCR 2.605.\n       19\n         The dissent’s Chicken Little-esque wails of the impending stampede to the\ncourthouse that will result from today’s decision ignore that we do nothing more than\nrestore an approach to standing that is consistent with the approach that this Court\nfollowed for decades without courts being overburdened with a flood of litigation before\nLee was decided a mere nine years ago.\n       20\n          The pre-Lee/Cleveland Cliffs standard, which was also incorporated into\nAssociated Builders & Contractors, remains: “[t]he essential requirement of the term\n‘actual controversy’ under the rule is that plaintiffs ‘plead and prove facts which indicate\nan adverse interest necessitating the sharpening of the issues raised.’” Associated\nBuilders & Contractors, 472 Mich at 126, quoting Shavers, 402 Mich at 589.\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\f            2. APPLICATION OF THE STANDING DOCTRINE TO THIS CASE\n\n       The next question is whether, in this case, plaintiffs have standing. Plaintiffs seek\n\na declaratory judgment, a writ of mandamus, and injunctive relief.21 We hold that\n\nplaintiffs have standing to pursue at least some of their claims.\n\n       To begin with, under the proper approach to standing, plaintiffs may seek a\n\ndeclaratory judgment if the requirements in MCR 2.605 are met. We remand to the\n\nCourt of Appeals to decide whether plaintiffs meet the requirements of MCR 2.605\n\nbecause it did not previously address this issue.\n\n       Further, we must decide whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue the rest of their\n\nclaims because the Revised School Code, MCL 380.1 et seq., does not create an express\n\ncause of action or expressly confer standing on plaintiffs to enforce the act’s provisions.22\n\nWe hold that, in this case, plaintiffs have standing because they have a substantial\n\n\n\n\n       21\n          It is not disputed that, under Michigan law, an organization has standing to\nadvocate for the interests of its members if the members themselves have a sufficient\ninterest. See, e.g., Trout Unlimited, Muskegon-White River Chapter v White Cloud, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1348789\"><a href=\"/opinion/1348789/trout-unlimited-v-city-of-white-cloud/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348; 489 NW2d 188 (1992). Thus, because we hold that the plaintiff-\nteachers have standing, and it is not disputed that the plaintiff-teachers are members of\nthe plaintiff-organizations, the plaintiff-organizations have standing as well.\n       22\n          In dicta, the Court of Appeals decision in this case suggested that there is no\nimplied private cause of action to enforce the Revised School Code. We do not reach the\nmerits of that issue, however, because plaintiffs are not seeking a private cause of action\nfor damages. See, generally, Lash v Traverse City, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196-197; 735 NW2d\n628 (2007), explaining that a party may seek remedies other than monetary damages,\nsuch as declaratory relief under MCR 2.605(A)(1), against a governmental unit without\nhaving to demonstrate that a statute has an implied private right of action.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\finterest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1) that will be detrimentally affected in a\n\nmanner different from the citizenry at large if the statute is not enforced.\n\n       To begin with, the text of MCL 380.1311a itself suggests that plaintiffs have a\n\nsubstantial and distinct interest. It requires that a qualifying student be expelled for\n\nphysically assaulting an employee of the school, which is defined to include the plaintiff-\n\nteachers. Given that the students are expelled for assaulting employees of the school, and\n\nnot the citizenry at large, it is apparent from the statute that the plaintiff-teachers have a\n\nsubstantial interest in the enforcement of this provision distinct from the general public.\n\nThe members of the general public might never be in a school, and, even for those who\n\nare, an assault on those members would not necessarily lead to the expulsion of the\n\nassaultive student.\n\n       Moreover, the legislative history to the 1999 legislative amendments that adopted\n\nMCL 380.1311a(1) into the Revised School Code make clear that the purpose of the\n\nsection is to create a safer school environment and, even more specifically, a safer and\n\nmore effective working environment for teachers.23 The enrolled analysis of the public\n\n\n       23\n          The dissent suggests that the same limitations that apply to using legislative\nhistory to interpret a statute should be applied to determining whether a party has a\nsubstantial and distinct interest in the statute’s enforcement that is sufficient to establish\nstanding. We disagree. If the Legislature unambiguously expresses an intent to confer\nstanding through a statute’s text, then it would certainly be sufficient to confer standing.\nBut the inquiry into whether a party has a substantial and distinct interest in the\nenforcement of the statute is a much broader inquiry for which legislative history may be\ninstructive. Indeed, before Lee, this Court would sometimes consider legislative history\nin determining whether a party had standing. See, e.g., Frame v Nehls, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1711281\"><a href=\"/opinion/1711281/frame-v-nehls/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n176-180; 550 NW2d 739 (1996); Girard, 437 Mich at 244-247. Further, while analyzing\nlegislative intent is essential if a party is attempting to demonstrate that the Legislature\n\n\n                                             24\n\fact adopting the amendments explained that the rationale for their enactment is that “[i]n\n\nMichigan, school safety is an ongoing concern,” and, although an earlier public act\n\n“addresses several aspects of school violence, additional concerns remain,” and “[i]n\n\nparticular, it has been suggested that students should be expelled or suspended when they\n\nphysically or verbally assault teachers or other school personnel . . . .” Enrolled Senate\n\nFiscal Agency Analysis of SB 183, SB 206, HB 4240, and HB 4241, July 21, 1999. The\n\nanalysis explains that the arguments in favor of the act included that “additional measures\n\nare necessary to create and maintain a safe educational environment” because “[t]eachers\n\nwho are subject to student assaults cannot effectively teach, and pupils who feel\n\nendangered cannot learn.” (Emphasis added.) It further explained that “[s]ince just one\n\nmiscreant can disrupt an entire classroom, and a handful can ruin the atmosphere of a\n\nschool, removing these individuals will promote efforts to educate and to learn, as well as\n\nprotect the physical safety of school personnel and students” and concluded by\n\nexplaining that “[a] comprehensive State approach toward student violence should deter\n\nfuture assaults and other disciplinary problems.” (Emphasis added.) In other words, the\n\nlegislative history of the act indicates that the intended purposes of MCL 380.1311a(1)\n\nare exactly what common sense would suggest based on the statutory text: to make the\n\nschool and classroom environment safer in general and specifically to protect teachers’\n\n\nintended to confer standing or create a private right that the party would have standing to\nenforce, this Court has not historically found an analysis of legislative intent necessary\nfor a party to demonstrate that the party has a substantial interest in the enforcement of a\nstatute relating to a public right that is distinct from that of the general public. See, e.g.,\nHouse Speaker v State Admin Bd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2174406\"><a href=\"/opinion/2174406/speaker-v-state-administrative-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 495 NW2d 539 (1993).\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\fphysical safety and their ability to effectively teach by removing miscreants and assisting\n\nin deterring future assaults. The plaintiffs-teachers’ affidavits indicate that, consistent\n\nwith these purposes, the alleged failure of the school board to comply with the statute\n\nincreases the threat to their safety.\n\n       In light of these purposes, and the plaintiffs-teachers’ affidavits, it is even more\n\nclear that teachers have a substantial interest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1)\n\nthat is distinct from that of the general public.        The legislative history specifically\n\ncontemplates that the statute is intended to not only make the general school environment\n\nsafer but additionally to specifically protect teachers from assault and to assist them in\n\nmore effectively performing their jobs. These are hardly interests that are shared by the\n\ngeneral public. 24 Thus, teachers who work in a public school have a significant interest\n\ndistinct from that of the general public in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n       24\n           Indeed, because of this, plaintiffs’ claim to having a more substantial interest\nthan that of the general public is greater than that of the firefighter-plaintiffs in Detroit\nFire Fighters Ass’n. In that case, Justice WEAVER’s lead opinion explained, that, in her\nview, firefighters did not have a substantial interest in the effects of reduced funding for\nthe fire department that was sufficiently distinct from that of the general public because,\nalthough firefighters were subject to a greater risk of harm if the number of total\nfirefighters was reduced, members of the public who were trapped in burning houses\nwere also subject to a greater likelihood of injury, and, thus, “[b]oth segments of society\nare at greater risk when there is a dearth of fire fighters.” 449 Mich at 638 (quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Other justices, including myself, would have concluded that\nthe firefighters did have a sufficiently distinct interest to establish standing. But,\nregardless, it is apparent that plaintiffs’ interest in this case is even more distinct than that\nof the firefighters. As noted by the dissent, a teacher is more likely to be at a school, just\nas a firefighter is more likely to be at a fire. But whereas all members of the public are at\nrisk of being in a building that may catch fire, all members of the public are not\nnecessarily in schools so that they are at risk of being assaulted in a classroom or, even if\nthey are in a school, of being affected by a less effective teaching environment.\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f       We agree that, as stated by the dissent, the issue in this case is whether “a teacher\n\n[can] sue a school board for its failure to expel a student who allegedly assaulted that\n\nteacher.” Post at ___. In its many erroneous blanket statements about what we are\n\nholding today, the dissent seems to assume that we have answered that question with a\n\ndefinitive “yes.” To the contrary, however, we have not. We have only held that if a\n\nteacher cannot sue the school board for allegedly failing to comply with MCL\n\n380.1311a(1), standing is not the reason why. In their motion for summary disposition,\n\ndefendants raised several arguments as to why plaintiffs cannot sue the school board\n\nbesides standing, including that plaintiffs have failed to plead a cause of action and that\n\ntheir claims fail as a matter of law.25 Plaintiffs appealed those issues. Because the Court\n\nof Appeals decided the case on the basis of standing alone, and did not reach the other\n\nissues, we remand to that Court to address the remaining issues.26\n\n\n       25\n          As discussed, the merits of a party’s claims and their right to the requested\nremedies were frequently intertwined in the standing analysis erroneously adopted in Lee.\nIndeed, the dissent in this case perfectly models this troubling aspect of that decision.\nBut, under the proper approach to standing, the issues of whether plaintiffs have\nsufficiently pleaded a cause of action and are entitled to the requested remedies are\nindependent of the standing inquiry. Indeed, the issues the dissent raises regarding\nwhether students’ rights would be violated if a court decided to review the school board’s\ndisciplinary hearings and discretionary decision and found that plaintiffs were entitled to\nan injunction expelling the students, are certainly premature at this point.\n       26\n          Just as the dissent’s cries that the historical standing test, in general, will lead to\na stampede to the courthouse ignore that we are reversing a decision that is only nine\nyears old, the dissent’s cries regarding the stampede of lawsuits that will result from this\nspecific case ignore that the Revised School Code predated Lee and yet the courts were\nnot overburdened with similar cases before Lee. The reason for this lack of lawsuits is\nself-evident, as standing is certainly not the only hurdle to prevailing in a case, including\nwinning on the merits. As noted, we are not holding that there is an implied cause of\n\n\n                                               27\n\f       In summary, we hold that plaintiffs have standing because plaintiffs have a\n\nsubstantial interest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(1) that is detrimentally\n\naffected in a manner distinct from that of the general public if the statute is not enforced.\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n       We overrule the standing test adopted in Lee and its progeny and restore Michigan\n\nstanding jurisprudence to be consistent with the doctrine’s long-standing, prudential\n\nroots. We reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and remand to that Court to determine\n\nwhether plaintiffs meet the requirements of MCR 2.605. Further, because we hold that\n\nplaintiffs have standing to pursue their remaining claims, we also remand to the Court of\n\nAppeals for consideration of the issues that it did not previously reach.\n\n\n       KELLY, C.J., and WEAVER (except for the part entitled “Stare Decisis”), and\n\nHATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.\n\n\n\n\naction for private damages under the Revised School Code.

As the dissent’s analysis indicates, these may be difficult\nhurdles to clear.\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f                           STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                  SUPREME COURT\n\n\nLANSING SCHOOLS EDUCATION\nASSOCIATION, MEA/NEA, CATHY\nSTACHWICK, PENNY FILONCZUK,\nELIZABETH NAMIE, and ELLEN\nWHEELER,\n\n             Plaintiffs-Appellants,\n\nv                                                          No. 138401\n\nLANSING BOARD OF EDUCATION and\nLANSING SCHOOL DISTRICT,\n\n             Defendants-Appellees.\n\n\nWEAVER, J.

The\n       majority proudly proclaimed that it was “resisting an expansion of power—\n       not an everyday occurrence in the annals of modern government.”[4]\n       Unfortunately, that statement was not accurate, because the majority\n       showed its lack of judicial restraint by compromising the Legislature’s\n       constitutional duty to enact laws for the protection of the environment and\n       enlarging the Court’s capacity to overrule statutes under the guise of the\n       majority’s self-initiated, erroneous “constitutional” doctrine of standing.[5]\n       [479 Mich at 315.]\n\n       As Justice CAVANAGH’s majority opinion in this case states at footnote 10, I\n\ndescribed in Nat’l Wildlife how the Lee standing doctrine violated separation of powers\n\nunder the Michigan Constitution.

I chose not to sign Chief Justice KELLY’s lead opinion in Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to\n\ncreate a standardized test for stare decisis. Likewise, I do not sign the majority opinion’s\n\nstare decisis section in this case because it applies Petersen. There is no need for this\n\nCourt to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis. In fact, it is an impossible\n\ntask. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule\n\nprecedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case basis.7\n\n       In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly\n\ndecided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and\n\nexercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness—justice for all.\n\n\n\n\n              To give a graphic illustration of my feelings on the subject, I tend to\n       think of the common law as a drunken, toothless ancient relative, sprawled\n       prominently and in a state of nature on a settee in the middle of one’s\n       genteel garden party. Grandpa’s presence is undoubtedly a cause of\n       mortification to the host. But since only the most ill-bred of guests would\n       be coarse enough to comment on Grandpa’s presence and condition, all\n       concerned simply try ignore him.

As stated in Helvering:\n\n              We recognize that stare decisis embodies an important social policy.\n       It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the\n       psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations. But stare decisis is a\n\n\n                                              2\n\f      principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest\n      decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves\n      collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically\n      sounder, and verified by experience.[1]\n\n      I do not agree with any approach to stare decisis that suggests or implies that it is a\n\n“rule” or “law” subject to a particularized test to be used in all circumstances. Any\n\nparticular approach to stare decisis, such as the one taken in Robinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), is not “law” or “established precedent” that would\n\nrequire us to overrule, reject or modify its analysis.

However, the factors used in any of these tests may or may not be\napplicable in any given case.\n       6\n         See Supreme Court Decisions Overruled By Subsequent Decisions, available at\n<http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/048.pdf> (accessed July 28, 2010), for\na partial list of United States Supreme Court cases (covering the period from 1810 to\n2001) that overrule precedent.

Thus, the reasons\n\nfor overruling Lee are paramount to any articulated test and the special and compelling\n\njustifications to do so are overwhelming in this case. As I agree with the well articulated\n\nreasons expressed by Justice CAVANAGH and Justice WEAVER, I will not repeat them\n\nhere.\n\n\n                                                        Diane M.

(dissenting).\n\n      I dissent. In one fell swoop, the majority permits unlimited interference by courts\n\nin the local educational process and rewrites the entire constitutionally based legal\n\ndoctrine governing standing in Michigan. Contrary to the majority’s decision, the lower\n\ncourts correctly concluded that the plaintiff teachers here have no statutory right to\n\ndemand the permanent expulsion of four particular children, and potentially innumerable\n\nother children, from all Michigan schools. Under any meaningful test for standing,\n\nplaintiffs cannot enlist the courts to compel locally elected school districts to expel\n\nstudents under the circumstances presented here.\n\f      The majority reverses the lower courts’ rulings, however, by creating a vague new\n\nstanding “test”—which is really no test at all—that violates the constitutional separation\n\nof powers mandate and gives courts unbounded discretion to overturn the decisions of\n\nother branches of government.         In its haste to overrule this Court’s standing\n\njurisprudence, instead of addressing the issues framed by the parties, the majority asks\n\nand answers a question solely of its own making: whether Lee v Macomb Co Bd of\n\nComm’rs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849158\"><a href=\"/opinion/849158/lee-v-macomb-county-bd-of-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), was correctly decided.1 In doing so, the\n\nmajority jettisons years of binding precedent on the basis of four justices’ current\n\nestimation that the public would be better served by opening the courts to all manner of\n\nchallenges to acts of the legislative and executive branches.

Here it opens the\n\ncourthouse doors for any school teacher, volunteer, contractor or student to demand that a\n\ncourt expel children from their schools even though a local school board has concluded\n\nthat expulsion was inappropriate. The majority thus authorizes courts not only to invade\n\nthe provinces of school districts and the state board of education, but also to deprive\n\nchildren of their rights to public education without affording them any due process\n\nprotections or legal representation. Indeed, none of the children targeted for expulsion\n\nare even named as parties in this suit. It is unfathomable that a court nonetheless has the\n\npower to permanently expel them from school—yet the majority so holds.\n\n       Critically, in overruling the entire body of Michigan’s existing standing\n\njurisprudence, the majority eschews the clear understanding of the “judicial power” held\n\nby the framers of our state constitution. It also eliminates our workable, principled\n\nstanding test, which mirrors that of the federal courts and of many state courts with\n\nconstitutions similar to our own. Indeed no state in the union incorporates explicit “case\n\nor controversy” language into its constitution, yet many states explicitly employ the\n\nfederal test—which is rooted in the traditional case or controversy requirement—that we\n\nadopted in Lee.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Finally, in effecting these unprecedented changes to Michigan’s standing\n\njurisprudence, the majority ignores the doctrine of stare decisis while paying lip service\n\nto it. The majority inexplicably concludes that Lee was clearly wrongly decided, and that\n\n“Lee and its progeny departed dramatically from historical jurisprudence,” although each\n\nmember of the current majority who served on this Court during the relevant time\n\nperiod—Justice CAVANAGH, Chief Justice KELLY, and Justice WEAVER—adopted Lee as\n\nthe correct test at some point in the past.2\n\n       For each of these reasons, I vigorously dissent. I would affirm the decision of the\n\nCourt of Appeals, which faithfully and appropriately applied the law of this state in\n\nconcluding that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue this action.\n\n                             I. THE QUESTION PRESENTED\n\n       This case, brought by four Lansing teachers and their union, originally presented a\n\nstraightforward question: can a teacher sue a school board for its failure to expel a student\n\nwho allegedly assaulted that teacher? To be clear, this case does not ask whether the\n\npublic has an interest in the welfare of its teachers; our desire for their safety is\n\nindisputable. Nor does the case ask whether § 1311a of the Revised School Code, MCL\n\n380.1 et seq., requires a school board to expel a student who “commits a physical assault\n\nat school against a person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the\n\n\n       2\n         See Associated Builders, 472 Mich at 126-127 (WEAVER, J.); Lee, 464 Mich at\n750 (KELLY, J., dissenting, joined by CAVANAGH, J.); Detroit Fire Fighters Ass'n v\nDetroit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1281120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1281120/detroit-fire-fighters-assn-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651-652; 537 NW2d 436 (1995) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting in\npart and concurring in part).\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fschool board,” MCL 380.1311a(1); the parties do not dispute the unambiguous language\n\nof this provision. Further, the defendant school board and school district do not argue\n\nthat they may ignore this mandate despite their conclusion following a student\n\ndisciplinary proceeding that a student committed a physical assault as defined by the\n\ncode. Rather, the parties dispute whether plaintiffs have standing to intervene, by way of\n\na collateral civil suit, when they disagree with defendants’ underlying decision that the\n\nacts of the students at issue did not constitute physical assaults for purposes of applying\n\nthe mandatory expulsion provision of MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n       Accordingly, this case specifically asks whether the courts may decide, at the\n\nbehest of a particular teacher, that a school board must permanently expel a particular\n\nstudent without any notice to the student or his parents. The plaintiff teachers argued that\n\nthey should be empowered to seek a court order directing permanent expulsion of\n\nstudents under MCL 380.1311a(1). The majority agrees and holds, under its broad new\n\nstandard, that plaintiffs have standing to proceed.\n\n       This holding is contrary both to settled principles of law regarding when a party\n\nhas statutory and constitutional standing to bring a claim, as well as to the result\n\ndemanded by the particular facts and circumstances of this case. The School Code itself\n\nclearly establishes that the mandate in MCL 380.1311a(1) is to be enforced by the state\n\nexecutive branch and the locally elected school boards. Moreover, it is for the school\n\ndistricts—not the courts or individual teachers—to decide whether a particular student\n\ncommitted an assault requiring expulsion. Plaintiffs offer no justification for the judicial\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fbranch to usurp these powers, which are specifically delegated to other branches of\n\ngovernment.\n\n       Finally, plaintiffs have never described how the courts could successfully\n\nintervene. Their analysis fails to account for the fact that a board’s decision to expel a\n\nstudent occurs only after a disciplinary proceeding where the student’s constitutional\n\nrights are protected and where the board must make a careful, discretionary, factual\n\ndecision concerning whether the student had the requisite intent to commit a “physical\n\nassault” as defined by the school code. According to the Michigan Association of School\n\nBoards, more than 100,000 such disciplinary proceedings occur in Michigan each school\n\nyear. Yet plaintiffs seek to intervene after the fact in a case where the students are not\n\nrepresented, asking the Court to revisit and overrule innumerable decisions of the elected\n\nschool boards. Moreover, plaintiffs never explain why other enforcement mechanisms—\n\nincluding not only the explicit statutory enforcement provisions, but also negotiations\n\nwith the school board under their collective bargaining agreement—are inadequate to\n\nensure appropriate enforcement of the applicable statute.\n\n       Thus, like the lower courts, I cannot conclude that teachers have standing to obtain\n\ncourt orders compelling expulsion of students in contravention of a school board’s\n\ndecision that the students’ acts did not require expulsion. Perhaps most significantly, by\n\nchoosing to overrule this Court’s constitutional standing doctrine sua sponte, the majority\n\ngives the courts carte blanche to invade the school board’s decision-making province,\n\ndepriving those boards of their constitutionally delegated responsibilities and depriving\n\nstudents of their rights to public education without affording them due process. This case\n\n\n                                            6\n\fthus illustrates the absolutely untenable nature of the majority’s new approach—an\n\napproach that, unfortunately, is characteristic of the majority’s assault on the rule of law.\n\n      A. LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE REVISED SCHOOL CODE\n\n            1. GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS\n\n       The Revised School Code, originally enacted in 1976,3 describes the “rights,\n\npowers, and duties” of school districts.      MCL 380.11a(3).       The powers and duties\n\noriginate from the Michigan Constitution, which established that the “legislature shall\n\nmaintain and support a system of free public elementary and secondary schools . . . .”\n\nConst 1963, art 8, § 2. Consistent with this mandate, the Legislature enacted the school\n\ncode and provided that school districts would be governed by locally elected school\n\nboards. MCL 380.11a(5), (7). The constitution also vested “[l]eadership and general\n\nsupervision over all public education” in the elected members of the state board of\n\neducation. Const 1963, art 8, § 3.\n\n       Significantly, both the constitution and the school code make plain that school\n\ndistricts’ central purposes are the education and protection of students. Const 1963, art 8,\n\n§ 2, requires a system of free public schools and states simply: “Every school district\n\nshall provide for the education of its pupils without discrimination as to religion, creed,\n\nrace, color or national origin.” The school code, in turn, defines district functions to\n\ninclude “[e]ducating pupils,” MCL 380.11a(3)(a), and “[p]roviding for the safety and\n\nwelfare of pupils while at school or a school sponsored activity or while en route to or\n\n       3\n           </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\ffrom school or a school sponsored activity,” MCL 380.11a(3)(b). A district’s functions\n\nwith regard to employees, however, center on “[h]iring, contracting for, scheduling,\n\nsupervising, or terminating employees, independent contractors, and others to carry out\n\nschool district powers.” MCL 380.11a(3)(d).\n\n          2. DISCIPLINARY POWERS AND DUTIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS\n\n      School districts’ powers and duties with regard to students include disciplinary\n\nmeasures subject to varying degrees of discretion by the board and its employees. For\n\nexample, a district has discretion to suspend or expel a student who is “guilty of gross\n\nmisdemeanor or persistent disobedience if, in the judgment of the school board or its\n\ndesignee, as applicable, the interest of the school is served” by suspension or expulsion.\n\nMCL 380.1311(1). A school board must permanently expel4 a student under certain\n\ncircumstances, including possession of a weapon (subject to some exceptions), arson, or\n\ncriminal sexual conduct on school grounds.       MCL 380.1311(2).      Even under these\n\ncircumstances, however, the student or his parent may petition for reinstatement to public\n\neducation when a period of up to 180 days has elapsed after his expulsion. MCL\n\n380.1311(5).\n\n      The statutory provision at issue in this case, MCL 380.1311a(1), was added to the\n\nschool code by the Legislature in 1999 as one of several bills—including the safe schools\n\n\n      4\n         Permanent expulsion generally means that a student may not attend any public\nschool in Michigan. But expelled students may be eligible to attend alternative education\nprograms and strict discipline academies or to receive in-home instructional services.\nMCL 380.1311(3).\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fand communities law, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">—addressing school safety and student discipline.5\n\nThe 1999 bills mandated a statewide school safety information policy to be\n\ncollaboratively adopted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Attorney\n\nGeneral, and the director of the Department of State Police. MCL 380.1308(1). The bills\n\nalso enacted guidelines for student discipline under various circumstances and established\n\nstrict discipline academies, MCL 380.1311b, for particular students, including those\n\nexpelled from their regular public schools, MCL 380.1311g(3)(b), (c).\n\n      MCL 380.1311a(1) requires permanent expulsion “[i]f a pupil enrolled in grade 6\n\nor above commits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged\n\nas a volunteer or contractor by the school board” and the assault is properly reported to\n\nschool officials. For purposes of this section, “physical assault” means “intentionally\n\ncausing or attempting to cause physical harm to another through force or violence.”\n\nMCL 380.1311a(12)(b).\n\n                                  3. ENFORCEMENT\n\n      The school code’s provisions are enforced by several mechanisms. First, school\n\nboard members, school officials, and any “other person who neglects or refuses to do or\n\nperform an act” required by the code, or “who violates or knowingly permits or consents\n\nto a violation” of the code, is subject to misdemeanor prosecution. MCL 380.1804.\n\nSecond, under MCL 380.1806, a school board “may dismiss from employment and\n\ncancel the contract of a superintendent, principal, or teacher who neglects or refuses to\n\n      5\n          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> to 104; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fcomply” with the code. Third, because the members of school boards and the state board\n\nof education are elected officials, their acts and policies are regularly reviewed—and\n\naccepted or rejected—by the electorate.\n\n      It is also significant that the Legislature has enacted a comprehensive, carefully\n\nmonitored scheme to address safety within our schools. For example, the statewide\n\nschool safety information policy requires school officials to report various school\n\nincidents to law enforcement agencies for investigation.      MCL 380.1308(2)(a), (3).\n\nIncidents that require reporting under this section are defined by members of the\n\nexecutive branch, MCL 380.1308(1), “taking into account the intent of the actor and the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the incident,” MCL 380.1308(2)(b).          School boards are\n\nrequired to submit reports that state the number of students expelled during each year and\n\nthe reasons for expulsion, MCL 380.1310a(1), and list crimes including those “involving\n\nphysical violence,” committed at schools, MCL 380.1310a(2).           These reports are\n\nultimately intended, in part, to help policymakers, school districts, communities, and law\n\nenforcement officials “identify the most pressing safety issues confronting their school\n\ncommunities,” “enhance campus safety through prevention and intervention strategies,”\n\n“prevent further crime and violence and . . . assure a safe learning environment for every\n\npupil.” MCL 380.1310a(2)(c), (d). Finally, it is noteworthy that many school districts\n\nare now empowered to create law enforcement agencies within their school systems.\n\nMCL 380.1240.\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f                   B. TEACHERS’ STANDING TO SUE UNDER\n                 SECTION 1311a OF THE REVISED SCHOOL CODE\n\n           1. STANDING AND GROUNDS FOR COURT INTERVENTION\n\n       Despite the Legislature’s comprehensive system, through which executive branch\n\nofficials and local districts set evolving policies and monitor responses to school safety,\n\nthe plaintiff teachers here ask the courts to intervene and dictate the Lansing School\n\nDistrict’s responses to four past incidents—and potentially innumerable future\n\nincidents—involving student misbehavior. Each of the named plaintiffs alleges that she\n\nwas physically assaulted by a middle school student6 and, therefore, that the court should\n\norder permanent expulsion of each student under MCL 380.1311a(1). Plaintiffs further\n\nasked the court to: permanently enjoin defendants from violating MCL 380.1311a in the\n\nfuture; find school officials and board members guilty of misdemeanors for violating the\n\nschool code under MCL 380.1804; and cancel the contracts of the superintendent and any\n\nprincipal for failing to comply with the school code under MCL 380.1806.\n\n       Plaintiffs sought this relief by requesting a declaratory judgment under MCR\n\n2.605, which permits a court to “declare the rights and other legal relations of an\n\n       6\n          Plaintiffs allege that one student threw a leather wristband with metal spikes,\nwhich hit a bulletin board “about two inches” from the plaintiff teacher’s head, bounced,\nand hit the teacher in the face. Plaintiffs further allege that two students separately hit\nplaintiff teachers with chairs. Each teacher suffered bruises as a result. A fourth student\nallegedly slapped a plaintiff teacher on the back with enough force to cause stinging and\nto leave a pink mark. Plaintiffs state that each of these incidents was properly reported to\nschool officials and each student was suspended but not expelled. The parties agree that\nthe defendant school board apparently concluded that none of the four students named in\nthe complaint committed “physical assaults” as defined by the code and, therefore,\nexpulsion was not mandated by MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\finterested party seeking a declaratory judgment . . . .” MCR 2.605(A)(1). They also\n\nsought a writ of mandamus under MCR 3.305, which requires a plaintiff to prove “it has\n\na clear legal right to performance of the specific duty sought to be compelled and the\n\ndefendant has a clear legal duty to perform such act.” Baraga Co v State Tax Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848913\"><a href=\"/opinion/848913/baraga-county-v-state-tax-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268; 645 NW2d 13 (2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nDefendants moved for summary dismissal of plaintiffs’ complaint, arguing that plaintiffs\n\ndid not have standing to seek either remedy.\n\n       Traditional standing principles apply to plaintiffs seeking declaratory relief,\n\nAssociated Builders, 472 Mich at 125, or writs of mandamus, e.g. Detroit Fire Fighters\n\nAss'n v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1281120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1281120/detroit-fire-fighters-assn-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633; 537 NW2d 436 (1995).

Therefore, until today, plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing each of the\n\nfollowing elements of standing in order to invoke court jurisdiction:\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f              First, the plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact”—an\n      invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and\n      particularized, and (b) “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or\n      ‘hypothetical.’” Second, there must be a causal connection between the\n      injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be “fairly . . .\n      trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result\n      [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.”\n      Third, it must be “likely,” as opposed to merely “speculative,” that the\n      injury will be “redressed by a favorable decision.” [Lujan v Defenders of\n      Wildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560-561; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Plaintiffs also have not shown\n\nthat defendants had a clear legal duty to expel the students under the facts presented or\n\nthat plaintiffs’ interests can be addressed by a favorable court decision. Therefore, they\n\ncannot establish standing to seek relief against the school board under MCL\n\n380.1311a(1).\n\n        2. THE ALLEGED RIGHT TO RELIEF ASSERTED BY PLAINTIFFS\n\n      Plaintiffs argue that the text of MCL 380.1311a(1) creates an enforceable right in\n\nteachers and a corresponding duty owed by school districts to teachers. To determine\n\nwhether a plaintiff has standing created by a statute, the court begins by considering “the\n\nstatutory language to determine legislative intent.” Miller v Allstate Ins Co, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">601</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610; 751 NW2d 463 (2008). As an initial matter, many of the cases cited by\n\nplaintiffs on this point are inapposite because they address whether a statute creates or\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fimplies a right of action for damages against a private party.7 The inquiry is different\n\nwhen, as here, a governmental agency is involved. Because governmental agencies are\n\ngenerally immune from suit under the governmental tort liability act, MCL 691.1407,8 a\n\nplaintiff may sue a governmental agency for damages only when the Legislature\n\nexpressly so authorizes. Lash v Traverse City, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194; 735 NW2d 628\n\n(2007); Mack v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848846\"><a href=\"/opinion/848846/mack-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195-196; 649 NW2d 47 (2002). These cases do\n\nnot establish that a plaintiff may infer a private cause of action for damages against a\n\ngovernmental agency.     Rather, in a suit against a governmental agency, a plaintiff\n\ngenerally may seek only injunctive or declaratory relief upon showing that the particular\n\nplaintiff has a clear, legally enforceable right that the particular defendant had a duty to\n\nprotect. Lash, 479 Mich at 196.\n\n       Some of the relief requested by plaintiffs is clearly unavailable because they\n\nimproperly ask the court to require the executive branch and the school district to make\n\n\n       7\n         E.g.

Although a plaintiff may seek to compel\n\nthe exercise of discretion through a writ of mandamus, he may not compel the exercise of\n\ndiscretion “in a particular manner.” State Bd of Ed v Houghton Lake Community Sch,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1827436\"><a href=\"/opinion/1827436/state-bd-of-ed-v-houghton-lake-community-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666; 425 NW2d 80 (1988) (emphasis added). Courts are not empowered\n\nto require the school board to cancel an employee’s contract for failing to comply with\n\nthe school code. Rather, MCL 380.1806 clearly establishes that a decision to terminate\n\nan employee under these circumstances lies within the board’s discretion because the\n\nstatute states that the board “may” dismiss an employee for violating the code. A\n\nstatute’s use of the word “may” in this context conveys discretion to act, it does not\n\nrequire the act. See Warda v Flushing City Council, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332; 696 NW2d 671\n\n(2005).    Similarly, a court has no power to find individual officials guilty of\n\nmisdemeanors under MCL 380.1804 in this civil case. “The power to determine whether\n\nto charge a defendant [with a criminal offense] and what charge should be brought is an\n\nexecutive power, which vests exclusively in the prosecutor.” People v Gillis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"846560\"><a href=\"/opinion/846560/people-v-gillis/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 n 19; 712 NW2d 419 (2006); Const 1963, art 3, § 2.9 Indeed, not only is this a\n\ncivil case, but plaintiffs failed to name any individual defendants, so no potentially liable\n\nindividuals are even parties against whom relief may be sought.\n\n\n       9\n         And see People v Chavis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 n 6; 658 NW2d 469 (2003): “It is\ninvariably the case that the prosecutor always has great discretion in deciding whether to\nfile charges. Such executive branch power is an established part of our constitutional\nstructure.” The prosecutor’s powers in this regard are tempered by “systemic protections\nafforded defendants” incident to criminal trials and by “elections, which call all office\nholders to account to their constituents.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       Accordingly, the only obtainable relief sought by plaintiffs depends on their\n\nargument that they have a clear, legally protected right to the expulsion of the four\n\nstudents described in the complaint and, potentially, to innumerable future students.\n\nThey stress that MCL 380.1311a(1) addresses assaults on a specific, circumscribed group\n\nof people—any “person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the\n\nschool board”—that includes teachers like themselves. But nothing in the code suggests\n\nthat the statute therefore creates an enforceable right in, or a duty to, this group of people.\n\nAs explained above, the text of the 1999 statutory amendments is aimed at creating a\n\ncomprehensive, statewide program of student discipline governed by the state board of\n\neducation and the local districts. There is no indication of a legislative intent to create\n\nnew rights in teachers beyond their explicit statutory and contract rights.10\n\n       Plaintiffs cite two cases in which courts entertained suits brought by teachers who\n\nsought interpretation of school code provisions: Detroit Federation of Teachers v Detroit\n\nBd of Ed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2215403\"><a href=\"/opinion/2215403/dft-v-detroit-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 240 NW2d 225 (1976) (addressing the former code that\n\npredated the 1976 revised code), and Roek v Chippewa Valley Sch Dist, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1582377\"><a href=\"/opinion/1582377/roek-v-chippewa-valley-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

In Detroit Federation of Teachers, this Court agreed with the\n\ncircuit court’s declaratory decision stating that the defendant board “shall enter into a\n\nwritten, individual contract with each ‘duly qualified’ teacher in its employ” because\n\n\n       10\n           The only authority plaintiffs cited to support their oft-stated conclusion that\nMCL 380.1311a(1) was specifically intended to protect employee safety is HB 5802,\nwhich became </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> did not enact MCL 380.1311a, as\nplaintiffs incorrectly assumed.\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fwritten contracts with teachers were required by former MCL 340.569, but we concluded\n\nthat the lower courts erred by directing the kind of contract individual teachers would\n\nreceive. 396 Mich at 222, 226. In Roek, the Court resolved the parties’ dispute over\n\nlanguage in MCL 380.1236(2), concluding on the basis of undisputed facts that the\n\nplaintiff qualified, as a matter of law, as a teacher employed as a substitute teacher for\n\n120 days or more during a school year and thus had the basic right to be given first\n\nopportunity to accept or reject a contract under certain circumstances. 122 Mich App at\n\n78-79. Neither of these cases supports plaintiffs’ claim for standing here.\n\n       These cases were concerned with teachers seeking judicial action with regard to\n\nteacher contracts. Thus, the cases addressed issues germane to teachers as direct parties\n\nto statutorily specified employment relationships. Moreover, because the cases involved\n\nthe defendants’ duties to teachers in the employment context, the subject matter fell\n\ndirectly within the scope of specified district functions with regard to employees, which\n\ninclude “contracting.” MCL 380.11a(3)(d). More importantly, Detroit Federation of\n\nTeachers, in particular, is most significant for what it did not do. Although Detroit\n\nFederation of Teachers confirmed the mandatory requirement for written contracts under\n\nthe school code, it reversed the circuit court’s writ of mandamus “directing the kind of\n\ncontract particular teachers would receive.” 396 Mich at 224. It concluded that the\n\n“right protected by the code is the right to a written contract evidencing the employment\n\nrelationship, not to a particular kind of contract.” Id. at 227. Accordingly, the court had\n\nno power to govern the details of the parties’ contractual powers and duties, which the\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fstatute left to be determined through their collective bargaining process or the grievance\n\nprocedure provided by their collective bargaining agreement. Id.\n\n       The case before us does not arise from the parties’ request for the court to\n\ninterpret, as a matter of law, mandatory statutory language addressing teacher contracts.\n\nRather the parties agree that the statutory language is unambiguous and needs no further\n\ninterpretation. Instead, plaintiffs asked the court to revisit a school board’s discretionary\n\nfactual decision as it relates to a disciplinary scheme governing defendants’ responses to\n\nstudent behavior in student disciplinary proceedings.          Thus, instead of supporting\n\nplaintiffs’ argument, the holdings of Detroit Federation of Teachers and Roek depend on\n\ncontrasting facts and illustrate that this case does not involve a statute creating a clear\n\nright in plaintiffs or a clear duty on defendants’ part as their employer.\n\n       Crucially, plaintiffs’ reasoning is by no means limited to teachers. Upon accepting\n\nplaintiffs’ claim that they have an enforceable right under MCL 380.1311a(1), the\n\nmajority establishes that every person mentioned in the student disciplinary statutes now\n\nhas standing to challenge a decision of a school board declining to expel a student who is\n\naccused of assault. As previously discussed, MCL 380.1311a(1) addresses disciplinary\n\nmeasures with regard to students who assault school employees, volunteers, and\n\ncontractors. MCL 380.1310(1), in turn, addresses disciplinary measures when a “pupil\n\nenrolled in grade 6 or above commits a physical assault at school against another pupil.”\n\nThe two provisions are similarly worded and, therefore, the majority’s conclusion that the\n\nteachers have standing to sue here applies with equal force not only to other school\n\nemployees, volunteers and contractors, but to every student who alleges he was\n\n\n                                             18\n\fphysically assaulted by another student. Yet nothing in the school code indicates that the\n\nLegislature intended to create a new right in all school volunteers, contractors,\n\nemployees, or students to compel the expulsion of students, thus opening the floodgates\n\nfor—and overwhelming the courts with—collateral litigation whenever one such person\n\nis dissatisfied with a board’s resolution of a student disciplinary proceeding. For these\n\nreasons, plaintiffs simply have not met their burden to show that the Legislature intended\n\nto create a legally protected right in teachers when it enacted MCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n                              3. PLAINTIFFS’ REMEDIES\n\n       Plaintiffs’ claims fail primarily for the above reason: the Revised School Code\n\ndoes not clearly create legal rights in teachers to compel expulsion of students under\n\nMCL 380.1311a(1). But plaintiffs have also failed to show that the Legislature intended\n\nto authorize private suits to enforce MCL 380.1311a(1) or that the other statutory\n\nenforcement mechanisms are not exclusive under these circumstances.            These latter\n\nfailures independently defeat plaintiffs’ claim that judicial relief is available to them in\n\nthis case.\n\n       With regard to plaintiffs’ mandamus complaint, relief is available only if “the law\n\nhas established no specific remedy” for a duty created by law. Houghton Sch, 430 Mich\n\nat 667. The cases cited by plaintiffs similarly hold that, when a right or duty is imposed\n\nby statute, “the remedy provided for enforcement of that right by the statute for its\n\nviolation and nonperformance is exclusive.” Pompey, 385 Mich at 552. As already\n\ndiscussed, the Legislature clearly vested enforcement of the code and its provisions in the\n\nexecutive branch, through misdemeanor prosecutions under MCL 380.1804, and local\n\n\n                                            19\n\fschool districts, which have discretionary power to terminate employees and officials\n\nwho violate the terms of the code, MCL 380.1806. With regard to school safety, the code\n\nprovides an additional layer of local and executive branch monitoring and enforcement\n\nthrough the statewide school safety information policy, MCL 380.1308, and reporting\n\nrequirements, MCL 380.1310a.        Thus, the code’s express terms provide particular\n\nremedies applicable to MCL 380.1311a. This should end the inquiry; these remedies\n\ngenerally should be deemed exclusive.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue, nonetheless, that they may still seek declaratory or mandamus\n\nrelief if the statutory remedies are inadequate.     This Court has never accepted the\n\nargument that courts may create new remedies for the violation of statutory duties on the\n\nbasis of a party’s claim that existing statutory remedies are inadequate. In Lash, this\n\nCourt rejected the argument—which is rooted in dictum from Pompey, 385 Mich at 552 n\n\n14—that an additional remedy might be permitted to supplement a statutory remedy if the\n\nstatutory remedy is “plainly inadequate”; we noted that this dubious principle “has never\n\nsince been cited in any majority opinion of this Court” and “appears inconsistent with\n\nsubsequent caselaw.” Lash, 479 Mich at 192 n 19. Plaintiffs nonetheless suggest that the\n\nprinciple was followed in a Court of Appeals case, Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which cited\n\nPompey and Long v Chelsea Community Hosp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583; 557 NW2d 157\n\n(1996), for the proposition that “a cause of action can be inferred from the fact that the\n\nstatute provides no adequate means of enforcement of its provisions.” Yet Lane itself\n\nconcluded that the plaintiff could not bring suit in part because the act at issue—the child\n\ncare organizations act, MCL 722.111 et seq.—“adequately provides for enforcement of\n\n\n                                            20\n\fits provisions” through provisions similar to those present in the school code, including\n\ncriminal penalties and proceedings instituted by the Attorney General. Lane, 231 Mich at\n\n696. Notably, the comparable statutory remedies available in this case are ignored by the\n\nmajority opinion.\n\n       In any event, plaintiffs certainly have not shown that the available enforcement\n\nmechanisms are inadequate. In addition to the statutory mechanisms discussed above—\n\nand in addition to the fact that school board members, as elected officials, must answer to\n\nthe public for their acts and policies—plaintiffs never address why their contractual\n\nbargaining process is inadequate to address their safety concerns. Indeed, plaintiffs\n\nconcede that their bargaining agreement with defendants includes provisions to protect\n\nthe workplace safety of its members.11 Thus, consistent with the code’s acknowledgment\n\nof the contract-based relationship between a teacher and a school district, it appears clear\n\nthat plaintiffs not only have an enforcement mechanism at hand but—as in Detroit\n\nFederation of Teachers with regard to the non-justiciable contract terms—may make use\n\nof their bargaining process or grievance procedure to address alleged violations of their\n\nalleged rights to workplace safety. Defendants also reasonably argue that plaintiffs are\n\nclearly empowered to protect themselves by reporting alleged student assaults to their\n\nlocal prosecutor for criminal investigation.\n\n\n\n       11\n          Plaintiffs expressly affirm in their brief that the plaintiff union “has bargained\nlanguage in its master agreement with Defendants-Appellees to protect the workplace\nsafety of its members.”\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\f      Finally, in light of the broad powers the school code establishes in executive\n\nbranch officials and local school boards, permitting individual plaintiffs to enforce MCL\n\n380.1311a could violate both the terms of the code and the Michigan Constitution.\n\nAlthough this Court continues to debate the constitutional ramifications of our standing\n\ndoctrine, we do not disagree about the constitutionally mandated separation of powers\n\namong our three branches of government: “No person exercising powers of one branch\n\nshall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided\n\nin th[e] constitution.” Const 1963, art 3, § 2. Thus, it is clear that the courts cannot\n\nexercise powers expressly allocated to other branches of government.            Here, the\n\nconstitution expressly granted the power to create and supervise public schools to the\n\nstate board of education, Const 1963, art 8, § 3, and the Legislature, Const 1963, art 8,\n\n§ 2, which has delegated governance of the schools in part to the local school boards,\n\nMCL 380.11a(5), (7). Accordingly, the constitution itself supports the conclusion that\n\ncourts may not compel acts of the local school boards without express, constitutionally\n\nsound authorization to do so. The trial court made this very point in its decision granting\n\nsummary disposition:\n\n              Basically, the premise here is that this Court in some fashion or\n      another has the right to look behind the exercise of discretion by the\n      Lansing School District. I don’t think we have any more right to do that\n      than we have to [sic] the Lansing City Council. The Lansing City Counsel\n      [sic] is another branch of government. It’s not our prerogative. That’s\n      not—that’s not something for the Court to do.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f                     4. REDRESSABILITY AND THE EFFECTS ON\n                        STUDENTS’ CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n\n       On a related significant point, plaintiffs offer no workable means by which a court\n\ncould enforce their alleged rights to expulsion of students under MCL 380.1311a(1) even\n\nif the court had some power to intervene through declaratory relief or a mandamus order.\n\nPlaintiffs’ failure in this regard informs and strengthens the conclusion that the statute\n\ndoes not create legally enforceable rights in, or duties to, plaintiffs at all.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ complaint depends entirely on their allegation that the four named\n\nstudents committed “physical assaults” as defined by the code. Plaintiffs tacitly proceed\n\nas if this allegation was undisputed or could be decided by the court. To the contrary, the\n\nparties agree that the factual determination whether a student committed a physical\n\nassault for purposes of the school code is a discretionary one for the school board.\n\nAlthough no authority suggests that a teacher has standing to appeal a school board’s\n\ndisciplinary decision with regard to a particular student, the Court of Appeals has\n\nconcluded that when a student appeals such a decision, “in reviewing the disciplinary\n\norders of a school administration, the courts of this state are bound by that\n\nadministration’s factual findings so long as they are supported by competent, material\n\nand substantial evidence.” Birdsey v Grand Blanc Community Sch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1246792\"><a href=\"/opinion/1246792/birdsey-v-grand-blanc-community-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Despite this deferential\n\nstandard for direct appeals of administrative decisions, both the plaintiffs and the\n\nmajority would accord no deference in a collateral appeal to the school board’s apparent\n\ndetermination that the four named students did not commit physical assaults as defined\n\nby MCL 380.1311a(12)(b).\n\n       Although we accept as true the facts alleged by a plaintiff in a complaint for\n\npurposes of a defendant’s motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8),\n\nKuznar v Raksha Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"839447\"><a href=\"/opinion/839447/kuznar-v-raksha-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176; 750 NW2d 121 (2008), plaintiffs’\n\ncharacterization of each event as a “physical assault” as defined by MCL\n\n380.1311a(12)(b) is a conclusion drawn from the statutory terms—not a fact.12\n\nAccordingly, a court cannot simply accept this allegation as true or presume that, if the\n\ncase proceeds, it can be resolved in plaintiffs’ favor by a finder of fact at trial. Rather,\n\nthe allegation has apparently already been resolved to the contrary by the entity that\n\nplaintiffs concede is the proper forum—the school board. Under these circumstances,\n\n\n       12\n          Compare Davis v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379 n 1; 711 NW2d 462 (2006)\n(“Plaintiff’s reliance on her allegation in her complaint that the city was engaged in a\nproprietary activity is unwarranted because only factual allegations, not legal\nconclusions, are to be taken as true under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and (8).”). Moreover,\nalthough plaintiffs have not properly placed in issue the school board’s determinations, I\nnote that the students’ alleged acts, see ante, ___ do not unquestionably constitute\nphysical assaults under MCL 380.1311a(12)(b), as plaintiffs simply presume.\nParticularly because the statutory definition of “physical assault” includes a specific\nintent element—“intentionally causing or attempting to cause physical harm,” MCL\n380.1311a(12)(b)—the finder of fact at a disciplinary proceeding could conclude, on the\nbasis of the mental state of the student or the circumstances surrounding each assault, that\nthe student did not affirmatively intend to cause physical harm to his or her teacher.\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fplaintiffs could achieve relief only if they can show, first, that the school board abused its\n\ndiscretion when it determined that the four students’ acts did not constitute physical\n\nassaults and, second, that the court has the power to conclude that the board erred and\n\nthen to overturn the board’s determination in a suit brought by teachers. But plaintiffs\n\nnever explain whether or how the court could review or overturn the board’s\n\ndeterminations in student disciplinary proceedings that have long-since concluded, let\n\nalone by way of this collateral suit in which the students at issue are not even represented.\n\n       Indeed, all other issues aside, plaintiffs’ claims with regard to the four named\n\nstudents appear moot in any event because the disciplinary proceedings concluded years\n\nago. The alleged assaults occurred in January 2007, September 2006, May 2006, and\n\nOctober 2005. Even if some of the students are still enrolled in the district, plaintiffs\n\nprovide no authority suggesting that they could be expelled now; had they been expelled\n\nat the time of the incidents, by now each of them could have petitioned for reinstatement\n\nto public school under MCL 380.1311a(5) (a court may grant a petition for reinstatement\n\nbeginning 180 days after the date of expulsion, MCL 380.1311a[5][(b]).13\n\n       With regard to future students, plaintiffs do not explain how a declaratory\n\njudgment requiring defendants to comply with MCL 380.1311a(1) would have any effect\n\nwhatsoever. Whether a student committed a physical assault is determined on a case-by-\n\n\n       13\n         Further, because it was the students’ behavior that injured plaintiffs, plaintiffs’\nprayer for relief with regard to the four named students appears untenable for the simple\nreason that the alleged injuries were not caused by defendants’ failure to expel the\nstudents after the assaults.\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fcase basis depending on the particular facts and in accordance with the student’s\n\nconstitutional rights. Therefore, the most a court could do would be to redundantly repeat\n\nthe undisputed terms of the statute itself: “If a pupil enrolled in grade 6 or above\n\ncommits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged as a\n\nvolunteer or contractor by the school board . . . , then the school board . . . shall expel the\n\npupil from the school district permanently, subject to possible reinstatement . . . .” MCL\n\n380.1311a(1) (emphasis added).        Plaintiffs’ claimed relief thus supports defendants’\n\nsuggestion that what plaintiffs really desire is for the court—or the plaintiffs\n\nthemselves—to determine whether a “physical assault” occurred for purposes of applying\n\nMCL 380.1311a(1).\n\n       Finally, as noted, permitting plaintiffs’ complaint to proceed here permits any\n\nperson who alleges he is the victim of student misbehavior to independently sue the board\n\nwhen the board concludes that the student’s acts did not qualify for mandatory\n\nsuspension or expulsion. That is, under the majority’s analysis, any employee, volunteer,\n\nor contractor of the school may now collaterally sue on the basis of assault allegations\n\nunder MCL 380.1311a(1). And any student may sue, seeking suspension or expulsion of\n\na fellow student, on the basis of assault allegations under MCL 380.1310(1). And these\n\nsuits may be filed although the student disciplinary proceeding is over and although the\n\naccused student’s rights are not represented because he is not a party to the lawsuit.\n\n       Crucially, neither the majority nor plaintiffs ever address the rights of the accused\n\nstudents. Students have a property interest in their entitlement to public education that\n\ncannot be “taken away for misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures\n\n\n                                              26\n\frequired by [the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment],” US Const, Am\n\nXIV.

CONCLUSION: PLAINTIFFS CLEARLY LACK STANDING AND THE\n  MAJORITY’S CONCLUSIONTO THE CONTRARY ILLUSTRATES THE FATAL\n          PROBLEMS WITH ITS NEW APPROACH TO STANDING\n\n       Plaintiffs have not borne their burden to show that they satisfy any of the\n\napplicable requirements for standing under Lee, as both lower courts correctly concluded.\n\nPlaintiffs have not shown that MCL 380.1311a(1) creates a legally protected and\n\nredressable interest in teachers for which the courts may provide relief, particularly in a\n\ncase involving only the teachers and the school district, but not the students at issue.\n\nFurther, the foregoing discussion shows that plaintiffs could not satisfy any meaningful\n\nstanding test.\n\n       Indeed, plaintiffs could not assert standing even under the former tests the\n\nmajority cites with approval. Significantly, the parties essentially agree that the outcome\n\n\n       14\n           Goss applies because Michigan maintains a public school system, Const 1963,\nart 8, § 2, and requires children to attend, MCL 380.1561. See Goss, 419 US at 574.\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\fhere would be the same whether standing is analyzed under Lee, Detroit Fire Fighters,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1281120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1281120/detroit-fire-fighters-assn-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, or House Speaker v Governor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1955973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1955973/house-speaker-v-governor/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 506 NW2d 190 (1993). We\n\nagree. First, as discussed above, we see no indication that the Legislature intended to\n\ncreate a right or “substantial interest” in plaintiffs, see House Speaker, 443 Mich at 572,\n\nby enacting MCL 380.1311a(1). Further, to the extent plaintiffs refer to their general\n\ninterest in their personal safety while at work, this interest is separate and independent\n\nfrom the student discipline provisions of the Revised School Code; plaintiffs can protect\n\nthis interest through all the normal channels, including contract negotiations and\n\ncomplaints to local law enforcement. Second, plaintiffs’ general interest in a safe school\n\nenvironment is analogous to the safety interests claimed by the plaintiffs in Detroit Fire\n\nFighters, where Justice WEAVER agreed that the plaintiff firefighters and their collective\n\nbargaining unit did not have standing to challenge an alleged violation of the Detroit City\n\nCharter. Detroit Fire Fighters, 449 Mich at 631-632. Justice WEAVER concluded that\n\nthe firefighters did not have a “substantial interest” that “will be detrimentally affected in\n\na manner different from the public at large” although they claimed that lack of funding\n\nfor additional firefighters subjected them to increased risk of injury, among other things.\n\nId. at 633 (opinion by WEAVER, J.). Specifically, she opined that the plaintiffs could not\n\nshow “injury distinct from the general citizenry” because a lack of firefighters also\n\nthreatened injury to members of the general public who occupied buildings that catch\n\nfire. Id. at 638. The Legislature’s purported interests in ensuring safe and effective\n\nlearning environments similarly benefit the public at large. Safe schools, and the removal\n\nof violent students when appropriate, benefit not only all employees, volunteers,\n\n\n                                             28\n\fcontractors and students, but also parents, families, and any other member of the public\n\nwho has occasion to enter a school. Indeed, the entire community that supports a school\n\nsystem has “an interest” in school safety: safe school environments benefit taxpayers,\n\nwho fund all aspects of school functions. Although not every member of the public is\n\naffected equally by school environments, the same was true in Detroit Fire Fighters;\n\nclearly not every member of the public frequently finds himself at risk inside a burning\n\nbuilding, and clearly firefighters find themselves inside burning buildings more often\n\nthan other individual citizens.15\n\n       Yet the majority rejects this Court’s standing test and concludes, without any\n\nexamination of the school code or the ramifications for students’ constitutional rights,\n\nthat plaintiffs—and, by necessary analogy, all school employees, contractors, volunteers\n\nand fellow students—have standing. As I have explained, the school code is replete with\n\nclear indications that the Legislature did not intend to create a right of action in teachers\n\nunder MCL 380.1311a(1) and intended for the school code to be enforced under MCL\n\n380.1804 and MCL 380.1806. The majority concludes otherwise by simply observing\n\nthat MCL 380.1311a “suggests that plaintiffs have a substantial and distinct interest.”\n\n(Emphasis added.) Then, without citation and contrary to the most essential tenet of\n\nstatutory interpretation, the majority expressly departs from the statutory text and states\n\n       15\n          Most critically, the disciplinary provisions of the school code name not just\nteachers, but all employees, contractors, volunteers and students. The statutory language\nnowhere suggests that the Legislature intended for all these subclasses of the public to\nbring their individual complaints concerning school boards’ disciplinary proceedings to\nthe courthouse.\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fthat, although the Legislature has not unambiguously expressed an intent to confer\n\nstanding, a court may confer standing by consulting legislative history at will.16 This\n\nassertion is indisputably erroneous. The proper interpretation of a statute always begins\n\nwith the unambiguous statutory text. As this Court recently affirmed in a unanimous\n\nopinion authored by Chief Justice KELLY, the “first step” in discerning the intent of the\n\nLegislature “is to review the language of the statute.” Briggs Tax Service, LLC v Detroit\n\nPublic Schools, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76; 780 NW2d 753 (2010). “[W]e consider both the plain\n\nmeaning of the critical word or phrase as well as “‘its placement and purpose in the\n\nstatutory scheme.’” Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1984889\"><a href=\"/opinion/1984889/sun-valley-foods-co-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237; 596 NW2d 119\n\n(1999) (citation omitted). If the statutory language is unambiguous, we presume that the\n\nLegislature intended the meaning expressed in the statute. Briggs Tax Service, 485 Mich\n\nat 76.       Accordingly, as Justice CAVANAGH himself stated in In re MCI\n\nTelecommunications Complaint, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985493\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985493/in-re-mci-telecommunications-complaint/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999), “judicial\n\nconstruction is neither required nor permissible.” (Emphasis added.) Further, there has\n\nsimply never been any question that, to determine whether the Legislature intended to\n\nconfer standing under a particular statute, we employ the normal rules of statutory\n\ninterpretation and proceed by “analyz[ing] the statutory language.” Miller, 481 Mich at\n\n607, 610.\n\n      Therefore, as in all cases requiring us to interpret an unambiguous statute, resort to\n\nlegislative history is inappropriate. In re Certified Question from US Court of Appeals\n\n      16\n            Ante at ___ n 26.\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\ffor Sixth Circuit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003). Further, even when\n\nreference to legislative history is appropriate, staff analyses created within the legislative\n\nbranch “are entitled to little judicial consideration” because “[i]n no way can a\n\n‘legislative analysis’ be said to officially summarize the intentions of those who have\n\nbeen designated by the Constitution to be participants in this legislative process, the\n\nmembers of the House and the Senate and the Governor.” Id.17 Indeed, the legislative\n\nanalysis cited here expressly states: “This analysis was prepared by nonpartisan Senate\n\nstaff for use by the Senate in its deliberations and does not constitute an official statement\n\nof legislative intent.” Enrolled Analysis of SB 0183, SB 0206, HB 4240 and HB 4241,\n\nJuly 21, 1999 (emphasis added).\n\n       Thus, the majority grants plaintiffs standing in direct derogation of the\n\nLegislature’s text and without any attention to the actual rights and remedies at stake,\n\nwhich include the constitutional rights of the unrepresented students. The majority’s\n\napplication of its vague new test demonstrates the test’s unprincipled nature and far-\n\nreaching consequences. This Court’s opinion in Lee was aimed precisely at avoiding\n\nsuch consequences by acknowledging that courts do not have unfettered discretion to\n\ngrant or deny standing at will, but should adhere to a common standard. A common\n\nstandard prevents the expansion of the judicial power beyond its constitutional bounds\n\n\n       17\n         Further, contrary to the majority’s characterization of such analyses, clearly the\npre-enactment statements of a legislative staffer are by no means comparable to\nstatements made by official, voting delegates to our constitutional convention, which I\nreference below.\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fwhich, in turn, protects both the rights of citizens and the separate purviews of the other\n\nbranches of government.\n\n          II. LEE WAS CORRECTLY DECIDED AND ITS ARTICULATION\n                  OF STANDING IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT\n              OF THIS STATE’S CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE\n\n       Relying on decades of developments in federal courts, the United States Supreme\n\nCourt in Lujan set forth three elements so basic to the concept of what is needed for any\n\nparty to bring a lawsuit that it labeled this standard the “irreducible constitutional\n\nminimum” of federal standing jurisprudence. 504 US at 560. First, a party wishing to\n\nbring a suit must have suffered a concrete and actual or imminent injury. Second, there\n\nmust be a fairly traceable causal connection between the injury and the defendant’s\n\nconduct. And third, a legal decision in favor of the party must be likely to redress the\n\nharm. Id. at 560-561. By nearly unanimous vote, this Court’s decision in Lee expressly\n\nincorporated this “irreducible constitutional minimum” into our state’s existing standing\n\njurisprudence, Lee, 464 Mich at 740, in an effort to identify when the courts have the\n\nauthority to exercise “[t]he judicial power of the state.” Const 1963, art 6, § 1. Because\n\nthe doctrine of standing touches every civil lawsuit brought in this state, it is a doctrine of\n\nthe utmost importance, with serious constitutional and practical implications.\n\n       Unfortunately, none of these considerations has deterred the majority in this case\n\nfrom reducing Michigan’s standing requirements from the clear, developed standards\n\narticulated in Lee and its progeny to a broad and amorphous principle that promises to be\n\nnearly impossible to apply in a society that operates under the rule of law. The majority\n\ndoes so by relying on arguments and legal theories that have been considered and rejected\n\n\n                                              32\n\fas inconsistent with Michigan’s constitutional requirements. The majority also does so\n\nnotwithstanding that Lee and its progeny provided Michigan with a clear, well-\n\nunderstood standing framework that clarified the law for the better by identifying the\n\nproper scope of judicial authority. The majority today upends and reverses this entire\n\nbody of Michigan law in vindication of the personal views of the majority justices, but to\n\nthe detriment of this state’s constitutional jurisprudence.\n\n     A. STANDING IS A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT IN MICHIGAN\n\n       The Michigan Constitution both separates the powers of the various branches of\n\ngovernment and limits the power of the judicial branch to hear cases when actual disputes\n\nexist. Thus, standing is a constitutional requirement. Because the Constitution vests\n\n“[t]he judicial power of the state . . . exclusively in one court of justice,” Const 1963, art\n\n6, § 1, the source and boundary of this power is constitutional in nature. Lee therefore\n\nproperly held that federal constitutional standards regarding standing may serve as a\n\nbenchmark in Michigan.\n\n       Perhaps the most fundamental doctrine in American political and constitutional\n\nthought is the separation of powers of government into a tripartite system. This principle\n\nhas been explicitly incorporated in Michigan’s constitutions.18          The importance of\n\ndistribution of power is reaffirmed explicitly in our current Constitution, which states:\n\n\n       18\n          See, e.g., Const 1908, art 4, § 1 (“The powers of government are divided into\nthree departments: The legislative, executive and judicial.”); id. at art 4, § 2 (“No person\nbelonging to 1 department shall exercise the powers properly belonging to another,\nexcept in the cases expressly provided in this constitution.”).\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f“The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and\n\njudicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly\n\nbelonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.”19 Const\n\n1963, art 3, § 2. There can be no doubt, then, that the scope of the judiciary’s power is\n\nboth created and constrained by Michigan’s Constitution.\n\n       The Lee Court did not newly create this constitutional principle out of whole cloth.\n\nContrary to the majority’s belief, and inconvenient to the majority’s conclusion,\n\nMichigan has consistently acknowledged that the state’s constitution limits the judicial\n\npower to hearing disputes involving actual cases or controversies. Understanding this\n\nmost basic of principles is imperative to defining what, precisely, this state’s doctrine\n\nregarding “standing” should be because there is a clear link between the doctrine of\n\nstanding and the separation of powers.

Early on, the\n       great constitutional scholar Justice THOMAS M. COOLEY discussed the\n       concept of separation of powers in the context of declining to issue a\n       mandamus against the Governor in Sutherland v Governor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n       324 (1874):\n\n              “Our government is one whose powers have been carefully\n       apportioned between three distinct departments, which emanate alike from\n       the people, have their powers alike limited and defined by the constitution,\n       are of equal dignity, and within their respective spheres of action equally\n       independent. One makes the laws, another applies the laws in contested\n       cases, while the third must see that the laws are executed. This division is\n       accepted as a necessity in all free governments, and the very apportionment\n       of power to one department is understood to be a prohibition of its exercise\n       by either of the others. The executive is forbidden to exercise judicial\n       power by the same implication which forbids the courts to take upon\n       themselves his duties.”\n\n       This position followed from the even earlier iteration of the standing\n       doctrine by Justice CAMPBELL in 1859 when, speaking for this Court, he\n       said:\n\n               “By the judicial power of courts is generally understood the power to\n        hear and determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in\n        litigation.” [Daniels v People, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388 (1859) (emphasis added).]\n\n              Later, in Risser v Hoyt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1884), this\n       Court explained:\n\n             “The judicial power referred to is the authority to hear and decide\n       controversies, and to make binding orders and judgments respecting them.”\n       [Emphasis added.]\n\n       More recently, Johnson v Kramer Bros Freight Lines, Inc, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2113904\"><a href=\"/opinion/2113904/johnson-v-kramer-bros-freight-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n       258; 98 NW2d 586 (1959), reaffirmed this concept by quoting this portion\n       of Risser.

For example, in 1920 this Court relied\n\non the separation of powers and the development of judicial power in declaring\n\nunconstitutional a statute that would have conferred standing upon citizens to invoke the\n\njurisdiction of the courts “not in the determination of actual controversies where rights\n\nhave been invaded and wrongs have been done, but in the giving of advice to all who\n\nmay seek it.” Anway v Grand Rapids R Co, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1920).\n\nThe Court explained:\n\n              This court and the court from which this case came by appeal draw\n       their power from the Constitution.

For these\n       reasons it is void in its entirety. [Id. at 622.]\n\nFollowing the decision in Anway, the Legislature amended the act to remove the\n\noffending provisions that had allowed courts to exercise powers outside of the case and\n\ncontroversy context, and this Court upheld the revised act in Washington-Detroit Theatre\n\nCo v Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1930).

As this history makes clear, Michigan has consistently acknowledged\n\nthat our state constitution limits the judicial power to hearing cases involving actual cases\n\nor controversies.\n\n       This is true notwithstanding the lack of an explicit “case or controversy”\n\nrequirement in the Michigan Constitution. Indeed, exceptions to the general “case or\n\ncontroversy” limitation on judicial power have been explicitly made in the text of our\n\nConstitution itself, thereby recognizing the rule that a case or controversy is otherwise\n\nrequired. For example, Const 1963, art 9, § 32, confers upon “any taxpayer of the state”\n\nstanding to bring suit to enforce the provisions of the Headlee Amendment. Const 1963,\n\nart 11, § 5, empowers “any citizen of the state” to bring injunctive or mandamus\n\nproceedings to enforce the civil service laws of the state. Perhaps most significantly,\n\nConst 1963, art 3, § 8, allows either house of the Legislature to request that this Court\n\nissue an advisory opinion on the “constitutionality of legislation.”\n\n       Indeed, the delegates’ discussion of this last section, when it was ratified at the\n\nConstitutional Convention, eliminates any doubt about the framers’ understanding of the\n\njudicial power in Michigan and directly confirms the Lee Court’s interpretation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\fjudicial power.20 In considering whether the Court should have the power to issue\n\nadvisory opinions in nonadversarial proceedings at the request of other branches of\n\ngovernment, the delegates’ entire discussion was clearly premised on the unquestioned\n\nassumption that the judicial power, generally, was rooted in a case or controversy\n\nrequirement. At the outset, Delegate Harold Norris explicitly asked with regard to the\n\nproposed section: “Does that mean that as far as this committee is concerned, they do not\n\nwish to preserve the traditional notion that there must be a case or controversy presented\n\nbefore the court may exercise its judicial power?” 1 Official Record, Constitutional\n\nConvention 1961, p 1544 (emphasis added). When the question was raised whether the\n\npower to issue an advisory opinion would be equivalent to the courts’ preexisting power\n\nto issue declaratory judgments, Delegate Eugene Wanger similarly specified that the\n\ncourts’ preexisting power, even in the arena of declaratory judgments, distinctly required\n\n“an actual controversy between individuals . . . .” Id. at 1545. Delegate Raymond King\n\nmay have expressed the understanding most clearly when he remarked:\n\n               We are indeed contemplating a very serious change in what I think\n       to be the history and the tradition of justice in this country. Mr. Wanger\n       has pointed out the troubles that the Massachusetts supreme court got into\n       when they allowed themselves to leave the theory of case and controversy.\n       [Id. at 1546 (emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n       20\n          It is appropriate to consult constitutional convention debates when, as here, “‘we\nfind in the debates a recurring thread of explanation binding together the whole of a\nconstitutional concept.’” Studier v Michigan Public School Employees’ Retirement Bd,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656; 698 NW2d 350, (2005), quoting Univ of Michigan Regents v\nMichigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1716768\"><a href=\"/opinion/1716768/regents-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60; 235 NW2d 1 (1975).\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\fIndeed, even with regard to the limited expansion21 of judicial power represented by the\n\nproposed advisory opinion provision, delegates were expressly concerned that it would\n\n“adversely affect[] the separation of powers doctrine . . . .” Id. at 1545 (Delegate\n\nWanger); and see id. at 1546 (Delegate Jack Faxon indicating that the convention “should\n\nbe wary of any violation of the separation of powers”); id. at 1547 (Delegate King\n\nstating: “I think we have established through the English common law and our adherence\n\nthereto a system of justice, a system of separation of powers which has proven itself, and\n\nI think we ought to be very reluctant at this time to try something new.”).\n\n       The framers’ discussion on these points reinforces the Lee Court’s understanding\n\nof the judicial power and presaged the critical problems—which I express here and which\n\nhave been expressed by my colleagues in the past—with expanding the judicial power\n\nbeyond its traditional limit. It also reinforces our conclusion, in Nat'l Wildlife that\n\n       [t]o the extent that the people of Michigan, through their constitution, have\n       chosen to confer upon the judiciary three specific authorities potentially\n       beyond the traditional “judicial power,” it seems unlikely that the people\n       intended that any other such nontraditional authority could simply be\n       incorporated as part of the “judicial power” by a simple majority of the\n       Legislature. [471 Mich at 625.]\n\n\n       21\n          The delegates agreed that the constitutional advisory opinion provision was\nunique and intended to be very limited. For example, Delegate Wanger observed: “It\nhas been emphasized by everyone supporting the advisory opinion practice that the courts\nwill exercise restraint, that they will be very careful not to answer every question that is\nasked but merely to answer those which are of a very, very vital nature.” Id. at 1548.\nDelegate Robert Danhof expressed a similar concern, advocating that the language of the\nprovision should include “an admonition to the supreme court that it is desirable that this\nparticular power be exercised very sparingly and, just as we mean, only upon the most\nsolemn occasions upon very important questions of law.” Id. at 1549.\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f       In sum, it is clear that the framers of Michigan’s constitution believed, first, that\n\nthe judicial power is generally circumscribed by the case or controversy requirement and,\n\nsecond, that the only way to expand judicial power beyond the traditional case or\n\ncontroversy limitation was through affirmative amendment of the constitution. In accord,\n\nthis Court has held that the constitutional standing test articulated in Lee must not be\n\napplied to limit judicial power otherwise expressly conferred in the Michigan\n\nConstitution. See Mich Coalition of State Employee Unions v Mich Civil Service Comm,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849112\"><a href=\"/opinion/849112/mi-coalition-of-state-empl-unions-v-civil-serv-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217-219; 634 NW2d 692 (2001).\n\n       Yet, since the decision in Lee, several members of the current majority have\n\nadvanced the view that, because the Michigan Constitution does not expressly use the\n\nwords “case” and “controversy” like the federal constitution, Michigan has no\n\nconstitutional standing requirement. This argument fundamentally misunderstands both\n\nthe Michigan and federal constitutions and misapprehends the constitutional standing\n\ntheory. In Nat'l Wildlife we explained that the provisions of the federal constitution\n\ndescribing the limited “cases” and “controversies” that federal courts have the power to\n\nhear\n\n       is not a definitional provision that seeks to give meaning to the “judicial\n       power.” Rather, art III, § 2 is a provision defining the limited judicial\n       power of the federal judiciary, in contrast to the plenary judicial power of\n       the state judiciary. The respective legislative articles of the two\n       constitutions are analogous to the judicial articles: the legislative article of\n       the Michigan Constitution does not purport to define the authority of its\n       Legislature (for example, nothing is said therein concerning its authority\n       over marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, alimony, or foster\n       care), while the legislative article of the federal constitution does\n       affirmatively confer authority upon the Congress, article I, § 8. The state\n       judicial power, as with the state legislative power, is plenary, requiring no\n\n\n                                             41\n\f      affirmative grant of authority in the state Constitution. The federal judicial\n      power, on the other hand, as with the federal legislative power, is limited.\n      Such power is exclusively a function, or a creation, of the federal\n      constitution, and, therefore, must be affirmatively set forth. In similar\n      fashion, the federal judicial power must also be affirmatively set forth, for it\n      is also a function, or creation, of the federal constitution. Thus, U.S.\n      Const., art. III, § 2 does not define the “judicial power;” rather it defines\n      what part of the “judicial power” within the United States belongs to the\n      federal judiciary, with the remaining part belonging exclusively to the state\n      judiciary. That art. III, § 2 variously employs the terms “cases” or\n      “controversies” is not to confer a particular meaning upon the “judicial\n      power,” but merely is to employ words that are necessary to the syntax of\n      allocating the “judicial power” between the federal and state governments.\n      The concurrence/dissents would confuse the allocation of a power with its\n      definition, and would thereby define the federal “judicial power” in the\n      narrowest possible manner by limiting it through reference alone to the\n      existence of a “case.” Even from the perspective of the\n      concurrence/dissents, is there no more permanent aspect of the “judicial\n      power” than that it pertain to a “case”?\n\n             In fact, the “judicial power” in the Michigan Constitution, with the\n      several exceptions enumerated [explicitly in the Constitution], is the same\n      “judicial power” as in the federal constitution, and it is the same “judicial\n      power” that has informed the practice of both federal and state judiciaries\n      for centuries. These historical principles were recognized by Lee, and we\n      continue to adhere to them today. [Nat'l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 626-628.22]\n\n      22\n         In Nestlé Waters, we further rejected this argument when a party argued that the\nLegislature had conferred statutory standing on it, which should be sufficient even if the\nparty could not meet the basic strictures of constitutional standing. We stated:\n\n             Justice WEAVER persists in her argument that the textual differences\n      between the federal constitution and our state constitution prove that the\n      exercise of “judicial power” or the doctrine of separation of powers in our\n      constitution means something radically different than it does under the\n      federal constitution. This argument that separation of powers should be\n      understood differently in the Michigan Constitution because the words\n      “case” and “controversy” are not in our constitution suggests to us that\n      Justice WEAVER fundamentally misunderstands the doctrine of separation\n      of powers. She refuses to accept that there is a constitutional limit on the\n      Legislature’s authority to expand “judicial power” in the area of standing.\n      In response, we stated in Nat'l Wildlife that “[a]s the Michigan Constitution\n\n\n                                            42\n\fYet this argument that Michigan does not have a constitutional basis for its standing\n\ntest—based on “caricatured textualism” that has been handily rejected—persists\n\nnonetheless.23   In particular, Justice WEAVER has championed this dubious theory,\n\n\n       makes clear, the duty of the judiciary is to exercise the ‘judicial power,’\n       and, in so doing, to respect the separation of powers. While as a general\n       proposition, the proper exercise of the ‘judicial power’ will obligate the\n       judiciary to give faithful effect to the words of the Legislature—for it is the\n       latter that exercises the ‘legislative power,’ not the judiciary—such effect\n       cannot properly be given when to do so would contravene the constitution\n       itself. Just as the judicial branch owes deference to the legislative branch\n       when the ‘legislative power’ is being exercised, so too does the legislative\n       branch owe deference to the judicial branch when the exercise of the\n       ‘judicial power’ is implicated. Even with the acquiescence of the\n       legislative and executive branches, the judicial branch cannot arrogate to\n       itself governmental authority that is beyond the scope of the ‘judicial\n       power’ under the constitution. The ‘textual’ approach of [Justice WEAVER]\n       is a caricatured textualism, in which the Legislature is empowered to act\n       beyond its authority in conferring powers upon other branches that are also\n       beyond their authority.” [Nat'l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 637 (citations omitted;\n       emphasis in original).] [Nestlé Waters, 479 Mich at 307-308.]\n       23\n           The majority cites Washington-Detroit Theatre Co, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, for the\nproposition that “this Court long ago explained that Michigan courts’ judicial power to\ndecide controversies was broader than the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation\nof the Article III case-or-controversy limits on the federal judicial power because a state\nsovereign possesses inherent powers that the federal government does not.” This is\nprecisely correct, but not in the way the majority applies it. In fact, it actually\nundermines the majority’s conclusion. The majority here either fails to understand or\nwillfully ignores the fact that the federal “case or controversy” requirement limits only\nthe range of controversies that may be heard in federal courts, and that this is distinct\nfrom the requirement that an actual case or controversy exists in the first place. In short,\nthat Michigan courts may decide types of controversies that the federal courts lack\nauthority to decide does not mean that Michigan has no constitutional threshold for when\na plaintiff may bring such a controversy. The Lee/Lujan standing test does not govern\nwhat types of cases/controversies may be brought, only whether a case/controversy exists\nin the first instance.\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\fwhich—given Chief Justice KELLY’s and Justice CAVANAGH’s recent metamorphoses on\n\nthe issue of standing, and Justice HATHAWAY’s election to the Court—presents a\n\nconvenient argument as the majority grasps at straws to explain why Lee and its progeny\n\nshould be overruled. The fact remains that in neither the majority opinion in this case,\n\nnor any of the majority justices’ concurring or dissenting opinions in prior cases, has a\n\nmember of the majority ever articulated a sufficient response to these serious criticisms.\n\nThis case has greater significance than prior cases, however, because the majority\n\nproceeds on these false understandings in order to remove altogether the limits imposed\n\nby our Constitution.\n\n       The proposition that Michigan courts are limited by an actual case or controversy\n\nrequirement is beyond reproach. Michigan’s case or controversy requirement is not\n\ndrawn from the federal “case or controversy” language, but rather the parallel limitations\n\nimposed in Michigan’s own constitution. This fact has been recognized by more than a\n\ncentury worth of Michigan caselaw, and thus it formed the basis for this Court’s decision\n\nin Lee to incorporate a standing test that reflected this reality. The majority’s author need\n\nonly read his own opinions to realize as much. For example, in People v Richmond, this\n\nCourt recently reaffirmed that “it is the ‘principal duty of this Court . . . to decide actual\n\ncases and controversies.’ That is, ‘“[t]he judicial power . . . is the right to determine\n\nactual controversies arising between adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper\n\njurisdiction.”’”   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"831445\"><a href=\"/opinion/831445/people-v-richmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34; 782 NW2d 187 (2010) (majority opinion by\n\nCAVANAGH, J.)

If not, the majority is left\n\n\n       24\n           In Richmond, three members of the current majority held that the prosecutor’s\ncase was moot, and therefore did not present an actual case and controversy, although the\nprosecutor had an interest in appealing the trial court’s adverse evidentiary rulings before\nvoluntarily dismissing the charges. Here, plaintiffs have no recognized interest separate\nfrom that of the general public, and no private right of action to vindicate. Thus,\nironically, the majority is content to block certain parties from proceeding based on “case\nand controversy” grounds, while allowing other parties to proceed although they have no\nlegal interests. I can discern no pattern or method other than that the majority wishes to\nuse these cases as vehicles to overturn precedents with which it disagrees, or that it seeks\nto assist certain parties in achieving their political ends. Neither, of course, is legitimate.\n       25\n            As this Court explained in Michigan Chiropractic Council:\n\n              In seeking to make certain that the judiciary does not usurp the\n       power of coordinate branches of government, and exercises only ‘judicial\n       power,’ both this Court and the federal courts have developed justiciability\n       doctrines to ensure that cases before the courts are appropriate for judicial\n       action. These include the doctrines of standing, ripeness, and mootness.\n\n               Federal courts have held that doctrines such as standing and\n       mootness are constitutionally derived and jurisdictional in nature, because\n       failure to satisfy their elements implicates the court’s constitutional\n       authority to exercise only ‘judicial power’ and adjudicate only actual cases\n       or controversies. . . . Likewise, our case law has also viewed the doctrines\n       of justiciability as affecting ‘judicial power,’ the absence of which renders\n       the judiciary constitutionally powerless to adjudicate the claim. . . .\n\n                                               * * *\n\n              Thus, we reiterate that questions of justiciability concern the\n       judiciary’s constitutional jurisdiction to adjudicate cases containing a\n       genuine controversy. [475 Mich at 370-374 (emphasis in original).]\n\n\n                                              45\n\fin the intellectually inconsistent position of defending those bodies of case law, which\n\nhave the same constitutional foundation regarding justiciability as the standing principles\n\narticulated in Lujan and Lee. Indeed, these doctrines are based exclusively on the very\n\ncase or controversy requirement, implicit in the Michigan Constitution, that the majority\n\nhere rejects.\n\n       Like this Court in Lee, other courts have rejected the majority’s imprecise and\n\noverly broad analysis regarding the constitutional basis for standing on similar grounds.\n\nFor example, in Bennett v Napolitano, the Arizona Supreme Court recently stated:\n\n              Article VI of the Arizona Constitution, the judicial article, does not\n       contain the specific case or controversy requirement of the U.S.\n       Constitution. But, unlike the federal constitution in which the separation of\n       powers principle is implicit, our state constitution contains an express\n       mandate, requiring that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of\n       government be divided among the three branches and exercised separately.\n       This mandate underlies our own requirement that as a matter of sound\n       jurisprudence a litigant seeking relief in the Arizona courts must first\n       establish standing to sue. [206 Ariz 520, 525; 81 P3d 311 (2003).]\n\nThe majority’s flawed constitutional analysis allows it to advance the false dichotomy\n\nthat this state’s standing jurisprudence must be based either on prudential concerns or on\n\nconstitutional underpinnings, but not both. As the above analysis demonstrates, however,\n\nthe constitutional separation of powers constraints explicitly provided in Michigan’s\n\nConstitution give rise to minimal constitutional standing requirements, which this Court\n\nmay augment when additional, prudential concerns arise.26 Thus, the interpretation of\n\n\n       26\n         Cf.

LEE AND ITS PROGENY:\n            CREATING CERTAINTY IN MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE\n\n       Although the concept of “standing” touches every civil action filed in this state,\n\nprior to the adoption of the Lujan standard in Michigan this Court had only produced a\n\ngeneral description of the principles governing standing. The most recent description that\n\ngarnered support from a majority of this Court is found in House Speaker v State Admin\n\nBd,27 which stated:\n\n              Standing is a legal term used to denote the existence of a party’s\n       interest in the outcome of litigation that will ensure sincere and vigorous\n       advocacy. However, evidence that a party will engage in full and vigorous\n       advocacy, by itself, is insufficient to establish standing. Standing requires a\n       demonstration that the plaintiff’s substantial interest will be detrimentally\n       affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large. [441 Mich at\n       554.]\n\nUnsurprisingly, such a general proposition for a doctrine as important and far-reaching as\n\nstanding proved difficult to apply. This fact became all too obvious in Detroit Fire\n\nFighters, when this Court next examined Michigan’s standing doctrine. Detroit Fire\n\nFighters resulted in a split decision in which no majority could be found to explain what\n\nexplicit theory, about the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an\nunelected, unrepresentative judiciary in our kind of government.’” Quoting Allen, 468\nUS at 750, quoting Vander Jagt v O’Neill, 226 US App DC 14, 26-27; 699 F2d 1166\n[1983] (Bork, J., concurring)).\n       27\n          House Speaker was decided by this Court before the United States Supreme\nCourt released its opinion in Lujan.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\felements were essential to standing in Michigan.28 Indeed, although all four opinions\n\ncited the same boilerplate language from House Speaker in support of their respective\n\npositions, the justices did not agree on such fundamental questions as what standing is in\n\nMichigan, what test should govern standing, and whether the plaintiffs had standing in\n\nthat particular case.29 This hodgepodge of disparate opinions compelled the Court to\n\nreach the merits of the case without a clear consensus on the threshold question whether\n\nthe plaintiffs even had standing to bring the case.\n\n       This background formed the context in which this Court again confronted this\n\nstate’s standing principles in Lee where, by a vote of six to one, this Court adopted and\n\nincorporated Lujan into our standing jurisprudence. As we stated then:\n\n               In our view, the Lujan test has the virtues of articulating clear\n       criteria and of establishing the burden of demonstrating these elements.\n       Moreover, its three elements appear to us to be fundamental to standing; the\n       United States Supreme Court described them as establishing the\n       “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing. We agree. [Lee, 464\n       Mich at 740.]\n\nConsistent with this Court’s constitutional obligations, the nearly unanimous majority in\n\nLee correctly noted that the Lujan test provides a practical and workable framework for\n       28\n         </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1281120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1281120/detroit-fire-fighters-assn-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, opinions by WEAVER, J.

Perhaps the clearest\ntemplate was set forward by Justice CAVANAGH, who, along with Justice BOYLE,\nadvocated adopting the United States Supreme Court’s Lujan test.” Lee, 464 Mich at\n739.\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\faddressing what was previously an amorphous and often difficult concept. In its most\n\nbasic form, the doctrine of standing can be properly reduced to the Lujan factors. What is\n\nstanding if not the requirement that a plaintiff either has suffered or is in imminent danger\n\nof suffering an actual harm, that the harm is allegedly caused by the defendant, and that\n\nthe result of the court’s action can redress the wrong or injury? While the federal and\n\nstate constitutions are not coterminous, they have developed on a parallel track, and the\n\ninterpretation of federal constitutional law may inform state constitutional law when they\n\nshare common elements. Although the majority has littered its opinion with instinctive\n\nrepetitions that this state’s standing jurisprudence is “prudential,” the majority cannot\n\nexplain what is imprudent about the “irreducible” and traditional description of the\n\nstanding doctrine articulated in Lujan.\n\n       By introducing an objective framework based on three well-developed and readily\n\nunderstandable criteria—injury in fact, causation, and redressability—the Lee decision\n\nsimplified and made more practical the doctrine of standing in this state. As is evidenced\n\nby how justices on this Court could not previously agree about what, exactly, standing\n\nmeant in Michigan under House Speaker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1955973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1955973/house-speaker-v-governor/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Lee framework provides\n\ncertainty. The progeny of Lee bear this out: in a decade’s worth of cases, Michigan trial\n\nand appellate courts have consistently and appropriately applied Michigan’s standing\n\ndoctrine.30   Indeed, during this time the doctrine itself has not changed.        Only the\n\n\n       30\n          See Lee, 464 Mich at 739-740 (incorporating the federal standing analysis\narticulated in Lujan into Michigan standing jurisprudence); Nat’l Wildlife, 471 Mich at\n628-629 (organizational standing and legislative authority to grant citizen standing);\n\n\n                                             49\n\fpersonal views of justices on this Court—and only those who now overrule a decade’s\n\nworth of cases—have changed.\n\n       As a matter of simple prudence and proper exercise of this Court’s constitutional\n\nauthority, this Court is empowered to create clear rules that are easily accessible and\n\napplicable in the future. Aside from ensuring that Michigan courts only hear genuine\n\ncases and controversies in accord with its constitutionally mandated judicial powers,\n\nadopting the well-defined Lujan test provides the additional benefit of ensuring that\n\nMichigan’s standing doctrine is guided by clearly articulated and well-developed rules.\n\nA well-understood and practical standing test serves to uphold the separation of powers\n\nand promote the sound administration of justice. Indeed, only such a framework can\n\nensure that courts will be governed by the rule of law, which itself ensures equality of\n\ntreatment under the law. Inexplicably, the majority apparently celebrates that, prior to\n\nLee, Michigan’s standing doctrine suffered from inconsistent application, and in some\n\ncases, was not analyzed or applied at all.31 Unfortunately, the majority’s test can promise\n\nno better in the future; this is particularly true since, by its explicit terms, standing can\n\nnow be determined at the “discretion” of trial courts.\n\n\n\n\nNestlé Waters, 479 Mich at 295-296, 302-303 (legislative authority to grant citizen\nstanding); Rohde, 479 Mich at 354-355, (taxpayer and qui tam standing); Michigan\nChiropractic, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"845820\"><a href=\"/opinion/845820/mich-chiropractic-council-and-soc-v-comr-of-off-of-fin-ins-serv/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Associated Builders & Contractors, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848662\"><a href=\"/opinion/848662/associated-builders-and-contractors-v-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (standing\nnecessary in order to seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to MCR 2.605).\n       31\n            Ante, ___ n 3.\n\n\n\n                                             50\n\f       Notably, Lee did not supplant or “sacrifice” this Court’s standing jurisprudence, as\n\nthe majority in this case erroneously states.

Indeed, with this case, the majority overrules those principles and\n\nrules that ensured that the doctrine would have articulated and meaningful limits in\n\nMichigan. Writing for the Court in Nat’l Wildlife, Justice MARKMAN foreshadowed the\n\nunfortunate turn of events altering Michigan’s standing jurisprudence that today has\n\ncome to pass:\n\n             By their diminishment of a traditional check and balance upon the\n      exercise of the ‘judicial power,’ the concurring/dissenting Justices\n      [CAVANAGH, KELLY, and WEAVER] would, if their position were ever to\n      gain a majority, inflict considerable injury upon our system of separation of\n      powers and the rule of law that it has produced. [Nat’l Wildlife, 471 Mich\n      at 628.]\n\nJustice HATHAWAY has now provided those justices with their fourth vote, and with it\n\nsurely will come the inevitable breakdown of the rule of law in the domain of standing\n\nthat only Lee and its progeny had stood athwart.\n\n\n      33\n           See, generally, Nat'l Wildlife, 471 Mich at 617-623.\n\n\n\n                                             54\n\f            III. THE MAJORITY’S SELF-SERVING AND INCONSISTENT\n                 APPROACH TO THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS\n\n       Finally, the far-reaching, deleterious impact of the majority’s decision in this case\n\nis equally inherent in its methods for overruling significant, precedential opinions of this\n\nCourt. The majority’s claim that it has good reason to overrule Lee and its progeny, in\n\ncontravention of the doctrine of stare decisis, is bankrupt and self-serving.         Most\n\nsignificantly, in jettisoning Lee, the four justices constituting the majority fail to apply\n\nany agreed-upon test to examine whether this change in law is justified. The only clear\n\ncommonality is their shared conclusion that Lee was clearly wrongly decided. This\n\nconclusion is mystifying because it is directly counter to the past positions of three\n\nmembers of the current majority, who supported Lee—and the case or controversy\n\nrequirement underpinning Lee—in previous cases. Finally, the majority’s determination\n\nthat overruling Lee will benefit the public depends entirely on circular, self-serving\n\nreasoning; the majority simply concludes that its preferred regime would better serve the\n\npublic without any attention to the actual desires of the Michigan public—as expressed,\n\nfor example, in the Michigan Constitution—or to the commonplace conclusion of courts\n\nthroughout the nation that the test articulated in Lujan well serves the nation’s courts and\n\ncitizens.\n\n                A. THE MAJORITY’S STANDARDLESS APPROACH\n                        TO OVERRULING PRECEDENT\n\n       In Robinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), this Court\n\narticulated several factors for consideration before a court should overrule established\n\nprecedent. “The first question, of course, should be whether the earlier decision was\n\n\n                                            55\n\fwrongly decided.” Id. at 464. But “the mere fact that an earlier case was wrongly\n\ndecided does not mean overruling it is invariably appropriate.” Id. at 465. Rather,\n\n“[c]ourts should also review whether the decision at issue defies ‘practical workability,’\n\nwhether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law\n\nor facts no longer justify the questioned decision.” Id. at 464.\n\n       The majority’s conclusion that Lee was wrongly decided is untenable. The test\n\nLee enunciated is loyal to the Michigan Constitution, is consistent with our jurisprudence,\n\nand has been adopted and successfully applied throughout the nation by states with\n\nconstitutions similar to our own. Next, there is no indication that the Lee test “defies\n\n‘practical workability,’” that “reliance interests would work an undue hardship,” or that\n\n“changes in the law or facts no longer justify” it. Robinson, 462 Mich at 464. To the\n\ncontrary, in standardizing factors for standing throughout the state based on the well-\n\nestablished and accepted federal test, Lee created a predictable analytic tool. It thus\n\nenhanced workability for courts and parties and protected parties’ interests from\n\npotentially unanticipated discretionary decisions of individual courts, which did not have\n\nthe benefit of concrete, guiding principles before Lee.\n\n       In jettisoning this Court’s constitutional standing jurisprudence, however, Justice\n\nCAVANAGH chooses not to rely on the Robinson factors. Instead, he cites Chief Justice\n\nKELLY’s analysis in Petersen v Magna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 773 NW2d 564 (2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                             56\n\fThere, the Chief Justice expressed her disapproval of Robinson.34 Petersen, 484 Mich at\n\n316-317. She thus articulated her own preferred standard, albeit while “neglect[ing] even\n\nto apply her new stare decisis standard to determine whether Robinson itself should be\n\noverruled.”   Id. at 388 n 42 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting).       Only Justice CAVANAGH\n\nconcurred in the Chief Justice’s stare decisis analysis in Petersen, and only the Chief\n\nJustice expressly joins Justice CAVANAGH’s reliance on Petersen here.\n\n      In declining to join Justice CAVANAGH’s discussion of stare decisis, Justices\n\nWEAVER and HATHAWAY go one step further. In their concurrences, they expressly\n\nadvocate no standardized approach to overruling precedent. Concluding that “[t]here is\n\nno need for this Court to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis,” Justice\n\nWEAVER advocates for a “case-by-case” analysis based on undefined notions of “judicial\n\nrestraint, common sense, and fairness.” Her application of these notions to this case\n\nexemplifies the unprincipled nature of her position. She simply advances the empty,\n\ncircular conclusion: “In serving the rule of law and applying judicial restraint, common\n\nsense, and a sense of fairness to the case at hand, I agree with and join the majority\n\nopinion’s holding that Lee and its progeny are overruled.” Justice HATHAWAY describes\n\na judge’s duty when deciding whether to overrule precedent as a “policy determination”\n\nthat “will be dependent upon the facts and circumstances presented.”        Like Justice\n\n      34\n          Notably, Chief Justice KELLY concluded that “Robinson is insufficiently\nrespectful of precedent” and indicated that she “would modify it by shifting the balance\nback in favor of precedent.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 316-317. This allegiance to\nprecedent is remarkably absent in this case despite the majority’s reliance on Chief\nJustice KELLY’s Petersen formulation.\n\n\n\n                                           57\n\fWEAVER, she votes to overrule Lee based on an empty, unexplained conclusion: “the\n\nreasons for overruling Lee are paramount to any articulated test and the special and\n\ncompelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case.”\n\n      Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY have each espoused their troubling views that\n\nreviewing whether a case should be overruled is merely a “policy” determination that\n\nneed not be guided by any standard in several other recent cases, including Univ of\n\nMichigan Regents v Titan Ins Co, ___ Mich ___; ___ NW2d ___ (2010), and\n\nMcCormick, ___ Mich ___. Their professed approaches rely entirely on their personal,\n\nsubjective views of the law. As Justice YOUNG noted in his dissent to Univ of Mich\n\nRegents, their approaches are “the very antithesis of the ‘rule of law.’” ___ Mich at ___\n\n(YOUNG, J., dissenting). He observed:\n\n              The rule of law, by definition, requires judges to decide cases on the\n      basis of principles, announced in advance, rather than on a personal or\n      subjective preference for or against a party before them. This ensures\n      stability in the law despite the diversity of judges’ personal beliefs.\n      Whether we, as judges, “like” the outcome is, quite simply, irrelevant to\n      whether it reflects a correct conclusion of law. It is harrowing that Justices\n      WEAVER and HATHAWAY either do not understand this concept or refuse to\n      subscribe to it, preferring to base their decisions on subjective “policy\n      consideration[s].” [Id. at ___.]\n\nJustice MARKMAN also warned that the primary problem with this approach is that\n\n      “litigants will, of course, have no notice beforehand of which [‘analytical\n      approach’] will be employed, for the justices themselves will not know this\n      beforehand.” Under the concurring justices’ “analytical approaches,”\n\n      “there [would be] no consistently applied . . . process with which the judge\n      promises beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be “fair,” and\n      he or she may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is\n      to be achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each\n      [precedent] on a case-by-case basis, using whatever [‘policy\n\n\n                                            58\n\f        considerations’] he or she believes are required in that instance. And the\n        suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate\n        [‘policy considerations’] may be largely a function of the outcome\n        preferred by the judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the\n        parties and their causes.” [Id. (MARKMAN, J., dissenting), quoting\n        Petersen, 484 Mich at 381-382 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting).]\nThese warnings have come full circle in this case where the majority overrules an entire\n\nbody of law without relying on any agreed-upon factors to decide whether overruling\n\nprecedent is appropriate.\n\n                     B. AFTER SUPPORTING LEE IN THE PAST,\n                 THE MAJORITY NOW INEXPLICABLY CONCLUDES\n                        THAT IT WAS WRONGLY DECIDED\n\n        Significantly, the majority’s decision to overrule Lee under the various\n\n“standards” espoused individually by each justice depends, of course, on its threshold\n\nconclusion that Lee was wrongly decided. But this conclusion itself is belied by the\n\nreliance of Chief Justice KELLY, Justice WEAVER and Justice CAVANAGH on the wisdom\n\nof Lee.      Chief Justice KELLY and Justice CAVANAGH expressly joined the Court’s\n\nadoption of the Lujan test in Lee.      Lee, 464 Mich at 750 (KELLY, J., joined by\n\nCAVANAGH, J., dissenting but “agree[ing] with the majority’s adoption of the Lujan\n\ntest”).35    Indeed, Justice CAVANAGH was the first justice of this Court to propose\n\nadopting the Lujan test; he expressly employed and advocated for adoption of the Lujan\n\ntest in concluding that the plaintiffs had standing in the fractured Detroit Fire Fighters\n\ndecision. See 449 Mich at 651-652 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting in part). Justice WEAVER\n\n\n        35\n        See also Crawford, 466 Mich 256-257 (per curiam opinion relying on Lee in\nwhich CAVANAGH, J., concurred).\n\n\n\n                                           59\n\fherself accepted Lee in Associated Builders, 472 Mich at 127 & n 16, where she\n\nexplicitly held that Lee governs standing in declaratory actions and in cases where a\n\nplaintiff seeks to enforce an alleged statutory right but the statute does not confer\n\nstanding by its own terms. These justices have also explicitly affirmed their agreement\n\nwith the concept that the judicial power in Michigan is bounded by a case or controversy\n\nrequirement. E.g. Richmond, ___ Mich at ___ (CAVANAGH, J., joined by KELLY, CJ.,\n\nMARKMAN and HATHAWAY, JJ.); (‘“[t]he judicial power . . . is the right to determine\n\nactual controversies arising between adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper\n\njurisdiction”’”) (citations omitted; ellipsis and brackets in original); In re Certified\n\nQuestion from the United States Dist Court for Eastern Dist of Michigan, 622 NW2d\n\n518, 519 (2001) (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (“‘ [J]udicial power’” is “‘the power to hear\n\nand determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in litigation.’”)\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n      In light of these justices’ former positions, I am mystified at their current\n\nconclusions that Lee was not only wrongly decided, but was so misguided that we should\n\nnow throw Michigan’s standing jurisprudence into turmoil in order to overrule Lee.\n\nIndeed, their result has every appearance of a mere power grab intended to ascribe broad,\n\nunconstitutional authority to the Court as it is now configured with this new majority at\n\nthe helm. Ironically, Justice WEAVER’s dissenting comments in In re Certified Question\n\nfrom Fourteenth Dist Court of Appeals of Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"842341\"><a href=\"/opinion/842341/in-re-certified-question-from-14th-dist-court-of-appeals-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 740 NW2d 206 (2007),\n\nare apropos. There, she reiterated her lack of support for MCR 7.305(B), which permits\n\nthis Court to entertain requests for advisory opinions from foreign courts, because the\n\n\n                                            60\n\fsubrule “lacks any limiting language on when the Court may answer a certified\n\nquestion . . . .” Id. at 550 (WEAVER, J., dissenting). A lack of express limits, she opined,\n\n“leav[es] the door and the docket open to the whims of the majority.” Id.\n\n       As if to illustrate her point, the majority underpins its supposed consideration of\n\nthe doctrine of stare decisis with its conclusion that our constitutional standing doctrine is\n\n“at the expense of the public interest . . . because it may prevent litigants from enforcing\n\npublic rights, despite the presence of adverse interests and parties, and regardless of\n\nwhether the Legislature intended a private right of enforcement to be part of the statute’s\n\nenforcement scheme.”       But this self-serving, rhetorical formulation of the “public\n\ninterest” is entirely of the majority’s own making.36 It ignores that, in this case, there is\n\nno indication that the Legislature intended that plaintiffs have a private right to enforce\n\nthe statute at issue. Most significantly, it ignores the public’s interest as expressed in our\n\nconstitution, and explained in depth above, in courts that do not have unlimited power\n\nand, absent exceptions expressly provided by the constitution, should not exceed the\n\ntraditional judicial power by intruding on the powers of the executive and legislative\n\nbranches.\n\n\n       36\n          The majority argues that, in federal courts and the dozens of states who use the\nLujan framework, those entities’ respective constitutions cause serious detriment to the\npublic interest. This alarmist reasoning provides no support for overruling Lee. Indeed,\nthis whole argument underscores the manipulative nature of the majority’s stare decisis\ntest, which here is used to displace a widely accepted and commonly used national\nstandard. More disruptive to the public interest is the state of law to which the majority\nreturns Michigan today: no defined standards, thus allowing litigious individuals to bring\nunfounded lawsuits against fellow citizens.\n\n\n\n                                             61\n\f            C. MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE IN TURMOIL:\n THE MAJORITY’S INCREASING WILLINGNESS TO OVERRULE PRECEDENT\n                    WITH WHICH IT DISAGREES\n\n       Thus the majority continues to exhibit its absolute disregard for precedent\n\ninconvenient to its aims without regard to the consequences. As Justice MARKMAN\n\nemphasized in his dissent to the majority opinion in McCormick, ___ Mich at ___:\n\n              Even a cursory analysis of the majority’s treatment of precedent\n       since it ascended to power in January 2009 reveals a lack of sufficient\n       regard for recent precedents that is directly contrary to their own previous\n       assertions of the need not to needlessly overrule cases on account of stare\n       decisis. Past complaints on their part that cases should not be overruled\n       when the only thing that has changed is the membership of the Court have\n       gone by the wayside.\n\n“[A]ll the justices who comprise the majority . . . should more clearly recognize the\n\nconsequences of what they are doing.”          Id. at ___ (emphasis omitted).       Indeed, in\n\noverruling numerous significant cases of this Court—the growing list of which is\n\ncatalogued in McCormick by Justice MARKMAN, id. at ___—in the brief period since the\n\ncurrent majority came to power in January 2009, I find the majority’s feigned adherence\n\nto the doctrine of stare decisis here hard to swallow. Nothing about the majority’s\n\ndecision today “‘promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of\n\nlegal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decision, [or] contributes to the actual and\n\nperceived integrity of the judicial process.’” See ante at ___, quoting Payne v Tennessee,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rather, the majority throws\n\ninto turmoil a well-accepted and constitutionally sound standing doctrine applicable to\n\nevery civil suit filed in this state that this Court adopted to rectify the total uncertainty in\n\nthis area that was evident in cases such as Detroit Fire Fighters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1281120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1281120/detroit-fire-fighters-assn-v-city-of-detroit/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n                                              62\n\fAccordingly, I am nonplussed by Justice CAVANAGH’s ironic lip service to Alexander\n\nHamilton’s warning that, “to ‘“avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is\n\nindispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which\n\nserve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before\n\nthem . . . .”’” Ante at ___, quoting Petersen, 484 Mich at 314-315 (opinion by KELLY,\n\nJ.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed,\n\n1961).\n\n         Finally, as Justice MARKMAN has also illustrated, this case presents yet another\n\ntroubling element of the majority’s current unbounded disregard for precedent. Here as\n\nin several other recent cases, see McCormick, ___ Mich at ___, instead of accepting the\n\nissues as framed and argued by the parties throughout the case, the majority instead\n\ndirected the parties to brief whether a decision by the former majority should be\n\noverruled. Yet, as noted, the parties to this case have always argued that Lee governs\n\ntheir dispute.   Even plaintiffs—for whom the majority renders a favorable decision\n\nhere—never challenged the correctness and applicability of Lee to their case. Further,\n\nalthough other groups and members of the public have participated in this case by filing\n\nbriefs amicus curiae at the majority’s invitation, not a single brief supports plaintiffs’\n\nargument that they have standing here.37\n\n\n         37\n           Indeed, of the amici who responded to the majority’s request to file briefs\nanalyzing the correctness of Lee, only one questioned Lee and the cases following it: the\nNational Wildlife Federation (NWF), which was the successful plaintiff in Nat’l Wildlife,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848681\"><a href=\"/opinion/848681/nat-wildlife-fed-v-cleveland-cliffs-iron-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which applied Lee. Most notably, even the NWF does not argue that\nplaintiffs have standing here.

FURTHER RESPONSE TO THE MAJORITY\n\n       Rather than ash, the majority’s stare decisis analysis should taste like bile in their\n\nmouths: like a bulimic after a three day bender, the majority justices now purge a\n\ndecade’s worth of vigorous protestations that they are committed to the principle of stare\n\ndecisis. As Justice YOUNG demonstrates at length in Univ of Mich Regents, ___ Mich at\n\n___ (YOUNG, J., dissenting), members of the majority stridently defended stare decisis for\n\nmany years when past cases supported their dissenting positions.

By reversing the line of post-Lee cases here, the majority\n\nclaims that it “brings this Court back to the status quo ante.” Unfortunately, the pre-Lee\n\nstatus quo resulting from House Speaker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1955973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1955973/house-speaker-v-governor/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, was confusion and bitter\n\ndivision regarding rules that provided no clear guidance regarding Michigan’s\n\n\n\n\nexpressly grants a plaintiff standing in a statute, the courts should permit the suit without\nregard to whether the plaintiff also qualifies for standing under the Lee/Lujan test.\n\n\n\n                                             64\n\fconstitutional standing requirements.38 It is this state to which the majority returns\n\nMichigan law. Lee did not sacrifice Michigan standing jurisprudence, as the majority\n\npersists in repeating, nor did Lee conclude that federal standing jurisprudence was\n\nexpressly binding in Michigan. Rather, Lee favored the commonly-accepted federal test\n\nwhich brought consistency to Michigan courts in light of our lack of a clearly articulated,\n\nworkable test. Further, as members of the majority have recognized, there simply is no\n\nconstitutional “conflict” that would prevent Michigan’s continued use of the Lujan/Lee\n\ntest for standing.39 These truths—as well as the overall reasonableness of the Lee test—\n\nare evident in the near-unanimous acceptance of the test in Lee itself. How is it possible\n\nthat the majority now rejects the very test suggested by Justice CAVANAGH himself in\n\nDetroit Fire Fighters, accusing the Lee Court of adopting a test that “casually displaced\n\ndecades of inconsistent precedent,” “is likely to result in serious detriment to the public\n\ninterest,” and is “contrary” to Michigan law? As Justice YOUNG has observed in a\n\n\n\n\n      38\n          The majority persists in suggesting that Michigan had a clear, workable standing\ndoctrine for “decades” before Lee was decided. To the contrary, our 1993 decision in\nHouse Speaker, where the Court was apparently unable to make sense of Michigan’s\nhistorical approach to standing, left our standing doctrine muddled and impossible to\napply with any consistency.\n      39\n           The majority’s unexplained suggestion that, in Michigan, “controversy” means\nsomething different than throughout the rest of the nation is without basis. As I explain\nabove, the federal “case or controversy” requirement limits only the range of\ncontroversies that may be heard in federal courts, and this is distinct from the\nrequirement—common to federal and state law alike—that an actual case or controversy\nexists in the first place.\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\fsimilar context,40 United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have best\n\ndescribed our concerns about the majority’s recent about-face with regard to stare decisis\n\nas well as its new approach to standing with the following observation:\n\n              Evidently, the governing standard is to be what might be called the\n       unfettered wisdom of a majority of this Court, revealed to an obedient\n       people on a case-by-case basis. This is not only not the government of laws\n       that the Constitution established; it is not a government of laws at all.\n       [Morrison v Olson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112139\"><a href=\"/opinion/112139/morrison-v-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112139\"><a href=\"/opinion/112139/morrison-v-olson/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The lower courts had little trouble\n\nagreeing, in relatively brief decisions, that plaintiffs do not have standing under the\n\nprinciples enunciated in Lee. But the majority’s approach so obscures the reasons courts\n\nimpose standing requirements in the first place that it leaves the dissent in a position akin\n\nto one who must “prove a negative”; thus, I attempt to show why the lower courts’\n\nconclusions that plaintiffs clearly could not proceed are indisputably correct under the\n\nterms of the statute invoked by plaintiffs to establish standing. Indeed, in light of the\n\nexpress terms of the school code, its enforcement procedures, and its disciplinary\n\nprovisions, I am baffled by the majority’s conclusion, under its own new discretionary\n\napproach, that the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that plaintiffs could not\n\nproceed here.       How is the majority’s new non-test for standing anything but a\n\n\n       40\n            Univ of Mich Regents, ___ Mich at ___ (YOUNG, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                             66\n\fproclamation that it will decide, on the basis of personal policy considerations, whether a\n\nplaintiff may maintain a suit against a particular defendant?\n\n       The majority essentially concludes that plaintiffs have standing because their\n\nsafety might have been one aim of MCL 380.1311a(1) without any regard to the\n\nLegislature’s actual intent or to the ramifications of this suit. For example, although no\n\none in this suit represents students’ rights—and thus no one may consider their rights as\n\nthe suit proceeds or in an eventual settlement—the majority presumes that the right result\n\nwill simply come out in the wash after the complaint is authorized on standing grounds.\n\nIndeed, under the majority’s approach, what prevents anyone with a proclaimed\n\n“substantial interest” from suing a defendant such as the school board here in an attempt\n\nto trample on the rights of an unrepresented third party?41 Because a plaintiff no longer\n\n\n       41\n          May I sue a landlord under a local noise ordinance for failing to evict my noisy\nneighbor without notice to my neighbor? May I sue the police department for failing to\nticket the teenagers loitering outside my favorite window seat at a local restaurant? In\neach case, I might allege that the defendant had a duty to enforce a particular law and that\nI had a “substantial interest” in its enforcement under the facts presented. Further, in\neach case, the named defendant may be perfectly willing to comply with my demands\nand happy to do so without arguing, as defendants do here, that the case should not\nproceed because I have no right to govern his relationship with the third party or affect\nthe absent third party’s rights. This Court expressed similar concerns regarding the view\nof the judicial power offered by the dissent in Nat’l Wildlife Fed—which the majority\ntoday overrules—when discussing environmental suits brought under MCL 324.1701(1)\nof the Michigan environmental protection act:\n\n              Under th[e former dissenting] view of the “judicial power,” “any\n       person,” for example, could seek to enjoin “any person” from mowing his\n       lawn with a gas-powered mower because such activity allegedly creates air\n       pollution and uses fossil fuels when other alternatives are available. “Any\n       person” could sue “any person” for using too much fertilizer on his\n       property, or allowing too much runoff from a feedlot on his property.\n\n\n                                            67\n\fneeds to show a concrete and particularized injury, or that the court actually has the\n\npower to grant relief to me from that defendant, or that the legislative body intended to\n\ncreate a cause of action, presumably any such plaintiff can proceed. Particularly by\n\npermitting plaintiffs to sue to enforce a governmental agency’s statutory duties with no\n\nattention to whether the Legislature intended to create a cause of action, the majority\n\nutterly ignores separation of powers principles including the Legislature’s sole purview to\n\nlegislate such duties and to define the proper mechanisms for their enforcement.42\n\n       Consistent with the majority’s deconstruction of Michigan’s guiding legal\n\nprinciples over the last two years, the result boils down to this: in this state, anyone has\n\n       “Any person” could sue “any person” from using excessive amounts of\n       pesticides in his home or garden or farm. “Any person” could sue “any\n       person” for improperly disposing of used petroleum-based oils. “Any\n       person” could sue “any person” for improper backyard grilling practices,\n       excessive use of aerosol sprays and propellants, or wasteful lawn watering.\n       [471 Mich at 649-650.]\n\nAt least the scenarios presented in Nat’l Wildlife involved suits against the allegedly\noffending party; here, the majority permits plaintiffs to maintain suit despite the absence\nof the students they seek to punish.\n       42\n          Members of the executive branch are thus vulnerable to suits filed by any person\nclaiming a substantial interest in their affairs. I note the following timely illustration of\nwhat may arise. In the midst of the City of Detroit’s ongoing financial woes and the\nongoing crisis its public school system, an activist group joined teachers and school board\nmembers to sue Robert Bobb, the emergency financial manager of the Detroit Public\nSchools, seeking to challenge the salary terms of his contract with the governor and the\nstate superintendent of schools. A circuit court judge dismissed the suit, concluding that\nthe plaintiffs did not have legal standing. Marisa Schultz, Judge throws out lawsuit over\nFinancial Manager Bobb’s pay, The Detroit News, July 29, 2010, available at\n<http://www.detnews.com/article/20100729/SCHOOLS/7290468/1409/Judge-throws-out\n-lawsuit-over-DPS-Financial-Manager-Bobb-s-pay> (accessed July 30, 2010). Under the\nmajority’s new approach, their suit seems tenable because all they have to allege is an ill-\ndefined “substantial interest” in the management of local schools.\n\n\n\n                                             68\n\fstanding to sue anyone else, any time. As in McCormick, ___ Mich ___, for example,\n\nwhere the majority significantly lowered the threshold for suits against Michigan drivers\n\nunder our automobile no-fault insurance scheme,43 the majority continues to encourage\n\nlitigation at a high cost to individuals, the courts, local governments and local officials.\n\nThis complete destabilization of established law benefits no one.\n\n                                    V. CONCLUSION\n\n         For each of these reasons, I dissent. I would affirm the decision of the Court of\n\nAppeals, which reached the correct result and properly applied the law of this state. The\n\nmajority’s conclusion that plaintiffs have standing here is devoid of any analysis and\n\nincorrect under any meaningful test.      Its decision to grant standing here under an\n\namorphous new test of its own making is unprincipled and opportunistic; in its haste to\n\noverrule yet another precedent of this Court, it grants teachers the right to sue for\n\nexpulsion of children from our public schools without any regard for the students’ rights.\n\nFinally, its choice to eschew the well-established Lee test aggregates limitless power in\n\nthe courts, is contrary to our constitution, and will only damage the rule of law in our\n\nstate.\n\n         YOUNG and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with CORRIGAN, J.\n\n\n         43\n          See McCormick, ___ Mich at ___ (MARKMAN, J., dissenting) (“By nullifying the\nlegislative compromise that was struck when the no-fault act was adopted—a\ncompromise grounded in concerns over excessive litigation, the over-compensation of\nminor injuries, and the availability of affordable insurance—the Court’s decision today\nwill restore a legal environment in which each of these hazards reappear and threaten the\ncontinued fiscal soundness of our no-fault system.”).\n\n\n\n                                            69\n\f</pre>",
