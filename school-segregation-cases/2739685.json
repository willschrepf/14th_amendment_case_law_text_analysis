Bennett Survey.\" \r\nThe current dispute arose because Bean did not expressly own \"80 acres in the J. Bennett\r\nSurvey.\"  William Shore is both the independent executor and a devisee of his great-aunt\r\nBean's estate.  Shore's cousins are Tom G. DeWitt, III, James J. DeWitt, and Marlo DeWitt\r\nSenick (the DeWitts).  The DeWitts asked the court to declare which interest(s) passed\r\nunder paragraph 6(3) and which under the residuary clause (devising everything remaining\r\nto the DeWitts).<sup> (1)</sup>  After a jury trial, the judge declared the DeWitts to have prevailed,\r\ndetailed the contours of the paragraph 6(3) conveyance, and assessed attorney's fees\r\nagainst Shore, individually.  Shore and his son, Brenham<sup> (2)</sup> (collectively, the Shores) appeal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores, jointly, raise one issue:  lack of jurisdiction.  Shore, individually, raises\r\nthree additional issues: (1) violation of Rule 301--judgment inconsistent with the pleadings,\r\nevidence, and verdict; (2) improper withdrawal of the surface estate from the jury; and (3)\r\nimproper attorney's fees.  We conclude the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over\r\nthis probate matter and essentially entered a proper declaratory judgment, which requires\r\nonly slight modification.  The trial court erred in assessing fees, and remand on this issue\r\nis required. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND </strong>   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThese parties are before this Court for the third time.<sup> (3)</sup>  The DeWitts' current petition\r\nsought partition, accounting, and distribution of the estate; a declaratory judgment to\r\nconstrue the will; and removal of Shore as the independent executor.  The DeWitts sought\r\na declaration (1) that nothing passed under paragraph 6(3); or, alternatively, (2) \"describing\r\nthe interest which passes pursuant to paragraphs [sic] 6(3)\" and which interest(s) through\r\nthe residuary.  More than a year after the DeWitts' application, Shore executed and filed\r\nan executor's deed consistent with his construction of paragraph 6(3).  The same day,\r\nShore filed an application for discharge and \"Verified Final Accounting,\" claiming full\r\nadministration of the estate.  The trial court then ordered, in an agreed temporary\r\ninjunction, that Shore and the DeWitts refrain from taking further action on the estate\r\nwithout court action.  The DeWitts supplemented their petition to include voiding Shore's\r\nexecutor's deed purporting to convey property pursuant to paragraph 6(3).  The case then\r\nwent to jury trial to determine Bean's intent in paragraph 6(3).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A.\tThe Will Language</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe relevant portions of paragraph 6(3), as amended by two codicils, read:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tRegarding the eighty (80) acres I own in the J. Bennett Survey, I give\r\na life estate to my great-nephews, TOM G. DeWITT, III, JAMES J. DeWITT\r\nand WILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., . . . as life tenants the right to collect, receive,\r\nreceipt for, use, enjoy, possess and consume the income from the gas well\r\non the property . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAt the death of WILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., I bequeath his one-third\r\nshare to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tUpon the death of either TOM G. DeWITT III or JAMES J. DeWITT,\r\nI bequeath his one-third share of the life estate to MARLO ANN DeWITT and\r\nWILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., equally, as a life estate.  Upon the death of the\r\nsurvivor, then I bequeath the entire life estate to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee\r\nsimple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>\tB. \tThe Ambiguity</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the uncontroverted evidence indicated the extent of the estates that Bean\r\nowned and might have contemplated devising under paragraph 6(3).  Back in the 1930s,\r\nBean's parents acquired several properties, totaling 425.59 acres.  In 1972, Bean and her\r\nsiblings partitioned the surface, creating Bean's 77.83-acre surface estate.  The siblings\r\nexpressly excepted the mineral estate from the partition; each sibling still owned a 1/5\r\nundivided interest in the 425.59-acre mineral estate.  At the time she drafted her will in\r\n1995 and at her death in 2000, Bean owned the 77.83-acre surface estate in the Bennett\r\nand Chaddick surveys and the 1/5 undivided interest in the 425.59-acre mineral estate in\r\nthe Bennett, Chaddick, McAnulty, and Ravey surveys.  On questioning by the Shores at\r\ntrial, James DeWitt agreed that the 1/5 interest in the 425.59-acre mineral estate\r\nconstituted a \"mineral estate of 85.1 acres.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores took the position that Bean intended to convey both the surface estate\r\nand the entire mineral estate.  In support, the Shores introduced evidence of other devises\r\nin Bean's will that approximated the acreage of the estates and surveys involved.  The\r\nDeWitts, in support of their position that paragraph 6(3) conveyed only one gas well,\r\nsubmitted evidence of sixteen wells, including one on Bean's 77.83 surface acreage, from\r\nwhich Bean drew income.  The Shores presented evidence that only three of these sixteen\r\nwells were on the 425.59-acre tract, since Bean's interest was pooled.  They also, to refute\r\nthe \"one well\" theory, presented evidence that the well on the 77.83 surface acres was not\r\ndrilled until after both the will and the first codicil (but before the second codicil) were\r\nsigned.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tThe Jury Charge</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores submitted a proposed jury question, denied by the court, that asked\r\nwhether paragraph 6(3) conveyed the mineral interest in the 425.59-acre tract.  Question\r\n2, as initially presented by the court at the charge conference, asked whether Bean\r\nconveyed \"one particular gas well or . . . her undivided mineral interest <em>in the real property.</em>\" \r\n(Emphasis added.)   The Shores did not object to this question.  The DeWitts did object\r\nand asked the court to change \"in the real property\" to \"in the 77.83 acre tract.\"  The\r\nchange essentially removed the Shores' position from the jury's consideration.  The court,\r\non the record, overruled the DeWitts' objection.  The court also ruled that the surface\r\nestate was unambiguously not included in paragraph 6(3).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen the court charged the jury, however, it asked about the surface estate and\r\nincorporated the overruled DeWitts' change to Question 2.  The jury was charged and\r\nanswered as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>QUESTION 1.</strong> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tDo you find that the \"eighty (80) acres I own in the J. Bennett Survey\"\r\nin paragraph 6(3) of the Last Will and Testament of Mary Ann Bean is the\r\n77.83 acre tract owned by Mary Ann Bean at the time of her death?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer \"Yes\" or \"No.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer:  Yes</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf you have answered \"Yes\" to Question 1, then answer the following\r\nquestion.  . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>QUESTION 2.</strong> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tDo you find that Mary Ann Bean intended to convey her interest in one\r\nparticular gas well or her undivided interest in the 77.83 acre tract?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer \"one particular gas well\" or \"her undivided mineral interest.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer:  \"her undivided mineral interest.\"<sup> (4)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The judgment declared that paragraph 6(3) conveyed the minerals situated \"in and under\r\nand that may be produced and saved from\" the boundaries of the 77.83-acre surface tract,\r\nwith the remainder of Bean's real property (save that described in two other will paragraphs\r\nnot at issue), including the 77.83-acre surface estate and the remaining 347.76-acre\r\nmineral estate passing to the DeWitts through the residuary. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThough the Shores appear to have properly objected to and preserved error on the\r\njury questions below, they do not raise this error on appeal.<sup> (5)</sup>  Instead, the Shores' appeal\r\nprogresses on the presumption that the jury <em>was</em> asked about Bean's entire undivided\r\nmineral interest (i.e., 77.83 means 1/5 of 425.59). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>II.\tJURISDICTION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A.\tStandard of Review </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law an appellate court\r\nreviews de novo by examining the pleadings and any other evidence relevant to the\r\ndetermination. <em> Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n v. IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855\r\n(Tex. 2002).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores make two jurisdictional challenges.  First, that the court has no\r\njurisdiction to construe a will or order partition and distribution under independent\r\nadministration.  Second, that this particular independent administration was closed at the\r\ntime of the trial, thereby divesting the court of jurisdiction. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B.\tJurisdiction to Construe a Will Under Independent Administration</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have already ruled on the first jurisdictional challenge in this case. <em> See Bean I</em>,\r\n120 S.W.3d at 919 (\"pursuant to the UDJA [Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act], the trial\r\ncourt was not deprived of jurisdiction to construe Bean's will merely because it had\r\nappointed an independent executor\").  The Shores ask us to reconsider that decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs before, the Shores rely on Section 145(h) of the Texas Probate Code, which\r\nprohibits \"further action of any nature\" in the county court \"except where the Code\r\nspecifically and explicitly provides for some action in the county court.\"<sup> (6)</sup>  Tex. Prob. Code\r\nAnn. § 145(h) (Vernon 2003).  The Shores contend that Section 145(h) requires specific\r\nand explicit reference to only those sections of the Texas Probate Code detailing\r\nindependent administration, yet they provide no authority to support the contention that\r\nSection 145(h)'s reference to \"the code\" actually means \"<em>this chapter of</em> the code.\"  As the\r\nShores' interpretation is unsupported, and is in direct conflict with the actual statutory\r\nlanguage, we are unpersuaded. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSection 5(f) of the Probate Code both specifically and explicitly states:  \"All courts\r\nexercising original probate jurisdiction shall have the power to hear all matters incident to\r\nan estate.\"  Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 5 (Vernon Supp. 2006).<sup> (7)</sup>  Section 5A(a) further\r\nclarifies matters by defining \"incident to an estate\" as including, but not limited to:  \"all\r\nactions for trial of title to land incident to an estate . . . all actions for trial of the right of\r\nproperty incident to an estate, and actions to construe wills, and generally all matters\r\nrelating to the settlement, partition, and distribution of estates of deceased persons.\"  Tex.\r\nProb. Code Ann. § 5A(a) (Vernon Supp. 2006); <em>see also Wallace v. Collins</em>, 988 S.W.d\r\n258, 260 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1998, pet. denied) (\"The trial court has the power to hear\r\nall matters incident to an estate . . . .\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores' cases in support of their argument are inapposite.  This is not a dispute\r\nbetween devisees or legatees and the executor regarding distribution consistent with the\r\nterms of a will. Instead, this is an action to construe the will itself, as a necessary\r\nprerequisite to distribution.  Neither is this a case in which one court does not have\r\njurisdiction because <em>another</em> court does. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores present no authority, and we are aware of none, indicating an\r\nindependent executor's unilateral authority to construe a will.  Neither do the Shores\r\npresent any authority, and we are not aware of any, holding that <em>all</em> courts are divested of\r\nthe power to construe wills under independent administration, as the Shores would have\r\nthis Court hold.  In fact, the Shores' leading case presumes <em>some</em> court's ability to construe\r\na will in an independently administered estate.  <em>See Burke v. Satterfield</em>, 525 S.W.2d 950\r\n(Tex. 1975) (holding probate court lacked jurisdiction to enforce a will as it was construed\r\nby a district court). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile court jurisdiction over independently administered estates is limited, it is not\r\neliminated.  <em>See</em> <em>McCaffity v. Ramsey</em>, 274 S.W.2d 194, 196 (Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1954,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.).  It is long established that courts must ensure that an independent\r\nexecutor \"is faithfully carrying out the provisions of the will.\"  <em>Cocke v. Smith</em>, 142 Tex. 396,\r\n179 S.W.2d 954, 957 (1944); <em>see also John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Duval</em>, 96\r\nS.W.2d 740, 742 (Tex. Civ. App.--Eastland 1936, writ ref'd) (court authorized to \"require\r\nthe executor, independent or otherwise, to comply with the express directions contained\r\nin the will\").  Where, as here, the meaning of the will itself is unclear, a court must invoke\r\nits jurisdiction under Sections 5 and 5A of the Texas Probate Code to determine the proper\r\nconstruction of the will.  <em>Accord Estate of Hanau v. Hanau</em>, 730 S.W.2d 663 (Tex. 1987)\r\n(court engages in \"characterizing\" property for proper distribution in independently\r\nadministered estate).  Once the court construes the will, the independent administrator may\r\nthen faithfully execute the will, free of judicial supervision, to effect distribution of the\r\nestate. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the issue was already decided in <em>Bean I</em>, because the Shores present no\r\nauthority in support of the contention that <em>no</em> court has the authority to construe a will, and\r\nbecause the Shores do not contend the trial court was the incorrect court under Sections\r\n5 or 5A, the point of error is accordingly overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tJurisdiction Over a \"Closed\" Estate</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the Shores' second jurisdictional challenge, which they characterize as a question\r\nof mootness, they contend the court had no jurisdiction since the estate was fully\r\nadministered prior to trial.  The Shores claim that the filing, a year into this litigation but\r\nbefore trial, of the executor's deed over the property at issue constituted the final\r\ndistribution of the estate assets (save for allowable reserves and third party royalty checks). \r\nThey contend that, with all debts paid and assets distributed pursuant to Section 149D of\r\nthe Texas Probate Code, Shore, through his application for discharge under Section 149E,\r\nformally announced that the estate was closed. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn support of their position, the Shores cite <em>Wallace v. Collins</em>, 988 S.W.2d 258 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 1998, pet. denied), for the proposition that an independent executor's\r\ndistribution of assets immediately and automatically closes an estate, rendering moot all\r\nmatters of administration, including accounting, distribution, and will construction.  The\r\nShores misstate two points of the law in coming to their conclusion.  First, <em>Wallace</em> never\r\nremoved the statutory requirement of a court's acceptance of the independent executor's\r\napplication.  <em>See </em>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 149E(c) (Vernon 2003) (requiring court\r\nadjudication of independent executor's application).  Second,<em> Wallace</em> never goes so far\r\nas to include will construction among those areas of \"administration\" under an independent\r\nexecutor's powers.  Will construction is for the court, not the independent executor (see\r\ndiscussion above).  Since the construction of paragraph 6(3) was a live controversy at the\r\ntime of Shore's executor's deed conveying property under that paragraph, that property\r\nwas never rightfully included among \"property of the estate that remains in the hands of\r\nthe independent executor.\"  <em>See </em>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 149D(a) (Vernon 2003).  Indeed,\r\nthe property that Shore purported to convey had been removed from his hands by virtue\r\nof the pending litigation. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditionally, while this litigation was pending, and after Shore filed his application,\r\nthe parties entered into the agreed injunction, essentially deferring to the court on estate\r\nmatters.  The Shores' agreement to this undermines their contention that Shore had\r\nunilaterally removed the estate from the court's jurisdiction.  Considering that the court had\r\naccepted jurisdiction over the construction of the will, signed the agreed temporary\r\ninjunction, and set the will construction matter for trial, the court was within its authority to\r\nnot accept Shore's distribution as appropriate under Section 149D, or his Section 149E\r\napplication as timely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores cite <em>In re Estate of Hanau</em>, 806 S.W.2d 900 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi\r\n1991, writ denied), for the proposition that an estate is closed on asset distribution and the\r\nindependent executor's filing of a final account, whether or not litigation is pending. <em>Hanau\r\n</em>allowed closing an estate by the independent executor's affidavit under Section 151 of the\r\nTexas Probate Code despite pending litigation.  However, the Legislature amended\r\nSection 151 in 1995, four years after <em>Hanau</em> was decided, to prohibit exactly the situation\r\nencountered in the present matter and approved in <em>Hanau</em>--closing an estate under\r\nSection 151 during pending litigation.  <em>See</em> Act of May 24, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 642,\r\n§ 5, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 3516, 3518.  Section 151 now reads that an independent\r\nadministrator may close an estate by affidavit only \"when there is no pending litigation.\" \r\nTex. Prob. Code Ann. § 151(a) (Vernon 2003).  The evidence is undisputed that Shore\r\nfiled his affidavit to close the estate over a year after this litigation was begun.  His\r\napplication and affidavit may not thus unilaterally defeat the DeWitts' pending applications\r\nunder Section 151.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause litigation was pending, the estate was neither fully administered nor\r\ndischarged, and the estate was not closed under either Section 151 or Section 149E, the\r\nShores' claimed jurisdictional error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>III.\tTEXAS RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 301</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A.\tThe</strong> <strong>Pleadings</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA judgment cannot stand unless it is supported by pleadings and evidence.  Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 301.  The pleadings invoke the trial court's jurisdiction to render a judgment, and\r\na judgment which the pleadings do not support is considered void.  <em>Hubbard v. Lagow</em>, 576\r\nS.W.2d 163, 166 (Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  All pleadings shall be\r\nconstrued so as to do substantial justice.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 45.  The purpose of pleading is\r\nto give the adversary parties notice of each party's claims and defenses, as well as notice\r\nof the relief sought.<em>  Perez v. Briercroft Serv. Corp.</em>, 809 S.W.2d 216, 218 (Tex. 1991).  In\r\ndetermining whether a cause of action was pleaded, the court must find the plaintiff's\r\npleadings adequate to state, with reasonable certainty and without reference to information\r\nfrom another source, the elements of the cause of action and the relief sought with\r\nsufficient particularity to allow the court to base a judgment. <em>Stoner v. Thompson</em>, 578\r\nS.W.2d 679, 683 (Tex. 1979).  Pleadings will generally be construed as favorably as\r\npossible to the pleader.  <em>Gulf, Colo. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. Bliss</em>, 368 S.W.2d 594, 599 (Tex.\r\n1963). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore contends the judgment resulted in a partition of Bean's mineral estate where\r\nno partition had been sought in the pleadings.  The judgment does not, however, order\r\npartition.  While partition will now be necessary, the judgment merely construes the will\r\nprovision, as requested in the pleadings.  Partition appears to be left to be accomplished\r\nthrough later distribution of the estate.  As such, the question really is:  Could the pleadings\r\nbe construed to request that only part of the mineral estate pass through paragraph 6(3)? \r\nThe answer is:  Of course.  The DeWitts' application sought a declaration \"describing the\r\ninterest which passes pursuant to paragraphs [sic] 6(3)\" and which interest(s) through the\r\nresiduary.  This put the Shores on notice that the DeWitts sought some or all of the\r\ndisputed property to pass through the residuary.  The very fact of the petition served as\r\nnotice that the DeWitts wanted less than Bean's full ownership to pass via paragraph 6(3).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B.\tThe \"Case Proved\"</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore contends no evidence was submitted on a devise of less than Bean's full\r\nownership interest other than the evidence in support of the one-well theory, which the jury\r\nexpressly rejected.  A jury finding is not based on legally sufficient evidence if:  (a) there\r\nis a complete absence of evidence to support the finding, (b) the court is barred by rules\r\nof law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove the matter\r\nfound, (c) the evidence offered to prove the matter found is no more than a mere scintilla,\r\nor (d) the evidence conclusively establishes a different finding.  <em>See Merrell Dow Pharm.,\r\nInc. v. Havner</em>, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997).  Shore's legal sufficiency point requires\r\nthis Court to consider only the evidence and inferences that tend to support the finding and\r\ndisregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary.  <em>Bradford v. Vento</em>, 48 S.W.3d 749,\r\n754 (Tex. 2001).  Anything more than a scintilla of evidence is legally sufficient to support\r\nthe finding. <em> Cont'l Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez</em>, 937 S.W.2d 444, 450 (Tex. 1996).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThough Shore's point of error presumes that the weight of the evidence supports\r\na finding that Bean conveyed her full mineral estate, when no objection is made to a jury\r\ninstruction, we review the sufficiency of the evidence in light of the charge submitted.  <em>See\r\nCity of Fort Worth v. Zimlich</em>, 29 S.W.3d 62, 71 (Tex. 2000); <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\r\nSturges</em>, 52 S.W.3d 711, 715 n.4 (Tex. 2001).  It is the court's charge, not some other\r\nunidentified law, that measures the sufficiency of the evidence when the opposing party\r\nfails to object to the charge.  <em>Osterberg v. Peca</em>, 12 S.W.3d 31, 55 (Tex. 2000). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe charge asked the jury if Bean conveyed an interest in one part of her mineral\r\nestate or another part of her mineral estate.  A mineral estate must be defined by\r\nboundaries so that it may be located.  <em>See, e.g., Sharp v. Fowler</em>, 151 Tex. 490, 252\r\nS.W.2d 153, 154 (Tex. 1952).  Although Question 2 references \"the 77.83 acre tract\"\r\nwithout reference to metes and bounds or a more particular description, it does use the\r\ndefinitive article \"the\" and the jury heard evidence referencing one 77.83-acre tract that\r\nsupports its finding.  Moreover, the evidence supports that the 77.83 acres was within the\r\nboundaries of the 425.59 acres.  None of this evidence has been challenged as\r\ninadmissible or unreliable.  As such, more than a scintilla of evidence supports the finding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>C.\tThe Verdict</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is fundamental to our system of jurisprudence that the trial court may not\r\nsubstitute its judgment for that of a jury.  <em>Anthony v. Mays</em>, 777 S.W.2d 200, 203 (Tex.\r\nApp.--San Antonio 1989, no writ).  The trial court's duty, and ours, is to ascertain the\r\nintention of the jury's answers and render a judgment in conformity with them.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 301;<em> State v. Hale</em>, 136 Tex. 29, 146 S.W.2d 731, 739 (1941).  Appellate courts\r\nare further mandated to try to interpret jury findings so as to uphold the trial court's\r\njudgment.  <em>See First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n of Dallas v. Sharp</em>, 359 S.W.2d 902, 903\r\n(Tex. 1962).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore does not deny that the judgment language almost exactly tracks the language\r\nin Question 2 of the jury's verdict.  Nonetheless, Shore contends that the judgment\r\nincorrectly interprets the meaning of the language.  Shore presents no authority persuading\r\nus that \"in the\" 77.83-acre tract must mean \"associated with\" or \"flowing back to\" the\r\n77.83-acre tract, to use Shore's phrases.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore also contends \"interpreting\" Question 2 as contemplating less than Bean's\r\nfull mineral estate creates an internal inconsistency within Question 2.<sup> (8)</sup>  That is, if the jury\r\nanswered Question 2 \"one well,\" it could have answered Question 3 by naming any one\r\nof the sixteen wells from which Bean received income, only three of which were on the\r\n425.59 acres and only one of which was on the 77.83-acre surface estate.  Shore contends\r\nthat, if Question 2's phrase \"one well\" implicates Bean's full ownership interest, then\r\nQuestion 2's phrase \"undivided mineral interest\" must as well.  The fairness of the phrasing\r\nof the question is not an argument properly made under Rule 301.  The jury was presented\r\nalternate theories of interpretation, one of which asked if Bean intended to convey her\r\nmineral interest in 77.83 acres.  The jury said she did.  The judgment conforms with this\r\nanswer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore further contends an undivided interest in 77.83 acres is no different than the\r\ninterest in the one well on the property--a position rejected by the jury.  However close\r\nthese two choices may be, though, they do differ.  The judgment does not require, as\r\nShore contends, that only minerals physically touching the 77.83-acre surface estate were\r\nconveyed.  Rather, the judgment allows for pooling and full ownership of the mineral estate\r\nas defined by the boundaries of the 77.83-acre surface estate.  The judgment would let the\r\nShores drill 500 wells on those 77.83 acres if they felt so compelled (and were otherwise\r\nnot prohibited).  Meanwhile, Shore presents no authority and points to nothing in the record\r\nin support of the contention that one must convey the full extent of what one owns--i.e.,\r\nthat Bean could convey her interest in the 425.59 acres but nothing less--or that the will\r\ncannot support a construction which conveys less than Bean's full ownership interest. \r\nBecause the entry of judgment is consistent with the pleadings and case proved, and\r\nconforms with the jury's answers to the questions asked, these points of error are\r\noverruled. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>D. \tThe Devisees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore also contends the trial court erred in entering that part of the judgment\r\ndescribing the remainder life estates.  Paragraph 6(3), after providing for William, Tom, and\r\nJames to share a life estate, devises the property as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAt the death of WILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., I bequeath his one-third\r\nshare to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tUpon the death of either TOM G. DeWITT, III or JAMES J. DeWITT\r\nI bequeath his one-third share of the life estate to MARLO ANN DeWITT and\r\nWILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., equally, as a life estate. Upon the death of the\r\nsurvivor, then I bequeath the entire life estate to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee\r\nsimple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The court restated this part of paragraph 6(3) in the judgment as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t1.\t1/3 . . . to Tom G. DeWitt, III, for life with remainder equally to Marlo\r\nAnn DeWitt Senick and William R. Shore for life and with remainder\r\nto Brenham Shore, in fee simple, upon the death of the survivor;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t2.\t1/3 . . . to James Jay DeWitt for life with remainder equally to Marlo\r\nAnn DeWitt Senick and William R. Shore for life and with remainder\r\nto Brenham Shore, in fee simple, upon the death of the survivor; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t3.\t1/3 . . . to William R. Shore for life with remainder to Brenham Shore,\r\nin fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tShore contends the judgment as rendered misstates the remainder life estate in\r\nWilliam and Marlo created at the death of James or Tom.  He further contends this part of\r\nthe judgment serves as a reformation of the devisees not requested in the pleadings.  We\r\nagree with Shore that the will provides that the remainder life estate in William and Marlo\r\nis created at the death of the first of James and Tom and is measured by the survivor of\r\nthe other of James and Tom.  We further agree that the judgment misstates the\r\nunambiguous terms of the will by allowing for two remainder life estates and by measuring\r\nthe remainder life estates by the survivor of Marlo or William. \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor these reasons, and because the DeWitts essentially concede that the judgment\r\nmay require modification on this point, we hereby modify the judgment to provide that: \r\n(1) the numbered paragraphs 1-3 on the unnumbered third page of the declaratory\r\njudgment (as quoted above) are deleted; and (2) the following paragraphs are substituted:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t1.\t1/3 each to Tom G. DeWitt, III, James Jay DeWitt, and William R. Shore, Jr.,\r\nfor life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t2.\tAt the death of William R. Shore, Jr., William R. Shore, Jr.'s, 1/3 share to\r\nBrenham Shore in fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t3.\tAt the death of the first of Tom G. DeWitt, III and James Jay DeWitt, the\r\ndeceased's 1/3 share to Marlo Ann DeWitt Senick and William R. Shore, Jr.,\r\nequally, for the life of the survivor of James Jay DeWitt and Tom G. DeWitt,\r\nIII.  At the death of the second of Tom G. DeWitt, III and James Jay DeWitt,\r\nboth Tom G. DeWitt, III's and James Jay DeWitt's shares to Brenham Shore,\r\nin fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>IV. \tREMOVING THE SURFACE ESTATE FROM THE JURY</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWill construction is only a matter for a jury if the provision at issue is ambiguous as\r\na matter of law.  \"If the court can give a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation\r\nto the words used, the will is unambiguous, and the court should construe it as a matter\r\nof law.\" <em> Steger v. Muenster Drilling Co.</em>, 134 S.W.3d 359, 373 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth\r\n2003, pet. denied). The trial court ruled as a matter of law that the will was unambiguous\r\nin contemplating only a mineral estate.  Shore contends this was error since (1) evidence\r\nsubmitted supports a different conclusion; and (2) the jury appears, in Question 1, to have\r\nagreed that paragraph 6(3) conveyed a surface estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis extrinsic evidence and alleged verdict are not capable of transforming\r\nunambiguous will language into ambiguous language.  A testator's intent must be\r\ndiscerned from \"the language found within the four corners of the will\" through a careful\r\nexamination of the words used.  <em>San Antonio Area Found. v. Lang</em>, 35 S.W.3d 636, 639\r\n(Tex. 2000).  \"If the will is unambiguous, a court should not go beyond specific terms in\r\nsearch of the testatrix's intent.\"  <em>Id.</em>  Therefore, \"extrinsic evidence applies only when a term\r\nis open to more than one construction.\"  <em>Id.</em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe will reads:  \"[r]egarding the eighty (80) acres . . . I give a life estate . . . to . . .\r\nthe gas well.\"  The language clearly contemplates a mineral estate, but makes no mention\r\nof a surface estate.  Moreover, the will specifies various mineral property rights and is silent\r\non any rights attendant to the surface estate.  Shore contends the use of the phrase \"fee\r\nsimple\" requires (1) a conveyance coextensive with Bean's ownership interests; and (2) a\r\nmerging of the two estates.  We have addressed the former of these contentions above,\r\nand add only that the judgment does convey a fee interest in the land described in\r\nQuestion 2.  As to the latter contention, Shore presents no authority for the proposition that\r\nthe fee conveyance of a severed mineral estate must merge with the fee interest in the\r\nsevered surface estate.  In fact, the merger of a lesser estate into a greater \"is disfavored\r\nin Texas.\"  <em>Steger</em>, 134 S.W.3d at 376.  Merger must not occur when it is \"contrary to the\r\nintention of the owner of the two estates.\"  <em>Id.</em>  The Bean family expressly severed the\r\nsurface and mineral estates in 1972.  While the severance of the estates indicates an\r\nintent against merger, Shore points to no evidence in the record indicating that Bean\r\nintended to merge the estates.  The point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>V.\tATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS OF COURT</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe DeWitts presented evidence of an aggregated fee to the jury.  The evidence\r\nreferenced the community fee norm and the attorney's hourly rate, but did not break down\r\nthe fee to specific tasks or dates.  The jury found that the \"reasonable fee for necessary\r\nservice of Plaintiff's attorney in this case\" was $28,614.17.  The court assessed that fee\r\nagainst Shore, individually.  Shore claims several points of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A. \tEvidentiary Sufficiency</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tReview of attorney's fees under the UDJA requires a \"multi-faceted review involving\r\nboth evidentiary and discretionary matters.\"  <em>Bocquet v. Herring</em>, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex.\r\n1998).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[I]n reviewing an attorney fee award under the Act [UDJA], the court of\r\nappeals must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by\r\nawarding fees when there was insufficient evidence that the fees were\r\nreasonable and necessary, or when the award was inequitable or unjust. \r\nUnreasonable fees <em>cannot</em> be awarded, even if the court believed them just,\r\nbut the court may conclude that it is not equitable or just to award even\r\nreasonable and necessary fees.  <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em>  \"[T]he Declaratory Judgments Act entrusts attorney fee awards to the trial court's sound\r\ndiscretion, subject to the requirements that any fees awarded be reasonable and\r\nnecessary, which are matters of fact, and to the additional requirements that fees be\r\nequitable and just, which are matters of law.\"  <em>Neely v. W. Orange-Cove Consol. Indep.\r\nSch. Dist.</em>, 176 S.W.3d 746, 799 (Tex. 2005).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe reasonableness and necessity of attorney's fees \"is a question of fact for the\r\njury's determination.\"  <em>Bocquet</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 21.  Shore does not dispute that the jury\r\nfound the fees assessed to be reasonable and necessary.  Shore instead asserts that fees\r\nmay only be determined to be reasonable and necessary on a showing and consideration\r\nof each of the eight factors listed in the disciplinary rules.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Disciplinary P.\r\n1.04, <em>reprinted in</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann., tit. 2, subtit. G app. A-1 (Vernon 2005).  The\r\ncaselaw is clear, however, that this list is a <em>guide</em> for the fact-finder.  <em>See, e.g., Bocquet</em>,\r\n972 S.W.2d at 21.  We decline to extend the law to mandate the showing of each of the\r\neight factors as a prerequisite for fee recovery.  This point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B. \tNonprevailing Parties </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore next contends that the DeWitts, as nonprevailing parties, are not entitled to\r\nfees or costs.  However, nonprevailing parties are allowed to recover fees under the UDJA. \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009  (Vernon 1997) (\"In any proceeding under\r\nthis chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as\r\nare equitable and just.\"); <em>Barshop v. Medina County Underground Water Conservation\r\nDist.</em>, 925 S.W.2d 618, 637 (Tex. 1996) (\"attorney's fees in declaratory judgment actions\r\nis clearly within the trial court's discretion and is not dependent on a finding that a party\r\n'substantially prevailed'\"); <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Travis</em>, 68 S.W.3d 72, 77 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 2001, pet. denied).  Shore admits as much, but contends that, under the\r\nequity prong of the fee analysis, the award of fees to a nonprevailing party is neither\r\nequitable nor just.  Though Shore presents several cases in which fee awards to \"the\r\nprevailing party\" were remanded for reconsideration when the appellate court reversed on\r\nthe merits, none of these cases requires that a party must prevail as a prerequisite for\r\nrecovery.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Neely</em>, 176 S.W.3d at 799.  The argument that the award of fees to\r\na nonprevailing party is de facto unjust is inconsistent with the explicit language in the\r\nstatute and the caselaw.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, we do not agree that the DeWitts did not prevail.  A prevailing party is\r\n\"one of the parties to a suit who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends\r\nagainst it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent of its original\r\ncontention.\"  <em>City of Amarillo v. Glick</em>, 991 S.W.2d 14, 17 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1997, no\r\npet.).  While the DeWitts did not succeed in getting both the surface and mineral estates\r\nto pass through the residuary clause, they did get the court to declare the surface estate\r\nand most of the mineral estate to pass through the residuary clause.  Shore contends the\r\njury answered each question (except for the amount of attorney's fees) against the DeWitts\r\nin favor of the answer for which the Shores argued,  and so the Shores prevailed.  But, as\r\nShakespeare wrote, \"[T]here's small choice in rotten apples.\" Shakespeare, <em>The Taming\r\nof the Shrew</em>, act 1, sc. 1, lines 134-35.  While the jury answered as much in the Shores'\r\nfavor as it could, the jury was never asked to consider the surface estate or the bulk of the\r\nmineral estate, which the trial court had already excised in the DeWitts' favor.  The Shores\r\ndid not prevail, and the point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tThe Award Against Shore Individually</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore seeks reversal of the fees assessed against him individually, rather than in\r\nhis capacity as executor.  Essentially, Shore contends the individual award is inequitable\r\nand unjust, noting that the declaration sought to undo certain actions that he had taken as\r\nexecutor and not as an individual.  At trial, the DeWitts addressed Shore only in his\r\nrepresentative capacity.  The DeWitts told the jury that Shore, \"acting as executor for Mary\r\nAnn Bean, made a deed.  And that deed doesn't look like this will\" and that \"that's why\r\nwe're here.\"  The DeWitts continued that \"we need to hold this executor to the terms of the\r\nwill under which he is serving.\"  It does seem to be both inequitable and unjust, as those\r\nterms are used colloquially, to assess fees against Shore, individually.  But the colloquial\r\nuse of the words is not at issue.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe DeWitts assert that Shore waived this issue on appeal by not objecting to the\r\ncapacity under which fees were sought at trial.  We agree.  Failing to obtain a ruling on his\r\nindividual liability in the trial court, the issue was within the trial court's discretion \"to assess\r\nattorney's fees against any or all parties.\"  <em>46933, Inc. v. Z &amp; B Enters., Inc.</em>, 899 S.W.2d\r\n800, 809 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1995, writ denied); <em>see also</em> <em>Ray Malooly Trust v. Juhl</em>, 186\r\nS.W.3d 568, 571 (Tex. 2006).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis Court may only reverse the award on a finding that the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion by deciding the issue without reference to any guiding rules or principles.  <em>See\r\nDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc.</em>, 701 S.W.2d 238 (Tex. 1985); <em>Beaumont Bank,\r\nN.A. v. Buller</em>, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex. 1991).  The fact that Shore did appear both as\r\nthe executor and as an individual provides support for the award against him individually. \r\nBecause the trial court acted within its discretion in assessing the fees against Shore as\r\none of the named parties, this point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>D. \tSegregation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Shore contends the fee award was in error for failure to segregate the fees\r\nbetween parties and causes.  A party seeking to recover attorney's fees must segregate\r\nthose fees attributable to different parties or causes, except \"when the attorney's fees\r\nrendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are so\r\ninterrelated that their 'prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same\r\nfacts.'\"  <em>Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Tex. 1991) (quoting<em> Flint &amp;\r\nAssoc. v. Intercontinental Pipe &amp; Steel, Inc.</em>, 739 S.W.2d 622, 624-25 (Tex. App.--Dallas\r\n1987, writ denied)).  On a finding that the fees are capable of segregation, this Court must\r\nremand the fee issue to the trial court.  <em>Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 12.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\t1. \tSeparate Parties</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore contends the DeWitts' failure to segregate fees between defendants\r\nconstituted reversible error.  \"[I]n order to show the reasonableness and necessity of\r\nattorney's fees, the plaintiff is required to show that the fees were incurred while suing the\r\ndefendant sought to be charged . . . .\"  <em>Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 10.  <em>Sterling</em> does not\r\nextend as far as Shore would have it--i.e., that, in all cases with multiple defendants, fees\r\n<em>must</em> be segregated.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>AU Pharm., Inc. v. Boston</em>, 986 S.W.2d 331, 337 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 1999, no pet.) (action against Ivy and AU on same claim need not be\r\nsegregated where interests the same).  Shore fails to indicate any way in which any\r\ndefendant's interest diverges from another's so as to render fees against one unattributable\r\nagainst another.  The pleadings indicate that Shore answered with the same position both\r\nindividually and as executor<sup> (9)</sup> and that Brenham made no answer, though his mother did\r\nappear as his guardian at trial.<sup> (10)</sup>  It is not unreasonable or an abuse to not segregate\r\nbetween nondivergent defendants.  <em>See Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 11.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\t2.\tSeparate Causes</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Attorney's fees incurred in defending a separate lawsuit cannot be recovered under\r\nsection 37.009 of the Act, notwithstanding that the separate lawsuit concerned the same\r\nissues as those in the declaratory judgment suit.\"  <em>Dalisa, Inc. v. Bradford</em>, 81 S.W.3d 876,\r\n880 n.2 (Tex. App.--Austin 2002, no pet.).  Shore contends the fees incurred in <em>Bean I\r\n</em>were improperly not segregated from fees incurred after the filing of the petition in this suit\r\nin December 2003.  The DeWitts admit that the evidence on fees submitted to the jury\r\nwent back to work from 2001, during the prior suit and unsuccessful appeal, but contend\r\nthat the current petition is a mere \"amendment\" of the prior one.  We disagree.  Because\r\nthe 2001 declaratory judgment action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in the trial court,\r\nit may not be \"amended.\"  That the cause number is the same in both suits is irrelevant\r\nsince the cause number under which both actions--that from 2001 and the current one\r\ninitiated in 2003--were docketed is actually the cause assigned to the probate of Bean's\r\nestate, and not exclusive to any particular petition on that estate.  To this end, the DeWitts\r\nare not, in this declaratory judgment action, entitled to fees from the 2001 lawsuit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore also contends the fees were not segregated between different causes of\r\naction filed since 2003.  Shore asserts that fees are only available for work done on the\r\ndeclaratory judgment and not the petitions for an accounting and distribution and for the\r\nremoval of Shore as executor.  The DeWitts' attorney, in submitting his evidence of fees\r\nat trial, stated that  he \"went through and omitted from our bill things that I saw that did not\r\nrelate to the declaratory judgment action.\"  However, in the DeWitts' \"Supplemental Petition\r\nfor Declaratory Judgment,\" submitted days before trial, the DeWitts sought \"all relief\r\nrequested in other active pleadings which are presently on file\" and \"such other and further\r\nrelief to which Plaintiff / Applicants may be justly entitled and for which they will ever pray.\" \r\nThis would seem to include, under the banner of \"work on the declaratory judgment,\" work\r\non all pleadings in the case, including the removal of the executor and for an accounting\r\nand distribution.  The declaratory judgment rendered does not purport, however, to\r\ndistribute the estate, require a final accounting, or remove the executor.<sup> (11)</sup>  The broad\r\nprayer for relief in the DeWitts' supplemental application requires segregation between the\r\ncauses of action beyond the trial assertion that things that did not \"relate\" were segregated. \r\nThe DeWitts are entitled to, at most, those fees attributable to will construction and quiet\r\ntitle since the December 2003 petition.  Accordingly, Shore's contention in this regard is\r\nsustained.<strong>VI.\tCONCLUSION </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat part of the judgment regarding attorney's fees is reversed and remanded for trial\r\nconsistent with this opinion.

The son's name in the proceedings below and in Bean's will is \"Brenham,\" but he\r\nfiled as \"Brennan\" on appeal.  For consistency, we will use the name \"Brenham\" in this\r\nopinion.\r\n</p><p>3. <em>See</em> <em>In re Estate of Bean</em>, 120 S.W.3d 914 (Tex. App.--Texarkana  2003, pet.\r\ndenied) (<em>Bean I</em>) (finding no jurisdiction to construe will or order partition and distribution\r\nof estate);<em> In re Shore</em>, 106 S.W.3d 817 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2003, orig. proceeding\r\n[leave denied])<span>.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>In <em>Bean I</em>, this Court found two jurisdictional defects:  (1) failure to join Brenham as\r\na necessary party; and (2) failure to wait twenty-four months from the appointment of the\r\nindependent executor before petition.  <em>See Bean I</em>, 120 S.W.3d at 921-22.  This Court also\r\nrejected Shore's contention that the court lacks jurisdiction to construe a will under\r\nindependent administration, an issue Shore raises again in this appeal (see discussion\r\nbelow).\r\n<p>4. The jury did not answer Question 3, naming a particular \"well on the property,\"\r\nsince it had answered Question 2 as an \"undivided interest.\"  Question 4 determined the\r\namount of attorney's fees (see discussion below).\r\n</p><p>5. The Shores would seem to present the issue for review as \"Issues Presented,\"\r\nissue 3:  \"[m]ay a trial court refuse to charge a jury with issues raised by the pleadings and\r\npresented to the jury in the evidence . . . ?\"  However, in the body of the brief, it is obvious\r\nthat this issue only covers the surface estate.  For an issue to be properly before this Court,\r\nthe issue must be supported by argument and authorities and must contain appropriate\r\ncitations to the record.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h);  <em>Knoll v. Neblett</em>, 966 S.W.2d 622, 639\r\n(Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, pet. denied).  When the appellant does not provide\r\nus with argument that is sufficient to make an appellate complaint viable, we will not\r\nperform an independent review of the record and applicable law in order to determine\r\nwhether the error complained of occurred.  <em>Ferguson v. DRG/Colony N., Ltd.</em>, 764 S.W.2d\r\n874, 887 (Tex. App.--Austin 1989, writ denied); <em>Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge\r\nv. Jackson</em>, 732 S.W.2d 407, 412 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  Accordingly,\r\nwe will not consider the propriety of the jury questions asked.  <em>See Fredonia State Bank\r\nv. Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co.</em>, 881 S.W.2d 279, 284 (Tex. 1994);<em> TXO Prod. Co. v. M.D. Mark,\r\nInc.</em>, 999 S.W.2d 137, 143 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied). \r\n</p><p>6. The Shores contend that this Court \"added a phrase\" into Section 145(h) in <em>Bean I</em>\r\nby allowing reference to other codes.  While this Court did find that the UDJA conferred\r\njurisdiction, the decision did not misstate the statute.  The court has jurisdiction to construe\r\nwills under Sections 5 and 5A of the Texas Probate Code.  That will construction is\r\naccomplished via an action under the UDJA is irrelevant, since such an action is made\r\npursuant to the authority under Section 5A of the Texas Probate Code.\r\n</p><p>7. We are aware that Sections 5 and 5A of the Texas Probate Code were amended\r\nin 2003.  The particular language we address was not changed.  Since our analysis is not\r\naffected, we cite the current version for your convenience.\r\n</p><p>8. This is not an argument that the jury's answers to different questions are\r\nirreconcilable. Rather, under the guise of Rule 301, it seems to be a challenge to the\r\ncourt's ability to enter judgment on a jury question now seen as \"unfair.\"\r\n</p><p>9. The DeWitts served the original petition on Shore, through his attorney, as\r\nindependent executor, individually, and guardian of Brenham.  Shore's pleadings refer to\r\nShore as \"the Independent Executor and one of the defendants.\"\r\n</p><p>10. This Court previously recognized that \"Brenham Shore's interest under the will is\r\nconsistent with that of his father, i.e., however goes Shore's interest, so goes that of\r\nBrenham Shore.\"  <em>Bean I</em>, 120 S.W.3d at 921.\r\n</p><p>11. Shore refers to himself in his pleadings to this Court and in his trial court motion\r\nfor a judgment notwithstanding the verdict as the \"former independent executor.\"  Other\r\nthan his pleadings which so assert, there is no evidence in the record on appeal of his\r\nremoval or discharge as independent executor. \r\n</p></span></p>\r\n</div>",

Bennett Survey.\" \r\nThe current dispute arose because Bean did not expressly own \"80 acres in the J. Bennett\r\nSurvey.\"  William Shore is both the independent executor and a devisee of his great-aunt\r\nBean's estate.  Shore's cousins are Tom G. DeWitt, III, James J. DeWitt, and Marlo DeWitt\r\nSenick (the DeWitts).  The DeWitts asked the court to declare which interest(s) passed\r\nunder paragraph 6(3) and which under the residuary clause (devising everything remaining\r\nto the DeWitts).<sup> (1)</sup>  After a jury trial, the judge declared the DeWitts to have prevailed,\r\ndetailed the contours of the paragraph 6(3) conveyance, and assessed attorney's fees\r\nagainst Shore, individually.  Shore and his son, Brenham<sup> (2)</sup> (collectively, the Shores) appeal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores, jointly, raise one issue:  lack of jurisdiction.  Shore, individually, raises\r\nthree additional issues: (1) violation of Rule 301--judgment inconsistent with the pleadings,\r\nevidence, and verdict; (2) improper withdrawal of the surface estate from the jury; and (3)\r\nimproper attorney's fees.  We conclude the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over\r\nthis probate matter and essentially entered a proper declaratory judgment, which requires\r\nonly slight modification.  The trial court erred in assessing fees, and remand on this issue\r\nis required. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND </strong>   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThese parties are before this Court for the third time.<sup> (3)</sup>  The DeWitts' current petition\r\nsought partition, accounting, and distribution of the estate; a declaratory judgment to\r\nconstrue the will; and removal of Shore as the independent executor.  The DeWitts sought\r\na declaration (1) that nothing passed under paragraph 6(3); or, alternatively, (2) \"describing\r\nthe interest which passes pursuant to paragraphs [sic] 6(3)\" and which interest(s) through\r\nthe residuary.  More than a year after the DeWitts' application, Shore executed and filed\r\nan executor's deed consistent with his construction of paragraph 6(3).  The same day,\r\nShore filed an application for discharge and \"Verified Final Accounting,\" claiming full\r\nadministration of the estate.  The trial court then ordered, in an agreed temporary\r\ninjunction, that Shore and the DeWitts refrain from taking further action on the estate\r\nwithout court action.  The DeWitts supplemented their petition to include voiding Shore's\r\nexecutor's deed purporting to convey property pursuant to paragraph 6(3).  The case then\r\nwent to jury trial to determine Bean's intent in paragraph 6(3).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A.\tThe Will Language</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe relevant portions of paragraph 6(3), as amended by two codicils, read:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tRegarding the eighty (80) acres I own in the J. Bennett Survey, I give\r\na life estate to my great-nephews, TOM G. DeWITT, III, JAMES J. DeWITT\r\nand WILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., . . . as life tenants the right to collect, receive,\r\nreceipt for, use, enjoy, possess and consume the income from the gas well\r\non the property . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAt the death of WILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., I bequeath his one-third\r\nshare to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tUpon the death of either TOM G. DeWITT III or JAMES J. DeWITT,\r\nI bequeath his one-third share of the life estate to MARLO ANN DeWITT and\r\nWILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., equally, as a life estate.  Upon the death of the\r\nsurvivor, then I bequeath the entire life estate to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee\r\nsimple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>\tB. \tThe Ambiguity</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the uncontroverted evidence indicated the extent of the estates that Bean\r\nowned and might have contemplated devising under paragraph 6(3).  Back in the 1930s,\r\nBean's parents acquired several properties, totaling 425.59 acres.  In 1972, Bean and her\r\nsiblings partitioned the surface, creating Bean's 77.83-acre surface estate.  The siblings\r\nexpressly excepted the mineral estate from the partition; each sibling still owned a 1/5\r\nundivided interest in the 425.59-acre mineral estate.  At the time she drafted her will in\r\n1995 and at her death in 2000, Bean owned the 77.83-acre surface estate in the Bennett\r\nand Chaddick surveys and the 1/5 undivided interest in the 425.59-acre mineral estate in\r\nthe Bennett, Chaddick, McAnulty, and Ravey surveys.  On questioning by the Shores at\r\ntrial, James DeWitt agreed that the 1/5 interest in the 425.59-acre mineral estate\r\nconstituted a \"mineral estate of 85.1 acres.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores took the position that Bean intended to convey both the surface estate\r\nand the entire mineral estate.  In support, the Shores introduced evidence of other devises\r\nin Bean's will that approximated the acreage of the estates and surveys involved.  The\r\nDeWitts, in support of their position that paragraph 6(3) conveyed only one gas well,\r\nsubmitted evidence of sixteen wells, including one on Bean's 77.83 surface acreage, from\r\nwhich Bean drew income.  The Shores presented evidence that only three of these sixteen\r\nwells were on the 425.59-acre tract, since Bean's interest was pooled.  They also, to refute\r\nthe \"one well\" theory, presented evidence that the well on the 77.83 surface acres was not\r\ndrilled until after both the will and the first codicil (but before the second codicil) were\r\nsigned.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tThe Jury Charge</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores submitted a proposed jury question, denied by the court, that asked\r\nwhether paragraph 6(3) conveyed the mineral interest in the 425.59-acre tract.  Question\r\n2, as initially presented by the court at the charge conference, asked whether Bean\r\nconveyed \"one particular gas well or . . . her undivided mineral interest <em>in the real property.</em>\" \r\n(Emphasis added.)   The Shores did not object to this question.  The DeWitts did object\r\nand asked the court to change \"in the real property\" to \"in the 77.83 acre tract.\"  The\r\nchange essentially removed the Shores' position from the jury's consideration.  The court,\r\non the record, overruled the DeWitts' objection.  The court also ruled that the surface\r\nestate was unambiguously not included in paragraph 6(3).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen the court charged the jury, however, it asked about the surface estate and\r\nincorporated the overruled DeWitts' change to Question 2.  The jury was charged and\r\nanswered as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>QUESTION 1.</strong> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tDo you find that the \"eighty (80) acres I own in the J. Bennett Survey\"\r\nin paragraph 6(3) of the Last Will and Testament of Mary Ann Bean is the\r\n77.83 acre tract owned by Mary Ann Bean at the time of her death?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer \"Yes\" or \"No.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer:  Yes</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf you have answered \"Yes\" to Question 1, then answer the following\r\nquestion.  . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>QUESTION 2.</strong> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tDo you find that Mary Ann Bean intended to convey her interest in one\r\nparticular gas well or her undivided interest in the 77.83 acre tract?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer \"one particular gas well\" or \"her undivided mineral interest.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnswer:  \"her undivided mineral interest.\"<sup> (4)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The judgment declared that paragraph 6(3) conveyed the minerals situated \"in and under\r\nand that may be produced and saved from\" the boundaries of the 77.83-acre surface tract,\r\nwith the remainder of Bean's real property (save that described in two other will paragraphs\r\nnot at issue), including the 77.83-acre surface estate and the remaining 347.76-acre\r\nmineral estate passing to the DeWitts through the residuary. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThough the Shores appear to have properly objected to and preserved error on the\r\njury questions below, they do not raise this error on appeal.<sup> (5)</sup>  Instead, the Shores' appeal\r\nprogresses on the presumption that the jury <em>was</em> asked about Bean's entire undivided\r\nmineral interest (i.e., 77.83 means 1/5 of 425.59). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>II.\tJURISDICTION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A.\tStandard of Review </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law an appellate court\r\nreviews de novo by examining the pleadings and any other evidence relevant to the\r\ndetermination. <em> Tex.

IT-Davy</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1383975\"><a href=\"/opinion/1383975/texas-natural-resource-conserv-v-it-davy/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 855\r\n(Tex. 2002).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores make two jurisdictional challenges.  First, that the court has no\r\njurisdiction to construe a will or order partition and distribution under independent\r\nadministration.  Second, that this particular independent administration was closed at the\r\ntime of the trial, thereby divesting the court of jurisdiction. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B.\tJurisdiction to Construe a Will Under Independent Administration</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have already ruled on the first jurisdictional challenge in this case. <em> See Bean I</em>,\r\n120 S.W.3d at 919 (\"pursuant to the UDJA [Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act], the trial\r\ncourt was not deprived of jurisdiction to construe Bean's will merely because it had\r\nappointed an independent executor\").  The Shores ask us to reconsider that decision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs before, the Shores rely on Section 145(h) of the Texas Probate Code, which\r\nprohibits \"further action of any nature\" in the county court \"except where the Code\r\nspecifically and explicitly provides for some action in the county court.\"<sup> (6)</sup>  Tex. Prob. Code\r\nAnn. § 145(h) (Vernon 2003).  The Shores contend that Section 145(h) requires specific\r\nand explicit reference to only those sections of the Texas Probate Code detailing\r\nindependent administration, yet they provide no authority to support the contention that\r\nSection 145(h)'s reference to \"the code\" actually means \"<em>this chapter of</em> the code.\"  As the\r\nShores' interpretation is unsupported, and is in direct conflict with the actual statutory\r\nlanguage, we are unpersuaded. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSection 5(f) of the Probate Code both specifically and explicitly states:  \"All courts\r\nexercising original probate jurisdiction shall have the power to hear all matters incident to\r\nan estate.\"  Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 5 (Vernon Supp. 2006).<sup> (7)</sup>  Section 5A(a) further\r\nclarifies matters by defining \"incident to an estate\" as including, but not limited to:  \"all\r\nactions for trial of title to land incident to an estate . . . all actions for trial of the right of\r\nproperty incident to an estate, and actions to construe wills, and generally all matters\r\nrelating to the settlement, partition, and distribution of estates of deceased persons.\"  Tex.\r\nProb. Code Ann. § 5A(a) (Vernon Supp. 2006); <em>see also Wallace v. Collins</em>, 988 S.W.d\r\n258, 260 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1998, pet. denied) (\"The trial court has the power to hear\r\nall matters incident to an estate . . . .\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores' cases in support of their argument are inapposite.  This is not a dispute\r\nbetween devisees or legatees and the executor regarding distribution consistent with the\r\nterms of a will. Instead, this is an action to construe the will itself, as a necessary\r\nprerequisite to distribution.  Neither is this a case in which one court does not have\r\njurisdiction because <em>another</em> court does. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores present no authority, and we are aware of none, indicating an\r\nindependent executor's unilateral authority to construe a will.  Neither do the Shores\r\npresent any authority, and we are not aware of any, holding that <em>all</em> courts are divested of\r\nthe power to construe wills under independent administration, as the Shores would have\r\nthis Court hold.  In fact, the Shores' leading case presumes <em>some</em> court's ability to construe\r\na will in an independently administered estate.  <em>See Burke v. Satterfield</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514634\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514634/burke-v-satterfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span>\r\n(Tex. 1975) (holding probate court lacked jurisdiction to enforce a will as it was construed\r\nby a district court). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile court jurisdiction over independently administered estates is limited, it is not\r\neliminated.  <em>See</em> <em>McCaffity v.

Where, as here, the meaning of the will itself is unclear, a court must invoke\r\nits jurisdiction under Sections 5 and 5A of the Texas Probate Code to determine the proper\r\nconstruction of the will.  <em>Accord Estate of Hanau v.

Once the court construes the will, the independent administrator may\r\nthen faithfully execute the will, free of judicial supervision, to effect distribution of the\r\nestate. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the issue was already decided in <em>Bean I</em>, because the Shores present no\r\nauthority in support of the contention that <em>no</em> court has the authority to construe a will, and\r\nbecause the Shores do not contend the trial court was the incorrect court under Sections\r\n5 or 5A, the point of error is accordingly overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tJurisdiction Over a \"Closed\" Estate</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the Shores' second jurisdictional challenge, which they characterize as a question\r\nof mootness, they contend the court had no jurisdiction since the estate was fully\r\nadministered prior to trial.  The Shores claim that the filing, a year into this litigation but\r\nbefore trial, of the executor's deed over the property at issue constituted the final\r\ndistribution of the estate assets (save for allowable reserves and third party royalty checks). \r\nThey contend that, with all debts paid and assets distributed pursuant to Section 149D of\r\nthe Texas Probate Code, Shore, through his application for discharge under Section 149E,\r\nformally announced that the estate was closed. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn support of their position, the Shores cite <em>Wallace v. Collins</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2424940\"><a href=\"/opinion/2424940/wallace-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span> (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 1998, pet. denied), for the proposition that an independent executor's\r\ndistribution of assets immediately and automatically closes an estate, rendering moot all\r\nmatters of administration, including accounting, distribution, and will construction.  The\r\nShores misstate two points of the law in coming to their conclusion.  First, <em>Wallace</em> never\r\nremoved the statutory requirement of a court's acceptance of the independent executor's\r\napplication.  <em>See </em>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 149E(c) (Vernon 2003) (requiring court\r\nadjudication of independent executor's application).  Second,<em> Wallace</em> never goes so far\r\nas to include will construction among those areas of \"administration\" under an independent\r\nexecutor's powers.  Will construction is for the court, not the independent executor (see\r\ndiscussion above).  Since the construction of paragraph 6(3) was a live controversy at the\r\ntime of Shore's executor's deed conveying property under that paragraph, that property\r\nwas never rightfully included among \"property of the estate that remains in the hands of\r\nthe independent executor.\"  <em>See </em>Tex. Prob. Code Ann. § 149D(a) (Vernon 2003).  Indeed,\r\nthe property that Shore purported to convey had been removed from his hands by virtue\r\nof the pending litigation. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditionally, while this litigation was pending, and after Shore filed his application,\r\nthe parties entered into the agreed injunction, essentially deferring to the court on estate\r\nmatters.  The Shores' agreement to this undermines their contention that Shore had\r\nunilaterally removed the estate from the court's jurisdiction.  Considering that the court had\r\naccepted jurisdiction over the construction of the will, signed the agreed temporary\r\ninjunction, and set the will construction matter for trial, the court was within its authority to\r\nnot accept Shore's distribution as appropriate under Section 149D, or his Section 149E\r\napplication as timely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Shores cite <em>In re Estate of Hanau</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1519170\"><a href=\"/opinion/1519170/in-re-estate-of-hanau/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span> (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi\r\n1991, writ denied), for the proposition that an estate is closed on asset distribution and the\r\nindependent executor's filing of a final account, whether or not litigation is pending. <em>Hanau\r\n</em>allowed closing an estate by the independent executor's affidavit under Section 151 of the\r\nTexas Probate Code despite pending litigation.  However, the Legislature amended\r\nSection 151 in 1995, four years after <em>Hanau</em> was decided, to prohibit exactly the situation\r\nencountered in the present matter and approved in <em>Hanau</em>--closing an estate under\r\nSection 151 during pending litigation.  <em>See</em> Act of May 24, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 642,\r\n§ 5, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 3516, 3518.  Section 151 now reads that an independent\r\nadministrator may close an estate by affidavit only \"when there is no pending litigation.\" \r\nTex. Prob. Code Ann. § 151(a) (Vernon 2003).  The evidence is undisputed that Shore\r\nfiled his affidavit to close the estate over a year after this litigation was begun.  His\r\napplication and affidavit may not thus unilaterally defeat the DeWitts' pending applications\r\nunder Section 151.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause litigation was pending, the estate was neither fully administered nor\r\ndischarged, and the estate was not closed under either Section 151 or Section 149E, the\r\nShores' claimed jurisdictional error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>III.\tTEXAS RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 301</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A.\tThe</strong> <strong>Pleadings</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA judgment cannot stand unless it is supported by pleadings and evidence.

The purpose of pleading is\r\nto give the adversary parties notice of each party's claims and defenses, as well as notice\r\nof the relief sought.<em>  Perez v. Briercroft Serv.

In\r\ndetermining whether a cause of action was pleaded, the court must find the plaintiff's\r\npleadings adequate to state, with reasonable certainty and without reference to information\r\nfrom another source, the elements of the cause of action and the relief sought with\r\nsufficient particularity to allow the court to base a judgment. <em>Stoner v.

The judgment does not, however, order\r\npartition.  While partition will now be necessary, the judgment merely construes the will\r\nprovision, as requested in the pleadings.  Partition appears to be left to be accomplished\r\nthrough later distribution of the estate.  As such, the question really is:  Could the pleadings\r\nbe construed to request that only part of the mineral estate pass through paragraph 6(3)? \r\nThe answer is:  Of course.  The DeWitts' application sought a declaration \"describing the\r\ninterest which passes pursuant to paragraphs [sic] 6(3)\" and which interest(s) through the\r\nresiduary.  This put the Shores on notice that the DeWitts sought some or all of the\r\ndisputed property to pass through the residuary.  The very fact of the petition served as\r\nnotice that the DeWitts wanted less than Bean's full ownership to pass via paragraph 6(3).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B.\tThe \"Case Proved\"</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore contends no evidence was submitted on a devise of less than Bean's full\r\nownership interest other than the evidence in support of the one-well theory, which the jury\r\nexpressly rejected.  A jury finding is not based on legally sufficient evidence if:  (a) there\r\nis a complete absence of evidence to support the finding, (b) the court is barred by rules\r\nof law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove the matter\r\nfound, (c) the evidence offered to prove the matter found is no more than a mere scintilla,\r\nor (d) the evidence conclusively establishes a different finding.  <em>See Merrell Dow Pharm.,\r\nInc. v.

A mineral estate must be defined by\r\nboundaries so that it may be located.  <em>See, e.g., Sharp v. Fowler</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2394328\"><a href=\"/opinion/2394328/sharp-v-fowler/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 154 (Tex. 1952).  Although Question 2 references \"the 77.83 acre tract\"\r\nwithout reference to metes and bounds or a more particular description, it does use the\r\ndefinitive article \"the\" and the jury heard evidence referencing one 77.83-acre tract that\r\nsupports its finding.  Moreover, the evidence supports that the 77.83 acres was within the\r\nboundaries of the 425.59 acres.  None of this evidence has been challenged as\r\ninadmissible or unreliable.  As such, more than a scintilla of evidence supports the finding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>C.\tThe Verdict</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is fundamental to our system of jurisprudence that the trial court may not\r\nsubstitute its judgment for that of a jury.  <em>Anthony v.

The trial court's duty, and ours, is to ascertain the\r\nintention of the jury's answers and render a judgment in conformity with them.  <em>See</em> Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 301;<em> State v. Hale</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3960266\"><a href=\"/opinion/4190509/state-v-hale/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3960266\"><a href=\"/opinion/4190509/state-v-hale/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 739 (1941).  Appellate courts\r\nare further mandated to try to interpret jury findings so as to uphold the trial court's\r\njudgment.  <em>See First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n of Dallas v. Sharp</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435521\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435521/first-federal-savings-loan-assn-of-dallas-v-sharp/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span>, 903\r\n(Tex. 1962).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore does not deny that the judgment language almost exactly tracks the language\r\nin Question 2 of the jury's verdict.  Nonetheless, Shore contends that the judgment\r\nincorrectly interprets the meaning of the language.  Shore presents no authority persuading\r\nus that \"in the\" 77.83-acre tract must mean \"associated with\" or \"flowing back to\" the\r\n77.83-acre tract, to use Shore's phrases.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore also contends \"interpreting\" Question 2 as contemplating less than Bean's\r\nfull mineral estate creates an internal inconsistency within Question 2.<sup> (8)</sup>  That is, if the jury\r\nanswered Question 2 \"one well,\" it could have answered Question 3 by naming any one\r\nof the sixteen wells from which Bean received income, only three of which were on the\r\n425.59 acres and only one of which was on the 77.83-acre surface estate.  Shore contends\r\nthat, if Question 2's phrase \"one well\" implicates Bean's full ownership interest, then\r\nQuestion 2's phrase \"undivided mineral interest\" must as well.  The fairness of the phrasing\r\nof the question is not an argument properly made under Rule 301.  The jury was presented\r\nalternate theories of interpretation, one of which asked if Bean intended to convey her\r\nmineral interest in 77.83 acres.  The jury said she did.  The judgment conforms with this\r\nanswer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore further contends an undivided interest in 77.83 acres is no different than the\r\ninterest in the one well on the property--a position rejected by the jury.  However close\r\nthese two choices may be, though, they do differ.  The judgment does not require, as\r\nShore contends, that only minerals physically touching the 77.83-acre surface estate were\r\nconveyed.  Rather, the judgment allows for pooling and full ownership of the mineral estate\r\nas defined by the boundaries of the 77.83-acre surface estate.  The judgment would let the\r\nShores drill 500 wells on those 77.83 acres if they felt so compelled (and were otherwise\r\nnot prohibited).  Meanwhile, Shore presents no authority and points to nothing in the record\r\nin support of the contention that one must convey the full extent of what one owns--i.e.,\r\nthat Bean could convey her interest in the 425.59 acres but nothing less--or that the will\r\ncannot support a construction which conveys less than Bean's full ownership interest. \r\nBecause the entry of judgment is consistent with the pleadings and case proved, and\r\nconforms with the jury's answers to the questions asked, these points of error are\r\noverruled. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>D. \tThe Devisees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore also contends the trial court erred in entering that part of the judgment\r\ndescribing the remainder life estates.  Paragraph 6(3), after providing for William, Tom, and\r\nJames to share a life estate, devises the property as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAt the death of WILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., I bequeath his one-third\r\nshare to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tUpon the death of either TOM G. DeWITT, III or JAMES J. DeWITT\r\nI bequeath his one-third share of the life estate to MARLO ANN DeWITT and\r\nWILLIAM R. SHORE, JR., equally, as a life estate. Upon the death of the\r\nsurvivor, then I bequeath the entire life estate to BRENHAM SHORE, in fee\r\nsimple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The court restated this part of paragraph 6(3) in the judgment as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t1.\t1/3 . . . to Tom G. DeWitt, III, for life with remainder equally to Marlo\r\nAnn DeWitt Senick and William R. Shore for life and with remainder\r\nto Brenham Shore, in fee simple, upon the death of the survivor;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t2.\t1/3 . . . to James Jay DeWitt for life with remainder equally to Marlo\r\nAnn DeWitt Senick and William R. Shore for life and with remainder\r\nto Brenham Shore, in fee simple, upon the death of the survivor; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t3.\t1/3 . . . to William R. Shore for life with remainder to Brenham Shore,\r\nin fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tShore contends the judgment as rendered misstates the remainder life estate in\r\nWilliam and Marlo created at the death of James or Tom.  He further contends this part of\r\nthe judgment serves as a reformation of the devisees not requested in the pleadings.  We\r\nagree with Shore that the will provides that the remainder life estate in William and Marlo\r\nis created at the death of the first of James and Tom and is measured by the survivor of\r\nthe other of James and Tom.  We further agree that the judgment misstates the\r\nunambiguous terms of the will by allowing for two remainder life estates and by measuring\r\nthe remainder life estates by the survivor of Marlo or William. \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor these reasons, and because the DeWitts essentially concede that the judgment\r\nmay require modification on this point, we hereby modify the judgment to provide that: \r\n(1) the numbered paragraphs 1-3 on the unnumbered third page of the declaratory\r\njudgment (as quoted above) are deleted; and (2) the following paragraphs are substituted:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t1.\t1/3 each to Tom G. DeWitt, III, James Jay DeWitt, and William R. Shore, Jr.,\r\nfor life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t2.\tAt the death of William R. Shore, Jr., William R. Shore, Jr.'s, 1/3 share to\r\nBrenham Shore in fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t3.\tAt the death of the first of Tom G. DeWitt, III and James Jay DeWitt, the\r\ndeceased's 1/3 share to Marlo Ann DeWitt Senick and William R. Shore, Jr.,\r\nequally, for the life of the survivor of James Jay DeWitt and Tom G. DeWitt,\r\nIII.  At the death of the second of Tom G. DeWitt, III and James Jay DeWitt,\r\nboth Tom G. DeWitt, III's and James Jay DeWitt's shares to Brenham Shore,\r\nin fee simple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>IV. \tREMOVING THE SURFACE ESTATE FROM THE JURY</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWill construction is only a matter for a jury if the provision at issue is ambiguous as\r\na matter of law.  \"If the court can give a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation\r\nto the words used, the will is unambiguous, and the court should construe it as a matter\r\nof law.\" <em> Steger v. Muenster Drilling Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405463\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405463/steger-v-muenster-drilling-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 373 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth\r\n2003, pet. denied). The trial court ruled as a matter of law that the will was unambiguous\r\nin contemplating only a mineral estate.  Shore contends this was error since (1) evidence\r\nsubmitted supports a different conclusion; and (2) the jury appears, in Question 1, to have\r\nagreed that paragraph 6(3) conveyed a surface estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis extrinsic evidence and alleged verdict are not capable of transforming\r\nunambiguous will language into ambiguous language.  A testator's intent must be\r\ndiscerned from \"the language found within the four corners of the will\" through a careful\r\nexamination of the words used.  <em>San Antonio Area Found. v. Lang</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1575863\"><a href=\"/opinion/1575863/san-antonio-area-foundation-v-lang/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 639\r\n(Tex. 2000).  \"If the will is unambiguous, a court should not go beyond specific terms in\r\nsearch of the testatrix's intent.\"  <em>Id.</em>  Therefore, \"extrinsic evidence applies only when a term\r\nis open to more than one construction.\"  <em>Id.</em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe will reads:  \"[r]egarding the eighty (80) acres . . . I give a life estate . . . to . . .\r\nthe gas well.\"  The language clearly contemplates a mineral estate, but makes no mention\r\nof a surface estate.  Moreover, the will specifies various mineral property rights and is silent\r\non any rights attendant to the surface estate.  Shore contends the use of the phrase \"fee\r\nsimple\" requires (1) a conveyance coextensive with Bean's ownership interests; and (2) a\r\nmerging of the two estates.  We have addressed the former of these contentions above,\r\nand add only that the judgment does convey a fee interest in the land described in\r\nQuestion 2.  As to the latter contention, Shore presents no authority for the proposition that\r\nthe fee conveyance of a severed mineral estate must merge with the fee interest in the\r\nsevered surface estate.  In fact, the merger of a lesser estate into a greater \"is disfavored\r\nin Texas.\"  <em>Steger</em>, 134 S.W.3d at 376.  Merger must not occur when it is \"contrary to the\r\nintention of the owner of the two estates.\"  <em>Id.</em>  The Bean family expressly severed the\r\nsurface and mineral estates in 1972.  While the severance of the estates indicates an\r\nintent against merger, Shore points to no evidence in the record indicating that Bean\r\nintended to merge the estates.  The point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>V.\tATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS OF COURT</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe DeWitts presented evidence of an aggregated fee to the jury.  The evidence\r\nreferenced the community fee norm and the attorney's hourly rate, but did not break down\r\nthe fee to specific tasks or dates.  The jury found that the \"reasonable fee for necessary\r\nservice of Plaintiff's attorney in this case\" was $28,614.17.  The court assessed that fee\r\nagainst Shore, individually.  Shore claims several points of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>A. \tEvidentiary Sufficiency</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tReview of attorney's fees under the UDJA requires a \"multi-faceted review involving\r\nboth evidentiary and discretionary matters.\"  <em>Bocquet v. Herring</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441412\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441412/bocquet-v-herring/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 21 (Tex.\r\n1998).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[I]n reviewing an attorney fee award under the Act [UDJA], the court of\r\nappeals must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by\r\nawarding fees when there was insufficient evidence that the fees were\r\nreasonable and necessary, or when the award was inequitable or unjust. \r\nUnreasonable fees <em>cannot</em> be awarded, even if the court believed them just,\r\nbut the court may conclude that it is not equitable or just to award even\r\nreasonable and necessary fees.  <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em>  \"[T]he Declaratory Judgments Act entrusts attorney fee awards to the trial court's sound\r\ndiscretion, subject to the requirements that any fees awarded be reasonable and\r\nnecessary, which are matters of fact, and to the additional requirements that fees be\r\nequitable and just, which are matters of law.\"  <em>Neely v.

Shore does not dispute that the jury\r\nfound the fees assessed to be reasonable and necessary.  Shore instead asserts that fees\r\nmay only be determined to be reasonable and necessary on a showing and consideration\r\nof each of the eight factors listed in the disciplinary rules.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Disciplinary P.\r\n1.04, <em>reprinted in</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann., tit. 2, subtit. G app. A-1 (Vernon 2005).  The\r\ncaselaw is clear, however, that this list is a <em>guide</em> for the fact-finder.  <em>See, e.g., Bocquet</em>,\r\n972 S.W.2d at 21.  We decline to extend the law to mandate the showing of each of the\r\neight factors as a prerequisite for fee recovery.  This point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>B. \tNonprevailing Parties </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore next contends that the DeWitts, as nonprevailing parties, are not entitled to\r\nfees or costs.  However, nonprevailing parties are allowed to recover fees under the UDJA. \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009  (Vernon 1997) (\"In any proceeding under\r\nthis chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as\r\nare equitable and just.\"); <em>Barshop v. Medina County Underground Water Conservation\r\nDist.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768046\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768046/barshop-v-medina-under-wat-cons-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 637 (Tex. 1996) (\"attorney's fees in declaratory judgment actions\r\nis clearly within the trial court's discretion and is not dependent on a finding that a party\r\n'substantially prevailed'\"); <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Travis</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2336463\"><a href=\"/opinion/2336463/scottsdale-ins-co-v-travis/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 77 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Dallas 2001, pet. denied).  Shore admits as much, but contends that, under the\r\nequity prong of the fee analysis, the award of fees to a nonprevailing party is neither\r\nequitable nor just.  Though Shore presents several cases in which fee awards to \"the\r\nprevailing party\" were remanded for reconsideration when the appellate court reversed on\r\nthe merits, none of these cases requires that a party must prevail as a prerequisite for\r\nrecovery.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Neely</em>, 176 S.W.3d at 799.  The argument that the award of fees to\r\na nonprevailing party is de facto unjust is inconsistent with the explicit language in the\r\nstatute and the caselaw.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoreover, we do not agree that the DeWitts did not prevail.  A prevailing party is\r\n\"one of the parties to a suit who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends\r\nagainst it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent of its original\r\ncontention.\"  <em>City of Amarillo v. Glick</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1533964\"><a href=\"/opinion/1533964/city-of-amarillo-v-glick/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1997, no\r\npet.).  While the DeWitts did not succeed in getting both the surface and mineral estates\r\nto pass through the residuary clause, they did get the court to declare the surface estate\r\nand most of the mineral estate to pass through the residuary clause.  Shore contends the\r\njury answered each question (except for the amount of attorney's fees) against the DeWitts\r\nin favor of the answer for which the Shores argued,  and so the Shores prevailed.  But, as\r\nShakespeare wrote, \"[T]here's small choice in rotten apples.\" Shakespeare, <em>The Taming\r\nof the Shrew</em>, act 1, sc. 1, lines 134-35.  While the jury answered as much in the Shores'\r\nfavor as it could, the jury was never asked to consider the surface estate or the bulk of the\r\nmineral estate, which the trial court had already excised in the DeWitts' favor.  The Shores\r\ndid not prevail, and the point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\tC.\tThe Award Against Shore Individually</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore seeks reversal of the fees assessed against him individually, rather than in\r\nhis capacity as executor.  Essentially, Shore contends the individual award is inequitable\r\nand unjust, noting that the declaration sought to undo certain actions that he had taken as\r\nexecutor and not as an individual.  At trial, the DeWitts addressed Shore only in his\r\nrepresentative capacity.  The DeWitts told the jury that Shore, \"acting as executor for Mary\r\nAnn Bean, made a deed.  And that deed doesn't look like this will\" and that \"that's why\r\nwe're here.\"  The DeWitts continued that \"we need to hold this executor to the terms of the\r\nwill under which he is serving.\"  It does seem to be both inequitable and unjust, as those\r\nterms are used colloquially, to assess fees against Shore, individually.  But the colloquial\r\nuse of the words is not at issue.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe DeWitts assert that Shore waived this issue on appeal by not objecting to the\r\ncapacity under which fees were sought at trial.  We agree.  Failing to obtain a ruling on his\r\nindividual liability in the trial court, the issue was within the trial court's discretion \"to assess\r\nattorney's fees against any or all parties.\"  <em>46933, Inc. v.

Aquamarine Operators, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436853\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436853/downer-v-aquamarine-operators-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span> (Tex. 1985); <em>Beaumont Bank,\r\nN.A. v.

The fact that Shore did appear both as\r\nthe executor and as an individual provides support for the award against him individually. \r\nBecause the trial court acted within its discretion in assessing the fees against Shore as\r\none of the named parties, this point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>D. \tSegregation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Shore contends the fee award was in error for failure to segregate the fees\r\nbetween parties and causes.  A party seeking to recover attorney's fees must segregate\r\nthose fees attributable to different parties or causes, except \"when the attorney's fees\r\nrendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are so\r\ninterrelated that their 'prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same\r\nfacts.'\"  <em>Stewart Title Guar.

App.--Dallas\r\n1987, writ denied)).  On a finding that the fees are capable of segregation, this Court must\r\nremand the fee issue to the trial court.  <em>Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 12.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\t1. \tSeparate Parties</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore contends the DeWitts' failure to segregate fees between defendants\r\nconstituted reversible error.  \"[I]n order to show the reasonableness and necessity of\r\nattorney's fees, the plaintiff is required to show that the fees were incurred while suing the\r\ndefendant sought to be charged . . . .\"  <em>Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 10.  <em>Sterling</em> does not\r\nextend as far as Shore would have it--i.e., that, in all cases with multiple defendants, fees\r\n<em>must</em> be segregated.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>AU Pharm., Inc. v. Boston</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428988\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428988/au-pharmaceutical-inc-v-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span>, 337 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 1999, no pet.) (action against Ivy and AU on same claim need not be\r\nsegregated where interests the same).  Shore fails to indicate any way in which any\r\ndefendant's interest diverges from another's so as to render fees against one unattributable\r\nagainst another.  The pleadings indicate that Shore answered with the same position both\r\nindividually and as executor<sup> (9)</sup> and that Brenham made no answer, though his mother did\r\nappear as his guardian at trial.<sup> (10)</sup>  It is not unreasonable or an abuse to not segregate\r\nbetween nondivergent defendants.  <em>See Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 11.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\t2.\tSeparate Causes</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Attorney's fees incurred in defending a separate lawsuit cannot be recovered under\r\nsection 37.009 of the Act, notwithstanding that the separate lawsuit concerned the same\r\nissues as those in the declaratory judgment suit.\"  <em>Dalisa, Inc. v.

App.--Austin 2002, no pet.).  Shore contends the fees incurred in <em>Bean I\r\n</em>were improperly not segregated from fees incurred after the filing of the petition in this suit\r\nin December 2003.  The DeWitts admit that the evidence on fees submitted to the jury\r\nwent back to work from 2001, during the prior suit and unsuccessful appeal, but contend\r\nthat the current petition is a mere \"amendment\" of the prior one.  We disagree.  Because\r\nthe 2001 declaratory judgment action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in the trial court,\r\nit may not be \"amended.\"  That the cause number is the same in both suits is irrelevant\r\nsince the cause number under which both actions--that from 2001 and the current one\r\ninitiated in 2003--were docketed is actually the cause assigned to the probate of Bean's\r\nestate, and not exclusive to any particular petition on that estate.  To this end, the DeWitts\r\nare not, in this declaratory judgment action, entitled to fees from the 2001 lawsuit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShore also contends the fees were not segregated between different causes of\r\naction filed since 2003.  Shore asserts that fees are only available for work done on the\r\ndeclaratory judgment and not the petitions for an accounting and distribution and for the\r\nremoval of Shore as executor.  The DeWitts' attorney, in submitting his evidence of fees\r\nat trial, stated that  he \"went through and omitted from our bill things that I saw that did not\r\nrelate to the declaratory judgment action.\"  However, in the DeWitts' \"Supplemental Petition\r\nfor Declaratory Judgment,\" submitted days before trial, the DeWitts sought \"all relief\r\nrequested in other active pleadings which are presently on file\" and \"such other and further\r\nrelief to which Plaintiff / Applicants may be justly entitled and for which they will ever pray.\" \r\nThis would seem to include, under the banner of \"work on the declaratory judgment,\" work\r\non all pleadings in the case, including the removal of the executor and for an accounting\r\nand distribution.  The declaratory judgment rendered does not purport, however, to\r\ndistribute the estate, require a final accounting, or remove the executor.<sup> (11)</sup>  The broad\r\nprayer for relief in the DeWitts' supplemental application requires segregation between the\r\ncauses of action beyond the trial assertion that things that did not \"relate\" were segregated. \r\nThe DeWitts are entitled to, at most, those fees attributable to will construction and quiet\r\ntitle since the December 2003 petition.  Accordingly, Shore's contention in this regard is\r\nsustained.<strong>VI.\tCONCLUSION </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat part of the judgment regarding attorney's fees is reversed and remanded for trial\r\nconsistent with this opinion.

This Court also\r\nrejected Shore's contention that the court lacks jurisdiction to construe a will under\r\nindependent administration, an issue Shore raises again in this appeal (see discussion\r\nbelow).\r\n<p>4. The jury did not answer Question 3, naming a particular \"well on the property,\"\r\nsince it had answered Question 2 as an \"undivided interest.\"  Question 4 determined the\r\namount of attorney's fees (see discussion below).\r\n</p><p>5. The Shores would seem to present the issue for review as \"Issues Presented,\"\r\nissue 3:  \"[m]ay a trial court refuse to charge a jury with issues raised by the pleadings and\r\npresented to the jury in the evidence . . . ?\"  However, in the body of the brief, it is obvious\r\nthat this issue only covers the surface estate.  For an issue to be properly before this Court,\r\nthe issue must be supported by argument and authorities and must contain appropriate\r\ncitations to the record.  <em>See </em>Tex. R.

App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied). \r\n</p><p>6. The Shores contend that this Court \"added a phrase\" into Section 145(h) in <em>Bean I</em>\r\nby allowing reference to other codes.  While this Court did find that the UDJA conferred\r\njurisdiction, the decision did not misstate the statute.  The court has jurisdiction to construe\r\nwills under Sections 5 and 5A of the Texas Probate Code.  That will construction is\r\naccomplished via an action under the UDJA is irrelevant, since such an action is made\r\npursuant to the authority under Section 5A of the Texas Probate Code.\r\n</p><p>7. We are aware that Sections 5 and 5A of the Texas Probate Code were amended\r\nin 2003.  The particular language we address was not changed.  Since our analysis is not\r\naffected, we cite the current version for your convenience.\r\n</p><p>8. This is not an argument that the jury's answers to different questions are\r\nirreconcilable. Rather, under the guise of Rule 301, it seems to be a challenge to the\r\ncourt's ability to enter judgment on a jury question now seen as \"unfair.\"\r\n</p><p>9. The DeWitts served the original petition on Shore, through his attorney, as\r\nindependent executor, individually, and guardian of Brenham.  Shore's pleadings refer to\r\nShore as \"the Independent Executor and one of the defendants.\"\r\n</p><p>10. This Court previously recognized that \"Brenham Shore's interest under the will is\r\nconsistent with that of his father, i.e., however goes Shore's interest, so goes that of\r\nBrenham Shore.\"  <em>Bean I</em>, 120 S.W.3d at 921.\r\n</p><p>11. Shore refers to himself in his pleadings to this Court and in his trial court motion\r\nfor a judgment notwithstanding the verdict as the \"former independent executor.\"  Other\r\nthan his pleadings which so assert, there is no evidence in the record on appeal of his\r\nremoval or discharge as independent executor. \r\n</p></span></p>\r\n</div>",
