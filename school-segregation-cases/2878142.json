Webb appeals from a final order entered in the District Court1 for the\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Richard H. Battey, Chief Judge, United States District Court\nfor the District of South Dakota.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fDistrict of South Dakota granting summary judgment in favor of defendants Lawrence\nCounty, Charles Crotty, the sheriff of Lawrence County, and John Doe and Jim Doe,\nemployees of the sheriff’s department (collectively defendants), on his 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nprisoner civil rights claim alleging an Eighth Amendment violation and dismissing his\npendent state negligence claim. Webb v. Lawrence County, 950 F. Supp. 960 (D.S.D.\n1996) (memorandum opinion and order). For reversal, Webb argues the district court\nerred in (1) holding defendants were not deliberately indifferent to his safety as a matter\nof law (count I) and (2) dismissing his state negligence claim on the ground of sovereign\nimmunity (count II). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n       The district court had subject matter jurisdiction of this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil\nrights action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343. The district court also had supplemental\njurisdiction over the pendent state negligence claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. (In\naddition, there was an independent jurisdictional basis-- diversity of citizenship under\n28 U.S.C. § 1332-- for the state negligence claim.) The notice of appeal was timely\nfiled pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1), and this court has appellate jurisdiction under\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n        The following statement of facts is taken in large part from the memorandum\nopinion and order of the district court. Webb and an accomplice committed various\ncrimes in South Dakota and Wyoming. After Webb was apprehended, he spent several\nmonths in jail in Wyoming, and in October 1993 he was transferred to the Lawrence\nCounty jail to face the pending South Dakota charges. He was placed in maximum\nsecurity. At the time Webb was 19 years old, about 5’4” tall and weighed about 120\npounds. Defendants did not place him in one of two minimum security sections in the\njail because they wanted to separate him from his accomplice (the accomplice had been\nplaced in one of two minimum security sections) and because the other minimum\nsecurity section was full. Initially, Webb shared a cell with another inmate. Then Webb\nmoved into a cell with Greg Wyman, another maximum security inmate.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fApparently Webb’s first cellmate was leaving the jail and Webb did not want to share\na cell with incoming federal prisoners. Defendants knew that Wyman had been\nconvicted of sex offenses, specifically, rape and sexual contact with a minor.\n\n        At night the maximum security cells are locked down. During the day the inmates\ncan move around in the commons area. There is an emergency alarm button located in\nthe commons area, but the alarm is not accessible when the cells are locked down at\nnight. There is also a security surveillance camera in the maximum security section, but\nthe camera does not provide a view inside the individual cells. Defendants stated that\njailers checked the cells every 30 minutes; however, Webb stated that jailers only came\ninto the cell block once a day.\n\n        Webb alleged that Wyman sexually assaulted him repeatedly. Webb did not tell\nanyone about the assaults because he believed Wyman had a knife and he was afraid\nWyman would retaliate against him. After four days, Webb managed to leave a note in\nthe cell bars just before lockdown informing the jailers that he had been sexually\nassaulted. Webb did not notify the jailers sooner because he could not think of a way\nto give them the note without alerting Wyman. Thirty minutes after discovering the note,\nthe jailers moved Webb out of the cell.\n\n        In December 1994 Webb filed this civil rights action in federal district court\nagainst defendants alleging violations of his constitutional rights and state tort law. He\nalleged defendants demonstrated a reckless disregard for his constitutional rights by\nfailing to protect him from inmate violence in violation of the Eighth Amendment (count\nI). He alleged defendants transferred him to Wyman’s cell even though they knew\nWyman was a sexual predator, failed to properly supervise the cell block, failed to\ndevelop adequate protection or policies to minimize or eliminate inmate sexual assaults,\nfailed to stop double-celling inmates, and failed to adequately classify and segregate\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\finmates. In his pendent state tort claim,2 Webb alleged essentially the same acts and\nomissions as those alleged in his constitutional claim. He specifically alleged that\ndefendants failed to adequately protect him from inmate sexual assault, despite his\nobvious vulnerability to such assault because of his youth, physical size, and status as\na new admittee to the jail.\n\n        Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on count I and a motion to\ndismiss count II for failure to state a claim. The district court granted summary judgment\nin favor of defendants on the constitutional claim (count I) because Webb failed to\npresent any evidence that defendants had reason to suspect that inmates in the jail faced\na substantial risk of sexual assault from other inmates. 950 F. Supp. at 965 (noting that\nalthough inmate rape and assault is pervasive in nation’s prison system, pervasiveness\nis not sufficient to put defendants on notice of excessive risk of serious harm in absence\nof evidence or allegations that inmate rape was common occurrence in this jail). The\ndistrict court also dismissed the state negligence claim (count II) because defendants\nwere protected by sovereign immunity. Id. at 967. The district court held that the\ncounty had not waived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability insurance. Id. The\ndistrict court also held that federal law did not preempt the sovereign immunity defense\nand that sovereign immunity did not deny a judicial remedy in violation of the state\nconstitution’s open courts provision, S.D. Const. art. VI, § 20, because Webb could file\na 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights action. 950 F. Supp. at 967. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        The district court noted that there was also an independent jurisdictional basis\nfor count II-- diversity of citizenship-- and applied South Dakota law to the negligence\nclaim. 950 F. Supp. at 966.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fEIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\n\n       Webb first argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor\nof defendants on his constitutional claim (count I) because there was no evidence that\ndefendants were deliberately indifferent to his safety as a matter of law. He argues that\nthere was circumstantial evidence of a substantial risk of serious harm because\ndefendants knew that Wyman was a sexual predator who obviously posed a substantial\nrisk of serious harm especially to young and physically slight inmates. Webb argues\ndefendants disregarded that obvious risk and thus failed to protect him from inmate\nassault. We disagree.\n\n        We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. The question before the\ndistrict court, and this court on appeal, is whether the record, when viewed in the light\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying “those portions\nof ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any,’ which it believes demonstrate the absence of a\ngenuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). Once the moving party has met this burden, the\nnon-moving party cannot simply rest on mere denials or allegations in the pleadings;\nrather, the non-movant “must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue\nfor trial.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. at 324. Although we\nview the facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, in order to defeat a\nmotion for summary judgment, the non-movant cannot simply create a factual dispute;\nrather, there must be a genuine dispute over those facts that could actually affect the\noutcome of the lawsuit.\n\n    Webb’s constitutional claim is based on an alleged violation of his Eighth\nAmendment rights.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f             The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n      proscribes the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments.” The\n      Supreme Court counsels that this amendment imposes upon prison\n      officials the duty to “provide humane conditions of confinement.” That\n      duty, among other things, requires those officials to take reasonable\n      measures to “protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other\n      prisoners.” The Eighth Amendment imposes this duty because being\n      subjected to violent assaults is not “part of the penalty that criminal\n      offenders pay for their offenses.”\n\n              In order to prevail on an Eighth Amendment failure-to-protect\n      claim, [an inmate] must make two showings. First, [the inmate] must\n      demonstrate that [he or she is] “incarcerated under conditions posing a\n      substantial risk of serious harm.” The second requirement concerns the\n      state of mind of the prison official who is being sued. It mandates that the\n      [inmate] show that the official “knows of and disregards an excessive risk\n      to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from\n      which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\n      exists, and [the official] must also draw the inference.” This subjective\n      requirement is necessary because “only the unnecessary and wanton\n      infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment.”\n\n\nJensen v. Clarke, 73 F.3d 808, 810 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\n825 (1994); other citations omitted); see also Erickson v. Holloway, 77 F.3d 1078,\n1080 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n      We agree with the district court that Webb failed to create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact under Farmer v. Brennan’s subjective knowledge standard. There was no\nevidence that defendants actually knew that Wyman posed a substantial risk of harm\nto Webb. Although defendants knew that, in general, inmate rape and assault is\npervasive in this nation’s prison system, there was no evidence or allegations that\ninmate rape is a common occurrence in this particular jail. Although defendants knew\nthat Wyman was a sexual offender, there was no evidence that Wyman had assaulted\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fany other inmates or caused any problems while incarcerated. Defendants also knew\nthat Webb had requested Wyman as a cellmate. Defendants were not aware of\nWyman’s threats or assaults because Webb did not report them; however, once they\nlearned of the assaults, they immediately moved Webb out of the cell.\n\n        We also agree with the district court that defendants’ knowledge was insufficient\nto satisfy the lesser objective knowledge standard this circuit applied in prisoner assault\ncases before Farmer v. Brennan. Cf. Falls v. Nesbitt, 966 F.2d 375, 379 & n.5 (8th Cir.\n1992) (noting in pre-Farmer v. Brennan case that a single episode of violence, without\nwarning or suspicion, is insufficient to establish a pervasive risk of harm, particularly\nwhen plaintiff views attack as an isolated incident). Even assuming for purposes of\nanalysis that the risk of sexual assault faced by young, physically slight inmates like\nWebb was obvious, and thus sufficient to put defendants on notice of its existence,\n“Farmer [v. Brennan] specifically rejects the idea that liability may be found when a\nrisk is so ‘obvious that is should [have been] known.’” Jensen v. Clarke, 73 F.3d at\n811, citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at 836.\n\nSTATE NEGLIGENCE CLAIM\n\n       Webb next argues the district court erred in dismissing his state negligence claim\n(count II) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6). Rule 12(b)(6) motions must be read in light of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), which\nrequires “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” The issue is whether, taking all well-pleaded factual allegations in the\ncomplaint to be true, the complaint states a claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief\nagainst the defendants under some set of facts.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, defendants argue the waiver of sovereign immunity\nissue has not been preserved for appellate review. However, Webb raised the issue in\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fthe district court in his brief in response to defendants’ motion for judgment on the\npleadings on count II. Appellant’s Appendix at 41-42.\n\n       Defendants argued in the district court that sovereign immunity barred Webb’s\nstate negligence claim, citing S.D. Codified Laws §§ 3-21-8, 3-21-9 and 3-21-10\n(Michie 1994).3 Webb argued that defendants waived sovereign immunity by\npurchasing liability insurance, citing S.D. Codified Laws §§ 21–32–15, 21-32-16\n(Michie 1987).4 The district court held the fact that the county had purchased liability\n\n\n       3\n        S.D. Codified Laws § 3-21-8 (Michie 1994) provides: “No person, political\nsubdivision or the state is liable for failure to provide a prison, jail or penal or\ncorrectional facility, or if such facility is provided, for failure to provide sufficient\nequipment, personnel, programs, facilities or services in a prison or other correctional\nfacility.”\n\n         S.D. Codified Laws § 3-21-9 (Michie 1994) provides in part that “[n]o person,\npolitical subdivision or the state is liable . . . for any injury caused by or resulting from\n. . . (4) a prisoner to any other prisoner; or (5) services or programs administered by or\non behalf of the prison, jail or correctional facility.”\n\n       S.D. Codified Laws § 3-21-10 (Michie 1994) provides: “No waiver of state\nimmunity by statute or, where permitted, by any officer or agent of the state may\nconstitute or be interpreted as a waiver of the state’s immunity from lawsuits in federal\ncourt.”\n       4\n         S.D. Codified Laws § 21-32-15 (Michie 1987) provides: “The state of South\nDakota, through the commissioner of administration, may obtain and pay for public\nliability insurance to the extent and for the purposes considered expedient by the\ncommissioner for the purpose of insuring the liability of the state, its officers, agents\nor employees.”\n\n       S.D. Codified Laws § 21-32-16 (Michie 1987) provides:\n\n             To the extent such liability insurance is purchased pursuant to\n       § 21-32-15 and to the extent coverage is afforded thereunder, the state\n                                             -9-\n\finsurance did not operate as a waiver of sovereign immunity because S.D. Codified\nLaws §§ 21-32-15 and 21–32-16 applied only to the state and not to state agencies or\ncounties. 950 F. Supp. at 967, citing Siefkes v. Watertown Title Co., 437 N.W.2d 190,\n193 (S.D. 1989) (Siefkes) (holding county’s purchase of liability insurance did not\noperate as waiver of sovereign immunity). For the reasons discussed below, we hold\nSiefkes does not apply and that the county waived sovereign immunity by participating\nin a risk sharing pool or purchasing liability insurance. We agree with the district court\nthat Webb failed to state a claim as a matter of law because S.D. Codified Laws\n§ 3-21-9 provided defendants with a complete defense to his state negligence claim.\n\n        In Siefkes the principal controversy involved the record title to an alfalfa field,\nspecifically the existence of a right of way easement over either or both the east and\nwest parts of the field. In the first action the owner of the east part (Siefkes) sued the\ntitle company and its surety for damages, alleging that his property was encumbered by\nthe easement which was not shown by any entry in the abstract of title prepared and\ncertified by the title company. The title company then brought a third party action\nagainst the county register of deeds seeking indemnity for negligent indexing. The state\ntrial court directed the owner of the west part (Herzog) be joined as a real party in\ninterest. The title company filed a third party action against Herzog. Siefkes then\namended his complaint to seek a declaratory judgment that the west easement existed\nand the east easement did not. Herzog then filed a third party action against the title\ncompany for failure to include the west easement in the abstract of title prepared and\ncertified by the title company and against the former owners of the west part. The title\ncompany also filed a third party action against the county register of deeds alleging that\nthe west easement was also not indexed.\n\n\n\n\n      shall be deemed to have waived the common law doctrine of sovereign\n      immunity and consented to suit in the same manner that any other party\n      may be sued.\n                                           -10-\n\f       After reviewing in detail the various property transfers, the court identified two\ndistinct actions for negligence against the title company-- Siefkes’s claim involving the\nfailure to properly abstract the reciprocal easement from Roger to Gary Stenzel\nshowing the existence of the east easement and Herzog’s claim involving the failure to\nproperly abstract the Stenzels-Siefkes deed so as to show the existence of the west\neasement. The state trial court found that the doctrine of merger had eliminated the east\neasement but that the west easement was valid. On appeal, the state supreme court\naffirmed the state trial court’s decision on the existence or non-existence of the\neasements.\n\n        The court then examined the question which is at issue in the present case, that\nis, whether the county had waived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability\ninsurance. Sovereign immunity applies to political subdivisions of the state, such as\ncounties, townships and school districts. The title company argued that the county,\nacting as an agent of the state, waived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability\ninsurance pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws §§ 21-32-15, -16. As noted in the margin,\n§ 21-32-15 provides that the state may obtain liability insurance for the state, its\nofficers, agents, and employees; § 21-32-16 provides that to the extent that such\nliability insurance is purchased, the state shall be deemed to have waived sovereign\nimmunity. The court noted that it had narrowly construed provisions waiving sovereign\nimmunity and held that the fact that the county had purchased liability insurance did not\noperate to waive sovereign immunity under provisions deeming the state to have\nwaived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability insurance. 437 N.W.2d at 193,\nciting Holland v. Yankton School District No. 63-3, 375 N.W.2d 199, 199-200 (S.D.\n1985) (holding that although school districts are state agencies, the state by purchasing\nliability coverage for its officers, agents and employees did not waive sovereign\nimmunity on behalf of school districts), and Zens v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &\nPacific R.R., 386 N.W.2d 475 (S.D. 1986) (holding township did not waive sovereign\nimmunity by purchasing liability insurance).\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f      The court acknowledged in a footnote that the legislature had enacted S.D.\nCodified Laws § 21-32A,5 covering the purchase of liability insurance by any public\n\n\n  5\n   5S.D. Codified Laws ch. 21-32A (Michie 1987) provides:\n\n              21-32A-1. Waiver of sovereign immunity to extent of risk\n      sharing pool or insurance coverage. To the extent that any public\n      entity, other than the state, participates in a risk sharing pool or purchases\n      liability insurance and to the extent that coverage is afforded thereunder,\n      the public entity shall be deemed to have waived the common law\n      doctrine of sovereign immunity and shall be deemed to have consented to\n      suit in the same manner that any other party may be sued. The waiver\n      contained in this section and §§ 21-32A-2 and 21-32A-3 is subject to the\n      provisions of § 3–22–17.\n\n             21-32A-2. Immunity of employees, officers or agents--\n      Affirmative defense. Except insofar as a public entity participates in a\n      risk sharing pool or insurance is purchased pursuant to § 21-32A-1, any\n      employee, officer or agent of the public entity, while acting within the\n      scope of his employment or agency, whether such acts are ministerial or\n      discretionary, is immune from suit or liability for damages brought against\n      him in either his individual or official capacity. The immunity recognized\n      herein may be raised by way of affirmative defense.\n\n            21-32A-3. Immunity of public entities-- Affirmative defense.\n      Except insofar as a public entity participates in a risk sharing pool or\n      insurance is purchased pursuant to § 21-32A-1, any public entity is\n      immune from liability for damages whether the function in which it is\n      involved is governmental or proprietary. The immunity recognized herein\n      may be raised by way of affirmative defense.\n\n      Section 3-22-17 (Michie 1994) provides in part:\n\n             Nothing in this chapter may be construed to be in conflict with or\n      to expand the scope of governmental or sovereign immunity or any waiver\n      of governmental or sovereign immunity contained in the state\n                                          -12-\n\fentity, other than the state, but did not apply it because the provision went into effect\non July 1, 1986, well after all the property transfers occurred, and had no retroactive\neffect. 437 N.W.2d at 103 n.3; see Ritter v. Johnson, 465 N.W.2d 196, 198 n.3 (S.D.\n1991) (refusing to reach constitutionality of waiver provision because it did not go into\neffect until after accident at issue and has no retroactive effect). Counties are included\nin the statutory definition of the term “public entities.” S.D. Codified Laws\n§ 3-22-2(12) (Michie Supp. 1997). Unlike Siefkes, this provision was in effect at the\ntime when Webb was assaulted by Wyman in jail and therefore does apply in the\npresent case.\n\n        Brown v. Egan Consolidated School District No. 50-2, 449 N.W.2d 259, 262\n(S.D. 1989) (Brown), shows how § 21-32A-1 operates. That case involved an accident\nthat occurred in January 1988 between the plaintiff (Brown) and a school bus owned\nby the school district and operated by another school district employee. (As noted\nabove, § 21-32A-1 became effective July 1, 1986.) The school district had purchased\nliability insurance. Brown suffered serious injuries and sued the school district to the\nextent of its insurance coverage. The school district court filed a motion for summary\n\n\n      Constitution, statute, judicial opinion, ordinance, resolution or tort claims\n      act except as provided in § 3-22-10 [which refers to payment of claims\n      from the fund] which may be construed only to extend sovereign\n      immunity to the maximum extent allowed under the state or federal\n      constitutions.\n\n        S.D. Codified Laws ch. 3-22, enacted in 1986, established the public entity pool\nfor liability. The state supreme court has presumed that the legislature established the\nfund as a substitute for traditional liability insurance. See Kyllo v. Panzer, 535 N.W.2d\n896, 900 (S.D. 1995) (reviewing history of sovereign immunity legislation following\n1985 decision which upheld as constitutional legislation imposing limitations and\nconditions on the operation of sovereign immunity, but held that the state’s\nparticipation in a risk sharing pool did not waive sovereign immunity because plain\nlanguage of statute required purchase of traditional liability insurance, not\nself-insurance through risk sharing pool).\n                                           -13-\n\fjudgment, claiming that another statute, § 13-29-1, created an independent statutory\nbasis for sovereign immunity that had not been waived by § 21-32A-1. The state trial\ncourt reconciled the two provisions by holding that sovereign immunity still existed\nunder § 13-29-1 but had been waived under § 21-32A-1 to the limit of the liability\ninsurance. On appeal, the school district argued there were three independent bases for\nsovereign immunity-- common law, the state constitution, and particular statutes. The\nschool district court conceded that § 21-32A-1 waived common law and constitutional\nimmunity but argued that it did not waive what it called the “independent statutory\nimmunity” for operation of school buses contained in § 13-29-1, which provided in\npart:\n\n      The school board of any school district may acquire, own, operate, or hire\n      buses for the transportation of students to and from its schools either from\n      within or without the district or for transportation to and from athletic,\n      musical, speech, and other interscholastic contests in which participation\n      is authorized by the school board. If the use of a school bus is granted by\n      the school board pursuant to subdivision (1) or (8) of § 49-28-2\n      [excluding certain motor vehicles from the definition of motor carriers for\n      the purpose of regulation under the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)],\n      the school district is not liable for suit or damages which may arise as the\n      result of the use.\n\n\nSection 49-28-2(1) excludes from PUC regulation motor vehicles used for\ntransportation to and from schools or interscholastic activities or when use is rented or\ngranted to nonprofit organizations for transport of persons under 21 for community\nservice. Section 49-28-2(8) exempts motor vehicles used by nonprofit organizations\nfor transportation of senior citizens or handicapped persons.\n\n      The school district argued the exemption from liability applied to its use of buses\nfor student transportation. The state supreme court disagreed, holding that the\nexemption of liability language did not apply to the school district’s use of buses to\n\n                                          -14-\n\ftransport its own students to and from school or interscholastic contests, but instead\nonly to renting or granting use of the buses to nonprofit organizations for their\npurposes. 449 N.W.2d at 261. The court noted that § 49-28-2(1) limited the area in\nwhich a bus can be used under the grant and further required that the organization to\nwhich use is granted furnish a fully qualified driver and insurance coverage to and no\nless than the limits the school district carried for the usual transportation in connection\nwith school activities. Id. The court thus concluded that the effect of § 13-29-1 was\n“simply to prevent stacking liability coverages where the use of the bus is granted to\nthe nonprofit organizations” and that the “liability aspect” of that section was simply\ninapplicable to the facts of the case. Id.\n\n        The court rejected, without further explanation, the school district’s statutory\nsovereign immunity argument that there are three independent bases for sovereign\nimmunity, with individual statutes such as § 13-29-1 composing the third leg of the\ntriad, that must be specially waived by statute, because it ignored the history of\nsovereign immunity. Id. at 262 (the other two legs being common law and the state\nconstitution). The court explained that “[t]he immunity language of SDCL 13–29–1\ndid nothing more than reiterate the common law concept of sovereign immunity\nembodied in the South Dakota Constitution, art. III, § 27 [,which provides that the\nlegislature shall direct by law in what manner and in what courts suits may be brought\nagainst the state]. . . . It does not create the special variety of sovereign immunity urged\nby [the school district].” Id., citing Celia Miner, Comment, An Analysis of South\nDakota’s Sovereign Immunity Law: Governmental v. Official Immunity, 28 S.D. L.\nRev. 317, 321 (1983) (Comment) (noting case law recognizes “dual common and\nconstitutional law basis” for sovereign immunity); see Kyllo v. Panzer, 535 N.W.2d\n896, 898-900 (S.D. 1995) (reviewing history of personal liability of public employees\nunder sovereign immunity scheme). The court then reviewed the history of sovereign\nimmunity as applied to school districts:\n\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f             For many years, this court held unequivocally that school districts\n      were immune from tort actions because they are state agencies wielding\n      a distributive portion of the sovereign power of the state. . . . After the\n      passage of SDCL 21-32-15 in 1981, it appeared that school districts had\n      waived sovereign immunity if the commissioner of administration\n      purchased liability insurance. But in Holland v. Yankton School Dist.\n      63-3, 375 N.W.2d 199 (S.D. 1985), a case where school district\n      employees spilled hot soup on a student, we held that school districts\n      were not one of the state agencies that was included in the liability\n      coverage purchased by the commissioner of administration and upheld\n      summary judgment in the case because sovereign immunity had not been\n      waived.\n\n             We surmise that the legislature sought to overcome this problem in\n      1986 by authorizing school districts to waive sovereign immunity under\n      the rubric of “public entities.”\n\n             SDCL ch. 3-21, enacted as Chapter 4 of the Session Laws of 1986,\n      is entitled “Liability for Public Entities and Public Officials.” SDCL\n      3-21-1(1) defines public entities. . . . [as] the state of South Dakota, all its\n      branches and agencies, boards and commissions. . . . [and] also includes\n      all public entities established by law exercising any part of the sovereign\n      power of the state, including, but not limited to municipalities, counties,\n      school districts . . . .\n\n\nId. (the public entity definition is now in S.D. Codified Laws § 3-22-2(12) (Michie\nSupp. 1997)). The court held the school district, a public entity, had purchased liability\ninsurance and so had waived its sovereign immunity to the limit of its insurance\ncoverage. Id.\n\n       The present case is similar to Brown except that the public entity is a county\ninstead of a school district. The distinction noted in Siefkes between the purchase of\ninsurance by the state or by the county is not relevant in the present case because\n§ 21-32A applies. Here, the county has either participated in a risk sharing pool or\n\n                                           -16-\n\fpurchased liability insurance coverage. Appellant’s Appendix at 20 (Order for Form\n35) (identifying insurance carrier as South Dakota Public Assistance Alliance). Thus,\npursuant to S.D. Codified Laws §§ 21-32A-1, -2, the county waived sovereign\nimmunity, to the extent that coverage is afforded thereunder, and consented to suit in\nthe same manner that any other party may be sued. See Bland v. Davison County, 566\nN.W.2d 452, 461 n.9 (S.D. 1997) (noting county waived sovereign immunity defense\nby purchasing liability insurance pursuant to § 21-32A-1); id., 507 N.W.2d 80, 82 (S.D.\n1993) (Wuest, J., concurring specially) (holding county waived sovereign immunity to\nextent liability insurance coverage exists).\n\n       However, because we agree with the district court that S.D.Codified Laws\n§ 3-21-9 provided defendants with a complete defense to Webb’s state negligence\nclaim, we affirm the district court’s decision that Webb failed to state a claim for that\nreason.      Section 3-21-9 provides in part that “[n]o person [or] political\nsubdivision . . . is liable . . . for any injury caused by or resulting from . . . a prisoner\nto any other prisoner . . . or . . . services or programs administered by or on behalf of\nthe . . . jail.” Although we have found no definitive construction of this particular\nstatute by the South Dakota courts, case law sometimes refers to this defense as\n“statutory immunity.” See B.W. v. Meade County, 534 N.W.2d 595, 596-97 (S.D.\n1995) (holding “statutory immunity” per state statute protected public officials or\nemployees involved in investigation of child abuse from negligence liability); see also\nMartinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 281-82 (1980) (holding state statute which\ngranted “absolute immunity” from liability for any injury resulting from parole release\ndecisions and thus provided public employees with complete defense to state tort claim\nwas not unconstitutional unless wholly arbitrary or irrational); Davis v. Fulton County,\n90 F.3d 1346, 1354 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding “statutory immunity” per state statute\nprotected sheriff’s department employees from tort liability for claims of negligence\nbrought against them in their official or individual capacity).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\f       “Statutory immunity” is related to sovereign immunity or at least to the concept\nof “official” immunity. See Comment, 28 S.D. L. Rev. at 318, 324-33 (distinguishing\nsovereign immunity meaning “governmental” immunity of state and political\nsubdivisions from “official” immunity afforded public employees sued in representative\ncapacity or for discretionary acts). The terms are confusing. Nonetheless, we do not\nthink the South Dakota Supreme Court would hold that the application of “statutory\nimmunity” in the present case is necessarily inconsistent with Brown’s rejection of “the\nspecial variety of [statutory] sovereign immunity urged by [the school district]” in that\ncase.\n\n        First, unlike Brown, the present case does not involve potentially overlapping\ninsurance coverage. Next, because the court in Brown construed the statute to preclude\nany possible stacking of liability coverage and concluded that the “liability aspect” of\nthe statute was inapplicable, it did not have to construe the “liability aspect” of the\nstatute. 449 N.W.2d at 261 (§ 13-29-1 provided that “[i]f the use of a school bus is\ngranted by the school board pursuant to subdivision (1) or (8) of § 49-28-2 [excluding\ncertain motor vehicles from the definition of motor carriers for the purpose of regulation\nunder the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)], the school district is not liable for suit\nor damages which may arise as the result of the use”). It is precisely the “liability\naspect” of the statute that is at issue in the present case, that is, whether the statute\ngrants immunity from civil liability or provides a complete defense. Even though\n§ 3-21-9 refers to liability (no person is liable for any injury) and § 26-8A-14 expressly\nrefers to immunity (any person is immune from any liability), we think the result is the\nsame-- § 3-21-9 provides defendants with a complete defense as a matter of law. See\nMartinez v. California, 444 U.S. at 280-82 (similar liability language was held to\nprovide a complete defense to state tort claims).\n\n       Finally, construing § 3-21-9 to provide a complete defense to liability for\nnegligence in making jail cell assignments does not conflict with recent South Dakota\n“official” immunity cases. See, e.g., Kyllo v. Panzer, 535 N.W.2d at 901-03 (holding\n\n                                           -18-\n\f§§ 21-32-17, 21-32A-2 unconstitutional in violation of open courts provision so far as\nthey extend sovereign immunity to state employees performing ministerial as opposed\nto discretionary functions; two cases involved ministerial act of operation of motor\nvehicles by state employees); Ritter v. Johnson, 465 N.W.2d at 198-99 (case involved\nministerial act of state employee’s ordering truck driver to weigh station); cf. Dykstra\nv. United States Bureau of Prisons, No. 97-3410, 1998 WL 154458, at *2 (8th Cir.\nApr. 6, 1998) (noting discretionary function exception to waiver of sovereign immunity\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act). “State employees are cloaked in sovereign\nimmunity when performing discretionary acts because ‘such discretionary acts\nparticipate in the state’s sovereign policy-making power.’” Kyllo v. Panzer, 535\nN.W.2d at 902, citing Ritter v. Johnson, 465 N.W.2d at 198. Immunity is critical to\nthe state’s evident public policy of allowing those in charge of jails to make\ndiscretionary decisions about prison administration without fear of tort liability. See\nMartinez v. California, 444 U.S. at 283 n.6 (noting stated purpose of immunity statute\nis to allow parole officials to make determinations of release or parole unfettered by\nany fear of tort liability); B.W. v. Meade County, 534 N.W.2d at 597 (noting immunity\nis critical to state’s public policy of protecting reporting and investigation of child\nabuse without fear of reprisal). Webb does not claim that defendants acted\nintentionally, were not acting within the scope of their authority or performing county\nfunctions, or were performing merely ministerial acts.\n\n       We agree with the district court that the statutory immunity defense applies only\nto defeat a tort claim arising under state law.\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\f    A true copy.\n\n           Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH\nCIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                            -20-\n\f",

For reversal, Webb argues the district court\nerred in (1) holding defendants were not deliberately indifferent to his safety as a matter\nof law (count I) and (2) dismissing his state negligence claim on the ground of sovereign\nimmunity (count II). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n       The district court had subject matter jurisdiction of this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil\nrights action under 28 U.S.C. § 1343. The district court also had supplemental\njurisdiction over the pendent state negligence claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. (In\naddition, there was an independent jurisdictional basis-- diversity of citizenship under\n28 U.S.C. § 1332-- for the state negligence claim.) The notice of appeal was timely\nfiled pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1), and this court has appellate jurisdiction under\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n        The following statement of facts is taken in large part from the memorandum\nopinion and order of the district court. Webb and an accomplice committed various\ncrimes in South Dakota and Wyoming. After Webb was apprehended, he spent several\nmonths in jail in Wyoming, and in October 1993 he was transferred to the Lawrence\nCounty jail to face the pending South Dakota charges. He was placed in maximum\nsecurity. At the time Webb was 19 years old, about 5’4” tall and weighed about 120\npounds. Defendants did not place him in one of two minimum security sections in the\njail because they wanted to separate him from his accomplice (the accomplice had been\nplaced in one of two minimum security sections) and because the other minimum\nsecurity section was full. Initially, Webb shared a cell with another inmate. Then Webb\nmoved into a cell with Greg Wyman, another maximum security inmate.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fApparently Webb’s first cellmate was leaving the jail and Webb did not want to share\na cell with incoming federal prisoners. Defendants knew that Wyman had been\nconvicted of sex offenses, specifically, rape and sexual contact with a minor.\n\n        At night the maximum security cells are locked down. During the day the inmates\ncan move around in the commons area. There is an emergency alarm button located in\nthe commons area, but the alarm is not accessible when the cells are locked down at\nnight. There is also a security surveillance camera in the maximum security section, but\nthe camera does not provide a view inside the individual cells. Defendants stated that\njailers checked the cells every 30 minutes; however, Webb stated that jailers only came\ninto the cell block once a day.\n\n        Webb alleged that Wyman sexually assaulted him repeatedly. Webb did not tell\nanyone about the assaults because he believed Wyman had a knife and he was afraid\nWyman would retaliate against him. After four days, Webb managed to leave a note in\nthe cell bars just before lockdown informing the jailers that he had been sexually\nassaulted. Webb did not notify the jailers sooner because he could not think of a way\nto give them the note without alerting Wyman. Thirty minutes after discovering the note,\nthe jailers moved Webb out of the cell.\n\n        In December 1994 Webb filed this civil rights action in federal district court\nagainst defendants alleging violations of his constitutional rights and state tort law. He\nalleged defendants demonstrated a reckless disregard for his constitutional rights by\nfailing to protect him from inmate violence in violation of the Eighth Amendment (count\nI). He alleged defendants transferred him to Wyman’s cell even though they knew\nWyman was a sexual predator, failed to properly supervise the cell block, failed to\ndevelop adequate protection or policies to minimize or eliminate inmate sexual assaults,\nfailed to stop double-celling inmates, and failed to adequately classify and segregate\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\finmates. In his pendent state tort claim,2 Webb alleged essentially the same acts and\nomissions as those alleged in his constitutional claim. He specifically alleged that\ndefendants failed to adequately protect him from inmate sexual assault, despite his\nobvious vulnerability to such assault because of his youth, physical size, and status as\na new admittee to the jail.\n\n        Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on count I and a motion to\ndismiss count II for failure to state a claim. The district court granted summary judgment\nin favor of defendants on the constitutional claim (count I) because Webb failed to\npresent any evidence that defendants had reason to suspect that inmates in the jail faced\na substantial risk of sexual assault from other inmates. 950 F. Supp. at 965 (noting that\nalthough inmate rape and assault is pervasive in nation’s prison system, pervasiveness\nis not sufficient to put defendants on notice of excessive risk of serious harm in absence\nof evidence or allegations that inmate rape was common occurrence in this jail). The\ndistrict court also dismissed the state negligence claim (count II) because defendants\nwere protected by sovereign immunity. Id. at 967. The district court held that the\ncounty had not waived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability insurance. Id. The\ndistrict court also held that federal law did not preempt the sovereign immunity defense\nand that sovereign immunity did not deny a judicial remedy in violation of the state\nconstitution’s open courts provision, S.D. Const. art. VI, § 20, because Webb could file\na 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights action. 950 F. Supp. at 967. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        The district court noted that there was also an independent jurisdictional basis\nfor count II-- diversity of citizenship-- and applied South Dakota law to the negligence\nclaim. 950 F. Supp. at 966.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fEIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\n\n       Webb first argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor\nof defendants on his constitutional claim (count I) because there was no evidence that\ndefendants were deliberately indifferent to his safety as a matter of law. He argues that\nthere was circumstantial evidence of a substantial risk of serious harm because\ndefendants knew that Wyman was a sexual predator who obviously posed a substantial\nrisk of serious harm especially to young and physically slight inmates. Webb argues\ndefendants disregarded that obvious risk and thus failed to protect him from inmate\nassault. We disagree.\n\n        We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. The question before the\ndistrict court, and this court on appeal, is whether the record, when viewed in the light\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying “those portions\nof ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any,’ which it believes demonstrate the absence of a\ngenuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323 (1986)\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). Once the moving party has met this burden, the\nnon-moving party cannot simply rest on mere denials or allegations in the pleadings;\nrather, the non-movant “must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue\nfor trial.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. at 324. Although we\nview the facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, in order to defeat a\nmotion for summary judgment, the non-movant cannot simply create a factual dispute;\nrather, there must be a genuine dispute over those facts that could actually affect the\noutcome of the lawsuit.\n\n    Webb’s constitutional claim is based on an alleged violation of his Eighth\nAmendment rights.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f             The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n      proscribes the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments.” The\n      Supreme Court counsels that this amendment imposes upon prison\n      officials the duty to “provide humane conditions of confinement.” That\n      duty, among other things, requires those officials to take reasonable\n      measures to “protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other\n      prisoners.” The Eighth Amendment imposes this duty because being\n      subjected to violent assaults is not “part of the penalty that criminal\n      offenders pay for their offenses.”\n\n              In order to prevail on an Eighth Amendment failure-to-protect\n      claim, [an inmate] must make two showings. First, [the inmate] must\n      demonstrate that [he or she is] “incarcerated under conditions posing a\n      substantial risk of serious harm.” The second requirement concerns the\n      state of mind of the prison official who is being sued. It mandates that the\n      [inmate] show that the official “knows of and disregards an excessive risk\n      to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from\n      which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\n      exists, and [the official] must also draw the inference.” This subjective\n      requirement is necessary because “only the unnecessary and wanton\n      infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment.”\n\n\nJensen v. Clarke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710915\"><a href=\"/opinion/710915/jerry-jensen-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 810 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Farmer v.

Brennan’s subjective knowledge standard. There was no\nevidence that defendants actually knew that Wyman posed a substantial risk of harm\nto Webb. Although defendants knew that, in general, inmate rape and assault is\npervasive in this nation’s prison system, there was no evidence or allegations that\ninmate rape is a common occurrence in this particular jail. Although defendants knew\nthat Wyman was a sexual offender, there was no evidence that Wyman had assaulted\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fany other inmates or caused any problems while incarcerated. Defendants also knew\nthat Webb had requested Wyman as a cellmate. Defendants were not aware of\nWyman’s threats or assaults because Webb did not report them; however, once they\nlearned of the assaults, they immediately moved Webb out of the cell.\n\n        We also agree with the district court that defendants’ knowledge was insufficient\nto satisfy the lesser objective knowledge standard this circuit applied in prisoner assault\ncases before Farmer v. Brennan. Cf. Falls v. Nesbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584262\"><a href=\"/opinion/584262/ts-falls-sergeant-cummins-unit-adc-v-john-nesbitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 379 & n.5 (8th Cir.\n1992) (noting in pre-Farmer v. Brennan case that a single episode of violence, without\nwarning or suspicion, is insufficient to establish a pervasive risk of harm, particularly\nwhen plaintiff views attack as an isolated incident). Even assuming for purposes of\nanalysis that the risk of sexual assault faced by young, physically slight inmates like\nWebb was obvious, and thus sufficient to put defendants on notice of its existence,\n“Farmer [v. Brennan] specifically rejects the idea that liability may be found when a\nrisk is so ‘obvious that is should [have been] known.’” Jensen v. Clarke, 73 F.3d at\n811, citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at 836.\n\nSTATE NEGLIGENCE CLAIM\n\n       Webb next argues the district court erred in dismissing his state negligence claim\n(count II) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6). Rule 12(b)(6) motions must be read in light of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), which\nrequires “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” The issue is whether, taking all well-pleaded factual allegations in the\ncomplaint to be true, the complaint states a claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief\nagainst the defendants under some set of facts.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, defendants argue the waiver of sovereign immunity\nissue has not been preserved for appellate review. However, Webb raised the issue in\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fthe district court in his brief in response to defendants’ motion for judgment on the\npleadings on count II. Appellant’s Appendix at 41-42.\n\n       Defendants argued in the district court that sovereign immunity barred Webb’s\nstate negligence claim, citing S.D. Codified Laws §§ 3-21-8, 3-21-9 and 3-21-10\n(Michie 1994).3 Webb argued that defendants waived sovereign immunity by\npurchasing liability insurance, citing S.D. Codified Laws §§ 21–32–15, 21-32-16\n(Michie 1987).4 The district court held the fact that the county had purchased liability\n\n\n       3\n        S.D. Codified Laws § 3-21-8 (Michie 1994) provides: “No person, political\nsubdivision or the state is liable for failure to provide a prison, jail or penal or\ncorrectional facility, or if such facility is provided, for failure to provide sufficient\nequipment, personnel, programs, facilities or services in a prison or other correctional\nfacility.”\n\n         S.D. Codified Laws § 3-21-9 (Michie 1994) provides in part that “[n]o person,\npolitical subdivision or the state is liable . . . for any injury caused by or resulting from\n. . . (4) a prisoner to any other prisoner; or (5) services or programs administered by or\non behalf of the prison, jail or correctional facility.”\n\n       S.D. Codified Laws § 3-21-10 (Michie 1994) provides: “No waiver of state\nimmunity by statute or, where permitted, by any officer or agent of the state may\nconstitute or be interpreted as a waiver of the state’s immunity from lawsuits in federal\ncourt.”\n       4\n         S.D. Codified Laws § 21-32-15 (Michie 1987) provides: “The state of South\nDakota, through the commissioner of administration, may obtain and pay for public\nliability insurance to the extent and for the purposes considered expedient by the\ncommissioner for the purpose of insuring the liability of the state, its officers, agents\nor employees.”\n\n       S.D. Codified Laws § 21-32-16 (Michie 1987) provides:\n\n             To the extent such liability insurance is purchased pursuant to\n       § 21-32-15 and to the extent coverage is afforded thereunder, the state\n                                             -9-\n\finsurance did not operate as a waiver of sovereign immunity because S.D. Codified\nLaws §§ 21-32-15 and 21–32-16 applied only to the state and not to state agencies or\ncounties. 950 F. Supp. at 967, citing Siefkes v. Watertown Title Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n193 (S.D. 1989) (Siefkes) (holding county’s purchase of liability insurance did not\noperate as waiver of sovereign immunity). For the reasons discussed below, we hold\nSiefkes does not apply and that the county waived sovereign immunity by participating\nin a risk sharing pool or purchasing liability insurance. We agree with the district court\nthat Webb failed to state a claim as a matter of law because S.D. Codified Laws\n§ 3-21-9 provided defendants with a complete defense to his state negligence claim.\n\n        In Siefkes the principal controversy involved the record title to an alfalfa field,\nspecifically the existence of a right of way easement over either or both the east and\nwest parts of the field. In the first action the owner of the east part (Siefkes) sued the\ntitle company and its surety for damages, alleging that his property was encumbered by\nthe easement which was not shown by any entry in the abstract of title prepared and\ncertified by the title company. The title company then brought a third party action\nagainst the county register of deeds seeking indemnity for negligent indexing. The state\ntrial court directed the owner of the west part (Herzog) be joined as a real party in\ninterest. The title company filed a third party action against Herzog. Siefkes then\namended his complaint to seek a declaratory judgment that the west easement existed\nand the east easement did not. Herzog then filed a third party action against the title\ncompany for failure to include the west easement in the abstract of title prepared and\ncertified by the title company and against the former owners of the west part. The title\ncompany also filed a third party action against the county register of deeds alleging that\nthe west easement was also not indexed.\n\n\n\n\n      shall be deemed to have waived the common law doctrine of sovereign\n      immunity and consented to suit in the same manner that any other party\n      may be sued.\n                                           -10-\n\f       After reviewing in detail the various property transfers, the court identified two\ndistinct actions for negligence against the title company-- Siefkes’s claim involving the\nfailure to properly abstract the reciprocal easement from Roger to Gary Stenzel\nshowing the existence of the east easement and Herzog’s claim involving the failure to\nproperly abstract the Stenzels-Siefkes deed so as to show the existence of the west\neasement. The state trial court found that the doctrine of merger had eliminated the east\neasement but that the west easement was valid. On appeal, the state supreme court\naffirmed the state trial court’s decision on the existence or non-existence of the\neasements.\n\n        The court then examined the question which is at issue in the present case, that\nis, whether the county had waived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability\ninsurance. Sovereign immunity applies to political subdivisions of the state, such as\ncounties, townships and school districts. The title company argued that the county,\nacting as an agent of the state, waived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability\ninsurance pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws §§ 21-32-15, -16. As noted in the margin,\n§ 21-32-15 provides that the state may obtain liability insurance for the state, its\nofficers, agents, and employees; § 21-32-16 provides that to the extent that such\nliability insurance is purchased, the state shall be deemed to have waived sovereign\nimmunity. The court noted that it had narrowly construed provisions waiving sovereign\nimmunity and held that the fact that the county had purchased liability insurance did not\noperate to waive sovereign immunity under provisions deeming the state to have\nwaived sovereign immunity by purchasing liability insurance. 437 N.W.2d at 193,\nciting Holland v.

The waiver\n      contained in this section and §§ 21-32A-2 and 21-32A-3 is subject to the\n      provisions of § 3–22–17.\n\n             21-32A-2.

The immunity recognized\n      herein may be raised by way of affirmative defense.\n\n            21-32A-3. Immunity of public entities-- Affirmative defense.\n      Except insofar as a public entity participates in a risk sharing pool or\n      insurance is purchased pursuant to § 21-32A-1, any public entity is\n      immune from liability for damages whether the function in which it is\n      involved is governmental or proprietary.

That case involved an accident\nthat occurred in January 1988 between the plaintiff (Brown) and a school bus owned\nby the school district and operated by another school district employee. (As noted\nabove, § 21-32A-1 became effective July 1, 1986.) The school district had purchased\nliability insurance.

Codified Laws ch. 3-22, enacted in 1986, established the public entity pool\nfor liability.

The state trial\ncourt reconciled the two provisions by holding that sovereign immunity still existed\nunder § 13-29-1 but had been waived under § 21-32A-1 to the limit of the liability\ninsurance. On appeal, the school district argued there were three independent bases for\nsovereign immunity-- common law, the state constitution, and particular statutes. The\nschool district court conceded that § 21-32A-1 waived common law and constitutional\nimmunity but argued that it did not waive what it called the “independent statutory\nimmunity” for operation of school buses contained in § 13-29-1, which provided in\npart:\n\n      The school board of any school district may acquire, own, operate, or hire\n      buses for the transportation of students to and from its schools either from\n      within or without the district or for transportation to and from athletic,\n      musical, speech, and other interscholastic contests in which participation\n      is authorized by the school board.

The court noted that § 49-28-2(1) limited the area in\nwhich a bus can be used under the grant and further required that the organization to\nwhich use is granted furnish a fully qualified driver and insurance coverage to and no\nless than the limits the school district carried for the usual transportation in connection\nwith school activities. Id. The court thus concluded that the effect of § 13-29-1 was\n“simply to prevent stacking liability coverages where the use of the bus is granted to\nthe nonprofit organizations” and that the “liability aspect” of that section was simply\ninapplicable to the facts of the case. Id.\n\n        The court rejected, without further explanation, the school district’s statutory\nsovereign immunity argument that there are three independent bases for sovereign\nimmunity, with individual statutes such as § 13-29-1 composing the third leg of the\ntriad, that must be specially waived by statute, because it ignored the history of\nsovereign immunity. Id. at 262 (the other two legs being common law and the state\nconstitution). The court explained that “[t]he immunity language of SDCL 13–29–1\ndid nothing more than reiterate the common law concept of sovereign immunity\nembodied in the South Dakota Constitution, art. III, § 27 [,which provides that the\nlegislature shall direct by law in what manner and in what courts suits may be brought\nagainst the state]. . . . It does not create the special variety of sovereign immunity urged\nby [the school district].” Id., citing Celia Miner, Comment, An Analysis of South\nDakota’s Sovereign Immunity Law: Governmental v.

The court then reviewed the history of sovereign\nimmunity as applied to school districts:\n\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f             For many years, this court held unequivocally that school districts\n      were immune from tort actions because they are state agencies wielding\n      a distributive portion of the sovereign power of the state. . . . After the\n      passage of SDCL 21-32-15 in 1981, it appeared that school districts had\n      waived sovereign immunity if the commissioner of administration\n      purchased liability insurance. But in Holland v. Yankton School Dist.\n      63-3, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D. 1985), a case where school district\n      employees spilled hot soup on a student, we held that school districts\n      were not one of the state agencies that was included in the liability\n      coverage purchased by the commissioner of administration and upheld\n      summary judgment in the case because sovereign immunity had not been\n      waived.\n\n             We surmise that the legislature sought to overcome this problem in\n      1986 by authorizing school districts to waive sovereign immunity under\n      the rubric of “public entities.”\n\n             SDCL ch. 3-21, enacted as Chapter 4 of the Session Laws of 1986,\n      is entitled “Liability for Public Entities and Public Officials.” SDCL\n      3-21-1(1) defines public entities. . . . [as] the state of South Dakota, all its\n      branches and agencies, boards and commissions. . . . [and] also includes\n      all public entities established by law exercising any part of the sovereign\n      power of the state, including, but not limited to municipalities, counties,\n      school districts . . . .\n\n\nId. (the public entity definition is now in S.D. Codified Laws § 3-22-2(12) (Michie\nSupp. 1997)). The court held the school district, a public entity, had purchased liability\ninsurance and so had waived its sovereign immunity to the limit of its insurance\ncoverage. Id.\n\n       The present case is similar to Brown except that the public entity is a county\ninstead of a school district. The distinction noted in Siefkes between the purchase of\ninsurance by the state or by the county is not relevant in the present case because\n§ 21-32A applies. Here, the county has either participated in a risk sharing pool or\n\n                                           -16-\n\fpurchased liability insurance coverage. Appellant’s Appendix at 20 (Order for Form\n35) (identifying insurance carrier as South Dakota Public Assistance Alliance). Thus,\npursuant to S.D. Codified Laws §§ 21-32A-1, -2, the county waived sovereign\nimmunity, to the extent that coverage is afforded thereunder, and consented to suit in\nthe same manner that any other party may be sued.

Section 3-21-9 provides in part that “[n]o person [or] political\nsubdivision . . . is liable . . . for any injury caused by or resulting from . . . a prisoner\nto any other prisoner . . . or . . . services or programs administered by or on behalf of\nthe . . . jail.” Although we have found no definitive construction of this particular\nstatute by the South Dakota courts, case law sometimes refers to this defense as\n“statutory immunity.” See B.W. v.

See Comment, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 318, 324-33 (distinguishing\nsovereign immunity meaning “governmental” immunity of state and political\nsubdivisions from “official” immunity afforded public employees sued in representative\ncapacity or for discretionary acts). The terms are confusing. Nonetheless, we do not\nthink the South Dakota Supreme Court would hold that the application of “statutory\nimmunity” in the present case is necessarily inconsistent with Brown’s rejection of “the\nspecial variety of [statutory] sovereign immunity urged by [the school district]” in that\ncase.\n\n        First, unlike Brown, the present case does not involve potentially overlapping\ninsurance coverage. Next, because the court in Brown construed the statute to preclude\nany possible stacking of liability coverage and concluded that the “liability aspect” of\nthe statute was inapplicable, it did not have to construe the “liability aspect” of the\nstatute. 449 N.W.2d at 261 (§ 13-29-1 provided that “[i]f the use of a school bus is\ngranted by the school board pursuant to subdivision (1) or (8) of § 49-28-2 [excluding\ncertain motor vehicles from the definition of motor carriers for the purpose of regulation\nunder the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)], the school district is not liable for suit\nor damages which may arise as the result of the use”). It is precisely the “liability\naspect” of the statute that is at issue in the present case, that is, whether the statute\ngrants immunity from civil liability or provides a complete defense. Even though\n§ 3-21-9 refers to liability (no person is liable for any injury) and § 26-8A-14 expressly\nrefers to immunity (any person is immune from any liability), we think the result is the\nsame-- § 3-21-9 provides defendants with a complete defense as a matter of law. See\nMartinez v. California, 444 U.S. at 280-82 (similar liability language was held to\nprovide a complete defense to state tort claims).\n\n       Finally, construing § 3-21-9 to provide a complete defense to liability for\nnegligence in making jail cell assignments does not conflict with recent South Dakota\n“official” immunity cases. See, e.g., Kyllo v. Panzer, 535 N.W.2d at 901-03 (holding\n\n                                           -18-\n\f§§ 21-32-17, 21-32A-2 unconstitutional in violation of open courts provision so far as\nthey extend sovereign immunity to state employees performing ministerial as opposed\nto discretionary functions; two cases involved ministerial act of operation of motor\nvehicles by state employees); Ritter v. Johnson, 465 N.W.2d at 198-99 (case involved\nministerial act of state employee’s ordering truck driver to weigh station); cf. Dykstra\nv. United States Bureau of Prisons, No. 97-3410, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">154458</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (8th Cir.\nApr. 6, 1998) (noting discretionary function exception to waiver of sovereign immunity\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act). “State employees are cloaked in sovereign\nimmunity when performing discretionary acts because ‘such discretionary acts\nparticipate in the state’s sovereign policy-making power.’” Kyllo v. Panzer, 535\nN.W.2d at 902, citing Ritter v. Johnson, 465 N.W.2d at 198. Immunity is critical to\nthe state’s evident public policy of allowing those in charge of jails to make\ndiscretionary decisions about prison administration without fear of tort liability. See\nMartinez v. California, 444 U.S. at 283 n.6 (noting stated purpose of immunity statute\nis to allow parole officials to make determinations of release or parole unfettered by\nany fear of tort liability); B.W. v. Meade County, 534 N.W.2d at 597 (noting immunity\nis critical to state’s public policy of protecting reporting and investigation of child\nabuse without fear of reprisal). Webb does not claim that defendants acted\nintentionally, were not acting within the scope of their authority or performing county\nfunctions, or were performing merely ministerial acts.\n\n       We agree with the district court that the statutory immunity defense applies only\nto defeat a tort claim arising under state law.\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\f    A true copy.\n\n           Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH\nCIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                            -20-\n\f</pre>",
