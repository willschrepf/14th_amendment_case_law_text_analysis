(City), uses objective examinations to identify those\n firefighters best qualified for promotion. When the results of such an\n exam to fill vacant lieutenant and captain positions showed that\n white candidates had outperformed minority candidates, a rancorous\n public debate ensued. Confronted with arguments both for and\n against certifying the test results—and threats of a lawsuit either\n way—the City threw out the results based on the statistical racial\n disparity. Petitioners, white and Hispanic firefighters who passed\n the exams but were denied a chance at promotions by the City’s re\n fusal to certify the test results, sued the City and respondent officials,\n alleging that discarding the test results discriminated against them\n based on their race in violation of, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil\n Rights Act of 1964. The defendants responded that had they certified\n the test results, they could have faced Title VII liability for adopting\n a practice having a disparate impact on minority firefighters. The\n District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and\n the Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The City’s action in discarding the tests violated Title VII.\n  Pp. 16–34.\n     (a) Title VII prohibits intentional acts of employment discrimina\n  tion based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, 42 U. S. C.\n  §2000e–2(a)(1) (disparate treatment), as well as policies or practices\n  that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a dispropor\n  tionately adverse effect on minorities, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) (disparate\n  impact). Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of dispa\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–328, Ricci et al. v. DeStefano et al., also on\ncertiorari to the same court.\n\f2                         RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    rate impact, the employer may defend by demonstrating that its\n    policy or practice is “job related for the position in question and con\n    sistent with business necessity.” Ibid. If the employer meets that\n    burden, the plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer\n    refuses to adopt an available alternative practice that has less dispa\n    rate impact and serves the employer’s legitimate needs. §§2000e–\n    2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C). Pp. 17–19.\n       (b) Under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional\n    discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an\n    unintentional, disparate impact, the employer must have a strong\n    basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact li\n    ability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.\n    The Court’s analysis begins with the premise that the City’s actions\n    would violate Title VII’s disparate-treatment prohibition absent some\n    valid defense. All the evidence demonstrates that the City rejected\n    the test results because the higher scoring candidates were white.\n    Without some other justification, this express, race-based decision\n    making is prohibited. The question, therefore, is whether the pur\n    pose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\n    be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. The Court has\n    considered cases similar to the present litigation, but in the context\n    of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Such cases\n    can provide helpful guidance in this statutory context. See Watson v.\n    Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 993. In those cases, the\n    Court held that certain government actions to remedy past racial dis\n    crimination—actions that are themselves based on race—are consti\n    tutional only where there is a “strong basis in evidence” that the re\n    medial actions were necessary. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488\n    U. S. 469, 500; see also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267,\n    277. In announcing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the Wy\n    gant plurality recognized the tension between eliminating segrega\n    tion and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all gov\n    ernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other. 476\n    U. S., at 277. It reasoned that “[e]videntiary support for the conclu\n    sion that remedial action is warranted becomes crucial when the re\n    medial program is challenged in court by nonminority employees.”\n    Ibid. The same interests are at work in the interplay between Title\n    VII’s disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions. Apply\n    ing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to\n    both provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance\n    with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances. It also allows\n    the disparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is consis\n    tent with other Title VII provisions, including the prohibition on ad\n    justing employment-related test scores based on race, see §2000e–\n\f                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n2(l), and the section that expressly protects bona fide promotional ex\nams, see §2000e–2(h). Thus, the Court adopts the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard as a matter of statutory construction in order to\nresolve any conflict between Title VII’s disparate-treatment and dis\nparate-impact provisions. Pp. 19–26.\n   (c) The City’s race-based rejection of the test results cannot satisfy\nthe strong-basis-in-evidence standard. Pp. 26–34.\n      (i) The racial adverse impact in this litigation was significant,\nand petitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a prima\nfacie case of disparate-impact liability. The problem for respondents\nis that such a prima facie case—essentially, a threshold showing of a\nsignificant statistical disparity, Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440,\n446, and nothing more—is far from a strong basis in evidence that\nthe City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the\ntest results. That is because the City could be liable for disparate\nimpact discrimination only if the exams at issue were not job related\nand consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally\nvalid, less discriminatory alternative that served the City’s needs but\nthat the City refused to adopt. §§2000e–2(k)(1)(A), (C). Based on the\nrecord the parties developed through discovery, there is no substan\ntial basis in evidence that the test was deficient in either respect.\nPp. 26–28.\n      (ii) The City’s assertions that the exams at issue were not job re\nlated and consistent with business necessity are blatantly contra\ndicted by the record, which demonstrates the detailed steps taken to\ndevelop and administer the tests and the painstaking analyses of the\nquestions asked to assure their relevance to the captain and lieuten\nant positions. The testimony also shows that complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not specifically ap\nply to firefighting practices in the City were fully addressed, and that\nthe City turned a blind eye to evidence supporting the exams’ valid\nity. Pp. 28–29.\n      (iii) Respondents also lack a strong basis in evidence showing an\nequally valid, less discriminatory testing alternative that the City, by\ncertifying the test results, would necessarily have refused to adopt.\nRespondents’ three arguments to the contrary all fail. First, respon\ndents refer to testimony that a different composite-score calculation\nwould have allowed the City to consider black candidates for then\nopen positions, but they have produced no evidence to show that the\ncandidate weighting actually used was indeed arbitrary, or that the\ndifferent weighting would be an equally valid way to determine\nwhether candidates are qualified for promotions. Second, respon\ndents argue that the City could have adopted a different interpreta\ntion of its charter provision limiting promotions to the highest scoring\n\f4                         RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    applicants, and that the interpretation would have produced less dis\n    criminatory results; but respondents’ approach would have violated\n    Title VII’s prohibition of race-based adjustment of test results,\n    §2000e–2(l). Third, testimony asserting that the use of an assess\n    ment center to evaluate candidates’ behavior in typical job tasks\n    would have had less adverse impact than written exams does not aid\n    respondents, as it is contradicted by other statements in the record\n    indicating that the City could not have used assessment centers for\n    the exams at issue. Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis\n    in-evidence standard applies to this case, respondents cannot create a\n    genuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradictory) state\n    ments in the record. Pp. 29–33.\n         (iv) Fear of litigation alone cannot justify the City’s reliance on\n    race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and\n    qualified for promotions. Discarding the test results was impermis\n    sible under Title VII, and summary judgment is appropriate for peti\n    tioners on their disparate-treatment claim. If, after it certifies the\n    test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of\n    today’s holding the City can avoid disparate-impact liability based on\n    the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, it\n    would have been subject to disparate-treatment liability.

An agency’s officers command respect within the\ndepartment and in the whole community; and, of course,\nadded responsibilities command increased salary and\nbenefits. Aware of the intense competition for promotions,\nNew Haven, like many cities, relies on objective examina\ntions to identify the best qualified candidates.\n   In 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took examinations\nto qualify for promotion to the rank of lieutenant or cap\ntain. Promotion examinations in New Haven (or City)\nwere infrequent, so the stakes were high. The results\nwould determine which firefighters would be considered\nfor promotions during the next two years, and the order in\nwhich they would be considered. Many firefighters stud\n\f2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nied for months, at considerable personal and financial cost.\n  When the examination results showed that white candi\ndates had outperformed minority candidates, the mayor\nand other local politicians opened a public debate that\nturned rancorous. Some firefighters argued the tests\nshould be discarded because the results showed the tests\nto be discriminatory. They threatened a discrimination\nlawsuit if the City made promotions based on the tests.\nOther firefighters said the exams were neutral and fair.\nAnd they, in turn, threatened a discrimination lawsuit if\nthe City, relying on the statistical racial disparity, ignored\nthe test results and denied promotions to the candidates\nwho had performed well. In the end the City took the side\nof those who protested the test results. It threw out the\nexaminations.\n  Certain white and Hispanic firefighters who likely\nwould have been promoted based on their good test per\nformance sued the City and some of its officials. Theirs is\nthe suit now before us. The suit alleges that, by discard\ning the test results, the City and the named officials dis\ncriminated against the plaintiffs based on their race, in\nviolation of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., and\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend\nment. The City and the officials defended their actions,\narguing that if they had certified the results, they could\nhave faced liability under Title VII for adopting a practice\nthat had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendants, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n  We conclude that race-based action like the City’s in this\ncase is impermissible under Title VII unless the employer\ncan demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that, had it not\ntaken the action, it would have been liable under the\ndisparate-impact statute. The respondents, we further\ndetermine, cannot meet that threshold standard. As a\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult, the City’s action in discarding the tests was a\nviolation of Title VII. In light of our ruling under the\nstatutes, we need not reach the question whether respon\ndents’ actions may have violated the Equal Protection\nClause.\n                             I\n   This litigation comes to us after the parties’ cross\nmotions for summary judgment, so we set out the facts in\nsome detail. As the District Court noted, although “the\nparties strenuously dispute the relevance and legal import\nof, and inferences to be drawn from, many aspects of this\ncase, the underlying facts are largely undisputed.” 554\nF. Supp. 2d 142, 145 (Conn. 2006).\n                             A\n   When the City of New Haven undertook to fill vacant\nlieutenant and captain positions in its fire department\n(Department), the promotion and hiring process was gov\nerned by the city charter, in addition to federal and state\nlaw. The charter establishes a merit system. That system\nrequires the City to fill vacancies in the classified civil\nservice ranks with the most qualified individuals, as de\ntermined by job-related examinations. After each exami\nnation, the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) certifies\na ranked list of applicants who passed the test. Under the\ncharter’s “rule of three,” the relevant hiring authority\nmust fill each vacancy by choosing one candidate from the\ntop three scorers on the list. Certified promotional lists\nremain valid for two years.\n   The City’s contract with the New Haven firefighters’\nunion specifies additional requirements for the promotion\nprocess. Under the contract, applicants for lieutenant and\ncaptain positions were to be screened using written and\noral examinations, with the written exam accounting for\n60 percent and the oral exam 40 percent of an applicant’s\n\f4                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntotal score. To sit for the examinations, candidates for\nlieutenant needed 30 months’ experience in the Depart\nment, a high-school diploma, and certain vocational train\ning courses. Candidates for captain needed one year’s\nservice as a lieutenant in the Department, a high-school\ndiploma, and certain vocational training courses.\n   After reviewing bids from various consultants, the City\nhired Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc. (IOS) to\ndevelop and administer the examinations, at a cost to the\nCity of $100,000. IOS is an Illinois company that special\nizes in designing entry-level and promotional examina\ntions for fire and police departments. In order to fit the\nexaminations to the New Haven Department, IOS began\nthe test-design process by performing job analyses to\nidentify the tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are\nessential for the lieutenant and captain positions. IOS\nrepresentatives interviewed incumbent captains and\nlieutenants and their supervisors. They rode with and\nobserved other on-duty officers. Using information from\nthose interviews and ride-alongs, IOS wrote job-analysis\nquestionnaires and administered them to most of the\nincumbent battalion chiefs, captains, and lieutenants in\nthe Department. At every stage of the job analyses, IOS,\nby deliberate choice, oversampled minority firefighters to\nensure that the results—which IOS would use to develop\nthe examinations—would not unintentionally favor white\ncandidates.\n   With the job-analysis information in hand, IOS devel\noped the written examinations to measure the candidates’\njob-related knowledge. For each test, IOS compiled a list\nof training manuals, Department procedures, and other\nmaterials to use as sources for the test questions. IOS\npresented the proposed sources to the New Haven fire\nchief and assistant fire chief for their approval. Then,\nusing the approved sources, IOS drafted a multiple-choice\ntest for each position. Each test had 100 questions, as\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired by CSB rules, and was written below a 10th\ngrade reading level. After IOS prepared the tests, the City\nopened a 3-month study period. It gave candidates a list\nthat identified the source material for the questions, in\ncluding the specific chapters from which the questions\nwere taken.\n   IOS developed the oral examinations as well. These\nconcentrated on job skills and abilities. Using the job\nanalysis information, IOS wrote hypothetical situations to\ntest incident-command skills, firefighting tactics, interper\nsonal skills, leadership, and management ability, among\nother things. Candidates would be presented with these\nhypotheticals and asked to respond before a panel of three\nassessors.\n   IOS assembled a pool of 30 assessors who were superior\nin rank to the positions being tested. At the City’s insis\ntence (because of controversy surrounding previous ex\naminations), all the assessors came from outside Connecti\ncut. IOS submitted the assessors’ resumes to City officials\nfor approval. They were battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs,\nand chiefs from departments of similar sizes to New Ha\nven’s throughout the country. Sixty-six percent of the\npanelists were minorities, and each of the nine three\nmember assessment panels contained two minority mem\nbers. IOS trained the panelists for several hours on the\nday before it administered the examinations, teaching\nthem how to score the candidates’ responses consistently\nusing checklists of desired criteria.\n   Candidates took the examinations in November and\nDecember 2003. Seventy-seven candidates completed the\nlieutenant examination—43 whites, 19 blacks, and 15\nHispanics. Of those, 34 candidates passed—25 whites, 6\nblacks, and 3 Hispanics. 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 145. Eight\nlieutenant positions were vacant at the time of the exami\nnation. As the rule of three operated, this meant that the\ntop 10 candidates were eligible for an immediate promo\n\f6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion to lieutenant. All 10 were white. Ibid. Subsequent\nvacancies would have allowed at least 3 black candidates\nto be considered for promotion to lieutenant.\n   Forty-one candidates completed the captain examina\ntion—25 whites, 8 blacks, and 8 Hispanics. Of those, 22\ncandidates passed—16 whites, 3 blacks, and 3 Hispanics.\nIbid. Seven captain positions were vacant at the time of\nthe examination. Under the rule of three, 9 candidates\nwere eligible for an immediate promotion to captain—7\nwhites and 2 Hispanics. Ibid.\n                             B\n   The City’s contract with IOS contemplated that, after\nthe examinations, IOS would prepare a technical report\nthat described the examination processes and methodolo\ngies and analyzed the results. But in January 2004,\nrather than requesting the technical report, City officials,\nincluding the City’s counsel, Thomas Ude, convened a\nmeeting with IOS Vice President Chad Legel. (Legel was\nthe leader of the IOS team that developed and adminis\ntered the tests.) Based on the test results, the City offi\ncials expressed concern that the tests had discriminated\nagainst minority candidates. Legel defended the examina\ntions’ validity, stating that any numerical disparity be\ntween white and minority candidates was likely due to\nvarious external factors and was in line with results of the\nDepartment’s previous promotional examinations.\n   Several days after the meeting, Ude sent a letter to the\nCSB purporting to outline its duties with respect to the\nexamination results. Ude stated that under federal law,\n“a statistical demonstration of disparate impact,” standing\nalone, “constitutes a sufficiently serious claim of racial\ndiscrimination to serve as a predicate for employer\ninitiated, voluntar[y] remedies—even . . . race-conscious\nremedies.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 443a;\nsee also 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 145 (issue of disparate impact\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“appears to have been raised by . . . Ude”).\n                               1\n   The CSB first met to consider certifying the results on\nJanuary 22, 2004. Tina Burgett, director of the City’s\nDepartment of Human Resources, opened the meeting by\ntelling the CSB that “there is a significant disparate im\npact on these two exams.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–\n1428, at 466a. She distributed lists showing the candi\ndates’ races and scores (written, oral, and composite) but\nnot their names. Ude also described the test results as\nreflecting “a very significant disparate impact,” id., at\n477a, and he outlined possible grounds for the CSB’s\nrefusing to certify the results.\n   Although they did not know whether they had passed or\nfailed, some firefighter-candidates spoke at the first CSB\nmeeting in favor of certifying the test results. Michael\nBlatchley stated that “[e]very one” of the questions on the\nwritten examination “came from the [study] material. . . .\n[I]f you read the materials and you studied the material,\nyou would have done well on the test.” App. in No. 06–\n4996–cv (CA2), pp. A772–A773 (hereinafter CA2 App.).\nFrank Ricci stated that the test questions were based on\nthe Department’s own rules and procedures and on “na\ntionally recognized” materials that represented the “ac\ncepted standard[s]” for firefighting. Id., at A785–A786.\nRicci stated that he had “several learning disabilities,”\nincluding dyslexia; that he had spent more than $1,000 to\npurchase the materials and pay his neighbor to read them\non tape so he could “give it [his] best shot”; and that he\nhad studied “8 to 13 hours a day to prepare” for the test.\nId., at A786, A789. “I don’t even know if I made it,” Ricci\ntold the CSB, “[b]ut the people who passed should be\npromoted. When your life’s on the line, second best may\nnot be good enough.” Id., at A787–A788.\n   Other firefighters spoke against certifying the test\n\f8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresults. They described the test questions as outdated or\nnot relevant to firefighting practices in New Haven. Gary\nTinney stated that source materials “came out of New\nYork. . . . Their makeup of their city and everything is\ntotally different than ours.” Id., at A774–A775; see also\nid., at A779, A780–A781. And they criticized the test\nmaterials, a full set of which cost about $500, for being too\nexpensive and too long.\n                              2\n   At a second CSB meeting, on February 5, the president\nof the New Haven firefighters’ union asked the CSB to\nperform a validation study to determine whether the tests\nwere job-related. Petitioners’ counsel in this action argued\nthat the CSB should certify the results. A representative\nof the International Association of Black Professional\nFirefighters, Donald Day from neighboring Bridgeport,\nConnecticut, “beseech[ed]” the CSB “to throw away that\ntest,” which he described as “inherently unfair” because of\nthe racial distribution of the results. Id., at A830–A831.\nAnother Bridgeport-based representative of the associa\ntion, Ronald Mackey, stated that a validation study was\nnecessary. He suggested that the City could “adjust” the\ntest results to “meet the criteria of having a certain\namount of minorities get elevated to the rank of Lieuten\nant and Captain.” Id., at A838. At the end of this meet\ning, the CSB members agreed to ask IOS to send a repre\nsentative to explain how it had developed and\nadministered the examinations.        They also discussed\nasking a panel of experts to review the examinations and\nadvise the CSB whether to certify the results.\n                             3\n  At a third meeting, on February 11, Legel addressed the\nCSB on behalf of IOS. Legel stated that IOS had previ\nously prepared entry-level firefighter examinations for the\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCity but not a promotional examination. He explained\nthat IOS had developed examinations for departments in\ncommunities with demographics similar to New Haven’s,\nincluding Orange County, Florida; Lansing, Michigan; and\nSan Jose, California.\n   Legel explained the exam-development process to the\nCSB. He began by describing the job analyses IOS per\nformed of the captain and lieutenant positions—the inter\nviews, ride-alongs, and questionnaires IOS designed to\n“generate a list of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities\nthat are considered essential to performance” of the jobs.\nId., at A931–A932. He outlined how IOS prepared the\nwritten and oral examinations, based on the job-analysis\nresults, to test most heavily those qualities that the re\nsults indicated were “critica[l]” or “essentia[l].” Id., at\nA931. And he noted that IOS took the material for each\ntest question directly from the approved source materials.\nLegel told the CSB that third-party reviewers had scruti\nnized the examinations to ensure that the written test was\ndrawn from the source material and that the oral test\naccurately tested real-world situations that captains and\nlieutenants would face. Legel confirmed that IOS had\nselected oral-examination panelists so that each three\nmember assessment panel included one white, one black,\nand one Hispanic member.\n   Near the end of his remarks, Legel “implor[ed] anyone\nthat had . . . concerns to review the content of the exam.\nIn my professional opinion, it’s facially neutral. There’s\nnothing in those examinations . . . that should cause\nsomebody to think that one group would perform differ\nently than another group.” Id., at A961.\n                              4\n  At the next meeting, on March 11, the CSB heard from\nthree witnesses it had selected to “tell us a little bit about\ntheir views of the testing, the process, [and] the methodol\n\f10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nogy.” Id., at A1020. The first, Christopher Hornick, spoke\nto the CSB by telephone.           Hornick is an indus\ntrial/organizational psychologist from Texas who operates\na consulting business that “direct[ly]” competes with IOS.\nId., at A1029. Hornick, who had not “stud[ied] the test at\nlength or in detail” and had not “seen the job analysis\ndata,” told the CSB that the scores indicated a “relatively\nhigh adverse impact.” Id., at A1028, A1030, A1043. He\nstated that “[n]ormally, whites outperform ethnic minori\nties on the majority of standardized testing procedures,”\nbut that he was “a little surprised” by the disparity in the\ncandidates’ scores—although “[s]ome of it is fairly typical\nof what we’ve seen in other areas of the countr[y] and\nother tests.” Id., at A1028–A1029. Hornick stated that\nthe “adverse impact on the written exam was somewhat\nhigher but generally in the range that we’ve seen profes\nsionally.” Id., at A1030–A1031.\n   When asked to explain the New Haven test results,\nHornick opined in the telephone conversation that the\ncollective-bargaining agreement’s requirement of using\nwritten and oral examinations with a 60/40 composite\nscore might account for the statistical disparity. He also\nstated that “[b]y not having anyone from within the\n[D]epartment review” the tests before they were adminis\ntered—a limitation the City had imposed to protect the\nsecurity of the exam questions—“you inevitably get things\nin there” that are based on the source materials but are\nnot relevant to New Haven. Id., at A1034–A1035. Hor\nnick suggested that testing candidates at an “assessment\ncenter” rather than using written and oral examinations\n“might serve [the City’s] needs better.” Id., at A1039–\nA1040. Hornick stated that assessment centers, where\ncandidates face real-world situations and respond just as\nthey would in the field, allow candidates “to demonstrate\nhow they would address a particular problem as opposed\nto just verbally saying it or identifying the correct option\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non a written test.” Ibid.\n   Hornick made clear that he was “not suggesting that\n[IOS] somehow created a test that had adverse impacts\nthat it should not have had.” Id., at A1038. He described\nthe IOS examinations as “reasonably good test[s].” Id., at\nA1041. He stated that the CSB’s best option might be to\n“certify the list as it exists” and work to change the proc\ness for future tests, including by “[r]ewriting the Civil\nService Rules.” Ibid. Hornick concluded his telephonic\nremarks by telling the CSB that “for the future,” his com\npany “certainly would like to help you if we can.” Id., at\nA1046.\n   The second witness was Vincent Lewis, a fire program\nspecialist for the Department of Homeland Security and a\nretired fire captain from Michigan. Lewis, who is black,\nhad looked “extensively” at the lieutenant exam and “a\nlittle less extensively” at the captain exam. He stated that\nthe candidates “should know that material.” Id., at\nA1048, A1052. In Lewis’s view, the “questions were rele\nvant for both exams,” and the New Haven candidates had\nan advantage because the study materials identified the\nparticular book chapters from which the questions were\ntaken. In other departments, by contrast, “you had to\nknow basically the . . . entire book.” Id., at A1053. Lewis\nconcluded that any disparate impact likely was due to a\npattern that “usually whites outperform some of the mi\nnorities on testing,” or that “more whites . . . take the\nexam.” Id., at A1054.\n   The final witness was Janet Helms, a professor at Bos\nton College whose “primary area of expertise” is “not with\nfirefighters per se” but in “race and culture as they influ\nence performance on tests and other assessment proce\ndures.” Id., at A1060. Helms expressly declined the CSB’s\noffer to review the examinations. At the outset, she noted\nthat “regardless of what kind of written test we give in\nthis country . . . we can just about predict how many peo\n\f12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nple will pass who are members of under-represented\ngroups. And your data are not that inconsistent with\nwhat predictions would say were the case.” Id., at A1061.\nHelms nevertheless offered several “ideas about what\nmight be possible factors” to explain statistical differences\nin the results. Id., at A1062. She concluded that because\n67 percent of the respondents to the job-analysis question\nnaires were white, the test questions might have favored\nwhite candidates, because “most of the literature on fire\nfighters shows that the different groups perform the job\ndifferently.” Id., at A1063. Helms closed by stating that\nno matter what test the City had administered, it would\nhave revealed “a disparity between blacks and whites,\nHispanics and whites,” particularly on a written test. Id.,\nat A1072.\n                              5\n  At the final CSB meeting, on March 18, Ude (the City’s\ncounsel) argued against certifying the examination re\nsults. Discussing the City’s obligations under federal law,\nUde advised the CSB that a finding of adverse impact “is\nthe beginning, not the end, of a review of testing proce\ndures” to determine whether they violated the disparate\nimpact provision of Title VII. Ude focused the CSB on\ndetermining “whether there are other ways to test for . . .\nthose positions that are equally valid with less adverse\nimpact.” Id., at A1101. Ude described Hornick as having\nsaid that the written examination “had one of the most\nsevere adverse impacts that he had seen” and that “there\nare much better alternatives to identifying [firefighting]\nskills.” Ibid. Ude offered his “opinion that promotions . . .\nas a result of these tests would not be consistent with\nfederal law, would not be consistent with the purposes of\nour Civil Service Rules or our Charter[,] nor is it in the\nbest interests of the firefighters . . . who took the exams.”\nId., at A1103–A1104. He stated that previous Department\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexams “have not had this kind of result,” and that previ\nous results had not been “challenged as having adverse\nimpact, whereas we are assured that these will be.” Id., at\nA1107, A1108.\n  CSB Chairman Segaloff asked Ude several questions\nabout the Title VII disparate-impact standard.\n       “CHAIRPERSON SEGALOFF: [M]y understanding\n    is the group . . . that is making to throw the exam out\n    has the burden of showing that there is out there an\n    exam that is reasonably probable or likely to have less\n    of an adverse impact. It’s not our burden to show that\n    there’s an exam out there that can be better. We’ve\n    got an exam. We’ve got a result. . . .\n       “MR. UDE: Mr. Chair, I point out that Dr. Hornick\n    said that. He said that there are other tests out there\n    that would have less adverse impact and that [would]\n    be more valid.\n       “CHAIRPERSON SEGALOFF: You think that’s\n    enough for us to throw this test upside-down . . . be\n    cause Dr. Hornick said it?\n       “MR. UDE: I think that by itself would be sufficient.\n    Yes. I also would point out that . . . it is the em\n    ployer’s burden to justify the use of the examination.”\n    Id., at A1108–A1109.\n  Karen DuBois-Walton, the City’s chief administrative\nofficer, spoke on behalf of Mayor John DeStefano and\nargued against certifying the results. DuBois-Walton\nstated that the results, when considered under the rule of\nthree and applied to then-existing captain and lieutenant\nvacancies, created a situation in which black and Hispanic\ncandidates were disproportionately excluded from oppor\ntunity. DuBois-Walton also relied on Hornick’s testimony,\nasserting that Hornick “made it extremely clear that . . .\nthere are more appropriate ways to assess one’s ability to\nserve” as a captain or lieutenant. Id., at A1120.\n\f14                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Burgett (the human resources director) asked the CSB\nto discard the examination results. She, too, relied on\nHornick’s statement to show the existence of alternative\ntesting methods, describing Hornick as having “started to\npoint out that alternative testing does exist” and as having\n“begun to suggest that there are some different ways of\ndoing written examinations.” Id., at A1125, A1128.\n   Other witnesses addressed the CSB. They included the\npresident of the New Haven firefighters’ union, who sup\nported certification. He reminded the CSB that Hornick\n“also concluded that the tests were reasonable and fair\nand under the current structure to certify them.” Id., at\nA1137. Firefighter Frank Ricci again argued for certifica\ntion; he stated that although “assessment centers in some\ncases show less adverse impact,” id., at A1140, they were\nnot available alternatives for the current round of promo\ntions. It would take several years, Ricci explained, for the\nDepartment to develop an assessment-center protocol and\nthe accompanying training materials. Id., at A1141.\nLieutenant Matthew Marcarelli, who had taken the cap\ntain’s exam, spoke in favor of certification.\n   At the close of witness testimony, the CSB voted on a\nmotion to certify the examinations. With one member\nrecused, the CSB deadlocked 2 to 2, resulting in a decision\nnot to certify the results. Explaining his vote to certify the\nresults, Chairman Segaloff stated that “nobody convinced\nme that we can feel comfortable that, in fact, there’s some\nlikelihood that there’s going to be an exam designed that’s\ngoing to be less discriminatory.” Id., at A1159–A1160.\n                             C\n   The CSB’s decision not to certify the examination re\nsults led to this lawsuit. The plaintiffs—who are the\npetitioners here—are 17 white firefighters and 1 Hispanic\nfirefighter who passed the examinations but were denied a\nchance at promotions when the CSB refused to certify the\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntest results. They include the named plaintiff, Frank\nRicci, who addressed the CSB at multiple meetings.\n   Petitioners sued the City, Mayor DeStefano, DuBois-\nWalton, Ude, Burgett, and the two CSB members who\nvoted against certification. Petitioners also named as a\ndefendant Boise Kimber, a New Haven resident who\nvoiced strong opposition to certifying the results. Those\nindividuals are respondents in this Court. Petitioners\nfiled suit under Rev. Stat. §§1979 and 1980, 42 U. S. C.\n§§1983 and 1985, alleging that respondents, by arguing or\nvoting against certifying the results, violated and con\nspired to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment. Petitioners also filed timely charges\nof discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC); upon the EEOC’s issuing right\nto-sue letters, petitioners amended their complaint to\nassert that the City violated the disparate-treatment\nprohibition contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, as amended. See 42 U. S. C. §§2000e–2(a).\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\nRespondents asserted they had a good-faith belief that\nthey would have violated the disparate-impact prohibition\nin Title VII, §2000e–2(k), had they certified the examina\ntion results. It follows, they maintained, that they cannot\nbe held liable under Title VII’s disparate-treatment provi\nsion for attempting to comply with Title VII’s disparate\nimpact bar. Petitioners countered that respondents’ good\nfaith belief was not a valid defense to allegations of dispa\nrate treatment and unconstitutional discrimination.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nrespondents. 554 F. Supp. 2d 142. It described petition\ners’ argument as “boil[ing] down to the assertion that if\n[respondents] cannot prove that the disparities on the\nLieutenant and Captain exams were due to a particular\nflaw inherent in those exams, then they should have\ncertified the results because there was no other alterna\n\f16                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntive in place.” Id., at 156. The District Court concluded\nthat, “[n]otwithstanding the shortcomings in the evidence\non existing, effective alternatives, it is not the case that\n[respondents] must certify a test where they cannot pin\npoint its deficiency explaining its disparate impact . . .\nsimply because they have not yet formulated a better\nselection method.” Ibid. It also ruled that respondents’\n“motivation to avoid making promotions based on a test\nwith a racially disparate impact . . . does not, as a matter\nof law, constitute discriminatory intent” under Title VII.\nId., at 160. The District Court rejected petitioners’ equal\nprotection claim on the theory that respondents had not\nacted because of “discriminatory animus” toward petition\ners. Id., at 162. It concluded that respondents’ actions\nwere not “based on race” because “all applicants took the\nsame test, and the result was the same for all because the\ntest results were discarded and nobody was promoted.”\nId., at 161.\n   After full briefing and argument by the parties, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed in a one-paragraph, unpub\nlished summary order; it later withdrew that order, issu\ning in its place a nearly identical, one-paragraph per\ncuriam opinion adopting the District Court’s reasoning.\n530 F. 3d 87 (CA2 2008). Three days later, the Court of\nAppeals voted 7 to 6 to deny rehearing en banc, over writ\nten dissents by Chief Judge Jacobs and Judge Cabranes.\n530 F. 3d 88.\n   This action presents two provisions of Title VII to be\ninterpreted and reconciled, with few, if any, precedents in\nthe courts of appeals discussing the issue. Depending on\nthe resolution of the statutory claim, a fundamental con\nstitutional question could also arise. We found it prudent\nand appropriate to grant certiorari. 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\nWe now reverse.\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

A decision for petitioners on their\nstatutory claim would provide the relief sought, so we\nconsider it first. See Atkins v. Parker, 472 U. S. 115, 123\n(1985); Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51\n(1984) (per curiam) (“[N]ormally the Court will not decide\na constitutional question if there is some other ground\nupon which to dispose of the case”).\n                             A\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e et seq., as amended, prohibits employment dis\ncrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin. Title VII prohibits both intentional dis\ncrimination (known as “disparate treatment”) as well as,\nin some cases, practices that are not intended to discrimi\nnate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse effect on\nminorities (known as “disparate impact”).\n   As enacted in 1964, Title VII’s principal nondiscrimina\ntion provision held employers liable only for disparate\ntreatment. That section retains its original wording to\nday. It makes it unlawful for an employer “to fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ\nment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.” §2000e–2(a)(1); see also 78 Stat. 255.\nDisparate-treatment cases present “the most easily under\nstood type of discrimination,” Teamsters v. United States,\n431 U. S. 324, 335, n. 15 (1977), and occur where an em\nployer has “treated [a] particular person less favorably\nthan others because of” a protected trait. Watson v. Fort\nWorth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 985–986 (1988). A\n\f18                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisparate-treatment plaintiff must establish “that the\ndefendant had a discriminatory intent or motive” for\ntaking a job-related action. Id., at 986.\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not include an express\nprohibition on policies or practices that produce a dispa\nrate impact. But in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S.\n424 (1971), the Court interpreted the Act to prohibit, in\nsome cases, employers’ facially neutral practices that, in\nfact, are “discriminatory in operation.” Id., at 431. The\nGriggs Court stated that the “touchstone” for disparate\nimpact liability is the lack of “business necessity”: “If an\nemployment practice which operates to exclude [minori\nties] cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the\npractice is prohibited.” Ibid.; see also id., at 432 (em\nployer’s burden to demonstrate that practice has “a mani\nfest relationship to the employment in question”); Albe\nmarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 425 (1975).\nUnder those precedents, if an employer met its burden by\nshowing that its practice was job-related, the plaintiff was\nrequired to show a legitimate alternative that would have\nresulted in less discrimination. Ibid. (allowing complain\ning party to show “that other tests or selection devices,\nwithout a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also\nserve the employer’s legitimate interest”).\n   Twenty years after Griggs, the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n105 Stat. 1071, was enacted. The Act included a provision\ncodifying the prohibition on disparate-impact discrimina\ntion. That provision is now in force along with the dispa\nrate-treatment section already noted. Under the dispa\nrate-impact statute, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie\nviolation by showing that an employer uses “a particular\nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). An employer may defend\nagainst liability by demonstrating that the practice is “job\nrelated for the position in question and consistent with\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness necessity.” Ibid. Even if the employer meets\nthat burden, however, a plaintiff may still succeed by\nshowing that the employer refuses to adopt an available\nalternative employment practice that has less disparate\nimpact and serves the employer’s legitimate needs.\n§§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).\n                              B\n   Petitioners allege that when the CSB refused to certify\nthe captain and lieutenant exam results based on the race\nof the successful candidates, it discriminated against them\nin violation of Title VII’s disparate-treatment provision.\nThe City counters that its decision was permissible be\ncause the tests “appear[ed] to violate Title VII’s disparate\nimpact provisions.” Brief for Respondents 12.\n   Our analysis begins with this premise: The City’s ac\ntions would violate the disparate-treatment prohibition of\nTitle VII absent some valid defense. All the evidence\ndemonstrates that the City chose not to certify the exami\nnation results because of the statistical disparity based on\nrace—i.e., how minority candidates had performed when\ncompared to white candidates. As the District Court put\nit, the City rejected the test results because “too many\nwhites and not enough minorities would be promoted were\nthe lists to be certified.” 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 152; see also\nibid. (respondents’ “own arguments . . . show that the\nCity’s reasons for advocating non-certification were re\nlated to the racial distribution of the results”). Without\nsome other justification, this express, race-based deci\nsionmaking violates Title VII’s command that employers\ncannot take adverse employment actions because of an\nindividual’s race. See §2000e–2(a)(1).\n   The District Court did not adhere to this principle,\nhowever. It held that respondents’ “motivation to avoid\nmaking promotions based on a test with a racially dispa\nrate impact . . . does not, as a matter of law, constitute\n\f20                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscriminatory intent.” 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 160. And the\nGovernment makes a similar argument in this Court. It\ncontends that the “structure of Title VII belies any claim\nthat an employer’s intent to comply with Title VII’s dispa\nrate-impact provisions constitutes prohibited discrimina\ntion on the basis of race.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11. But both of those statements turn\nupon the City’s objective—avoiding disparate-impact\nliability—while ignoring the City’s conduct in the name of\nreaching that objective. Whatever the City’s ultimate\naim—however well intentioned or benevolent it might\nhave seemed—the City made its employment decision\nbecause of race. The City rejected the test results solely\nbecause the higher scoring candidates were white. The\nquestion is not whether that conduct was discriminatory\nbut whether the City had a lawful justification for its race\nbased action.\n   We consider, therefore, whether the purpose to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\nbe prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. Courts\noften confront cases in which statutes and principles point\nin different directions. Our task is to provide guidance to\nemployers and courts for situations when these two prohi\nbitions could be in conflict absent a rule to reconcile them.\nIn providing this guidance our decision must be consistent\nwith the important purpose of Title VII—that the work\nplace be an environment free of discrimination, where race\nis not a barrier to opportunity.\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the parties’\nproposed means of reconciling the statutory provisions.\nPetitioners take a strict approach, arguing that under\nTitle VII, it cannot be permissible for an employer to take\nrace-based adverse employment actions in order to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability—even if the employer knows its\npractice violates the disparate-impact provision. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 43. Petitioners would have us hold that,\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder Title VII, avoiding unintentional discrimination\ncannot justify intentional discrimination. That assertion,\nhowever, ignores the fact that, by codifying the disparate\nimpact provision in 1991, Congress has expressly prohib\nited both types of discrimination. We must interpret the\nstatute to give effect to both provisions where possible.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Atlantic Research Corp.,\n551 U. S. 128, 137 (2007) (rejecting an interpretation\nthat would render a statutory provision “a dead letter”).\nWe cannot accept petitioners’ broad and inflexible\nformulation.\n   Petitioners next suggest that an employer in fact must\nbe in violation of the disparate-impact provision before it\ncan use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment\nsuit. Again, this is overly simplistic and too restrictive of\nTitle VII’s purpose. The rule petitioners offer would run\ncounter to what we have recognized as Congress’s intent\nthat “voluntary compliance” be “the preferred means of\nachieving the objectives of Title VII.” Firefighters v. Cleve\nland, 478 U. S. 501, 515 (1986); see also Wygant v. Jack\nson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 290 (1986) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Forbid\nding employers to act unless they know, with certainty,\nthat a practice violates the disparate-impact provision\nwould bring compliance efforts to a near standstill. Even\nin the limited situations when this restricted standard\ncould be met, employers likely would hesitate before tak\ning voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in\nthe course of litigation and then held to account for dispa\nrate treatment.\n   At the opposite end of the spectrum, respondents and\nthe Government assert that an employer’s good-faith belief\nthat its actions are necessary to comply with Title VII’s\ndisparate-impact provision should be enough to justify\nrace-conscious conduct. But the original, foundational\nprohibition of Title VII bars employers from taking ad\n\f22                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nverse action “because of . . . race.” §2000e–2(a)(1). And\nwhen Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in\n1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability\nfor actions taken in a good-faith effort to comply with the\nnew, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k). Allow\ning employers to violate the disparate-treatment prohibi\ntion based on a mere good-faith fear of disparate-impact\nliability would encourage race-based action at the slightest\nhint of disparate impact. A minimal standard could cause\nemployers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial\npromotional examinations even where there is little if any\nevidence of disparate-impact discrimination. That would\namount to a de facto quota system, in which a “focus on\nstatistics . . . could put undue pressure on employers to\nadopt inappropriate prophylactic measures.” Watson, 487\nU. S., at 992 (plurality opinion). Even worse, an employer\ncould discard test results (or other employment practices)\nwith the intent of obtaining the employer’s preferred racial\nbalance. That operational principle could not be justified,\nfor Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of\nits requirements as calling for outright racial balancing.\n§2000e–2(j). The purpose of Title VII “is to promote hiring\non the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis\nof race or color.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at 434.\n    In searching for a standard that strikes a more appro\npriate balance, we note that this Court has considered\ncases similar to this one, albeit in the context of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The\nCourt has held that certain government actions to remedy\npast racial discrimination—actions that are themselves\nbased on race—are constitutional only where there is a\n“ ‘strong basis in evidence’ ” that the remedial actions were\nnecessary. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469,\n500 (1989) (quoting Wygant, supra, at 277 (plurality opin\nion)). This suit does not call on us to consider whether the\nstatutory constraints under Title VII must be parallel in\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall respects to those under the Constitution. That does not\nmean the constitutional authorities are irrelevant, how\never. Our cases discussing constitutional principles can\nprovide helpful guidance in this statutory context. See\nWatson, supra, at 993 (plurality opinion).\n   Writing for a plurality in Wygant and announcing the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard, Justice Powell recog\nnized the tension between eliminating segregation and\ndiscrimination on the one hand and doing away with all\ngovernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on\nthe other. 476 U. S., at 277. The plurality stated that\nthose “related constitutional duties are not always harmo\nnious,” and that “reconciling them requires . . . employers\nto act with extraordinary care.” Ibid. The plurality re\nquired a strong basis in evidence because “[e]videntiary\nsupport for the conclusion that remedial action is war\nranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is\nchallenged in court by nonminority employees.” Ibid. The\nCourt applied the same standard in Croson, observing that\n“an amorphous claim that there has been past discrimina\ntion . . . cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial\nquota.” 488 U. S., at 499.\n   The same interests are at work in the interplay between\nthe disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions\nof Title VII. Congress has imposed liability on employers\nfor unintentional discrimination in order to rid the work\nplace of “practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory\nin operation.” Griggs, supra, at 431. But it has also pro\nhibited employers from taking adverse employment ac\ntions “because of” race. §2000e–2(a)(1). Applying the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect\nto both the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact\nprovisions, allowing violations of one in the name of com\npliance with the other only in certain, narrow circum\nstances. The standard leaves ample room for employers’\nvoluntary compliance efforts, which are essential to the\n\f24                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatutory scheme and to Congress’s efforts to eradicate\nworkplace discrimination. See Firefighters, supra, at 515.\nAnd the standard appropriately constrains employers’\ndiscretion in making race-based decisions: It limits that\ndiscretion to cases in which there is a strong basis in\nevidence of disparate-impact liability, but it is not so\nrestrictive that it allows employers to act only when there\nis a provable, actual violation.\n   Resolving the statutory conflict in this way allows the\ndisparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is\nconsistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the\nprohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores\non the basis of race. See §2000e–2(l). Examinations like\nthose administered by the City create legitimate expecta\ntions on the part of those who took the tests. As is the\ncase with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters\nhere invested substantial time, money, and personal\ncommitment in preparing for the tests. Employment tests\ncan be an important part of a neutral selection system\nthat safeguards against the very racial animosities Title\nVII was intended to prevent. Here, however, the firefight\ners saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reli\nance upon race-based statistics.\n   If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candi\ndates’ race, §2000e–2(l), then it follows a fortiori that it\nmay not take the greater step of discarding the test alto\ngether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of\npromotion-eligible candidates—absent a strong basis in\nevidence that the test was deficient and that discarding\nthe results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate\nimpact provision. Restricting an employer’s ability to\ndiscard test results (and thereby discriminate against\nqualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in\nkeeping with Title VII’s express protection of bona fide\npromotional examinations. See §2000e–2(h) (“[N]or shall\nit be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive and to act upon the results of any professionally\ndeveloped ability test provided that such test, its admini\nstration or action upon the results is not designed, in\ntended or used to discriminate because of race”); cf. AT&T\nCorp. v. Hulteen, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8).\n  For the foregoing reasons, we adopt the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard as a matter of statutory construction to\nresolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact provisions of Title VII.\n  Our statutory holding does not address the constitution\nality of the measures taken here in purported compliance\nwith Title VII. We also do not hold that meeting the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard would satisfy the Equal\nProtection Clause in a future case. As we explain below,\nbecause respondents have not met their burden under\nTitle VII, we need not decide whether a legitimate fear of\ndisparate impact is ever sufficient to justify discriminatory\ntreatment under the Constitution.\n  Nor do we question an employer’s affirmative efforts to\nensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for\npromotions and to participate in the process by which\npromotions will be made. But once that process has been\nestablished and employers have made clear their selection\ncriteria, they may not then invalidate the test results,\nthus upsetting an employee’s legitimate expectation not to\nbe judged on the basis of race. Doing so, absent a strong\nbasis in evidence of an impermissible disparate impact,\namounts to the sort of racial preference that Congress has\ndisclaimed, §2000e–2(j), and is antithetical to the notion of\na workplace where individuals are guaranteed equal\nopportunity regardless of race.\n  Title VII does not prohibit an employer from consider\ning, before administering a test or practice, how to design\nthat test or practice in order to provide a fair opportunity\nfor all individuals, regardless of their race. And when,\nduring the test-design stage, an employer invites com\n\f26                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nments to ensure the test is fair, that process can provide a\ncommon ground for open discussions toward that end. We\nhold only that, under Title VII, before an employer can\nengage in intentional discrimination for the asserted\npurpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional dispa\nrate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in\nevidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact\nliability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discrimina\ntory action.\n                              C\n   The City argues that, even under the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard, its decision to discard the examination\nresults was permissible under Title VII. That is incorrect.\nEven if respondents were motivated as a subjective matter\nby a desire to avoid committing disparate-impact dis\ncrimination, the record makes clear there is no support for\nthe conclusion that respondents had an objective, strong\nbasis in evidence to find the tests inadequate, with some\nconsequent disparate-impact liability in violation of Title\nVII.\n   On this basis, we conclude that petitioners have met\ntheir obligation to demonstrate that there is “no genuine\nissue as to any material fact” and that they are “entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c).\nOn a motion for summary judgment, “facts must be viewed\nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if\nthere is a ‘genuine’ dispute as to those facts.” Scott v.\nHarris, 550 U. S. 372, 380 (2007). “Where the record\ntaken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to\nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for\ntrial.” Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio\nCorp., 475 U. S. 574, 587 (1986) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In this Court, the City’s only defense is that it\nacted to comply with Title VII’s disparate-impact provi\nsion. To succeed on their motion, then, petitioners must\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndemonstrate that there can be no genuine dispute that\nthere was no strong basis in evidence for the City to con\nclude it would face disparate-impact liability if it certified\nthe examination results. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU. S. 317, 324 (1986) (where the nonmoving party “will\nbear the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue,” the\nnonmoving party bears the burden of production under\nRule 56 to “designate specific facts showing that there is\na genuine issue for trial” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n  The racial adverse impact here was significant, and\npetitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a\nprima facie case of disparate-impact liability. On the\ncaptain exam, the pass rate for white candidates was 64\npercent but was 37.5 percent for both black and Hispanic\ncandidates. On the lieutenant exam, the pass rate for\nwhite candidates was 58.1 percent; for black candidates,\n31.6 percent; and for Hispanic candidates, 20 percent. The\npass rates of minorities, which were approximately one\nhalf the pass rates for white candidates, fall well below the\n80-percent standard set by the EEOC to implement the\ndisparate-impact provision of Title VII. See 29 CFR\n§1607.4(D) (2008) (selection rate that is less than 80 per\ncent “of the rate for the group with the highest rate will\ngenerally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agen\ncies as evidence of adverse impact”); Watson, 487 U. S., at\n995–996, n. 3 (plurality opinion) (EEOC’s 80-percent\nstandard is “a rule of thumb for the courts”). Based on\nhow the passing candidates ranked and an application of\nthe “rule of three,” certifying the examinations would have\nmeant that the City could not have considered black can\ndidates for any of the then-vacant lieutenant or captain\npositions.\n  Based on the degree of adverse impact reflected in the\nresults, respondents were compelled to take a hard look at\nthe examinations to determine whether certifying the\n\f28                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresults would have had an impermissible disparate im\npact. The problem for respondents is that a prima facie\ncase of disparate-impact liability—essentially, a threshold\nshowing of a significant statistical disparity, Connecticut\nv. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 446 (1982), and nothing more—is\nfar from a strong basis in evidence that the City would\nhave been liable under Title VII had it certified the re\nsults. That is because the City could be liable for dispa\nrate-impact discrimination only if the examinations were\nnot job related and consistent with business necessity, or if\nthere existed an equally valid, less-discriminatory alterna\ntive that served the City’s needs but that the City refused\nto adopt. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A), (C). We conclude there is no\nstrong basis in evidence to establish that the test was\ndeficient in either of these respects. We address each of\nthe two points in turn, based on the record developed by\nthe parties through discovery—a record that concentrates\nin substantial part on the statements various witnesses\nmade to the CSB.\n                              1\n  There is no genuine dispute that the examinations were\njob-related and consistent with business necessity. The\nCity’s assertions to the contrary are “blatantly contra\ndicted by the record.” Scott, supra, at 380. The CSB\nheard statements from Chad Legel (the IOS vice presi\ndent) as well as city officials outlining the detailed steps\nIOS took to develop and administer the examinations.\nIOS devised the written examinations, which were the\nfocus of the CSB’s inquiry, after painstaking analyses of\nthe captain and lieutenant positions—analyses in which\nIOS made sure that minorities were overrepresented. And\nIOS drew the questions from source material approved by\nthe Department. Of the outside witnesses who appeared\nbefore the CSB, only one, Vincent Lewis, had reviewed the\nexaminations in any detail, and he was the only one with\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nany firefighting experience. Lewis stated that the “ques\ntions were relevant for both exams.” CA2 App. A1053.\nThe only other witness who had seen any part of the ex\naminations, Christopher Hornick (a competitor of IOS’s),\ncriticized the fact that no one within the Department had\nreviewed the tests—a condition imposed by the City to\nprotect the integrity of the exams in light of past alleged\nsecurity breaches. But Hornick stated that the exams\n“appea[r] to be . . . reasonably good” and recommended that\nthe CSB certify the results. Id., at A1041.\n   Arguing that the examinations were not job-related,\nrespondents note some candidates’ complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not spe\ncifically apply to firefighting practices in New Haven. But\nLegel told the CSB that IOS had addressed those con\ncerns—that it entertained “a handful” of challenges to the\nvalidity of particular examination questions, that it “re\nviewed those challenges and provided feedback [to the\nCity] as to what we thought the best course of action was,”\nand that he could remember at least one question IOS had\nthrown out (“offer[ing] credit to everybody for that particu\nlar question”). Id., at A955–A957. For his part, Hornick\nsaid he “suspect[ed] that some of the criticisms . . . [lev\neled] by candidates” were not valid. Id., at A1035.\n   The City, moreover, turned a blind eye to evidence that\nsupported the exams’ validity. Although the City’s con\ntract with IOS contemplated that IOS would prepare a\ntechnical report consistent with EEOC guidelines for\nexamination-validity studies, the City made no request for\nits report. After the January 2004 meeting between Legel\nand some of the city-official respondents, in which Legel\ndefended the examinations, the City sought no further\ninformation from IOS, save its appearance at a CSB meet\ning to explain how it developed and administered the\nexaminations. IOS stood ready to provide respondents\nwith detailed information to establish the validity of the\n\f30                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexams, but respondents did not accept that offer.\n                              2\n   Respondents also lacked a strong basis in evidence of an\nequally valid, less-discriminatory testing alternative that\nthe City, by certifying the examination results, would\nnecessarily have refused to adopt. Respondents raise\nthree arguments to the contrary, but each argument fails.\nFirst, respondents refer to testimony before the CSB that\na different composite-score calculation—weighting the\nwritten and oral examination scores 30/70—would have\nallowed the City to consider two black candidates for then\nopen lieutenant positions and one black candidate for\nthen-open captain positions. (The City used a 60/40\nweighting as required by its contract with the New Haven\nfirefighters’ union.) But respondents have produced no\nevidence to show that the 60/40 weighting was indeed\narbitrary. In fact, because that formula was the result of a\nunion-negotiated collective-bargaining agreement, we\npresume the parties negotiated that weighting for a ra\ntional reason. Nor does the record contain any evidence\nthat the 30/70 weighting would be an equally valid way to\ndetermine whether candidates possess the proper mix of\njob knowledge and situational skills to earn promotions.\nChanging the weighting formula, moreover, could well\nhave violated Title VII’s prohibition of altering test scores\non the basis of race. See §2000e–2(l). On this record,\nthere is no basis to conclude that a 30/70 weighting was an\nequally valid alternative the City could have adopted.\n   Second, respondents argue that the City could have\nadopted a different interpretation of the “rule of three”\nthat would have produced less discriminatory results. The\nrule, in the New Haven city charter, requires the City to\npromote only from “those applicants with the three high\nest scores” on a promotional examination. New Haven,\nConn., Code of Ordinances, Tit. I, Art. XXX, §160 (1992).\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nA state court has interpreted the charter to prohibit so\ncalled “banding”—the City’s previous practice of rounding\nscores to the nearest whole number and considering all\ncandidates with the same whole-number score as being of\none rank. Banding allowed the City to consider three\nranks of candidates (with the possibility of multiple candi\ndates filling each rank) for purposes of the rule of three.\nSee Kelly v. New Haven, No. CV000444614, 2004 WL\n114377, *3 (Conn. Super. Ct., Jan. 9, 2004). Respondents\nclaim that employing banding here would have made four\nblack and one Hispanic candidates eligible for then-open\nlieutenant and captain positions.\n   A state court’s prohibition of banding, as a matter of\nmunicipal law under the charter, may not eliminate band\ning as a valid alternative under Title VII. See 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–7. We need not resolve that point, however. Here,\nbanding was not a valid alternative for this reason: Had\nthe City reviewed the exam results and then adopted\nbanding to make the minority test scores appear higher, it\nwould have violated Title VII’s prohibition of adjusting\ntest results on the basis of race. §2000e–2(l); see also\nChicago Firefighters Local 2 v. Chicago, 249 F. 3d 649, 656\n(CA7 2001) (Posner, J.) (“We have no doubt that if banding\nwere adopted in order to make lower black scores seem\nhigher, it would indeed be . . . forbidden”). As a matter of\nlaw, banding was not an alternative available to the City\nwhen it was considering whether to certify the examina\ntion results.\n   Third, and finally, respondents refer to statements by\nHornick in his telephone interview with the CSB regard\ning alternatives to the written examinations. Hornick\nstated his “belie[f]” that an “assessment center process,”\nwhich would have evaluated candidates’ behavior in typi\ncal job tasks, “would have demonstrated less adverse\nimpact.” CA2 App. A1039. But Hornick’s brief mention of\nalternative testing methods, standing alone, does not raise\n\f32                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na genuine issue of material fact that assessment centers\nwere available to the City at the time of the examinations\nand that they would have produced less adverse impact.\nOther statements to the CSB indicated that the Depart\nment could not have used assessment centers for the 2003\nexaminations. Supra, at 14. And although respondents\nlater argued to the CSB that Hornick had pushed the City\nto reject the test results, supra, at 15–17, the truth is that\nthe essence of Hornick’s remarks supported its certifying\nthe test results. See Scott, 550 U. S., at 380. Hornick\nstated that adverse impact in standardized testing “has\nbeen in existence since the beginning of testing,” CA2 App.\nA1037, and that the disparity in New Haven’s test results\nwas “somewhat higher but generally in the range that\nwe’ve seen professionally.” Id., at A1030–A1031. He told\nthe CSB he was “not suggesting” that IOS “somehow\ncreated a test that had adverse impacts that it should not\nhave had.” Id., at A1038. And he suggested that the CSB\nshould “certify the list as it exists.” Id., at A1041.\n  Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard applies, respondents cannot create a\ngenuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradic\ntory) statements in the record. And there is no doubt\nrespondents fall short of the mark by relying entirely on\nisolated statements by Hornick.              Hornick had not\n“stud[ied] the test at length or in detail.” Id., at A1030.\nAnd as he told the CSB, he is a “direct competitor” of\nIOS’s. Id., at A1029. The remainder of his remarks\nshowed that Hornick’s primary concern—somewhat to the\nfrustration of CSB members—was marketing his services\nfor the future, not commenting on the results of the tests\nthe City had already administered. See, e.g., id., at\nA1026, A1027, A1032, A1036, A1040, A1041. Hornick’s\nhinting had its intended effect: The City has since hired\nhim as a consultant. As for the other outside witnesses\nwho spoke to the CSB, Vincent Lewis (the retired fire\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncaptain) thought the CSB should certify the test results.\nAnd Janet Helms (the Boston College professor) declined\nto review the examinations and told the CSB that, as a\nsociety, “we need to develop a new way of assessing peo\nple.” Id., at A1073. That task was beyond the reach of the\nCSB, which was concerned with the adequacy of the test\nresults before it.\n                             3\n  On the record before us, there is no genuine dispute that\nthe City lacked a strong basis in evidence to believe it\nwould face disparate-impact liability if it certified the\nexamination results. In other words, there is no evidence\n—let alone the required strong basis in evidence—that the\ntests were flawed because they were not job-related or\nbecause other, equally valid and less discriminatory tests\nwere available to the City. Fear of litigation alone cannot\njustify an employer’s reliance on race to the detriment of\nindividuals who passed the examinations and qualified for\npromotions. The City’s discarding the test results was\nimpermissible under Title VII, and summary judgment is\nappropriate for petitioners on their disparate-treatment\nclaim.\n                          *    *     *\n   The record in this litigation documents a process that, at\nthe outset, had the potential to produce a testing proce\ndure that was true to the promise of Title VII: No individ\nual should face workplace discrimination based on race.\nRespondents thought about promotion qualifications and\nrelevant experience in neutral ways. They were careful to\nensure broad racial participation in the design of the test\nitself and its administration. As we have discussed at\nlength, the process was open and fair.\n   The problem, of course, is that after the tests were\ncompleted, the raw racial results became the predominant\n\f34                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrationale for the City’s refusal to certify the results. The\ninjury arises in part from the high, and justified, expecta\ntions of the candidates who had participated in the testing\nprocess on the terms the City had established for the\npromotional process. Many of the candidates had studied\nfor months, at considerable personal and financial ex\npense, and thus the injury caused by the City’s reliance on\nraw racial statistics at the end of the process was all the\nmore severe. Confronted with arguments both for and\nagainst certifying the test results—and threats of a law\nsuit either way—the City was required to make a difficult\ninquiry. But its hearings produced no strong evidence of a\ndisparate-impact violation, and the City was not entitled\nto disregard the tests based solely on the racial disparity\nin the results.\n   Our holding today clarifies how Title VII applies to\nresolve competing expectations under the disparate\ntreatment and disparate-impact provisions. If, after it\ncertifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact\nsuit, then in light of our holding today it should be clear\nthat the City would avoid disparate-impact liability based\non the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified\nthe results, it would have been subject to disparate\ntreatment liability.\n   Petitioners are entitled to summary judgment on their\nTitle VII claim, and we therefore need not decide the\nunderlying constitutional question. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

The question is not an easy one. See\ngenerally Primus, Equal Protection and Disparate Impact:\nRound Three, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 493 (2003).\n   The difficulty is this: Whether or not Title VII’s dispa\nrate-treatment provisions forbid “remedial” race-based\nactions when a disparate-impact violation would not oth\nerwise result—the question resolved by the Court today—\nit is clear that Title VII not only permits but affirmatively\nrequires such actions when a disparate-impact violation\nwould otherwise result. See ante, at 20–21. But if the\nFederal Government is prohibited from discriminating on\nthe basis of race, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 500\n(1954), then surely it is also prohibited from enacting laws\n\f2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nmandating that third parties—e.g., employers, whether\nprivate, State, or municipal—discriminate on the basis of\nrace. See Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 78–82 (1917).\nAs the facts of these cases illustrate, Title VII’s disparate\nimpact provisions place a racial thumb on the scales, often\nrequiring employers to evaluate the racial outcomes of\ntheir policies, and to make decisions based on (because of)\nthose racial outcomes. That type of racial decisionmaking\nis, as the Court explains, discriminatory. See ante, at 19;\nPersonnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256,\n279 (1979).\n   To be sure, the disparate-impact laws do not mandate\nimposition of quotas, but it is not clear why that should\nprovide a safe harbor. Would a private employer not be\nguilty of unlawful discrimination if he refrained from\nestablishing a racial hiring quota but intentionally de\nsigned his hiring practices to achieve the same end?\nSurely he would. Intentional discrimination is still occur\nring, just one step up the chain. Government compulsion\nof such design would therefore seemingly violate equal\nprotection principles. Nor would it matter that Title VII\nrequires consideration of race on a wholesale, rather than\nretail, level. “[T]he Government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, not as simply components of a racial, reli\ngious, sexual or national class.” Miller v. Johnson, 515\nU. S. 900, 911 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd of course the purportedly benign motive for the dispa\nrate-impact provisions cannot save the statute. See Ada­\nrand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995).\n   It might be possible to defend the law by framing it as\nsimply an evidentiary tool used to identify genuine, inten\ntional discrimination—to “smoke out,” as it were, dispa\nrate treatment. See Primus, supra, at 498–499, 520–521.\nDisparate impact is sometimes (though not always, see\nWatson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 992\n(1988) (plurality opinion)) a signal of something illicit, so a\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nregulator might allow statistical disparities to play some\nrole in the evidentiary process. Cf. McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802–803 (1973). But argua\nbly the disparate-impact provisions sweep too broadly to\nbe fairly characterized in such a fashion—since they fail to\nprovide an affirmative defense for good-faith (i.e., nonra\ncially motivated) conduct, or perhaps even for good faith\nplus hiring standards that are entirely reasonable. See\npost, at 15–16, and n. 1 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (de\nscribing the demanding nature of the “business necessity”\ndefense). This is a question that this Court will have to\nconsider in due course. It is one thing to free plaintiffs\nfrom proving an employer’s illicit intent, but quite another\nto preclude the employer from proving that its motives\nwere pure and its actions reasonable.\n  The Court’s resolution of these cases makes it unneces\nsary to resolve these matters today. But the war between\ndisparate impact and equal protection will be waged\nsooner or later, and it behooves us to begin thinking about\nhow—and on what terms—to make peace between them.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

I write separately only\nbecause the dissent, while claiming that “[t]he Court’s\nrecitation of the facts leaves out important parts of the\nstory,” post, at 2 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.), provides an\nincomplete description of the events that led to New Ha\nven’s decision to reject the results of its exam. The dis\nsent’s omissions are important because, when all of the\nevidence in the record is taken into account, it is clear\nthat, even if the legal analysis in Parts II and III–A of the\ndissent were accepted, affirmance of the decision below is\nuntenable.\n                            I\n  When an employer in a disparate-treatment case under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 claims that an\nemployment decision, such as the refusal to promote, was\nbased on a legitimate reason, two questions—one objective\nand one subjective—must be decided. The first, objective\nquestion is whether the reason given by the employer is\n\f2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\none that is legitimate under Title VII. See St. Mary’s\nHonor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 506–507 (1993). If\nthe reason provided by the employer is not legitimate on\nits face, the employer is liable. Id., at 509. The second,\nsubjective question concerns the employer’s intent. If an\nemployer offers a facially legitimate reason for its decision\nbut it turns out that this explanation was just a pretext\nfor discrimination, the employer is again liable. See id., at\n510–512.\n   The question on which the opinion of the Court and the\ndissenting opinion disagree concerns the objective compo\nnent of the determination that must be made when an\nemployer justifies an employment decision, like the one\nmade in this litigation, on the ground that a contrary\ndecision would have created a risk of disparate-impact\nliability. The Court holds—and I entirely agree—that\nconcern about disparate-impact liability is a legitimate\nreason for a decision of the type involved here only if there\nwas a “substantial basis in evidence to find the tests in\nadequate.” Ante, at 26. The Court ably demonstrates that\nin this litigation no reasonable jury could find that the city\nof New Haven (City) possessed such evidence and there\nfore summary judgment for petitioners is required. Be\ncause the Court correctly holds that respondents cannot\nsatisfy this objective component, the Court has no need to\ndiscuss the question of the respondents’ actual intent. As\nthe Court puts it, “[e]ven if respondents were motivated as\na subjective matter by a desire to avoid committing dispa\nrate-impact discrimination, the record makes clear there\nis no support for the conclusion that respondents had an\nobjective, substantial basis in evidence to find the tests\ninadequate.” Ibid.\n   The dissent advocates a different objective component of\nthe governing standard. According to the dissent, the\nobjective component should be whether the evidence pro\nvided “good cause” for the decision, post, at 19, and the\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ndissent argues—incorrectly, in my view—that no reason\nable juror could fail to find that such evidence was present\nhere. But even if the dissent were correct on this point, I\nassume that the dissent would not countenance summary\njudgment for respondents if respondents’ professed con\ncern about disparate-impact litigation was simply a pre\ntext. Therefore, the decision below, which sustained the\nentry of summary judgment for respondents, cannot be\naffirmed unless no reasonable jury could find that the\nCity’s asserted reason for scrapping its test—concern\nabout disparate-impact liability—was a pretext and that\nthe City’s real reason was illegitimate, namely, the desire\nto placate a politically important racial constituency.\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n   As initially described by the dissent, see post, at 2–12,\nthe process by which the City reached the decision not to\naccept the test results was open, honest, serious, and\ndeliberative. But even the District Court admitted that “a\njury could rationally infer that city officials worked behind\nthe scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations\nbecause they knew that, were the exams certified, the\nMayor would incur the wrath of [Rev. Boise] Kimber and\nother influential leaders of New Haven’s African-American\ncommunity.” 554 F. Supp. 2d 142, 162 (Conn. 2006),\nsummarily aff’d, 530 F. 3d 87 (CA2 2008) (per curiam).\n   This admission finds ample support in the record.\nReverend Boise Kimber, to whom the District Court re\nferred, is a politically powerful New Haven pastor and a\nself-professed “ ‘kingmaker.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n07–1428, p. 906a; see also id., at 909a. On one occasion,\n“[i]n front of TV cameras, he threatened a race riot during\nthe murder trial of the black man arrested for killing\nwhite Yalie Christian Prince. He continues to call whites\nracist if they question his actions.” Id., at 931a.\n\f4                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Reverend Kimber’s personal ties with seven-term New\nHaven Mayor John DeStefano (Mayor) stretch back more\nthan a decade. In 1996, for example, Mayor DeStefano\ntestified for Rev. Kimber as a character witness when Rev.\nKimber—then the manager of a funeral home—was prose\ncuted and convicted for stealing prepaid funeral expenses\nfrom an elderly woman and then lying about the matter\nunder oath. See id., at 126a, 907a. “Reverend Kimber has\nplayed a leadership role in all of Mayor DeStefano’s politi\ncal campaigns, [and] is considered a valuable political\nsupporter and vote-getter.” Id., at 126a. According to the\nMayor’s former campaign manager (who is currently his\nexecutive assistant), Rev. Kimber is an invaluable political\nasset because “[h]e’s very good at organizing people and\nputting together field operations, as a result of his ties to\nlabor, his prominence in the religious community and his\nlong-standing commitment to roots.” Id., at 908a (internal\nquotation marks and alteration omitted).\n  In 2002, the Mayor picked Rev. Kimber to serve as the\nChairman of the New Haven Board of Fire Commissioners\n(BFC), “despite the fact that he had no experience in the\nprofession, fire administration, [or] municipal manage\nment.” Id., at 127a; see also id., at 928a–929a. In that\ncapacity, Rev. Kimber told firefighters that certain new\nrecruits would not be hired because “ ‘they just have too\nmany vowels in their name[s].’ ” Thanawala, New Haven\nFire Panel Chairman Steps Down Over Racial Slur, Hart\nford Courant, June 13, 2002, p. B2. After protests about\nthis comment, Rev. Kimber stepped down as chairman of\nthe BFC, ibid.; see also App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–\n1428, at 929a, but he remained on the BFC and retained\n“a direct line to the mayor,” id., at 816a.\n  Almost immediately after the test results were revealed\nin “early January” 2004, Rev. Kimber called the City’s\nChief Administrative Officer, Karen Dubois-Walton, who\n“acts ‘on behalf of the Mayor.’ ” Id., at 221a, 812a. Dubois\n\f                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                          ALITO, J., concurring\n\nWalton and Rev. Kimber met privately in her office be\ncause he wanted “to express his opinion” about the test\nresults and “to have some influence” over the City’s re\nsponse. Id., at 815a–816a. As discussed in further detail\nbelow, Rev. Kimber adamantly opposed certification of the\ntest results—a fact that he or someone in the Mayor’s\noffice eventually conveyed to the Mayor. Id., at 229a.\n                              B\n  On January 12, 2004, Tina Burgett (the director of the\nCity’s Department of Human Resources) sent an e-mail to\nDubois-Walton to coordinate the City’s response to the test\nresults. Burgett wanted to clarify that the City’s executive\nofficials would meet “sans the Chief, and that once we had\na better fix on the next steps we would meet with the\nMayor (possibly) and then the two Chiefs.” Id., at 446a.\nThe “two Chiefs” are Fire Chief William Grant (who is\nwhite) and Assistant Fire Chief Ronald Dumas (who is\nAfrican-American). Both chiefs believed that the test\nresults should be certified. Id., at 228a, 817a. Petitioners\nallege, and the record suggests, that the Mayor and his\nstaff colluded “sans the Chief[s]” because “the defendants\ndid not want Grant’s or Dumas’ views to be publicly\nknown; accordingly both men were prevented by the\nMayor and his staff from making any statements regard\ning the matter.” Id., at 228a.1\n  The next day, on January 13, 2004, Chad Legel, who\nhad designed the tests, flew from Chicago to New Haven\nto meet with Dubois-Walton, Burgett, and Thomas Ude,\nthe City’s corporate counsel. Id., at 179a. “Legel outlined\nthe merits of the examination and why city officials should\nbe confident in the validity of the results.” Ibid. But\n——————\n  1 Although the dissent disputes it, see post, at 33–34, n. 17, the record\ncertainly permits the inference that petitioners’ allegation is true. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, pp. 846a–851a (deposition of\nDubois-Walton).\n\f6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\naccording to Legel, Dubois-Walton was “argumentative”\nand apparently had already made up her mind that the\ntests were “ ‘discriminatory.’ ” Id., at 179a–180a. Again\naccording to Legel, “[a] theme” of the meeting was “the\npolitical and racial overtones of what was going on in the\nCity.” Id., at 181a. “Legel came away from the January\n13, 2004 meeting with the impression that defendants\nwere already leaning toward discarding the examination\nresults.” Id., at 180a.\n  On January 22, 2004, the Civil Service Board (CSB or\nBoard) convened its first public meeting. Almost immedi\nately, Rev. Kimber began to exert political pressure on the\nCSB. He began a loud, minutes-long outburst that re\nquired the CSB Chairman to shout him down and hold\nhim out of order three times. See id., at 187a, 467a–468a;\nsee also App. in No. 06–4996–cv (CA2), pp. A703–A705.\nReverend Kimber protested the public meeting, arguing\nthat he and the other fire commissioners should first be\nallowed to meet with the CSB in private. App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 07–1428, at 188a.\n  Four days after the CSB’s first meeting, Mayor DeSte\nfano’s executive aide sent an e-mail to Dubois-Walton,\nBurgett, and Ude. Id., at 190a. The message clearly\nindicated that the Mayor had made up his mind to oppose\ncertification of the test results (but nevertheless wanted to\nconceal that fact from the public):\n    “I wanted to make sure we are all on the same page\n    for this meeting tomorrow. . . . [L]et’s remember, that\n    these folks are not against certification yet. So we\n    can’t go in and tell them that is our position; we have\n    to deliberate and arrive there as the fairest and most\n    cogent outcome.” Ibid.\n  On February 5, 2004, the CSB convened its second\npublic meeting. Reverend Kimber again testified and\nthreatened the CSB with political recriminations if they\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nvoted to certify the test results:\n    “I look at this [Board] tonight. I look at three whites\n    and one Hispanic and no blacks. . . . I would hope that\n    you would not put yourself in this type of position, a\n    political ramification that may come back upon you as\n    you sit on this [Board] and decide the future of a\n    department and the future of those who are being\n    promoted.\n    .           .           .          .           .\n    “(APPLAUSE).” Id., at 492a (emphasis added).\nOne of the CSB members “t[ook] great offense” because he\nbelieved that Rev. Kimber “consider[ed] [him] a bigot\nbecause [his] face is white.” Id., at 496a. The offended\nCSB member eventually voted not to certify the test re\nsults. Id., at 586a–587a.\n   One of Rev. Kimber’s “friends and allies,” Lieutenant\nGary Tinney, also exacerbated racial tensions before the\nCSB. Id., at 129a. After some firefighters applauded in\nsupport of certifying the test results, “Lt. Tinney ex\nclaimed, ‘Listen to the Klansmen behind us.’ ” Id., at 225a.\n   Tinney also has strong ties to the Mayor’s office. See,\ne.g., id., at 129a–130a, 816a–817a. After learning that he\nhad not scored well enough on the captain’s exam to earn\na promotion, Tinney called Dubois-Walton and arranged a\nmeeting in her office. Id., at 830a–831a, 836a. Tinney\nalleged that the white firefighters had cheated on their\nexams—an accusation that Dubois-Walton conveyed to the\nBoard without first conducting an investigation into its\nveracity. Id., at 837a–838a; see also App. 164 (statement\nof CSB Chairman, noting the allegations of cheating). The\nallegation turned out to be baseless. App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 07–1428, at 836a.\n   Dubois-Walton never retracted the cheating allegation,\nbut she and other executive officials testified several times\nbefore the CSB. In accordance with directions from the\n\f8                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nMayor’s office to make the CSB meetings appear delibera\ntive, see id., at 190a, executive officials remained publicly\nuncommitted about certification—while simultaneously\n“work[ing] as a team” behind closed doors with the secre\ntary of the CSB to devise a political message that would\nconvince the CSB to vote against certification, see id., at\n447a. At the public CSB meeting on March 11, 2004, for\nexample, Corporation Counsel Ude bristled at one board\nmember’s suggestion that City officials were recommend\ning against certifying the test results. See id., at 215a\n(“Attorney Ude took offense, stating, ‘Frankly, because I\nwould never make a recommendation—I would not have\nmade a recommendation like that’ ”). But within days of\nmaking that public statement, Ude privately told other\nmembers of the Mayor’s team “the ONLY way we get to a\ndecision not to certify is” to focus on something other than\n“a big discussion re: adverse impact” law. Id., at 458a–\n459a.\n   As part of its effort to deflect attention from the specifics\nof the test, the City relied heavily on the testimony of Dr.\nChristopher Hornick, who is one of Chad Legel’s competi\ntors in the test-development business. Hornick never\n“stud[ied] the test [that Legel developed] at length or in\ndetail,” id., at 549a; see also id., at 203a, 553a, but Hor\nnick did review and rely upon literature sent to him by\nBurgett to criticize Legel’s test. For example, Hornick\n“noted in the literature that [Burgett] sent that the test\nwas not customized to the New Haven Fire Department.”\nId., at 551a. The Chairman of the CSB immediately cor\nrected Hornick. Id., at 552a (“Actually, it was, Dr. Hor\nnick”). Hornick also relied on newspaper accounts—again,\nsent to him by Burgett—pertaining to the controversy\nsurrounding the certification decision. See id., at 204a,\n557a. Although Hornick again admitted that he had no\nknowledge about the actual test that Legel had developed\nand that the City had administered, see id., at 560a–561a,\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          ALITO, J., concurring\n\nthe City repeatedly relied upon Hornick as a testing\n“guru” and, in the CSB Chairman’s words, “the City ke[pt]\nquoting him as a person that we should rely upon more\nthan anybody else [to conclude that there] is a better\nway—a better mousetrap.”2 App. in No. 06–4996–cv\n(CA2), at A1128. Dubois-Walton later admitted that the\nCity rewarded Hornick for his testimony by hiring him to\ndevelop and administer an alternative test. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 07–1428, at 854a; see also id., at 562a–\n563a (Hornick’s plea for future business from the City on\nthe basis of his criticisms of Legel’s tests).\n   At some point prior to the CSB’s public meeting on\nMarch 18, 2004, the Mayor decided to use his executive\nauthority to disregard the test results—even if the CSB\nultimately voted to certify them. Id., at 819a–820a. Ac\ncordingly, on the evening of March 17th, Dubois-Walton\nsent an e-mail to the Mayor, the Mayor’s executive assis\ntant, Burgett, and attorney Ude, attaching two alternative\npress releases.

See supra, at 5. While Hornick\nknew little or nothing about the tests he criticized, the two chiefs were\ninvolved “during the lengthy process that led to the devising of the\nadministration of these exams,” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428,\nat 847a, including “collaborating with City officials on the extensive job\nanalyses that were done,” “selection of the oral panelists,” and selection\nof “the proper content and subject matter of the exams,” id., at 847a–\n848a.\n\f10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Soon after the CSB voted against certification, Mayor\nDeStefano appeared at a dinner event and “took credit for\nthe scu[tt]ling of the examination results.” Id., at 230a.\n                              C\n   Taking into account all the evidence in the summary\njudgment record, a reasonable jury could find the follow\ning. Almost as soon as the City disclosed the racial\nmakeup of the list of firefighters who scored the highest on\nthe exam, the City administration was lobbied by an\ninfluential community leader to scrap the test results, and\nthe City administration decided on that course of action\nbefore making any real assessment of the possibility of a\ndisparate-impact violation. To achieve that end, the City\nadministration concealed its internal decision but\nworked—as things turned out, successfully—to persuade\nthe CSB that acceptance of the test results would be ille\ngal and would expose the City to disparate-impact liabil\nity. But in the event that the CSB was not persuaded, the\nMayor, wielding ultimate decisionmaking authority, was\nprepared to overrule the CSB immediately. Taking this\nview of the evidence, a reasonable jury could easily find\nthat the City’s real reason for scrapping the test results\nwas not a concern about violating the disparate-impact\nprovision of Title VII but a simple desire to please a politi\ncally important racial constituency. It is noteworthy that\nthe Solicitor General—whose position on the principal\nlegal issue in this case is largely aligned with the dis\nsent—concludes that “[n]either the district court nor the\ncourt of appeals . . . adequately considered whether, view\ning the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioners,\na genuine issue of material fact remained whether respon\ndents’ claimed purpose to comply with Title VII was a\npretext for intentional racial discrimination . . . .” Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 6; see also id., at 32–\n33.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

The dissent misrepresents my posi\ntion: I draw no such equation. Of course “there are many\nways in which a politician can attempt to win over a con\nstituency—including a racial constituency—without en\ngaging in unlawful discrimination.” Post, at 36–37. But—\nas I assume the dissent would agree—there are some\nthings that a public official cannot do, and one of those is\nengaging in intentional racial discrimination when mak\ning employment decisions.\n   The second point concerns the dissent’s main argu\nment—that efforts by the Mayor and his staff to scuttle\nthe test results are irrelevant because the ultimate deci\nsion was made by the CSB. According to the dissent,\n“[t]he relevant decision was made by the CSB,” post, at 34,\nand there is “scant cause to suspect” that anything done\nby the opponents of certification, including the Mayor and\nhis staff, “prevented the CSB from evenhandedly assess\ning the reliability of the exams and rendering an inde\npendent, good-faith decision on certification,” post, at 36.\n   Adoption of the dissent’s argument would implicitly\ndecide an important question of Title VII law that this\nCourt has never resolved—the circumstances in which an\nemployer may be held liable based on the discriminatory\nintent of subordinate employees who influence but do not\nmake the ultimate employment decision. There is a large\nbody of court of appeals case law on this issue, and these\ncases disagree about the proper standard. See EEOC v.\nBCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 450 F. 3d 476,\n484–488 (CA10 2006) (citing cases and describing the\napproaches taken in different Circuits). One standard is\nwhether the subordinate “exerted influenc[e] over the\n\f12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntitular decisionmaker.” Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Ven\nture, 235 F. 3d 219, 227 (CA5 2000); see also Poland v.\nChertoff, 494 F. 3d 1174, 1182 (CA9 2007) (A subordinate’s\nbias is imputed to the employer where the subordinate\n“influenced or was involved in the decision or decision\nmaking process”). Another is whether the discriminatory\ninput “caused the adverse employment action.” See BCI\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, supra, at 487.\n   In the present cases, a reasonable jury could certainly\nfind that these standards were met. The dissent makes\nmuch of the fact that members of the CSB swore under\noath that their votes were based on the good-faith belief\nthat certification of the results would have violated federal\nlaw. See post, at 34. But the good faith of the CSB mem\nbers would not preclude a finding that the presentations\nengineered by the Mayor and his staff influenced or\ncaused the CSB decision.\n   The least employee-friendly standard asks only whether\n“the actual decisionmaker” acted with discriminatory\nintent, see Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Management,\nInc., 354 F. 3d 277, 291 (CA4 2004) (en banc), and it is\ntelling that, even under this standard, summary judgment\nfor respondents would not be proper. This is so because a\nreasonable jury could certainly find that in New Haven,\nthe Mayor—not the CSB—wielded the final decisionmak\ning power. After all, the Mayor claimed that authority\nand was poised to use it in the event that the CSB decided\nto accept the test results. See supra, at 9. If the Mayor\nhad the authority to overrule a CSB decision accepting the\ntest results, the Mayor also presumably had the authority\nto overrule the CSB’s decision rejecting the test results. In\nlight of the Mayor’s conduct, it would be quite wrong to\nthrow out petitioners’ case on the ground that the CSB\nwas the ultimate decisionmaker.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327 (2003).\nIn 1972, Congress extended Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 to cover public employment. At that time,\nmunicipal fire departments across the country, including\nNew Haven’s, pervasively discriminated against minori\nties. The extension of Title VII to cover jobs in firefighting\neffected no overnight change. It took decades of persistent\neffort, advanced by Title VII litigation, to open firefighting\nposts to members of racial minorities.\n   The white firefighters who scored high on New Haven’s\npromotional exams understandably attract this Court’s\nsympathy. But they had no vested right to promotion.\nNor have other persons received promotions in preference\nto them.

In so holding, the Court pretends\nthat “[t]he City rejected the test results solely because the\nhigher scoring candidates were white.” Ante, at 20. That\npretension, essential to the Court’s disposition, ignores\nsubstantial evidence of multiple flaws in the tests New\nHaven used. The Court similarly fails to acknowledge the\nbetter tests used in other cities, which have yielded less\nracially skewed outcomes.1\n   By order of this Court, New Haven, a city in which\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics account for nearly 60\npercent of the population, must today be served—as it was\nin the days of undisguised discrimination—by a fire de\npartment in which members of racial and ethnic minori\nties are rarely seen in command positions. In arriving at\nits order, the Court barely acknowledges the pathmarking\ndecision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971),\nwhich explained the centrality of the disparate-impact\nconcept to effective enforcement of Title VII. The Court’s\norder and opinion, I anticipate, will not have staying\npower.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Court’s recitation of the facts leaves out important\nparts of the story.

See ante, at 4–9. Even\na detached and disinterested observer, however, would have every\nreason to ask: Why did such racially skewed results occur in New\nHaven, when better tests likely would have produced less dispropor\ntionate results?\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

R. Rep. No. 92–\n238, p. 17 (1971). According to the report, overt racism\nwas partly to blame, but so too was a failure on the part of\nmunicipal employers to apply merit-based employment\nprinciples. In making hiring and promotion decisions,\npublic employers often “rel[ied] on criteria unrelated to job\nperformance,” including nepotism or political patronage.\n118 Cong. Rec. 1817 (1972). Such flawed selection meth\nods served to entrench preexisting racial hierarchies. The\nUSCCR report singled out police and fire departments for\nhaving “[b]arriers to equal employment . . . greater . . .\nthan in any other area of State or local government,” with\nAfrican-Americans “hold[ing] almost no positions in the\nofficer ranks.” Ibid. See also National Commission on\nFire Prevention and Control, America Burning 5 (1973)\n(“Racial minorities are under-represented in the fire de\npartments in nearly every community in which they\nlive.”).\n   The city of New Haven (City) was no exception. In the\nearly 1970’s, African-Americans and Hispanics composed\n30 percent of New Haven’s population, but only 3.6 per\ncent of the City’s 502 firefighters. The racial disparity in\nthe officer ranks was even more pronounced: “[O]f the 107\nofficers in the Department only one was black, and he held\nthe lowest rank above private.” Firebird Soc. of New\nHaven, Inc. v. New Haven Bd. of Fire Comm’rs, 66 F. R. D.\n457, 460 (Conn. 1975).\n   Following a lawsuit and settlement agreement, see ibid.,\nthe City initiated efforts to increase minority representa\ntion in the New Haven Fire Department (Department).\nThose litigation-induced efforts produced some positive\nchange. New Haven’s population includes a greater pro\nportion of minorities today than it did in the 1970’s:\nNearly 40 percent of the City’s residents are African\n\f4                   RICCI v.

Among\nentry-level firefighters, minorities are still underrepre\nsented, but not starkly so. As of 2003, African-Americans\nand Hispanics constituted 30 percent and 16 percent of the\nCity’s firefighters, respectively. In supervisory positions,\nhowever, significant disparities remain. Overall, the\nsenior officer ranks (captain and higher) are nine percent\nAfrican-American and nine percent Hispanic. Only one of\nthe Department’s 21 fire captains is African-American.\nSee App. in No. 06–4996–cv (CA2), p. A1588 (hereinafter\nCA2 App.). It is against this backdrop of entrenched\ninequality that the promotion process at issue in this\nlitigation should be assessed.\n                             B\n   By order of its charter, New Haven must use competi\ntive examinations to fill vacancies in fire officer and other\ncivil-service positions. Such examinations, the City’s civil\nservice rules specify, “shall be practical in nature, shall\nrelate to matters which fairly measure the relative fitness\nand capacity of the applicants to discharge the duties of\nthe position which they seek, and shall take into account\ncharacter, training, experience, physical and mental fit\nness.” Id., at A331. The City may choose among a variety\nof testing methods, including written and oral exams and\n“[p]erformance tests to demonstrate skill and ability in\nperforming actual work.” Id., at A332.\n   New Haven, the record indicates, did not closely con\nsider what sort of “practical” examination would “fairly\nmeasure the relative fitness and capacity of the applicants\nto discharge the duties” of a fire officer. Instead, the City\nsimply adhered to the testing regime outlined in its two\ndecades-old contract with the local firefighters’ union: a\nwritten exam, which would account for 60 percent of an\napplicant’s total score, and an oral exam, which would\naccount for the remaining 40 percent. Id., at A1045. In\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsoliciting bids from exam development companies, New\nHaven made clear that it would entertain only “proposals\nthat include a written component that will be weighted at\n60%, and an oral component that will be weighted at\n40%.” Id., at A342. Chad Legel, a representative of the\nwinning bidder, Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc.\n(IOS), testified during his deposition that the City never\nasked whether alternative methods might better measure\nthe qualities of a successful fire officer, including leader\nship skills and command presence. See id., at A522 (“I\nwas under contract and had responsibility only to create\nthe oral interview and the written exam.”).\n   Pursuant to New Haven’s specifications, IOS developed\nand administered the oral and written exams. The results\nshowed significant racial disparities. On the lieutenant\nexam, the pass rate for African-American candidates was\nabout one-half the rate for Caucasian candidates; the pass\nrate for Hispanic candidates was even lower. On the\ncaptain exam, both African-American and Hispanic candi\ndates passed at about half the rate of their Caucasian\ncounterparts. See App. 225–226. More striking still,\nalthough nearly half of the 77 lieutenant candidates were\nAfrican-American or Hispanic, none would have been\neligible for promotion to the eight positions then vacant.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n13th; the top Hispanic candidate was 26th. As for the\nseven then-vacant captain positions, two Hispanic candi\ndates would have been eligible, but no African-Americans.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n15th. See id., at 218–219.\n   These stark disparities, the Court acknowledges, suf\nficed to state a prima facie case under Title VII’s dispa\nrate-impact provision. See ante, at 27 (“The pass rates of\nminorities . . . f[e]ll well below the 80-percent standard set\nby the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC)] to implement the disparate-impact provision of\n\f6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nTitle VII.”). New Haven thus had cause for concern about\nthe prospect of Title VII litigation and liability. City\nofficials referred the matter to the New Haven Civil Ser\nvice Board (CSB), the entity responsible for certifying the\nresults of employment exams.\n   Between January and March 2004, the CSB held five\npublic meetings to consider the proper course. At the first\nmeeting, New Haven’s Corporation Counsel, Thomas Ude,\ndescribed the legal standard governing Title VII disparate\nimpact claims. Statistical imbalances alone, Ude correctly\nrecognized, do not give rise to liability. Instead, presented\nwith a disparity, an employer “has the opportunity and the\nburden of proving that the test is job-related and consis\ntent with business necessity.” CA2 App. A724. A Title VII\nplaintiff may attempt to rebut an employer’s showing of\njob-relatedness and necessity by identifying alternative\nselection methods that would have been at least as valid\nbut with “less of an adverse or disparate or discriminatory\neffect.” Ibid. See also id., at A738. Accordingly, the CSB\nCommissioners understood, their principal task was to\ndecide whether they were confident about the reliability of\nthe exams: Had the exams fairly measured the qualities of\na successful fire officer despite their disparate results?\nMight an alternative examination process have identified\nthe most qualified candidates without creating such sig\nnificant racial imbalances?\n   Seeking a range of input on these questions, the CSB\nheard from test takers, the test designer, subject-matter\nexperts, City officials, union leaders, and community\nmembers. Several candidates for promotion, who did not\nyet know their exam results, spoke at the CSB’s first two\nmeetings. Some candidates favored certification. The\nexams, they emphasized, had closely tracked the assigned\nstudy materials. Having invested substantial time and\nmoney to prepare themselves for the test, they felt it\nwould be unfair to scrap the results. See, e.g., id., at\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nA772–A773, A785–A789.\n   Other firefighters had a different view. A number of the\nexam questions, they pointed out, were not germane to\nNew Haven’s practices and procedures. See, e.g., id., at\nA774–A784. At least two candidates opposed to certifica\ntion noted unequal access to study materials. Some indi\nviduals, they asserted, had the necessary books even\nbefore the syllabus was issued. Others had to invest\nsubstantial sums to purchase the materials and “wait a\nmonth and a half for some of the books because they were\non back-order.” Id., at A858. These disparities, it was\nsuggested, fell at least in part along racial lines. While\nmany Caucasian applicants could obtain materials and\nassistance from relatives in the fire service, the over\nwhelming majority of minority applicants were “first\ngeneration firefighters” without such support networks.\nSee id., at A857–A861, A886–A887.\n   A representative of the Northeast Region of the Interna\ntional Association of Black Professional Firefighters,\nDonald Day, also spoke at the second meeting. Statistical\ndisparities, he told the CSB, had been present in the\nDepartment’s previous promotional exams. On earlier\ntests, however, a few minority candidates had fared well\nenough to earn promotions. Id., at A828. See also App.\n218–219. Day contrasted New Haven’s experience with\nthat of nearby Bridgeport, where minority firefighters held\none-third of lieutenant and captain positions. Bridgeport,\nDay observed, had once used a testing process similar to\nNew Haven’s, with a written exam accounting for 70\npercent of an applicant’s score, an oral exam for 25 per\ncent, and seniority for the remaining five percent. CA2\nApp. A830. Bridgeport recognized, however, that the oral\ncomponent, more so than the written component, ad\ndressed the sort of “real-life scenarios” fire officers encoun\nter on the job. Id., at A832. Accordingly, that city\n“changed the relative weights” to give primacy to the oral\n\f8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nexam. Ibid. Since that time, Day reported, Bridgeport\nhad seen minorities “fairly represented” in its exam re\nsults. Ibid.\n   The CSB’s third meeting featured IOS representative\nLegel, the leader of the team that had designed and ad\nministered the exams for New Haven. Several City offi\ncials also participated in the discussion. Legel described\nthe exam development process in detail. The City, he\nrecounted, had set the “parameters” for the exams, specifi\ncally, the requirement of written and oral components\nwith a 60/40 weighting. Id., at A923, A974. For security\nreasons, Department officials had not been permitted to\ncheck the content of the questions prior to their admini\nstration. Instead, IOS retained a senior fire officer from\nGeorgia to review the exams “for content and fidelity to\nthe source material.” Id., at A936. Legel defended the\nexams as “facially neutral,” and stated that he “would\nstand by the[ir] validity.” Id., at A962. City officials did\nnot dispute the neutrality of IOS’s work. But, they cau\ntioned, even if individual exam questions had no intrinsic\nbias, the selection process as a whole may nevertheless\nhave been deficient. The officials urged the CSB to consult\nwith experts about the “larger picture.” Id., at A1012.\n   At its fourth meeting, CSB solicited the views of three\nindividuals with testing-related expertise. Dr. Christo\npher Hornick, an industrial/organizational psychology\nconsultant with 25 years’ experience with police and fire\nfighter testing, described the exam results as having\n“relatively high adverse impact.” Id., at A1028. Most of\nthe tests he had developed, Hornick stated, exhibited\n“significantly and dramatically less adverse impact.” Id.,\nat A1029. Hornick downplayed the notion of “facial neu\ntrality.” It was more important, he advised the CSB, to\nconsider “the broader issue of how your procedures and\nyour rules and the types of tests that you are using are\ncontributing to the adverse impact.” Id., at A1038.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n    Specifically, Hornick questioned New Haven’s union\nprompted 60/40 written/oral examination structure, noting\nthe availability of “different types of testing procedures\nthat are much more valid in terms of identifying the best\npotential supervisors in [the] fire department.” Id., at\nA1032. He suggested, for example, “an assessment center\nprocess, which is essentially an opportunity for candidates\n. . . to demonstrate how they would address a particular\nproblem as opposed to just verbally saying it or identifying\nthe correct option on a written test.” Id., at A1039–A1040.\nSuch selection processes, Hornick said, better “identif[y]\nthe best possible people” and “demonstrate dramatically\nless adverse impacts.” Ibid. Hornick added:\n    “I’ve spoken to at least 10,000, maybe 15,000 fire\n    fighters in group settings in my consulting practice\n    and I have never one time ever had anyone in the fire\n    service say to me, ‘Well, the person who answers—\n    gets the highest score on a written job knowledge,\n    multiple-guess test makes the best company officer.’\n    We know that it’s not as valid as other procedures\n    that exist.” Id., at A1033.\nSee also id., at A1042–A1043 (“I think a person’s leader\nship skills, their command presence, their interpersonal\nskills, their management skills, their tactical skills could\nhave been identified and evaluated in a much more appro\npriate way.”).\n   Hornick described the written test itself as “reasonably\ngood,” id., at A1041, but he criticized the decision not to\nallow Department officials to check the content. According\nto Hornick, this “inevitably” led to “test[ing] for processes\nand procedures that don’t necessarily match up into the\ndepartment.” Id., at A1034–A1035. He preferred “experts\nfrom within the department who have signed confidential\nity agreements . . . to make sure that the terminology and\nequipment that’s being identified from standardized read\n\f10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ning sources apply to the department.” Id., at A1035.\n   Asked whether he thought the City should certify the\nresults, Hornick hedged: “There is adverse impact in the\ntest. That will be identified in any proceeding that you\nhave. You will have industrial psychology experts, if it\ngoes to court, on both sides. And it will not be a pretty or\ncomfortable position for anyone to be in.” Id., at A1040–\nA1041. Perhaps, he suggested, New Haven might certify\nthe results but immediately begin exploring “alternative\nways to deal with these issues” in the future. Id., at\nA1041.\n   The two other witnesses made relatively brief appear\nances. Vincent Lewis, a specialist with the Department of\nHomeland Security and former fire officer in Michigan,\nbelieved the exams had generally tested relevant material,\nalthough he noted a relatively heavy emphasis on ques\ntions pertaining to being an “apparatus driver.” He sug\ngested that this may have disadvantaged test takers “who\nhad not had the training or had not had an opportunity to\ndrive the apparatus.” Id., at A1051. He also urged the\nCSB to consider whether candidates had, in fact, enjoyed\nequal access to the study materials. Ibid. Cf. supra, at 7.\n   Janet Helms, a professor of counseling psychology at\nBoston College, observed that two-thirds of the incumbent\nfire officers who submitted job analyses to IOS during the\nexam design phase were Caucasian. Members of different\nracial groups, Helms told the CSB, sometimes do their jobs\nin different ways, “often because the experiences that are\nopen to white male firefighters are not open to members of\nthese other under-represented groups.” CA2 App. A1063–\nA1064. The heavy reliance on job analyses from white\nfirefighters, she suggested, may thus have introduced an\nelement of bias. Id., at A1063.\n   The CSB’s fifth and final meeting began with state\nments from City officials recommending against certifica\ntion. Ude, New Haven’s counsel, repeated the applicable\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndisparate-impact standard:\n    “[A] finding of adverse impact is the beginning, not\n    the end, of a review of testing procedures. Where a\n    procedure demonstrates adverse impact, you look to\n    how closely it is related to the job that you’re looking\n    to fill and you also look at whether there are other\n    ways to test for those qualities, those traits, those po\n    sitions that are equally valid with less adverse im\n    pact.” Id., at A1100–A1101.\nNew Haven, Ude and other officials asserted, would be\nvulnerable to Title VII liability under this standard. Even\nif the exams were “facially neutral,” significant doubts had\nbeen raised about whether they properly assessed the key\nattributes of a successful fire officer. Id., at A1103. See\nalso id., at A1125 (“Upon close reading of the exams, the\nquestions themselves would appear to test a candidate’s\nability to memorize textbooks but not necessarily to iden\ntify solutions to real problems on the fire ground.”). More\nover, City officials reminded the CSB, Hornick and others\nhad identified better, less discriminatory selection meth\nods–such as assessment centers or exams with a more\nheavily weighted oral component. Id., at A1108–A1109,\nA1129–A1130.\n   After giving members of the public a final chance to\nweigh in, the CSB voted on certification, dividing 2 to 2.\nBy rule, the result was noncertification. Voting no, Com\nmissioner Webber stated, “I originally was going to vote to\ncertify. . . . But I’ve heard enough testimony here to give\nme great doubts about the test itself and . . . some of the\nprocedures. And I believe we can do better.” Id., at\nA1157. Commissioner Tirado likewise concluded that the\n“flawed” testing process counseled against certification.\nId., at A1158. Chairman Segaloff and Commissioner\nCaplan voted to certify. According to Segaloff, the testi\nmony had not “compelled [him] to say this exam was not\n\f12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\njob-related,” and he was unconvinced that alternative\nselection processes would be “less discriminatory.” Id., at\nA1159–A1160. Both Segalhoff and Caplan, however,\nurged the City to undertake civil service reform. Id., at\nA1150–A1154.\n                                C\n   Following the CSB’s vote, petitioners—17 white fire\nfighters and one Hispanic firefighter, all of whom had high\nmarks on the exams—filed suit in the United States Dis\ntrict Court for the District of Connecticut. They named as\ndefendants—respondents here—the City, several City\nofficials, a local political activist, and the two CSB mem\nbers who voted against certifying the results. By opposing\ncertification, petitioners alleged, respondents had dis\ncriminated against them in violation of Title VII’s dispa\nrate-treatment provision and the Fourteenth Amend\nment’s Equal Protection Clause. The decision not to\ncertify, respondents answered, was a lawful effort to com\nply with Title VII’s disparate-impact provision and thus\ncould not have run afoul of Title VII’s prohibition of dispa\nrate treatment. Characterizing respondents’ stated ra\ntionale as a mere pretext, petitioners insisted that New\nHaven would have had a solid defense to any disparate\nimpact suit.\n   In a decision summarily affirmed by the Court of Ap\npeals, the District Court granted summary judgment for\nrespondents. 554 F. Supp. 2d 142 (Conn. 2006), aff’d, 530\nF. 3d 87 (CA2 2008) (per curiam). Under Second Circuit\nprecedent, the District Court explained, “the intent to\nremedy the disparate impact” of a promotional exam “is\nnot equivalent to an intent to discriminate against non\nminority applicants.” 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 157 (quoting\nHayden v. County of Nassau, 180 F. 3d 42, 51 (CA2 1999)).\nRejecting petitioners’ pretext argument, the court ob\nserved that the exam results were sufficiently skewed “to\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

Supp. 2d, at 158.\nHad New Haven gone forward with certification and been\nsued by aggrieved minority test takers, the City would\nhave been forced to defend tests that were presumptively\ninvalid. And, as the CSB testimony of Hornick and others\nindicated, overcoming that presumption would have been\nno easy task. Id., at 153–156. Given Title VII’s preference\nfor voluntary compliance, the court held, New Haven could\nlawfully discard the disputed exams even if the City had\nnot definitively “pinpoint[ed]” the source of the disparity\nand “ha[d] not yet formulated a better selection method.”\nId., at 156.\n  Respondents were no doubt conscious of race during\ntheir decisionmaking process, the court acknowledged, but\nthis did not mean they had engaged in racially disparate\ntreatment. The conclusion they had reached and the\naction thereupon taken were race-neutral in this sense:\n“[A]ll the test results were discarded, no one was pro\nmoted, and firefighters of every race will have to partici\npate in another selection process to be considered for\npromotion.” Id., at 158. New Haven’s action, which gave\nno individual a preference, “was ‘simply not analogous to a\nquota system or a minority set-aside where candidates, on\nthe basis of their race, are not treated uniformly.’ ” Id., at\n157 (quoting Hayden, 180 F. 3d, at 50). For these and\nother reasons, the court also rejected petitioners’ equal\nprotection claim.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  Title VII became effective in July 1965. Employers\nresponded to the law by eliminating rules and practices\nthat explicitly barred racial minorities from “white” jobs.\nBut removing overtly race-based job classifications did not\nusher in genuinely equal opportunity. More subtle—and\n\f14                       RICCI v.

S. 424 (1971), this\nCourt responded to that reality and supplied important\nguidance on Title VII’s mission and scope. Congress, the\nlandmark decision recognized, aimed beyond “disparate\ntreatment”; it targeted “disparate impact” as well. Title\nVII’s original text, it was plain to the Court, “proscribe[d]\nnot only overt discrimination but also practices that are\nfair in form, but discriminatory in operation.” Id., at 431.2\nOnly by ignoring Griggs could one maintain that inten\ntionally disparate treatment alone was Title VII’s “origi\nnal, foundational prohibition,” and disparate impact a\nmere afterthought. Cf. ante, at 21.\n   Griggs addressed Duke Power Company’s policy that\napplicants for positions, save in the company’s labor de\npartment, be high school graduates and score satisfacto\nrily on two professionally prepared aptitude tests.\n“[T]here was no showing of a discriminatory purpose in\nthe adoption of the diploma and test requirements.” 401\nU. S., at 428. The policy, however, “operated to render\nineligible a markedly disproportionate number of [African-\nAmericans].” Id., at 429. At the time of the litigation, in\n——————\n  2 The  Court’s disparate-impact analysis rested on two provisions of\nTitle VII: §703(a)(2), which made it unlawful for an employer “to limit,\nsegregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or\ntend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or other\nwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such indi\nvidual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”; and §703(h), which\npermitted employers “to act upon the results of any professionally\ndeveloped ability test provided that such test, its administration or\naction upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discrimi\nnate because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” Griggs v.\nDuke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, 426, n. 1 (1971) (quoting 78 Stat. 255,\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(2), (h) (1964 ed.)). See also 401 U. S., at 433–\n436 (explaining that §703(h) authorizes only tests that are “demonstra\nbly a reasonable measure of job performance”).\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

Id., at 430,\nn. 6. African-Americans also failed the aptitude tests at a\nsignificantly higher rate than whites. Ibid. Neither re\nquirement had been “shown to bear a demonstrable rela\ntionship to successful performance of the jobs for which it\nwas used.” Id., at 431.\n   The Court unanimously held that the company’s di\nploma and test requirements violated Title VII. “[T]o\nachieve equality of employment opportunities,” the Court\ncomprehended, Congress “directed the thrust of the Act to\nthe consequences of employment practices, not simply the\nmotivation.” Id., at 429, 432. That meant “unnecessary\nbarriers to employment” must fall, even if “neutral on\ntheir face” and “neutral in terms of intent.” Id., at 430,\n431. “The touchstone” for determining whether a test or\nqualification meets Title VII’s measure, the Court said, is\nnot “good intent or the absence of discriminatory intent”; it\nis “business necessity.” Id., at 431, 432. Matching proce\ndure to substance, the Griggs Court observed, Congress\n“placed on the employer the burden of showing that any\ngiven requirement . . . ha[s] a manifest relationship to the\nemployment in question.” Id., at 432.\n   In Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405 (1975),\nthe Court, again without dissent, elaborated on Griggs.\nWhen an employment test “select[s] applicants for hire or\npromotion in a racial pattern significantly different from\nthe pool of applicants,” the Court reiterated, the employer\nmust demonstrate a “manifest relationship” between test\nand job. 422 U. S., at 425. Such a showing, the Court\ncautioned, does not necessarily mean the employer pre\nvails: “[I]t remains open to the complaining party to show\nthat other tests or selection devices, without a similarly\nundesirable racial effect, would also serve the employer’s\nlegitimate interest in ‘efficient and trustworthy workman\n\f16                       RICCI v.

Practices dis\ncriminatory in effect, courts repeatedly emphasized, could\nbe maintained only upon an employer’s showing of “an\noverriding and compelling business purpose.” Chrisner v.\nComplete Auto Transit, Inc., 645 F. 2d 1251, 1261, n. 9\n(CA6 1981).3 That a practice served “legitimate manage\nment functions” did not, it was generally understood,\nsuffice to establish business necessity.

Atonio, 490 U. S. 642 (1989), a bare majority of this\nCourt significantly modified the Griggs-Albemarle delinea\ntion of Title VII’s disparate-impact proscription. As to\nbusiness necessity for a practice that disproportionately\nexcludes members of minority groups, Wards Cove held,\nthe employer bears only the burden of production, not the\nburden of persuasion. 490 U. S., at 659–660. And in place\nof the instruction that the challenged practice “must have\na manifest relationship to the employment in question,”\nGriggs, 401 U. S., at 432, Wards Cove said that the prac\ntice would be permissible as long as it “serve[d], in a sig\nnificant way, the legitimate employment goals of the\nemployer.” 490 U. S., at 659.\n   In response to Wards Cove and “a number of [other]\nrecent decisions by the United States Supreme Court that\nsharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness of [civil\nrights] laws,” Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of\n1991. H. R. Rep. No. 102–40, pt. 2, p. 2 (1991). Among the\n1991 alterations, Congress formally codified the disparate\nimpact component of Title VII. In so amending the stat\nute, Congress made plain its intention to restore “the\nconcepts of ‘business necessity’ and ‘job related’ enunciated\nby the Supreme Court in Griggs v.

S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). If the employer carries that\nsubstantial burden, the complainant may respond by\nidentifying “an alternative employment practice” which\nthe employer “refuses to adopt.” §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii), (C).\n                               B\n    Neither Congress’ enactments nor this Court’s Title VII\nprecedents (including the now-discredited decision in\nWards Cove) offer even a hint of “conflict” between an\nemployer’s obligations under the statute’s disparate\ntreatment and disparate-impact provisions. Cf. ante, at\n20. Standing on an equal footing, these twin pillars of\nTitle VII advance the same objectives: ending workplace\ndiscrimination and promoting genuinely equal opportu\nnity. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S.\n792, 800 (1973).\n   Yet the Court today sets at odds the statute’s core direc\ntives. When an employer changes an employment practice\nin an effort to comply with Title VII’s disparate-impact\nprovision, the Court reasons, it acts “because of race”—\nsomething Title VII’s disparate-treatment provision, see\n§2000e–2(a)(1), generally forbids. Ante, at 20. This char\nacterization of an employer’s compliance-directed action\nshows little attention to Congress’ design or to the Griggs\nline of cases Congress recognized as pathmarking.\n   “[O]ur task in interpreting separate provisions of a\nsingle Act is to give the Act the most harmonious, compre\nhensive meaning possible in light of the legislative policy\nand purpose.” Weinberger v.

Here, Title VII’s disparate-treatment\nand disparate-impact proscriptions must be read as\ncomplementary.\n  In codifying the Griggs and Albemarle instructions,\nCongress declared unambiguously that selection criteria\noperating to the disadvantage of minority group members\ncan be retained only if justified by business necessity.5 In\nkeeping with Congress’ design, employers who reject such\ncriteria due to reasonable doubts about their reliability\ncan hardly be held to have engaged in discrimination\n“because of” race. A reasonable endeavor to comply with\nthe law and to ensure that qualified candidates of all races\nhave a fair opportunity to compete is simply not what\nCongress meant to interdict. I would therefore hold that\nan employer who jettisons a selection device when its\ndisproportionate racial impact becomes apparent does not\nviolate Title VII’s disparate-treatment bar automatically\nor at all, subject to this key condition: The employer must\nhave good cause to believe the device would not withstand\nexamination for business necessity. Cf. Faragher v. Boca\nRaton, 524 U. S. 775, 806 (1998) (observing that it accords\nwith “clear statutory policy” for employers “to prevent\nviolations” and “make reasonable efforts to discharge their\nduty” under Title VII).\n  EEOC’s interpretative guidelines are corroborative.\n“[B]y the enactment of title VII,” the guidelines state,\n“Congress did not intend to expose those who comply with\nthe Act to charges that they are violating the very statute\nthey are seeking to implement.” 29 CFR §1608.1(a)\n(2008).

DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nunder Title VII, we have previously accorded the Commis\nsion’s position respectful consideration. See, e.g., Albe­\nmarle, 422 U. S., at 431; Griggs, 401 U. S., at 434. Yet the\nCourt today does not so much as mention EEOC’s counsel.\n   Our precedents defining the contours of Title VII’s\ndisparate-treatment prohibition further confirm the ab\nsence of any intra-statutory discord. In Johnson v. Trans­\nportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616 (1987),\nwe upheld a municipal employer’s voluntary affirmative\naction plan against a disparate-treatment challenge.\nPursuant to the plan, the employer selected a woman for a\nroad-dispatcher position, a job category traditionally\nregarded as “male.” A male applicant who had a slightly\nhigher interview score brought suit under Title VII. This\nCourt rejected his claim and approved the plan, which\nallowed consideration of gender as “one of numerous fac\ntors.” Id., at 638. Such consideration, we said, is “fully\nconsistent with Title VII” because plans of that order can\naid “in eliminating the vestiges of discrimination in the\nworkplace.” Id., at 642.\n   This litigation does not involve affirmative action. But\nif the voluntary affirmative action at issue in Johnson\ndoes not discriminate within the meaning of Title VII,\nneither does an employer’s reasonable effort to comply\nwith Title VII’s disparate-impact provision by refrain-\ning from action of doubtful consistency with business\nnecessity.\n                            C\n  To “reconcile” the supposed “conflict” between disparate\ntreatment and disparate impact, the Court offers an enig\nmatic standard. Ante, at 20. Employers may attempt to\ncomply with Title VII’s disparate-impact provision, the\nCourt declares, only where there is a “strong basis in\nevidence” documenting the necessity of their action.

The Equal Protec\ntion Clause, this Court has held, prohibits only intentional\ndiscrimination; it does not have a disparate-impact com\nponent. See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney,\n442 U. S. 256, 272 (1979); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.\n229, 239 (1976). Title VII, in contrast, aims to eliminate\nall forms of employment discrimination, unintentional as\nwell as deliberate. Until today, cf. ante, at 25; ante, p. 1\n(SCALIA, J., concurring), this Court has never questioned\nthe constitutionality of the disparate-impact component of\nTitle VII, and for good reason. By instructing employers\nto avoid needlessly exclusionary selection processes, Title\nVII’s disparate-impact provision calls for a “race-neutral\nmeans to increase minority . . . participation”—something\nthis Court’s equal protection precedents also encourage.\nSee Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 238\n(1995) (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.\n469, 507 (1989)). “The very radicalism of holding dispa\nrate impact doctrine unconstitutional as a matter of equal\nprotection,” moreover, “suggests that only a very uncom\npromising court would issue such a decision.” Primus,\nEqual Protection and Disparate Impact: Round Three, 117\nHarv. L. Rev. 493, 585 (2003).\n   The cases from which the Court draws its strong-basis\nin-evidence standard are particularly inapt; they concern\nthe constitutionality of absolute racial preferences. See\nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277 (1986)\n(plurality opinion) (invalidating a school district’s plan to\nlay off nonminority teachers while retaining minority\nteachers with less seniority); Croson, 488 U. S., at 499–500\n\f22                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n(rejecting a set-aside program for minority contractors\nthat operated as “an unyielding racial quota”). An em\nployer’s effort to avoid Title VII liability by repudiating a\nsuspect selection method scarcely resembles those cases.\nRace was not merely a relevant consideration in Wygant\nand Croson; it was the decisive factor. Observance of Title\nVII’s disparate-impact provision, in contrast, calls for no\nracial preference, absolute or otherwise. The very purpose\nof the provision is to ensure that individuals are hired and\npromoted based on qualifications manifestly necessary to\nsuccessful performance of the job in question, qualifica\ntions that do not screen out members of any race.6\n                             2\n  The Court’s decision in this litigation underplays a\ndominant Title VII theme. This Court has repeatedly\nemphasized that the statute “should not be read to\nthwart” efforts at voluntary compliance. Johnson, 480\nU. S., at 630. Such compliance, we have explained, is “the\npreferred means of achieving [Title VII’s] objectives.”\nFirefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 515 (1986). See\nalso Kolstad v. American Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526, 545\n(1999) (“Dissuading employers from [taking voluntary\naction] to prevent discrimination in the workplace is di\nrectly contrary to the purposes underlying Title VII.”); 29\n——————\n  6 Even in Title VII cases involving race-conscious (or gender\n\nconscious) affirmative-action plans, the Court has never proposed a\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard.      In Johnson v. Transportation\nAgency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616 (1987), the Court simply\nexamined the municipal employer’s action for reasonableness: “Given\nthe obvious imbalance in the Skilled Craft category, and given the\nAgency’s commitment to eliminating such imbalances, it was plainly\nnot unreasonable for the Agency . . . to consider as one factor the sex of\n[applicants] in making its decision.” Id., at 637. See also Firefighters v.\nCleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 516 (1986) (“Title VII permits employers and\nunions voluntarily to make use of reasonable race-conscious affirmative\naction.”).\n\f                    Cite as: 557 U.

The strong-basis-in-evidence standard,\nhowever, as barely described in general, and cavalierly\napplied in this case, makes voluntary compliance a haz\nardous venture.\n   As a result of today’s decision, an employer who discards\na dubious selection process can anticipate costly disparate\ntreatment litigation in which its chances for success—even\nfor surviving a summary-judgment motion—are highly\nproblematic. Concern about exposure to disparate-impact\nliability, however well grounded, is insufficient to insulate\nan employer from attack. Instead, the employer must\nmake a “strong” showing that (1) its selection method was\n“not job related and consistent with business necessity,” or\n(2) that it refused to adopt “an equally valid, less\ndiscriminatory alternative.” Ante, at 28. It is hard to see\nhow these requirements differ from demanding that an\nemployer establish “a provable, actual violation” against\nitself. Cf. ante, at 24. There is indeed a sharp conflict\nhere, but it is not the false one the Court describes be\ntween Title VII’s core provisions. It is, instead, the discor\ndance of the Court’s opinion with the voluntary compli\nance ideal. Cf. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 290 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“The\nimposition of a requirement that public employers make\nfindings that they have engaged in illegal discrimina-\ntion before they [act] would severely undermine public\nemployers’ incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights\nobligations.”).7\n——————\n  7 Notably,prior decisions applying a strong-basis-in-evidence stan\ndard have not imposed a burden as heavy as the one the Court imposes\ntoday. In Croson, the Court found no strong basis in evidence because\nthe City had offered “nothing approaching a prima facie case.” Rich­\nmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 500 (1989). The Court did not\nsuggest that anything beyond a prima facie case would have been\nrequired. In the context of race-based electoral districting, the Court\nhas indicated that a “strong basis” exists when the “threshold condi\n\f24                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                               3\n  The Court’s additional justifications for announcing a\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard are unimpressive.\nFirst, discarding the results of tests, the Court suggests,\ncalls for a heightened standard because it “upset[s] an\nemployee’s legitimate expectation.” Ante, at 25. This\nrationale puts the cart before the horse. The legitimacy of\nan employee’s expectation depends on the legitimacy of the\nselection method. If an employer reasonably concludes\nthat an exam fails to identify the most qualified individu\nals and needlessly shuts out a segment of the applicant\npool, Title VII surely does not compel the employer to hire\nor promote based on the test, however unreliable it may\nbe. Indeed, the statute’s prime objective is to prevent\nexclusionary practices from “operat[ing] to ‘freeze’ the\nstatus quo.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at 430.\n  Second, the Court suggests, anything less than a strong\nbasis-in-evidence standard risks creating “a de facto quota\nsystem, in which . . . an employer could discard test re\nsults . . . with the intent of obtaining the employer’s pre\nferred racial balance.” Ante, at 22. Under a reasonable\nness standard, however, an employer could not cast aside\na selection method based on a statistical disparity alone.8\nThe employer must have good cause to believe that the\nmethod screens out qualified applicants and would be\ndifficult to justify as grounded in business necessity.\n\n——————\ntions” for liability are present. Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 978 (1996)\n(plurality opinion).\n   8 Infecting the Court’s entire analysis is its insistence that the City\n\nrejected the test results “in sole reliance upon race-based statistics.”\nAnte, at 24. See also ante, at 20, 27–28. But as the part of the story the\nCourt leaves out, see supra, at 2–12, so plainly shows—the long history\nof rank discrimination against African-Americans in the firefighting\nprofession, the multiple flaws in New Haven’s test for promotions—\n“sole reliance” on statistics certainly is not descriptive of the CSB’s\ndecision.\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    25\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nShould an employer repeatedly reject test results, it would\nbe fair, I agree, to infer that the employer is simply seek\ning a racially balanced outcome and is not genuinely\nendeavoring to comply with Title VII.\n                             D\n  The Court stacks the deck further by denying respon\ndents any chance to satisfy the newly announced strong\nbasis-in-evidence standard. When this Court formulates a\nnew legal rule, the ordinary course is to remand and allow\nthe lower courts to apply the rule in the first instance.\nSee, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515 (2005);\nPullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 291 (1982). I\nsee no good reason why the Court fails to follow that\ncourse in this case. Indeed, the sole basis for the Court’s\nperemptory ruling is the demonstrably false pretension\nthat respondents showed “nothing more” than “a signifi\ncant statistical disparity.” Ante, at 27–28; see supra, at\n24, n. 8. 9\n\n——————\n  9 The  Court’s refusal to remand for further proceedings also deprives\nrespondents of an opportunity to invoke 42 U. S. C. §2000e–12(b) as a\nshield to liability. Section 2000e–12(b) provides:\n“In any action or proceeding based on any alleged unlawful employment\npractice, no person shall be subject to any liability or punishment for or\non account of (1) the commission by such person of an unlawful em\nployment practice if he pleads and proves that the act or omission\ncomplained of was in good faith, in conformity with, and in reliance on\nany written interpretation or opinion of the [EEOC] . . . . Such a\ndefense, if established, shall be a bar to the action or proceeding,\nnotwithstanding that (A) after such act or omission, such interpretation\nor opinion is modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial author\nity to be invalid or of no legal effect . . . .”\nSpecifically, given the chance, respondents might have called attention\nto the EEOC guidelines set out in 29 CFR §§1608.3 and 1608.4 (2008).\nThe guidelines recognize that employers may “take affirmative action\nbased on an analysis which reveals facts constituting actual or poten\ntial adverse impact.” §1608.3(a). If “affirmative action” is in order, so\nis the lesser step of discarding a dubious selection device.\n\f26                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   Applying what I view as the proper standard to the\nrecord thus far made, I would hold that New Haven had\nample cause to believe its selection process was flawed and\nnot justified by business necessity. Judged by that stan\ndard, petitioners have not shown that New Haven’s failure\nto certify the exam results violated Title VII’s disparate\ntreatment provision.10\n   The City, all agree, “was faced with a prima facie case of\ndisparate-impact liability,” ante, at 27: The pass rate for\nminority candidates was half the rate for nonminority\ncandidates, and virtually no minority candidates would\nhave been eligible for promotion had the exam results\nbeen certified. Alerted to this stark disparity, the CSB\nheard expert and lay testimony, presented at public hear\nings, in an endeavor to ascertain whether the exams were\nfair and consistent with business necessity. Its investiga\ntion revealed grave cause for concern about the exam\nprocess itself and the City’s failure to consider alternative\nselection devices.\n   Chief among the City’s problems was the very nature of\nthe tests for promotion. In choosing to use written and\noral exams with a 60/40 weighting, the City simply ad\nhered to the union’s preference and apparently gave no\nconsideration to whether the weighting was likely to\nidentify the most qualified fire-officer candidates.11 There\n——————\n   10 The lower courts focused on respondents’ “intent” rather than on\n\nwhether respondents in fact had good cause to act. See 554 F. Supp. 2d\n142, 157 (Conn. 2006). Ordinarily, a remand for fresh consideration\nwould be in order. But the Court has seen fit to preclude further\nproceedings. I therefore explain why, if final adjudication by this Court\nis indeed appropriate, New Haven should be the prevailing party.\n   11 This alone would have posed a substantial problem for New Haven\n\nin a disparate-impact suit, particularly in light of the disparate results\nthe City’s scheme had produced in the past. See supra, at 7. Under the\n\f                      Cite as: 557 U.

Successful fire\nofficers, the City’s description of the position makes clear,\nmust have the “[a]bility to lead personnel effectively,\nmaintain discipline, promote harmony, exercise sound\njudgment, and cooperate with other officials.” CA2 App.\nA432. These qualities are not well measured by written\ntests. Testifying before the CSB, Christopher Hornick, an\nexam-design expert with more than two decades of rele\nvant experience, was emphatic on this point: Leadership\nskills, command presence, and the like “could have been\nidentified and evaluated in a much more appropriate\nway.” Id., at A1042–A1043.\n   Hornick’s commonsense observation is mirrored in case\nlaw and in Title VII’s administrative guidelines. Courts\nhave long criticized written firefighter promotion exams\nfor being “more probative of the test-taker’s ability to\nrecall what a particular text stated on a given topic than\nof his firefighting or supervisory knowledge and abilities.”\n——————\nUniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (Uniform\nGuidelines), employers must conduct “an investigation of suitable\nalternative selection procedures.” 29 CFR §1607.3(B). See also Officers\nfor Justice v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 979 F. 2d 721, 728 (CA9 1992) (“be\nfore utilizing a procedure that has an adverse impact on minorities, the\nCity has an obligation pursuant to the Uniform Guidelines to explore\nalternative procedures and to implement them if they have less adverse\nimpact and are substantially equally valid”). It is no answer to “pre\nsume” that the two-decades-old 60/40 formula was adopted for a “ra\ntional reason” because it “was the result of a union-negotiated collective\nbargaining agreement.” Cf. ante, at 30. That the parties may have\nbeen “rational” says nothing about whether their agreed-upon selection\nprocess was consistent with business necessity. It is not at all unusual\nfor agreements negotiated between employers and unions to run afoul\nof Title VII. See, e.g., Peters v. Missouri-Pacific R. Co., 483 F. 2d 490,\n497 (CA5 1973) (an employment practice “is not shielded [from the\nrequirements of Title VII] by the facts that it is the product of collective\nbargaining and meets the standards of fair representation”).\n\f28                       RICCI v.

A fire officer’s job, courts\nhave observed, “involves complex behaviors, good inter\npersonal skills, the ability to make decisions under tre\nmendous pressure, and a host of other abilities—none of\nwhich is easily measured by a written, multiple choice\ntest.” Firefighters Inst. for Racial Equality v.

Although compre\nhensive statistics are scarce, a 1996 study found that\nnearly two-thirds of surveyed municipalities used assess\nment centers (“simulations of the real world of work”) as\npart of their promotion processes. P. Lowry, A Survey of\nthe Assessment Center Process in the Public Sector, 25\nPublic Personnel Management 307, 315 (1996). That\nfigure represented a marked increase over the previous\ndecade, see ibid., so the percentage today may well be even\nhigher. Among municipalities still relying in part on\nwritten exams, the median weight assigned to them was\n30 percent—half the weight given to New Haven’s written\nexam. Id., at 309.\n   Testimony before the CSB indicated that these alterna\ntive methods were both more reliable and notably less\ndiscriminatory in operation. According to Donald Day of\nthe International Association of Black Professional Fire\nfighters, nearby Bridgeport saw less skewed results after\nswitching to a selection process that placed primary\nweight on an oral exam. CA2 App. A830–A832; see supra,\nat 7–8. And Hornick described assessment centers as\n“demonstrat[ing] dramatically less adverse impacts” than\nwritten exams. CA2 App. A1040.14 Considering the\nprevalence of these proven alternatives, New Haven was\npoorly positioned to argue that promotions based on its\noutmoded and exclusionary selection process qualified as a\nbusiness necessity.

The Court’s specific argu\nments are unavailing.       First, the Court suggests, changing the\noral/written weighting may have violated Title VII’s prohibition on\naltering test scores. Ante, at 31. No one is arguing, however, that the\nresults of the exams given should have been altered. Rather, the\nargument is that the City could have availed itself of a better option\nwhen it initially decided what selection process to use. Second, with\nrespect to assessment centers, the Court identifies “statements to the\nCSB indicat[ing] that the Department could not have used [them] for\nthe 2003 examinations.” Ante, at 31–32. The Court comes up with only\na single statement on this subject—an offhand remark made by peti\ntioner Ricci, who hardly qualifies as an expert in testing methods. See\nante, at 14.

Under the City’s ground rules,\nIOS was not allowed to show the exams to anyone in the\nNew Haven Fire Department prior to their administra\ntion. This “precluded [IOS] from being able to engage in\n[its] normal subject matter expert review process”—\nsomething Legel described as “very critical.” CA2 App.\nA477, A506.

The record does not\nsubstantiate this assertion.

A\ndifference of one or two points on a multiple-choice exam should not be\ndecisive of an applicant’s promotion chances if that difference bears\nlittle relationship to the applicant’s qualifications for the job. Relat\nedly, it appears that the line between a passing and failing score did\nnot accurately differentiate between qualified and unqualified candi\ndates. A number of fire-officer promotional exams have been invali\ndated on these bases. See, e.g., Guardians Assn., 630 F. 2d, at 105\n(“When a cutoff score unrelated to job performance produces disparate\nracial results, Title VII is violated.”); Vulcan Pioneers, Inc. v. New\nJersey Dept. of Civil Serv., 625 F. Supp. 527, 538 (NJ 1985) (“[T]he tests\nhere at issue are not appropriate for ranking candidates.”).\n\f                      Cite as: 557 U.

A reasonable jury, he maintains, could\nhave found that respondents were not actually motivated\nby concern about disparate-impact litigation, but instead\nsought only “to placate a politically important [African-\nAmerican] constituency.” Ante, at 3. As earlier noted, I\nwould not oppose a remand for further proceedings fair to\nboth sides. See supra, at 26, n. 10. It is the Court that\nhas chosen to short-circuit this litigation based on its\npretension that the City has shown, and can show, noth\ning more than a statistical disparity. See supra, at 24,\nn. 8, 25. JUSTICE ALITO compounds the Court’s error.\n  Offering a truncated synopsis of the many hours of\ndeliberations undertaken by the CSB, JUSTICE ALITO finds\nevidence suggesting that respondents’ stated desire to\ncomply with Title VII was insincere, a mere “pretext” for\ndiscrimination against white firefighters. Ante, at 2–3. In\nsupport of his assertion, JUSTICE ALITO recounts at length\nthe alleged machinations of Rev. Boise Kimber (a local\npolitical activist), Mayor John DeStefano, and certain\nmembers of the mayor’s staff. See ante, at 3–10.\n  Most of the allegations JUSTICE ALITO repeats are\ndrawn from petitioners’ statement of facts they deem\nundisputed, a statement displaying an adversarial zeal\nnot uncommonly found in such presentations.17 What\n——————\n  17 Some  of petitioners’ so-called facts find little support in the record,\nand many others can scarcely be deemed material. Petitioners allege,\nfor example, that City officials prevented New Haven’s fire chief and\nassistant chief from sharing their views about the exams with the CSB.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 228a. None of the materials\npetitioners cite, however, “suggests” that this proposition is accurate.\nCf. ante, at 5. In her deposition testimony, City official Karen Dubois-\nWalton specifically denied that she or her colleagues directed the chief\n\f34                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncannot credibly be denied, however, is that the decision\nagainst certification of the exams was made neither by\nKimber nor by the mayor and his staff. The relevant\ndecision was made by the CSB, an unelected, politically\ninsulated body. It is striking that JUSTICE ALITO’s concur\nrence says hardly a word about the CSB itself, perhaps\nbecause there is scant evidence that its motivation was\nanything other than to comply with Title VII’s disparate\nimpact provision. Notably, petitioners did not even seek to\ntake depositions of the two commissioners who voted\nagainst certification. Both submitted uncontested affida\nvits declaring unequivocally that their votes were “based\nsolely on [their] good faith belief that certification” would\nhave discriminated against minority candidates in viola\ntion of federal law. CA2 App. A1605, A1611.\n   JUSTICE ALITO discounts these sworn statements, sug\ngesting that the CSB’s deliberations were tainted by the\npreferences of Kimber and City officials, whether or not\nthe CSB itself was aware of the taint. Kimber and City\nofficials, JUSTICE ALITO speculates, decided early on to\noppose certification and then “engineered” a skewed pres\nentation to the CSB to achieve their preferred outcome.\nAnte, at 12.\n—————— \n\nand assistant chief not to appear. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, \n\np. 850a. Moreover, contrary to the insinuations of petitioners and\nJUSTICE ALITO, the statements made by City officials before the CSB did\nnot emphasize allegations of cheating by test takers. Cf. ante, at 7–8.\nIn her deposition, Dubois-Walton acknowledged sharing the cheating\nallegations not with the CSB, but with a different City commission.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 837a. JUSTICE ALITO also\nreports that the City’s attorney advised the mayor’s team that the way\nto convince the CSB not to certify was “to focus on something other\nthan ‘a big discussion re: adverse impact’ law.” Ante, at 8 (quoting App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 458a). This is a misleading abbre\nviation of the attorney’s advice. Focusing on the exams’ defects and on\ndisparate-impact law is precisely what he recommended. See id., at\n458a–459a.\n\f                    Cite as: 557 U.

The CSB, the record reveals,\ndesigned and conducted an inclusive decisionmaking\nprocess, in which it heard from numerous individuals on\nboth sides of the certification question. See, e.g., CA2 App.\nA1090. Kimber and others no doubt used strong words to\nurge the CSB not to certify the exam results, but the CSB\nreceived “pressure” from supporters of certification as well\nas opponents. Cf. ante, at 6. Petitioners, for example,\nengaged counsel to speak on their behalf before the CSB.\nTheir counsel did not mince words: “[I]f you discard these\nresults,” she warned, “you will get sued. You will force the\ntaxpayers of the city of New Haven into protracted litiga\ntion.” CA2 App. A816. See also id., at A788.\n   The local firefighters union—an organization required\nby law to represent all the City’s firefighters—was simi\nlarly outspoken in favor of certification. Discarding the\ntest results, the union’s president told the CSB, would be\n“totally ridiculous.” Id., at A806. He insisted, inaccu\nrately, that the City was not at risk of disparate-impact\nliability because the exams were administered pursuant to\n“a collective bargaining agreement.” Id., at A1137. Cf.\nsupra, at 26–27, n. 11. Never mentioned by JUSTICE\nALITO in his attempt to show testing expert Christopher\nHornick’s alliance with the City, ante, at 8–9, the CSB\nsolicited Hornick’s testimony at the union’s suggestion, not\nthe City’s. CA2 App. A1128. Hornick’s cogent testimony\nraised substantial doubts about the exams’ reliability. See\nsupra, at 8–10.18\n——————\n  18 City officials, JUSTICE ALITO reports, sent Hornick newspaper ac\n\ncounts and other material about the exams prior to his testimony.\nAnte, at 8. Some of these materials, JUSTICE ALITO intimates, may have\ngiven Hornick an inaccurate portrait of the exams. But Hornick’s\ntestimony before the CSB, viewed in full, indicates that Hornick had an\naccurate understanding of the exam process. Much of Hornick’s analy\nsis focused on the 60/40 weighting of the written and oral exams,\n\f36                      RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  There is scant cause to suspect that maneuvering or\noverheated rhetoric, from either side, prevented the CSB\nfrom evenhandedly assessing the reliability of the exams\nand rendering an independent, good-faith decision on\ncertification. JUSTICE ALITO acknowledges that the CSB\nhad little patience for Kimber’s antics. Ante, at 6–7.19 As\nto petitioners, Chairman Segaloff—who voted to certify\nthe exam results—dismissed the threats made by their\ncounsel as unhelpful and needlessly “inflammatory.” CA2\nApp. A821. Regarding the views expressed by City offi\ncials, the CSB made clear that they were entitled to no\nspecial weight. Id., at A1080.20\n  In any event, JUSTICE ALITO’s analysis contains a more\nfundamental flaw: It equates political considerations with\nunlawful discrimination. As JUSTICE ALITO sees it, if the\nmayor and his staff were motivated by their desire “to\nplacate a . . . racial constituency,” ante, at 3, then they\nengaged in unlawful discrimination against petitioners.\nBut JUSTICE ALITO fails to ask a vital question: “[P]lacate”\nhow? That political officials would have politics in mind is\nhardly extraordinary, and there are many ways in which a\npolitician can attempt to win over a constituency—\n——————\nsomething that neither the Court nor the concurrences even attempt to\ndefend. It is, moreover, entirely misleading to say that the City later\nhired union-proposed Hornick as a “rewar[d]” for his testimony. Cf.\nAnte, at 9.\n   19 To be clear, the Board of Fire Commissioners on which Kimber\n\nserved is an entity separate from the CSB. Kimber was not a member\nof the CSB. Kimber, JUSTICE ALITO states, requested a private meeting\nwith the CSB. Ante, at 6. There is not a shred of evidence that a\nprivate meeting with Kimber or anyone else took place.\n   20 JUSTICE ALITO points to evidence that the mayor had decided not to\n\nmake promotions based on the exams even if the CSB voted to certify\nthe results, going so far as to prepare a press release to that effect.\nAnte, at 9. If anything, this evidence reinforces the conclusion that the\nCSB—which made the noncertification decision—remained independ\nent and above the political fray. The mayor and his staff needed a\ncontingency plan precisely because they did not control the CSB.\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            37\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nincluding a racial constituency—without engaging in\nunlawful discrimination.       As courts have recognized,\n“[p]oliticians routinely respond to bad press . . . , but it is\nnot a violation of Title VII to take advantage of a situation\nto gain political favor.” Henry v. Jones, 507 F. 3d 558, 567\n(CA7 2007).\n   The real issue, then, is not whether the mayor and his\nstaff were politically motivated; it is whether their at\ntempt to score political points was legitimate (i.e., nondis\ncriminatory). Were they seeking to exclude white fire\nfighters from promotion (unlikely, as a fair test would\nundoubtedly result in the addition of white firefighters to\nthe officer ranks), or did they realize, at least belatedly,\nthat their tests could be toppled in a disparate-impact\nsuit? In the latter case, there is no disparate-treatment\nviolation. JUSTICE ALITO, I recognize, would disagree. In\nhis view, an employer’s action to avoid Title VII disparate\nimpact liability qualifies as a presumptively improper\nrace-based employment decision. See ante, at 2. I reject\nthat construction of Title VII. See supra, at 18–20. As I\nsee it, when employers endeavor to avoid exposure to\ndisparate-impact liability, they do not thereby encounter\nliability for disparate treatment.\n   Applying this understanding of Title VII, supported by\nGriggs and the long line of decisions following Griggs, see\nsupra, at 16–17, and nn. 3–4, the District Court found no\ngenuine dispute of material fact. That court noted, par\nticularly, the guidance furnished by Second Circuit prece\ndent. See supra, at 12. Petitioners’ allegations that City\nofficials took account of politics, the District Court deter\nmined, simply “d[id] not suffice” to create an inference of\nunlawful discrimination. 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 160, n. 12.\nThe noncertification decision, even if undertaken “in a\npolitical context,” reflected a legitimate “intent not to\nimplement a promotional process based on testing results\nthat had an adverse impact.” Id., at 158, 160. Indeed, the\n\f38                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court perceived “a total absence of any evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus towards [petitioners].” Id., at 158.\nSee also id., at 162 (“Nothing in the record in this case\nsuggests that the City defendants or CSB acted ‘because\nof’ discriminatory animus toward [petitioners] or other\nnon-minority applicants for promotion.”). Perhaps the\nDistrict Court could have been more expansive in its\ndiscussion of these issues, but its conclusions appear\nentirely consistent with the record before it.21\n   It is indeed regrettable that the City’s noncertification\ndecision would have required all candidates to go through\nanother selection process. But it would have been more\nregrettable to rely on flawed exams to shut out candidates\nwho may well have the command presence and other\nqualities needed to excel as fire officers. Yet that is the\nchoice the Court makes today. It is a choice that breaks\nthe promise of Griggs that groups long denied equal oppor\ntunity would not be held back by tests “fair in form, but\ndiscriminatory in operation.” 401 U. S., at 431.\n——————\n   21 The District Court, JUSTICE ALITO writes, “all but conceded that a\n\njury could find that the City’s asserted justification was pretextual” by\n“admitt[ing] that ‘a jury could rationally infer that city officials worked\nbehind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because\nthey knew that, were the exams certified, the Mayor would incur the\nwrath of [Rev. Boise] Kimber and other influential leaders of New\nHaven’s African-American community.’ ” Ante, at 3, 13 (quoting 554 F.\nSupp. 2d, at 162). The District Court drew the quoted passage from\npetitioners’ lower court brief, and used it in reference to a First Amend\nment claim not before this Court. In any event, it is not apparent why\nthese alleged political maneuvers suggest an intent to discriminate\nagainst petitioners. That City officials may have wanted to please\npolitical supporters is entirely consistent with their stated desire to\navoid a disparate-impact violation. Cf. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 18) (allegations that senior Government officials\ncondoned the arrest and detention of thousands of Arab Muslim men\nfollowing the September 11 attacks failed to establish even a “plausible\ninference” of unlawful discrimination sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss).\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

(City), uses objective examinations to identify those\n firefighters best qualified for promotion. When the results of such an\n exam to fill vacant lieutenant and captain positions showed that\n white candidates had outperformed minority candidates, a rancorous\n public debate ensued. Confronted with arguments both for and\n against certifying the test results—and threats of a lawsuit either\n way—the City threw out the results based on the statistical racial\n disparity. Petitioners, white and Hispanic firefighters who passed\n the exams but were denied a chance at promotions by the City’s re\n fusal to certify the test results, sued the City and respondent officials,\n alleging that discarding the test results discriminated against them\n based on their race in violation of, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil\n Rights Act of 1964. The defendants responded that had they certified\n the test results, they could have faced Title VII liability for adopting\n a practice having a disparate impact on minority firefighters. The\n District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and\n the Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The City’s action in discarding the tests violated Title VII.\n  Pp. 16–34.\n     (a) Title VII prohibits intentional acts of employment discrimina\n  tion based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n  §2000e–2(a)(1) (disparate treatment), as well as policies or practices\n  that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a dispropor\n  tionately adverse effect on minorities, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) (disparate\n  impact).

If the employer meets that\n    burden, the plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer\n    refuses to adopt an available alternative practice that has less dispa\n    rate impact and serves the employer’s legitimate needs. §§2000e–\n    2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C). Pp. 17–19.\n       (b) Under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional\n    discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an\n    unintentional, disparate impact, the employer must have a strong\n    basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact li\n    ability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.\n    The Court’s analysis begins with the premise that the City’s actions\n    would violate Title VII’s disparate-treatment prohibition absent some\n    valid defense. All the evidence demonstrates that the City rejected\n    the test results because the higher scoring candidates were white.\n    Without some other justification, this express, race-based decision\n    making is prohibited. The question, therefore, is whether the pur\n    pose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\n    be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. The Court has\n    considered cases similar to the present litigation, but in the context\n    of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Such cases\n    can provide helpful guidance in this statutory context.

In those cases, the\n    Court held that certain government actions to remedy past racial dis\n    crimination—actions that are themselves based on race—are consti\n    tutional only where there is a “strong basis in evidence” that the re\n    medial actions were necessary.

In announcing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the Wy\n    gant plurality recognized the tension between eliminating segrega\n    tion and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all gov\n    ernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other. 476\n    U.

The same interests are at work in the interplay between Title\n    VII’s disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions. Apply\n    ing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to\n    both provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance\n    with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances.

The problem for respondents\nis that such a prima facie case—essentially, a threshold showing of a\nsignificant statistical disparity, Connecticut v. Teal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110751\"><a href=\"/opinion/110751/connecticut-v-teal/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n446, and nothing more—is far from a strong basis in evidence that\nthe City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the\ntest results. That is because the City could be liable for disparate\nimpact discrimination only if the exams at issue were not job related\nand consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally\nvalid, less discriminatory alternative that served the City’s needs but\nthat the City refused to adopt. §§2000e–2(k)(1)(A), (C). Based on the\nrecord the parties developed through discovery, there is no substan\ntial basis in evidence that the test was deficient in either respect.\nPp. 26–28.\n      (ii) The City’s assertions that the exams at issue were not job re\nlated and consistent with business necessity are blatantly contra\ndicted by the record, which demonstrates the detailed steps taken to\ndevelop and administer the tests and the painstaking analyses of the\nquestions asked to assure their relevance to the captain and lieuten\nant positions. The testimony also shows that complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not specifically ap\nply to firefighting practices in the City were fully addressed, and that\nthe City turned a blind eye to evidence supporting the exams’ valid\nity. Pp. 28–29.\n      (iii) Respondents also lack a strong basis in evidence showing an\nequally valid, less discriminatory testing alternative that the City, by\ncertifying the test results, would necessarily have refused to adopt.\nRespondents’ three arguments to the contrary all fail. First, respon\ndents refer to testimony that a different composite-score calculation\nwould have allowed the City to consider black candidates for then\nopen positions, but they have produced no evidence to show that the\ncandidate weighting actually used was indeed arbitrary, or that the\ndifferent weighting would be an equally valid way to determine\nwhether candidates are qualified for promotions. Second, respon\ndents argue that the City could have adopted a different interpreta\ntion of its charter provision limiting promotions to the highest scoring\n\f4                         RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    applicants, and that the interpretation would have produced less dis\n    criminatory results; but respondents’ approach would have violated\n    Title VII’s prohibition of race-based adjustment of test results,\n    §2000e–2(l). Third, testimony asserting that the use of an assess\n    ment center to evaluate candidates’ behavior in typical job tasks\n    would have had less adverse impact than written exams does not aid\n    respondents, as it is contradicted by other statements in the record\n    indicating that the City could not have used assessment centers for\n    the exams at issue. Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis\n    in-evidence standard applies to this case, respondents cannot create a\n    genuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradictory) state\n    ments in the record. Pp. 29–33.\n         (iv) Fear of litigation alone cannot justify the City’s reliance on\n    race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and\n    qualified for promotions. Discarding the test results was impermis\n    sible under Title VII, and summary judgment is appropriate for peti\n    tioners on their disparate-treatment claim. If, after it certifies the\n    test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of\n    today’s holding the City can avoid disparate-impact liability based on\n    the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, it\n    would have been subject to disparate-treatment liability.

An agency’s officers command respect within the\ndepartment and in the whole community; and, of course,\nadded responsibilities command increased salary and\nbenefits. Aware of the intense competition for promotions,\nNew Haven, like many cities, relies on objective examina\ntions to identify the best qualified candidates.\n   In 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took examinations\nto qualify for promotion to the rank of lieutenant or cap\ntain. Promotion examinations in New Haven (or City)\nwere infrequent, so the stakes were high. The results\nwould determine which firefighters would be considered\nfor promotions during the next two years, and the order in\nwhich they would be considered. Many firefighters stud\n\f2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nied for months, at considerable personal and financial cost.\n  When the examination results showed that white candi\ndates had outperformed minority candidates, the mayor\nand other local politicians opened a public debate that\nturned rancorous. Some firefighters argued the tests\nshould be discarded because the results showed the tests\nto be discriminatory. They threatened a discrimination\nlawsuit if the City made promotions based on the tests.\nOther firefighters said the exams were neutral and fair.\nAnd they, in turn, threatened a discrimination lawsuit if\nthe City, relying on the statistical racial disparity, ignored\nthe test results and denied promotions to the candidates\nwho had performed well. In the end the City took the side\nof those who protested the test results. It threw out the\nexaminations.\n  Certain white and Hispanic firefighters who likely\nwould have been promoted based on their good test per\nformance sued the City and some of its officials. Theirs is\nthe suit now before us. The suit alleges that, by discard\ning the test results, the City and the named officials dis\ncriminated against the plaintiffs based on their race, in\nviolation of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n78 Stat. 253, as amended, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §2000e et seq., and\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend\nment. The City and the officials defended their actions,\narguing that if they had certified the results, they could\nhave faced liability under Title VII for adopting a practice\nthat had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendants, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n  We conclude that race-based action like the City’s in this\ncase is impermissible under Title VII unless the employer\ncan demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that, had it not\ntaken the action, it would have been liable under the\ndisparate-impact statute. The respondents, we further\ndetermine, cannot meet that threshold standard. As a\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

In light of our ruling under the\nstatutes, we need not reach the question whether respon\ndents’ actions may have violated the Equal Protection\nClause.\n                             I\n   This litigation comes to us after the parties’ cross\nmotions for summary judgment, so we set out the facts in\nsome detail. As the District Court noted, although “the\nparties strenuously dispute the relevance and legal import\nof, and inferences to be drawn from, many aspects of this\ncase, the underlying facts are largely undisputed.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

The charter establishes a merit system. That system\nrequires the City to fill vacancies in the classified civil\nservice ranks with the most qualified individuals, as de\ntermined by job-related examinations. After each exami\nnation, the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) certifies\na ranked list of applicants who passed the test. Under the\ncharter’s “rule of three,” the relevant hiring authority\nmust fill each vacancy by choosing one candidate from the\ntop three scorers on the list. Certified promotional lists\nremain valid for two years.\n   The City’s contract with the New Haven firefighters’\nunion specifies additional requirements for the promotion\nprocess. Under the contract, applicants for lieutenant and\ncaptain positions were to be screened using written and\noral examinations, with the written exam accounting for\n60 percent and the oral exam 40 percent of an applicant’s\n\f4                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntotal score. To sit for the examinations, candidates for\nlieutenant needed 30 months’ experience in the Depart\nment, a high-school diploma, and certain vocational train\ning courses. Candidates for captain needed one year’s\nservice as a lieutenant in the Department, a high-school\ndiploma, and certain vocational training courses.\n   After reviewing bids from various consultants, the City\nhired Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc. (IOS) to\ndevelop and administer the examinations, at a cost to the\nCity of $100,000. IOS is an Illinois company that special\nizes in designing entry-level and promotional examina\ntions for fire and police departments. In order to fit the\nexaminations to the New Haven Department, IOS began\nthe test-design process by performing job analyses to\nidentify the tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are\nessential for the lieutenant and captain positions. IOS\nrepresentatives interviewed incumbent captains and\nlieutenants and their supervisors. They rode with and\nobserved other on-duty officers. Using information from\nthose interviews and ride-alongs, IOS wrote job-analysis\nquestionnaires and administered them to most of the\nincumbent battalion chiefs, captains, and lieutenants in\nthe Department. At every stage of the job analyses, IOS,\nby deliberate choice, oversampled minority firefighters to\nensure that the results—which IOS would use to develop\nthe examinations—would not unintentionally favor white\ncandidates.\n   With the job-analysis information in hand, IOS devel\noped the written examinations to measure the candidates’\njob-related knowledge. For each test, IOS compiled a list\nof training manuals, Department procedures, and other\nmaterials to use as sources for the test questions. IOS\npresented the proposed sources to the New Haven fire\nchief and assistant fire chief for their approval. Then,\nusing the approved sources, IOS drafted a multiple-choice\ntest for each position. Each test had 100 questions, as\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired by CSB rules, and was written below a 10th\ngrade reading level. After IOS prepared the tests, the City\nopened a 3-month study period. It gave candidates a list\nthat identified the source material for the questions, in\ncluding the specific chapters from which the questions\nwere taken.\n   IOS developed the oral examinations as well. These\nconcentrated on job skills and abilities. Using the job\nanalysis information, IOS wrote hypothetical situations to\ntest incident-command skills, firefighting tactics, interper\nsonal skills, leadership, and management ability, among\nother things. Candidates would be presented with these\nhypotheticals and asked to respond before a panel of three\nassessors.\n   IOS assembled a pool of 30 assessors who were superior\nin rank to the positions being tested. At the City’s insis\ntence (because of controversy surrounding previous ex\naminations), all the assessors came from outside Connecti\ncut. IOS submitted the assessors’ resumes to City officials\nfor approval. They were battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs,\nand chiefs from departments of similar sizes to New Ha\nven’s throughout the country. Sixty-six percent of the\npanelists were minorities, and each of the nine three\nmember assessment panels contained two minority mem\nbers. IOS trained the panelists for several hours on the\nday before it administered the examinations, teaching\nthem how to score the candidates’ responses consistently\nusing checklists of desired criteria.\n   Candidates took the examinations in November and\nDecember 2003. Seventy-seven candidates completed the\nlieutenant examination—43 whites, 19 blacks, and 15\nHispanics. Of those, 34 candidates passed—25 whites, 6\nblacks, and 3 Hispanics. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Subsequent\nvacancies would have allowed at least 3 black candidates\nto be considered for promotion to lieutenant.\n   Forty-one candidates completed the captain examina\ntion—25 whites, 8 blacks, and 8 Hispanics. Of those, 22\ncandidates passed—16 whites, 3 blacks, and 3 Hispanics.\nIbid. Seven captain positions were vacant at the time of\nthe examination. Under the rule of three, 9 candidates\nwere eligible for an immediate promotion to captain—7\nwhites and 2 Hispanics. Ibid.\n                             B\n   The City’s contract with IOS contemplated that, after\nthe examinations, IOS would prepare a technical report\nthat described the examination processes and methodolo\ngies and analyzed the results. But in January 2004,\nrather than requesting the technical report, City officials,\nincluding the City’s counsel, Thomas Ude, convened a\nmeeting with IOS Vice President Chad Legel. (Legel was\nthe leader of the IOS team that developed and adminis\ntered the tests.) Based on the test results, the City offi\ncials expressed concern that the tests had discriminated\nagainst minority candidates. Legel defended the examina\ntions’ validity, stating that any numerical disparity be\ntween white and minority candidates was likely due to\nvarious external factors and was in line with results of the\nDepartment’s previous promotional examinations.\n   Several days after the meeting, Ude sent a letter to the\nCSB purporting to outline its duties with respect to the\nexamination results. Ude stated that under federal law,\n“a statistical demonstration of disparate impact,” standing\nalone, “constitutes a sufficiently serious claim of racial\ndiscrimination to serve as a predicate for employer\ninitiated, voluntar[y] remedies—even . . . race-conscious\nremedies.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 443a;\nsee also </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Ude”).\n                               1\n   The CSB first met to consider certifying the results on\nJanuary 22, 2004. Tina Burgett, director of the City’s\nDepartment of Human Resources, opened the meeting by\ntelling the CSB that “there is a significant disparate im\npact on these two exams.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–\n1428, at 466a. She distributed lists showing the candi\ndates’ races and scores (written, oral, and composite) but\nnot their names. Ude also described the test results as\nreflecting “a very significant disparate impact,” id., at\n477a, and he outlined possible grounds for the CSB’s\nrefusing to certify the results.\n   Although they did not know whether they had passed or\nfailed, some firefighter-candidates spoke at the first CSB\nmeeting in favor of certifying the test results. Michael\nBlatchley stated that “[e]very one” of the questions on the\nwritten examination “came from the [study] material. . . .\n[I]f you read the materials and you studied the material,\nyou would have done well on the test.” App. in No. 06–\n4996–cv (CA2), pp. A772–A773 (hereinafter CA2 App.).\nFrank Ricci stated that the test questions were based on\nthe Department’s own rules and procedures and on “na\ntionally recognized” materials that represented the “ac\ncepted standard[s]” for firefighting. Id., at A785–A786.\nRicci stated that he had “several learning disabilities,”\nincluding dyslexia; that he had spent more than $1,000 to\npurchase the materials and pay his neighbor to read them\non tape so he could “give it [his] best shot”; and that he\nhad studied “8 to 13 hours a day to prepare” for the test.\nId., at A786, A789. “I don’t even know if I made it,” Ricci\ntold the CSB, “[b]ut the people who passed should be\npromoted. When your life’s on the line, second best may\nnot be good enough.” Id., at A787–A788.\n   Other firefighters spoke against certifying the test\n\f8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresults. They described the test questions as outdated or\nnot relevant to firefighting practices in New Haven. Gary\nTinney stated that source materials “came out of New\nYork. . . . Their makeup of their city and everything is\ntotally different than ours.” Id., at A774–A775; see also\nid., at A779, A780–A781. And they criticized the test\nmaterials, a full set of which cost about $500, for being too\nexpensive and too long.\n                              2\n   At a second CSB meeting, on February 5, the president\nof the New Haven firefighters’ union asked the CSB to\nperform a validation study to determine whether the tests\nwere job-related. Petitioners’ counsel in this action argued\nthat the CSB should certify the results. A representative\nof the International Association of Black Professional\nFirefighters, Donald Day from neighboring Bridgeport,\nConnecticut, “beseech[ed]” the CSB “to throw away that\ntest,” which he described as “inherently unfair” because of\nthe racial distribution of the results. Id., at A830–A831.\nAnother Bridgeport-based representative of the associa\ntion, Ronald Mackey, stated that a validation study was\nnecessary. He suggested that the City could “adjust” the\ntest results to “meet the criteria of having a certain\namount of minorities get elevated to the rank of Lieuten\nant and Captain.” Id., at A838. At the end of this meet\ning, the CSB members agreed to ask IOS to send a repre\nsentative to explain how it had developed and\nadministered the examinations.        They also discussed\nasking a panel of experts to review the examinations and\nadvise the CSB whether to certify the results.\n                             3\n  At a third meeting, on February 11, Legel addressed the\nCSB on behalf of IOS. Legel stated that IOS had previ\nously prepared entry-level firefighter examinations for the\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCity but not a promotional examination. He explained\nthat IOS had developed examinations for departments in\ncommunities with demographics similar to New Haven’s,\nincluding Orange County, Florida; Lansing, Michigan; and\nSan Jose, California.\n   Legel explained the exam-development process to the\nCSB. He began by describing the job analyses IOS per\nformed of the captain and lieutenant positions—the inter\nviews, ride-alongs, and questionnaires IOS designed to\n“generate a list of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities\nthat are considered essential to performance” of the jobs.\nId., at A931–A932. He outlined how IOS prepared the\nwritten and oral examinations, based on the job-analysis\nresults, to test most heavily those qualities that the re\nsults indicated were “critica[l]” or “essentia[l].” Id., at\nA931. And he noted that IOS took the material for each\ntest question directly from the approved source materials.\nLegel told the CSB that third-party reviewers had scruti\nnized the examinations to ensure that the written test was\ndrawn from the source material and that the oral test\naccurately tested real-world situations that captains and\nlieutenants would face. Legel confirmed that IOS had\nselected oral-examination panelists so that each three\nmember assessment panel included one white, one black,\nand one Hispanic member.\n   Near the end of his remarks, Legel “implor[ed] anyone\nthat had . . . concerns to review the content of the exam.\nIn my professional opinion, it’s facially neutral. There’s\nnothing in those examinations . . . that should cause\nsomebody to think that one group would perform differ\nently than another group.” Id., at A961.\n                              4\n  At the next meeting, on March 11, the CSB heard from\nthree witnesses it had selected to “tell us a little bit about\ntheir views of the testing, the process, [and] the methodol\n\f10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nogy.” Id., at A1020. The first, Christopher Hornick, spoke\nto the CSB by telephone.           Hornick is an indus\ntrial/organizational psychologist from Texas who operates\na consulting business that “direct[ly]” competes with IOS.\nId., at A1029. Hornick, who had not “stud[ied] the test at\nlength or in detail” and had not “seen the job analysis\ndata,” told the CSB that the scores indicated a “relatively\nhigh adverse impact.” Id., at A1028, A1030, A1043. He\nstated that “[n]ormally, whites outperform ethnic minori\nties on the majority of standardized testing procedures,”\nbut that he was “a little surprised” by the disparity in the\ncandidates’ scores—although “[s]ome of it is fairly typical\nof what we’ve seen in other areas of the countr[y] and\nother tests.” Id., at A1028–A1029. Hornick stated that\nthe “adverse impact on the written exam was somewhat\nhigher but generally in the range that we’ve seen profes\nsionally.” Id., at A1030–A1031.\n   When asked to explain the New Haven test results,\nHornick opined in the telephone conversation that the\ncollective-bargaining agreement’s requirement of using\nwritten and oral examinations with a 60/40 composite\nscore might account for the statistical disparity. He also\nstated that “[b]y not having anyone from within the\n[D]epartment review” the tests before they were adminis\ntered—a limitation the City had imposed to protect the\nsecurity of the exam questions—“you inevitably get things\nin there” that are based on the source materials but are\nnot relevant to New Haven. Id., at A1034–A1035. Hor\nnick suggested that testing candidates at an “assessment\ncenter” rather than using written and oral examinations\n“might serve [the City’s] needs better.” Id., at A1039–\nA1040. Hornick stated that assessment centers, where\ncandidates face real-world situations and respond just as\nthey would in the field, allow candidates “to demonstrate\nhow they would address a particular problem as opposed\nto just verbally saying it or identifying the correct option\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non a written test.” Ibid.\n   Hornick made clear that he was “not suggesting that\n[IOS] somehow created a test that had adverse impacts\nthat it should not have had.” Id., at A1038. He described\nthe IOS examinations as “reasonably good test[s].” Id., at\nA1041. He stated that the CSB’s best option might be to\n“certify the list as it exists” and work to change the proc\ness for future tests, including by “[r]ewriting the Civil\nService Rules.” Ibid. Hornick concluded his telephonic\nremarks by telling the CSB that “for the future,” his com\npany “certainly would like to help you if we can.” Id., at\nA1046.\n   The second witness was Vincent Lewis, a fire program\nspecialist for the Department of Homeland Security and a\nretired fire captain from Michigan. Lewis, who is black,\nhad looked “extensively” at the lieutenant exam and “a\nlittle less extensively” at the captain exam. He stated that\nthe candidates “should know that material.” Id., at\nA1048, A1052. In Lewis’s view, the “questions were rele\nvant for both exams,” and the New Haven candidates had\nan advantage because the study materials identified the\nparticular book chapters from which the questions were\ntaken. In other departments, by contrast, “you had to\nknow basically the . . . entire book.” Id., at A1053. Lewis\nconcluded that any disparate impact likely was due to a\npattern that “usually whites outperform some of the mi\nnorities on testing,” or that “more whites . . . take the\nexam.” Id., at A1054.\n   The final witness was Janet Helms, a professor at Bos\nton College whose “primary area of expertise” is “not with\nfirefighters per se” but in “race and culture as they influ\nence performance on tests and other assessment proce\ndures.” Id., at A1060. Helms expressly declined the CSB’s\noffer to review the examinations. At the outset, she noted\nthat “regardless of what kind of written test we give in\nthis country . . . we can just about predict how many peo\n\f12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nple will pass who are members of under-represented\ngroups. And your data are not that inconsistent with\nwhat predictions would say were the case.” Id., at A1061.\nHelms nevertheless offered several “ideas about what\nmight be possible factors” to explain statistical differences\nin the results. Id., at A1062. She concluded that because\n67 percent of the respondents to the job-analysis question\nnaires were white, the test questions might have favored\nwhite candidates, because “most of the literature on fire\nfighters shows that the different groups perform the job\ndifferently.” Id., at A1063. Helms closed by stating that\nno matter what test the City had administered, it would\nhave revealed “a disparity between blacks and whites,\nHispanics and whites,” particularly on a written test. Id.,\nat A1072.\n                              5\n  At the final CSB meeting, on March 18, Ude (the City’s\ncounsel) argued against certifying the examination re\nsults. Discussing the City’s obligations under federal law,\nUde advised the CSB that a finding of adverse impact “is\nthe beginning, not the end, of a review of testing proce\ndures” to determine whether they violated the disparate\nimpact provision of Title VII. Ude focused the CSB on\ndetermining “whether there are other ways to test for . . .\nthose positions that are equally valid with less adverse\nimpact.” Id., at A1101. Ude described Hornick as having\nsaid that the written examination “had one of the most\nsevere adverse impacts that he had seen” and that “there\nare much better alternatives to identifying [firefighting]\nskills.” Ibid.

DuBois-Walton\nstated that the results, when considered under the rule of\nthree and applied to then-existing captain and lieutenant\nvacancies, created a situation in which black and Hispanic\ncandidates were disproportionately excluded from oppor\ntunity. DuBois-Walton also relied on Hornick’s testimony,\nasserting that Hornick “made it extremely clear that . . .\nthere are more appropriate ways to assess one’s ability to\nserve” as a captain or lieutenant.

She, too, relied on\nHornick’s statement to show the existence of alternative\ntesting methods, describing Hornick as having “started to\npoint out that alternative testing does exist” and as having\n“begun to suggest that there are some different ways of\ndoing written examinations.” Id., at A1125, A1128.\n   Other witnesses addressed the CSB. They included the\npresident of the New Haven firefighters’ union, who sup\nported certification. He reminded the CSB that Hornick\n“also concluded that the tests were reasonable and fair\nand under the current structure to certify them.” Id., at\nA1137. Firefighter Frank Ricci again argued for certifica\ntion; he stated that although “assessment centers in some\ncases show less adverse impact,” id., at A1140, they were\nnot available alternatives for the current round of promo\ntions. It would take several years, Ricci explained, for the\nDepartment to develop an assessment-center protocol and\nthe accompanying training materials. Id., at A1141.\nLieutenant Matthew Marcarelli, who had taken the cap\ntain’s exam, spoke in favor of certification.\n   At the close of witness testimony, the CSB voted on a\nmotion to certify the examinations. With one member\nrecused, the CSB deadlocked 2 to 2, resulting in a decision\nnot to certify the results. Explaining his vote to certify the\nresults, Chairman Segaloff stated that “nobody convinced\nme that we can feel comfortable that, in fact, there’s some\nlikelihood that there’s going to be an exam designed that’s\ngoing to be less discriminatory.” Id., at A1159–A1160.\n                             C\n   The CSB’s decision not to certify the examination re\nsults led to this lawsuit.

Petitioners also filed timely charges\nof discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC); upon the EEOC’s issuing right\nto-sue letters, petitioners amended their complaint to\nassert that the City violated the disparate-treatment\nprohibition contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, as amended.

It described petition\ners’ argument as “boil[ing] down to the assertion that if\n[respondents] cannot prove that the disparities on the\nLieutenant and Captain exams were due to a particular\nflaw inherent in those exams, then they should have\ncertified the results because there was no other alterna\n\f16                  RICCI v.

It also ruled that respondents’\n“motivation to avoid making promotions based on a test\nwith a racially disparate impact . . . does not, as a matter\nof law, constitute discriminatory intent” under Title VII.\nId., at 160. The District Court rejected petitioners’ equal\nprotection claim on the theory that respondents had not\nacted because of “discriminatory animus” toward petition\ners. Id., at 162. It concluded that respondents’ actions\nwere not “based on race” because “all applicants took the\nsame test, and the result was the same for all because the\ntest results were discarded and nobody was promoted.”\nId., at 161.\n   After full briefing and argument by the parties, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed in a one-paragraph, unpub\nlished summary order; it later withdrew that order, issu\ning in its place a nearly identical, one-paragraph per\ncuriam opinion adopting the District Court’s reasoning.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (CA2 2008).

The\nGriggs Court stated that the “touchstone” for disparate\nimpact liability is the lack of “business necessity”: “If an\nemployment practice which operates to exclude [minori\nties] cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the\npractice is prohibited.” Ibid.; see also id., at 432 (em\nployer’s burden to demonstrate that practice has “a mani\nfest relationship to the employment in question”); Albe\nmarle Paper Co. v.

The Act included a provision\ncodifying the prohibition on disparate-impact discrimina\ntion. That provision is now in force along with the dispa\nrate-treatment section already noted. Under the dispa\nrate-impact statute, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie\nviolation by showing that an employer uses “a particular\nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i).

S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness necessity.” Ibid. Even if the employer meets\nthat burden, however, a plaintiff may still succeed by\nshowing that the employer refuses to adopt an available\nalternative employment practice that has less disparate\nimpact and serves the employer’s legitimate needs.\n§§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).\n                              B\n   Petitioners allege that when the CSB refused to certify\nthe captain and lieutenant exam results based on the race\nof the successful candidates, it discriminated against them\nin violation of Title VII’s disparate-treatment provision.\nThe City counters that its decision was permissible be\ncause the tests “appear[ed] to violate Title VII’s disparate\nimpact provisions.” Brief for Respondents 12.\n   Our analysis begins with this premise: The City’s ac\ntions would violate the disparate-treatment prohibition of\nTitle VII absent some valid defense. All the evidence\ndemonstrates that the City chose not to certify the exami\nnation results because of the statistical disparity based on\nrace—i.e., how minority candidates had performed when\ncompared to white candidates. As the District Court put\nit, the City rejected the test results because “too many\nwhites and not enough minorities would be promoted were\nthe lists to be certified.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 152; see also\nibid. (respondents’ “own arguments . . . show that the\nCity’s reasons for advocating non-certification were re\nlated to the racial distribution of the results”). Without\nsome other justification, this express, race-based deci\nsionmaking violates Title VII’s command that employers\ncannot take adverse employment actions because of an\nindividual’s race. See §2000e–2(a)(1).\n   The District Court did not adhere to this principle,\nhowever. It held that respondents’ “motivation to avoid\nmaking promotions based on a test with a racially dispa\nrate impact . . . does not, as a matter of law, constitute\n\f20                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscriminatory intent.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 160. And the\nGovernment makes a similar argument in this Court. It\ncontends that the “structure of Title VII belies any claim\nthat an employer’s intent to comply with Title VII’s dispa\nrate-impact provisions constitutes prohibited discrimina\ntion on the basis of race.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11. But both of those statements turn\nupon the City’s objective—avoiding disparate-impact\nliability—while ignoring the City’s conduct in the name of\nreaching that objective. Whatever the City’s ultimate\naim—however well intentioned or benevolent it might\nhave seemed—the City made its employment decision\nbecause of race. The City rejected the test results solely\nbecause the higher scoring candidates were white. The\nquestion is not whether that conduct was discriminatory\nbut whether the City had a lawful justification for its race\nbased action.\n   We consider, therefore, whether the purpose to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\nbe prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. Courts\noften confront cases in which statutes and principles point\nin different directions. Our task is to provide guidance to\nemployers and courts for situations when these two prohi\nbitions could be in conflict absent a rule to reconcile them.\nIn providing this guidance our decision must be consistent\nwith the important purpose of Title VII—that the work\nplace be an environment free of discrimination, where race\nis not a barrier to opportunity.\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the parties’\nproposed means of reconciling the statutory provisions.\nPetitioners take a strict approach, arguing that under\nTitle VII, it cannot be permissible for an employer to take\nrace-based adverse employment actions in order to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability—even if the employer knows its\npractice violates the disparate-impact provision. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 43. Petitioners would have us hold that,\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder Title VII, avoiding unintentional discrimination\ncannot justify intentional discrimination. That assertion,\nhowever, ignores the fact that, by codifying the disparate\nimpact provision in 1991, Congress has expressly prohib\nited both types of discrimination. We must interpret the\nstatute to give effect to both provisions where possible.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Atlantic Research Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145719\"><a href=\"/opinion/145719/united-states-v-atlantic-research-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 137 (2007) (rejecting an interpretation\nthat would render a statutory provision “a dead letter”).\nWe cannot accept petitioners’ broad and inflexible\nformulation.\n   Petitioners next suggest that an employer in fact must\nbe in violation of the disparate-impact provision before it\ncan use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment\nsuit. Again, this is overly simplistic and too restrictive of\nTitle VII’s purpose. The rule petitioners offer would run\ncounter to what we have recognized as Congress’s intent\nthat “voluntary compliance” be “the preferred means of\nachieving the objectives of Title VII.” Firefighters v. Cleve\nland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111748\"><a href=\"/opinion/111748/firefighters-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515 (1986); see also Wygant v.

Forbid\nding employers to act unless they know, with certainty,\nthat a practice violates the disparate-impact provision\nwould bring compliance efforts to a near standstill. Even\nin the limited situations when this restricted standard\ncould be met, employers likely would hesitate before tak\ning voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in\nthe course of litigation and then held to account for dispa\nrate treatment.\n   At the opposite end of the spectrum, respondents and\nthe Government assert that an employer’s good-faith belief\nthat its actions are necessary to comply with Title VII’s\ndisparate-impact provision should be enough to justify\nrace-conscious conduct. But the original, foundational\nprohibition of Title VII bars employers from taking ad\n\f22                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nverse action “because of . . . race.” §2000e–2(a)(1). And\nwhen Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in\n1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability\nfor actions taken in a good-faith effort to comply with the\nnew, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k). Allow\ning employers to violate the disparate-treatment prohibi\ntion based on a mere good-faith fear of disparate-impact\nliability would encourage race-based action at the slightest\nhint of disparate impact. A minimal standard could cause\nemployers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial\npromotional examinations even where there is little if any\nevidence of disparate-impact discrimination. That would\namount to a de facto quota system, in which a “focus on\nstatistics . . . could put undue pressure on employers to\nadopt inappropriate prophylactic measures.” Watson, 487\nU. S., at 992 (plurality opinion). Even worse, an employer\ncould discard test results (or other employment practices)\nwith the intent of obtaining the employer’s preferred racial\nbalance. That operational principle could not be justified,\nfor Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of\nits requirements as calling for outright racial balancing.\n§2000e–2(j). The purpose of Title VII “is to promote hiring\non the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis\nof race or color.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at 434.\n    In searching for a standard that strikes a more appro\npriate balance, we note that this Court has considered\ncases similar to this one, albeit in the context of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The\nCourt has held that certain government actions to remedy\npast racial discrimination—actions that are themselves\nbased on race—are constitutional only where there is a\n“ ‘strong basis in evidence’ ” that the remedial actions were\nnecessary.

S. ____ (2009)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall respects to those under the Constitution. That does not\nmean the constitutional authorities are irrelevant, how\never. Our cases discussing constitutional principles can\nprovide helpful guidance in this statutory context. See\nWatson, supra, at 993 (plurality opinion).\n   Writing for a plurality in Wygant and announcing the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard, Justice Powell recog\nnized the tension between eliminating segregation and\ndiscrimination on the one hand and doing away with all\ngovernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on\nthe other. 476 U. S., at 277. The plurality stated that\nthose “related constitutional duties are not always harmo\nnious,” and that “reconciling them requires . . . employers\nto act with extraordinary care.” Ibid. The plurality re\nquired a strong basis in evidence because “[e]videntiary\nsupport for the conclusion that remedial action is war\nranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is\nchallenged in court by nonminority employees.” Ibid. The\nCourt applied the same standard in Croson, observing that\n“an amorphous claim that there has been past discrimina\ntion . . . cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial\nquota.” 488 U. S., at 499.\n   The same interests are at work in the interplay between\nthe disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions\nof Title VII. Congress has imposed liability on employers\nfor unintentional discrimination in order to rid the work\nplace of “practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory\nin operation.” Griggs, supra, at 431. But it has also pro\nhibited employers from taking adverse employment ac\ntions “because of” race. §2000e–2(a)(1). Applying the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect\nto both the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact\nprovisions, allowing violations of one in the name of com\npliance with the other only in certain, narrow circum\nstances. The standard leaves ample room for employers’\nvoluntary compliance efforts, which are essential to the\n\f24                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatutory scheme and to Congress’s efforts to eradicate\nworkplace discrimination. See Firefighters, supra, at 515.\nAnd the standard appropriately constrains employers’\ndiscretion in making race-based decisions: It limits that\ndiscretion to cases in which there is a strong basis in\nevidence of disparate-impact liability, but it is not so\nrestrictive that it allows employers to act only when there\nis a provable, actual violation.\n   Resolving the statutory conflict in this way allows the\ndisparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is\nconsistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the\nprohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores\non the basis of race. See §2000e–2(l). Examinations like\nthose administered by the City create legitimate expecta\ntions on the part of those who took the tests. As is the\ncase with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters\nhere invested substantial time, money, and personal\ncommitment in preparing for the tests. Employment tests\ncan be an important part of a neutral selection system\nthat safeguards against the very racial animosities Title\nVII was intended to prevent. Here, however, the firefight\ners saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reli\nance upon race-based statistics.\n   If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candi\ndates’ race, §2000e–2(l), then it follows a fortiori that it\nmay not take the greater step of discarding the test alto\ngether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of\npromotion-eligible candidates—absent a strong basis in\nevidence that the test was deficient and that discarding\nthe results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate\nimpact provision. Restricting an employer’s ability to\ndiscard test results (and thereby discriminate against\nqualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in\nkeeping with Title VII’s express protection of bona fide\npromotional examinations.

We also do not hold that meeting the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard would satisfy the Equal\nProtection Clause in a future case. As we explain below,\nbecause respondents have not met their burden under\nTitle VII, we need not decide whether a legitimate fear of\ndisparate impact is ever sufficient to justify discriminatory\ntreatment under the Constitution.\n  Nor do we question an employer’s affirmative efforts to\nensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for\npromotions and to participate in the process by which\npromotions will be made. But once that process has been\nestablished and employers have made clear their selection\ncriteria, they may not then invalidate the test results,\nthus upsetting an employee’s legitimate expectation not to\nbe judged on the basis of race. Doing so, absent a strong\nbasis in evidence of an impermissible disparate impact,\namounts to the sort of racial preference that Congress has\ndisclaimed, §2000e–2(j), and is antithetical to the notion of\na workplace where individuals are guaranteed equal\nopportunity regardless of race.\n  Title VII does not prohibit an employer from consider\ning, before administering a test or practice, how to design\nthat test or practice in order to provide a fair opportunity\nfor all individuals, regardless of their race. And when,\nduring the test-design stage, an employer invites com\n\f26                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nments to ensure the test is fair, that process can provide a\ncommon ground for open discussions toward that end. We\nhold only that, under Title VII, before an employer can\nengage in intentional discrimination for the asserted\npurpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional dispa\nrate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in\nevidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact\nliability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discrimina\ntory action.\n                              C\n   The City argues that, even under the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard, its decision to discard the examination\nresults was permissible under Title VII. That is incorrect.\nEven if respondents were motivated as a subjective matter\nby a desire to avoid committing disparate-impact dis\ncrimination, the record makes clear there is no support for\nthe conclusion that respondents had an objective, strong\nbasis in evidence to find the tests inadequate, with some\nconsequent disparate-impact liability in violation of Title\nVII.\n   On this basis, we conclude that petitioners have met\ntheir obligation to demonstrate that there is “no genuine\nissue as to any material fact” and that they are “entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed.

On the\ncaptain exam, the pass rate for white candidates was 64\npercent but was 37.5 percent for both black and Hispanic\ncandidates. On the lieutenant exam, the pass rate for\nwhite candidates was 58.1 percent; for black candidates,\n31.6 percent; and for Hispanic candidates, 20 percent. The\npass rates of minorities, which were approximately one\nhalf the pass rates for white candidates, fall well below the\n80-percent standard set by the EEOC to implement the\ndisparate-impact provision of Title VII. See 29 CFR\n§1607.4(D) (2008) (selection rate that is less than 80 per\ncent “of the rate for the group with the highest rate will\ngenerally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agen\ncies as evidence of adverse impact”); Watson, 487 U.

Based on\nhow the passing candidates ranked and an application of\nthe “rule of three,” certifying the examinations would have\nmeant that the City could not have considered black can\ndidates for any of the then-vacant lieutenant or captain\npositions.\n  Based on the degree of adverse impact reflected in the\nresults, respondents were compelled to take a hard look at\nthe examinations to determine whether certifying the\n\f28                  RICCI v.

That is because the City could be liable for dispa\nrate-impact discrimination only if the examinations were\nnot job related and consistent with business necessity, or if\nthere existed an equally valid, less-discriminatory alterna\ntive that served the City’s needs but that the City refused\nto adopt. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A), (C). We conclude there is no\nstrong basis in evidence to establish that the test was\ndeficient in either of these respects. We address each of\nthe two points in turn, based on the record developed by\nthe parties through discovery—a record that concentrates\nin substantial part on the statements various witnesses\nmade to the CSB.\n                              1\n  There is no genuine dispute that the examinations were\njob-related and consistent with business necessity. The\nCity’s assertions to the contrary are “blatantly contra\ndicted by the record.” Scott, supra, at 380. The CSB\nheard statements from Chad Legel (the IOS vice presi\ndent) as well as city officials outlining the detailed steps\nIOS took to develop and administer the examinations.\nIOS devised the written examinations, which were the\nfocus of the CSB’s inquiry, after painstaking analyses of\nthe captain and lieutenant positions—analyses in which\nIOS made sure that minorities were overrepresented. And\nIOS drew the questions from source material approved by\nthe Department. Of the outside witnesses who appeared\nbefore the CSB, only one, Vincent Lewis, had reviewed the\nexaminations in any detail, and he was the only one with\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nany firefighting experience. Lewis stated that the “ques\ntions were relevant for both exams.” CA2 App. A1053.\nThe only other witness who had seen any part of the ex\naminations, Christopher Hornick (a competitor of IOS’s),\ncriticized the fact that no one within the Department had\nreviewed the tests—a condition imposed by the City to\nprotect the integrity of the exams in light of past alleged\nsecurity breaches. But Hornick stated that the exams\n“appea[r] to be . . . reasonably good” and recommended that\nthe CSB certify the results. Id., at A1041.\n   Arguing that the examinations were not job-related,\nrespondents note some candidates’ complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not spe\ncifically apply to firefighting practices in New Haven. But\nLegel told the CSB that IOS had addressed those con\ncerns—that it entertained “a handful” of challenges to the\nvalidity of particular examination questions, that it “re\nviewed those challenges and provided feedback [to the\nCity] as to what we thought the best course of action was,”\nand that he could remember at least one question IOS had\nthrown out (“offer[ing] credit to everybody for that particu\nlar question”). Id., at A955–A957. For his part, Hornick\nsaid he “suspect[ed] that some of the criticisms . . . [lev\neled] by candidates” were not valid. Id., at A1035.\n   The City, moreover, turned a blind eye to evidence that\nsupported the exams’ validity. Although the City’s con\ntract with IOS contemplated that IOS would prepare a\ntechnical report consistent with EEOC guidelines for\nexamination-validity studies, the City made no request for\nits report. After the January 2004 meeting between Legel\nand some of the city-official respondents, in which Legel\ndefended the examinations, the City sought no further\ninformation from IOS, save its appearance at a CSB meet\ning to explain how it developed and administered the\nexaminations. IOS stood ready to provide respondents\nwith detailed information to establish the validity of the\n\f30                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexams, but respondents did not accept that offer.\n                              2\n   Respondents also lacked a strong basis in evidence of an\nequally valid, less-discriminatory testing alternative that\nthe City, by certifying the examination results, would\nnecessarily have refused to adopt. Respondents raise\nthree arguments to the contrary, but each argument fails.\nFirst, respondents refer to testimony before the CSB that\na different composite-score calculation—weighting the\nwritten and oral examination scores 30/70—would have\nallowed the City to consider two black candidates for then\nopen lieutenant positions and one black candidate for\nthen-open captain positions. (The City used a 60/40\nweighting as required by its contract with the New Haven\nfirefighters’ union.) But respondents have produced no\nevidence to show that the 60/40 weighting was indeed\narbitrary. In fact, because that formula was the result of a\nunion-negotiated collective-bargaining agreement, we\npresume the parties negotiated that weighting for a ra\ntional reason. Nor does the record contain any evidence\nthat the 30/70 weighting would be an equally valid way to\ndetermine whether candidates possess the proper mix of\njob knowledge and situational skills to earn promotions.\nChanging the weighting formula, moreover, could well\nhave violated Title VII’s prohibition of altering test scores\non the basis of race. See §2000e–2(l). On this record,\nthere is no basis to conclude that a 30/70 weighting was an\nequally valid alternative the City could have adopted.\n   Second, respondents argue that the City could have\nadopted a different interpretation of the “rule of three”\nthat would have produced less discriminatory results. The\nrule, in the New Haven city charter, requires the City to\npromote only from “those applicants with the three high\nest scores” on a promotional examination. New Haven,\nConn., Code of Ordinances, Tit. I, Art. XXX, §160 (1992).\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nA state court has interpreted the charter to prohibit so\ncalled “banding”—the City’s previous practice of rounding\nscores to the nearest whole number and considering all\ncandidates with the same whole-number score as being of\none rank. Banding allowed the City to consider three\nranks of candidates (with the possibility of multiple candi\ndates filling each rank) for purposes of the rule of three.\nSee Kelly v. New Haven, No. CV000444614, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">114377</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3 (Conn. Super. Ct., Jan. 9, 2004). Respondents\nclaim that employing banding here would have made four\nblack and one Hispanic candidates eligible for then-open\nlieutenant and captain positions.\n   A state court’s prohibition of banding, as a matter of\nmunicipal law under the charter, may not eliminate band\ning as a valid alternative under Title VII. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n§2000e–7. We need not resolve that point, however. Here,\nbanding was not a valid alternative for this reason: Had\nthe City reviewed the exam results and then adopted\nbanding to make the minority test scores appear higher, it\nwould have violated Title VII’s prohibition of adjusting\ntest results on the basis of race. §2000e–2(l); see also\nChicago Firefighters Local 2 v. Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773163\"><a href=\"/opinion/773163/chicago-firefighters-local-2-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656\n(CA7 2001) (Posner, J.) (“We have no doubt that if banding\nwere adopted in order to make lower black scores seem\nhigher, it would indeed be . . . forbidden”). As a matter of\nlaw, banding was not an alternative available to the City\nwhen it was considering whether to certify the examina\ntion results.\n   Third, and finally, respondents refer to statements by\nHornick in his telephone interview with the CSB regard\ning alternatives to the written examinations. Hornick\nstated his “belie[f]” that an “assessment center process,”\nwhich would have evaluated candidates’ behavior in typi\ncal job tasks, “would have demonstrated less adverse\nimpact.” CA2 App. A1039. But Hornick’s brief mention of\nalternative testing methods, standing alone, does not raise\n\f32                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na genuine issue of material fact that assessment centers\nwere available to the City at the time of the examinations\nand that they would have produced less adverse impact.\nOther statements to the CSB indicated that the Depart\nment could not have used assessment centers for the 2003\nexaminations. Supra, at 14. And although respondents\nlater argued to the CSB that Hornick had pushed the City\nto reject the test results, supra, at 15–17, the truth is that\nthe essence of Hornick’s remarks supported its certifying\nthe test results. See Scott, 550 U. S., at 380. Hornick\nstated that adverse impact in standardized testing “has\nbeen in existence since the beginning of testing,” CA2 App.\nA1037, and that the disparity in New Haven’s test results\nwas “somewhat higher but generally in the range that\nwe’ve seen professionally.” Id., at A1030–A1031. He told\nthe CSB he was “not suggesting” that IOS “somehow\ncreated a test that had adverse impacts that it should not\nhave had.” Id., at A1038. And he suggested that the CSB\nshould “certify the list as it exists.” Id., at A1041.\n  Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard applies, respondents cannot create a\ngenuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradic\ntory) statements in the record. And there is no doubt\nrespondents fall short of the mark by relying entirely on\nisolated statements by Hornick.              Hornick had not\n“stud[ied] the test at length or in detail.” Id., at A1030.\nAnd as he told the CSB, he is a “direct competitor” of\nIOS’s. Id., at A1029. The remainder of his remarks\nshowed that Hornick’s primary concern—somewhat to the\nfrustration of CSB members—was marketing his services\nfor the future, not commenting on the results of the tests\nthe City had already administered. See, e.g., id., at\nA1026, A1027, A1032, A1036, A1040, A1041. Hornick’s\nhinting had its intended effect: The City has since hired\nhim as a consultant. As for the other outside witnesses\nwho spoke to the CSB, Vincent Lewis (the retired fire\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncaptain) thought the CSB should certify the test results.\nAnd Janet Helms (the Boston College professor) declined\nto review the examinations and told the CSB that, as a\nsociety, “we need to develop a new way of assessing peo\nple.” Id., at A1073. That task was beyond the reach of the\nCSB, which was concerned with the adequacy of the test\nresults before it.\n                             3\n  On the record before us, there is no genuine dispute that\nthe City lacked a strong basis in evidence to believe it\nwould face disparate-impact liability if it certified the\nexamination results. In other words, there is no evidence\n—let alone the required strong basis in evidence—that the\ntests were flawed because they were not job-related or\nbecause other, equally valid and less discriminatory tests\nwere available to the City. Fear of litigation alone cannot\njustify an employer’s reliance on race to the detriment of\nindividuals who passed the examinations and qualified for\npromotions. The City’s discarding the test results was\nimpermissible under Title VII, and summary judgment is\nappropriate for petitioners on their disparate-treatment\nclaim.\n                          *    *     *\n   The record in this litigation documents a process that, at\nthe outset, had the potential to produce a testing proce\ndure that was true to the promise of Title VII: No individ\nual should face workplace discrimination based on race.\nRespondents thought about promotion qualifications and\nrelevant experience in neutral ways. They were careful to\nensure broad racial participation in the design of the test\nitself and its administration. As we have discussed at\nlength, the process was open and fair.\n   The problem, of course, is that after the tests were\ncompleted, the raw racial results became the predominant\n\f34                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrationale for the City’s refusal to certify the results. The\ninjury arises in part from the high, and justified, expecta\ntions of the candidates who had participated in the testing\nprocess on the terms the City had established for the\npromotional process. Many of the candidates had studied\nfor months, at considerable personal and financial ex\npense, and thus the injury caused by the City’s reliance on\nraw racial statistics at the end of the process was all the\nmore severe. Confronted with arguments both for and\nagainst certifying the test results—and threats of a law\nsuit either way—the City was required to make a difficult\ninquiry. But its hearings produced no strong evidence of a\ndisparate-impact violation, and the City was not entitled\nto disregard the tests based solely on the racial disparity\nin the results.\n   Our holding today clarifies how Title VII applies to\nresolve competing expectations under the disparate\ntreatment and disparate-impact provisions. If, after it\ncertifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact\nsuit, then in light of our holding today it should be clear\nthat the City would avoid disparate-impact liability based\non the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified\nthe results, it would have been subject to disparate\ntreatment liability.\n   Petitioners are entitled to summary judgment on their\nTitle VII claim, and we therefore need not decide the\nunderlying constitutional question. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

The question is not an easy one. See\ngenerally Primus, Equal Protection and Disparate Impact:\nRound Three, 117 Harv. L.

Would a private employer not be\nguilty of unlawful discrimination if he refrained from\nestablishing a racial hiring quota but intentionally de\nsigned his hiring practices to achieve the same end?\nSurely he would. Intentional discrimination is still occur\nring, just one step up the chain. Government compulsion\nof such design would therefore seemingly violate equal\nprotection principles. Nor would it matter that Title VII\nrequires consideration of race on a wholesale, rather than\nretail, level. “[T]he Government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, not as simply components of a racial, reli\ngious, sexual or national class.” Miller v.

See\npost, at 15–16, and n. 1 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (de\nscribing the demanding nature of the “business necessity”\ndefense). This is a question that this Court will have to\nconsider in due course. It is one thing to free plaintiffs\nfrom proving an employer’s illicit intent, but quite another\nto preclude the employer from proving that its motives\nwere pure and its actions reasonable.\n  The Court’s resolution of these cases makes it unneces\nsary to resolve these matters today. But the war between\ndisparate impact and equal protection will be waged\nsooner or later, and it behooves us to begin thinking about\nhow—and on what terms—to make peace between them.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

If\nthe reason provided by the employer is not legitimate on\nits face, the employer is liable. Id., at 509. The second,\nsubjective question concerns the employer’s intent. If an\nemployer offers a facially legitimate reason for its decision\nbut it turns out that this explanation was just a pretext\nfor discrimination, the employer is again liable. See id., at\n510–512.\n   The question on which the opinion of the Court and the\ndissenting opinion disagree concerns the objective compo\nnent of the determination that must be made when an\nemployer justifies an employment decision, like the one\nmade in this litigation, on the ground that a contrary\ndecision would have created a risk of disparate-impact\nliability. The Court holds—and I entirely agree—that\nconcern about disparate-impact liability is a legitimate\nreason for a decision of the type involved here only if there\nwas a “substantial basis in evidence to find the tests in\nadequate.” Ante, at 26. The Court ably demonstrates that\nin this litigation no reasonable jury could find that the city\nof New Haven (City) possessed such evidence and there\nfore summary judgment for petitioners is required. Be\ncause the Court correctly holds that respondents cannot\nsatisfy this objective component, the Court has no need to\ndiscuss the question of the respondents’ actual intent. As\nthe Court puts it, “[e]ven if respondents were motivated as\na subjective matter by a desire to avoid committing dispa\nrate-impact discrimination, the record makes clear there\nis no support for the conclusion that respondents had an\nobjective, substantial basis in evidence to find the tests\ninadequate.” Ibid.\n   The dissent advocates a different objective component of\nthe governing standard. According to the dissent, the\nobjective component should be whether the evidence pro\nvided “good cause” for the decision, post, at 19, and the\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

But even if the dissent were correct on this point, I\nassume that the dissent would not countenance summary\njudgment for respondents if respondents’ professed con\ncern about disparate-impact litigation was simply a pre\ntext. Therefore, the decision below, which sustained the\nentry of summary judgment for respondents, cannot be\naffirmed unless no reasonable jury could find that the\nCity’s asserted reason for scrapping its test—concern\nabout disparate-impact liability—was a pretext and that\nthe City’s real reason was illegitimate, namely, the desire\nto placate a politically important racial constituency.\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n   As initially described by the dissent, see post, at 2–12,\nthe process by which the City reached the decision not to\naccept the test results was open, honest, serious, and\ndeliberative. But even the District Court admitted that “a\njury could rationally infer that city officials worked behind\nthe scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations\nbecause they knew that, were the exams certified, the\nMayor would incur the wrath of [Rev.

On one occasion,\n“[i]n front of TV cameras, he threatened a race riot during\nthe murder trial of the black man arrested for killing\nwhite Yalie Christian Prince.

DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Reverend Kimber’s personal ties with seven-term New\nHaven Mayor John DeStefano (Mayor) stretch back more\nthan a decade. In 1996, for example, Mayor DeStefano\ntestified for Rev. Kimber as a character witness when Rev.\nKimber—then the manager of a funeral home—was prose\ncuted and convicted for stealing prepaid funeral expenses\nfrom an elderly woman and then lying about the matter\nunder oath. See id., at 126a, 907a. “Reverend Kimber has\nplayed a leadership role in all of Mayor DeStefano’s politi\ncal campaigns, [and] is considered a valuable political\nsupporter and vote-getter.” Id., at 126a. According to the\nMayor’s former campaign manager (who is currently his\nexecutive assistant), Rev. Kimber is an invaluable political\nasset because “[h]e’s very good at organizing people and\nputting together field operations, as a result of his ties to\nlabor, his prominence in the religious community and his\nlong-standing commitment to roots.” Id., at 908a (internal\nquotation marks and alteration omitted).\n  In 2002, the Mayor picked Rev. Kimber to serve as the\nChairman of the New Haven Board of Fire Commissioners\n(BFC), “despite the fact that he had no experience in the\nprofession, fire administration, [or] municipal manage\nment.” Id., at 127a; see also id., at 928a–929a. In that\ncapacity, Rev. Kimber told firefighters that certain new\nrecruits would not be hired because “ ‘they just have too\nmany vowels in their name[s].’ ” Thanawala, New Haven\nFire Panel Chairman Steps Down Over Racial Slur, Hart\nford Courant, June 13, 2002, p.

Kimber called the City’s\nChief Administrative Officer, Karen Dubois-Walton, who\n“acts ‘on behalf of the Mayor.’ ” Id., at 221a, 812a. Dubois\n\f                      Cite as: 557 U.

Kimber met privately in her office be\ncause he wanted “to express his opinion” about the test\nresults and “to have some influence” over the City’s re\nsponse. Id., at 815a–816a. As discussed in further detail\nbelow, Rev. Kimber adamantly opposed certification of the\ntest results—a fact that he or someone in the Mayor’s\noffice eventually conveyed to the Mayor. Id., at 229a.\n                              B\n  On January 12, 2004, Tina Burgett (the director of the\nCity’s Department of Human Resources) sent an e-mail to\nDubois-Walton to coordinate the City’s response to the test\nresults. Burgett wanted to clarify that the City’s executive\nofficials would meet “sans the Chief, and that once we had\na better fix on the next steps we would meet with the\nMayor (possibly) and then the two Chiefs.” Id., at 446a.\nThe “two Chiefs” are Fire Chief William Grant (who is\nwhite) and Assistant Fire Chief Ronald Dumas (who is\nAfrican-American). Both chiefs believed that the test\nresults should be certified. Id., at 228a, 817a. Petitioners\nallege, and the record suggests, that the Mayor and his\nstaff colluded “sans the Chief[s]” because “the defendants\ndid not want Grant’s or Dumas’ views to be publicly\nknown; accordingly both men were prevented by the\nMayor and his staff from making any statements regard\ning the matter.” Id., at 228a.1\n  The next day, on January 13, 2004, Chad Legel, who\nhad designed the tests, flew from Chicago to New Haven\nto meet with Dubois-Walton, Burgett, and Thomas Ude,\nthe City’s corporate counsel. Id., at 179a. “Legel outlined\nthe merits of the examination and why city officials should\nbe confident in the validity of the results.” Ibid. But\n——————\n  1 Although the dissent disputes it, see post, at 33–34, n. 17, the record\ncertainly permits the inference that petitioners’ allegation is true. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, pp. 846a–851a (deposition of\nDubois-Walton).\n\f6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\naccording to Legel, Dubois-Walton was “argumentative”\nand apparently had already made up her mind that the\ntests were “ ‘discriminatory.’ ” Id., at 179a–180a. Again\naccording to Legel, “[a] theme” of the meeting was “the\npolitical and racial overtones of what was going on in the\nCity.” Id., at 181a. “Legel came away from the January\n13, 2004 meeting with the impression that defendants\nwere already leaning toward discarding the examination\nresults.” Id., at 180a.\n  On January 22, 2004, the Civil Service Board (CSB or\nBoard) convened its first public meeting. Almost immedi\nately, Rev. Kimber began to exert political pressure on the\nCSB. He began a loud, minutes-long outburst that re\nquired the CSB Chairman to shout him down and hold\nhim out of order three times. See id., at 187a, 467a–468a;\nsee also App. in No. 06–4996–cv (CA2), pp. A703–A705.\nReverend Kimber protested the public meeting, arguing\nthat he and the other fire commissioners should first be\nallowed to meet with the CSB in private. App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 07–1428, at 188a.\n  Four days after the CSB’s first meeting, Mayor DeSte\nfano’s executive aide sent an e-mail to Dubois-Walton,\nBurgett, and Ude. Id., at 190a. The message clearly\nindicated that the Mayor had made up his mind to oppose\ncertification of the test results (but nevertheless wanted to\nconceal that fact from the public):\n    “I wanted to make sure we are all on the same page\n    for this meeting tomorrow. . . . [L]et’s remember, that\n    these folks are not against certification yet. So we\n    can’t go in and tell them that is our position; we have\n    to deliberate and arrive there as the fairest and most\n    cogent outcome.” Ibid.\n  On February 5, 2004, the CSB convened its second\npublic meeting. Reverend Kimber again testified and\nthreatened the CSB with political recriminations if they\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nvoted to certify the test results:\n    “I look at this [Board] tonight. I look at three whites\n    and one Hispanic and no blacks. . . . I would hope that\n    you would not put yourself in this type of position, a\n    political ramification that may come back upon you as\n    you sit on this [Board] and decide the future of a\n    department and the future of those who are being\n    promoted.\n    .           .           .          .           .\n    “(APPLAUSE).” Id., at 492a (emphasis added).\nOne of the CSB members “t[ook] great offense” because he\nbelieved that Rev. Kimber “consider[ed] [him] a bigot\nbecause [his] face is white.” Id., at 496a. The offended\nCSB member eventually voted not to certify the test re\nsults. Id., at 586a–587a.\n   One of Rev. Kimber’s “friends and allies,” Lieutenant\nGary Tinney, also exacerbated racial tensions before the\nCSB. Id., at 129a. After some firefighters applauded in\nsupport of certifying the test results, “Lt. Tinney ex\nclaimed, ‘Listen to the Klansmen behind us.’ ” Id., at 225a.\n   Tinney also has strong ties to the Mayor’s office. See,\ne.g., id., at 129a–130a, 816a–817a. After learning that he\nhad not scored well enough on the captain’s exam to earn\na promotion, Tinney called Dubois-Walton and arranged a\nmeeting in her office. Id., at 830a–831a, 836a. Tinney\nalleged that the white firefighters had cheated on their\nexams—an accusation that Dubois-Walton conveyed to the\nBoard without first conducting an investigation into its\nveracity. Id., at 837a–838a; see also App. 164 (statement\nof CSB Chairman, noting the allegations of cheating). The\nallegation turned out to be baseless. App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 07–1428, at 836a.\n   Dubois-Walton never retracted the cheating allegation,\nbut she and other executive officials testified several times\nbefore the CSB. In accordance with directions from the\n\f8                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nMayor’s office to make the CSB meetings appear delibera\ntive, see id., at 190a, executive officials remained publicly\nuncommitted about certification—while simultaneously\n“work[ing] as a team” behind closed doors with the secre\ntary of the CSB to devise a political message that would\nconvince the CSB to vote against certification, see id., at\n447a. At the public CSB meeting on March 11, 2004, for\nexample, Corporation Counsel Ude bristled at one board\nmember’s suggestion that City officials were recommend\ning against certifying the test results. See id., at 215a\n(“Attorney Ude took offense, stating, ‘Frankly, because I\nwould never make a recommendation—I would not have\nmade a recommendation like that’ ”). But within days of\nmaking that public statement, Ude privately told other\nmembers of the Mayor’s team “the ONLY way we get to a\ndecision not to certify is” to focus on something other than\n“a big discussion re: adverse impact” law. Id., at 458a–\n459a.\n   As part of its effort to deflect attention from the specifics\nof the test, the City relied heavily on the testimony of Dr.\nChristopher Hornick, who is one of Chad Legel’s competi\ntors in the test-development business. Hornick never\n“stud[ied] the test [that Legel developed] at length or in\ndetail,” id., at 549a; see also id., at 203a, 553a, but Hor\nnick did review and rely upon literature sent to him by\nBurgett to criticize Legel’s test. For example, Hornick\n“noted in the literature that [Burgett] sent that the test\nwas not customized to the New Haven Fire Department.”\nId., at 551a. The Chairman of the CSB immediately cor\nrected Hornick. Id., at 552a (“Actually, it was, Dr. Hor\nnick”). Hornick also relied on newspaper accounts—again,\nsent to him by Burgett—pertaining to the controversy\nsurrounding the certification decision. See id., at 204a,\n557a. Although Hornick again admitted that he had no\nknowledge about the actual test that Legel had developed\nand that the City had administered, see id., at 560a–561a,\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          ALITO, J., concurring\n\nthe City repeatedly relied upon Hornick as a testing\n“guru” and, in the CSB Chairman’s words, “the City ke[pt]\nquoting him as a person that we should rely upon more\nthan anybody else [to conclude that there] is a better\nway—a better mousetrap.”2 App. in No. 06–4996–cv\n(CA2), at A1128. Dubois-Walton later admitted that the\nCity rewarded Hornick for his testimony by hiring him to\ndevelop and administer an alternative test. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 07–1428, at 854a; see also id., at 562a–\n563a (Hornick’s plea for future business from the City on\nthe basis of his criticisms of Legel’s tests).\n   At some point prior to the CSB’s public meeting on\nMarch 18, 2004, the Mayor decided to use his executive\nauthority to disregard the test results—even if the CSB\nultimately voted to certify them. Id., at 819a–820a. Ac\ncordingly, on the evening of March 17th, Dubois-Walton\nsent an e-mail to the Mayor, the Mayor’s executive assis\ntant, Burgett, and attorney Ude, attaching two alternative\npress releases. Id., at 457a. The first would be issued if\nthe CSB voted not to certify the test results; the second\nwould be issued (and would explain the Mayor’s invocation\nof his executive authority) if the CSB voted to certify the\ntest results. Id., at 217a–218a, 590a–591a, 819a–820a.\nHalf an hour after Dubois-Walton circulated the alterna\ntive drafts, Burgett replied: “[W]ell, that seems to say it\nall. Let’s hope draft #2 hits the shredder tomorrow nite.”\nId., at 457a.\n\n——————\n  2 The City’s heavy reliance on Hornick’s testimony makes the two\n\nchiefs’ silence all the more striking. See supra, at 5. While Hornick\nknew little or nothing about the tests he criticized, the two chiefs were\ninvolved “during the lengthy process that led to the devising of the\nadministration of these exams,” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428,\nat 847a, including “collaborating with City officials on the extensive job\nanalyses that were done,” “selection of the oral panelists,” and selection\nof “the proper content and subject matter of the exams,” id., at 847a–\n848a.\n\f10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Soon after the CSB voted against certification, Mayor\nDeStefano appeared at a dinner event and “took credit for\nthe scu[tt]ling of the examination results.” Id., at 230a.\n                              C\n   Taking into account all the evidence in the summary\njudgment record, a reasonable jury could find the follow\ning. Almost as soon as the City disclosed the racial\nmakeup of the list of firefighters who scored the highest on\nthe exam, the City administration was lobbied by an\ninfluential community leader to scrap the test results, and\nthe City administration decided on that course of action\nbefore making any real assessment of the possibility of a\ndisparate-impact violation. To achieve that end, the City\nadministration concealed its internal decision but\nworked—as things turned out, successfully—to persuade\nthe CSB that acceptance of the test results would be ille\ngal and would expose the City to disparate-impact liabil\nity. But in the event that the CSB was not persuaded, the\nMayor, wielding ultimate decisionmaking authority, was\nprepared to overrule the CSB immediately. Taking this\nview of the evidence, a reasonable jury could easily find\nthat the City’s real reason for scrapping the test results\nwas not a concern about violating the disparate-impact\nprovision of Title VII but a simple desire to please a politi\ncally important racial constituency. It is noteworthy that\nthe Solicitor General—whose position on the principal\nlegal issue in this case is largely aligned with the dis\nsent—concludes that “[n]either the district court nor the\ncourt of appeals . . . adequately considered whether, view\ning the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioners,\na genuine issue of material fact remained whether respon\ndents’ claimed purpose to comply with Title VII was a\npretext for intentional racial discrimination . . . .” Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 6; see also id., at 32–\n33.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

The dissent misrepresents my posi\ntion: I draw no such equation. Of course “there are many\nways in which a politician can attempt to win over a con\nstituency—including a racial constituency—without en\ngaging in unlawful discrimination.” Post, at 36–37. But—\nas I assume the dissent would agree—there are some\nthings that a public official cannot do, and one of those is\nengaging in intentional racial discrimination when mak\ning employment decisions.\n   The second point concerns the dissent’s main argu\nment—that efforts by the Mayor and his staff to scuttle\nthe test results are irrelevant because the ultimate deci\nsion was made by the CSB. According to the dissent,\n“[t]he relevant decision was made by the CSB,” post, at 34,\nand there is “scant cause to suspect” that anything done\nby the opponents of certification, including the Mayor and\nhis staff, “prevented the CSB from evenhandedly assess\ning the reliability of the exams and rendering an inde\npendent, good-faith decision on certification,” post, at 36.\n   Adoption of the dissent’s argument would implicitly\ndecide an important question of Title VII law that this\nCourt has never resolved—the circumstances in which an\nemployer may be held liable based on the discriminatory\nintent of subordinate employees who influence but do not\nmake the ultimate employment decision. There is a large\nbody of court of appeals case law on this issue, and these\ncases disagree about the proper standard.

After all, the Mayor claimed that authority\nand was poised to use it in the event that the CSB decided\nto accept the test results. See supra, at 9. If the Mayor\nhad the authority to overrule a CSB decision accepting the\ntest results, the Mayor also presumably had the authority\nto overrule the CSB’s decision rejecting the test results.

At that time,\nmunicipal fire departments across the country, including\nNew Haven’s, pervasively discriminated against minori\nties. The extension of Title VII to cover jobs in firefighting\neffected no overnight change. It took decades of persistent\neffort, advanced by Title VII litigation, to open firefighting\nposts to members of racial minorities.\n   The white firefighters who scored high on New Haven’s\npromotional exams understandably attract this Court’s\nsympathy. But they had no vested right to promotion.\nNor have other persons received promotions in preference\nto them.

That\npretension, essential to the Court’s disposition, ignores\nsubstantial evidence of multiple flaws in the tests New\nHaven used. The Court similarly fails to acknowledge the\nbetter tests used in other cities, which have yielded less\nracially skewed outcomes.1\n   By order of this Court, New Haven, a city in which\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics account for nearly 60\npercent of the population, must today be served—as it was\nin the days of undisguised discrimination—by a fire de\npartment in which members of racial and ethnic minori\nties are rarely seen in command positions.

See ante, at 4–9. Even\na detached and disinterested observer, however, would have every\nreason to ask: Why did such racially skewed results occur in New\nHaven, when better tests likely would have produced less dispropor\ntionate results?\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

R. Rep. No. 92–\n238, p. 17 (1971). According to the report, overt racism\nwas partly to blame, but so too was a failure on the part of\nmunicipal employers to apply merit-based employment\nprinciples. In making hiring and promotion decisions,\npublic employers often “rel[ied] on criteria unrelated to job\nperformance,” including nepotism or political patronage.\n118 Cong. Rec. 1817 (1972). Such flawed selection meth\nods served to entrench preexisting racial hierarchies. The\nUSCCR report singled out police and fire departments for\nhaving “[b]arriers to equal employment . . . greater . . .\nthan in any other area of State or local government,” with\nAfrican-Americans “hold[ing] almost no positions in the\nofficer ranks.” Ibid. See also National Commission on\nFire Prevention and Control, America Burning 5 (1973)\n(“Racial minorities are under-represented in the fire de\npartments in nearly every community in which they\nlive.”).\n   The city of New Haven (City) was no exception. In the\nearly 1970’s, African-Americans and Hispanics composed\n30 percent of New Haven’s population, but only 3.6 per\ncent of the City’s 502 firefighters. The racial disparity in\nthe officer ranks was even more pronounced: “[O]f the 107\nofficers in the Department only one was black, and he held\nthe lowest rank above private.” Firebird Soc. of New\nHaven, Inc. v. New Haven Bd. of Fire Comm’rs, 66 F. R. D.\n457, 460 (Conn. 1975).\n   Following a lawsuit and settlement agreement, see ibid.,\nthe City initiated efforts to increase minority representa\ntion in the New Haven Fire Department (Department).\nThose litigation-induced efforts produced some positive\nchange. New Haven’s population includes a greater pro\nportion of minorities today than it did in the 1970’s:\nNearly 40 percent of the City’s residents are African\n\f4                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAmerican and more than 20 percent are Hispanic. Among\nentry-level firefighters, minorities are still underrepre\nsented, but not starkly so. As of 2003, African-Americans\nand Hispanics constituted 30 percent and 16 percent of the\nCity’s firefighters, respectively. In supervisory positions,\nhowever, significant disparities remain. Overall, the\nsenior officer ranks (captain and higher) are nine percent\nAfrican-American and nine percent Hispanic. Only one of\nthe Department’s 21 fire captains is African-American.\nSee App. in No. 06–4996–cv (CA2), p. A1588 (hereinafter\nCA2 App.). It is against this backdrop of entrenched\ninequality that the promotion process at issue in this\nlitigation should be assessed.\n                             B\n   By order of its charter, New Haven must use competi\ntive examinations to fill vacancies in fire officer and other\ncivil-service positions. Such examinations, the City’s civil\nservice rules specify, “shall be practical in nature, shall\nrelate to matters which fairly measure the relative fitness\nand capacity of the applicants to discharge the duties of\nthe position which they seek, and shall take into account\ncharacter, training, experience, physical and mental fit\nness.” Id., at A331. The City may choose among a variety\nof testing methods, including written and oral exams and\n“[p]erformance tests to demonstrate skill and ability in\nperforming actual work.” Id., at A332.\n   New Haven, the record indicates, did not closely con\nsider what sort of “practical” examination would “fairly\nmeasure the relative fitness and capacity of the applicants\nto discharge the duties” of a fire officer. Instead, the City\nsimply adhered to the testing regime outlined in its two\ndecades-old contract with the local firefighters’ union: a\nwritten exam, which would account for 60 percent of an\napplicant’s total score, and an oral exam, which would\naccount for the remaining 40 percent. Id., at A1045. In\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsoliciting bids from exam development companies, New\nHaven made clear that it would entertain only “proposals\nthat include a written component that will be weighted at\n60%, and an oral component that will be weighted at\n40%.” Id., at A342. Chad Legel, a representative of the\nwinning bidder, Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc.\n(IOS), testified during his deposition that the City never\nasked whether alternative methods might better measure\nthe qualities of a successful fire officer, including leader\nship skills and command presence. See id., at A522 (“I\nwas under contract and had responsibility only to create\nthe oral interview and the written exam.”).\n   Pursuant to New Haven’s specifications, IOS developed\nand administered the oral and written exams. The results\nshowed significant racial disparities. On the lieutenant\nexam, the pass rate for African-American candidates was\nabout one-half the rate for Caucasian candidates; the pass\nrate for Hispanic candidates was even lower. On the\ncaptain exam, both African-American and Hispanic candi\ndates passed at about half the rate of their Caucasian\ncounterparts. See App. 225–226. More striking still,\nalthough nearly half of the 77 lieutenant candidates were\nAfrican-American or Hispanic, none would have been\neligible for promotion to the eight positions then vacant.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n13th; the top Hispanic candidate was 26th. As for the\nseven then-vacant captain positions, two Hispanic candi\ndates would have been eligible, but no African-Americans.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n15th. See id., at 218–219.\n   These stark disparities, the Court acknowledges, suf\nficed to state a prima facie case under Title VII’s dispa\nrate-impact provision. See ante, at 27 (“The pass rates of\nminorities . . . f[e]ll well below the 80-percent standard set\nby the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC)] to implement the disparate-impact provision of\n\f6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nTitle VII.”). New Haven thus had cause for concern about\nthe prospect of Title VII litigation and liability. City\nofficials referred the matter to the New Haven Civil Ser\nvice Board (CSB), the entity responsible for certifying the\nresults of employment exams.\n   Between January and March 2004, the CSB held five\npublic meetings to consider the proper course. At the first\nmeeting, New Haven’s Corporation Counsel, Thomas Ude,\ndescribed the legal standard governing Title VII disparate\nimpact claims. Statistical imbalances alone, Ude correctly\nrecognized, do not give rise to liability. Instead, presented\nwith a disparity, an employer “has the opportunity and the\nburden of proving that the test is job-related and consis\ntent with business necessity.” CA2 App. A724. A Title VII\nplaintiff may attempt to rebut an employer’s showing of\njob-relatedness and necessity by identifying alternative\nselection methods that would have been at least as valid\nbut with “less of an adverse or disparate or discriminatory\neffect.” Ibid. See also id., at A738. Accordingly, the CSB\nCommissioners understood, their principal task was to\ndecide whether they were confident about the reliability of\nthe exams: Had the exams fairly measured the qualities of\na successful fire officer despite their disparate results?\nMight an alternative examination process have identified\nthe most qualified candidates without creating such sig\nnificant racial imbalances?\n   Seeking a range of input on these questions, the CSB\nheard from test takers, the test designer, subject-matter\nexperts, City officials, union leaders, and community\nmembers. Several candidates for promotion, who did not\nyet know their exam results, spoke at the CSB’s first two\nmeetings. Some candidates favored certification. The\nexams, they emphasized, had closely tracked the assigned\nstudy materials. Having invested substantial time and\nmoney to prepare themselves for the test, they felt it\nwould be unfair to scrap the results. See, e.g., id., at\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nA772–A773, A785–A789.\n   Other firefighters had a different view. A number of the\nexam questions, they pointed out, were not germane to\nNew Haven’s practices and procedures. See, e.g., id., at\nA774–A784. At least two candidates opposed to certifica\ntion noted unequal access to study materials. Some indi\nviduals, they asserted, had the necessary books even\nbefore the syllabus was issued. Others had to invest\nsubstantial sums to purchase the materials and “wait a\nmonth and a half for some of the books because they were\non back-order.” Id., at A858. These disparities, it was\nsuggested, fell at least in part along racial lines. While\nmany Caucasian applicants could obtain materials and\nassistance from relatives in the fire service, the over\nwhelming majority of minority applicants were “first\ngeneration firefighters” without such support networks.\nSee id., at A857–A861, A886–A887.\n   A representative of the Northeast Region of the Interna\ntional Association of Black Professional Firefighters,\nDonald Day, also spoke at the second meeting. Statistical\ndisparities, he told the CSB, had been present in the\nDepartment’s previous promotional exams. On earlier\ntests, however, a few minority candidates had fared well\nenough to earn promotions. Id., at A828. See also App.\n218–219. Day contrasted New Haven’s experience with\nthat of nearby Bridgeport, where minority firefighters held\none-third of lieutenant and captain positions. Bridgeport,\nDay observed, had once used a testing process similar to\nNew Haven’s, with a written exam accounting for 70\npercent of an applicant’s score, an oral exam for 25 per\ncent, and seniority for the remaining five percent. CA2\nApp. A830. Bridgeport recognized, however, that the oral\ncomponent, more so than the written component, ad\ndressed the sort of “real-life scenarios” fire officers encoun\nter on the job. Id., at A832. Accordingly, that city\n“changed the relative weights” to give primacy to the oral\n\f8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nexam. Ibid. Since that time, Day reported, Bridgeport\nhad seen minorities “fairly represented” in its exam re\nsults. Ibid.\n   The CSB’s third meeting featured IOS representative\nLegel, the leader of the team that had designed and ad\nministered the exams for New Haven. Several City offi\ncials also participated in the discussion. Legel described\nthe exam development process in detail. The City, he\nrecounted, had set the “parameters” for the exams, specifi\ncally, the requirement of written and oral components\nwith a 60/40 weighting. Id., at A923, A974. For security\nreasons, Department officials had not been permitted to\ncheck the content of the questions prior to their admini\nstration. Instead, IOS retained a senior fire officer from\nGeorgia to review the exams “for content and fidelity to\nthe source material.” Id., at A936. Legel defended the\nexams as “facially neutral,” and stated that he “would\nstand by the[ir] validity.” Id., at A962. City officials did\nnot dispute the neutrality of IOS’s work. But, they cau\ntioned, even if individual exam questions had no intrinsic\nbias, the selection process as a whole may nevertheless\nhave been deficient. The officials urged the CSB to consult\nwith experts about the “larger picture.” Id., at A1012.\n   At its fourth meeting, CSB solicited the views of three\nindividuals with testing-related expertise. Dr. Christo\npher Hornick, an industrial/organizational psychology\nconsultant with 25 years’ experience with police and fire\nfighter testing, described the exam results as having\n“relatively high adverse impact.” Id., at A1028. Most of\nthe tests he had developed, Hornick stated, exhibited\n“significantly and dramatically less adverse impact.” Id.,\nat A1029. Hornick downplayed the notion of “facial neu\ntrality.” It was more important, he advised the CSB, to\nconsider “the broader issue of how your procedures and\nyour rules and the types of tests that you are using are\ncontributing to the adverse impact.” Id., at A1038.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n    Specifically, Hornick questioned New Haven’s union\nprompted 60/40 written/oral examination structure, noting\nthe availability of “different types of testing procedures\nthat are much more valid in terms of identifying the best\npotential supervisors in [the] fire department.” Id., at\nA1032. He suggested, for example, “an assessment center\nprocess, which is essentially an opportunity for candidates\n. . . to demonstrate how they would address a particular\nproblem as opposed to just verbally saying it or identifying\nthe correct option on a written test.” Id., at A1039–A1040.\nSuch selection processes, Hornick said, better “identif[y]\nthe best possible people” and “demonstrate dramatically\nless adverse impacts.” Ibid. Hornick added:\n    “I’ve spoken to at least 10,000, maybe 15,000 fire\n    fighters in group settings in my consulting practice\n    and I have never one time ever had anyone in the fire\n    service say to me, ‘Well, the person who answers—\n    gets the highest score on a written job knowledge,\n    multiple-guess test makes the best company officer.’\n    We know that it’s not as valid as other procedures\n    that exist.” Id., at A1033.\nSee also id., at A1042–A1043 (“I think a person’s leader\nship skills, their command presence, their interpersonal\nskills, their management skills, their tactical skills could\nhave been identified and evaluated in a much more appro\npriate way.”).\n   Hornick described the written test itself as “reasonably\ngood,” id., at A1041, but he criticized the decision not to\nallow Department officials to check the content. According\nto Hornick, this “inevitably” led to “test[ing] for processes\nand procedures that don’t necessarily match up into the\ndepartment.” Id., at A1034–A1035. He preferred “experts\nfrom within the department who have signed confidential\nity agreements . . . to make sure that the terminology and\nequipment that’s being identified from standardized read\n\f10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ning sources apply to the department.” Id., at A1035.\n   Asked whether he thought the City should certify the\nresults, Hornick hedged: “There is adverse impact in the\ntest. That will be identified in any proceeding that you\nhave. You will have industrial psychology experts, if it\ngoes to court, on both sides. And it will not be a pretty or\ncomfortable position for anyone to be in.” Id., at A1040–\nA1041. Perhaps, he suggested, New Haven might certify\nthe results but immediately begin exploring “alternative\nways to deal with these issues” in the future. Id., at\nA1041.\n   The two other witnesses made relatively brief appear\nances. Vincent Lewis, a specialist with the Department of\nHomeland Security and former fire officer in Michigan,\nbelieved the exams had generally tested relevant material,\nalthough he noted a relatively heavy emphasis on ques\ntions pertaining to being an “apparatus driver.” He sug\ngested that this may have disadvantaged test takers “who\nhad not had the training or had not had an opportunity to\ndrive the apparatus.” Id., at A1051. He also urged the\nCSB to consider whether candidates had, in fact, enjoyed\nequal access to the study materials. Ibid. Cf. supra, at 7.\n   Janet Helms, a professor of counseling psychology at\nBoston College, observed that two-thirds of the incumbent\nfire officers who submitted job analyses to IOS during the\nexam design phase were Caucasian. Members of different\nracial groups, Helms told the CSB, sometimes do their jobs\nin different ways, “often because the experiences that are\nopen to white male firefighters are not open to members of\nthese other under-represented groups.” CA2 App. A1063–\nA1064. The heavy reliance on job analyses from white\nfirefighters, she suggested, may thus have introduced an\nelement of bias. Id., at A1063.\n   The CSB’s fifth and final meeting began with state\nments from City officials recommending against certifica\ntion. Ude, New Haven’s counsel, repeated the applicable\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

Where a\n    procedure demonstrates adverse impact, you look to\n    how closely it is related to the job that you’re looking\n    to fill and you also look at whether there are other\n    ways to test for those qualities, those traits, those po\n    sitions that are equally valid with less adverse im\n    pact.” Id., at A1100–A1101.\nNew Haven, Ude and other officials asserted, would be\nvulnerable to Title VII liability under this standard. Even\nif the exams were “facially neutral,” significant doubts had\nbeen raised about whether they properly assessed the key\nattributes of a successful fire officer. Id., at A1103. See\nalso id., at A1125 (“Upon close reading of the exams, the\nquestions themselves would appear to test a candidate’s\nability to memorize textbooks but not necessarily to iden\ntify solutions to real problems on the fire ground.”). More\nover, City officials reminded the CSB, Hornick and others\nhad identified better, less discriminatory selection meth\nods–such as assessment centers or exams with a more\nheavily weighted oral component. Id., at A1108–A1109,\nA1129–A1130.\n   After giving members of the public a final chance to\nweigh in, the CSB voted on certification, dividing 2 to 2.\nBy rule, the result was noncertification. Voting no, Com\nmissioner Webber stated, “I originally was going to vote to\ncertify. . . . But I’ve heard enough testimony here to give\nme great doubts about the test itself and . . . some of the\nprocedures. And I believe we can do better.” Id., at\nA1157. Commissioner Tirado likewise concluded that the\n“flawed” testing process counseled against certification.\nId., at A1158. Chairman Segaloff and Commissioner\nCaplan voted to certify. According to Segaloff, the testi\nmony had not “compelled [him] to say this exam was not\n\f12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\njob-related,” and he was unconvinced that alternative\nselection processes would be “less discriminatory.” Id., at\nA1159–A1160. Both Segalhoff and Caplan, however,\nurged the City to undertake civil service reform. Id., at\nA1150–A1154.\n                                C\n   Following the CSB’s vote, petitioners—17 white fire\nfighters and one Hispanic firefighter, all of whom had high\nmarks on the exams—filed suit in the United States Dis\ntrict Court for the District of Connecticut. They named as\ndefendants—respondents here—the City, several City\nofficials, a local political activist, and the two CSB mem\nbers who voted against certifying the results. By opposing\ncertification, petitioners alleged, respondents had dis\ncriminated against them in violation of Title VII’s dispa\nrate-treatment provision and the Fourteenth Amend\nment’s Equal Protection Clause. The decision not to\ncertify, respondents answered, was a lawful effort to com\nply with Title VII’s disparate-impact provision and thus\ncould not have run afoul of Title VII’s prohibition of dispa\nrate treatment. Characterizing respondents’ stated ra\ntionale as a mere pretext, petitioners insisted that New\nHaven would have had a solid defense to any disparate\nimpact suit.\n   In a decision summarily affirmed by the Court of Ap\npeals, the District Court granted summary judgment for\nrespondents. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

And, as the CSB testimony of Hornick and others\nindicated, overcoming that presumption would have been\nno easy task. Id., at 153–156. Given Title VII’s preference\nfor voluntary compliance, the court held, New Haven could\nlawfully discard the disputed exams even if the City had\nnot definitively “pinpoint[ed]” the source of the disparity\nand “ha[d] not yet formulated a better selection method.”\nId., at 156.\n  Respondents were no doubt conscious of race during\ntheir decisionmaking process, the court acknowledged, but\nthis did not mean they had engaged in racially disparate\ntreatment. The conclusion they had reached and the\naction thereupon taken were race-neutral in this sense:\n“[A]ll the test results were discarded, no one was pro\nmoted, and firefighters of every race will have to partici\npate in another selection process to be considered for\npromotion.” Id., at 158.

Congress, the\nlandmark decision recognized, aimed beyond “disparate\ntreatment”; it targeted “disparate impact” as well. Title\nVII’s original text, it was plain to the Court, “proscribe[d]\nnot only overt discrimination but also practices that are\nfair in form, but discriminatory in operation.” Id., at 431.2\nOnly by ignoring Griggs could one maintain that inten\ntionally disparate treatment alone was Title VII’s “origi\nnal, foundational prohibition,” and disparate impact a\nmere afterthought.

Here, Title VII’s disparate-treatment\nand disparate-impact proscriptions must be read as\ncomplementary.\n  In codifying the Griggs and Albemarle instructions,\nCongress declared unambiguously that selection criteria\noperating to the disadvantage of minority group members\ncan be retained only if justified by business necessity.5 In\nkeeping with Congress’ design, employers who reject such\ncriteria due to reasonable doubts about their reliability\ncan hardly be held to have engaged in discrimination\n“because of” race. A reasonable endeavor to comply with\nthe law and to ensure that qualified candidates of all races\nhave a fair opportunity to compete is simply not what\nCongress meant to interdict. I would therefore hold that\nan employer who jettisons a selection device when its\ndisproportionate racial impact becomes apparent does not\nviolate Title VII’s disparate-treatment bar automatically\nor at all, subject to this key condition: The employer must\nhave good cause to believe the device would not withstand\nexamination for business necessity.

The strong-basis-in-evidence standard,\nhowever, as barely described in general, and cavalierly\napplied in this case, makes voluntary compliance a haz\nardous venture.\n   As a result of today’s decision, an employer who discards\na dubious selection process can anticipate costly disparate\ntreatment litigation in which its chances for success—even\nfor surviving a summary-judgment motion—are highly\nproblematic. Concern about exposure to disparate-impact\nliability, however well grounded, is insufficient to insulate\nan employer from attack. Instead, the employer must\nmake a “strong” showing that (1) its selection method was\n“not job related and consistent with business necessity,” or\n(2) that it refused to adopt “an equally valid, less\ndiscriminatory alternative.” Ante, at 28. It is hard to see\nhow these requirements differ from demanding that an\nemployer establish “a provable, actual violation” against\nitself. Cf. ante, at 24. There is indeed a sharp conflict\nhere, but it is not the false one the Court describes be\ntween Title VII’s core provisions. It is, instead, the discor\ndance of the Court’s opinion with the voluntary compli\nance ideal. Cf. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 290 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“The\nimposition of a requirement that public employers make\nfindings that they have engaged in illegal discrimina-\ntion before they [act] would severely undermine public\nemployers’ incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights\nobligations.”).7\n——————\n  7 Notably,prior decisions applying a strong-basis-in-evidence stan\ndard have not imposed a burden as heavy as the one the Court imposes\ntoday.

This\nrationale puts the cart before the horse. The legitimacy of\nan employee’s expectation depends on the legitimacy of the\nselection method. If an employer reasonably concludes\nthat an exam fails to identify the most qualified individu\nals and needlessly shuts out a segment of the applicant\npool, Title VII surely does not compel the employer to hire\nor promote based on the test, however unreliable it may\nbe. Indeed, the statute’s prime objective is to prevent\nexclusionary practices from “operat[ing] to ‘freeze’ the\nstatus quo.” Griggs, 401 U. S., at 430.\n  Second, the Court suggests, anything less than a strong\nbasis-in-evidence standard risks creating “a de facto quota\nsystem, in which . . . an employer could discard test re\nsults . . . with the intent of obtaining the employer’s pre\nferred racial balance.” Ante, at 22. Under a reasonable\nness standard, however, an employer could not cast aside\na selection method based on a statistical disparity alone.8\nThe employer must have good cause to believe that the\nmethod screens out qualified applicants and would be\ndifficult to justify as grounded in business necessity.\n\n——————\ntions” for liability are present.

When this Court formulates a\nnew legal rule, the ordinary course is to remand and allow\nthe lower courts to apply the rule in the first instance.\nSee, e.g., Johnson v.

Judged by that stan\ndard, petitioners have not shown that New Haven’s failure\nto certify the exam results violated Title VII’s disparate\ntreatment provision.10\n   The City, all agree, “was faced with a prima facie case of\ndisparate-impact liability,” ante, at 27: The pass rate for\nminority candidates was half the rate for nonminority\ncandidates, and virtually no minority candidates would\nhave been eligible for promotion had the exam results\nbeen certified. Alerted to this stark disparity, the CSB\nheard expert and lay testimony, presented at public hear\nings, in an endeavor to ascertain whether the exams were\nfair and consistent with business necessity. Its investiga\ntion revealed grave cause for concern about the exam\nprocess itself and the City’s failure to consider alternative\nselection devices.\n   Chief among the City’s problems was the very nature of\nthe tests for promotion. In choosing to use written and\noral exams with a 60/40 weighting, the City simply ad\nhered to the union’s preference and apparently gave no\nconsideration to whether the weighting was likely to\nidentify the most qualified fire-officer candidates.11 There\n——————\n   10 The lower courts focused on respondents’ “intent” rather than on\n\nwhether respondents in fact had good cause to act.

But the Court has seen fit to preclude further\nproceedings. I therefore explain why, if final adjudication by this Court\nis indeed appropriate, New Haven should be the prevailing party.\n   11 This alone would have posed a substantial problem for New Haven\n\nin a disparate-impact suit, particularly in light of the disparate results\nthe City’s scheme had produced in the past.

These qualities are not well measured by written\ntests.

That\nfigure represented a marked increase over the previous\ndecade, see ibid., so the percentage today may well be even\nhigher. Among municipalities still relying in part on\nwritten exams, the median weight assigned to them was\n30 percent—half the weight given to New Haven’s written\nexam. Id., at 309.\n   Testimony before the CSB indicated that these alterna\ntive methods were both more reliable and notably less\ndiscriminatory in operation. According to Donald Day of\nthe International Association of Black Professional Fire\nfighters, nearby Bridgeport saw less skewed results after\nswitching to a selection process that placed primary\nweight on an oral exam.

The Court’s specific argu\nments are unavailing.       First, the Court suggests, changing the\noral/written weighting may have violated Title VII’s prohibition on\naltering test scores. Ante, at 31. No one is arguing, however, that the\nresults of the exams given should have been altered. Rather, the\nargument is that the City could have availed itself of a better option\nwhen it initially decided what selection process to use.

A reasonable jury, he maintains, could\nhave found that respondents were not actually motivated\nby concern about disparate-impact litigation, but instead\nsought only “to placate a politically important [African-\nAmerican] constituency.” Ante, at 3. As earlier noted, I\nwould not oppose a remand for further proceedings fair to\nboth sides. See supra, at 26, n. 10. It is the Court that\nhas chosen to short-circuit this litigation based on its\npretension that the City has shown, and can show, noth\ning more than a statistical disparity. See supra, at 24,\nn. 8, 25. JUSTICE ALITO compounds the Court’s error.\n  Offering a truncated synopsis of the many hours of\ndeliberations undertaken by the CSB, JUSTICE ALITO finds\nevidence suggesting that respondents’ stated desire to\ncomply with Title VII was insincere, a mere “pretext” for\ndiscrimination against white firefighters. Ante, at 2–3. In\nsupport of his assertion, JUSTICE ALITO recounts at length\nthe alleged machinations of Rev. Boise Kimber (a local\npolitical activist), Mayor John DeStefano, and certain\nmembers of the mayor’s staff. See ante, at 3–10.\n  Most of the allegations JUSTICE ALITO repeats are\ndrawn from petitioners’ statement of facts they deem\nundisputed, a statement displaying an adversarial zeal\nnot uncommonly found in such presentations.17 What\n——————\n  17 Some  of petitioners’ so-called facts find little support in the record,\nand many others can scarcely be deemed material. Petitioners allege,\nfor example, that City officials prevented New Haven’s fire chief and\nassistant chief from sharing their views about the exams with the CSB.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 228a. None of the materials\npetitioners cite, however, “suggests” that this proposition is accurate.\nCf. ante, at 5.

DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncannot credibly be denied, however, is that the decision\nagainst certification of the exams was made neither by\nKimber nor by the mayor and his staff. The relevant\ndecision was made by the CSB, an unelected, politically\ninsulated body. It is striking that JUSTICE ALITO’s concur\nrence says hardly a word about the CSB itself, perhaps\nbecause there is scant evidence that its motivation was\nanything other than to comply with Title VII’s disparate\nimpact provision. Notably, petitioners did not even seek to\ntake depositions of the two commissioners who voted\nagainst certification. Both submitted uncontested affida\nvits declaring unequivocally that their votes were “based\nsolely on [their] good faith belief that certification” would\nhave discriminated against minority candidates in viola\ntion of federal law. CA2 App. A1605, A1611.\n   JUSTICE ALITO discounts these sworn statements, sug\ngesting that the CSB’s deliberations were tainted by the\npreferences of Kimber and City officials, whether or not\nthe CSB itself was aware of the taint. Kimber and City\nofficials, JUSTICE ALITO speculates, decided early on to\noppose certification and then “engineered” a skewed pres\nentation to the CSB to achieve their preferred outcome.\nAnte, at 12.\n—————— \n\nand assistant chief not to appear.

Moreover, contrary to the insinuations of petitioners and\nJUSTICE ALITO, the statements made by City officials before the CSB did\nnot emphasize allegations of cheating by test takers. Cf. ante, at 7–8.\nIn her deposition, Dubois-Walton acknowledged sharing the cheating\nallegations not with the CSB, but with a different City commission.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 837a. JUSTICE ALITO also\nreports that the City’s attorney advised the mayor’s team that the way\nto convince the CSB not to certify was “to focus on something other\nthan ‘a big discussion re: adverse impact’ law.” Ante, at 8 (quoting App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1428, p. 458a). This is a misleading abbre\nviation of the attorney’s advice. Focusing on the exams’ defects and on\ndisparate-impact law is precisely what he recommended.

The CSB, the record reveals,\ndesigned and conducted an inclusive decisionmaking\nprocess, in which it heard from numerous individuals on\nboth sides of the certification question. See, e.g., CA2 App.\nA1090. Kimber and others no doubt used strong words to\nurge the CSB not to certify the exam results, but the CSB\nreceived “pressure” from supporters of certification as well\nas opponents. Cf. ante, at 6. Petitioners, for example,\nengaged counsel to speak on their behalf before the CSB.\nTheir counsel did not mince words: “[I]f you discard these\nresults,” she warned, “you will get sued. You will force the\ntaxpayers of the city of New Haven into protracted litiga\ntion.” CA2 App. A816. See also id., at A788.\n   The local firefighters union—an organization required\nby law to represent all the City’s firefighters—was simi\nlarly outspoken in favor of certification. Discarding the\ntest results, the union’s president told the CSB, would be\n“totally ridiculous.” Id., at A806. He insisted, inaccu\nrately, that the City was not at risk of disparate-impact\nliability because the exams were administered pursuant to\n“a collective bargaining agreement.” Id., at A1137. Cf.\nsupra, at 26–27, n. 11. Never mentioned by JUSTICE\nALITO in his attempt to show testing expert Christopher\nHornick’s alliance with the City, ante, at 8–9, the CSB\nsolicited Hornick’s testimony at the union’s suggestion, not\nthe City’s. CA2 App. A1128. Hornick’s cogent testimony\nraised substantial doubts about the exams’ reliability. See\nsupra, at 8–10.18\n——————\n  18 City officials, JUSTICE ALITO reports, sent Hornick newspaper ac\n\ncounts and other material about the exams prior to his testimony.\nAnte, at 8. Some of these materials, JUSTICE ALITO intimates, may have\ngiven Hornick an inaccurate portrait of the exams. But Hornick’s\ntestimony before the CSB, viewed in full, indicates that Hornick had an\naccurate understanding of the exam process. Much of Hornick’s analy\nsis focused on the 60/40 weighting of the written and oral exams,\n\f36                      RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  There is scant cause to suspect that maneuvering or\noverheated rhetoric, from either side, prevented the CSB\nfrom evenhandedly assessing the reliability of the exams\nand rendering an independent, good-faith decision on\ncertification. JUSTICE ALITO acknowledges that the CSB\nhad little patience for Kimber’s antics. Ante, at 6–7.19 As\nto petitioners, Chairman Segaloff—who voted to certify\nthe exam results—dismissed the threats made by their\ncounsel as unhelpful and needlessly “inflammatory.” CA2\nApp. A821. Regarding the views expressed by City offi\ncials, the CSB made clear that they were entitled to no\nspecial weight. Id., at A1080.20\n  In any event, JUSTICE ALITO’s analysis contains a more\nfundamental flaw: It equates political considerations with\nunlawful discrimination. As JUSTICE ALITO sees it, if the\nmayor and his staff were motivated by their desire “to\nplacate a . . . racial constituency,” ante, at 3, then they\nengaged in unlawful discrimination against petitioners.\nBut JUSTICE ALITO fails to ask a vital question: “[P]lacate”\nhow? That political officials would have politics in mind is\nhardly extraordinary, and there are many ways in which a\npolitician can attempt to win over a constituency—\n——————\nsomething that neither the Court nor the concurrences even attempt to\ndefend. It is, moreover, entirely misleading to say that the City later\nhired union-proposed Hornick as a “rewar[d]” for his testimony. Cf.\nAnte, at 9.\n   19 To be clear, the Board of Fire Commissioners on which Kimber\n\nserved is an entity separate from the CSB. Kimber was not a member\nof the CSB. Kimber, JUSTICE ALITO states, requested a private meeting\nwith the CSB. Ante, at 6. There is not a shred of evidence that a\nprivate meeting with Kimber or anyone else took place.\n   20 JUSTICE ALITO points to evidence that the mayor had decided not to\n\nmake promotions based on the exams even if the CSB voted to certify\nthe results, going so far as to prepare a press release to that effect.\nAnte, at 9. If anything, this evidence reinforces the conclusion that the\nCSB—which made the noncertification decision—remained independ\nent and above the political fray. The mayor and his staff needed a\ncontingency plan precisely because they did not control the CSB.\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

Were they seeking to exclude white fire\nfighters from promotion (unlikely, as a fair test would\nundoubtedly result in the addition of white firefighters to\nthe officer ranks), or did they realize, at least belatedly,\nthat their tests could be toppled in a disparate-impact\nsuit? In the latter case, there is no disparate-treatment\nviolation. JUSTICE ALITO, I recognize, would disagree. In\nhis view, an employer’s action to avoid Title VII disparate\nimpact liability qualifies as a presumptively improper\nrace-based employment decision. See ante, at 2. I reject\nthat construction of Title VII. See supra, at 18–20. As I\nsee it, when employers endeavor to avoid exposure to\ndisparate-impact liability, they do not thereby encounter\nliability for disparate treatment.\n   Applying this understanding of Title VII, supported by\nGriggs and the long line of decisions following Griggs, see\nsupra, at 16–17, and nn. 3–4, the District Court found no\ngenuine dispute of material fact. That court noted, par\nticularly, the guidance furnished by Second Circuit prece\ndent. See supra, at 12. Petitioners’ allegations that City\nofficials took account of politics, the District Court deter\nmined, simply “d[id] not suffice” to create an inference of\nunlawful discrimination. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 160, n. 12.\nThe noncertification decision, even if undertaken “in a\npolitical context,” reflected a legitimate “intent not to\nimplement a promotional process based on testing results\nthat had an adverse impact.” Id., at 158, 160. Indeed, the\n\f38                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court perceived “a total absence of any evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus towards [petitioners].” Id., at 158.\nSee also id., at 162 (“Nothing in the record in this case\nsuggests that the City defendants or CSB acted ‘because\nof’ discriminatory animus toward [petitioners] or other\nnon-minority applicants for promotion.”). Perhaps the\nDistrict Court could have been more expansive in its\ndiscussion of these issues, but its conclusions appear\nentirely consistent with the record before it.21\n   It is indeed regrettable that the City’s noncertification\ndecision would have required all candidates to go through\nanother selection process. But it would have been more\nregrettable to rely on flawed exams to shut out candidates\nwho may well have the command presence and other\nqualities needed to excel as fire officers. Yet that is the\nchoice the Court makes today. It is a choice that breaks\nthe promise of Griggs that groups long denied equal oppor\ntunity would not be held back by tests “fair in form, but\ndiscriminatory in operation.” 401 U. S., at 431.\n——————\n   21 The District Court, JUSTICE ALITO writes, “all but conceded that a\n\njury could find that the City’s asserted justification was pretextual” by\n“admitt[ing] that ‘a jury could rationally infer that city officials worked\nbehind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because\nthey knew that, were the exams certified, the Mayor would incur the\nwrath of [Rev. Boise] Kimber and other influential leaders of New\nHaven’s African-American community.’ ” Ante, at 3, 13 (quoting 554 F.\nSupp. 2d, at 162). The District Court drew the quoted passage from\npetitioners’ lower court brief, and used it in reference to a First Amend\nment claim not before this Court. In any event, it is not apparent why\nthese alleged political maneuvers suggest an intent to discriminate\nagainst petitioners. That City officials may have wanted to please\npolitical supporters is entirely consistent with their stated desire to\navoid a disparate-impact violation. Cf. Ashcroft v.
