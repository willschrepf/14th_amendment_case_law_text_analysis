HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n\n     This case presents claims under Title VII of retaliation and\n\nsexual harassment by a member of the same sex. A professor at the\n\nUniversity of Texas Houston Health Science Center filed suit,\n\nalleging that he was harassed by his supervisor. He also claimed\n\nthat the University retaliated against him for lodging complaints\n\n     *\n      District Judge of the Eastern District of Louisiana, sitting\nby designation.\n\fwith the University and the EEOC. Following a jury trial, the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment for the plaintiff on these claims,\n\nawarding compensatory damages, back pay, front pay, attorney's\n\nfees, and costs.\n\n      The University challenges the court's denial of its motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, asserting error on an array of legal\n\nand   factual    grounds.     The   University   argues   that   the   jury's\n\nretaliation verdict was not supported by an adverse employment\n\naction and lacked an adequate basis in fact; that the alleged acts\n\nof harassment were not sufficiently severe or pervasive; that the\n\njury erred in finding that the University had not established its\n\naffirmative defenses to the harassment claim; and that the court's\n\naward of front pay, attorney's fees, and costs was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     We   affirm   the   court's   judgment    in   virtually   all\n\nrespects, vacating only a portion of its award of costs.\n\n\n\n                                       I\n\n      Dr. Luis F. Mota, a resident alien from Caracas, began work in\n\n1993 as a visiting professor in the Department of Periodontics at\n\nthe Dental Branch of the University of Texas Houston Health Science\n\nCenter.1 He began his first year as a tenure-track professor with\n\nthe University in 1995. At all relevant times, Dr. Raul Caffesse\n\nwas the head of the Periodontics Department at the Dental Branch.\n\n      1\n      The University is a state educational system. See Tex. Educ.\nCode §§ 65.02(a)(9) (Vernon's 2001).\n\n                                       2\n\f       Caffesse and Mota knew each other prior to Mota's term at the\n\nUniversity. Mota's parents, who were also periodontists, knew\n\nCaffesse and would receive him into their home on social visits.\n\nLikewise,    Caffesse    would   entertain   Mota's   parents   when    they\n\ntraveled to the United States. After Mota moved to Houston, he\n\ncontinued this social relationship with Caffesse and Caffesse's\n\nfamily.\n\n       Caffesse's stature as a renowned periodontist prompted Mota to\n\napply for a position at the University. Caffesse, who had an\n\nendowed professorship named after him at the Dental School, was\n\nconsidered to be among the ten most famous academic periodontists\n\nin the world.\n\n       In June 1996 Mota and Caffesse participated in a three-day\n\nconference in Monterrey, Mexico. The event was jointly sponsored by\n\nthe Dental School and the University of Nuevo Laredo. Although Mota\n\nwas not originally scheduled to attend, Caffesse told Mota several\n\ndays    before   the    trip   that   he   should   accompany   him    as   a\n\nrepresentative of the Dental School. Caffesse arranged for them to\n\nshare the same hotel room.\n\n       Mota later testified that Caffesse engaged in unwanted and\n\noffensive sexual conduct toward him while they were in the hotel\n\nroom. During their time in Mexico, Caffesse allegedly told Mota\n\nthat he had to \"get along with him and that people who worked with\n\nhim had to get along with [him] and that he only wanted to know\n\n[Mota] better.\" Caffesse also suggested that Mota's immigration\n\n                                      3\n\fstatus   could     be   jeopardized   if   he     no    longer   worked    at   the\n\nUniversity.\n\n     Following the trip to Monterrey, Caffesse promised Mota that\n\nthe incidents which occurred in Mexico would not happen again. He\n\nalso told Mota that he had arranged for him to give a presentation\n\nat another seminar and that Mota would receive a $500 honorarium.\n\nMota asserts that he took the honorarium money and purchased a\n\npresent for Caffesse in excess of the $500. According to Mota, the\n\ngift was motivated by his desire not to be indebted to Caffesse.\n\n     Despite       Caffesse's     assurances,     incidents      of     harassment\n\nallegedly continued. Mota later testified that Caffesse engaged in\n\nunwanted and offensive sexual advances at conferences he attended\n\nin Philadelphia, Breckenridge, and Orlando. Caffesse also allegedly\n\nengaged in other acts of sexual harassment while he and Mota were\n\nin Houston. In the face of Caffesse's advances, Mota canceled\n\nconference engagements which he knew Caffesse would also attend.\n\n     The     record     also    supports   the     inference     that     Caffesse\n\nthreatened Mota. During one conference, Mota refused to room with\n\nCaffesse. Caffesse angrily raised his hand in the air and told Mota\n\nthat he could not do that to him and could not work in the\n\ndepartment    if    Mota   kept   rejecting      him.   On   another    occasion,\n\nCaffesse allegedly told Mota that the University would defend\n\nCaffesse—as it allegedly had in the past—in any type of complaint\n\nbrought against him. Caffesse further informed Mota that Caffesse\n\ndisliked certain persons at the school, and that he had \"helped\n\n                                       4\n\fthem to leave\" the school. He regularly admonished Mota not to tell\n\nanyone of his advances.\n\n      On April 23, 1997, Mota submitted a detailed, written sexual\n\nharassment complaint against Caffesse to the University. According\n\nto Mota, he and a member of the Sexual Harassment Board had agreed\n\nthat the investigatory panel would not include persons who had past\n\ndealings with Caffesse or who were associated with the Dental or\n\nMedical schools. Prof. George Stancel was appointed chairman of the\n\nthree-member panel. Stancel was a medical school professor who\n\napparently had worked closely with the spouse of a professor who\n\nworked regularly with Caffesse. Stancel later testified that he was\n\naware of Caffesse's stature at the Dental School and that he had\n\nmet him on at least one occasion.\n\n      The members of the panel concluded that they were unable to\n\ndetermine whether or not Caffesse had violated the University's\n\nsexual   harassment   policy.    During    the    investigation,     Caffesse\n\nadmitted to the panel that he had sexually propositioned Mota on\n\ntwo   trips   following   the   Mexico    trip.   Another   member    of   the\n\nUniversity testified before the panel that \"if you cross Caffesse,\n\nyou are definitely in trouble. In other words, if you tell him 'no'\n\nyou better watch out.\"\n\n      Although Mota had recorded conversations with Caffesse, he did\n\nnot submit these to the panel. The panel never asked for such\n\nevidence; nor was the panel aware of its existence. Mota later\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\fplayed the tapes to the jury in the trial before the district\n\ncourt.\n\n      Upon       issuing     its   decision,     the   panel    notified     Mota   and\n\nsuggested     that,     if    he   had   new     evidence,     he   could    request   a\n\nreopening of his case. Despite the evidence contained on the tapes,\n\nMota did not ask the panel to reopen the case. Four days after the\n\ndecision, Mota requested \"protection against further harassment and\n\nretaliation\" by Caffesse. In response, Caffesse told the Dean of\n\nthe Dental School, Dr. Ronald Johnson, that he was willing to work\n\nout   an   arrangement        acceptable        to   Mota,   under   which    the    two\n\nprofessors could continue working in the Periodontics Department.\n\n      Dean Johnson did not learn of Mota's University complaint\n\nuntil July 16, 1997, when Mota sent him a courtesy copy of a\n\ncomplaint he had filed with the EEOC.2 University policy prohibits\n\nthe panel from notifying the appropriate administrative authority\n\nin the University that a complaint has been filed. According to M.\n\nDavid     Low,    the   University       president,     Johnson      was    the   person\n\nresponsible for protecting Mota from retaliation.\n\n      In a meeting with Caffesse and Mota on July 23, 1997, Dean\n\nJohnson asked Mota to write a memo describing parameters under\n\nwhich he would feel comfortable working in the Department. When\n\nMota declined to do so, Johnson instructed Caffesse to draft the\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          Mota filed a complaint with the EEOC on July 14, 1997.\n\n                                            6\n\fdocument. The next day, Caffesse sent Mota a letter outlining\n\nguidelines.\n\n      In response to the charges of retaliation contained in Mota's\n\nEEOC complaint, the University hired an outside attorney to conduct\n\nan   investigation.   The   University    contends   that   Mota      did   not\n\ncooperate with the attorney, whose April 9, 1998 report concluded\n\nthat no retaliation had occurred.\n\n      Mota   does   not   allege   that   any   further   acts   of    sexual\n\nharassment occurred after the filing of his April 1997 complaint.\n\nHe contends, however, that the University retaliated against him.\n\nFirst, he asserts that, in the wake of his complaint, Caffesse\n\narranged Mota's schedule so as to bring them into constant contact.\n\nMota alleges that Caffesse made this scheduling decision in the\n\nface of Mota's objections. When Caffesse relented and changed\n\nMota's schedule, he reassigned him from some of the desirable\n\ngraduate clinics to the less prestigious undergraduate clinics.\n\n      On August 20, 1997, Johnson and Low denied Mota a $2,500\n\nstipend for serving as the Dental School clinical coordinator. Mota\n\nhad been the clinical coordinator since late 1995. However, the\n\nUniversity contends that Mota had not performed the duties of\n\nclinical coordinator since September 1996. The University argues\n\nthat the discontinuation of Mota's stipend resulted from an inquiry\n\nsent by Mota to Johnson, in which Mota stated that he continued to\n\nreceive supplemental pay for the clinical coordinator position.\n\nJohnson testified that he stopped payment simply to correct an\n\n                                     7\n\fadministrative oversight, as the University would not pay someone\n\nwho was not doing the work required by the position.\n\n     On September 10, 1997, the University denied Mota's request\n\nfor a paid six-month leave of absence. President Low denied Mota's\n\nrequest, yet authorized six months of unpaid leave beginning\n\nNovember 3, 1997.3 Mota was to return to work on May 1, 1998.\n\n     While Mota was on leave, he began looking for another job and\n\nvisited his parents in Venezuela several times. He also requested\n\nthat the University grant him access to his office, a microscope,\n\nand the library to allow him to conduct research while on leave.\n\nJohnson refused these requests, denying him access to a microscope\n\nand preventing him from entering his office. Johnson further\n\nordered Mota's name removed from the University letterhead and from\n\nhis office. He prevented Mota from serving on mock oral boards and\n\nthesis committees. He also refused to allow him to teach a seminar\n\nin Spain, through which Mota could have earned $2,000. Mota also\n\nalleges that Johnson and other University professors ostracized\n\nhim, warning students not to associate with him. Johnson allegedly\n\ntold one graduate student that if he ever caught the student in\n\ncontact with   Mota,   the   University   would   disqualify   him   as a\n\nstudent.\n\n\n\n     3\n       During the first twelve weeks of leave, Mota apparently\nreceived benefits    through the Family and Medical Leave Act.\nJohnson described the balance of Mota's leave period as\n\"administrative leave.\"\n\n                                   8\n\f      In an undated letter, Mota requested an additional six months\n\nof unpaid personal leave. Low and Johnson refused the requested\n\nextension, informing Mota that they would consider his failure to\n\nresume work after May 26, 1998 to be a resignation from the\n\nfaculty. This letter denied the extension ostensibly because Mota\n\ngave no reasons for the request. In his letter, Mota had cited his\n\nhope for a \"mutually beneficial resolution.\" Low and Johnson stated\n\nthat an extension would not facilitate this objective and would not\n\nbe in the best interests of either Mota or the University. When\n\nMota did not return to work on May 26, 1998, the University\n\nterminated him. Three months later, Mota accepted a lower-paying\n\nposition with the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n      On April 30, 1998, Mota filed suit against the University in\n\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of\n\nTexas,     alleging     sexual    harassment       and   retaliation.    Mota\n\nsubsequently amended his complaint to add a claim against Caffesse,\n\nin   his   individual    capacity,    for    defamation    and     intentional\n\ninfliction    of   emotional     distress.   The   trial   judge   ultimately\n\ndismissed the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n\nAfter Caffesse and Mota entered into a settlement agreement for\n\n$290,000, the court then dismissed all remaining claims against\n\nCaffesse.\n\n      Following a six-day trial, a jury returned a verdict against\n\nthe University. The jury found that Mota had been subjected to\n\nunlawful sexual harassment; that the harassment did not result in\n\n                                      9\n\fa tangible employment action against Mota; that the University\n\nfailed to exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct\n\nharassing behavior towards Mota; that Mota did not unreasonably\n\nfail to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities\n\nmade       available   by   the   University;       and    that   the   University\n\nretaliated       against    Mota.    The     jury     awarded      $15,000.00     in\n\ncompensatory damages, $104,435.00 in back pay, and delivered an\n\nadvisory verdict of $328,565.00 in front pay.\n\n       In an order dated December 8, 1999, Judge Gilmore awarded\n\n$388,367.51 to Mota for attorney's fees and expenses. The court\n\nalso awarded the judgment amount plus interest for compensatory\n\ndamages and back pay, yet reduced the jury's recommended front pay\n\nto   $194,989.00.      On   December   20,    1999,       the   court   denied   the\n\nUniversity's motion for judgment as a matter law and to amend the\n\njudgment. The University appeals this ruling and the December 8\n\nfinal judgment.\n\n\n\n                                       II\n\n       The University contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on Mota's Title\n\nVII retaliation claim. This Court reviews the denial of a motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law de novo, according to the same\n\nstandard applied by the district court.4 Judgment as a matter of\n\n       4\n           See Stokes v. Emerson Elec. Co., 217 F.3d 353, 356 (5th Cir.\n2000).\n\n                                       10\n\flaw is warranted if, after viewing the record in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party, there is no \"legally sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis\" for a reasonable jury to have found for the\n\nprevailing    party.5   \"[T]he      court   should    give     credence     to   the\n\nevidence    favoring    the    nonmovant     as    well   as    that   'evidence\n\nsupporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,\n\nat least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested\n\nwitnesses.'\"6\n\n     To state a claim for retaliation, a plaintiff must establish\n\nthat: (1) he engaged in protected activity, as described in Title\n\nVII; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal\n\nnexus    exists    between    the   protected     activity     and   the   adverse\n\nemployment action.7 \"Protected activity\" is defined as opposition\n\nto any practice rendered unlawful by Title VII, including making a\n\ncharge,     testifying,       assisting,     or      participating         in    any\n\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.8 \"Adverse\n\nemployment actions\" include only \"ultimate employment decisions .\n\n\n     5\n         See id.\n     6\n       Reeves v.

Although the jury\n\nfound that Mota was subjected to sexual harassment, it determined\n\nthat the sexual harassment did not result in a \"tangible employment\n\naction.\" The Supreme Court has defined \"tangible employment action\"\n\nas \"a significant change in employment status, such as hiring,\n\n\n     9\n       Walker v.

The\n\nUniversity points to the similarity between the type of actions\n\nencompassed by the two categories. It contends that the jury's\n\nfinding of no tangible employment action precludes the existence of\n\nan adverse employment action for purposes of Mota's retaliation\n\nclaim.\n\n     This argument is without merit. The jury was given a separate\n\ninstruction for retaliation, in which the court noted that an\n\n     13\n          Burlington Indus., Inc. v.

Such an action in most cases inflicts\n     direct economic harm. Tangible employment actions are the\n     means by which the supervisor brings the official power\n     of the enterprise to bear on subordinates, and require an\n     official act of the company.\n\n                                     13\n\fadverse employment action was required. The court's explanation of\n\nadverse employment action was similar to its previous definition of\n\ntangible employment action.16 In finding that the University had\n\nretaliated against Mota, however, the jury implicitly found that an\n\nadverse employment action had been taken. Moreover, the relevant\n\nemployment action resulting from sexual harassment, as opposed to\n\nretaliation,   may   differ.   Retaliation     occurs   in     response    to\n\nprotected activity, whereas a tangible employment action is the\n\nresult of   the   harassment   itself.   A   rational   jury    could     have\n\nconcluded both that no tangible employment action resulted from the\n\nharassment and that the University subsequently retaliated against\n\nMota for filing a complaint.\n\n\n\n                                   B\n\n     The University next argues that many of the actions asserted\n\nby Mota do not rise to the level of \"adverse employment actions.\"\n\nMota contends that the following events were causally linked to the\n\nfiling of his complaints with the University and the EEOC: (1) the\n\nUniversity placed Caffesse in charge of monitoring any further\n\nharassment; (2) Mota was ostracized by faculty and students; (3) he\n\nwas barred from entering the Dental School; (4) Mota's name was\n\nremoved from his office door and from the University letterhead;\n\n     16\n       The court instructed the jury that \"[a]n adverse employment\naction is a significant change in employment status and includes\ndischarge, demotion, refusal to promote, denial of leave request,\nchange in compensation, or a major change in responsibilities.\"\n\n                                  14\n\f(5) Mota was stripped of his duties as principal investigator on\n\ncertain projects; (6) the University prevented Mota from continuing\n\nto serve on mock oral boards and on thesis committees; (7) the\n\nUniversity refused to allow him to teach seminars in Spain (which\n\nwould have yielded some $2,000); (8) the University ceased paying\n\nMota a $2,500 annual stipend; (9) the University refused to grant\n\nMota paid leave; (10) the University denied his request for an\n\nextension of unpaid leave; and (11) the University treated Mota's\n\nfailure to return by May 26, 1999 as a resignation. Although some\n\nof the preceding events do not qualify as \"ultimate employment\n\ndecisions,\"17 at least four of the actions allegedly taken by the\n\nUniversity meet this definition. Moreover, the evidence regarding\n\nthese events provides ample support for the jury's finding of\n\nretaliation.\n\n\n\n                                  1\n\n     The University's discontinuation of Mota's $2,500 stipend on\n\nAugust 20, 1997 is a compensation decision, thereby qualifying as\n\nan adverse employment action.18 The University characterizes the\n\naction as merely a \"business decision,\"19 contesting the jury's\n\n     17\n        For instance, ostracism by fellow employees does not\nconstitute an \"ultimate employment decision.\" See Mattern v.\nEastman Kodak Co., 104 F.3d 702, 707-08 (5th Cir. 1997).\n     18\n          See Walker v. Thompson, 214 F.3d 615, 629 (5th Cir. 2000).\n     19\n       The University appears to concede that this event would, if\ngiven the interpretation advocated by Mota, constitute an adverse\n\n                                  15\n\finference        of    retaliation.    The      University      argues    that   the\n\n\"undisputed evidence\" reveals that Mota had not been fulfilling the\n\nduties of clinical coordinator since September 1996, when Dr.\n\nWalter E. Dimmitt allegedly assumed Mota's position. However, Mota\n\ntestified that Dimmitt was given the separate position of \"clinical\n\ndirector,\" not \"clinical coordinator.\" Mota testified that he\n\ncontinued to serve as clinical coordinator until Dean Johnson and\n\nPresident Low removed him from this position on August 20, 1997.\n\nThe record also contains a letter, dated August 29, 1997, in which\n\nMota denies having relinquished these duties. A rational jury could\n\ninfer     from    this    evidence    that      the   University's   reasons     for\n\ndiscontinuing Mota's stipend were pretextual.\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\n     The University also argues that its denial of Mota's request\n\nfor paid leave was not causally linked to his sexual harassment\n\ncomplaint.20      As    the   University     observes,    the    record   does   not\n\nindicate that a similarly situated employee was denied six months\n\nof paid leave. The University implies that the causal link between\n\nMota's protected activity and the denial of his paid leave request\n\nis consequently too tenuous to support a jury finding. However,\n\n\n\nemployment action.\n     20\n       The University implicitly concedes that the denial of paid\nleave constitutes an adverse employment action. See Walker, 214\nF.3d at 629.\n\n                                           16\n\fwhile the fact that no similarly situated faculty member was denied\n\npaid leave may cast doubt on Mota's retaliation claim,21 it is not\n\ndispositive.\n\n     A rational jury could have found that the University's denial\n\nof paid leave was causally related to Mota's protected activity.\n\nThe University's Handbook of Operating Procedures stated that paid\n\nleave could be granted \"for a wide variety of reasons.\" A jury\n\ncould     conclude   that   the   University   refused   to   exercise   its\n\ndiscretion to grant Mota paid leave. The University asserts that\n\nMota was ineligible for paid leave, arguing that he had exhausted\n\nall accrued paid sick and annual leave prior to November 1997. The\n\nUniversity's position is not compelled by the record, and a jury\n\ncould have determined that the proffered reason for denying Mota\n\npaid leave was pretextual. Indeed, the jury's finding that the\n\nUniversity had already retaliated against Mota by discontinuing his\n\nstipend further supports an inference of retaliatory animus in the\n\npaid leave context.\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\n     The University also asserts that its denial of Mota's request\n\nfor an extension of his unpaid leave can not support a retaliation\n\nclaim. \"[E]mployment actions are not adverse where pay, benefits,\n\n\n\n     21\n       See Swanson v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 110 F.3d 1180, 1185-86\n(5th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                      17\n\fand level of responsibility remain the same.\"22 The University\n\ncontends that denial of unpaid—as opposed to paid—leave can not be\n\nan adverse employment action because it does not deprive Mota of\n\npay, benefits, or level of responsibility.\n\n     The University's contention is without merit. Unpaid leave\n\nfacially qualifies as a benefit. This Court has recognized that the\n\ngranting of leave, more generally, is an \"ultimate employment\n\ndecision.\"23 This Court has not differentiated between paid and\n\nunpaid leave. Moreover, it is difficult to conceive of a principled\n\nbasis     for   such   a   distinction.24   The   University's   argument\n\nconsequently fails.25\n\n     A rational jury could conclude that the University retaliated\n\nagainst Mota by denying his request for additional unpaid leave.\n\nAlthough the University asserts that Mota was granted medical\n\n\n\n     22\n          Watts v. Kroger Co., 170 F.3d 505, 512 (5th Cir. 1999).\n     23\n          See Walker, 214 F.3d at 629.\n     24\n       Cf. Rowe v. Laidlaw Transit, Inc., 244 F.3d 1115, 1118 (9th\nCir. 2001) (finding no basis for distinguishing between paid and\nunpaid leave for purposes of the FMLA and that such a distinction\nwould frustrate the statute's purpose of protecting employees from\nadverse employment decisions).\n     25\n       The cases cited by the University are inapposite. Ansonia\nBd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 70-71 (1986), is a\nreligious accommodation case. Moreover, Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty,\n434 U.S. 136, 145 (1977), was superseded by the 1978 amendments to\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. See Pub. L. No. 95-555, 92 Stat. 2076\n(1979) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k)); Somers v.\nAldine Indep. Sch. Dist., 464 F. Supp. 900, 902-03 (S.D. Tex.\n1979).\n\n                                     18\n\fleave, Mota testified that he was granted \"personal leave,\" which\n\nmay be granted for up to twelve months. The record indicates that\n\nanother University employee was granted one year of unpaid personal\n\nleave because his wife did not like the weather in Houston. In the\n\nface    of    an   arguably   more   compelling   rationale—i.e.,      Mota's\n\ndifficulties with Caffesse and his medical problems26—the University\n\nrefused Mota's request for the same amount of unpaid leave. The\n\nUniversity informed Mota that the grant of additional leave was not\n\nin the best interests of the University. It argued at trial that\n\nMota had failed to provide a \"legitimate, documented reason for an\n\nextension of his leave.\" The University further asserted that Mota\n\nhad already accepted a position with the University of Pittsburgh\n\nat the time of his request.\n\n       A    jury   could   have   disbelieved   each   of   these   proffered\n\njustifications, concluding that the University's explanation for\n\nrefusing Mota's request was a pretext for retaliation. First, Mota\n\ntestified at trial that no documentation beyond that which he had\n\nalready supplied the University was necessary. A jury could have\n\ncredited this assertion. Second, Mota asserts that he had not yet\n\naccepted a position in Pittsburgh at the time of the denial of his\n\nrequest for leave. Indeed, the record contains a letter from the\n\nProvost of the University of Pittsburgh, dated August 19, 1998,\n\n\n       26\n       According to Mota's doctors and his own testimony, Mota\nexperienced an array of psychological and minor medical problems in\nthe wake of the incidents involving Caffesse.\n\n                                       19\n\fwhich indicates the formal approval of Mota's appointment as\n\nVisiting Assistant Professor of Periodontics. The jury could have\n\nreasonably inferred from this evidence that Mota had not accepted\n\nthe offer by May 19, 1998, when the University denied his request\n\nfor additional leave.27 The evidence supports a jury finding of\n\nretaliation.\n\n\n\n                                4\n\n     A rational jury also could have determined that the University\n\nultimately terminated Mota because of his involvement in protected\n\nactivity. Although the University asserts that Mota resigned, a\n\njury could have found that it terminated him. In fact, Mota\n\nsubmitted a letter dated June 26, 1998, in which he contests\n\nJohnson's assertion that he had resigned.\n\n     The record supports the inference that Mota's termination was\n\nmotivated by retaliatory animus. Mota's ostracism at the hands of\n\nUniversity employees and the University's decision to strip of him\n\nof certain duties and privileges support a finding of retaliatory\n\nanimus. This conclusion is strengthened by a finding that the\n\nUniversity retaliated against Mota by discontinuing his stipend and\n\ndenying his leave requests.    We therefore find no error in the\n\n\n     27\n        A jury also could have concluded that the University\nintended to create immigration difficulties for Mota, as his visa\nwas set to expire on July 14, 1998. Given the impending expiration\nof Mota's visa, a jury could have inferred that the University's\ndenial of additional leave was motivated by retaliatory animus.\n\n                                20\n\fdistrict court's refusal to enter judgment as a matter of law on\n\nMota's retaliation claim.\n\n\n\n                                       III\n\n                                        A\n\n      The University contends that the trial court erred in entering\n\njudgment on Mota's sexual harassment claim. The University argues,\n\nfirst, that Caffesse's harassment of Mota was not sufficiently\n\nsevere or pervasive.28 The plaintiff in a hostile work environment\n\nclaim must establish that: (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2)\n\nwas subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment\n\nwas   based    on   his   sex;   (4)   the   harassment   affected   a   term,\n\ncondition, or privilege of his employment; and (5) the employer\n\nknew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take\n\nremedial action.29 A hostile work environment claim requires the\n\npresence of a work environment that a reasonable person would find\n\nhostile or abusive.30 \"Whether an environment is hostile or abusive\n\ndepends on a totality of circumstances, focusing on factors such as\n\nthe frequency of the conduct, the severity of the conduct, the\n\n\n      28\n       The University does not contest the proposition that Title\nVII prohibits same-sex harassment. The Supreme Court conclusively\nresolved this issue in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,\n523 U.S. 75 (1998).\n      29\n           Cain v. Blackwell, 246 F.3d 758, 760 (5th Cir. 2001).\n      30\n       See DeAngelis v. El Paso Mun. Police Officers Ass'n, 51 F.3d\n591, 594 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                       21\n\fdegree    to   which    the     conduct        is   physically    threatening    or\n\nhumiliating, and the degree to which the conduct unreasonably\n\ninterferes with an employee's work performance.\"31                  This Court has\n\nheld that \"[d]iscriminatory verbal intimidation, ridicule, and\n\ninsults may be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the\n\nconditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment that violates Title VII.\"32\n\n     A jury could rationally infer that Caffesse's conduct was\n\nsufficiently extreme as to create a hostile work environment. The\n\nevidence supports a finding that Caffesse engaged in repeated,\n\naggressive sexual advances in the face of adamant refusals by Mota.\n\nA jury could find this conduct to be humiliating and degrading,\n\nparticularly in conjunction with Caffesse's threats. Although much\n\nof this conduct was verbal, there was also evidence of repeated\n\nphysical contact. Moreover, the record reflects that Mota suffered\n\nemotional distress and psychological problems in the wake of the\n\nharassment.    Although       there     is      little   evidence    that     Mota's\n\nperformance as a teacher and researcher suffered at the time of the\n\nharassment,    the     record    does     reflect     that   he   came   to   avoid\n\nengagements and conferences at which Caffesse was also present.33\n\n     31\n       Weller v. Citation Oil & Gas Corp., 84 F.3d 191, 194 (5th\nCir. 1996).\n     32\n          Walker v. Thompson, 214 F.3d 615, 626 (5th Cir. 2000).\n     33\n       Tangible detriment to an employee's work performance is only\none factor to be considered in a hostile work environment claim.\nSee Harris v. Forklift System, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).\n\n                                          22\n\fIndeed, Mota felt compelled to take a leave from his position in\n\nthe wake of Caffesse's actions. There was sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's finding of harassment.\n\n\n\n                                 B\n\n     The University further argues that the trial court lacked\n\njurisdiction to consider Mota's Title VII harassment claims to the\n\nextent that they are based on events occurring in Mexico. The\n\nUniversity essentially contends that federal jurisdiction does not\n\nlie given the extraterritorial events alleged and the fact that\n\nMota is not a U.S. citizen.34\n\n     Assuming   arguendo   the   validity   of   Mota's   Title   VII\n\ninterpretation, subject matter jurisdiction would not be present if\n\nthe events in Mexico were the sole basis for Mota's harassment\n\nclaim.35 However, Mota's claim is also supported by alleged acts of\n\n\n     34\n       Title VII does not govern aliens employed outside the United\nStates. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e(f) (2001) (\"With respect to\nemployment in a foreign country, such term [employee] includes an\nindividual who is a citizen of the United States.\"); 2000e-1(a)\n(\"This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to\nthe employment of aliens outside any State . . . .\"); Espinoza v.\nFarah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 95 (1973); Iwata v. Stryker Corp., 59\nF. Supp. 2d 600, 603 (N.D. Tex. 1999). The University implicitly\nconcedes that Title VII protections apply to an alien employed in\nthe United States. See Espinoza, 414 U.S. at 95. We offer no\nopinion as to whether Mota's participation in a three-day\nconference in Mexico deprives him of Title VII protection.\n     35\n       Cf. Boureslan v. ARAMCO, Arabian Am. Oil Co., 892 F.2d 1271\n(5th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (affirming dismissal of Title VII claim\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction         on the basis of\nextraterritoriality concerns), aff'd, EEOC v.

See\nFed. R. Evid. 401, 403 (2001). We express no opinion as to the\nmerits of such an argument, however, as the University failed to\narticulate this position on appeal. The University has therefore\nwaived any contention on these grounds. See Yohey v. Collins, 985\nF.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n                                   24\n\fcorrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm\n\notherwise.\"38\n\n\n\n                                               1\n\n       A jury could reasonably conclude that the University failed to\n\nexercise       reasonable       care     to        prevent     and    promptly   correct\n\nharassment. The jury could conclude that the panel's failure to\n\ndiscipline Caffesse or take more affirmative steps against him was\n\nunreasonable.       In this case, the University decided to simply let\n\nMota and Caffesse work out a mutually agreeable accommodation.\n\nAlthough an       employer      need     not       use   the   most    serious   sanction\n\navailable to punish an offender,39 the University did not even find\n\nthat Caffesse       had    engaged       in    sexual      harassment.     Nor   did    the\n\nUniversity issue a reprimand or warning, despite its policy against\n\neven        consensual    sexual       relations          between      supervisors      and\n\nsubordinates.       In    the    past,    the       school     had    reprimanded    other\n\nsupervisors       who    had    engaged       in    consensual       relationships     with\n\nsubordinates.40 Finally, the University's retaliation against Mota\n\n\n       38\n       Casiano v. AT&T Corp., 213 F.3d 278, 284 (5th Cir. 2000).\nMota does not appeal the jury's finding that there was no tangible\nemployment action. The University therefore construes his claim as\na \"hostile environment\" action. See id.\n       39\n       See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 968 F.2d 427, 430 (5th\nCir. 1992), aff'd, 511 U.S. 244 (1994).\n       40\n       Cf. Walker v.

The University criticizes Mota for\n\nnot having filed his complaint with the Harassment Board sooner and\n\nfor failing to disclose tapes of conversations with Caffesse.\n\n     This Court has not articulated a bright-line test regarding\n\nwhen a delay in filing a complaint becomes \"unreasonable.\" Mota\n\nfiled his complaint in late April 1997, approximately nine months\n\nafter the incidents in Mexico and eight months after the events in\n\nPhiladelphia. Although this Court's jurisprudence indicates that a\n\ndelay of three months appears not to be excessive,41 a delay of\n\neight or nine months is more problematic. However, in light of\n\nCaffesse's repeated threats of retaliation, a jury could infer that\n\nMota's delay was not unreasonable. Mota may have believed that\n\nresort to the University's administrative process was ineffectual,\n\ngiven Caffesse's influence at the University. According to Mota's\n\ntestimony, Caffesse told him that the University would protect and\n\ndefend him against any complaint. Thus, Mota's delay in filing his\n\ncomplaint does not warrant reversing the jury's determination.\n\n\nbehavior).\n     41\n          See Watts v. Kroger Co., 170 F.3d 505, 510-11 (5th Cir.\n1999).\n\n                                26\n\f       A jury could also find that Mota's failure to disclose tape\n\nrecordings of conversations between him and Caffesse was not\n\nunreasonable.      Mota   fully    participated         in   the   investigation,\n\ntestifying before the panel and providing an extensive written\n\ncomplaint.    He    may   have    viewed    the   production       of   additional\n\nevidence, such as recordings of conversations, as futile, given his\n\nconcerns    over    the   effectiveness     of    the    panel's    inquiry,    the\n\ncomposition of the panel, and Caffesse's influence. A jury could\n\nhave    concluded    that    Mota's   actions      did       not   constitute    an\n\nunreasonable failure to take advantage of preventive or corrective\n\nopportunities.\n\n       In sum, a jury could have determined that the University\n\nfailed to meet its burden of proof in establishing its affirmative\n\ndefenses. The district court did not err in entering judgment on\n\nMota's sexual harassment claim.\n\n\n\n                                       IV\n\n                                       A\n\n       The University contends that the court's award of front pay\n\nwas an abuse of discretion.42 Front pay is a form of equitable\n\nrelief contemplated by Title VII and is intended \"to compensate the\n\n\n\n\n       42\n       See Shirley v. Chrysler First, Inc., 970 F.2d 39, 44 (5th\nCir. 1992) (applying abuse of discretion standard).\n\n                                       27\n\fplaintiff for lost future wages and benefits.\"43 \"[F]ront pay may\n\nbe awarded if reinstatement is not feasible where\" a hostile\n\nrelationship   exists   between   the   employer   and   the   plaintiff.44\n\nAlthough front pay is an equitable remedy for the district court to\n\ndetermine, the court may empanel an advisory jury.45\n\n     In considering the jury's advisory award of $328,565.00 in\n\nfront pay, the district court took into account the University's\n\npost-trial conduct. This was not error.46 After initially reducing\n\n\n     43\n       Id.; see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1) (2001); see also Pollard\nv. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 121 S.

Harris County, 197 F.3d 173, 188 (5th Cir.\n1999); Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402, 423 n.19\n(5th Cir. 1998); Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(c) (2001).\n     46\n        The University implies that the email should have been\nsubjected to the procedural safeguards of an evidentiary hearing.\nAssuming arguendo that the University had a due process right to a\nhearing, it waived that right by failing to ask the court for a\nhearing on the basis of the email. See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401\nU.S. 371, 378-79 (1971). The University had ample notice of the\nbasis for a possible hearing request, as Mota noted the\nimplications of the email in three separate pleadings prior to the\ncourt's entry of final judgment. Although the University moved for\nan evidentiary hearing on equitable relief, it did not argue that\nthe email warranted such a hearing. The University waived any\nputative hearing right. See Bueno v. City of Donna, 714 F.2d 484,\n492-93 (5th Cir. 1983).\n     The University also contends that the message is inadmissible\nhearsay. This argument is meritless. The email was competent\nevidence as either a verbal act, see Fed. R. Evid. 801(a) (2001);\nTompkins v. Cyr, 202 F.3d 770, 779 n.3 (5th Cir. 2000) (stating\nthat a threatening letter was a verbal act, and not a \"statement\"\nfor purposes of the hearsay rule); as evidence of Low's state of\nmind, see Fed. R. Evid. 803(3) (2001); or as evidence of its impact\non Mota, see United States v. Ballis, 28 F.3d 1399, 1405 (5th Cir.\n\n                                   28\n\fthe jury's recommended award to reflect only ten years of lost\n\nfuture wages, the court added five additional years of front pay\n\nbased on an email sent by President Low to all 8,000 University\n\nemployees. The court determined that the email, which Low sent the\n\nday after the jury verdict, was the continuation of a pattern of\n\nvindictive behavior demonstrated at trial. In the email, Low\n\nexpressed   his   disappointment       over   the   jury's   finding   of\n\nretaliation, stating: \"I want to make it very clear that [Mota] was\n\nnot fired, but rather failed to return to his faculty duties upon\n\nexpiration of leave that he had requested and was granted by UT-\n\nHouston.\" The district court portrayed the email as attempting to\n\n\"present Mota in the worst professional light possible.\" The court\n\nalso concluded that this behavior would impact Mota's future work\n\nprospects. On this basis, the court reduced the jury's front pay\n\naward to $194,989.00. We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                   B\n\n     The University also contends that the front pay awarded by the\n\ncourt failed to take into account the fact that, at the time Mota\n\nleft the University in 1998, he would not have been considered for\n\ntenure at the University until he had completed four more years of\n\nwork. It contends that the court gave Mota a windfall by treating\n\n\n\n1994); United States v. Kirk, 844 F.2d 660, 663 (5th Cir. 1988).\nMota did not submit the letter to \"prove the truth of the matter\nasserted\" therein. Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) (2001).\n\n                                   29\n\fhim as if he had tenure by the time he left the University.\n\nHowever, the University does not point to any specific evidence to\n\nrefute the court's calculations. The court attempted to reconcile\n\nthe pay disparity between Mota's position at the University and the\n\nlower-paying position he was forced to take in Pittsburgh. This was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                      C\n\n     The    University    further    challenges    the   court's   award   of\n\nattorney's fees. A district court's award of attorney's fees is\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.47 The University first contends\n\nthat the fee award was excessive in comparison with fee awards\n\nentered in other Title VII cases requiring more time and attention.\n\nThe University fails to address the court's application of the\n\nJohnson factors,48 and makes only a conclusory assertion about\n\ncomparable awards. The two cases cited by the University involve\n\nsubstantially     lower    hour     totals   and   billing    rates.49     The\n\nUniversity's failure to object to specific hours worked and the\n\n\n     47\n          See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983).\n     48\n       See id. at 433-37; Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.,\n488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974).\n     49\n       See Purcell v. Seguin State Bank & Trust Co., 999 F.2d 950,\n961 (5th Cir. 1993) (upholding award of $75,000 in fees based on\n500 hours worked and $150 per hour billing rate); Shipes v. Trinity\nIndus., 987 F.2d 311, 319-23 (5th Cir. 1993) (affirming $144,712.70\nfee award based on 1,306.88 hours worked and billing rates of $165\nper hour and $140 per hour).\n\n                                      30\n\freasonableness        of    the     rates       charged     renders      its     argument\n\nmeritless.50\n\n\n\n                                            D\n\n     The    University       also    contends       that    the    court       failed   to\n\nsegregate fees incurred through Mota's dispute with Caffesse from\n\nthose     generated    by    his    litigation       with    the   University.          The\n\nUniversity contends that the majority of discovery disputes were\n\nbetween Mota and Caffesse, who had separate legal counsel. The\n\nUniversity     accordingly        seeks     a    set-off    from   the      $290,000     in\n\nsettlement proceeds Mota received from Caffesse's insurers. It\n\nargues that the settlement fund presumably compensated Mota's\n\nattorneys    for   their     efforts      against     Caffesse.       The      University\n\ninvokes the general presumption against double recovery.51\n\n     Mota urges this Court to uphold the award as a reasonable\n\nexercise of the district court's discretion. He contends that the\n\nUniversity failed to preserve its objection at the trial level\n\nbecause it did not offer reasons in support of its argument that\n\nindividual entries were duplicative. This argument fails, however,\n\n     50\n       We note that, although the court did not award sanctions for\nthe University's conduct, it observed that the University had\nengaged in numerous discovery abuses, \"many of which were extremely\nfrivolous in nature and clearly appeared to be an attempt to harass\nor intimidate the Plaintiff.\" The court concluded that these\nabusive tactics prolonged the litigation between the parties and\npartially justified the magnitude of Mota's fee award.\n     51\n       See In re Texas General Petroleum Corp., 52 F.3d 1330, 1340\n(5th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                            31\n\fas Mota concedes that the University pointed out specific items to\n\nthe trial court. Moreover, \"the burden of proof of reasonableness\n\nof the number of hours is on the fee applicant, and not on the\n\nopposing party to prove their unreasonableness.\"52\n\n     Mota contends that the award itself was reasonable and not\n\nduplicative. Mota's counsel represented to the trial court that\n\nthey had carefully segregated time spent on the case which was\n\nunique to Caffesse. The district court reasonably credited this\n\nassertion. The court also found that the majority of claims against\n\nCaffesse were \"inextricably intertwined with the claims against the\n\nUniversity and that it would be impossible to segregate all of the\n\ntime for purposes of making a determination of attorney's fees.\" A\n\ncourt need not segregate fees where the facts and issues are so\n\nclosely interwoven.53 Moreover, until the settlement, Caffesse and\n\nthe University coordinated their defense efforts. The preceding\n\nconsiderations amply support the district court's award.\n\n\n\n                                   E\n\n     Mota also refutes the University's suggestion that it receive\n\na credit for the settlement with Caffesse. He points out that cases\n\nin which a court awards a settlement credit to a non-settling\n\n\n     52\n       Leroy v. City of Houston, 831 F.2d 576, 586 (5th Cir. 1987)\n(citation omitted).\n     53\n          See Abell v. Potomac Ins. Co., 946 F.2d 1160, 1169 (5th Cir.\n1991).\n\n                                   32\n\fdefendant   involve   co-defendants   liable   under   the   same   legal\n\ntheory.54 But Caffesse and the University are not joint tortfeasors,\n\nand these cases involve set-offs for liability, not attorney's\n\nfees. Even if we were to extend this principle to claims for\n\nattorney's fees,55 a set-off would only be justified where the non-\n\nsettling party demonstrates that it was required to pay for legal\n\nwork attributable to the settling party. As we have already noted,\n\nthe University has not made such a showing. The district court's\n\nfee award was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                  V\n\n\n\n     54\n       See, e.g., McDermott, Inc. v. Amclyde & River Don Castings,\nLtd., 511 U.S. 202, 208 (1994) (stating that only when \"a plaintiff\nsettles with one of several joint tortfeasors [are] the nonsettling\ndefendants . . . entitled to a credit for that settlement\").\n     55\n       The University cites Ochoa v. Employers Nat'l Ins. Co., 724\nF.2d 1171, 1178 (5th Cir. 1984), in which this Court applied the\nprinciple of double recovery to the allocation of attorney's fees\nin a suit for benefits under the Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers'\nCompensation Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 901-950 (1976). We observed that\ndistrict courts have discretion to adjust an attorney's fee to\nallow an injured longshoreman to share in the recovery. We also\nheld that the court's allocation should not allow double recovery\nwhere the attorney has already obtained a fee for securing\ncompensation benefits. See id. The Supreme Court subsequently\nvacated the panel opinion. See 469 U.S. 1082 (1984). On remand, we\nreaffirmed the approach adopted in the original opinion. See Ochoa\nv. Employers Nat'l Ins. Co., 754 F.2d 1196, 1199 (5th Cir. 1985).\nThis case does not, however, compel the award of a set-off based on\na prior settlement involving a different party under different\nlegal theories. Moreover, the University fails to indicate how much\nof the settlement allegedly compensated Mota's attorneys. Nor does\nthe University specify the corresponding level of the settlement\ncredit it seeks.\n\n                                 33\n\f     The University challenges the court's award of costs to Mota.\n\nAn award of costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.56 The\n\nUniversity contends that the district court erred in awarding\n\n$3,470.00 for videotaped depositions, $150.46 for an investigation\n\nof Caffesse, and a $1,500.00 mediation fee.57\n\n     Under 28 U.S.C. § 1920, a court may tax the following costs:\n\nfees of the clerk and marshal; fees of the court reporter for all\n\nor any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for\n\nuse in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;\n\nfees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained\n\nfor use in the case; docket fees; compensation of court-appointed\n\nexperts, interpreters, and special interpretation services.58 The\n\nSupreme Court has indicated that federal courts may only award\n\nthose costs articulated in section 1920 absent explicit statutory\n\nor contractual authorization to the contrary.59\n\n     In Title VII cases, a district court has an additional source\n\nof authority for applying attorney's fees and costs, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-5(k).    This   provision   empowers   the   court   to   \"allow   the\n\n\n     56\n          See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983).\n     57\n       This figure reflects only the fee charged by the mediator,\nand not the attorney's fees incurred through the attempted\nmediation of this case.\n     58\n          28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2001).\n     59\n       Crawford Fitting Co. v.

We have observed that \"28 U.S.C. § 1920(2)\n\nonly allows for the recovery of '[f]ees of the court reporter for\n\nall or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained\n\nfor use in the case.' There is no provision for videotapes of\n\ndepositions.\"62 This reading is consistent with the text of 28\n\n\n     60\n          42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k) (2001).\n     61\n       Mennor v.

Bd., 919 F.2d 374, 380 (5th Cir. 1990).\nIn 1993 Rule 54(d)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was\namended to outline procedures for filing claims for \"attorney's\nfees and related non-taxable expenses.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)\n(2001). The provision in question applies \"to requests for\nreimbursement of expenses, not taxable as costs, when recoverable\nunder governing law incident to the award of fees.\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n54(d)(2) (advisory committee notes) (emphasis added). The rule\nchange therefore does not and could not expand the scope of\nexpenses recoverable as incidental to the award of fees. The\ngoverning substantive law dictates recoverable expenses.\n     62\n       Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc., 135 F.3d 1041, 1049 (5th Cir.\n1998). But see Morrison v. Reichhold Chems., Inc., 97 F.3d 460\n(11th Cir. 1996) (finding videotape deposition to be taxable, given\nsection 1920 and Fed. R. Civ.

As\n\nthe court abused its discretion, we are compelled to vacate its\n\naward of the costs associated with videotaped depositions.\n\n     While the court also erred in taxing the University with the\n\ncosts of mediation, its award of investigation costs was not an\n\nabuse of discretion. Neither category of expenses is within section\n\n1920. We   find    that    section       2000e-5(k)   supports       the    award   of\n\ninvestigation     fees    as     a   \"reasonable    out-of-pocket          expense.\"65\n\nHowever, mediation costs do not fall within the limited category of\n\nexpenses taxable under Title VII. In sum, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in awarding the cost of\n\nvideotaped depositions and mediation.\n\n\n\n                                          VI\n\n\nF.2d 1361, 1367-69 (7th Cir. 1990) (same).\n     63\n       See Crawford Fitting Co. v.

At all relevant times, Dr. Raul Caffesse was the head of the Periodontics Department at the Dental Branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caffesse and Mota knew each other prior to Mota's term at the University. Mota's parents, who were also periodontists, knew Caffesse and would receive him into their home on social visits. Likewise, Caffesse would entertain Mota's parents when they traveled to the United States. After Mota moved to Houston, he continued this social relationship with Caffesse and Caffesse's family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caffesse's stature as a renowned periodontist prompted Mota to apply for a position at the University. Caffesse, who had an endowed professorship named after him at the Dental School, was considered to be among the ten most famous academic periodontists in the world.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1996 Mota and Caffesse participated in a three-day conference in Monterrey, Mexico. The event was jointly sponsored by the Dental School and the University of Nuevo Laredo. Although Mota was not originally scheduled to attend, Caffesse told Mota several days before the trip that he should accompany him as a representative of the Dental School. Caffesse arranged for them to share the same hotel room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota later testified that Caffesse engaged in unwanted and offensive sexual conduct toward him while they were in the hotel room. During their time in Mexico, Caffesse allegedly told Mota that he had to \"get along with him and that people who worked with him had to get along with [him] and that he only wanted to know [Mota] better.\" Caffesse also suggested that Mota's immigration status could be jeopardized if he no longer worked at the University.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the trip to Monterrey, Caffesse promised Mota that the incidents which occurred in Mexico would not happen again. He also told Mota that he had arranged for him to give a presentation at another seminar and that Mota would receive a $500 honorarium. Mota asserts that he took the honorarium money and purchased a present for Caffesse in excess of the $500. According to Mota, the gift was motivated by his desire not to be indebted to Caffesse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Caffesse's assurances, incidents of harassment allegedly continued. Mota later testified that Caffesse engaged in unwanted and offensive sexual advances at conferences he attended in Philadelphia, Breckenridge, and Orlando. Caffesse also allegedly engaged in other acts of sexual harassment while he and Mota were in Houston. In the face of Caffesse's advances, Mota canceled conference engagements which he knew Caffesse would also attend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also supports the inference that Caffesse threatened Mota. During one conference, Mota refused to room with Caffesse. Caffesse angrily raised his hand in the air and told Mota that he could not do that to him and could not work in the department if Mota kept rejecting him. On another occasion, Caffesse allegedly told Mota that the University would defend Caffesse--as it allegedly had in the past--in any type of complaint brought against him. Caffesse further informed Mota that Caffesse disliked certain persons at the school, and that he had \"helped them to leave\" the school. He regularly admonished Mota not to tell anyone of his advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 1997, Mota submitted a detailed, written sexual harassment complaint against Caffesse to the University. According to Mota, he and a member of the Sexual Harassment Board had agreed that the investigatory panel would not include persons who had past dealings with Caffesse or who were associated with the Dental or Medical schools. Prof. George Stancel was appointed chairman of the three-member panel. Stancel was a medical school professor who apparently had worked closely with the spouse of a professor who worked regularly with Caffesse. Stancel later testified that he was aware of Caffesse's stature at the Dental School and that he had met him on at least one occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The members of the panel concluded that they were unable to determine whether or not Caffesse had violated the University's sexual harassment policy. During the investigation, Caffesse admitted to the panel that he had sexually propositioned Mota on two trips following the Mexico trip. Another member of the University testified before the panel that \"if you cross Caffesse, you are definitely in trouble. In other words, if you tell him 'no' you better watch out.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mota had recorded conversations with Caffesse, he did not submit these to the panel. The panel never asked for such evidence; nor was the panel aware of its existence. Mota later played the tapes to the jury in the trial before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon issuing its decision, the panel notified Mota and suggested that, if he had new evidence, he could request a reopening of his case. Despite the evidence contained on the tapes, Mota did not ask the panel to reopen the case. Four days after the decision, Mota requested \"protection against further harassment and retaliation\" by Caffesse. In response, Caffesse told the Dean of the Dental School, Dr. Ronald Johnson, that he was willing to work out an arrangement acceptable to Mota, under which the two professors could continue working in the Periodontics Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dean Johnson did not learn of Mota's University complaint until July 16, 1997, when Mota sent him a courtesy copy of a complaint he had filed with the EEOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> University policy prohibits the panel from notifying the appropriate administrative authority in the University that a complaint has been filed. According to M. David Low, the University president, Johnson was the person responsible for protecting Mota from retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a meeting with Caffesse and Mota on July 23, 1997, Dean Johnson asked Mota to write a memo describing parameters under which he would feel comfortable working in the Department. When Mota declined to do so, Johnson instructed Caffesse to draft the document. The next day, Caffesse sent Mota a letter outlining guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the charges of retaliation contained in Mota's EEOC complaint, the University hired an outside attorney to conduct an investigation. The University contends that Mota did not cooperate with the attorney, whose April 9, 1998 report concluded that no retaliation had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota does not allege that any further acts of sexual harassment occurred after the filing of his April 1997 complaint. He contends, however, that the University retaliated against him. First, he asserts that, in the wake of his complaint, Caffesse arranged Mota's schedule so as to bring them into constant contact. Mota alleges that Caffesse made this scheduling decision in the face of Mota's objections. When Caffesse relented and changed Mota's schedule, he reassigned him from some of the desirable graduate clinics to the less prestigious undergraduate clinics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 1997, Johnson and Low denied Mota a $2,500 stipend for serving as the Dental School clinical coordinator. Mota had been the clinical coordinator since late 1995. However, the University contends that Mota had not performed the duties of clinical coordinator since September 1996. The University argues that the discontinuation of Mota's stipend resulted from an inquiry sent by Mota to Johnson, in which Mota stated that he continued to receive supplemental pay for the clinical coordinator position. Johnson testified that he stopped payment simply to correct an administrative oversight, as the University would not pay someone who was not doing the work required by the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1997, the University denied Mota's request for a paid six-month leave of absence. President Low denied Mota's request, yet authorized six months of unpaid leave beginning November 3, 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Mota was to return to work on May 1, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Mota was on leave, he began looking for another job and visited his parents in Venezuela several times. He also requested that the University grant him access to his office, a microscope, and the library to allow him to conduct research while on leave. Johnson refused these requests, denying him access to a microscope and preventing him from entering his office. Johnson further ordered Mota's name removed from the University letterhead and from his office. He prevented Mota from serving on mock oral boards and thesis committees. He also refused to allow him to teach a seminar in Spain, through which Mota could have earned $2,000. Mota also alleges that Johnson and other University professors ostracized him, warning students not to associate with him. Johnson allegedly told one graduate student that if he ever caught the student in contact with Mota, the University would disqualify him as a student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an undated letter, Mota requested an additional six months of unpaid personal leave. Low and Johnson refused the requested extension, informing Mota that they would consider his failure to resume work after May 26, 1998 to be a resignation from the faculty. This letter denied the extension ostensibly because Mota gave no reasons for the request. In his letter, Mota had cited his hope for a \"mutually beneficial resolution.\" Low and Johnson stated that an extension would not facilitate this objective and would not be in the best interests of either Mota or the University. When Mota did not return to work on May 26, 1998, the University terminated him. Three months later, Mota accepted a lower-paying position with the University of Pittsburgh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 30, 1998, Mota filed suit against the University in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation. Mota subsequently amended his complaint to add a claim against Caffesse, in his individual capacity, for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial judge ultimately dismissed the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. After Caffesse and Mota entered into a settlement agreement for $290,000, the court then dismissed all remaining claims against Caffesse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a six-day trial, a jury returned a verdict against the University. The jury found that Mota had been subjected to unlawful sexual harassment; that the harassment did not result in a tangible employment action against Mota; that the University failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassing behavior towards Mota; that Mota did not unreasonably fail to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities made available by the University; and that the University retaliated against Mota. The jury awarded $15,000.00 in compensatory damages, $104,435.00 in back pay, and delivered an advisory verdict of $328,565.00 in front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order dated December 8, 1999, Judge Gilmore awarded $388,367.51 to Mota for attorney's fees and expenses. The court also awarded the judgment amount plus interest for compensatory damages and back pay, yet reduced the jury's recommended front pay to $194,989.00. On December 20, 1999, the court denied the University's motion for judgment as a matter law and to amend the judgment. The University appeals this ruling and the December 8 final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on Mota's Title VII retaliation claim. This Court reviews the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo, according to the same standard applied by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Judgment as a matter of law is warranted if, after viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no \"legally sufficient evidentiary basis\" for a reasonable jury to have found for the prevailing party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"[T]he court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that 'evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a claim for retaliation, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he engaged in protected activity, as described in Title VII; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> \"Protected activity\" is defined as opposition to any practice rendered unlawful by Title VII, including making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> \"Adverse employment actions\" include only \"ultimate employment decisions . . . 'such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> An employer's action does not rise to the level of an \"adverse employment action\" when it fails to have more than \"mere tangential effect on a possible future ultimate employment decision.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> To demonstrate causation, the employee \"must show that 'but for' the protected activity, the adverse employment action would not have occurred.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> If the plaintiff presents evidence supporting the prima facie case, plus evidence that the reasons given by the employer for the adverse employment action were pretextual, a jury may infer the existence of retaliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University argues, first, that Mota can not demonstrate the existence of an adverse employment action. Although the jury found that Mota was subjected to sexual harassment, it determined that the sexual harassment did not result in a \"tangible employment action.\" The Supreme Court has defined \"tangible employment action\" as \"a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> A tangible employment action in most cases inflicts direct economic harm and must involve an official act by the company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In this case, the jury charge included a definition of \"tangible employment action\" which substantially incorporated these elements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University asserts that a tangible employment action is substantially equivalent to an adverse employment action. The University points to the similarity between the type of actions encompassed by the two categories. It contends that the jury's finding of no tangible employment action precludes the existence of an adverse employment action for purposes of Mota's retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is without merit. The jury was given a separate instruction for retaliation, in which the court noted that an adverse employment action was required. The court's explanation of adverse employment action was similar to its previous definition of tangible employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> In finding that the University had retaliated against Mota, however, the jury implicitly found that an adverse employment action had been taken. Moreover, the relevant employment action resulting from sexual harassment, as opposed to retaliation, may differ. Retaliation occurs in response to protected activity, whereas a tangible employment action is the result of the harassment itself. A rational jury could have concluded both that no tangible employment action resulted from the harassment and that the University subsequently retaliated against Mota for filing a complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University next argues that many of the actions asserted by Mota do not rise to the level of \"adverse employment actions.\" Mota contends that the following events were causally linked to the filing of his complaints with the University and the EEOC: (1) the University placed Caffesse in charge of monitoring any further harassment; (2) Mota was ostracized by faculty and students; (3) he was barred from entering the Dental School; (4) Mota's name was removed from his office door and from the University letterhead; (5) Mota was stripped of his duties as principal investigator on certain projects; (6) the University prevented Mota from continuing to serve on mock oral boards and on thesis committees; (7) the University refused to allow him to teach seminars in Spain (which would have yielded some $2,000); (8) the University ceased paying Mota a $2,500 annual stipend; (9) the University refused to grant Mota paid leave; (10) the University denied his request for an extension of unpaid leave; and (11) the University treated Mota's failure to return by May 26, 1999 as a resignation. Although some of the preceding events do not qualify as \"ultimate employment decisions,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> at least four of the actions allegedly taken by the University meet this definition. Moreover, the evidence regarding these events provides ample support for the jury's finding of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University's discontinuation of Mota's $2,500 stipend on August 20, 1997 is a compensation decision, thereby qualifying as an adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> The University characterizes the action as merely a \"business decision,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> contesting the jury's inference of retaliation. The University argues that the \"undisputed evidence\" reveals that Mota had not been fulfilling the duties of clinical coordinator since September 1996, when Dr. Walter E. Dimmitt allegedly assumed Mota's position. However, Mota testified that Dimmitt was given the separate position of \"clinical director,\" not \"clinical coordinator.\" Mota testified that he continued to serve as clinical coordinator until Dean Johnson and President Low removed him from this position on August 20, 1997. The record also contains a letter, dated August 29, 1997, in which Mota denies having relinquished these duties. A rational jury could infer from this evidence that the University's reasons for discontinuing Mota's stipend were pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also argues that its denial of Mota's request for paid leave was not causally linked to his sexual harassment complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> As the University observes, the record does not indicate that a similarly situated employee was denied six months of paid leave. The University implies that the causal link between Mota's protected activity and the denial of his paid leave request is consequently too tenuous to support a jury finding. However, while the fact that no similarly situated faculty member was denied paid leave may cast doubt on Mota's retaliation claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> it is not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury could have found that the University's denial of paid leave was causally related to Mota's protected activity. The University's Handbook of Operating Procedures stated that paid leave could be granted \"for a wide variety of reasons.\" A jury could conclude that the University refused to exercise its discretion to grant Mota paid leave. The University asserts that Mota was ineligible for paid leave, arguing that he had exhausted all accrued paid sick and annual leave prior to November 1997. The University's position is not compelled by the record, and a jury could have determined that the proffered reason for denying Mota paid leave was pretextual. Indeed, the jury's finding that the University had already retaliated against Mota by discontinuing his stipend further supports an inference of retaliatory animus in the paid leave context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also asserts that its denial of Mota's request for an extension of his unpaid leave can not support a retaliation claim. \"[E]mployment actions are not adverse where pay, benefits, and level of responsibility remain the same.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> The University contends that denial of unpaid--as opposed to paid--leave can not be an adverse employment action because it does not deprive Mota of pay, benefits, or level of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University's contention is without merit. Unpaid leave facially qualifies as a benefit. This Court has recognized that the granting of leave, more generally, is an \"ultimate employment decision.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> This Court has not differentiated between paid and unpaid leave. Moreover, it is difficult to conceive of a principled basis for such a distinction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> The University's argument consequently fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury could conclude that the University retaliated against Mota by denying his request for additional unpaid leave. Although the University asserts that Mota was granted medical leave, Mota testified that he was granted \"personal leave,\" which may be granted for up to twelve months. The record indicates that another University employee was granted one year of unpaid personal leave because his wife did not like the weather in Houston. In the face of an arguably more compelling rationale--i.e., Mota's difficulties with Caffesse and his medical problems<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>--the University refused Mota's request for the same amount of unpaid leave. The University informed Mota that the grant of additional leave was not in the best interests of the University. It argued at trial that Mota had failed to provide a \"legitimate, documented reason for an extension of his leave.\" The University further asserted that Mota had already accepted a position with the University of Pittsburgh at the time of his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could have disbelieved each of these proffered justifications, concluding that the University's explanation for refusing Mota's request was a pretext for retaliation. First, Mota testified at trial that no documentation beyond that which he had already supplied the University was necessary. A jury could have credited this assertion. Second, Mota asserts that he had not yet accepted a position in Pittsburgh at the time of the denial of his request for leave. Indeed, the record contains a letter from the Provost of the University of Pittsburgh, dated August 19, 1998, which indicates the formal approval of Mota's appointment as Visiting Assistant Professor of Periodontics. The jury could have reasonably inferred from this evidence that Mota had not accepted the offer by May 19, 1998, when the University denied his request for additional leave.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> The evidence supports a jury finding of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury also could have determined that the University ultimately terminated Mota because of his involvement in protected activity. Although the University asserts that Mota resigned, a jury could have found that it terminated him. In fact, Mota submitted a letter dated June 26, 1998, in which he contests Johnson's assertion that he had resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the inference that Mota's termination was motivated by retaliatory animus. Mota's ostracism at the hands of University employees and the University's decision to strip of him of certain duties and privileges support a finding of retaliatory animus. This conclusion is strengthened by a finding that the University retaliated against Mota by discontinuing his stipend and denying his leave requests. We therefore find no error in the district court's refusal to enter judgment as a matter of law on Mota's retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University contends that the trial court erred in entering judgment on Mota's sexual harassment claim. The University argues, first, that Caffesse's harassment of Mota was not sufficiently severe or pervasive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> The plaintiff in a hostile work environment claim must establish that: (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment was based on his sex; (4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of his employment; and (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take remedial action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> A hostile work environment claim requires the presence of a work environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> \"Whether an environment is hostile or abusive depends on a totality of circumstances, focusing on factors such as the frequency of the conduct, the severity of the conduct, the degree to which the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, and the degree to which the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> This Court has held that \"[d]iscriminatory verbal intimidation, ridicule, and insults may be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment that violates Title VII.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could rationally infer that Caffesse's conduct was sufficiently extreme as to create a hostile work environment. The evidence supports a finding that Caffesse engaged in repeated, aggressive sexual advances in the face of adamant refusals by Mota. A jury could find this conduct to be humiliating and degrading, particularly in conjunction with Caffesse's threats. Although much of this conduct was verbal, there was also evidence of repeated physical contact. Moreover, the record reflects that Mota suffered emotional distress and psychological problems in the wake of the harassment. Although there is little evidence that Mota's performance as a teacher and researcher suffered at the time of the harassment, the record does reflect that he came to avoid engagements and conferences at which Caffesse was also present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Indeed, Mota felt compelled to take a leave from his position in the wake of Caffesse's actions. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University further argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider Mota's Title VII harassment claims to the extent that they are based on events occurring in Mexico. The University essentially contends that federal jurisdiction does not lie given the extraterritorial events alleged and the fact that Mota is not a U.S. citizen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo the validity of Mota's Title VII interpretation, subject matter jurisdiction would not be present if the events in Mexico were the sole basis for Mota's harassment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> However, Mota's claim is also supported by alleged acts of harassment in Breckenridge, Houston, Orlando, and Philadelphia. Given the preceding incidents, which occurred in the United States, the University can not demonstrate that Mota's harassment claim is \"wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> As Mota states a potentially viable harassment claim, federal jurisdiction is present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also challenges the jury's finding that it did not establish affirmative defenses to Mota's harassment claim. Where harassment does not result in a tangible employment action, the defendant may offer the following affirmative defenses: \"(1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any such sexual harassment, and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* A jury could reasonably conclude that the University failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassment. The jury could conclude that the panel's failure to discipline Caffesse or take more affirmative steps against him was unreasonable. In this case, the University decided to simply let Mota and Caffesse work out a mutually agreeable accommodation. Although an employer need not use the most serious sanction available to punish an offender,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> the University did not even find that Caffesse had engaged in sexual harassment. Nor did the University issue a reprimand or warning, despite its policy against even consensual sexual relations between supervisors and subordinates. In the past, the school had reprimanded other supervisors who had engaged in consensual relationships with subordinates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> Finally, the University's retaliation against Mota undermines its claim that it was attempting to prevent future harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also supports the jury's finding that Mota took advantage of available remedies. The University criticizes Mota for not having filed his complaint with the Harassment Board sooner and for failing to disclose tapes of conversations with Caffesse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has not articulated a bright-line test regarding when a delay in filing a complaint becomes \"unreasonable.\" Mota filed his complaint in late April 1997, approximately nine months after the incidents in Mexico and eight months after the events in Philadelphia. Although this Court's jurisprudence indicates that a delay of three months appears not to be excessive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> a delay of eight or nine months is more problematic. However, in light of Caffesse's repeated threats of retaliation, a jury could infer that Mota's delay was not unreasonable. Mota may have believed that resort to the University's administrative process was ineffectual, given Caffesse's influence at the University. According to Mota's testimony, Caffesse told him that the University would protect and defend him against any complaint. Thus, Mota's delay in filing his complaint does not warrant reversing the jury's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could also find that Mota's failure to disclose tape recordings of conversations between him and Caffesse was not unreasonable. Mota fully participated in the investigation, testifying before the panel and providing an extensive written complaint. He may have viewed the production of additional evidence, such as recordings of conversations, as futile, given his concerns over the effectiveness of the panel's inquiry, the composition of the panel, and Caffesse's influence. A jury could have concluded that Mota's actions did not constitute an unreasonable failure to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, a jury could have determined that the University failed to meet its burden of proof in establishing its affirmative defenses. The district court did not err in entering judgment on Mota's sexual harassment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University contends that the court's award of front pay was an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> Front pay is a form of equitable relief contemplated by Title VII and is intended \"to compensate the plaintiff for lost future wages and benefits.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> \"[F]ront pay may be awarded if reinstatement is not feasible where\" a hostile relationship exists between the employer and the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> Although front pay is an equitable remedy for the district court to determine, the court may empanel an advisory jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the jury's advisory award of $328,565.00 in front pay, the district court took into account the University's post-trial conduct. This was not error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> After initially reducing the jury's recommended award to reflect only ten years of lost future wages, the court added five additional years of front pay based on an email sent by President Low to all 8,000 University employees. The court determined that the email, which Low sent the day after the jury verdict, was the continuation of a pattern of vindictive behavior demonstrated at trial. In the email, Low expressed his disappointment over the jury's finding of retaliation, stating: \"I want to make it very clear that [Mota] was not fired, but rather failed to return to his faculty duties upon expiration of leave that he had requested and was granted by UT-Houston.\" The district court portrayed the email as attempting to \"present Mota in the worst professional light possible.\" The court also concluded that this behavior would impact Mota's future work prospects. On this basis, the court reduced the jury's front pay award to $194,989.00. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also contends that the front pay awarded by the court failed to take into account the fact that, at the time Mota left the University in 1998, he would not have been considered for tenure at the University until he had completed four more years of work. It contends that the court gave Mota a windfall by treating him as if he had tenure by the time he left the University. However, the University does not point to any specific evidence to refute the court's calculations. The court attempted to reconcile the pay disparity between Mota's position at the University and the lower-paying position he was forced to take in Pittsburgh. This was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University further challenges the court's award of attorney's fees. A district court's award of attorney's fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> The University first contends that the fee award was excessive in comparison with fee awards entered in other Title VII cases requiring more time and attention. The University fails to address the court's application of the Johnson factors,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> and makes only a conclusory assertion about comparable awards. The two cases cited by the University involve substantially lower hour totals and billing rates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> The University's failure to object to specific hours worked and the reasonableness of the rates charged renders its argument meritless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also contends that the court failed to segregate fees incurred through Mota's dispute with Caffesse from those generated by his litigation with the University. The University contends that the majority of discovery disputes were between Mota and Caffesse, who had separate legal counsel. The University accordingly seeks a set-off from the $290,000 in settlement proceeds Mota received from Caffesse's insurers. It argues that the settlement fund presumably compensated Mota's attorneys for their efforts against Caffesse. The University invokes the general presumption against double recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota urges this Court to uphold the award as a reasonable exercise of the district court's discretion. He contends that the University failed to preserve its objection at the trial level because it did not offer reasons in support of its argument that individual entries were duplicative. This argument fails, however, as Mota concedes that the University pointed out specific items to the trial court. Moreover, \"the burden of proof of reasonableness of the number of hours is on the fee applicant, and not on the opposing party to prove their unreasonableness.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota contends that the award itself was reasonable and not duplicative. Mota's counsel represented to the trial court that they had carefully segregated time spent on the case which was unique to Caffesse. The district court reasonably credited this assertion. The court also found that the majority of claims against Caffesse were \"inextricably intertwined with the claims against the University and that it would be impossible to segregate all of the time for purposes of making a determination of attorney's fees.\" A court need not segregate fees where the facts and issues are so closely interwoven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> Moreover, until the settlement, Caffesse and the University coordinated their defense efforts. The preceding considerations amply support the district court's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota also refutes the University's suggestion that it receive a credit for the settlement with Caffesse. He points out that cases in which a court awards a settlement credit to a non-settling defendant involve co-defendants liable under the same legal theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a> But Caffesse and the University are not joint tortfeasors, and these cases involve set-offs for liability, not attorney's fees. Even if we were to extend this principle to claims for attorney's fees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a> a set-off would only be justified where the non-settling party demonstrates that it was required to pay for legal work attributable to the settling party. As we have already noted, the University has not made such a showing. The district court's fee award was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University challenges the court's award of costs to Mota. An award of costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a> The University contends that the district court erred in awarding $3,470.00 for videotaped depositions, $150.46 for an investigation of Caffesse, and a $1,500.00 mediation fee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920, a court may tax the following costs: fees of the clerk and marshal; fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses; fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case; docket fees; compensation of court-appointed experts, interpreters, and special interpretation services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a> The Supreme Court has indicated that federal courts may only award those costs articulated in section 1920 absent explicit statutory or contractual authorization to the contrary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Title VII cases, a district court has an additional source of authority for applying attorney's fees and costs, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(k). This provision empowers the court to \"allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> This Court has interpreted the \"attorney's fee\" allowed by Section 2000e-5(k) to include \"reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the attorney which are normally charged to a fee-paying client, in the course of providing legal services,\" such as postage, photocopying, paralegal services, long distance telephone charges, and travel costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court erred in taxing the University with the cost of videotaped depositions. We have observed that \"28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920(2) only allows for the recovery of '[f]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case.' There is no provision for videotapes of depositions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a> This reading is consistent with the text of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920(2) and the Supreme Court's admonition that we strictly construe this provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a> Nor is it feasible to characterize videotaped depositions as \"out-of-pocket expenses\" similar to postage and long-distance telephone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a> Section 2000e-5(k) therefore lends no support for the court's ruling. As the court abused its discretion, we are compelled to vacate its award of the costs associated with videotaped depositions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the court also erred in taxing the University with the costs of mediation, its award of investigation costs was not an abuse of discretion. Neither category of expenses is within section 1920. We find that section 2000e-5(k) supports the award of investigation fees as a \"reasonable out-of-pocket expense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> However, mediation costs do not fall within the limited category of expenses taxable under Title VII.

The University had ample notice of the basis for a possible hearing request, as Mota noted the implications of the email in three separate pleadings prior to the court's entry of final judgment. Although the University moved for an evidentiary hearing on equitable relief, it did not argue that the email warranted such a hearing. The University waived any putative hearing right. See Bueno v.

We observed that district courts have discretion to adjust an attorney's fee to allow an injured longshoreman to share in the recovery. We also held that the court's allocation should not allow double recovery where the attorney has already obtained a fee for securing compensation benefits. See id. The Supreme Court subsequently vacated the panel opinion. See 469 U.S. 1082 (1984). On remand, we reaffirmed the approach adopted in the original opinion. See Ochoa v. Employers Nat'l Ins. Co., 754 F.2d 1196, 1199 (5th Cir. 1985). This case does not, however, compel the award of a set-off based on a prior settlement involving a different party under different legal theories.

A professor at the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center filed suit, alleging that he was harassed by his supervisor. He also claimed that the University retaliated against him for lodging complaints with the University and the EEOC.

The University argues that the jury's retaliation verdict was not supported by an adverse employment action and lacked an adequate basis in fact; that the alleged acts of harassment were not sufficiently severe or pervasive; that the jury erred in finding that the University had not established its affirmative defenses to the harassment claim; and that the court's award of front pay, attorney's fees, and costs was an abuse of discretion. We affirm the court's judgment in virtually all respects, vacating only a portion of its award of costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Dr. Luis F. Mota, a resident alien from Caracas, began work in 1993 as a visiting professor in the Department of Periodontics at the Dental Branch of the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He began his first year as a tenure-track professor with the University in 1995. At all relevant times, Dr. Raul Caffesse was the head of the Periodontics Department at the Dental Branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caffesse and Mota knew each other prior to Mota's term at the University. Mota's parents, who were also periodontists, knew Caffesse and would receive him into their home on social visits. Likewise, Caffesse would entertain Mota's parents when they traveled to the United States. After Mota moved to Houston, he continued this social relationship with Caffesse and Caffesse's family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caffesse's stature as a renowned periodontist prompted Mota to apply for a position at the University. Caffesse, who had an endowed professorship named after him at the Dental School, was considered to be among the ten most famous academic periodontists in the world.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1996 Mota and Caffesse participated in a three-day conference in Monterrey, Mexico. The event was jointly sponsored by the Dental School and the University of Nuevo Laredo. Although Mota was not originally scheduled to attend, Caffesse told Mota several days before the trip that he should accompany him as a representative of the Dental School. Caffesse arranged for them to share the same hotel room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota later testified that Caffesse engaged in unwanted and offensive sexual conduct toward him while they were in the hotel room. During their time in Mexico, Caffesse allegedly told Mota that he had to \"get along with him and that people who worked with him had to get along with [him] and that he only wanted to know [Mota] better.\" Caffesse also suggested that Mota's immigration status could be jeopardized if he no longer worked at the University.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the trip to Monterrey, Caffesse promised Mota that the incidents which occurred in Mexico would not happen again. He also told Mota that he had arranged for him to give a presentation at another seminar and that Mota would receive a $500 honorarium. Mota asserts that he took the honorarium money and purchased a present for Caffesse in excess of the $500. According to Mota, the gift was motivated by his desire not to be indebted to Caffesse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Caffesse's assurances, incidents of harassment allegedly continued. Mota later testified that Caffesse engaged in unwanted and offensive sexual advances at conferences he attended in Philadelphia, Breckenridge, and Orlando. Caffesse also allegedly engaged in other acts of sexual harassment while he and Mota were in Houston. In the face of Caffesse's advances, Mota canceled conference engagements which he knew Caffesse would also attend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also supports the inference that Caffesse threatened Mota. During one conference, Mota refused to room with Caffesse. Caffesse angrily raised his hand in the air and told Mota that he could not do that to him and could not work in the department if Mota kept rejecting him. On another occasion, Caffesse allegedly told Mota that the University would defend Caffesse--as it allegedly had in the past--in any type of complaint brought against him. Caffesse further informed Mota that Caffesse disliked certain persons at the school, and that he had \"helped them to leave\" the school. He regularly admonished Mota not to tell anyone of his advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 23, 1997, Mota submitted a detailed, written sexual harassment complaint against Caffesse to the University. According to Mota, he and a member of the Sexual Harassment Board had agreed that the investigatory panel would not include persons who had past dealings with Caffesse or who were associated with the Dental or Medical schools. Prof. George Stancel was appointed chairman of the three-member panel. Stancel was a medical school professor who apparently had worked closely with the spouse of a professor who worked regularly with Caffesse. Stancel later testified that he was aware of Caffesse's stature at the Dental School and that he had met him on at least one occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The members of the panel concluded that they were unable to determine whether or not Caffesse had violated the University's sexual harassment policy. During the investigation, Caffesse admitted to the panel that he had sexually propositioned Mota on two trips following the Mexico trip. Another member of the University testified before the panel that \"if you cross Caffesse, you are definitely in trouble. In other words, if you tell him 'no' you better watch out.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mota had recorded conversations with Caffesse, he did not submit these to the panel. The panel never asked for such evidence; nor was the panel aware of its existence. Mota later played the tapes to the jury in the trial before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon issuing its decision, the panel notified Mota and suggested that, if he had new evidence, he could request a reopening of his case. Despite the evidence contained on the tapes, Mota did not ask the panel to reopen the case. Four days after the decision, Mota requested \"protection against further harassment and retaliation\" by Caffesse. In response, Caffesse told the Dean of the Dental School, Dr. Ronald Johnson, that he was willing to work out an arrangement acceptable to Mota, under which the two professors could continue working in the Periodontics Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dean Johnson did not learn of Mota's University complaint until July 16, 1997, when Mota sent him a courtesy copy of a complaint he had filed with the EEOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> University policy prohibits the panel from notifying the appropriate administrative authority in the University that a complaint has been filed. According to M. David Low, the University president, Johnson was the person responsible for protecting Mota from retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a meeting with Caffesse and Mota on July 23, 1997, Dean Johnson asked Mota to write a memo describing parameters under which he would feel comfortable working in the Department. When Mota declined to do so, Johnson instructed Caffesse to draft the document. The next day, Caffesse sent Mota a letter outlining guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the charges of retaliation contained in Mota's EEOC complaint, the University hired an outside attorney to conduct an investigation. The University contends that Mota did not cooperate with the attorney, whose April 9, 1998 report concluded that no retaliation had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota does not allege that any further acts of sexual harassment occurred after the filing of his April 1997 complaint. He contends, however, that the University retaliated against him. First, he asserts that, in the wake of his complaint, Caffesse arranged Mota's schedule so as to bring them into constant contact. Mota alleges that Caffesse made this scheduling decision in the face of Mota's objections. When Caffesse relented and changed Mota's schedule, he reassigned him from some of the desirable graduate clinics to the less prestigious undergraduate clinics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 1997, Johnson and Low denied Mota a $2,500 stipend for serving as the Dental School clinical coordinator. Mota had been the clinical coordinator since late 1995. However, the University contends that Mota had not performed the duties of clinical coordinator since September 1996. The University argues that the discontinuation of Mota's stipend resulted from an inquiry sent by Mota to Johnson, in which Mota stated that he continued to receive supplemental pay for the clinical coordinator position. Johnson testified that he stopped payment simply to correct an administrative oversight, as the University would not pay someone who was not doing the work required by the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1997, the University denied Mota's request for a paid six-month leave of absence. President Low denied Mota's request, yet authorized six months of unpaid leave beginning November 3, 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Mota was to return to work on May 1, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Mota was on leave, he began looking for another job and visited his parents in Venezuela several times. He also requested that the University grant him access to his office, a microscope, and the library to allow him to conduct research while on leave. Johnson refused these requests, denying him access to a microscope and preventing him from entering his office. Johnson further ordered Mota's name removed from the University letterhead and from his office. He prevented Mota from serving on mock oral boards and thesis committees. He also refused to allow him to teach a seminar in Spain, through which Mota could have earned $2,000. Mota also alleges that Johnson and other University professors ostracized him, warning students not to associate with him. Johnson allegedly told one graduate student that if he ever caught the student in contact with Mota, the University would disqualify him as a student.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an undated letter, Mota requested an additional six months of unpaid personal leave. Low and Johnson refused the requested extension, informing Mota that they would consider his failure to resume work after May 26, 1998 to be a resignation from the faculty. This letter denied the extension ostensibly because Mota gave no reasons for the request. In his letter, Mota had cited his hope for a \"mutually beneficial resolution.\" Low and Johnson stated that an extension would not facilitate this objective and would not be in the best interests of either Mota or the University. When Mota did not return to work on May 26, 1998, the University terminated him. Three months later, Mota accepted a lower-paying position with the University of Pittsburgh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 30, 1998, Mota filed suit against the University in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation. Mota subsequently amended his complaint to add a claim against Caffesse, in his individual capacity, for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial judge ultimately dismissed the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. After Caffesse and Mota entered into a settlement agreement for $290,000, the court then dismissed all remaining claims against Caffesse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a six-day trial, a jury returned a verdict against the University. The jury found that Mota had been subjected to unlawful sexual harassment; that the harassment did not result in a tangible employment action against Mota; that the University failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassing behavior towards Mota; that Mota did not unreasonably fail to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities made available by the University; and that the University retaliated against Mota. The jury awarded $15,000.00 in compensatory damages, $104,435.00 in back pay, and delivered an advisory verdict of $328,565.00 in front pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order dated December 8, 1999, Judge Gilmore awarded $388,367.51 to Mota for attorney's fees and expenses. The court also awarded the judgment amount plus interest for compensatory damages and back pay, yet reduced the jury's recommended front pay to $194,989.00. On December 20, 1999, the court denied the University's motion for judgment as a matter law and to amend the judgment. The University appeals this ruling and the December 8 final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on Mota's Title VII retaliation claim. This Court reviews the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo, according to the same standard applied by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Judgment as a matter of law is warranted if, after viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no \"legally sufficient evidentiary basis\" for a reasonable jury to have found for the prevailing party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> \"[T]he court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that 'evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a claim for retaliation, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he engaged in protected activity, as described in Title VII; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> \"Protected activity\" is defined as opposition to any practice rendered unlawful by Title VII, including making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> \"Adverse employment actions\" include only \"ultimate employment decisions . . . 'such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> An employer's action does not rise to the level of an \"adverse employment action\" when it fails to have more than \"mere tangential effect on a possible future ultimate employment decision.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> To demonstrate causation, the employee \"must show that 'but for' the protected activity, the adverse employment action would not have occurred.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> If the plaintiff presents evidence supporting the prima facie case, plus evidence that the reasons given by the employer for the adverse employment action were pretextual, a jury may infer the existence of retaliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University argues, first, that Mota can not demonstrate the existence of an adverse employment action. Although the jury found that Mota was subjected to sexual harassment, it determined that the sexual harassment did not result in a \"tangible employment action.\" The Supreme Court has defined \"tangible employment action\" as \"a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> A tangible employment action in most cases inflicts direct economic harm and must involve an official act by the company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In this case, the jury charge included a definition of \"tangible employment action\" which substantially incorporated these elements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University asserts that a tangible employment action is substantially equivalent to an adverse employment action. The University points to the similarity between the type of actions encompassed by the two categories. It contends that the jury's finding of no tangible employment action precludes the existence of an adverse employment action for purposes of Mota's retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is without merit. The jury was given a separate instruction for retaliation, in which the court noted that an adverse employment action was required. The court's explanation of adverse employment action was similar to its previous definition of tangible employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> In finding that the University had retaliated against Mota, however, the jury implicitly found that an adverse employment action had been taken. Moreover, the relevant employment action resulting from sexual harassment, as opposed to retaliation, may differ. Retaliation occurs in response to protected activity, whereas a tangible employment action is the result of the harassment itself. A rational jury could have concluded both that no tangible employment action resulted from the harassment and that the University subsequently retaliated against Mota for filing a complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University next argues that many of the actions asserted by Mota do not rise to the level of \"adverse employment actions.\" Mota contends that the following events were causally linked to the filing of his complaints with the University and the EEOC: (1) the University placed Caffesse in charge of monitoring any further harassment; (2) Mota was ostracized by faculty and students; (3) he was barred from entering the Dental School; (4) Mota's name was removed from his office door and from the University letterhead; (5) Mota was stripped of his duties as principal investigator on certain projects; (6) the University prevented Mota from continuing to serve on mock oral boards and on thesis committees; (7) the University refused to allow him to teach seminars in Spain (which would have yielded some $2,000); (8) the University ceased paying Mota a $2,500 annual stipend; (9) the University refused to grant Mota paid leave; (10) the University denied his request for an extension of unpaid leave; and (11) the University treated Mota's failure to return by May 26, 1999 as a resignation. Although some of the preceding events do not qualify as \"ultimate employment decisions,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> at least four of the actions allegedly taken by the University meet this definition. Moreover, the evidence regarding these events provides ample support for the jury's finding of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University's discontinuation of Mota's $2,500 stipend on August 20, 1997 is a compensation decision, thereby qualifying as an adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> The University characterizes the action as merely a \"business decision,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> contesting the jury's inference of retaliation. The University argues that the \"undisputed evidence\" reveals that Mota had not been fulfilling the duties of clinical coordinator since September 1996, when Dr. Walter E. Dimmitt allegedly assumed Mota's position. However, Mota testified that Dimmitt was given the separate position of \"clinical director,\" not \"clinical coordinator.\" Mota testified that he continued to serve as clinical coordinator until Dean Johnson and President Low removed him from this position on August 20, 1997. The record also contains a letter, dated August 29, 1997, in which Mota denies having relinquished these duties. A rational jury could infer from this evidence that the University's reasons for discontinuing Mota's stipend were pretextual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also argues that its denial of Mota's request for paid leave was not causally linked to his sexual harassment complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> As the University observes, the record does not indicate that a similarly situated employee was denied six months of paid leave. The University implies that the causal link between Mota's protected activity and the denial of his paid leave request is consequently too tenuous to support a jury finding. However, while the fact that no similarly situated faculty member was denied paid leave may cast doubt on Mota's retaliation claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> it is not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury could have found that the University's denial of paid leave was causally related to Mota's protected activity. The University's Handbook of Operating Procedures stated that paid leave could be granted \"for a wide variety of reasons.\" A jury could conclude that the University refused to exercise its discretion to grant Mota paid leave. The University asserts that Mota was ineligible for paid leave, arguing that he had exhausted all accrued paid sick and annual leave prior to November 1997. The University's position is not compelled by the record, and a jury could have determined that the proffered reason for denying Mota paid leave was pretextual. Indeed, the jury's finding that the University had already retaliated against Mota by discontinuing his stipend further supports an inference of retaliatory animus in the paid leave context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also asserts that its denial of Mota's request for an extension of his unpaid leave can not support a retaliation claim. \"[E]mployment actions are not adverse where pay, benefits, and level of responsibility remain the same.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> The University contends that denial of unpaid--as opposed to paid--leave can not be an adverse employment action because it does not deprive Mota of pay, benefits, or level of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University's contention is without merit. Unpaid leave facially qualifies as a benefit. This Court has recognized that the granting of leave, more generally, is an \"ultimate employment decision.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> This Court has not differentiated between paid and unpaid leave. Moreover, it is difficult to conceive of a principled basis for such a distinction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> The University's argument consequently fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury could conclude that the University retaliated against Mota by denying his request for additional unpaid leave. Although the University asserts that Mota was granted medical leave, Mota testified that he was granted \"personal leave,\" which may be granted for up to twelve months. The record indicates that another University employee was granted one year of unpaid personal leave because his wife did not like the weather in Houston. In the face of an arguably more compelling rationale--i.e., Mota's difficulties with Caffesse and his medical problems<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>--the University refused Mota's request for the same amount of unpaid leave. The University informed Mota that the grant of additional leave was not in the best interests of the University. It argued at trial that Mota had failed to provide a \"legitimate, documented reason for an extension of his leave.\" The University further asserted that Mota had already accepted a position with the University of Pittsburgh at the time of his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could have disbelieved each of these proffered justifications, concluding that the University's explanation for refusing Mota's request was a pretext for retaliation. First, Mota testified at trial that no documentation beyond that which he had already supplied the University was necessary. A jury could have credited this assertion. Second, Mota asserts that he had not yet accepted a position in Pittsburgh at the time of the denial of his request for leave. Indeed, the record contains a letter from the Provost of the University of Pittsburgh, dated August 19, 1998, which indicates the formal approval of Mota's appointment as Visiting Assistant Professor of Periodontics. The jury could have reasonably inferred from this evidence that Mota had not accepted the offer by May 19, 1998, when the University denied his request for additional leave.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> The evidence supports a jury finding of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A rational jury also could have determined that the University ultimately terminated Mota because of his involvement in protected activity. Although the University asserts that Mota resigned, a jury could have found that it terminated him. In fact, Mota submitted a letter dated June 26, 1998, in which he contests Johnson's assertion that he had resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the inference that Mota's termination was motivated by retaliatory animus. Mota's ostracism at the hands of University employees and the University's decision to strip of him of certain duties and privileges support a finding of retaliatory animus. This conclusion is strengthened by a finding that the University retaliated against Mota by discontinuing his stipend and denying his leave requests. We therefore find no error in the district court's refusal to enter judgment as a matter of law on Mota's retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University contends that the trial court erred in entering judgment on Mota's sexual harassment claim. The University argues, first, that Caffesse's harassment of Mota was not sufficiently severe or pervasive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> The plaintiff in a hostile work environment claim must establish that: (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment was based on his sex; (4) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of his employment; and (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take remedial action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> A hostile work environment claim requires the presence of a work environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> \"Whether an environment is hostile or abusive depends on a totality of circumstances, focusing on factors such as the frequency of the conduct, the severity of the conduct, the degree to which the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, and the degree to which the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> This Court has held that \"[d]iscriminatory verbal intimidation, ridicule, and insults may be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment that violates Title VII.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could rationally infer that Caffesse's conduct was sufficiently extreme as to create a hostile work environment. The evidence supports a finding that Caffesse engaged in repeated, aggressive sexual advances in the face of adamant refusals by Mota. A jury could find this conduct to be humiliating and degrading, particularly in conjunction with Caffesse's threats. Although much of this conduct was verbal, there was also evidence of repeated physical contact. Moreover, the record reflects that Mota suffered emotional distress and psychological problems in the wake of the harassment. Although there is little evidence that Mota's performance as a teacher and researcher suffered at the time of the harassment, the record does reflect that he came to avoid engagements and conferences at which Caffesse was also present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Indeed, Mota felt compelled to take a leave from his position in the wake of Caffesse's actions. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University further argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider Mota's Title VII harassment claims to the extent that they are based on events occurring in Mexico. The University essentially contends that federal jurisdiction does not lie given the extraterritorial events alleged and the fact that Mota is not a U.S. citizen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo the validity of Mota's Title VII interpretation, subject matter jurisdiction would not be present if the events in Mexico were the sole basis for Mota's harassment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> However, Mota's claim is also supported by alleged acts of harassment in Breckenridge, Houston, Orlando, and Philadelphia. Given the preceding incidents, which occurred in the United States, the University can not demonstrate that Mota's harassment claim is \"wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> As Mota states a potentially viable harassment claim, federal jurisdiction is present.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also challenges the jury's finding that it did not establish affirmative defenses to Mota's harassment claim. Where harassment does not result in a tangible employment action, the defendant may offer the following affirmative defenses: \"(1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any such sexual harassment, and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* A jury could reasonably conclude that the University failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct harassment. The jury could conclude that the panel's failure to discipline Caffesse or take more affirmative steps against him was unreasonable. In this case, the University decided to simply let Mota and Caffesse work out a mutually agreeable accommodation. Although an employer need not use the most serious sanction available to punish an offender,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> the University did not even find that Caffesse had engaged in sexual harassment. Nor did the University issue a reprimand or warning, despite its policy against even consensual sexual relations between supervisors and subordinates. In the past, the school had reprimanded other supervisors who had engaged in consensual relationships with subordinates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> Finally, the University's retaliation against Mota undermines its claim that it was attempting to prevent future harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence also supports the jury's finding that Mota took advantage of available remedies. The University criticizes Mota for not having filed his complaint with the Harassment Board sooner and for failing to disclose tapes of conversations with Caffesse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has not articulated a bright-line test regarding when a delay in filing a complaint becomes \"unreasonable.\" Mota filed his complaint in late April 1997, approximately nine months after the incidents in Mexico and eight months after the events in Philadelphia. Although this Court's jurisprudence indicates that a delay of three months appears not to be excessive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> a delay of eight or nine months is more problematic. However, in light of Caffesse's repeated threats of retaliation, a jury could infer that Mota's delay was not unreasonable. Mota may have believed that resort to the University's administrative process was ineffectual, given Caffesse's influence at the University. According to Mota's testimony, Caffesse told him that the University would protect and defend him against any complaint. Thus, Mota's delay in filing his complaint does not warrant reversing the jury's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could also find that Mota's failure to disclose tape recordings of conversations between him and Caffesse was not unreasonable. Mota fully participated in the investigation, testifying before the panel and providing an extensive written complaint. He may have viewed the production of additional evidence, such as recordings of conversations, as futile, given his concerns over the effectiveness of the panel's inquiry, the composition of the panel, and Caffesse's influence. A jury could have concluded that Mota's actions did not constitute an unreasonable failure to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, a jury could have determined that the University failed to meet its burden of proof in establishing its affirmative defenses. The district court did not err in entering judgment on Mota's sexual harassment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The University contends that the court's award of front pay was an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> Front pay is a form of equitable relief contemplated by Title VII and is intended \"to compensate the plaintiff for lost future wages and benefits.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> \"[F]ront pay may be awarded if reinstatement is not feasible where\" a hostile relationship exists between the employer and the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> Although front pay is an equitable remedy for the district court to determine, the court may empanel an advisory jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the jury's advisory award of $328,565.00 in front pay, the district court took into account the University's post-trial conduct. This was not error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> After initially reducing the jury's recommended award to reflect only ten years of lost future wages, the court added five additional years of front pay based on an email sent by President Low to all 8,000 University employees. The court determined that the email, which Low sent the day after the jury verdict, was the continuation of a pattern of vindictive behavior demonstrated at trial. In the email, Low expressed his disappointment over the jury's finding of retaliation, stating: \"I want to make it very clear that [Mota] was not fired, but rather failed to return to his faculty duties upon expiration of leave that he had requested and was granted by UT-Houston.\" The district court portrayed the email as attempting to \"present Mota in the worst professional light possible.\" The court also concluded that this behavior would impact Mota's future work prospects. On this basis, the court reduced the jury's front pay award to $194,989.00. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also contends that the front pay awarded by the court failed to take into account the fact that, at the time Mota left the University in 1998, he would not have been considered for tenure at the University until he had completed four more years of work. It contends that the court gave Mota a windfall by treating him as if he had tenure by the time he left the University. However, the University does not point to any specific evidence to refute the court's calculations. The court attempted to reconcile the pay disparity between Mota's position at the University and the lower-paying position he was forced to take in Pittsburgh. This was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University further challenges the court's award of attorney's fees. A district court's award of attorney's fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> The University first contends that the fee award was excessive in comparison with fee awards entered in other Title VII cases requiring more time and attention. The University fails to address the court's application of the Johnson factors,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> and makes only a conclusory assertion about comparable awards. The two cases cited by the University involve substantially lower hour totals and billing rates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> The University's failure to object to specific hours worked and the reasonableness of the rates charged renders its argument meritless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University also contends that the court failed to segregate fees incurred through Mota's dispute with Caffesse from those generated by his litigation with the University. The University contends that the majority of discovery disputes were between Mota and Caffesse, who had separate legal counsel. The University accordingly seeks a set-off from the $290,000 in settlement proceeds Mota received from Caffesse's insurers. It argues that the settlement fund presumably compensated Mota's attorneys for their efforts against Caffesse. The University invokes the general presumption against double recovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota urges this Court to uphold the award as a reasonable exercise of the district court's discretion. He contends that the University failed to preserve its objection at the trial level because it did not offer reasons in support of its argument that individual entries were duplicative. This argument fails, however, as Mota concedes that the University pointed out specific items to the trial court. Moreover, \"the burden of proof of reasonableness of the number of hours is on the fee applicant, and not on the opposing party to prove their unreasonableness.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota contends that the award itself was reasonable and not duplicative. Mota's counsel represented to the trial court that they had carefully segregated time spent on the case which was unique to Caffesse. The district court reasonably credited this assertion. The court also found that the majority of claims against Caffesse were \"inextricably intertwined with the claims against the University and that it would be impossible to segregate all of the time for purposes of making a determination of attorney's fees.\" A court need not segregate fees where the facts and issues are so closely interwoven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> Moreover, until the settlement, Caffesse and the University coordinated their defense efforts. The preceding considerations amply support the district court's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mota also refutes the University's suggestion that it receive a credit for the settlement with Caffesse. He points out that cases in which a court awards a settlement credit to a non-settling defendant involve co-defendants liable under the same legal theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a> But Caffesse and the University are not joint tortfeasors, and these cases involve set-offs for liability, not attorney's fees. Even if we were to extend this principle to claims for attorney's fees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a> a set-off would only be justified where the non-settling party demonstrates that it was required to pay for legal work attributable to the settling party. As we have already noted, the University has not made such a showing. The district court's fee award was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The University challenges the court's award of costs to Mota. An award of costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a> The University contends that the district court erred in awarding $3,470.00 for videotaped depositions, $150.46 for an investigation of Caffesse, and a $1,500.00 mediation fee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920, a court may tax the following costs: fees of the clerk and marshal; fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses; fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case; docket fees; compensation of court-appointed experts, interpreters, and special interpretation services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a> The Supreme Court has indicated that federal courts may only award those costs articulated in section 1920 absent explicit statutory or contractual authorization to the contrary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Title VII cases, a district court has an additional source of authority for applying attorney's fees and costs, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(k). This provision empowers the court to \"allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> This Court has interpreted the \"attorney's fee\" allowed by Section 2000e-5(k) to include \"reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the attorney which are normally charged to a fee-paying client, in the course of providing legal services,\" such as postage, photocopying, paralegal services, long distance telephone charges, and travel costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court erred in taxing the University with the cost of videotaped depositions. We have observed that \"28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920(2) only allows for the recovery of '[f]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case.' There is no provision for videotapes of depositions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a> This reading is consistent with the text of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920(2) and the Supreme Court's admonition that we strictly construe this provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a> Nor is it feasible to characterize videotaped depositions as \"out-of-pocket expenses\" similar to postage and long-distance telephone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a> Section 2000e-5(k) therefore lends no support for the court's ruling. As the court abused its discretion, we are compelled to vacate its award of the costs associated with videotaped depositions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the court also erred in taxing the University with the costs of mediation, its award of investigation costs was not an abuse of discretion. Neither category of expenses is within section 1920. We find that section 2000e-5(k) supports the award of investigation fees as a \"reasonable out-of-pocket expense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> However, mediation costs do not fall within the limited category of expenses taxable under Title VII.

The University had ample notice of the basis for a possible hearing request, as Mota noted the implications of the email in three separate pleadings prior to the court's entry of final judgment.

We observed that district courts have discretion to adjust an attorney's fee to allow an injured longshoreman to share in the recovery. We also held that the court's allocation should not allow double recovery where the attorney has already obtained a fee for securing compensation benefits. See id.
