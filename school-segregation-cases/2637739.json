MARGOLIS\n\n                   v.\n\n       SANDY SPRING BANK\n\n\n\n\n   Kehoe,\n   Arthur,\n   Eyler, James R.,\n    (Retired, Specially Assigned),\n\n                  JJ.\n\n\n\n\n         Opinion by Arthur, J.\n\n\n\n\n       Filed: February 26, 2015\n\f       When a bank processes a customer’s ATM and debit-card transactions, it can\n\nproceed in at least two different ways. It can process the transactions in chronological\n\norder, by which it debits the amount of the first transaction first and the last transaction\n\nlast. Or it can engage in what is called “batch-processing,” by which it organizes the\n\ntransactions by dollar amount and then debits the largest transactions first and the smallest\n\ntransactions last. By engaging in batch-processing and processing the largest transactions\n\nfirst, the bank increases the likelihood of overdrafts – and of overdraft fees.\n\n       In this case, Daniel J. Margolis, as the representative of a putative class, brought a\n\nConsumer Protection Act challenge to Sandy Spring Bank’s practice of batch-processing\n\ndebit-card transactions (a.k.a. “point-of-sale” or “POS” transactions) and ATM\n\ntransactions. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County dismissed his complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n                                   Q UESTIONS P RESENTED\n\n       Margolis presents two questions for our review, which we have consolidated and\n\nrephrased as follows: did the trial court err by granting Sandy Spring’s motion to\n\ndismiss?1 For the reasons that follow, we answer in the negative and affirm the judgment\n\n\n\n       1\n           Margolis formulated the questions as follows:\n\n       1.       Did the trial court err in holding that the Maryland Legislature\n                endorsed the bank practice of always reordering debit card\n                transactions from highest amount to lowest amount in order to create\n                more fees for banks when the cited statute does not apply to such\n                transactions?\n\n       2.       Did the trial court err in dismissing Margolis’ claim of an unfair or\n\fof the circuit court.\n\n       A.      The Complaint\n\n       Margolis maintained a checking account with Sandy Spring. The account had\n\noverdraft protection, under which the bank would pay for a transaction despite an\n\noverdraft of available funds, but would charge a fee of $37.00.\n\n       Margolis claimed that he incurred overdraft fees because the bank reordered ATM\n\nand debit-card transactions in his account, debiting the largest transactions first. On June\n\n20, 2013, he filed suit against Sandy Spring, claiming that the bank had committed unfair\n\nand deceptive trade practices in violation of Maryland’s Consumer Protection Act\n\n(“CPA”), Code (1975, 2013 Repl. Vol.), Commercial Law Article (“CL”), § 13-301.2\n\n       The complaint alleged that the bank reorders transactions at the end of each\n\nbusiness day, deducting the largest debits or withdrawals first and continuing thereafter\n\nfrom largest to smallest in descending order. The complaint specifically alleged that\n\nSandy Spring manipulated the order of transactions to increase overdraft fees – and the\n\nresulting profits.\n\n\n\n\n               deceptive trade practice when the Complaint clearly alleged that\n               Sandy Spring wrongfully concealed its practice of always reordering\n               debit transactions to the detriment of consumers, thereby costing its\n               customers substantial sums of money?\n       2\n         Margolis also alleged conversion, but he does not pursue that claim on appeal.\nSee Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, 379 Md. 249, 258 n.3 (2004)\n(collecting cases) (“[a]s a general rule, money, i.e., currency, is not subject to a claim of\nconversion unless the plaintiff seeks to recover specific segregated or identifiable funds”).\n\n                                              2\n\f       By way of example, suppose a Sandy Spring customer’s account contained\n\n$100.00, and the customer used her debit card for a $10.00 transaction, followed by a\n\n$20.00 transaction, and finally a $90.00 transaction. If Sandy Spring processed the\n\ntransactions in chronological order, the customer would overdraw her account only when\n\nshe made the final $90.00 debit, and the bank would charge only a single overdraft fee.\n\nHowever, when the bank batch-processes these same transactions and reorders them from\n\nlargest to smallest, the bank first deducts $90.00, then $20.00, and lastly $10.00. Under\n\nbatch-processing, therefore, the account becomes overdrawn at the second transaction, for\n\n$20, and the customer incurs two overdraft fees.\n\n       In his complaint, Margolis principally alleged that the bank violated the CPA\n\nbecause its Deposit Account Agreement did not disclose, or did not adequately disclose,\n\nthe practice of batch-processing transactions by reordering them from largest to smallest.\n\nHe also alleged that the bank did not adequately inform its customers of their ability to\n\nopt out of overdraft-protection services, under which the bank pays a transaction despite\n\nan overdraft, but charges an overdraft fee. At various points, he also alleged that the bank\n\nprocesses debits before credits. Finally, he alleged that the bank did not adequately\n\nidentify overdraft fees.\n\n       Margolis invoked three provisions of the CPA: section 13-301(2)(i), concerning\n\nrepresentations that “consumer services have a sponsorship, approval, accessory,\n\ncharacteristic, ingredient, use, benefit, or quantity which they do not have”; section\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f13-301(3), concerning the “[f]ailure to state a material fact if the failure deceives or tends\n\nto deceive”; and section 13-301(9)(i), concerning “[d]eception, fraud, false pretense, false\n\npremise, misrepresentation, or knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any\n\nmaterial fact with the intent that a consumer rely on the same in connection with . . . [t]he\n\npromotion or sale of any . . . consumer service.” 3\n\n       B.     The Deposit Account Agreement\n\n       The bank’s Deposit Account Agreement contains a number of provisions that bear\n\non the adequacy of its disclosures.4\n\n       On the subject of overdrafts, the section captioned “Fees for Checks and Other\n\nItems or Incoming Collections” lists the fees that the bank may charge in case of\n\noverdrafts:\n\n       Overdraft, NSF Return or Unavailable Funds (UAF) Overdraft Item: a\n       withdrawal or an order presented for payment that would overdraw an\n       account or is drawn against unavailable funds (fee not applicable to\n       commercial checking UAF items that are paid or returned) $35 per\n\n\n       3\n        Margolis did not invoke section 13-301(1), which concerns a “[f]alse, falsely\ndisparaging, or misleading oral or written statement, visual description, or other\nrepresentation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or\nmisleading consumers.”\n       4\n         Although Margolis did not attach the Deposit Account Agreement to his\ncomplaint, he expressly referred to it and repeatedly alleged that its disclosures did not\nsatisfy the CPA. In response, the bank attached the Deposit Account Agreement to its\nmotion to dismiss. Because there was no dispute that the Deposit Account Agreement\nwas the agreement between Margolis and the bank, the circuit court could and did regard\nit as “simply supplementing the allegations in the complaint.” Smith v. Danielcyzk, 400\nMd. 98, 105 (2007); Tri-County Unlimited, Inc. v. Kids First Swim Sch. Inc., 191 Md.\nApp. 613, 619-20 (2010).\n\n                                              4\n\f          withdrawal or order paid or returned. . . . The types of withdrawals or\n          Orders subject to an overdraft, NSF Return or UAF fee include\n          negotiable orders of withdrawal, checks, substitute checks, electronified\n          checks, “counter/in-person” withdrawals, drafts, ATM withdrawals, point\n          of sale purchases . . . .\n\n          In addition, paragraph 2 of the General Rules of the Deposit Account Agreement\n\nstates:\n\n          We reserve the right at our discretion to pay or refuse to pay any Order\n          executed by you if the balance in the Account is insufficient or uncollected.\n          In either case, we will charge you a fee for each of such Orders to your\n          Account . . . . You may not be notified prior to our payment of any Order\n          that may result in an overdraft . . . .\n\n          On the crucial subject of batch-processing, the Deposit Account Agreement had\n\nthis to say:\n\n          We may accept, pay or charge to your Account your Orders in any\n          order we choose even if (a) paying a particular Order results in an\n          insufficient balance in your Account to pay one or more other Orders that\n          otherwise could have been paid out of your Account; or (b) using a\n          particular order results in the payment of fewer Orders or the imposition\n          of additional fees. In general, we currently process your Orders,\n          including but not limited to ATM and POS transactions and community\n          office withdrawals, at the end of each business day in high to low dollar\n          amount. If there are insufficient funds to cover all of your Orders\n          processed on any given day, this method may result in additional overdraft\n          fees. We may establish different processing priorities or categories for\n          some Orders (i.e., wire transfer requests, automatic loan payments or\n          automatic transfers). We reserve the right to change our policy at any time\n          without notice to you.\n\n          Finally, the Overdraft Disclosure and Confirmation Notice, which is incorporated\n\ninto the Deposit Account Agreement, states:\n\n          At any time if you decide that you no longer want to have our standard\n\n\n                                                5\n\f       overdraft services for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, please\n       contact us . . . .\n\n       On the basis of the disclosures in the Deposit Account Agreement, Sandy Spring\n\nargued, among other things, that the complaint failed to state a claim for unfair and\n\ndeceptive trade practices under the CPA.5\n\n       C.     Motion to Dismiss\n\n       On November 15, 2013, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County held a hearing\n\non Sandy Spring’s motion to dismiss. At the hearing, Sandy Spring argued that it had\n\nfully disclosed its practice of batch-processing and its customer’s right to opt out of\n\noverdraft protection and also that section 4-303(b) of the Uniform Commercial Code,\n\nCode (1975, 2013 Repl. Vol.), § 4-303(b) of the Commercial Law Article (“CL”),\n\nexpressly permitted banks to reorder transactions. The latter argument appeared to\n\nregister with the circuit court, which asked Margolis’s counsel, “[H]asn’t the Maryland\n\nlegislature approved [batch processing] by saying that the bank can order [the\n\ntransactions] or re-order [the transactions] in any order that it wants under the commercial\n\nlaw article that’s cited by the defendants herein?” 6\n\n\n       5\n         Sandy Spring also argued that Margolis had agreed to the overdraft charges and\ncould not predicate a conversion claim upon them; that he had waived any claims for\noverdraft fees; and that limitations barred at least some of his claims. Those arguments\nare not part of the current appeal.\n       6\n        Section 4-403(b) states that “items may,” in general, “be accepted, paid, certified,\nor charged to the indicated account of its customer in any order.” (Emphasis added.) As\ndiscussed below, an “item” is a negotiable instrument, such as a check; ATM withdrawals\nand POS or debit-card transactions are not “items.”\n\n                                               6\n\f       At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted the motion for “the reasons set\n\nforth in [the defendant’s] motion and in [the defendant’s] reply.” The court added:\n\n       [W]hile I may not personally be thrilled about the process or the practice of\n       the bank making all this money at the expense of the customers, it appears\n       to me that the Maryland legislature has, . . . said it’s okay, when they\n       specifically authorized the bank to go ahead and re-order them in any\n       fashion that they want.\n\n       The court issued a written order entered December 11, 2013. The order does not\n\nprovide any additional explanation of the court’s rationale; it incorporates the reasoning\n\n“more fully discussed during the hearing” on November 15, 2013.\n\n       On January 3, 2013, Margolis noted this timely appeal.\n\n                                       D ISCUSSION\n\n       A.     Standard of Review\n\n       In deciding a motion to dismiss a complaint, a circuit court assumes the truth of the\n\ncomplaint’s factual allegations and of any reasonable inferences that can be drawn\n\ntherefrom. See, e.g., Patton v. Wells Fargo Fin. Md., Inc., 437 Md. 83, 95 (2014) (citing\n\nBobo v. State, 346 Md. 706, 708 (1997)). A court, however, need not accept the truth of\n\npure legal conclusions. See, e.g., Shepter v. Johns Hopkins Univ., 334 Md. 82, 103\n\n(1994); John B. Parsons Home, LLC v. John B. Parsons Found., 217 Md. App. 39, 69\n\n(2014) (quoting Shenker v. Laureate Educ., Inc., 411 Md. 317, 335 (2009)) (“‘[m]ere\n\nconclusory charges that are not factual allegations need not be considered’”). Moreover,\n\n“[a]ny ambiguity or uncertainty in the allegations bearing on whether the complaint states\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fa cause of action must be construed against the pleader.” Shenker, 411 Md. at 335; John\n\nB. Parsons, 217 Md. App. at 69.\n\n          A court should dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only if the alleged\n\nfacts and reasonable inferences would fail to afford relief to the plaintiff. Bobo, 346 Md.\n\nat 709.\n\n          This Court conducts a de novo review of the circuit court’s granting of a motion to\n\ndismiss, see Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., 427 Md. 128, 142 (2012), applying the same\n\nstandard as the circuit court and determining whether that decision was legally correct.\n\nSee Reichs Ford Rd. Joint Venture v. State Roads Comm’n, 388 Md. 500, 509 (2005)\n\n(citing Adamson v. Corr. Med. Servs., 359 Md. 238, 246 (2000)). “The appellate court\n\naccords no special deference to the circuit court’s legal conclusions.” Patton, 437 Md. at\n\n95.\n\n          B.     CL § 4-303(b)\n\n          Margolis argues that the circuit court erred in relying on CL section 4-303(b) to\n\nconclude that the General Assembly has authorized batch-processing of electronic debits.\n\nHe argues that section 4-303(b) relates only to tangible negotiable instruments, such as\n\nchecks, and does not apply to the debit and ATM transactions that are at issue in this case.\n\nSandy Spring concedes that section 4-303(b) does not apply to electronic transactions, but\n\nargues that the court’s reliance on the statute amounted to harmless error. We agree that\n\nsection 4-303(b) does not apply to electronic transactions, but also agree that the court’s\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\freliance on the statute was ultimately immaterial.\n\n       Section 4-303(b) provides, in pertinent part, that “items may be accepted, paid,\n\ncertified, or charged to the indicated account of its customer in any order.” This\n\nprovision is a word-for-word adoption of section 4-303(b) of the Uniform Commercial\n\nCode (“U.C.C.”). See U.C.C. § 4-303(b) (2014).7\n\n       Whereas the language of section 4-303(b) seems to bestow discretion on the banks\n\nto use the posting order of their choice, the courts have interpreted Article 4 of the U.C.C.\n\nnot to apply to ATM and debit transactions. See In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig.\n\n(MDL), 694 F. Supp. 2d 1302, 1315 n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (“[t]he banks rely on [section]\n\n4-303(b) of the UCC . . . . The UCC drafters however did not include transactions\n\ninitiated by means of a credit card or debit cards in its endorsement of high-to-low\n\nposting”); Hospicomm, Inc. v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 338 F. Supp. 2d 578, 586 (E.D. Pa. 2004)\n\n(holding that “Article 4 does not contemplate electronic withdrawals”).\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, courts have reasoned that U.C.C. Article 4 applies\n\nonly to an “item,” see, e.g, Hospicomm, 338 F. Supp. 2d at 586; Sinclair Oil Corp. v.\n\nSylvan State Bank, 254 Kan. 836, 843 (1994), which means an “instrument or a promise\n\nor order to pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment.” U.C.C. § 4-\n\n104(a)(9); accord CL § 4-104(a)(9). An “instrument,” in turn, means “a negotiable\n\n\n       7\n         Under section 4-303(b), a bank’s right to accept, pay, certify, or charge the\naccount is subject to the obligation, in section 4-303(a), to honor a stop-payment order,\nlegal process, or a right of setoff exercised by a payor bank.\n\n                                              9\n\finstrument,” see U.C.C. § 3-104(b); CL § 3-104(b); such as a check. By its terms,\n\ntherefore, Article 4 does not apply to electronic-funds transactions, such as ATM\n\nwithdrawals or debit-card or POS purchases. Instead, as other courts have recognized,\n\nelectronic-funds transactions are governed by the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act,\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1693 et seq. See, e.g., Hospicomm, 338 F. Supp. 2d at 586.8\n\n       Nonetheless, because the circuit court’s reliance on section 4-303(b) was in the\n\nnature of an alternative holding, the error does not require reversal unless the court also\n\nerred in holding that Margolis failed to allege violations of the CPA. Cf. Schneider v.\n\nLittle, 206 Md. App. 414, 443 (2012), rev’d on other grounds, 434 Md. 150 (2013)\n\n(quoting Barksdale v. Wilkowsky, 419 Md. 649, 657 (2011)) (“‘[i]t has long been the\n\npolicy in this state that [appellate courts] will not reverse a lower court judgment if the\n\nerror is harmless’”).\n\n       C.     The Consumer Protection Act\n\n       Maryland’s CPA, CL section 13-303, proscribes businesses, including banks, from\n\nengaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices, as defined in CL section 13-301.\n\nMargolis argues that the circuit court erred by dismissing his CPA claim because, he says,\n\nhis complaint sufficiently alleged that Sandy Spring violated the CPA by engaging in\n\n\n\n       8\n         Although Article 4A of the U.C.C. concerns electronic transactions, it applies\nonly to fund transfers to banks, such as wire transfers (see U.C.C. § 4A-104; CL § 4A-\n104); it does not apply to ATM withdrawals by a consumer or to debit-card or POS\npayments to a merchant.\n\n                                              10\n\funfair or deceptive trade practices. Sandy Spring responds that it adequately disclosed its\n\noverdraft policies to its customers and therefore that the circuit court properly dismissed\n\nthe CPA claim.\n\n       Margolis identifies a number of banking practices that, in his view, violate the\n\nCPA:\n\n       •      reordering transactions from high to low;\n\n       •      charging overdraft fees when accounts had a positive balance;\n\n       •      reordering multiple days’ worth of transactions;\n\n       •      preventing customers from ascertaining their actual account balances;\n\n       •      charging fees which far exceed the amount by which an account is\n\n              overdrawn and which are not reasonably related to Sandy Spring’s cost of\n\n              covering the overdraft;\n\n       •      failing to obtain customer consent before processing debit transactions\n\n              which overdraw customer accounts; and\n\n       •      failing to notify customers of their ability to opt-out of overdraft services\n\n              and related fees.\n\n       In addition, at various points, Margolis alleges that the bank processes credits\n\nbefore debits, although he does not clearly claim to have suffered damages as a result of\n\nthat alleged practice.\n\n       Because Margolis’s CPA claims allege material misstatements or omissions in the\n\n\n                                             11\n\fDeposit Account Agreement, the language of that document is of paramount importance.\n\nMargolis can state a claim only if the agreement contains a false representation under\n\nsection 13-301(2)(i) (i.e., a “representation” that the bank’s services “have a . . .\n\ncharacteristic which they do not have”); the “[f]ailure to state a material fact” under\n\nsection 13-301(3); or “[d]eception, fraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation,\n\nor knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact,” under section\n\n13-301(9).9\n\n       Our examination of the language of the agreement leads us to conclude that\n\nMargolis did not sufficiently allege that the bank engaged in an unfair or deceptive trade\n\npractice in contravention of the Act.\n\n                     1. Reordering Transactions from High to Low\n\n       Margolis predicates a CPA violation on what he calls the bank’s alleged\n\n“concealment” of its practice of batch-processing. Yet, the Deposit Account Agreement\n\nplainly provides that, “[i]n general,” the bank “currently process[es] [a customer’s]\n\nOrders, including but not limited to ATM and POS transactions . . . at the end of each\n\nbusiness day in high to low dollar amount.” In view of that explicit disclosure, there is\n\nsimply no factual basis for the allegation that the bank somehow concealed its practice of\n\nbatch-processing ATM and POS transactions “in high to low dollar amount.” See Hassler\n\n\n       9\n        Margolis frequently focuses on the fairness of the bank’s practices rather than on\nwhat the bank said (or failed to say) about them. Under the CPA claims that he has\nattempted to allege, however, we are concerned only with the bank’s representations or\nmaterial omissions.\n\n                                              12\n\fv. Sovereign Bank, 644 F. Supp. 2d 509, 515-16 (D.N.J. 2009), aff’d, 374 Fed. Appx. 341\n\n(3d Cir. 2010) (rejecting challenge to batch-processing under New Jersey Consumer\n\nFraud Act because agreement contained very information plaintiff alleged to have been\n\nmisrepresented, suppressed, or concealed).\n\n       Margolis counters that the agreement is still misleading because the document\n\nstates that Sandy Spring “general[ly]” processes the largest transactions first, while he\n\nclaims that Sandy Spring “always” processes those transactions first. From the standpoint\n\nof disclosure under the CPA, we see this as an immaterial distinction without a\n\ndifference. See Golt v. Phillips, 308 Md. 1, 10 (1986) (stating that “an omission is\n\nconsidered material if a significant number of unsophisticated consumers would attach\n\nimportance to the information in determining a choice of action”); see also Luskin’s, Inc.\n\nv. Consumer Protection Div’n, 353 Md. 335, 358-59 (1999) (holding that under the CPA\n\nmateriality information that is important to customers and, hence, likely to affect their\n\nchoices). If customers have been informed that “in general” their bank “currently”\n\nprocesses the largest ATM or POS transactions before the smaller ones, as Sandy\n\nSpring’s customers have, they are exceedingly unlikely to risk an overdraft in the hope\n\nthat in that given instance the bank might depart from its “general,” “current[]” method of\n\ncalculating whether their accounts are overdrawn.\n\n       Finally, Margolis cites a number of out-of-state cases in which federal courts have\n\ndenied motions to dismiss challenges to batch-processing. None of those cases, however,\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\finvolves a misrepresentation-based claim, like Margolis’s, under a statute like the CPA.\n\nInstead, the cases typically involve theories of good faith and fair dealing or\n\nunconscionability. See, e.g., In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., 883 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1244 (S.D. Fla. 2012); Hughes v. TD Bank, N.A., 856 F. Supp. 2d 673 (D.N.J. 2012); In\n\nre Checking Account Overdraft Litig., 694 F. Supp. 2d 1302 (S.D. Fla. 2010); White v.\n\nWachovia Bank, N.A., 563 F. Supp. 2d 1358 (N.D. Ga. 2008). Indeed, even where those\n\ncases discuss whether the defendant did something that was “misleading,” they speak of\n\nthe amorphous concept of misleading practices, see Hughes, 856 F. Supp. 2d at 679-80;\n\nIn re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., 694 F. Supp. 2d at 1325; White, 563 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 1369-70; not the misleading representations that Margolis’s CPA claim alleges. In\n\nshort, the out-of-state cases afford no support for Margolis’s allegation that Sandy Spring\n\nviolated the CPA by “conceal[ing]” its practice of batch-processing ATM and POS\n\ntransactions.10\n\n                  2. Charging Fees on Accounts with Positive Balances\n\n       Margolis repeatedly asserts that Sandy Spring charges overdraft fees on accounts\n\nthat have positive balances. Upon examination, however, Margolis really means only that\n\nthe bank charges overdraft fees on accounts that would have had positive balances had\n\n\n\n       10\n         Both parties cite a number of unreported federal decisions concerning the\npropriety of batch-processing under the law of various states. “However, it is the policy\nof this Court in its opinions not to cite for persuasive value any unreported federal or state\ncourt opinion.” Kendall v. Howard County, 204 Md. App. 440, 445 n.1 (2012), aff’d, 431\nMd. 590 (2013).\n\n                                              14\n\fthe bank processed the transactions in chronological order – i.e., that the bank charges\n\noverdraft fees on accounts that would have had positive balances had the bank not\n\nengaged in batch-processing and not debited the largest transactions first. Viewed in this\n\nway, this assertion is merely a variation of Margolis’s allegation that batch-processing\n\nviolates the CPA. Because we have concluded that the bank adequately disclosed its\n\npractice of batch-processing ATM and POS transactions, we reject Margolis’s\n\ncontentions concerning the alleged practice of charging fees on accounts with positive\n\nbalances.\n\n                 3. Reordering Multiple Days’ Worth of Transactions\n\n       In the paragraph concerning batch-processing, the Deposit Account Agreement\n\nexpressly states that, “[i]n general,” the bank processes ATM and POS transactions “at\n\nthe end of each business day.” There is no ambiguity about what a “business day” means,\n\nnor is there any question that Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are not “business days.”\n\nHence, the agreement adequately discloses that the bank generally waits until the end of\n\nthe first business day after a weekend or holiday before processing the transactions that\n\nhave occurred during that period. Because the agreement also discloses that the bank\n\ngenerally processes the transaction “in high to low dollar amount,” it adequately discloses\n\nthe practice of aggregating ATM and POS transactions over a weekend or holiday and\n\nbatch-processing them by debiting the largest of the transactions first.\n\n                 4. Preventing Customers from Ascertaining Balances\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       Margolis appears to allege that the bank misinforms its customers about their\n\naccount balances if they check their balances before the bank has batch-processed the\n\ntransactions in the account at the end of the “business day.” The short answer is that, in\n\nview of the bank’s disclosures, a reasonable customer would understand that it is\n\nimpossible to ascertain the precise account balance until after “the end of each business\n\nday.” Because the bank clearly discloses that it “general[ly]” does not process\n\ntransactions in chronological order but rather in “high to low dollar amount,” and that it\n\nreserves the right to process the transactions “in any order” that it chooses even if its\n\nchoice results in an overdraft and additional fees, a reasonable customer would\n\nunderstand that he or she can receive only a provisional disclosure regarding the account\n\nbalance before the end of the business day.\n\n                          5. Charging Excessive Overdraft Fees\n\n       In the section of the Deposit Account Agreement captioned “Fees for Checks and\n\nOther Items or Incoming Collections,” Sandy Spring discloses the precise amount of the\n\nfee that it charges for overdrafts. The bank does not represent that the fee relates in any\n\nway to the cost of covering the overdraft. Nor does the bank represent that the fee will\n\nbear some relationship to the amount of the overdraft. Rather, it discloses that it will\n\ncharge a flat fee regardless of the size of the overdraft. In these circumstances, Margolis\n\nhas presented no ground to support a misrepresentation-based claim under the CPA for\n\nthe imposition of excessive overdraft fees.\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f                         6. Failure to Disclose Ability to Opt Out\n\n       Margolis complains that the bank does not notify customers of their ability to opt-\n\nout of the overdraft services and related overdraft fees. To the contrary, the Overdraft\n\nDisclosure and Confirmation Notice expressly advises customers to contact the bank “[a]t\n\nany time if you decide that you no longer want to have our standard overdraft services for\n\nATM and one-time debit card transactions.” In view of that disclosure, Margolis has no\n\nfactual basis for his CPA claim based on an alleged failure to disclose the ability to opt\n\nout.\n\n                            7. Processing Debits Before Credits\n\n       The Deposit Account Agreement states that the bank may “accept, pay or charge\n\n. . . Orders in any order we choose even if (a) paying a particular Order results in an\n\ninsufficient balance . . . or (b) using a particular order results in . . . the imposition of\n\nadditional fees.” (Emphasis added.) The definition of “Order,” however, does not\n\ninclude “Deposits.” To the contrary, the term “Deposits” has its own definition, separate\n\nfrom the definition of “Orders.” Accordingly, the agreement does not authorize the bank\n\nto “accept, pay or charge” deposits in any order it chooses. In fact, the agreement states\n\nthat deposits “will be posted before Orders.”\n\n       Margolis’s complaint includes a single, passing allegation about being assessed\n\nfees, in an undisclosed amount, because the bank processes debits before credits. The\n\nallegation, which appears in paragraph 30, reads as follows:\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f              Plaintiff (i) maintained an account with Sandy Spring; (ii) initiated multiple\n       electronic funds transfers with an ATM or debit card issued by Defendant; and (iii)\n       was actually assessed one or more overdraft fees or charges for an ATM or one-\n       time debit card transaction as a result of Sandy Spring’s practice of holding debit\n       card transactions, resequencing the transactions from highest to lowest, and\n       processing debits before credits.\n\n       This allegation does not appear in the section concerning damages or harm, but in\n\nthe section concerning Margolis’s adequacy as a class representative. Moreover, the\n\nallegation does not unambiguously state that the bank actually assessed any fees against\n\nhim solely because it had processed debits before credits. Instead, Margolis seems to\n\nallege that he incurred fees because of some combination of multiple factors: the bank’s\n\npractice of holding debit-card transactions (apparently until the end of a business day); of\n\nreordering the transactions from highest to lowest; and of processing debits before credits.\n\nIndeed, the focus of Margolis’s complaint (and his brief to this Court) was on batch-\n\nprocessing; processing debits before credits was less than an afterthought. Margolis said\n\nnothing about processing debits before credits even though the bank’s disclosures said\n\nnothing about it.\n\n       In these circumstances, Margolis has not satisfied the “‘stringent requirements of\n\nMaryland Rule 2-305,’” Shepter, 334 Md. at 104 (quoting P. Sandler & J. Archibald,\n\nPleading Causes of Action in Maryland, § 1.1, at 2 (1st ed. 1991)), under which a\n\ncomplaint must “contain a clear statement of the facts necessary to constitute a cause of\n\naction.” Md. Rule 2-305. Simple notice pleading does not suffice. Shepter, 334 Md. at\n\n104.\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       In view of the absence of factual allegations, as opposed to ambiguous conclusory\n\nassertions, in the complaint, Margolis failed to state a claim concerning the bank’s alleged\n\npractice of processing debits before credits. Polek v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 424\n\nMd. 333, 365 (2012) (affirming dismissal of complaint where plaintiffs did not\n\nsufficiently allege that they suffered actual injury because of CPA violation).11\n\n       D.     The Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n       Although Margolis did not assert a claim for breach of contract, he frequently\n\nrefers to Sandy Spring’s implied contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nThose references typically occur in connection with his citation of federal trial court\n\ndecisions that interpret the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the law\n\nof states other than Maryland. Those cases typically state that, where a bank has the\n\ncontractual right to exercise discretion in ordering ATM and POS transactions, it must\n\n\n\n       11\n          Even if Margolis had alleged a misrepresentation or material omission sufficient\nto trigger liability under the CPA, he would not have stated a claim under section 13-\n301(9). That subsection “replicates common-law fraud insofar as it includes ‘[d]eception,\nfraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation, or knowing concealment,\nsuppression, or omission of any material fact with the intent that a consumer rely on the\nsame in connection with . . . [t]he promotion or sale of any consumer goods. . . .’”\nMcCormick v. Medtronic, Inc., 219 Md. App. 485, 529 (2014) (quoting CL § 13-301(9)).\n“Accordingly, if a party alleges an ‘unfair or deceptive trade practice’ under that specific\nsubsection, he or she must allege fraud with particularity[.]” Id. Among other things, the\nrequirement of particularity means that a plaintiff must allege “why a finder of fact would\nhave reason to conclude that the defendant acted with scienter (i.e., that the defendant\neither knew that the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth) and\nwith the intention to persuade others to rely on the false statement).” Id. Because the\ncomplaint makes no effort to plead this aspect of fraud with anything resembling\nparticularity, it does not state a claim for a violation of section 13-301(9).\n\n                                             19\n\fexercise its discretion in good faith. See, e.g., In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig.,\n\n694 F. Supp. 2d at 1315.\n\n       Under Maryland law, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing ordinarily\n\nimposes no affirmative obligations outside the express terms of the contract itself. See\n\nPolek, 424 Md. at 363; see also Blondell v. Littlepage, 413 Md. 96, 113 (2010) (implied\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing generally “concerns the ‘performance and\n\nenforcement’ of the contract itself”). Hence, even if Margolis had alleged a breach of\n\ncontract, which he did not do, it is difficult to envision how the implied covenant would\n\nadvance his case, as he did not charge the bank with doing anything other than what it had\n\nthe express contractual right to do. See Blondell, 413 Md. at 114-15.\n\n       In any event, the implied covenant has no real bearing on Margolis’s CPA claim,\n\nbecause that claim turns on whether the bank made false representations or failed to\n\ndisclose material facts. Because we hold that the complaint did not adequately allege\n\nfalse representations or material omissions in violation of the CPA, we affirm the circuit\n\ncourt’s decision to dismiss it with prejudice.\n\n                                        C ONCLUSION\n\n       In affirming the dismissal of Margolis’s CPA claim, we should not be understood\n\nto have endorsed the bank’s practice of maximizing fees by reordering transactions to\n\ncreate overdrafts where they would not otherwise exist. We hold only that the Margolis’s\n\nallegations did not suffice to state a claim that the bank “concealed” its practices in\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fviolation of the CPA. Sandy Spring adequately disclosed those practices, and Margolis\n\nwas free to reject its services and to look for another bank with less onerous overdraft\n\npolicies if he so chose.\n\n                                                  JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT\n                                                  COURT FOR MONTGOMERY\n                                                  COUNTY AFFIRMED.

MARGOLIS\n\n                   v.\n\n       SANDY SPRING BANK\n\n\n\n\n   Kehoe,\n   Arthur,\n   Eyler, James R.,\n    (Retired, Specially Assigned),\n\n                  JJ.\n\n\n\n\n         Opinion by Arthur, J.\n\n\n\n\n       Filed: February 26, 2015\n\f       When a bank processes a customer’s ATM and debit-card transactions, it can\n\nproceed in at least two different ways. It can process the transactions in chronological\n\norder, by which it debits the amount of the first transaction first and the last transaction\n\nlast. Or it can engage in what is called “batch-processing,” by which it organizes the\n\ntransactions by dollar amount and then debits the largest transactions first and the smallest\n\ntransactions last. By engaging in batch-processing and processing the largest transactions\n\nfirst, the bank increases the likelihood of overdrafts – and of overdraft fees.\n\n       In this case, Daniel J. Margolis, as the representative of a putative class, brought a\n\nConsumer Protection Act challenge to Sandy Spring Bank’s practice of batch-processing\n\ndebit-card transactions (a.k.a. “point-of-sale” or “POS” transactions) and ATM\n\ntransactions. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County dismissed his complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n                                   Q UESTIONS P RESENTED\n\n       Margolis presents two questions for our review, which we have consolidated and\n\nrephrased as follows: did the trial court err by granting Sandy Spring’s motion to\n\ndismiss?1 For the reasons that follow, we answer in the negative and affirm the judgment\n\n\n\n       1\n           Margolis formulated the questions as follows:\n\n       1.       Did the trial court err in holding that the Maryland Legislature\n                endorsed the bank practice of always reordering debit card\n                transactions from highest amount to lowest amount in order to create\n                more fees for banks when the cited statute does not apply to such\n                transactions?\n\n       2.       Did the trial court err in dismissing Margolis’ claim of an unfair or\n\fof the circuit court.\n\n       A.      The Complaint\n\n       Margolis maintained a checking account with Sandy Spring. The account had\n\noverdraft protection, under which the bank would pay for a transaction despite an\n\noverdraft of available funds, but would charge a fee of $37.00.\n\n       Margolis claimed that he incurred overdraft fees because the bank reordered ATM\n\nand debit-card transactions in his account, debiting the largest transactions first. On June\n\n20, 2013, he filed suit against Sandy Spring, claiming that the bank had committed unfair\n\nand deceptive trade practices in violation of Maryland’s Consumer Protection Act\n\n(“CPA”), Code (1975, 2013 Repl. Vol.), Commercial Law Article (“CL”), § 13-301.2\n\n       The complaint alleged that the bank reorders transactions at the end of each\n\nbusiness day, deducting the largest debits or withdrawals first and continuing thereafter\n\nfrom largest to smallest in descending order. The complaint specifically alleged that\n\nSandy Spring manipulated the order of transactions to increase overdraft fees – and the\n\nresulting profits.\n\n\n\n\n               deceptive trade practice when the Complaint clearly alleged that\n               Sandy Spring wrongfully concealed its practice of always reordering\n               debit transactions to the detriment of consumers, thereby costing its\n               customers substantial sums of money?\n       2\n         Margolis also alleged conversion, but he does not pursue that claim on appeal.\nSee Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1967510\"><a href=\"/opinion/1967510/darcars-v-borzym/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 n.3 (2004)\n(collecting cases) (“[a]s a general rule, money, i.e., currency, is not subject to a claim of\nconversion unless the plaintiff seeks to recover specific segregated or identifiable funds”).\n\n                                              2\n\f       By way of example, suppose a Sandy Spring customer’s account contained\n\n$100.00, and the customer used her debit card for a $10.00 transaction, followed by a\n\n$20.00 transaction, and finally a $90.00 transaction. If Sandy Spring processed the\n\ntransactions in chronological order, the customer would overdraw her account only when\n\nshe made the final $90.00 debit, and the bank would charge only a single overdraft fee.\n\nHowever, when the bank batch-processes these same transactions and reorders them from\n\nlargest to smallest, the bank first deducts $90.00, then $20.00, and lastly $10.00. Under\n\nbatch-processing, therefore, the account becomes overdrawn at the second transaction, for\n\n$20, and the customer incurs two overdraft fees.\n\n       In his complaint, Margolis principally alleged that the bank violated the CPA\n\nbecause its Deposit Account Agreement did not disclose, or did not adequately disclose,\n\nthe practice of batch-processing transactions by reordering them from largest to smallest.\n\nHe also alleged that the bank did not adequately inform its customers of their ability to\n\nopt out of overdraft-protection services, under which the bank pays a transaction despite\n\nan overdraft, but charges an overdraft fee. At various points, he also alleged that the bank\n\nprocesses debits before credits. Finally, he alleged that the bank did not adequately\n\nidentify overdraft fees.\n\n       Margolis invoked three provisions of the CPA: section 13-301(2)(i), concerning\n\nrepresentations that “consumer services have a sponsorship, approval, accessory,\n\ncharacteristic, ingredient, use, benefit, or quantity which they do not have”; section\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f13-301(3), concerning the “[f]ailure to state a material fact if the failure deceives or tends\n\nto deceive”; and section 13-301(9)(i), concerning “[d]eception, fraud, false pretense, false\n\npremise, misrepresentation, or knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any\n\nmaterial fact with the intent that a consumer rely on the same in connection with . . . [t]he\n\npromotion or sale of any . . . consumer service.” 3\n\n       B.     The Deposit Account Agreement\n\n       The bank’s Deposit Account Agreement contains a number of provisions that bear\n\non the adequacy of its disclosures.4\n\n       On the subject of overdrafts, the section captioned “Fees for Checks and Other\n\nItems or Incoming Collections” lists the fees that the bank may charge in case of\n\noverdrafts:\n\n       Overdraft, NSF Return or Unavailable Funds (UAF) Overdraft Item: a\n       withdrawal or an order presented for payment that would overdraw an\n       account or is drawn against unavailable funds (fee not applicable to\n       commercial checking UAF items that are paid or returned) $35 per\n\n\n       3\n        Margolis did not invoke section 13-301(1), which concerns a “[f]alse, falsely\ndisparaging, or misleading oral or written statement, visual description, or other\nrepresentation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or\nmisleading consumers.”\n       4\n         Although Margolis did not attach the Deposit Account Agreement to his\ncomplaint, he expressly referred to it and repeatedly alleged that its disclosures did not\nsatisfy the CPA. In response, the bank attached the Deposit Account Agreement to its\nmotion to dismiss. Because there was no dispute that the Deposit Account Agreement\nwas the agreement between Margolis and the bank, the circuit court could and did regard\nit as “simply supplementing the allegations in the complaint.” Smith v.

Motion to Dismiss\n\n       On November 15, 2013, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County held a hearing\n\non Sandy Spring’s motion to dismiss. At the hearing, Sandy Spring argued that it had\n\nfully disclosed its practice of batch-processing and its customer’s right to opt out of\n\noverdraft protection and also that section 4-303(b) of the Uniform Commercial Code,\n\nCode (1975, 2013 Repl. Vol.), § 4-303(b) of the Commercial Law Article (“CL”),\n\nexpressly permitted banks to reorder transactions. The latter argument appeared to\n\nregister with the circuit court, which asked Margolis’s counsel, “[H]asn’t the Maryland\n\nlegislature approved [batch processing] by saying that the bank can order [the\n\ntransactions] or re-order [the transactions] in any order that it wants under the commercial\n\nlaw article that’s cited by the defendants herein?” 6\n\n\n       5\n         Sandy Spring also argued that Margolis had agreed to the overdraft charges and\ncould not predicate a conversion claim upon them; that he had waived any claims for\noverdraft fees; and that limitations barred at least some of his claims. Those arguments\nare not part of the current appeal.\n       6\n        Section 4-403(b) states that “items may,” in general, “be accepted, paid, certified,\nor charged to the indicated account of its customer in any order.” (Emphasis added.) As\ndiscussed below, an “item” is a negotiable instrument, such as a check; ATM withdrawals\nand POS or debit-card transactions are not “items.”\n\n                                               6\n\f       At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted the motion for “the reasons set\n\nforth in [the defendant’s] motion and in [the defendant’s] reply.” The court added:\n\n       [W]hile I may not personally be thrilled about the process or the practice of\n       the bank making all this money at the expense of the customers, it appears\n       to me that the Maryland legislature has, . . . said it’s okay, when they\n       specifically authorized the bank to go ahead and re-order them in any\n       fashion that they want.\n\n       The court issued a written order entered December 11, 2013. The order does not\n\nprovide any additional explanation of the court’s rationale; it incorporates the reasoning\n\n“more fully discussed during the hearing” on November 15, 2013.\n\n       On January 3, 2013, Margolis noted this timely appeal.\n\n                                       D ISCUSSION\n\n       A.

We agree that\n\nsection 4-303(b) does not apply to electronic transactions, but also agree that the court’s\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\freliance on the statute was ultimately immaterial.\n\n       Section 4-303(b) provides, in pertinent part, that “items may be accepted, paid,\n\ncertified, or charged to the indicated account of its customer in any order.” This\n\nprovision is a word-for-word adoption of section 4-303(b) of the Uniform Commercial\n\nCode (“U.C.C.”).

An “instrument,” in turn, means “a negotiable\n\n\n       7\n         Under section 4-303(b), a bank’s right to accept, pay, certify, or charge the\naccount is subject to the obligation, in section 4-303(a), to honor a stop-payment order,\nlegal process, or a right of setoff exercised by a payor bank.\n\n                                              9\n\finstrument,” see U.C.C. § 3-104(b); CL § 3-104(b); such as a check.

The Consumer Protection Act\n\n       Maryland’s CPA, CL section 13-303, proscribes businesses, including banks, from\n\nengaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices, as defined in CL section 13-301.\n\nMargolis argues that the circuit court erred by dismissing his CPA claim because, he says,\n\nhis complaint sufficiently alleged that Sandy Spring violated the CPA by engaging in\n\n\n\n       8\n         Although Article 4A of the U.C.C. concerns electronic transactions, it applies\nonly to fund transfers to banks, such as wire transfers (see U.C.C. § 4A-104; CL § 4A-\n104); it does not apply to ATM withdrawals by a consumer or to debit-card or POS\npayments to a merchant.\n\n                                              10\n\funfair or deceptive trade practices. Sandy Spring responds that it adequately disclosed its\n\noverdraft policies to its customers and therefore that the circuit court properly dismissed\n\nthe CPA claim.\n\n       Margolis identifies a number of banking practices that, in his view, violate the\n\nCPA:\n\n       •      reordering transactions from high to low;\n\n       •      charging overdraft fees when accounts had a positive balance;\n\n       •      reordering multiple days’ worth of transactions;\n\n       •      preventing customers from ascertaining their actual account balances;\n\n       •      charging fees which far exceed the amount by which an account is\n\n              overdrawn and which are not reasonably related to Sandy Spring’s cost of\n\n              covering the overdraft;\n\n       •      failing to obtain customer consent before processing debit transactions\n\n              which overdraw customer accounts; and\n\n       •      failing to notify customers of their ability to opt-out of overdraft services\n\n              and related fees.\n\n       In addition, at various points, Margolis alleges that the bank processes credits\n\nbefore debits, although he does not clearly claim to have suffered damages as a result of\n\nthat alleged practice.\n\n       Because Margolis’s CPA claims allege material misstatements or omissions in the\n\n\n                                             11\n\fDeposit Account Agreement, the language of that document is of paramount importance.\n\nMargolis can state a claim only if the agreement contains a false representation under\n\nsection 13-301(2)(i) (i.e., a “representation” that the bank’s services “have a . . .\n\ncharacteristic which they do not have”); the “[f]ailure to state a material fact” under\n\nsection 13-301(3); or “[d]eception, fraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation,\n\nor knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact,” under section\n\n13-301(9).9\n\n       Our examination of the language of the agreement leads us to conclude that\n\nMargolis did not sufficiently allege that the bank engaged in an unfair or deceptive trade\n\npractice in contravention of the Act.\n\n                     1. Reordering Transactions from High to Low\n\n       Margolis predicates a CPA violation on what he calls the bank’s alleged\n\n“concealment” of its practice of batch-processing. Yet, the Deposit Account Agreement\n\nplainly provides that, “[i]n general,” the bank “currently process[es] [a customer’s]\n\nOrders, including but not limited to ATM and POS transactions . . . at the end of each\n\nbusiness day in high to low dollar amount.” In view of that explicit disclosure, there is\n\nsimply no factual basis for the allegation that the bank somehow concealed its practice of\n\nbatch-processing ATM and POS transactions “in high to low dollar amount.” See Hassler\n\n\n       9\n        Margolis frequently focuses on the fairness of the bank’s practices rather than on\nwhat the bank said (or failed to say) about them. Under the CPA claims that he has\nattempted to allege, however, we are concerned only with the bank’s representations or\nmaterial omissions.\n\n                                              12\n\fv.

If customers have been informed that “in general” their bank “currently”\n\nprocesses the largest ATM or POS transactions before the smaller ones, as Sandy\n\nSpring’s customers have, they are exceedingly unlikely to risk an overdraft in the hope\n\nthat in that given instance the bank might depart from its “general,” “current[]” method of\n\ncalculating whether their accounts are overdrawn.\n\n       Finally, Margolis cites a number of out-of-state cases in which federal courts have\n\ndenied motions to dismiss challenges to batch-processing.

Indeed, even where those\n\ncases discuss whether the defendant did something that was “misleading,” they speak of\n\nthe amorphous concept of misleading practices, see Hughes, 856 F. Supp. 2d at 679-80;\n\nIn re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., 694 F. Supp. 2d at 1325; White, 563 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 1369-70; not the misleading representations that Margolis’s CPA claim alleges. In\n\nshort, the out-of-state cases afford no support for Margolis’s allegation that Sandy Spring\n\nviolated the CPA by “conceal[ing]” its practice of batch-processing ATM and POS\n\ntransactions.10\n\n                  2. Charging Fees on Accounts with Positive Balances\n\n       Margolis repeatedly asserts that Sandy Spring charges overdraft fees on accounts\n\nthat have positive balances. Upon examination, however, Margolis really means only that\n\nthe bank charges overdraft fees on accounts that would have had positive balances had\n\n\n\n       10\n         Both parties cite a number of unreported federal decisions concerning the\npropriety of batch-processing under the law of various states. “However, it is the policy\nof this Court in its opinions not to cite for persuasive value any unreported federal or state\ncourt opinion.” Kendall v. Howard County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2294581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2294581/kendall-v-howard-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445 n.1 (2012), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013).\n\n                                              14\n\fthe bank processed the transactions in chronological order – i.e., that the bank charges\n\noverdraft fees on accounts that would have had positive balances had the bank not\n\nengaged in batch-processing and not debited the largest transactions first. Viewed in this\n\nway, this assertion is merely a variation of Margolis’s allegation that batch-processing\n\nviolates the CPA. Because we have concluded that the bank adequately disclosed its\n\npractice of batch-processing ATM and POS transactions, we reject Margolis’s\n\ncontentions concerning the alleged practice of charging fees on accounts with positive\n\nbalances.\n\n                 3. Reordering Multiple Days’ Worth of Transactions\n\n       In the paragraph concerning batch-processing, the Deposit Account Agreement\n\nexpressly states that, “[i]n general,” the bank processes ATM and POS transactions “at\n\nthe end of each business day.” There is no ambiguity about what a “business day” means,\n\nnor is there any question that Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are not “business days.”\n\nHence, the agreement adequately discloses that the bank generally waits until the end of\n\nthe first business day after a weekend or holiday before processing the transactions that\n\nhave occurred during that period. Because the agreement also discloses that the bank\n\ngenerally processes the transaction “in high to low dollar amount,” it adequately discloses\n\nthe practice of aggregating ATM and POS transactions over a weekend or holiday and\n\nbatch-processing them by debiting the largest of the transactions first.\n\n                 4. Preventing Customers from Ascertaining Balances\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       Margolis appears to allege that the bank misinforms its customers about their\n\naccount balances if they check their balances before the bank has batch-processed the\n\ntransactions in the account at the end of the “business day.” The short answer is that, in\n\nview of the bank’s disclosures, a reasonable customer would understand that it is\n\nimpossible to ascertain the precise account balance until after “the end of each business\n\nday.” Because the bank clearly discloses that it “general[ly]” does not process\n\ntransactions in chronological order but rather in “high to low dollar amount,” and that it\n\nreserves the right to process the transactions “in any order” that it chooses even if its\n\nchoice results in an overdraft and additional fees, a reasonable customer would\n\nunderstand that he or she can receive only a provisional disclosure regarding the account\n\nbalance before the end of the business day.\n\n                          5. Charging Excessive Overdraft Fees\n\n       In the section of the Deposit Account Agreement captioned “Fees for Checks and\n\nOther Items or Incoming Collections,” Sandy Spring discloses the precise amount of the\n\nfee that it charges for overdrafts. The bank does not represent that the fee relates in any\n\nway to the cost of covering the overdraft. Nor does the bank represent that the fee will\n\nbear some relationship to the amount of the overdraft. Rather, it discloses that it will\n\ncharge a flat fee regardless of the size of the overdraft. In these circumstances, Margolis\n\nhas presented no ground to support a misrepresentation-based claim under the CPA for\n\nthe imposition of excessive overdraft fees.\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f                         6. Failure to Disclose Ability to Opt Out\n\n       Margolis complains that the bank does not notify customers of their ability to opt-\n\nout of the overdraft services and related overdraft fees. To the contrary, the Overdraft\n\nDisclosure and Confirmation Notice expressly advises customers to contact the bank “[a]t\n\nany time if you decide that you no longer want to have our standard overdraft services for\n\nATM and one-time debit card transactions.” In view of that disclosure, Margolis has no\n\nfactual basis for his CPA claim based on an alleged failure to disclose the ability to opt\n\nout.\n\n                            7. Processing Debits Before Credits\n\n       The Deposit Account Agreement states that the bank may “accept, pay or charge\n\n. . . Orders in any order we choose even if (a) paying a particular Order results in an\n\ninsufficient balance . . . or (b) using a particular order results in . . . the imposition of\n\nadditional fees.” (Emphasis added.) The definition of “Order,” however, does not\n\ninclude “Deposits.” To the contrary, the term “Deposits” has its own definition, separate\n\nfrom the definition of “Orders.” Accordingly, the agreement does not authorize the bank\n\nto “accept, pay or charge” deposits in any order it chooses. In fact, the agreement states\n\nthat deposits “will be posted before Orders.”\n\n       Margolis’s complaint includes a single, passing allegation about being assessed\n\nfees, in an undisclosed amount, because the bank processes debits before credits. The\n\nallegation, which appears in paragraph 30, reads as follows:\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f              Plaintiff (i) maintained an account with Sandy Spring; (ii) initiated multiple\n       electronic funds transfers with an ATM or debit card issued by Defendant; and (iii)\n       was actually assessed one or more overdraft fees or charges for an ATM or one-\n       time debit card transaction as a result of Sandy Spring’s practice of holding debit\n       card transactions, resequencing the transactions from highest to lowest, and\n       processing debits before credits.\n\n       This allegation does not appear in the section concerning damages or harm, but in\n\nthe section concerning Margolis’s adequacy as a class representative. Moreover, the\n\nallegation does not unambiguously state that the bank actually assessed any fees against\n\nhim solely because it had processed debits before credits. Instead, Margolis seems to\n\nallege that he incurred fees because of some combination of multiple factors: the bank’s\n\npractice of holding debit-card transactions (apparently until the end of a business day); of\n\nreordering the transactions from highest to lowest; and of processing debits before credits.\n\nIndeed, the focus of Margolis’s complaint (and his brief to this Court) was on batch-\n\nprocessing; processing debits before credits was less than an afterthought. Margolis said\n\nnothing about processing debits before credits even though the bank’s disclosures said\n\nnothing about it.\n\n       In these circumstances, Margolis has not satisfied the “‘stringent requirements of\n\nMaryland Rule 2-305,’” Shepter, 334 Md. at 104 (quoting P. Sandler & J. Archibald,\n\nPleading Causes of Action in Maryland, § 1.1, at 2 (1st ed. 1991)), under which a\n\ncomplaint must “contain a clear statement of the facts necessary to constitute a cause of\n\naction.” Md. Rule 2-305. Simple notice pleading does not suffice. Shepter, 334 Md. at\n\n104.\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       In view of the absence of factual allegations, as opposed to ambiguous conclusory\n\nassertions, in the complaint, Margolis failed to state a claim concerning the bank’s alleged\n\npractice of processing debits before credits.

Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318998\"><a href=\"/opinion/2318998/polek-v-jp-morgan-chase-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365 (2012) (affirming dismissal of complaint where plaintiffs did not\n\nsufficiently allege that they suffered actual injury because of CPA violation).11\n\n       D.     The Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n       Although Margolis did not assert a claim for breach of contract, he frequently\n\nrefers to Sandy Spring’s implied contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing.\n\nThose references typically occur in connection with his citation of federal trial court\n\ndecisions that interpret the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the law\n\nof states other than Maryland. Those cases typically state that, where a bank has the\n\ncontractual right to exercise discretion in ordering ATM and POS transactions, it must\n\n\n\n       11\n          Even if Margolis had alleged a misrepresentation or material omission sufficient\nto trigger liability under the CPA, he would not have stated a claim under section 13-\n301(9). That subsection “replicates common-law fraud insofar as it includes ‘[d]eception,\nfraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation, or knowing concealment,\nsuppression, or omission of any material fact with the intent that a consumer rely on the\nsame in connection with . . . [t]he promotion or sale of any consumer goods. . . .’”\nMcCormick v. Medtronic, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (2014) (quoting CL § 13-301(9)).\n“Accordingly, if a party alleges an ‘unfair or deceptive trade practice’ under that specific\nsubsection, he or she must allege fraud with particularity[.]” Id. Among other things, the\nrequirement of particularity means that a plaintiff must allege “why a finder of fact would\nhave reason to conclude that the defendant acted with scienter (i.e., that the defendant\neither knew that the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth) and\nwith the intention to persuade others to rely on the false statement).” Id. Because the\ncomplaint makes no effort to plead this aspect of fraud with anything resembling\nparticularity, it does not state a claim for a violation of section 13-301(9).\n\n                                             19\n\fexercise its discretion in good faith. See, e.g., In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig.,\n\n694 F. Supp. 2d at 1315.\n\n       Under Maryland law, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing ordinarily\n\nimposes no affirmative obligations outside the express terms of the contract itself. See\n\nPolek, 424 Md. at 363; see also Blondell v. Littlepage, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273456/blondell-v-littlepage/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (2010) (implied\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing generally “concerns the ‘performance and\n\nenforcement’ of the contract itself”). Hence, even if Margolis had alleged a breach of\n\ncontract, which he did not do, it is difficult to envision how the implied covenant would\n\nadvance his case, as he did not charge the bank with doing anything other than what it had\n\nthe express contractual right to do. See Blondell, 413 Md. at 114-15.\n\n       In any event, the implied covenant has no real bearing on Margolis’s CPA claim,\n\nbecause that claim turns on whether the bank made false representations or failed to\n\ndisclose material facts. Because we hold that the complaint did not adequately allege\n\nfalse representations or material omissions in violation of the CPA, we affirm the circuit\n\ncourt’s decision to dismiss it with prejudice.\n\n                                        C ONCLUSION\n\n       In affirming the dismissal of Margolis’s CPA claim, we should not be understood\n\nto have endorsed the bank’s practice of maximizing fees by reordering transactions to\n\ncreate overdrafts where they would not otherwise exist. We hold only that the Margolis’s\n\nallegations did not suffice to state a claim that the bank “concealed” its practices in\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fviolation of the CPA. Sandy Spring adequately disclosed those practices, and Margolis\n\nwas free to reject its services and to look for another bank with less onerous overdraft\n\npolicies if he so chose.\n\n                                                  JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT\n                                                  COURT FOR MONTGOMERY\n                                                  COUNTY AFFIRMED.
