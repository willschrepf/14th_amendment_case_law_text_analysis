Graman and Martin Graman appeal the trial court’s judgment, complaining of\n\nthe trial court’s grant of summary judgment and award of attorney’s fees. We conclude the\n\ndispositive issues before us are clearly settled in law. Accordingly, we issue this memorandum\n\nopinion pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 47.4. The factual nature of this case, as\n\nwell as its procedural history, pleadings, and evidence are known to the parties. Therefore, we\n\ndo not recount these matters in detail. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                          Background\n\n       Appellee IBP Retail No. 5, L.P. (“IBP”) owned a shopping center in Collin County. It\n\nleased space for a restaurant in that shopping center to Pizza Associates West Plano, LLC\n\n(“Pizza Associates”). Jason Graman executed the lease for Pizza Associates as its president.\n\nBoth Jason and Martin Graman executed a written guaranty, “guarantee[ing] the payment and\n\fperformance of all Tenant Finish Allowance and Leasing Commissions . . . for the first thirty-six\n\nmonths of the Lease term.” Both the lease and the guaranty provided that if IBP employed an\n\nattorney to enforce its rights under the guaranty, the prevailing party would recover its\n\nreasonable fees incurred. The parties amended the lease twice; the parties dispute the reasons for\n\nthe amendments. However, it is undisputed that Pizza Associates had not complied with the\n\namended lease by taking possession of the leased premises, completing its contractual\n\nimprovements on the property, or paying what it owed IBP as of December 10, 2008. On that\n\ndate, after giving notice, IBP terminated the lease.\n\n       IBP initially sued Pizza Associates for breach of the lease and sued the Gramans pursuant\n\nto their guaranty. IBP filed a traditional motion for summary judgment on those claims. The\n\nGramans filed a response; Pizza Associates did not. The trial court granted IBP’s motion in its\n\nentirety. IBP then dismissed its later-added claim against Jason Graman individually, making\n\nthe summary judgment final. The Gramans appealed; Pizza Associates did not.\n\n                             Summary Judgment on the Guaranty\n\n       In their first issue, the Gramans contend the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment against them because material fact issues exist on the elements of breach of the lease\n\nand the affirmative defense of mitigation of damages by IBP. The standard of review for a\n\ntraditional summary judgment is well established. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); McConnell v.\n\nSouthside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 341 (Tex. 1993). The movant for summary\n\njudgment has the burden of proving all essential elements of its cause of action or defense as a\n\nmatter of law. Black v. Victoria Lloyds Ins. Co., 797 S.W.2d 20, 27 (Tex. 1990). We review the\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment decision de novo. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164\n\nS.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                                –2–\n\f          The summary judgment evidence in this case establishes that IBP holds a guaranty of\n\npayment from the Gramans. 1 That guaranty essentially creates an obligation to pay according to\n\nthe terms of the guaranty if the obligor fails to pay. First Union Nat’l Bank v. Richmont Capital\n\nPartners I, L.P., 168 S.W.3d 917, 924 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.). Stated differently, the\n\nguaranty of payment is ancillary to the underlying lease. See id. Therefore, the rights and\n\nobligations of the guarantor are resolved by determination of the rights and obligations of the\n\nparties to the lease. See id. In this case, the rights and obligations under the lease have been\n\ndetermined as a matter of law in IBP’s favor, because (a) the trial court granted summary\n\njudgment against Pizza Associates, and (b) Pizza Associates failed to appeal that summary\n\njudgment. See Plas-Tex, Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 772 S.W.2d 442, 446 (Tex. 1989) (party’s\n\nfailure to appeal renders judgment against it final as to issue decided in judgment).\n\n          Because the judgment finding breach of the lease by Pizza Associates is final, the\n\nGramans’ complaints in this Court must be limited to the validity or scope of their guaranty, i.e.,\n\nto their obligation to pay for Pizza Associates. But the Gramans have not raised any issue related\n\nto their obligation to pay under the guaranty. Instead, their arguments are limited to complaints\n\nabout IBP’s conduct related to the lease. They contend IBP waived Pizza Associates’ breach and\n\nthat IBP would have suffered no loss if it had accepted Pizza Associate’s post-termination offer\n\nto cure. Pizza Associates’ liability—and IBP’s resulting right to recover—are settled. The\n\nGramans cannot avoid their own liability under the guaranty by questioning that settled\n\nunderlying liability under the lease.                      We conclude the Gramans have not raised a viable\n\nchallenge to the trial court’s summary judgment against them.\n\n          We overrule the Gramans’ first issue.\n\n\n\n   1\n       The guaranty states, “This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and performance, not a guaranty of collection.”\n\n\n\n                                                                    –3–\n\f                                           Attorney’s Fees\n\n       In their second issue, the Gramans argue the trial court erred in awarding IBP its\n\nattorney’s fees because IBP had not segregated its fees between claims for which fees are\n\nrecoverable and those for which fees are not recoverable. Specifically, the Gramans contend IBP\n\nshould have segregated fees between the claims covered by its motion for summary judgment\n\nand the claim not covered by its motion.\n\n       The grounds of the motion included breach of the lease by Pizza Associates and breach of\n\nthe guaranty by the Gramans. IBP pleaded an additional alternative claim for breach of the lease\n\nby Jason Graman individually. Earlier in the litigation, Pizza Associates had filed an amended\n\nanswer denying that it possessed the legal capacity to be sued, that it was liable in the capacity in\n\nwhich it was sued, and that it was an LLC as alleged. According to Pizza Associates, the basis\n\nfor these denials was that it “was never formed because its name was rejected by the Texas\n\nSecretary of State.” In response to this amended answer, IBP supplemented its breach-of-lease\n\nclaim to plead that if Jason Graman executed the lease on behalf of a non-existent, fictitious\n\nentity, then he was personally liable for all amounts due under the lease. After the trial court\n\ngranted IBP’s motion for summary judgment, IBP non-suited this remaining claim to make the\n\njudgment final.\n\n       The need to segregate fees is a question of law that we review de novo. Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 312 (Tex. 2006). The general rule, as the Gramans\n\ncontend, is a claimant must show its fees were incurred while suing the defendant on a claim that\n\nallows recovery of such fees. Id. Most cases addressing this issue involve a combination of\n\nclaims sounding in contract and tort, so that some claims provide for recovery of fees and some\n\ndo not. But we conclude that all of IBP’s claims are contract claims that provide for recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees. Both the lease and the guaranty provide for recovery of attorney’s fees by the\n\n                                                –4–\n\fparty prevailing in litigation related to those contracts. The Gramans do not challenge IBP’s\n\nright to recover its fees incurred in litigating the breach-of-lease suit against Pizza Associates or\n\nthe breach-of-guaranty claim against the Gramans. However, the non-suited claim against Jason\n\nGraman was also pleaded as a breach-of-contract claim, and if it had been tried, it would have\n\nbeen tried in terms of his liability under the lease. See generally A to Z Rental Ctr. v. Burris, 714\n\nS.W.2d 433, 436 (Tex. App.—Austin 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (“[O]ne who contracts as an agent\n\nin the name of a nonexistent or fictitious principal, or a principal without legal status or\n\nexistence, renders himself personally liable on those contracts.”); Patel v. Whiteco Indus., Inc.,\n\nNo. 05-90-01419-CV, 1991 WL 134576, at *4 (Tex. App.—Dallas July 23, 1991, no pet.) (not\n\ndesignated for publication) (same). We conclude IBP was not required to segregate its fees,\n\nbecause all of the claims it was litigating provided for the recovery of attorney’s fees.\n\n       We overrule the Gramans’ second issue.\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n       We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      /David Lewis/\n                                                      DAVID LEWIS\n                                                      JUSTICE\n\n\n120565F.P05\n\n\n\n\n                                                –5–\n\f                                         S\n                               Court of Appeals\n                        Fifth District of Texas at Dallas\n                                       JUDGMENT\n\nJASON L.

Specifically, the Gramans contend IBP\n\nshould have segregated fees between the claims covered by its motion for summary judgment\n\nand the claim not covered by its motion.\n\n       The grounds of the motion included breach of the lease by Pizza Associates and breach of\n\nthe guaranty by the Gramans. IBP pleaded an additional alternative claim for breach of the lease\n\nby Jason Graman individually. Earlier in the litigation, Pizza Associates had filed an amended\n\nanswer denying that it possessed the legal capacity to be sued, that it was liable in the capacity in\n\nwhich it was sued, and that it was an LLC as alleged. According to Pizza Associates, the basis\n\nfor these denials was that it “was never formed because its name was rejected by the Texas\n\nSecretary of State.” In response to this amended answer, IBP supplemented its breach-of-lease\n\nclaim to plead that if Jason Graman executed the lease on behalf of a non-existent, fictitious\n\nentity, then he was personally liable for all amounts due under the lease. After the trial court\n\ngranted IBP’s motion for summary judgment, IBP non-suited this remaining claim to make the\n\njudgment final.\n\n       The need to segregate fees is a question of law that we review de novo. Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312 (Tex. 2006). The general rule, as the Gramans\n\ncontend, is a claimant must show its fees were incurred while suing the defendant on a claim that\n\nallows recovery of such fees. Id. Most cases addressing this issue involve a combination of\n\nclaims sounding in contract and tort, so that some claims provide for recovery of fees and some\n\ndo not. But we conclude that all of IBP’s claims are contract claims that provide for recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees. Both the lease and the guaranty provide for recovery of attorney’s fees by the\n\n                                                –4–\n\fparty prevailing in litigation related to those contracts. The Gramans do not challenge IBP’s\n\nright to recover its fees incurred in litigating the breach-of-lease suit against Pizza Associates or\n\nthe breach-of-guaranty claim against the Gramans. However, the non-suited claim against Jason\n\nGraman was also pleaded as a breach-of-contract claim, and if it had been tried, it would have\n\nbeen tried in terms of his liability under the lease.
