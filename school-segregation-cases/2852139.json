Michael Mahoney, Magistrate\nJudge.\n\n\nArgued March 27, 2001--Decided April 18, 2001\n\n\n\n\n  Before Bauer, Posner, and Kanne, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n  Posner, Circuit Judge. Twelve years ago\nthe plaintiffs filed this suit against\nthe board of education of Rockford,\nIllinois, charging that the board had\nintentionally discriminated against black\nand Hispanic students. Though nominally a\nnew suit, it was actually a continuation\nof school desegregation litigation that\nhad started long before and had resulted\nin the entry of a remedial decree as\nearly as 1973. See Quality Education for\nAll Children, Inc. v. School Board, 362\nF. Supp. 985 (N.D. Ill. 1973).\nRealistically, we are dealing with a\nlawsuit that is almost 30 years old.\n\n  In 1994, the district judge found, by\ninference from disparities in educational\nachievement between white and minority\nstudents and from the school board’s\nfailure to take effective measures to\nprevent individual public schools from\nbecoming all white or all minority, that\nthe board had indeed engaged in\n\fintentional racial discrimination. 851 F.\nSupp. 905 (N.D. Ill. 1994). The board did\nnot appeal, and so the litigation moved\ninto the remedial stage, presided over by\na magistrate judge with the consent of\nthe parties. A formidably complex and\nambitious remedial decree was entered in\n1996, provoking appeals that led us the\nfollowing year to vacate many of its\nprovisions, such as racial quotas for\ncheerleaders, superseniority for minority\nteachers, unrealistic goals for closing\nthe white-minority gap in test scores,\nand limits on the number of minority stu\ndents who could enroll in remedial\nclasses. 111 F.3d 528 (7th Cir. 1997). We\npointedly warned against \"ambitious\nschemes of social engineering\" and stated\nthat children \"should not be made\nsubjects of utopian projects.\" Id. at\n534. Apart from misdescribing our opinion\nas having merely \"modified\" certain\nprovisions of the decree, the magistrate\njudge managed to avoid any reference to\nthat opinion in his latest, 57-page\nopinion here under review.\n\n  Later we remarked \"the failure of the\nparties, and, it seems, the magistrate\njudge and the special master who is\nassisting him, to heed the admonition of\nthe Supreme Court, see Missouri v.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 99 (1995); Board of\nEducation v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248\n(1991), which we have repeated, United\nStates v. Board of School Commissioners,\n128 F.3d 507, 510 (7th Cir. 1997), to\nbend every effort to winding up school\nlitigation and returning the operation of\nthe schools to the local school\nauthorities.\" 153 F.3d 834 (7th Cir.\n1998) (per curiam). And the following\nyear, in still another opinion, we warned\nof \"the looming interminability of this\nlitigation,\" and noting the school\nboard’s representation that full\ncompliance with the decree was achievable\nby 2002 we suggested that the board\nsubmit to the magistrate judge a plan for\nwinding up the litigation. 171 F.3d 1083,\n1090-91 (7th Cir. 1999). The board then\nmoved the magistrate judge to dissolve\nthe decree, effective June 30, 2002, the\nend of the 2001 school year. The board\nargued that it had achieved full\ncompliance with the decree’s objectives\nand that the remaining inequalities in\neducational achievement between white and\nminority students could not be attributed\nto the illegal conduct on which the\n\flitigation was based. (Why the board\nasked for deferred rather than immediate\ndissolution is unclear, but we are not\ndisposed to give it more relief than it\nasked for.) The magistrate judge agreed\nto relax some provisions of the decree,\nbut ruled that others must continue for\nat least another six (now five) years.\nThe plaintiffs would like the decree to\ncontinue in effect for at least 11 more\nyears. We stress \"at least.\" Nothing in\nthe logic of either the magistrate\njudge’s opinion or the plaintiffs’ brief\non appeal suggests any natural terminus\nto the decree.\n\n  Through the end of 1999 the taxpayers of\nRockford had incurred total costs of $238\nmillion to comply with the 1996 decree\nand its predecessors going back only to\n1989, of which more than half had been\nincurred since 1996. By now the total\nmust be substantially greater. Attorneys’\nfees alone are approaching $20 million.\nTwenty percent of the school district\nproperty taxes paid by homeowners in\nRockford go to fund the decree. As a\nresult of the improvements enabled by\nthis large expenditure, and a policy of\nallowing parents to choose which Rockford\npublic school to send their kids to, the\nschool district had by the end of 1999,\nwhen the school board filed its motion to\ndissolve the decree, succeeded in\ndesegregating its schools. Desegregation\nhad been defined by the magistrate judge\nas the condition in which the minority\ncomposition of each school would not\ndeviate by more than 15 percentage points\nfrom the minority composition of the\npopulation of the school district.\nBecause this is a tighter range than\nimposed in most school desegregation\ncases, the Rockford public schools are\nnow less segregated than those in any\nprevious case in which a school system\nwas declared \"unitary\" (that is, declared\nsufficiently desegregated to require the\ndissolution of the decree and the return\nof control of the public schools to the\nschool board). The plaintiffs fear\nbacksliding, and so want a wait-and-see\nperiod of at least 15 years after\ndesegregation, during which the decree\nwould remain in force.\n\n  The length of the litigation, the scale\nof the expenditures, and the achievement\nof desegregation constitute, against the\nbackground of applicable law, compelling\n\farguments to end this litigation. It used\nto be extremely difficult to modify any\nkind of equitable decree. See United\nStates v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106\n(1932). But as we noted recently in\nordering radical modification of another\ninstitutional reform decree, one that had\nsubjected the Chicago police to severe\nrestrictions on its power to investigate\nterrorist activities, the Supreme Court\nhas adopted a much more flexible standard\nfor the modification of decrees entered\nin institutional reform litigation than\nthe Swift standard of yore. Alliance to\nEnd Repression v. City of Chicago, 237\nF.3d 799, 800-01 (7th Cir. 2001); see\nRufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,\n502 U.S. 367, 378-81 (1992); Board of\nEducation v. Dowell, supra, 498 U.S. at\n248; see also Alexander v. Britt, 89 F.3d\n194, 197-98 (4th Cir. 1996). The Court\nbelieves the states and their\nsubdivisions have a right to the\nrestoration of control over the\ninstitutions of state and local\ngovernment as soon as the objectives of\nthe federal remedial decree have been\nachieved. Missouri v. Jenkins, supra, 515\nU.S. at 99; Bogard v. Wright, 159 F.3d\n1060, 1065 (7th Cir. 1998); People Who\nCare v. Rockford Board of Education, 153\nF.3d 834 (7th Cir. 1998) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Board of School\nCommissioners, supra, 128 F.3d at 510.\nUnlike decrees that bind private parties,\ndecrees that hand over the control of\nimportant state functions, such as\neducation, to federal courts \"are not\nintended to operate in perpetuity.\" Board\nof Education v. Dowell, supra, 498 U.S.\nat 248. \"[T]he Supreme Court disfavors\npermanent injunctions in school cases.\nThe administration of public schools is a\nstate executive function rather than a\nfederal judicial function, and so ought\nnot to be subjected to the perpetual\ntutelage of the federal courts.\" United\nStates v. Board of School Commissioners,\nsupra, 128 F.3d at 510.\n\n  The purpose of a school desegration\ndecree is to eliminate the consequences\nof segregation. When they have been\neliminated the decree has done its job\nand should be lifted. This simple\nprinciple, which we don’t understand the\nplaintiffs to be quarreling with,\ndictates our decision. The Rockford\npublic schools have been desegregated. No\nlonger are there any schools that are\n\f\"white only\" or \"minority only,\" or even\napproximations to such schools. Hundreds\nof millions of dollars have been poured\ninto the construction and renovation of\nschools and into programs designed to\nextirpate the traces of unlawful\nsegregation. Although minority\neducational achievement lags behind that\nof whites, there is no evidence that the\nlag is any greater in Rockford than in\notherwise similar districts that have no\nhistory of racial discrimination.\n\n  Four years ago almost to the day we\nnoted the absence of \"evidence that the\ngap in scholastic achievement between\nwhite and minority students in Rockford\nis any greater than the gap between white\nand minority students in school districts\nthat have not been found to have\ndiscriminated against their black and\nHispanic students.\" 111 F.3d at 537. One\nmight have expected the plaintiffs to\ntake the hint and look for such evidence.\nIf they have looked, they have found\nnothing. Although peppered with\nreferences to programs designed to\nachieve \"vestige elimination,\" the\nplaintiffs’ brief cites no evidence that\nthere are vestiges of unlawful\ndiscrimination still to eliminate. \"At\nsome point,\" moreover, \"the continuing\nand ineliminable traces of an earlier\nviolation are too slight to justify\ncontinued federal judicial control of\npublic education.\" United States v. Board\nof School Commissioners, supra, 128 F.3d\nat 511.\n\n  The reality is that until minority\nstudents achieve parity of educational\nachievement with the white students in\nthe Rockford public schools, the\nplaintiffs will contend that the minority\nstudents are victims of the unlawful\ndiscrimination of an earlier period in\nRockford’s history. Yet it is obvious\nthat other factors besides discrimination\ncontribute to unequal educational\nattainment, such as poverty, parents’\neducation and employment, family size,\nparental attitudes and behavior,\nprenatal, neonatal, and child health\ncare, peer-group pressures, and ethnic\nculture. Some of these factors may\nthemselves be due to or exacerbated by\ndiscrimination, but not to discrimination\nby the Rockford school board. The board\nhas no legal duty to remove those\nvestiges of societal discrimination for\n\fwhich it is not responsible. Insofar as\nthe factors that we have mentioned,\nrather than unlawful conduct by the\nRockford school board in years past, are\nresponsible for lags in educational\nachievement by minority students, the\nboard has no duty that a federal court\ncan enforce to help those students catch\nup. It may have a moral duty; it has no\nfederal constitutional duty.\n\n  No effort has been made by the\nplaintiffs, despite our warnings, to\npartition, however crudely, the lag in\nachievement that is due to the school\nboard’s past illegalities and the lag\nthat is due to other factors, factors for\nwhich the school board bears no federal\nlegal responsibility. The partition could\nbe made by comparing minority academic\nperformance in Rockford with the\nperformance of minority students in other\nschool districts after adjusting for the\nvarious factors that are not the school\nboard’s legal responsibility yet might be\nthought to influence the academic\nperformance of Rockford’s minority\nstudents, such as poverty, family\nstability, health, class size, and\nquality of teachers. There are\nstatistical methods for holding these\nfactors constant in order to isolate the\ninfluence, if any, of the board’s illegal\nconduct on the academic performance of\nRockford’s minority students. No such\nscientific comparison has been attempted-\n-nor even anything cruder.\n\n  The plaintiffs’ failure to recognize the\nimportance of trying to unpack the causes\nof disparate educational performance is\nillustrated by their contention that\nalthough the Rockford schools may now be\ndesegregated, the classrooms within those\nschools remain segregated and until they\nare desegregrated the decree must remain\nin force. What they mean by the\nclassrooms still being segregated is that\nminority students are underrepresented in\nadvanced courses. Yet enrollment in those\ncourses is open. No one is being kept\nout. (If enrollment were not open but\ninstead were rationed by test scores, a\nmuch smaller percentage of minority\nstudents would be enrolled in the\nadvanced classes, the magistrate judge\nfound--6 percent rather than 23 percent.)\nTo suppose that minority students are\nenrolling in these classes at a lower\nrate than white students because of\n\fschool segregation in the past is\nillogical, or at least unsubstantiated.\nThe schools are desegregated, the\nadvanced courses are open to any student,\nand if fewer minority students are\nenrolling than their proportion in the\nschool or school district as a whole, the\nnatural inference is not that the\nproportion is being held down by the fact\nthat years ago the schools were\nsegregated. That is conceivable, but so\nimprobable that evidence is required to\nuse the fact as a basis for continuing a\nfederal judicial officer in control of\nthe public school system. The plaintiffs’\ncase is an extreme version of post hoc\nergo propter hoc. It is provincial and\nnaive to suppose that because Rockford\nonce engaged in de facto segregation of\nits public schools, the choices of its\nminority students regarding voluntary\nenrollment in advanced classes open to\nall are a legacy of that segregation.\n\n  The plaintiffs’ principal argument for\nthe indefinite continuation of the decree\nis that the school board has not been\ncomplying with it in good faith. The\ndifference between technical compliance\nand compliance in good faith is that the\nlatter form of compliance does not\nexploit loopholes and ambiguities.\nPhilips Medical Systems Int’l B.V. v.\nBruetman, 8 F.3d 600, 604 (7th Cir.\n1993); United States v. Board of\nEducation, 799 F.2d 281, 289-90, 295 (7th\nCir. 1986); Manning v. School Board, No.\n99-2049, 2001 WL 264977, at *16 (11th\nCir. March 16, 2001). It is not, as the\nplaintiffs would have it, that the school\nboard must \"actively\" support the decree,\nmust express \"commitment\" to it, and,\nabove all, must not criticize it. The\nundemocratic implications of this\nposition leave us almost speechless. Are\nelected officials, the members of the\nschool board, elected long after and not\ncomplicit in the illegalities that gave\nrise to the litigation, forbidden, under\nthreat of never resuming control of the\npublic school system that they were\nelected to govern, to criticize a decree\nthat in pursuit of an ambitious and\npossibly quixotic scheme of social\nengineering has imposed a formidable tax\nburden on the people who elected these\nofficials?\n\n  Pressed at argument, the plaintiffs’\nable lawyer could not cite an instance in\n\fwhich the school board has violated any\nof the numerous provisions of the decree.\nHe may well be correct that the decree\nwould have achieved more had it been\nenthusiastically embraced by the board,\nbut state and local officials are under\nno duty to love the chains that federal\njudges, however justifiably, fasten upon\nthem.\n\n  The judgment is reversed with\ninstructions to grant the relief\nrequested by the school board. It should\ngo without saying that if the board takes\nadvantage of its new freedom from federal\njudicial control to discriminate against\nminority students in violation of federal\nlaw, it will expose itself to a new and\ndraconian round of litigation. We trust\nthat $238 million later, it has learned\nits lesson.\n\nReversed and Remanded,\nwith Instructions.\n\f",

Board of School\nCommissioners, supra, 128 F.3d at 510.\nUnlike decrees that bind private parties,\ndecrees that hand over the control of\nimportant state functions, such as\neducation, to federal courts \"are not\nintended to operate in perpetuity.\" Board\nof Education v. Dowell, supra, 498 U.S.\nat 248. \"[T]he Supreme Court disfavors\npermanent injunctions in school cases.\nThe administration of public schools is a\nstate executive function rather than a\nfederal judicial function, and so ought\nnot to be subjected to the perpetual\ntutelage of the federal courts.\" United\nStates v. Board of School Commissioners,\nsupra, 128 F.3d at 510.\n\n  The purpose of a school desegration\ndecree is to eliminate the consequences\nof segregation. When they have been\neliminated the decree has done its job\nand should be lifted. This simple\nprinciple, which we don’t understand the\nplaintiffs to be quarreling with,\ndictates our decision. The Rockford\npublic schools have been desegregated. No\nlonger are there any schools that are\n\f\"white only\" or \"minority only,\" or even\napproximations to such schools. Hundreds\nof millions of dollars have been poured\ninto the construction and renovation of\nschools and into programs designed to\nextirpate the traces of unlawful\nsegregation. Although minority\neducational achievement lags behind that\nof whites, there is no evidence that the\nlag is any greater in Rockford than in\notherwise similar districts that have no\nhistory of racial discrimination.\n\n  Four years ago almost to the day we\nnoted the absence of \"evidence that the\ngap in scholastic achievement between\nwhite and minority students in Rockford\nis any greater than the gap between white\nand minority students in school districts\nthat have not been found to have\ndiscriminated against their black and\nHispanic students.\" 111 F.3d at 537. One\nmight have expected the plaintiffs to\ntake the hint and look for such evidence.\nIf they have looked, they have found\nnothing. Although peppered with\nreferences to programs designed to\nachieve \"vestige elimination,\" the\nplaintiffs’ brief cites no evidence that\nthere are vestiges of unlawful\ndiscrimination still to eliminate. \"At\nsome point,\" moreover, \"the continuing\nand ineliminable traces of an earlier\nviolation are too slight to justify\ncontinued federal judicial control of\npublic education.\" United States v. Board\nof School Commissioners, supra, 128 F.3d\nat 511.\n\n  The reality is that until minority\nstudents achieve parity of educational\nachievement with the white students in\nthe Rockford public schools, the\nplaintiffs will contend that the minority\nstudents are victims of the unlawful\ndiscrimination of an earlier period in\nRockford’s history. Yet it is obvious\nthat other factors besides discrimination\ncontribute to unequal educational\nattainment, such as poverty, parents’\neducation and employment, family size,\nparental attitudes and behavior,\nprenatal, neonatal, and child health\ncare, peer-group pressures, and ethnic\nculture. Some of these factors may\nthemselves be due to or exacerbated by\ndiscrimination, but not to discrimination\nby the Rockford school board. The board\nhas no legal duty to remove those\nvestiges of societal discrimination for\n\fwhich it is not responsible. Insofar as\nthe factors that we have mentioned,\nrather than unlawful conduct by the\nRockford school board in years past, are\nresponsible for lags in educational\nachievement by minority students, the\nboard has no duty that a federal court\ncan enforce to help those students catch\nup. It may have a moral duty; it has no\nfederal constitutional duty.\n\n  No effort has been made by the\nplaintiffs, despite our warnings, to\npartition, however crudely, the lag in\nachievement that is due to the school\nboard’s past illegalities and the lag\nthat is due to other factors, factors for\nwhich the school board bears no federal\nlegal responsibility. The partition could\nbe made by comparing minority academic\nperformance in Rockford with the\nperformance of minority students in other\nschool districts after adjusting for the\nvarious factors that are not the school\nboard’s legal responsibility yet might be\nthought to influence the academic\nperformance of Rockford’s minority\nstudents, such as poverty, family\nstability, health, class size, and\nquality of teachers. There are\nstatistical methods for holding these\nfactors constant in order to isolate the\ninfluence, if any, of the board’s illegal\nconduct on the academic performance of\nRockford’s minority students. No such\nscientific comparison has been attempted-\n-nor even anything cruder.\n\n  The plaintiffs’ failure to recognize the\nimportance of trying to unpack the causes\nof disparate educational performance is\nillustrated by their contention that\nalthough the Rockford schools may now be\ndesegregated, the classrooms within those\nschools remain segregated and until they\nare desegregrated the decree must remain\nin force. What they mean by the\nclassrooms still being segregated is that\nminority students are underrepresented in\nadvanced courses. Yet enrollment in those\ncourses is open. No one is being kept\nout. (If enrollment were not open but\ninstead were rationed by test scores, a\nmuch smaller percentage of minority\nstudents would be enrolled in the\nadvanced classes, the magistrate judge\nfound--6 percent rather than 23 percent.)\nTo suppose that minority students are\nenrolling in these classes at a lower\nrate than white students because of\n\fschool segregation in the past is\nillogical, or at least unsubstantiated.\nThe schools are desegregated, the\nadvanced courses are open to any student,\nand if fewer minority students are\nenrolling than their proportion in the\nschool or school district as a whole, the\nnatural inference is not that the\nproportion is being held down by the fact\nthat years ago the schools were\nsegregated. That is conceivable, but so\nimprobable that evidence is required to\nuse the fact as a basis for continuing a\nfederal judicial officer in control of\nthe public school system. The plaintiffs’\ncase is an extreme version of post hoc\nergo propter hoc. It is provincial and\nnaive to suppose that because Rockford\nonce engaged in de facto segregation of\nits public schools, the choices of its\nminority students regarding voluntary\nenrollment in advanced classes open to\nall are a legacy of that segregation.\n\n  The plaintiffs’ principal argument for\nthe indefinite continuation of the decree\nis that the school board has not been\ncomplying with it in good faith. The\ndifference between technical compliance\nand compliance in good faith is that the\nlatter form of compliance does not\nexploit loopholes and ambiguities.\nPhilips Medical Systems Int’l B.V. v.\nBruetman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604 (7th Cir.\n1993); United States v.

March 16, 2001). It is not, as the\nplaintiffs would have it, that the school\nboard must \"actively\" support the decree,\nmust express \"commitment\" to it, and,\nabove all, must not criticize it. The\nundemocratic implications of this\nposition leave us almost speechless. Are\nelected officials, the members of the\nschool board, elected long after and not\ncomplicit in the illegalities that gave\nrise to the litigation, forbidden, under\nthreat of never resuming control of the\npublic school system that they were\nelected to govern, to criticize a decree\nthat in pursuit of an ambitious and\npossibly quixotic scheme of social\nengineering has imposed a formidable tax\nburden on the people who elected these\nofficials?\n\n  Pressed at argument, the plaintiffs’\nable lawyer could not cite an instance in\n\fwhich the school board has violated any\nof the numerous provisions of the decree.\nHe may well be correct that the decree\nwould have achieved more had it been\nenthusiastically embraced by the board,\nbut state and local officials are under\nno duty to love the chains that federal\njudges, however justifiably, fasten upon\nthem.\n\n  The judgment is reversed with\ninstructions to grant the relief\nrequested by the school board. It should\ngo without saying that if the board takes\nadvantage of its new freedom from federal\njudicial control to discriminate against\nminority students in violation of federal\nlaw, it will expose itself to a new and\ndraconian round of litigation. We trust\nthat $238 million later, it has learned\nits lesson.\n\nReversed and Remanded,\nwith Instructions.\n\f</pre>",
