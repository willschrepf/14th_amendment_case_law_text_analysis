The group met frequently to discuss and prepare for their defense against the purported forthcoming Negro uprising.  Lethal weapons, such as cannon, mortar, hand grenades, Molotov Cocktails, gun powder, and dynamite, were secured by the group for future use.  The ammunition was secreted in large quantities in appellant Hayes' garage and at an outlying farm area.  Several experiments were conducted by members of the group in the use of the explosives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"At the trial evidence was adduced through fellow members of the Longview group and other Longview residents about appellants' participation in the conspiracy to prepare for the counterattack.  It was shown that defendant Hayes, on June 25, 1970, dynamited a house purchased by a Negro woman in a white neighborhood.  There was also testimony that defendant Hayes and one of the coconspirators constructed 'booby traps' by placing dynamite in flashlight cases, wiring an electric cap to a battery which was then connected to the flashlight switch.  The device was designed to explode when the switch was turned on.  Hayes, McMaster and two coconspirators then took the devices and drove to a Negro residential neighborhood in Nacogdoches, Texas, where Hayes and one of the other men placed two of the 'booby traps'.  The evidence also showed that following the issuance of a federal court order by Judge Fisher on June 17, 1970, approving the busing of Negro students to all-white schools, appellants and other members of the group formulated a plan to impede the transportation of the students to the Longview schools by dynamiting the buses.  The plan was carried out and on July 4, 1970, under cover of darkness, charges of dynamite were set beneath the buses and exploded, causing serious damage to the vehicles and the parking area.\" 444 F.2d at 473-474.

With respect to Count 1, they contended: (1) the count failed to state an offense against the United States because it failed to specify if the Negro students were in the process of attending \"public\" or \"private\" schools; (2) the count was defective because it failed to allege a specific intent on the parts of the appellants to deprive the Negro students of a constitutionally protected right; (3) the count was deficient because it failed to allege that the prevention of the transportation of Negro students to school without regard to race or color deprived or was calculated to deprive the black children of a constitutionally protected right, and (4) the two paragraphs of the count alleged separate and distinct conspiracies.  As to Count 2, the grounds for dismissal asserted were: (1) it failed to state an offense against the United States because it failed to allege or identify the particular court order involved; (2) it was defective because it failed to allege that the order was a valid, final order of the court or that the same was in effect on the date of the alleged offense; (3) it was defective because it failed to set forth the language of the court order; and (4) it was defective because it failed to allege the specific duties, if any, imposed on the Longview Independent School District by the court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A supplemental motion to dismiss was submitted on October 5, 1970, contending that Judge Fisher's school desegregation order was invalid as contravening the proviso to Title 42, U.S.C., Section 2000c-6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Both motions were denied October 13, 1970, immediately prior to the commencement of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE DIRECT APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their judgments of conviction and the imposition of their sentences, the appellants took a timely joint appeal to this Court urging three grounds for reversal: (1) The prosecutor had prejudiced their substantial rights when he remarked to the jury that a child had asked him, \"Why did those men bomb those buses?\"; (2) The prosecutor's final argument to the jury included the improper assertion that, \"There is no doubt in anybody's mind in this courtroom that they are guilty\"; and (3) privately retained trial defense counsel was ineffective and incompetent.  We rejected each of those contentions and affirmed the judgments of conviction.  On direct appeal the appellant did not argue that the indictment failed to state offenses against the United States or that the trial judge had erroneously denied their motions to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE 2255 MOTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Guest, 1966, 383 U.S. 745, 86 S.Ct. 1170, 16 L.Ed.2d 239, was the primary basis for the motion to vacate the sentences imposed under Count 1 of the indictment.  It was urged that Count 1 failed to state an offense under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, because it did not include an allegation of \"state action\".  In addition, appellants asserted that no evidence of \"state action\" was presented at the trial which could conceivably have remedied the defect in the indictment.  The motion once again raised the issue of incompetency of trial defense counsel.  Finally, the appellant argued that they had been cleared of the Nacogdoches bombing upon which the prosecution had relied to show intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States took three positions in responding below to the motion.  First, the appellee maintained that the failure of the appellants to pursue the alleged insufficiency of the indictment on direct appeal (having raised that issue in the trial court) constituted a permanent waiver of the right to mount a collateral attack against the indictment by post-conviction proceedings.  Second, the United States asserted that a motion under Section 2255 is not an appropriate vehicle for an attack upon the sufficiency of the indictment.  Finally, the United States contended that regardless of the inapplicability of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was not necessary to allege and prove \"state action\" in this case because the Negro students who were in the process of being transported to a previously all-white public school enjoyed the right to attend school without regard to race or color under the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE DECISION OF THE DISTRICT COURT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that, because the appellants had raised the issue of the alleged insufficiency of the indictment by means of pre-trial motions to dismiss, this motion to vacate sentence constituted \"a second or successive motion for similar relief\" which the district court was not required to entertain.  Next, the district court held that the sufficiency of the indictment on which the defendants had been convicted was not subject to challenge in a collateral attack under Title 28, U.S.C. Section 2255.  According to the district court, such a challenge could have been made only on direct appeal of the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though asserting these two grounds for holding that the motion to vacate sentence failed for procedural reasons, the district court considered the merits of the motion and thereupon held that the black students being bused enjoyed Thirteenth Amendment rights to attend public school without regard to race or color, thereby eliminating the requirement for a showing of \"state action\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  For this proposition, the district court relied upon Griffin v. Breckenridge, 1971, 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE APPELLATE CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants urge reversal of the district court's denial of relief on the following grounds: (1) the appellants should not be barred from raising the \"state action\" challenge to the sufficiency of Count 1 in this proceeding under Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2255, because that issue was not litigated in the original prosecution and the subsequent appeal; (2) Count 1 failed to state an offense against the United States in that it did not allege \"state action\"; and (3) a new trial as to the offense alleged under Count 2 should be ordered in light of the asserted invalidity of Count 1 and the proven inadequacy of counsel at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States, urging affirmance, argues: (1) the district court did not err in holding that the appellants may not properly relitigate by motion under Section 2255 the sufficiency of the underlying indictment in stating an offense or of the evidence offered at trial to sustain the conviction; and (2) the district court did not err in ruling that Count 1 of the indictment stated an offense under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, with respect to the deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the facts of this case, we believe that the district court incorrectly held that the remedy provided by Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2255, was not available to the appellants for a challenge to the sufficiency of Count 1 of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the two pre-trial motions to dismiss the indictment raised the issue as to lack of \"state action\".  We hold therefore that this motion to vacate sentence is not \"a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second aspect of the United States' procedural defense, we believe that the motion to vacate sentence is not a mere challenge to the sufficiency of Count 1, but constitutes a claim that the sentencing \"court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence\", a ground expressly made the basis for collateral attack by Section 2255.  United States v. Guest, supra, was a prosecution under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, in which it was alleged that the defendants had entered into a private conspiracy to deprive blacks of federally protected rights.  Among such rights was the \"right to the equal utilization, without discrimination upon the basis of race, of public facilities in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia, owned, operated or managed by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or any subdivision thereof\".  One of the means alleged for the accomplishment of the conspiracy's objectives was \"causing the arrest of Negroes by means of false reports that such Negroes had committed criminal acts\".  The district court dismissed the indictment, M.D.Georgia, 1964, 246 F.Supp. 475, and the United States appealed.  In an opinion authored by Mr. Justice Stewart, the Supreme Court reversed.  The Supreme Court expressly disclaimed any intention to deal with Congress' power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  383 U.S. at 755, 86 S.Ct. at 1176, 16 L.Ed.2d at 247.  Instead, the Court held that the possible involvement of state or local law enforcement officials in the alleged conspiracy was enough to sustain the validity of the indictment under an Equal Protection Clause theory.  In so ruling, the Court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>*****</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>\"It is a commonplace that rights under the Equal Protection Clause itself arise only where there has been involvement of the State or of one acting under the color of its authority.\" 383 U.S. at 755, 86 S.Ct. at 1176, 16 L.Ed.2d at 247.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants contend that the right of black students to attend public schools without regard to race or color subsists only under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The argument follows that in the absence of \"state action\" in a conspiracy to deprive black students of that right, no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause is possible and a prosecution brought under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, is not appropriate.  Clearly, such an argument constitutes a jurisdictional challenge to the sentences imposed in this case.  If the argument is sound, Section 2255 is an appropriate means of raising it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court's decision in Rosecrans v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 378 F.2d 561, supports our determination that the appellants' motion to vacate sentence constitutes a jurisdictional challenge explicitly sanctioned by Section 2255.   Rosecrans was a Section 2255 proceeding attacking a conviction under Title 18, Section 241, for conspiracy to interfere with constitutional rights and for interference with the exercise of rights under a court order in violation of Title 18, Section 1509.  In affirming the district court's denial of relief we held that the subsequent acquittal of the defendant's codefendants did not affect the defendant's conviction on guilty pleas, particularly since the conspiracy count alleged that the conspiracy included persons unknown and there was evidence of the involvement of others.  Judge Phillips'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> opinion for this Court proceeded with these enlightening observations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>\"While a form of attack on a sentence under Sec. 2255, supra, is direct, the grounds therefor are limited to matters that may be raised on collateral attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>\"Where there is an offense defined by a federal statute of which the court has jurisdiction and there is an endeavor to charge such offense by the indictment or information and the court acquires jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the sufficiency of the indictment or information is not subject to collateral attack by habeas corpus or motion under Sec. 2255, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>\"However, if the indictment or information attempts to charge a nonexistent federal offense, or as it is sometimes called, an impossible offense, as where it appears the offense sought to be charged, even if defined by state law or known to the common law, is not defined by federal statute, it affirmatively appears that no federal offense was committed, the indictment is subject to collateral attack.\" 378 F.2d at 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar statement of the law appeared in our decision in Bankston v. United States, 5 Cir. 1970, 433 F.2d 1294, an appeal from an unsuccessful Section 2255 proceeding in which Bankston sought to set aside a conviction for armed bank robbery on the ground that the indictment failed to list the names of the individuals allegedly placed in jeopardy during the robbery.  We held that the indictment was sufficient when it merely stated that the persons put in jeopardy were bank employees, noting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>\"The applicable law is stated in 4 Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, Sec. 1913, as follows: 'If the sufficiency of an indictment is not questioned at the trial, the indictment must be held sufficient unless it is so defective that it does not, by any reasonable construction, charge an offense for which the defendant is convicted'.\"  433 F.2d at 1295.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the foregoing discussion we hold that the 2255 motion to vacate sentence stated an appropriate challenge to the jurisdiction of the sentencing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reach the fundamental question sought to be raised on this appeal: Does the right of black children to attend public schools without regard to race or color subsist solely under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?  If the answer is in the affirmative, the district court should have granted relief.  The absence of \"state action\" in the conspiracy charged under Count 1 rendered that Count fatally deficient under the teachings of Guest, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants point out that all the major court decisions dealing with racial segregation in this nation's public schools, starting with Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, have addressed that social problem in terms of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  But, as already noted, the United States takes the position that the Thirteenth Amendment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> also guarantees the right of black students to attend public schools without regard to race or color and that under the decision in Griffin v. Breckenridge, 1971, 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338, no showing of \"state action\" is necessary to establish a violation of Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Griffin v. Breckenridge was a private civil action to recover damages on account of an allegedly racially motivated assault committed upon a public highway.

In this post-conviction proceeding, they have advanced a new theory of trial defense counsel incompetence: that counsel allegedly failed to investigate and offer certain evidence which would have greatly aided their defense.  The district court disposed of this contention in the following manner:</p>\n        <p>\"(11) The testimony of the petitioners' witness, Floyd Thurman, was the only evidence presented on the second point raised in petitioners' motion.  His testimony is not credible.  Thurman, an elderly man from Smith County, Texas, testified that he overheard a conversation on the last Sunday in October, 1970, in a lounge in Richmond, Texas, near Houston, approximately 200 miles from the Longview-Tyler area.  This purported conversation was between three persons whom Thurman had never seen before and has never seen since.  The substance of the alleged conversation was that persons other than petitioners committed the violations charged in count one.  Although he was a mere eavesdropper, Thurman was able to give a detailed account as to their background and activities since World War II.  His description of the alleged conversation left the court with the conviction that it was the result of an overactive imagination.  Moreover, the witness Thurman insisted that he reported this conversation to the petitioners' attorney prior to trial.  The alleged conversation was overheard on October 25, 1970; the witness supposedly reported the conversation on October 27, 1970.  The docket sheet in Criminal Action No. 7110 shows petitioners' trial commenced on October 13, 1970, and concluded October 20, 1970.\"</p>\n        <p>Regarding the appellants' claim that they had been cleared of the Nacogdoches bombing incident, the district court found:</p>\n        <p>\"(12) Petitioners Fred Loyd Hayes and Kenneth Ray McMaster were indicted in Nacogdoches County, Texas, in Cause No. 8995 and charged with the offense of possession of a bomb, in violation of Vernon's Ann.P.C., Art. 1723.  During the trial, an expert witness called by the State claimed a privilege in refusing to divulge information as to how he disarmed the bomb in question.  The State District Attorney, rather than have the witness violate his privileged information or be held in contempt of court, moved to dismiss the indictment against the petitioners.  The Honorable Jack Pierce, Judge of the District Court of Nacogdoches County, 145th Judicial District of Texas, on motion of the State, dismissed the criminal action without deciding the merits of the case.  Petitioners were thus not 'cleared' of such criminal offense.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Amendment XIV, U.

The group met frequently to discuss and prepare for their defense against the purported forthcoming Negro uprising.  Lethal weapons, such as cannon, mortar, hand grenades, Molotov Cocktails, gun powder, and dynamite, were secured by the group for future use.

There was also testimony that defendant Hayes and one of the coconspirators constructed 'booby traps' by placing dynamite in flashlight cases, wiring an electric cap to a battery which was then connected to the flashlight switch.  The device was designed to explode when the switch was turned on.  Hayes, McMaster and two coconspirators then took the devices and drove to a Negro residential neighborhood in Nacogdoches, Texas, where Hayes and one of the other men placed two of the 'booby traps'.  The evidence also showed that following the issuance of a federal court order by Judge Fisher on June 17, 1970, approving the busing of Negro students to all-white schools, appellants and other members of the group formulated a plan to impede the transportation of the students to the Longview schools by dynamiting the buses.  The plan was carried out and on July 4, 1970, under cover of darkness, charges of dynamite were set beneath the buses and exploded, causing serious damage to the vehicles and the parking area.\" 444 F.2d at 473-474.

As to Count 2, the grounds for dismissal asserted were: (1) it failed to state an offense against the United States because it failed to allege or identify the particular court order involved; (2) it was defective because it failed to allege that the order was a valid, final order of the court or that the same was in effect on the date of the alleged offense; (3) it was defective because it failed to set forth the language of the court order; and (4) it was defective because it failed to allege the specific duties, if any, imposed on the Longview Independent School District by the court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A supplemental motion to dismiss was submitted on October 5, 1970, contending that Judge Fisher's school desegregation order was invalid as contravening the proviso to Title 42, U.S.C., Section 2000c-6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Both motions were denied October 13, 1970, immediately prior to the commencement of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE DIRECT APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their judgments of conviction and the imposition of their sentences, the appellants took a timely joint appeal to this Court urging three grounds for reversal: (1) The prosecutor had prejudiced their substantial rights when he remarked to the jury that a child had asked him, \"Why did those men bomb those buses?\"; (2) The prosecutor's final argument to the jury included the improper assertion that, \"There is no doubt in anybody's mind in this courtroom that they are guilty\"; and (3) privately retained trial defense counsel was ineffective and incompetent.

On direct appeal the appellant did not argue that the indictment failed to state offenses against the United States or that the trial judge had erroneously denied their motions to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE 2255 MOTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Guest, 1966, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107201\"><a href=\"/opinion/107201/united-states-v-guest/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107201\"><a href=\"/opinion/107201/united-states-v-guest/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, was the primary basis for the motion to vacate the sentences imposed under Count 1 of the indictment.  It was urged that Count 1 failed to state an offense under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, because it did not include an allegation of \"state action\".  In addition, appellants asserted that no evidence of \"state action\" was presented at the trial which could conceivably have remedied the defect in the indictment.  The motion once again raised the issue of incompetency of trial defense counsel.  Finally, the appellant argued that they had been cleared of the Nacogdoches bombing upon which the prosecution had relied to show intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States took three positions in responding below to the motion.  First, the appellee maintained that the failure of the appellants to pursue the alleged insufficiency of the indictment on direct appeal (having raised that issue in the trial court) constituted a permanent waiver of the right to mount a collateral attack against the indictment by post-conviction proceedings.  Second, the United States asserted that a motion under Section 2255 is not an appropriate vehicle for an attack upon the sufficiency of the indictment.  Finally, the United States contended that regardless of the inapplicability of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was not necessary to allege and prove \"state action\" in this case because the Negro students who were in the process of being transported to a previously all-white public school enjoyed the right to attend school without regard to race or color under the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE DECISION OF THE DISTRICT COURT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that, because the appellants had raised the issue of the alleged insufficiency of the indictment by means of pre-trial motions to dismiss, this motion to vacate sentence constituted \"a second or successive motion for similar relief\" which the district court was not required to entertain.  Next, the district court held that the sufficiency of the indictment on which the defendants had been convicted was not subject to challenge in a collateral attack under Title 28, U.S.C. Section 2255.  According to the district court, such a challenge could have been made only on direct appeal of the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though asserting these two grounds for holding that the motion to vacate sentence failed for procedural reasons, the district court considered the merits of the motion and thereupon held that the black students being bused enjoyed Thirteenth Amendment rights to attend public school without regard to race or color, thereby eliminating the requirement for a showing of \"state action\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  For this proposition, the district court relied upon Griffin v. Breckenridge, 1971, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108362\"><a href=\"/opinion/108362/griffin-v-breckenridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108362\"><a href=\"/opinion/108362/griffin-v-breckenridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We hold therefore that this motion to vacate sentence is not \"a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second aspect of the United States' procedural defense, we believe that the motion to vacate sentence is not a mere challenge to the sufficiency of Count 1, but constitutes a claim that the sentencing \"court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence\", a ground expressly made the basis for collateral attack by Section 2255.  United States v. Guest, supra, was a prosecution under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, in which it was alleged that the defendants had entered into a private conspiracy to deprive blacks of federally protected rights.  Among such rights was the \"right to the equal utilization, without discrimination upon the basis of race, of public facilities in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia, owned, operated or managed by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or any subdivision thereof\".  One of the means alleged for the accomplishment of the conspiracy's objectives was \"causing the arrest of Negroes by means of false reports that such Negroes had committed criminal acts\".  The district court dismissed the indictment, M.D.Georgia, 1964, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425280\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425280/united-states-v-guest/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, and the United States appealed.  In an opinion authored by Mr. Justice Stewart, the Supreme Court reversed.  The Supreme Court expressly disclaimed any intention to deal with Congress' power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  383 U.S. at 755, 86 S.Ct. at 1176, 16 L.Ed.2d at 247.  Instead, the Court held that the possible involvement of state or local law enforcement officials in the alleged conspiracy was enough to sustain the validity of the indictment under an Equal Protection Clause theory.  In so ruling, the Court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>*****</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>\"It is a commonplace that rights under the Equal Protection Clause itself arise only where there has been involvement of the State or of one acting under the color of its authority.\" 383 U.S. at 755, 86 S.Ct. at 1176, 16 L.Ed.2d at 247.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants contend that the right of black students to attend public schools without regard to race or color subsists only under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The argument follows that in the absence of \"state action\" in a conspiracy to deprive black students of that right, no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause is possible and a prosecution brought under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, is not appropriate.  Clearly, such an argument constitutes a jurisdictional challenge to the sentences imposed in this case.  If the argument is sound, Section 2255 is an appropriate means of raising it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court's decision in Rosecrans v.

Rosecrans was a Section 2255 proceeding attacking a conviction under Title 18, Section 241, for conspiracy to interfere with constitutional rights and for interference with the exercise of rights under a court order in violation of Title 18, Section 1509.  In affirming the district court's denial of relief we held that the subsequent acquittal of the defendant's codefendants did not affect the defendant's conviction on guilty pleas, particularly since the conspiracy count alleged that the conspiracy included persons unknown and there was evidence of the involvement of others.  Judge Phillips'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> opinion for this Court proceeded with these enlightening observations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>\"While a form of attack on a sentence under Sec. 2255, supra, is direct, the grounds therefor are limited to matters that may be raised on collateral attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>\"Where there is an offense defined by a federal statute of which the court has jurisdiction and there is an endeavor to charge such offense by the indictment or information and the court acquires jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the sufficiency of the indictment or information is not subject to collateral attack by habeas corpus or motion under Sec. 2255, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>\"However, if the indictment or information attempts to charge a nonexistent federal offense, or as it is sometimes called, an impossible offense, as where it appears the offense sought to be charged, even if defined by state law or known to the common law, is not defined by federal statute, it affirmatively appears that no federal offense was committed, the indictment is subject to collateral attack.\" 378 F.2d at 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar statement of the law appeared in our decision in Bankston v.

We held that the indictment was sufficient when it merely stated that the persons put in jeopardy were bank employees, noting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>\"The applicable law is stated in 4 Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, Sec. 1913, as follows: 'If the sufficiency of an indictment is not questioned at the trial, the indictment must be held sufficient unless it is so defective that it does not, by any reasonable construction, charge an offense for which the defendant is convicted'.\"  433 F.2d at 1295.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the foregoing discussion we hold that the 2255 motion to vacate sentence stated an appropriate challenge to the jurisdiction of the sentencing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reach the fundamental question sought to be raised on this appeal: Does the right of black children to attend public schools without regard to race or color subsist solely under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?  If the answer is in the affirmative, the district court should have granted relief.  The absence of \"state action\" in the conspiracy charged under Count 1 rendered that Count fatally deficient under the teachings of Guest, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants point out that all the major court decisions dealing with racial segregation in this nation's public schools, starting with Brown v.

In this post-conviction proceeding, they have advanced a new theory of trial defense counsel incompetence: that counsel allegedly failed to investigate and offer certain evidence which would have greatly aided their defense.  The district court disposed of this contention in the following manner:</p>\n        <p>\"(11) The testimony of the petitioners' witness, Floyd Thurman, was the only evidence presented on the second point raised in petitioners' motion.  His testimony is not credible.  Thurman, an elderly man from Smith County, Texas, testified that he overheard a conversation on the last Sunday in October, 1970, in a lounge in Richmond, Texas, near Houston, approximately 200 miles from the Longview-Tyler area.  This purported conversation was between three persons whom Thurman had never seen before and has never seen since.  The substance of the alleged conversation was that persons other than petitioners committed the violations charged in count one.  Although he was a mere eavesdropper, Thurman was able to give a detailed account as to their background and activities since World War II.  His description of the alleged conversation left the court with the conviction that it was the result of an overactive imagination.  Moreover, the witness Thurman insisted that he reported this conversation to the petitioners' attorney prior to trial.  The alleged conversation was overheard on October 25, 1970; the witness supposedly reported the conversation on October 27, 1970.  The docket sheet in Criminal Action No. 7110 shows petitioners' trial commenced on October 13, 1970, and concluded October 20, 1970.\"</p>\n        <p>Regarding the appellants' claim that they had been cleared of the Nacogdoches bombing incident, the district court found:</p>\n        <p>\"(12) Petitioners Fred Loyd Hayes and Kenneth Ray McMaster were indicted in Nacogdoches County, Texas, in Cause No. 8995 and charged with the offense of possession of a bomb, in violation of Vernon's Ann.P.C., Art. 1723.  During the trial, an expert witness called by the State claimed a privilege in refusing to divulge information as to how he disarmed the bomb in question.  The State District Attorney, rather than have the witness violate his privileged information or be held in contempt of court, moved to dismiss the indictment against the petitioners.  The Honorable Jack Pierce, Judge of the District Court of Nacogdoches County, 145th Judicial District of Texas, on motion of the State, dismissed the criminal action without deciding the merits of the case.  Petitioners were thus not 'cleared' of such criminal offense.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Amendment XIV, U.
