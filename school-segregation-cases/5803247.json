Marcum                            April 26, 2017\n                                                                                    released at 3:00 p.m.\n                                                                                  RORY L. PERRY II, CLERK\nWORKMAN, Justice, concurring in part, and dissenting in part.                   SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS\n                                                                                     OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n\n\n\n              I concur in the result the majority reaches in this specific case, but\n\nvehemently disagree with the all-encompassing syllabus point four that reads, in part:\n\n“Pursuant to W.Va. Code § 29B-1-4(a)(19) (2016) (Supp. 2016) disclosure of a videotape\n\nof the cell extraction of an inmate is prohibited[.]” (Emphasis added). After watching the\n\nvideotape at issue, 1 I concur that the Regional Jail has shown that it is exempt from\n\ndisclosure pursuant to West Virginia Code § 29B-1-4(a)(19), because it shows in some\n\ndetail the route of egress from an inmate’s cell to the outside of the facility, including the\n\nsecured points. Thus, if released, it “could be used by an inmate or resident to escape a\n\nfacility, or to cause injury to another inmate, resident or to facility personnel.” Id.\n\n\n\n              Each videotape of a jail cell extraction of an inmate should be analyzed to\n\ndetermine whether the circumstances in a given situation support a legal conclusion that\n\nit falls within a FOIA exemption. The majority should not have adopted a blanket rule\n\nwith respect to the applicability of this exemption to all such videotapes. Rather, the\n\nmajority should have preserved the right of the lower courts to make these specific\n\n\n\n       1\n         The lower court reviewed the videotape and made findings of fact on the incident\nin order to apply the FOIA exemption statute to those facts. Each and every member of\nthe majority was obligated to view the videotape before reversing the lower court’s legal\nanalysis of the FOIA issue, and I hope they did so.\n\n                                               1\n\n\fdeterminations on a case-by-case basis because other jail cell extraction videos may not\n\ncontain such information.\n\n\n\n              The strong tenor of the law is that the exemptions from the mandatory\n\ndisclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) are both narrowly\n\ndrafted and narrowly construed. This counterbalances the self-protective instincts of\n\nbureaucracy which, as in any organization, would prefer to operate under the relatively\n\nforgiving eye of only its own members rather than the more revealing “sunlight” of\n\npublic scrutiny.\n\n\n\n              The United States Supreme Court has explained that the federal FOIA, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552, is “a means for citizens to know ‘what their Government is up to.’ This\n\nphrase should not be dismissed as a convenient formalism. It defines a structural\n\nnecessity in a real democracy.” Nat’l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S.\n\n157, 171-172 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As the Supreme\n\nCourt has “consistently recognized[,] . . . the basic objective of the Act is disclosure.”\n\nChrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 290 (1979). At the same time, the statute\n\nrepresents a “balance [of] the public’s interest in governmental transparency against\n\nlegitimate governmental and private interests [that] could be harmed by release of certain\n\ntypes of information.” United Techs. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 601 F.3d 557, 559\n\n(D.C.Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Reflecting that balance,\n\nthe federal FOIA contains nine exemptions set forth in 5 U.S.C. § 552(b), which “are\n                                            2\n\n\fexplicitly made exclusive and must be narrowly construed.” Milner v. U.S. Dep’t of Navy,\n\n562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (citing FBI v.\n\nAbramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982)).\n\n\n\n              In the same way, West Virginia’s FOIA is, indeed, a pro-disclosure statute\n\nwith twenty specific exemptions. See W.Va. Code § 29B-1-4(a), in part (“[t]here is a\n\npresumption of public accessibility to all public records, subject only to the following\n\ncategories of information which are specifically exempt from disclosure[.]”). “This Court\n\nhas made clear that the FOIA’s exemptions are to be strictly construed, while the FOIA’s\n\ndisclosure provisions are to be liberally construed[.]” Highland Min. Co. v. W.Va. Univ.\n\nSch. of Med., 235 W.Va. 370, 381, 774 S.E.2d 36, 47 (2015). Where an enumerated\n\nexemption is relied on, the court must determine the matter de novo,2 and the public body\n\nasserting the exemption has the burden of sustaining the applicability of the asserted\n\nexemption.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         See generally Hamdan v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 797 F.3d 759, 769 (9th Cir. 2015)\n(“We review . . . FOIA cases in a two-step process. Berman v. CIA, 501 F.3d 1136, 1139\n(9th Cir. 2007). First, we review de novo whether the documents submitted by the\nagencies give an adequate factual basis for the district court’s decision. Id. If there is an\nadequate factual basis, we then determine ‘whether the district court’s decision regarding\n[the] applicability of FOIA’s exemptions was correct.’ Id. Factual findings are reviewed\nfor clear error, but legal conclusions, including whether a document fits within one of\nFOIA’s exemptions, are reviewed de novo. Id.”).\n\n                                             3\n\n\f              By adopting a wholesale rule that such records are categorically exempt\n\nfrom disclosure, the majority’s interpretation is impermissibly broad.3 The interaction of\n\ninmates and correctional officers may shed light on the operations of the correctional\n\nfacilities and their treatment of those who are incarcerated. “These are matters of\n\nlegitimate public concern.” Rataj v. City of Romulus, 858 N.W.2d 116, 125 (Mich. 2014).\n\nIn Rataj, an attorney filed suit against city, seeking to compel release of a videorecording\n\nshowing a police officer’s alleged assault of unnamed individual who had been arrested\n\nand handcuffed. The appeals court found the videotape was subject to disclosure, and\n\nnoted “the video would shed light on the operations of the [police department] and, in\n\nparticular, its treatment of those arrested and detained by its officers.” Id. at 125.\n\nCertainly, West Virginia citizens enjoy the same broad rights to obtain such public\n\nrecords, limited only by the coverage of the statute and its exemptions. Where there is a\n\n       3\n        As this Court held in syllabus point five, in part, of Farley v. Worley, 215 W.Va.\n412, 599 S.E.2d 835 (2004):\n\n                     In response to a proper Freedom of Information Act\n              request, a public body has a duty to redact or segregate\n              exempt from non-exempt information contained within the\n              public record(s) responsive to the FOIA request and to\n              disclose the nonexempt information unless such segregation\n              or redaction would impose upon the public body an\n              unreasonably high burden or expense.\n\nSee also Am. Immigration Lawyers Ass’n v. Exec. Office for Immigration Review, 830\nF.3d 667, 677 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“The statute thus sets forth the broad outlines of a\nprocess for agencies to follow when responding to FOIA requests: first, identify\nresponsive records; second, identify those responsive records or portions of responsive\nrecords that are statutorily exempt from disclosure; and third, if necessary and feasible,\nredact exempt information from the responsive records.”).\n\n                                             4\n\n\fbalance to be struck, the Legislature and this Court have stacked the scales in favor of\n\ndisclosure and against exemption. These determinations are highly fact-specific, and,\n\ntherefore, should be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n\n             For these reasons, I would not adopt the majority’s bright-line approach but\n\nwould leave the door open for the disclosure of jail cell extraction videotapes in some\n\nlimited circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\n\f",
