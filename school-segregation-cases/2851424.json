          "plain_text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNo. 99-1402\n\nRonald C. Denius,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv.\n\nWayne Dunlap and Gary Sadler/1,\n\nDefendants-Appellees.\n\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Central District of Illinois, Urbana Division.\nNo. 97-C-2088--Harold A. Baker, Judge.\n\n\nArgued January 6, 2000--Decided April 11, 2000\n\n\n\n       Before Coffey, Flaum and Kanne Circuit Judges.\n\n      Flaum, Circuit Judge. Ronald Denius filed suit\nagainst Wayne Dunlap in his individual and\nofficial capacity as director of the Lincoln\nChallenge Program (\"LCP\") seeking injunctive,\ndeclaratory and monetary relief under 42 U.S.C.\nsec.sec. 1983 and 1988. Denius alleges that\nDunlap violated his constitutional rights when\nDunlap refused to renew his employment contract.\nThe district court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of the defendant on qualified immunity\ngrounds. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm\nin part and reverse and remand in part.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n      The LCP is an eighteen-month program for 16 to\n18 year old high school dropouts located on the\npremises of the now-closed Chanute Air Force\nBase. Students participating in the LCP live on\ncampus for the first five months of the program\nand then live off campus for the remainder of the\nprogram under the supervision of mentors. The LCP\nuses a military training method with the goal of\nteaching \"life skills\" instead of military skills\nand has as its objective that all participants\nobtain a GED. By 1996, the LCP had two 400\nstudent classes each year. In 1996, the LCP\nreceived 100 percent of its funding from the\nfederal government but was administered by the\nState of Illinois. Students who have felony\nconvictions are not eligible to participate in\n\fthe LCP.\n\n      In 1993, Wayne Dunlap, an Army colonel, became\nthe director of the LCP. Dunlap retired from the\nArmy in 1994 but continued to serve as director\nof the LCP, becoming an employee of the State of\nIllinois.\n\n      Ronald Denius is a retired Air Force technical\nsergeant who has earned two bachelor’s degrees\nand a master’s degree. At the time he retired\nfrom the Air Force, Denius had a \"top secret\"\nsecurity clearance. In March 1994, Denius began\nwork as a teacher at the LCP under a three-month\ncontract that was to last until the end of that\nschool year. Denius taught math, science, social\nstudies, language arts and writing skills. Denius\ndid not carry a weapon or have any duties beyond\nthose of a typical teacher.\n\n      On July 1, 1994, Denius signed a two-year\ncontract to continue teaching at the LCP. At this\ntime, he signed a release form that authorized\nthe LCP to perform a criminal background check\nand collect his educational records (the \"1994\nRelease\"). This release did not contain a time\nlimitation. Criminal background checks were\nperformed on the initial group of LCP instructors\nin 1994, but no further criminal background\nchecks were performed on LCP personnel until\n1996.\n\n      In July of 1996, Denius was offered the\nopportunity to renew his teaching contract with\nthe LCP provided he sign an Authorization for\nRelease of Personal Information\n(\"Authorization\"). This Authorization required\nDenius to consent to the release of considerably\nmore confidential information than provided in\nthe 1994 Release. LCP Director Dunlap had\nacquired the Authorization from Captain John\nMoraitis of the Illinois State Police who\ninformed Dunlap that the Authorization was used\nby the police for background checks of\ngubernatorial candidates and applicants for\nemployment with the State Police. Moraitis\nsuggested that Dunlap consult an attorney before\nusing the Authorization at the LCP, but Dunlap\ndid not heed this advice.\n\n      The Authorization provided in pertinent part:\n\nFor the period of one year from the execution of\nthis form I ________, do hereby authorize a\nreview of and full disclosure of all records\nconcerning myself to any duly authorized agent of\nthe Lincoln Challenge Program, whether the said\nrecords are of a public, private or confidential\nnature.\n\fThe intent of this authorization is to give my\nconsent for full and complete disclosure of\nrecords of educational institutions; financial or\ncredit institutions, including records of loans,\nthe records of commercial or retail credit\nagencies (including credit reports and/or\nratings); and other financial statements and\nrecords wherever filed; records maintained by the\nNational Personnel Records Center, the U.S.\nVeteran’s Administration, and County, State or\nFederal Law Enforcement Agencies; employment and\npre-employment records, including background\nreports, efficiency ratings, complaints or\ngrievances filed by or against me and the records\nand recollections of attorneys at law, or of\nother counsel, whether representing me or another\nperson in any case, either criminal or civil, in\nwhich I presently have, or have had an interest.\n\n. . . I also certify that any person(s) who may\nfurnish such information concerning me shall not\nbe held accountable for giving this information;\nand I do hereby release said person(s) from any\nand all liability which may be incurred as a\nresult of furnishing such information. I further\nrelease the Lincoln Challenge Program from any\nand all liability which may be incurred as a\nresult of collecting such information.\n\n      Denius signed the 1996 employment contract but\nrefused to sign the Authorization. Dunlap told\nDenius that his contract was not valid unless he\nsigned the Authorization. Denius attempted to\nresume his teaching responsibilities on August 2,\n1996, the beginning of the school term for that\nyear. When he did so, Dunlap informed Denius that\nhe could not be employed by the LCP unless he\nsigned the Authorization, and he asked Denius to\nleave the LCP premises. Denius’s refusal to sign\nthe Authorization was the sole reason his\nemployment contract with the LCP was not renewed.\n\n      At the time he required Denius to sign the\nAuthorization, Dunlap did not intend to use it\nfor any purpose other than to perform a routine\ncriminal background check because the LCP did not\nhave the funds to perform a more thorough\nbackground investigation. If the LCP had\npossessed the funds, Dunlap would have conducted\na more extensive background check. However,\nDunlap did not tell Denius that he only intended\nto use the Authorization for a routine criminal\nbackground check.\n\n      Denius filed suit under 42 U.S.C. sec.sec. 1983\nand 1988 asserting that Dunlap had violated his\nconstitutional rights under the First, Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendments by refusing to renew his\nemployment contract unless he signed the\nAuthorization. Denius sought injunctive,\n\fdeclaratory and monetary relief. The district\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of\nDunlap, finding that Dunlap was entitled to\nqualified immunity for all of the claims brought\nby Denius. Denius now appeals.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      The district court granted summary judgment to\nthe defendant and denied summary judgment to the\nplaintiff. We review a district court’s summary\njudgment decisions de novo. See Henderson v.\nSheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 848 (7th Cir. 1999). In\nconducting our evaluation, we view all evidence\nin the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty and draw all reasonable inferences in that\nparty’s favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).\n\nB.    Monetary Relief\n\n      The district court concluded that Denius’s suit\nfor monetary damages was barred because Dunlap\nwas protected by qualified immunity. Denius\nargues that the district court erred in reaching\nthis conclusion.\n\n1.    Qualified Immunity\n\n      The doctrine of qualified immunity is an\naffirmative defense to allegations that a state\nofficial violated the constitutional rights of a\nplaintiff. Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 231\n(1991); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815\n(1982). This defense is available only to state\nofficials who occupy positions with discretionary\nor policymaking authority, and it protects those\nindividuals solely when they are acting in their\nofficial capacity. Harlow, 457 U.S. at 816. These\nofficials \"are shielded from liability for civil\ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate\nclearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818; see Wilson v.\nLayne, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1696 (1999); Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987).\n\n      To evaluate a claim of qualified immunity, we\nengage in a two-step analysis. First, we\ndetermine whether the plaintiff’s claim states a\nviolation of his constitutional rights. Then, we\ndetermine whether those rights were clearly\nestablished at the time the violation occurred.\nSee Wilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1697; Khuans v. School\nDist. 100, 123 F.3d 1010, 1013 (7th Cir. 1997).\nIf the rights were clearly established, the\nofficial may be liable for monetary damages and\nthe suit proceeds to the next stage. If the\n\frights were not clearly established, then the\nofficial is immune from suit and the claim is\ndismissed. See Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S.\n399, 403 (1997) (\"[A] legal defense may well\ninvolve ’the essence of the wrong,’ while an\nimmunity frees one who enjoys it from a lawsuit\nwhether or not he acted wrongly.\"). Because the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity should not stand\nas an impediment to the clarification and\nevolution of a court’s articulation of\nconstitutional principles, we evaluate the\nconstitutionality of the official’s conduct even\nthough, in the end, he may not be held liable for\nmonetary damages flowing from that conduct. See\nWilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1697 (\"Deciding the\nconstitutional question before addressing the\nqualified immunity question . . . promotes\nclarity in the legal standards for official\nconduct, to the benefit of both the officers and\nthe general public.\"); County of Sacramento v.\nLewis, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1714 n.5 (1998).\n\n      It is the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate the\nexistence of a clearly established constitutional\nright. Kernats v. O’Sullivan, 35 F.3d 1171, 1176\n(7th Cir. 1994). A clearly established right is\none where \"[t]he contours of the right [are]\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official\nwould understand that what he is doing violates\nthat right.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640; see\nWilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1700. To determine whether\na right is clearly established, we look first to\ncontrolling Supreme Court precedent and our own\ncircuit decisions on the issue. Because there is\nan almost infinite variety of factual scenarios\nthat may be brought into the courtroom, a\nplaintiff need not point to cases that are\nidentical to the presently alleged constitutional\nviolation. However, \"the contours of the right\nmust have been established so that the\nunlawfulness of the defendant’s conduct would\nhave been apparent in light of existing law.\"\nCleveland-Perdue v. Brutsche, 881 F.2d 427, 430\n(7th Cir. 1989).\n\n      In the absence of controlling precedent, we\nbroaden our survey to include all relevant\ncaselaw in order to determine \"whether there was\nsuch a clear trend in the caselaw that we can say\nwith fair assurance that the recognition of the\nright by a controlling precedent was merely a\nquestion of time.\" Id. at 431. A split among\ncourts regarding the constitutionality of conduct\nanalogous to the conduct in question is an\nindication that the right was not clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation.\nSee Wilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1701 (\"If judges thus\ndisagree on a constitutional question, it is\nunfair to subject [the defendant] to money\ndamages for picking the losing side of the\n\fcontroversy.\"). In some rare cases, where the\nconstitutional violation is patently obvious, the\nplaintiff may not be required to present the\ncourt with any analogous cases, as widespread\ncompliance with a clearly apparent law may have\nprevented the issue from previously being\nlitigated. See Kernats, 35 F.3d at 1176.\n\n      The plaintiff Denius alleges that the defendant\ndirector of a state-run and federally-funded\neducational institution abused his position of\nauthority by requiring the plaintiff to sign the\nAuthorization as a condition of employment in\nviolation of his constitutional rights. In\nresponse to these allegations, the defendant\nDunlap asserts qualified immunity as an\naffirmative defense. It is unquestioned that\nDunlap, as the director of a public school, is\nentitled to qualified immunity for the decisions\nhe makes in hiring and firing the employees under\nhis supervision. See Khuans, 123 F.3d at 1013\n(holding that a school superintendent making the\ndecision not to renew the contract of a school\npsychologist was \"a government official\nperforming discretionary functions\" who was\nentitled to qualified immunity). Thus, even if we\nfind that Dunlap violated Denius’s constitutional\nrights by requiring him to sign the\nAuthorization, Dunlap is immune from suit for\ndamages under sec. 1983 if those rights were not\nclearly established at the time in question.\n\n2.   Pickering Balancing Test\n\n      It is clearly established that a public school\nteacher cannot have his employment conditioned\nupon his relinquishment of a constitutional right\nunless the interest of the school \"as an\nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the\npublic services it performs through its\nemployees,\" outweighs the individual interests of\nthe teacher in asserting his constitutional\nrights. Pickering v. Board of Educ. of Township\nHigh Sch. Dist. 205, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968);\nsee Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209,\n234 (1977); Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 283-84 (1977);\nShelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488 (1960). At\nthis stage of the proceedings, the defendant has\narticulated no interest that the LCP has in\nobtaining the information it was permitted to\ngather through the Authorization. Dunlap stated\nthat he did not intend to use any additional\ninformation beyond that which Denius had already\nconsented to release for the initial 1994\nbackground check, and Dunlap did not present any\nother justification for requiring the\ninformation./2 Because Dunlap has articulated no\ninterest that is promoted by requiring Denius to\nsign the Authorization, it is unnecessary for us\n\fto determine at this time whether the interests\nof the LCP as an employer outweigh the\nconstitutional rights of Denius.\n\n      Dunlap acknowledges that the only reason Denius\nwas dismissed from his teaching position was his\nrefusal to sign the Authorization./3 Therefore,\nif a finding that Denius has a clearly\nestablished constitutional right not to sign the\nAuthorization is made, then it follows that\nconditioning his employment as a public school\nteacher on the relinquishment of that right\nwithout any justification is a violation of a\nclearly established right for which Dunlap cannot\nreceive qualified immunity. See Keyishian v.\nBoard of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 605-06 (1967)\n(\"[T]he theory that public employment which may\nbe denied altogether may be subjected to any\nconditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has\nbeen uniformly rejected.\") (citations omitted).\n\n      We now examine each of Denius’s constitutional\nclaims to determine: 1) whether a constitutional\nright exists; and 2) whether that right was\nclearly established at the time in question.\n\n3.   Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n      The Authorization requires that Denius \"give\n[his] consent for full and complete disclosure of\n. . . the records and recollections of attorneys\nat law, or of other counsel, whether representing\n[him] or another person in any case, either\ncriminal or civil, in which [he] presently [has]\nor [has] had an interest.\" Denius argues that the\nintent and effect of this section of the\nAuthorization is to require him to waive his\nattorney-client privilege and allow the state\naccess to all information that would otherwise be\nprotected by this doctrine. Denius contends that\nthis compelled waiver violates his constitutional\nrights under the First and Sixth Amendments as\napplied to the states through the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU.S. 335 (1963); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372\nU.S. 229 (1963).\n\n      Under the doctrine of attorney-client privilege,\nconfidential communications between a client and\nan attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal\nadvice are privileged. A court cannot compel\nrevelation of these communications through\ndiscovery or testimony in civil or criminal\nmatters. This doctrine is a common law privilege\nthat can be explicitly or implicitly waived by\nthe client and is subject to a number of\nrestrictions and exceptions. The privilege is\nimplicitly waived if the client communicates\ninformation to his attorney without the intent\nthat that information remain confidential. See\n\fgenerally Moore’s Federal Practice 3d sec. 26.49;\nWeinstein’s Federal Evidence 2d ch. 503.\n\n      In this case, we agree that Denius has been\nasked to waive his privilege of confidentiality\nregarding the information he communicates to an\nattorney as a condition of employment with the\nLCP. If Denius were to sign the Authorization,\nall previously protected communications with his\nattorney would no longer be privileged.\nFurthermore, the Authorization may jeopardize the\nattorney-client privilege for all future\ncommunications. Because these communications\nwould be made with the knowledge that Denius has\ngiven consent for his attorney to transmit the\ninformation to the LCD, they are no longer\nconfidential and, therefore, not protected by the\nprivilege. See Weinstein’s Federal Evidence sec.\n503.15(2); United States v. Lawless, 709 F.2d\n485, 487 (7th Cir. 1983) (\"When information is\ntransmitted to an attorney with the intent that\nthe information will be transmitted to a third\nparty . . . , such information is not\nconfidential.\")./4\n\n      We now consider whether this mandatory waiver\nof the attorney-client privilege violates\nDenius’s constitutional rights. Denius contends\nthat the attorney-client privilege implicates his\nright to counsel under the Sixth Amendment as\nwell as his rights of free speech, association\nand petition under the First Amendment. We\naddress each of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n      a.   Sixth Amendment\n\n      The Authorization includes the release of\ninformation related to all legal matters \"either\ncivil or criminal.\" Where the Sixth Amendment\nright to the effective assistance of counsel\nattaches, this right includes the ability to\nspeak candidly and confidentially with counsel\nfree from unreasonable government interference.\nSee Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619, 630-31 (7th\nCir. 1973) (recognizing confidentiality in the\nattorney-client relationship as an essential\ncomponent of the Sixth Amendment right to\neffective assistance of counsel); cf. Weatherford\nv. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 552 (1977) (recognizing\nthat state interference with confidential\nattorney-client communications implicates a\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment right to effective\nassistance of counsel and may in some\ncircumstances require the reversal of a\nconviction). However, an individual enjoys no\nprotection provided by the Sixth Amendment until\nthe instigation of criminal proceedings against\nhim. See McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 175\n(1991); Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 440 n.16\n\f(1960). As Denius has at no time been the subject\nof a criminal prosecution, his Sixth Amendment\nrights are not implicated./5\n\n\n      b. First Amendment\n      Denius next contends that requiring him to sign\nthe Authorization and waive his attorney-client\nprivilege as a condition of employment violates\nhis First Amendment rights of speech, association\nand petition.\n\n      The right to hire and consult an attorney is\nprotected by the First Amendment’s guarantee of\nfreedom of speech, association and petition. See\nDeLoach v. Bevers, 922 F.2d 618, 620 (10th Cir.\n1990) (\"The right to retain and consult an\nattorney . . . implicates not only the Sixth\nAmendment but also clearly established First\nAmendment rights of association and free\nspeech.\"); Martin v. Lauer, 686 F.2d 24, 32 (D.C.\nCir. 1982). It has long been recognized that the\nFirst Amendment prohibits the state from\ninterfering with collective action by individuals\nto seek legal advice and retain legal counsel.\nSee United Transp. Union v. State Bar of Mich.,\n401 U.S. 576, 585-86 (1971) (\"[C]ollective\nactivity undertaken to obtain meaningful access\nto the courts is a fundamental right within the\nprotection of the First Amendment.\"); United Mine\nWorkers of Am. v. Illinois State Bar Ass’n, 389\nU.S. 217, 221-22 (1967) (\"[T]he freedom of\nspeech, assembly, and petition guaranteed by the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments gives petitioner\nthe right to hire attorneys on a salary basis to\nassist its members in the assertion of their\nlegal rights.\"); see also Brotherhood of R.R.\nTrainmen v. Virginia, 377 U.S. 1, 6 (1964); NAACP\nv. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 429-30 (1963). Likewise,\nthe state cannot impede an individual’s ability\nto consult with counsel on legal matters. See\nBates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 376\nn.32 (1977) (\"Underlying [the collective action\ncases] was the Court’s concern that the aggrieved\nreceive information regarding their legal rights\nand the means of effectuating them. This concern\napplies with at least as much force to aggrieved\nindividuals as it does to groups.\"); see also\nTrainmen, 377 U.S. at 7 (\"A State could not . .\n. infringe in any way the right of individuals\nand the public to be fairly represented in\nlawsuits . . . .\"). Furthermore, the right to\nobtain legal advice does not depend on the\npurpose for which the advice is sought. This\nright applies equally to legal representation\nintended to advocate a political or social\nbelief, see Button, 371 U.S. at 419-20, or to\nrecover damages in a personal injury suit, see\nUnited Mine Workers, 389 U.S. at 223. See also\nid. (stating that in earlier cases \"we rejected\n\fthe contention . . . that the principles\nannounced in Button were applicable only to\nlitigation for political purposes\"). In sum, the\nFirst Amendment protects the right of an\nindividual or group to consult with an attorney\non any legal matter.\n\n      The ability to maintain confidentiality in\nattorney-client communications is an important\ncomponent of the right to obtain legal advice.\n\"[T]he right to confer with counsel would be\nhollow if those consulting counsel could not\nspeak freely about their legal problems.\" Martin,\n686 F.2d at 32. The centrality of confidentiality\nto the effective rendering of legal advice is\nreflected in the long-standing common law\nprivilege for attorney-client communications. See\nSwidler & Berlin v. United States, 524 U.S. 399,\n403 (1998). This privilege not only protects the\ninterest of the client in receiving the best\nlegal advice but also \"’promote[s] broader public\ninterests in the observance of law and the\nadministration of justice.’\" Id. (quoting Upjohn\nCo. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981)).\nBecause the maintenance of confidentiality in\nattorney-client communications is vital to the\nability of an attorney to effectively counsel her\nclient, interference with this confidentiality\nimpedes the client’s First Amendment right to\nobtain legal advice.\n\n      The First Amendment may be implicated where the\nstate compels an individual to speak. If by\ncompelling an individual to reveal information\nthat he would rather keep confidential the state\nchills the individual’s ability to engage in\nprotected speech, the state has infringed the\nindividual’s First Amendment right in the\nprotected speech, unless it provides a sufficient\njustification for the required disclosure. See\nMcIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm., 514 U.S. 334,\n341-42 (1994); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.\nPatterson, 357 U.S. 449, 462-63 (1958). The level\nof justification required by the state will vary\ndepending on the nature of the speech involved.\nSee McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 347.\n\n      In this case, Denius alleges that the state is\ncompelling the revelation of information he would\nprefer to keep confidential by requiring him to\nwaive his attorney-client privilege. He argues\nthat this compelled revelation of confidential\ncommunications chills the protected speech\ninvolved in his consultation with an attorney on\nlegal matters. At this stage of the proceedings,\nDunlap has offered no reason for requiring that\nDenius waive his attorney-client privilege.\nTherefore, we need not decide and do not address\nthe level of justification required for the state\nto overcome an individual’s right to maintain\n\fconfidentiality in his legal communications with\nhis attorney. We merely conclude that absent\nappropriate justification the state cannot compel\nthe revelation of privileged attorney-client\ncommunications. Therefore, if the LCP had no\nbasis for requiring Denius to reveal confidential\nattorney-client communications, Dunlap violated\nDenius’s First Amendment rights when he refused\nto renew Denius’s contract solely because Denius\ndeclined to waive his attorney-client privilege.\n\n      However, the parameters of an individual’s First\nAmendment right to confidential communications\nwith his attorney were not clearly defined before\nthis incident occurred. There is no existing\nSupreme Court or Seventh Circuit precedent on\nthis issue, and we are only able to find two\ncases from fellow circuit courts articulating\nthis right. See DeLoach v. Bevers, 922 F.2d 618,\n620 (10th Cir. 1990); Martin v. Lauer, 686 F.2d\n24 (D.C. Cir. 1982). These two cases do not\nrepresent a trend in the law that would\ninevitably lead to the result we announce here.\nSimilarly, the constitutional dimensions of the\nattorney-client privilege are not so patently\nobvious that no existing case law is required to\nshow the right is clearly established. Therefore,\nwe also hold that Dunlap is shielded by qualified\nimmunity for any possible violation of Denius’s\nFirst Amendment right to confidential\ncommunications with his attorney, and we affirm\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment to\nthe defendant on this issue.\n\n4.   Other disclosures\n\n      In addition to requiring that Denius waive his\nattorney-client privilege, the Authorization also\npermits the release of other confidential\ninformation including all records pertaining to:\n1) educational, 2) financial, 3)\nmilitary/veterans, 4) criminal, or 5) employment\nmatters./6 Again, the LCD proffers no\njustification at this stage for requiring\ndisclosure of this broad range of information.\nDenius contends that requiring him to authorize\nthese disclosures violates his right to privacy\nin confidential information.\n      The \"concept of ordered liberty\" protected by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause has\nbeen interpreted to include \"the individual\ninterest in avoiding disclosure of personal\nmatters.\" Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600\n(1977); see also Nixon v. Administrator of\nGeneral Servs., 433 U.S. 425, 465 (1977)\n(recognizing \"a legitimate expectation of privacy\nin [ ] personal communications\"); Pesce v. J.\nSterling Morton High Sch., 830 F.2d 789, 795 (7th\nCir. 1987) (\"The federal constitution does, of\ncourse, protect certain rights of privacy\n\fincluding a right of confidentiality in certain\ntypes of information.\"). This Court has\nrecognized that \"the federal right of\nconfidentiality might in some circumstances be\nimplicated when a state conditions continued\nemployment on the disclosure of private\ninformation.\" Pesce, 830 F.2d at 797.\n\n      However, the scope and contours of this right\nhave not been defined in this Circuit. For\nexample, it is not clear whether the right of\nconfidentiality covers all confidential\ninformation or only confidential information\nrelating to certain matters. In this Circuit, the\nright clearly covers medical records and\ncommunications. See Anderson v. Romero, 72 F.3d\n518, 522 (7th Cir. 1995) (noting the recognition\nof this right as early as 1992); Schaill v.\nTippecanoe County Sch. Corp., 864 F.2d 1309, 1322\nn.19 (7th Cir. 1989) (recognizing \"a substantial\nprivacy interest in the confidentiality of\nmedical information\"). But, it is not clear\nwhether other confidential information, such as\nthat contained in financial records, also\nreceives similar protection under this right.\nFurthermore, while it is apparent that some form\nof balancing test would be used to determine when\nthis right of confidentiality has been violated,\nthat test has not been defined in this Circuit.\nSee Pesce, 830 F.2d at 797 n.5 (noting that other\ncourts have used either a \"general balancing of\ninterests\" or strict scrutiny when addressing\nthis right, and declining to define a test for\nuse in this Circuit); see also Fraternal Order of\nPolice v. City of Philadelphia, 812 F.2d 105, 110\n(3d Cir. 1987) (noting that the majority of\ncircuits have adopted intermediate scrutiny for\nrequired disclosures of confidential information\nand that some circuits have employed a compelling\ninterest test where the intrusion was\nparticularly egregious); cf. Nixon, 433 U.S. at\n465 (balancing interests); Whalen, 429 U.S. at\n601-04 (same)./7\n\n      Denius argues that it is clearly established\nthat the state could not require the release of\nconfidential information without at least some\ninterest to place in the balance and some\nmeasures limiting the use of the information and\nprotecting it from further disclosure. Although\nDenius alludes in his brief to the\nAuthorization’s effect on his privacy rights in\na broad range of confidential information, he\nonly discusses with specificity his interest in\nmedical and financial information. Therefore, we\naddress his privacy argument with respect to\nthese two types of information alone. See Gagan\nv. American Cablevision, Inc., 77 F.3d 951, 965\n(7th Cir. 1996) (holding that failure to\nadequately develop an argument on appeal\n\fconstitutes waiver).\n\n\n      a.   Medical Information\n\n      As discussed above, this Circuit has outlined a\nclearly established \"substantial\" right in the\nconfidentiality of medical information that can\nonly be overcome by a sufficiently strong state\ninterest. See Anderson, 72 F.3d at 522.\nTherefore, to the extent that the Authorization\nprovided for the release of medical records or\ncommunications,/8 Dunlap was on notice that this\ntype of information has constitutional protection\nin this Circuit and that the state cannot require\nits disclosure without a sufficient\ncountervailing interest. As Dunlap has provided\nno interest at this stage in the proceedings that\nwould justify requiring Denius to supply this\ninformation, we find he has not shown that he is\nentitled to qualified immunity on this issue. See\nGustafson v. Jones, 117 F.3d 1015, 1021 (7th Cir.\n1997) (recognizing that balancing tests \"produce\na wide gray area between the clearly legal and\nthe clearly illegal . . . . This does not mean,\nhowever, that legal certainty never exists when\nthe law demands the consideration of a number of\ndifferent factors.\"). We thus reverse the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendant on this issue and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n\n      b.   Financial Information\n\n      While this Court has concluded that there is a\ngeneral federal constitutional right of\nconfidentiality, we have discussed this right\nonly in the context of confidential medical\ninformation. See Anderson, 72 F.3d 518; Schaill,\n864 F.2d at 1322 n.19; Pesce, 830 F.2d 789.\nDenius now urges us to find that the right of\nconfidentiality applies to confidential financial\ninformation.\n\n      Seven of our sister circuits have found that\nthe constitutional right of privacy in\nconfidential information covers some financial\ndisclosures. See Sheets v. Salt Lake County, 45\nF.3d 1383, 1388 (10th Cir. 1995) (finding a\nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in\nmatters concerning \"marriage, finances, and\nbusiness\"); Doe v. City of New York, 15 F.3d 264,\n267 (2d Cir. 1994) (recognizing a\nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in\nfinancial information); Alexander v. Peffer, 993\nF.2d 1348 (8th Cir. 1993) (recognizing a\nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in\n\"highly personal medical or financial\ninformation\"); Walls v. City of Petersburg, 895\n\fF.2d 188, 194 (4th Cir. 1990) (same); Fraternal\nOrder of Police v. City of Philadelphia, 812 F.2d\n105, 115 (3d Cir. 1987) (same); Plante v.\nGonzalez, 575 F.2d 1119, 1135 (5th Cir. 1978)\n(recognizing a \"substantial\" privacy interest in\nconfidential financial information); see also\nJames v. City of Douglas, 941 F.2d 1539, 1543 n.7\n(11th Cir. 1991) (recognizing Fifth Circuit\nprecedent in this area finding a right to privacy\nin confidential financial information as\nbinding). The only circuit to explicitly disavow\nsuch a right, and the right of confidentiality in\ngeneral, is the Sixth Circuit. See J.P. v.\nDeSanti, 653 F.2d 1080, 1090 (6th Cir. 1981)\n(finding that no right of confidentiality exists\nunder the federal constitution); Cushall v.\nSundquist, 193 F.3d 466, 481 (6th Cir. 1999)\n(recognizing the continued vitality of the\nDeSanti decision). However, we explicitly\nrecognized our disagreement with the Sixth\nCircuit’s approach in Anderson where we agreed\nwith the majority of circuits that Whalen and\nNixon delineate a federal right of\nconfidentiality. 72 F.3d at 522./9\n\n      The Supreme Court has discussed the existence\nand extent of constitutional protection for\nconfidential information in terms of the type of\ninformation involved and the reasonable\nexpectation that that information would remain\nconfidential. Nixon, 433 U.S. at 465; see also\nWhalen, 429 U.S. at 604. Following this logic, we\nheld that medical information may be a form of\nprotected confidential information because of its\nintimate and personal nature. See Anderson, 72\nF.3d at 522; Pesce, 830 F.2d at 797. Our fellow\ncircuit courts have applied similar reasoning to\ndetermine whether information may receive\nprotection under the confidentiality branch of\nthe right to privacy. See In re Crawford, 194\nF.3d at 959; Doe, 15 F.3d at 267; Walls, 895 F.2d\nat 192, 194; Westinghouse, 638 F.2d at 579;\nPlante, 575 F.2d at 1134-35. Because confidential\nfinancial information may implicate substantial\nprivacy concerns and impact other fundamental\nrights, we agree with the overwhelming majority\nof our sister circuits that some types of\nfinancial information involve the degree and kind\nof confidentiality that is entitled to a measure\nof protection under the federal constitutional\nright of privacy.\n\n      In this case, the plaintiff has identified no\nspecific financial information that he claims\ndeserves constitutional protection. However, the\nAuthorization provides for the release of a\nvirtually limitless range of confidential\nfinancial information. Furthermore, the LCD has\nprovided no basis for requiring this information\nand no explanation for how it would tailor the\n\fgathering of the information to any need it might\nproffer. Most importantly, the LCD has provided\nno guarantee that the information obtained\npursuant to the Authorization would be kept\nconfidential and only used for a legitimate\ngovernment purpose. We conclude that this\nsweeping disclosure requirement, lacking any\nsafeguards against misuse or further disclosure,\nand supported by no justification, infringes\nDenius’s right of privacy in confidential\ninformation.\n\n      That some forms of confidential financial\ninformation may fall within the scope of the\nright of privacy was not clear in this Circuit at\nthe time Dunlap made his decision not to renew\nDenius’s contract. While there was a trend among\nthe majority of circuits in this direction, the\nconclusion was not unanimous. Therefore, we do\nnot find that the law in this area was so clearly\ndefined that a government official can be charged\nwith its knowledge. We conclude that Dunlap is\nshielded by qualified immunity for requiring\nDenius to disclose confidential financial\ninformation as a condition of employment, and we\naffirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the defendant on this issue./10\n\nC.   Equitable Relief\n\n      Denius next argues that the district court\nerred as a matter of law when it dismissed his\nclaims for equitable relief as barred by the\ndefendant’s qualified immunity.\n\n1.   Waiver\n\n      The defendant contends that Denius waived his\nright to appeal this issue because the district\ncourt’s dismissal of Denius’s claims for\nequitable relief was an oversight and not a legal\njudgment. The defendant asserts that Denius was\nrequired to file a Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief\nfrom Judgment calling the district court’s\nattention to this oversight and requesting its\ncorrection. The defendant argues that by failing\nto make a Rule 60(b) motion, Denius waived his\nability to raise this argument on appeal.\n\n      The defendant is correct that where a plaintiff\nis seeking relief from judgment that is most\nappropriately awarded by a trial court on a Rule\n60 motion, such as where the plaintiff is\nclaiming oversight, mistake or clerical error,\nthe plaintiff may waive his right to present that\ntype of argument on appeal if he did not make the\nappropriate Rule 60 motion below. See Chicago\nDowns Ass’n, Inc. v. Chase, 944 F.2d 366, 370-71\n(7th Cir. 1991) (finding that where plaintiff’s\nonly argument on appeal was that the district\n\fcourt’s judgment was inequitable because of\nattorney neglect, plaintiff waived this Rule\n60(b)-type argument on appeal because he failed\nto make the appropriate motion below); see also\nSecurities and Exchange Comm’n v. Mayhew, 121\nF.3d 44, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1997). However, in this\ncase, Denius is not contending that the district\ncourt overlooked his claim for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief or issued a mistaken judgment\nfor any of the reasons that would properly be\ncorrected by a Rule 60 motion. Rather, he claims\nthat the district court was fully aware of his\nclaims for both equitable and monetary relief but\nerroneously concluded that qualified immunity was\na bar to claims in both law and equity.\n\n      We agree with Denius’s interpretation of the\ndistrict court’s ruling. This is not a case where\nthe district court completely overlooked\nplaintiff’s claims for equitable relief. The\ndistrict court clearly states that it is\ndisposing of Denius’s claims for monetary and\nequitable relief through its summary judgment\nopinion. In addition, the district court did not\nlimit its discussion of qualified immunity solely\nto Denius’s claims for monetary relief but\napplied that doctrine to all of Denius’s claims.\nFurthermore, oral argument before the trial court\npertaining to the motion for summary judgment\nclearly indicates that the district court was\naware of, and took into consideration, Denius’s\nclaims for equitable as well as monetary relief.\nDenius appealed the district court’s conclusion\nof law on this matter directly to this Court, and\nit was proper for him to do so. While he may have\nfiled a Rule 60(b) motion asking the district\ncourt to reconsider this conclusion of law, he\nwas not required to do so, and he has not waived\nany of his arguments related to this matter on\nappeal. See Meinecke v. H & R Block of Houston,\n66 F.3d 77, 82 n.2 (5th Cir. 1995) (\"[I]t has\nnever been the case that a Rule 60(b) motion must\nbe filed as a prerequisite to appeal.\").\n\n2.   Denius’s Equitable Claims\n\n      The doctrine of qualified immunity does not\napply to claims for equitable relief. See Burgess\nv. Lowery, 2000 WL 30073, *1 (7th Cir. Jan. 18,\n2000) (\"There is no immunity from a suit for\n[equitable] relief.\"); Eberhardt v. O’Malley, 17\nF.3d 1023, 1028 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding\nqualified immunity \"irrelevant to the plaintiff’s\nrequest for an order that he be reinstated\"); see\nalso Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 314 n.6\n(1975) (stating that \"immunity from damages does\nnot ordinarily bar equitable relief as well\").\nTherefore, we hold that the district court erred\nin concluding that the defendants in this case\nare shielded from all liability for their actions\n\funder the qualified immunity doctrine. As\ndiscussed above, Denius has a First Amendment\nright in confidential communications with his\nattorney and a Fourteenth Amendment right in\nmaintaining the confidentiality of some medical\nand financial information. These rights are\nsubject to a balancing of interests to determine\nwhether the state has violated them. On the\npresent record, the defendant has presented no\njustification for the burden he has placed on\nthese rights by conditioning Denius’s employment\non relinquishing them, and he is not entitled to\nprevail on summary judgment. Therefore, we\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the defendant on Denius’s claims for\nequitable relief and remand these claims for\nfurther proceedings.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n      For the reasons stated above, we Affirm the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants on plaintiff’s claims for monetary\nrelief on the First Amendment attorney-client\nprivilege and Fourteenth Amendment financial\nprivacy claims; we Reverse the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants on plaintiff’s claim for monetary\nrelief on the Fourteenth Amendment medical\nprivacy claim as well as plaintiff’s claims for\nequitable relief; and we Remand this case to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n/1 Pursuant to Fed. R. App. Pro. 43(c)(2), we have\nadded Gary Sadler, the current Director of the\nLincoln Challenge Program, as a party to this\naction which involves claims for prospective\ninjunctive relief as well as monetary damages.\nHowever, for purposes of our discussion we will\nrefer to Dunlap as the defendant in this matter.\n\n/2 The only justification revealed on the record\nrelates to the LCP’s need for information\nconcerning the criminal background of its\nteachers. Denius has not objected to providing\nthis information and, indeed, has signed a\nconsent form without any time limit authorizing\nthe disclosure of information regarding his\ncriminal history. The record does not reveal any\njustification for requiring the additional\ninformation in the 1996 Authorization that is the\nsubject of this appeal.\n\n/3 It is irrelevant to our analysis that Dunlap did\nnot fire Denius but refused to renew his\ncontract, since Denius alleges that this decision\nwas made solely because he chose to exercise his\n\fconstitutional rights. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S.\nat 283 (holding that a plaintiff whose contract\nwas not renewed \"may nonetheless establish a\nclaim to reinstatement if the decision not to\nrehire him was made by reason of his exercise of\nconstitutionally protected First Amendment\nfreedoms\").\n\n/4 The defendant contends that Denius does not have\nstanding to raise a constitutional claim\nregarding the attorney-client privilege because\nhe was not involved in any past or present legal\nmatters at the time he was required to sign the\nrelease. However, this fact is not determinative\nof Denius’s standing in this case. In Shelton v.\nTucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960), and Keyishian v.\nBoard of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967), the\nSupreme Court held that requiring a teacher to\nreveal his associational memberships as a\ncondition of public employment was an\nunconstitutional burden on the teacher’s exercise\nof his First Amendment rights. The holdings in\nthese cases rest on the proposition that First\nAmendment activity may be unreasonably chilled\nwhen public employees are forced to choose\nbetween revealing protected activities to their\nemployer or keeping their jobs. See Keyishian,\n385 U.S. at 601-04; Shelton, 364 U.S. at 485-88;\ncf. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S.\n449, 462 (1958). As with the associational rights\nin those cases, the First Amendment right in this\ncase--the right to seek counsel from an attorney-\n-is arguably impaired by a requirement that\nattorney-client communications be made available\nto a public employer. We are particularly\nconcerned with a potential chilling effect in\nthis context because in certain cases it is only\nthrough the aid of an attorney that an individual\nis able to determine what his rights are and how\nto give them effect. In neither Shelton nor\nKeyishian were the plaintiff teachers required to\nshow that they were actually chilled from\nassociating with particular groups or persons\nbecause of the challenged regulations. Rather,\nthe plaintiffs alleged that they refused to\ncomply with the regulations requiring disclosure\nof associational membership and were fired\nbecause of this refusal. Likewise, because Denius\nalleges that he was required to chose between\nsigning a release that would potentially curtail\nan important First Amendment activity and keeping\nhis job, we find that he has standing to assert\na First Amendment claim.\n\n/5 The fact that the Authorization may affect future\ncommunications does not alter this result with\nrespect to the Sixth Amendment. Contrary to the\nFirst Amendment context, an individual cannot\nassert a claim based on a future violation of his\nSixth Amendment rights. Those rights may only be\n\fvindicated once they have attached. See McNeil,\n501 U.S. at 176.\n\n/6 To the extent that the Authorization duplicates\nthe release of criminal and educational records\nthat Denius signed when he first began working at\nLCD, he does not contest its validity. It is only\nthe disclosure of information above and beyond\nthat necessary to perform such a routine\nbackground check that is the subject of this\nappeal.\n\n/7 In Whalen, the Supreme Court balanced the\nfollowing factors: 1) the potential for public\ndisclosure of the information; 2) the extent to\nwhich the private information is already\ndisclosed to other individuals or institutions;\n3) the similarity of the disclosure in question\nto disclosures that have already taken place; 4)\nthe potential deterrent effect on the exercise of\nother constitutional liberties; and 5) the\nstate’s interest in the information. 429 U.S. at\n601-04.\n\n      In Nixon, the factors considered were: 1) the\nextent of the intrusion into the individual’s\nprivacy; 2) the individual’s status as a public\nfigure; 3) the expectation of privacy in the\nmaterials in question; 4) the importance of the\npublic interest; 5) the level of difficulty\ninvolved in segregating private from non-private\nmaterials; and 6) the measures taken to keep\nprivate materials from being publicly\ndisseminated or revealed. 433 U.S. at 465.\n\n      A number of our sister circuits have adopted a\nvariation of the balancing test articulated by\nthe Third Circuit that includes: 1) \"the type of\nrecord requested\"; 2) \"the information it does or\nmight contain\"; 3) \"the potential for harm in any\nsubsequent nonconsensual disclosure\"; 4) \"the\ninjury from disclosure to the relationship in\nwhich the record was generated\"; 5) \"the adequacy\nof safeguards to prevent unauthorized\ndisclosure\"; 6) \"the degree of need for access\";\n7) \"whether there is an express statutory\nmandate, articulated public policy, or other\nrecognizable public interest militating toward\naccess.\" United States v. Westinghouse Elec.\nCorp., 638 F.2d 570, 578 (3d Cir. 1980); see In\nre Crawford, 194 F.3d 954, 959 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n/8 The present record does not reveal whether the\nAuthorization extends to medical records or\ncommunications as Denius alleges. We leave this\nfactual determination to be resolved by the\ndistrict court.\n\n/9 The District of Columbia Circuit has recently\nexpressed \"grave doubts\" as to the existence of\n\fa federal right of confidentiality. See American\nFed’n of Gov’t Employees v. Department of Hous.\n& Urban Dev., 118 F.3d 786, 791 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\nHowever, that circuit recognized that it did not\n\"write on a blank slate\" and that the circuit’s\nearlier decisions indicated the existence of such\na right. Id. at 791-92. Similarly, the First\nCircuit has expressed concern regarding the\ncontours of this right but has declined to\naddress the issue. See Borucki v. Ryan, 827 F.2d\n836 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n/10 The Authorization also includes a release of\nliability to all persons giving information to\nthe LCP pursuant to the Authorization and to the\nLCP for any liability incurred as a result of\ngathering this information. Denius contends that\nrequiring him to release these potential legal\nclaims interferes with his right of access to the\ncourts and his property right in legal causes of\naction.\n\n      We have searched the record presented on appeal\nand can find no evidence that Denius raised\neither of these claims before the district court.\nWe have repeatedly held that \"[a]n issue not\npresented in the court below cannot be raised for\nthe first time on appeal and form a basis for\nreversal.\" Weeks v. Samsung Heavy Indus. Co.,\nLtd., 126 F.3d 926, 942 (7th Cir. 1997)\n(citations omitted). Therefore, we consider these\nissues waived and do not address them at this\ntime.\n\f",

Ronald Denius filed suit\nagainst Wayne Dunlap in his individual and\nofficial capacity as director of the Lincoln\nChallenge Program (\"LCP\") seeking injunctive,\ndeclaratory and monetary relief under 42 U.S.C.\nsec.sec. 1983 and 1988. Denius alleges that\nDunlap violated his constitutional rights when\nDunlap refused to renew his employment contract.\nThe district court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of the defendant on qualified immunity\ngrounds. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm\nin part and reverse and remand in part.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n      The LCP is an eighteen-month program for 16 to\n18 year old high school dropouts located on the\npremises of the now-closed Chanute Air Force\nBase. Students participating in the LCP live on\ncampus for the first five months of the program\nand then live off campus for the remainder of the\nprogram under the supervision of mentors. The LCP\nuses a military training method with the goal of\nteaching \"life skills\" instead of military skills\nand has as its objective that all participants\nobtain a GED. By 1996, the LCP had two 400\nstudent classes each year. In 1996, the LCP\nreceived 100 percent of its funding from the\nfederal government but was administered by the\nState of Illinois. Students who have felony\nconvictions are not eligible to participate in\n\fthe LCP.\n\n      In 1993, Wayne Dunlap, an Army colonel, became\nthe director of the LCP. Dunlap retired from the\nArmy in 1994 but continued to serve as director\nof the LCP, becoming an employee of the State of\nIllinois.\n\n      Ronald Denius is a retired Air Force technical\nsergeant who has earned two bachelor’s degrees\nand a master’s degree. At the time he retired\nfrom the Air Force, Denius had a \"top secret\"\nsecurity clearance. In March 1994, Denius began\nwork as a teacher at the LCP under a three-month\ncontract that was to last until the end of that\nschool year. Denius taught math, science, social\nstudies, language arts and writing skills. Denius\ndid not carry a weapon or have any duties beyond\nthose of a typical teacher.\n\n      On July 1, 1994, Denius signed a two-year\ncontract to continue teaching at the LCP. At this\ntime, he signed a release form that authorized\nthe LCP to perform a criminal background check\nand collect his educational records (the \"1994\nRelease\"). This release did not contain a time\nlimitation. Criminal background checks were\nperformed on the initial group of LCP instructors\nin 1994, but no further criminal background\nchecks were performed on LCP personnel until\n1996.\n\n      In July of 1996, Denius was offered the\nopportunity to renew his teaching contract with\nthe LCP provided he sign an Authorization for\nRelease of Personal Information\n(\"Authorization\"). This Authorization required\nDenius to consent to the release of considerably\nmore confidential information than provided in\nthe 1994 Release. LCP Director Dunlap had\nacquired the Authorization from Captain John\nMoraitis of the Illinois State Police who\ninformed Dunlap that the Authorization was used\nby the police for background checks of\ngubernatorial candidates and applicants for\nemployment with the State Police. Moraitis\nsuggested that Dunlap consult an attorney before\nusing the Authorization at the LCP, but Dunlap\ndid not heed this advice.\n\n      The Authorization provided in pertinent part:\n\nFor the period of one year from the execution of\nthis form I ________, do hereby authorize a\nreview of and full disclosure of all records\nconcerning myself to any duly authorized agent of\nthe Lincoln Challenge Program, whether the said\nrecords are of a public, private or confidential\nnature.\n\fThe intent of this authorization is to give my\nconsent for full and complete disclosure of\nrecords of educational institutions; financial or\ncredit institutions, including records of loans,\nthe records of commercial or retail credit\nagencies (including credit reports and/or\nratings); and other financial statements and\nrecords wherever filed; records maintained by the\nNational Personnel Records Center, the U.S.\nVeteran’s Administration, and County, State or\nFederal Law Enforcement Agencies; employment and\npre-employment records, including background\nreports, efficiency ratings, complaints or\ngrievances filed by or against me and the records\nand recollections of attorneys at law, or of\nother counsel, whether representing me or another\nperson in any case, either criminal or civil, in\nwhich I presently have, or have had an interest.\n\n. . . I also certify that any person(s) who may\nfurnish such information concerning me shall not\nbe held accountable for giving this information;\nand I do hereby release said person(s) from any\nand all liability which may be incurred as a\nresult of furnishing such information. I further\nrelease the Lincoln Challenge Program from any\nand all liability which may be incurred as a\nresult of collecting such information.\n\n      Denius signed the 1996 employment contract but\nrefused to sign the Authorization. Dunlap told\nDenius that his contract was not valid unless he\nsigned the Authorization. Denius attempted to\nresume his teaching responsibilities on August 2,\n1996, the beginning of the school term for that\nyear. When he did so, Dunlap informed Denius that\nhe could not be employed by the LCP unless he\nsigned the Authorization, and he asked Denius to\nleave the LCP premises. Denius’s refusal to sign\nthe Authorization was the sole reason his\nemployment contract with the LCP was not renewed.\n\n      At the time he required Denius to sign the\nAuthorization, Dunlap did not intend to use it\nfor any purpose other than to perform a routine\ncriminal background check because the LCP did not\nhave the funds to perform a more thorough\nbackground investigation. If the LCP had\npossessed the funds, Dunlap would have conducted\na more extensive background check. However,\nDunlap did not tell Denius that he only intended\nto use the Authorization for a routine criminal\nbackground check.\n\n      Denius filed suit under 42 U.S.C. sec.sec. 1983\nand 1988 asserting that Dunlap had violated his\nconstitutional rights under the First, Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendments by refusing to renew his\nemployment contract unless he signed the\nAuthorization. Denius sought injunctive,\n\fdeclaratory and monetary relief. The district\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of\nDunlap, finding that Dunlap was entitled to\nqualified immunity for all of the claims brought\nby Denius. Denius now appeals.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      The district court granted summary judgment to\nthe defendant and denied summary judgment to the\nplaintiff.

Monetary Relief\n\n      The district court concluded that Denius’s suit\nfor monetary damages was barred because Dunlap\nwas protected by qualified immunity. Denius\nargues that the district court erred in reaching\nthis conclusion.\n\n1.    Qualified Immunity\n\n      The doctrine of qualified immunity is an\naffirmative defense to allegations that a state\nofficial violated the constitutional rights of a\nplaintiff. Siegert v. Gilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112594\"><a href=\"/opinion/112594/siegert-v-gilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231\n(1991); Harlow v.

This defense is available only to state\nofficials who occupy positions with discretionary\nor policymaking authority, and it protects those\nindividuals solely when they are acting in their\nofficial capacity. Harlow, 457 U.S. at 816. These\nofficials \"are shielded from liability for civil\ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate\nclearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818; see Wilson v.\nLayne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, we\ndetermine whether the plaintiff’s claim states a\nviolation of his constitutional rights. Then, we\ndetermine whether those rights were clearly\nestablished at the time the violation occurred.\nSee Wilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1697; Khuans v. School\nDist. 100, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745418\"><a href=\"/opinion/745418/collette-a-khuans-v-school-district-110-james-nelson-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1013 (7th Cir. 1997).\nIf the rights were clearly established, the\nofficial may be liable for monetary damages and\nthe suit proceeds to the next stage. If the\n\frights were not clearly established, then the\nofficial is immune from suit and the claim is\ndismissed. See Richardson v. McKnight, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118137\"><a href=\"/opinion/118137/richardson-v-mcknight/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403 (1997) (\"[A] legal defense may well\ninvolve ’the essence of the wrong,’ while an\nimmunity frees one who enjoys it from a lawsuit\nwhether or not he acted wrongly.\"). Because the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity should not stand\nas an impediment to the clarification and\nevolution of a court’s articulation of\nconstitutional principles, we evaluate the\nconstitutionality of the official’s conduct even\nthough, in the end, he may not be held liable for\nmonetary damages flowing from that conduct. See\nWilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1697 (\"Deciding the\nconstitutional question before addressing the\nqualified immunity question . . . promotes\nclarity in the legal standards for official\nconduct, to the benefit of both the officers and\nthe general public.\"); County of Sacramento v.\nLewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Kernats v. O’Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678542\"><a href=\"/opinion/678542/cynthia-kernats-v-thomas-osullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176\n(7th Cir. 1994). A clearly established right is\none where \"[t]he contours of the right [are]\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official\nwould understand that what he is doing violates\nthat right.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640; see\nWilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1700. To determine whether\na right is clearly established, we look first to\ncontrolling Supreme Court precedent and our own\ncircuit decisions on the issue. Because there is\nan almost infinite variety of factual scenarios\nthat may be brought into the courtroom, a\nplaintiff need not point to cases that are\nidentical to the presently alleged constitutional\nviolation. However, \"the contours of the right\nmust have been established so that the\nunlawfulness of the defendant’s conduct would\nhave been apparent in light of existing law.\"\nCleveland-Perdue v. Brutsche, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527047\"><a href=\"/opinion/527047/linda-cleveland-perdue-successor-representative-and-administratrix-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430\n(7th Cir. 1989).\n\n      In the absence of controlling precedent, we\nbroaden our survey to include all relevant\ncaselaw in order to determine \"whether there was\nsuch a clear trend in the caselaw that we can say\nwith fair assurance that the recognition of the\nright by a controlling precedent was merely a\nquestion of time.\" Id. at 431. A split among\ncourts regarding the constitutionality of conduct\nanalogous to the conduct in question is an\nindication that the right was not clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation.\nSee Wilson, 119 S.Ct. at 1701 (\"If judges thus\ndisagree on a constitutional question, it is\nunfair to subject [the defendant] to money\ndamages for picking the losing side of the\n\fcontroversy.\"). In some rare cases, where the\nconstitutional violation is patently obvious, the\nplaintiff may not be required to present the\ncourt with any analogous cases, as widespread\ncompliance with a clearly apparent law may have\nprevented the issue from previously being\nlitigated. See Kernats, 35 F.3d at 1176.\n\n      The plaintiff Denius alleges that the defendant\ndirector of a state-run and federally-funded\neducational institution abused his position of\nauthority by requiring the plaintiff to sign the\nAuthorization as a condition of employment in\nviolation of his constitutional rights. In\nresponse to these allegations, the defendant\nDunlap asserts qualified immunity as an\naffirmative defense. It is unquestioned that\nDunlap, as the director of a public school, is\nentitled to qualified immunity for the decisions\nhe makes in hiring and firing the employees under\nhis supervision. See Khuans, 123 F.3d at 1013\n(holding that a school superintendent making the\ndecision not to renew the contract of a school\npsychologist was \"a government official\nperforming discretionary functions\" who was\nentitled to qualified immunity). Thus, even if we\nfind that Dunlap violated Denius’s constitutional\nrights by requiring him to sign the\nAuthorization, Dunlap is immune from suit for\ndamages under sec. 1983 if those rights were not\nclearly established at the time in question.\n\n2.   Pickering Balancing Test\n\n      It is clearly established that a public school\nteacher cannot have his employment conditioned\nupon his relinquishment of a constitutional right\nunless the interest of the school \"as an\nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the\npublic services it performs through its\nemployees,\" outweighs the individual interests of\nthe teacher in asserting his constitutional\nrights.

At\nthis stage of the proceedings, the defendant has\narticulated no interest that the LCP has in\nobtaining the information it was permitted to\ngather through the Authorization. Dunlap stated\nthat he did not intend to use any additional\ninformation beyond that which Denius had already\nconsented to release for the initial 1994\nbackground check, and Dunlap did not present any\nother justification for requiring the\ninformation./2 Because Dunlap has articulated no\ninterest that is promoted by requiring Denius to\nsign the Authorization, it is unnecessary for us\n\fto determine at this time whether the interests\nof the LCP as an employer outweigh the\nconstitutional rights of Denius.\n\n      Dunlap acknowledges that the only reason Denius\nwas dismissed from his teaching position was his\nrefusal to sign the Authorization./3 Therefore,\nif a finding that Denius has a clearly\nestablished constitutional right not to sign the\nAuthorization is made, then it follows that\nconditioning his employment as a public school\nteacher on the relinquishment of that right\nwithout any justification is a violation of a\nclearly established right for which Dunlap cannot\nreceive qualified immunity. See Keyishian v.\nBoard of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 605-06 (1967)\n(\"[T]he theory that public employment which may\nbe denied altogether may be subjected to any\nconditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has\nbeen uniformly rejected.\") (citations omitted).\n\n      We now examine each of Denius’s constitutional\nclaims to determine: 1) whether a constitutional\nright exists; and 2) whether that right was\nclearly established at the time in question.\n\n3.   Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n      The Authorization requires that Denius \"give\n[his] consent for full and complete disclosure of\n. . . the records and recollections of attorneys\nat law, or of other counsel, whether representing\n[him] or another person in any case, either\ncriminal or civil, in which [he] presently [has]\nor [has] had an interest.\" Denius argues that the\nintent and effect of this section of the\nAuthorization is to require him to waive his\nattorney-client privilege and allow the state\naccess to all information that would otherwise be\nprotected by this doctrine. Denius contends that\nthis compelled waiver violates his constitutional\nrights under the First and Sixth Amendments as\napplied to the states through the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106545\"><a href=\"/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963); Edwards v.

A court cannot compel\nrevelation of these communications through\ndiscovery or testimony in civil or criminal\nmatters. This doctrine is a common law privilege\nthat can be explicitly or implicitly waived by\nthe client and is subject to a number of\nrestrictions and exceptions. The privilege is\nimplicitly waived if the client communicates\ninformation to his attorney without the intent\nthat that information remain confidential. See\n\fgenerally Moore’s Federal Practice 3d sec. 26.49;\nWeinstein’s Federal Evidence 2d ch. 503.\n\n      In this case, we agree that Denius has been\nasked to waive his privilege of confidentiality\nregarding the information he communicates to an\nattorney as a condition of employment with the\nLCP. If Denius were to sign the Authorization,\nall previously protected communications with his\nattorney would no longer be privileged.\nFurthermore, the Authorization may jeopardize the\nattorney-client privilege for all future\ncommunications. Because these communications\nwould be made with the knowledge that Denius has\ngiven consent for his attorney to transmit the\ninformation to the LCD, they are no longer\nconfidential and, therefore, not protected by the\nprivilege. See Weinstein’s Federal Evidence sec.\n503.15(2); United States v.

Denius contends\nthat the attorney-client privilege implicates his\nright to counsel under the Sixth Amendment as\nwell as his rights of free speech, association\nand petition under the First Amendment. We\naddress each of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n      a.   Sixth Amendment\n\n      The Authorization includes the release of\ninformation related to all legal matters \"either\ncivil or criminal.\" Where the Sixth Amendment\nright to the effective assistance of counsel\nattaches, this right includes the ability to\nspeak candidly and confidentially with counsel\nfree from unreasonable government interference.\nSee Adams v.

If by\ncompelling an individual to reveal information\nthat he would rather keep confidential the state\nchills the individual’s ability to engage in\nprotected speech, the state has infringed the\nindividual’s First Amendment right in the\nprotected speech, unless it provides a sufficient\njustification for the required disclosure.

The level\nof justification required by the state will vary\ndepending on the nature of the speech involved.\nSee McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 347.\n\n      In this case, Denius alleges that the state is\ncompelling the revelation of information he would\nprefer to keep confidential by requiring him to\nwaive his attorney-client privilege. He argues\nthat this compelled revelation of confidential\ncommunications chills the protected speech\ninvolved in his consultation with an attorney on\nlegal matters. At this stage of the proceedings,\nDunlap has offered no reason for requiring that\nDenius waive his attorney-client privilege.\nTherefore, we need not decide and do not address\nthe level of justification required for the state\nto overcome an individual’s right to maintain\n\fconfidentiality in his legal communications with\nhis attorney. We merely conclude that absent\nappropriate justification the state cannot compel\nthe revelation of privileged attorney-client\ncommunications. Therefore, if the LCP had no\nbasis for requiring Denius to reveal confidential\nattorney-client communications, Dunlap violated\nDenius’s First Amendment rights when he refused\nto renew Denius’s contract solely because Denius\ndeclined to waive his attorney-client privilege.\n\n      However, the parameters of an individual’s First\nAmendment right to confidential communications\nwith his attorney were not clearly defined before\nthis incident occurred. There is no existing\nSupreme Court or Seventh Circuit precedent on\nthis issue, and we are only able to find two\ncases from fellow circuit courts articulating\nthis right. See DeLoach v.

Although\nDenius alludes in his brief to the\nAuthorization’s effect on his privacy rights in\na broad range of confidential information, he\nonly discusses with specificity his interest in\nmedical and financial information.

See Anderson, 72 F.3d at 522.\nTherefore, to the extent that the Authorization\nprovided for the release of medical records or\ncommunications,/8 Dunlap was on notice that this\ntype of information has constitutional protection\nin this Circuit and that the state cannot require\nits disclosure without a sufficient\ncountervailing interest. As Dunlap has provided\nno interest at this stage in the proceedings that\nwould justify requiring Denius to supply this\ninformation, we find he has not shown that he is\nentitled to qualified immunity on this issue.

However, we explicitly\nrecognized our disagreement with the Sixth\nCircuit’s approach in Anderson where we agreed\nwith the majority of circuits that Whalen and\nNixon delineate a federal right of\nconfidentiality. 72 F.3d at 522./9\n\n      The Supreme Court has discussed the existence\nand extent of constitutional protection for\nconfidential information in terms of the type of\ninformation involved and the reasonable\nexpectation that that information would remain\nconfidential. Nixon, 433 U.S. at 465; see also\nWhalen, 429 U.S. at 604. Following this logic, we\nheld that medical information may be a form of\nprotected confidential information because of its\nintimate and personal nature. See Anderson, 72\nF.3d at 522; Pesce, 830 F.2d at 797. Our fellow\ncircuit courts have applied similar reasoning to\ndetermine whether information may receive\nprotection under the confidentiality branch of\nthe right to privacy. See In re Crawford, 194\nF.3d at 959; Doe, 15 F.3d at 267; Walls, 895 F.2d\nat 192, 194; Westinghouse, 638 F.2d at 579;\nPlante, 575 F.2d at 1134-35. Because confidential\nfinancial information may implicate substantial\nprivacy concerns and impact other fundamental\nrights, we agree with the overwhelming majority\nof our sister circuits that some types of\nfinancial information involve the degree and kind\nof confidentiality that is entitled to a measure\nof protection under the federal constitutional\nright of privacy.\n\n      In this case, the plaintiff has identified no\nspecific financial information that he claims\ndeserves constitutional protection. However, the\nAuthorization provides for the release of a\nvirtually limitless range of confidential\nfinancial information. Furthermore, the LCD has\nprovided no basis for requiring this information\nand no explanation for how it would tailor the\n\fgathering of the information to any need it might\nproffer. Most importantly, the LCD has provided\nno guarantee that the information obtained\npursuant to the Authorization would be kept\nconfidential and only used for a legitimate\ngovernment purpose. We conclude that this\nsweeping disclosure requirement, lacking any\nsafeguards against misuse or further disclosure,\nand supported by no justification, infringes\nDenius’s right of privacy in confidential\ninformation.\n\n      That some forms of confidential financial\ninformation may fall within the scope of the\nright of privacy was not clear in this Circuit at\nthe time Dunlap made his decision not to renew\nDenius’s contract. While there was a trend among\nthe majority of circuits in this direction, the\nconclusion was not unanimous. Therefore, we do\nnot find that the law in this area was so clearly\ndefined that a government official can be charged\nwith its knowledge. We conclude that Dunlap is\nshielded by qualified immunity for requiring\nDenius to disclose confidential financial\ninformation as a condition of employment, and we\naffirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the defendant on this issue./10\n\nC.   Equitable Relief\n\n      Denius next argues that the district court\nerred as a matter of law when it dismissed his\nclaims for equitable relief as barred by the\ndefendant’s qualified immunity.\n\n1.   Waiver\n\n      The defendant contends that Denius waived his\nright to appeal this issue because the district\ncourt’s dismissal of Denius’s claims for\nequitable relief was an oversight and not a legal\njudgment. The defendant asserts that Denius was\nrequired to file a Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief\nfrom Judgment calling the district court’s\nattention to this oversight and requesting its\ncorrection. The defendant argues that by failing\nto make a Rule 60(b) motion, Denius waived his\nability to raise this argument on appeal.\n\n      The defendant is correct that where a plaintiff\nis seeking relief from judgment that is most\nappropriately awarded by a trial court on a Rule\n60 motion, such as where the plaintiff is\nclaiming oversight, mistake or clerical error,\nthe plaintiff may waive his right to present that\ntype of argument on appeal if he did not make the\nappropriate Rule 60 motion below. See Chicago\nDowns Ass’n, Inc. v. Chase, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567979\"><a href=\"/opinion/567979/chicago-downs-association-inc-v-dennis-r-chase-doing-business-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370-71\n(7th Cir. 1991) (finding that where plaintiff’s\nonly argument on appeal was that the district\n\fcourt’s judgment was inequitable because of\nattorney neglect, plaintiff waived this Rule\n60(b)-type argument on appeal because he failed\nto make the appropriate motion below); see also\nSecurities and Exchange Comm’n v. Mayhew, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744607\"><a href=\"/opinion/744607/fed-sec-l-rep-p-99496-securities-and-exchange-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1997). However, in this\ncase, Denius is not contending that the district\ncourt overlooked his claim for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief or issued a mistaken judgment\nfor any of the reasons that would properly be\ncorrected by a Rule 60 motion. Rather, he claims\nthat the district court was fully aware of his\nclaims for both equitable and monetary relief but\nerroneously concluded that qualified immunity was\na bar to claims in both law and equity.\n\n      We agree with Denius’s interpretation of the\ndistrict court’s ruling. This is not a case where\nthe district court completely overlooked\nplaintiff’s claims for equitable relief. The\ndistrict court clearly states that it is\ndisposing of Denius’s claims for monetary and\nequitable relief through its summary judgment\nopinion. In addition, the district court did not\nlimit its discussion of qualified immunity solely\nto Denius’s claims for monetary relief but\napplied that doctrine to all of Denius’s claims.\nFurthermore, oral argument before the trial court\npertaining to the motion for summary judgment\nclearly indicates that the district court was\naware of, and took into consideration, Denius’s\nclaims for equitable as well as monetary relief.\nDenius appealed the district court’s conclusion\nof law on this matter directly to this Court, and\nit was proper for him to do so. While he may have\nfiled a Rule 60(b) motion asking the district\ncourt to reconsider this conclusion of law, he\nwas not required to do so, and he has not waived\nany of his arguments related to this matter on\nappeal.

H & R Block of Houston,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704047\"><a href=\"/opinion/704047/jeannene-meinecke-v-h-r-block-of-houston-a-general-partnership-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82 n.2 (5th Cir. 1995) (\"[I]t has\nnever been the case that a Rule 60(b) motion must\nbe filed as a prerequisite to appeal.\").\n\n2.

As\ndiscussed above, Denius has a First Amendment\nright in confidential communications with his\nattorney and a Fourteenth Amendment right in\nmaintaining the confidentiality of some medical\nand financial information. These rights are\nsubject to a balancing of interests to determine\nwhether the state has violated them. On the\npresent record, the defendant has presented no\njustification for the burden he has placed on\nthese rights by conditioning Denius’s employment\non relinquishing them, and he is not entitled to\nprevail on summary judgment. Therefore, we\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the defendant on Denius’s claims for\nequitable relief and remand these claims for\nfurther proceedings.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n      For the reasons stated above, we Affirm the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ndefendants on plaintiff’s claims for monetary\nrelief on the First Amendment attorney-client\nprivilege and Fourteenth Amendment financial\nprivacy claims; we Reverse the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants on plaintiff’s claim for monetary\nrelief on the Fourteenth Amendment medical\nprivacy claim as well as plaintiff’s claims for\nequitable relief; and we Remand this case to the\ndistrict court for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n/1 Pursuant to Fed. R. App. Pro. 43(c)(2), we have\nadded Gary Sadler, the current Director of the\nLincoln Challenge Program, as a party to this\naction which involves claims for prospective\ninjunctive relief as well as monetary damages.\nHowever, for purposes of our discussion we will\nrefer to Dunlap as the defendant in this matter.\n\n/2 The only justification revealed on the record\nrelates to the LCP’s need for information\nconcerning the criminal background of its\nteachers. Denius has not objected to providing\nthis information and, indeed, has signed a\nconsent form without any time limit authorizing\nthe disclosure of information regarding his\ncriminal history. The record does not reveal any\njustification for requiring the additional\ninformation in the 1996 Authorization that is the\nsubject of this appeal.\n\n/3 It is irrelevant to our analysis that Dunlap did\nnot fire Denius but refused to renew his\ncontract, since Denius alleges that this decision\nwas made solely because he chose to exercise his\n\fconstitutional rights. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S.\nat 283 (holding that a plaintiff whose contract\nwas not renewed \"may nonetheless establish a\nclaim to reinstatement if the decision not to\nrehire him was made by reason of his exercise of\nconstitutionally protected First Amendment\nfreedoms\").\n\n/4 The defendant contends that Denius does not have\nstanding to raise a constitutional claim\nregarding the attorney-client privilege because\nhe was not involved in any past or present legal\nmatters at the time he was required to sign the\nrelease. However, this fact is not determinative\nof Denius’s standing in this case. In Shelton v.\nTucker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106142\"><a href=\"/opinion/106142/shelton-v-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1960), and Keyishian v.\nBoard of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1967), the\nSupreme Court held that requiring a teacher to\nreveal his associational memberships as a\ncondition of public employment was an\nunconstitutional burden on the teacher’s exercise\nof his First Amendment rights. The holdings in\nthese cases rest on the proposition that First\nAmendment activity may be unreasonably chilled\nwhen public employees are forced to choose\nbetween revealing protected activities to their\nemployer or keeping their jobs. See Keyishian,\n385 U.S. at 601-04; Shelton, 364 U.S. at 485-88;\ncf. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105746\"><a href=\"/opinion/105746/naacp-v-alabama-ex-rel-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462 (1958). As with the associational rights\nin those cases, the First Amendment right in this\ncase--the right to seek counsel from an attorney-\n-is arguably impaired by a requirement that\nattorney-client communications be made available\nto a public employer. We are particularly\nconcerned with a potential chilling effect in\nthis context because in certain cases it is only\nthrough the aid of an attorney that an individual\nis able to determine what his rights are and how\nto give them effect. In neither Shelton nor\nKeyishian were the plaintiff teachers required to\nshow that they were actually chilled from\nassociating with particular groups or persons\nbecause of the challenged regulations. Rather,\nthe plaintiffs alleged that they refused to\ncomply with the regulations requiring disclosure\nof associational membership and were fired\nbecause of this refusal. Likewise, because Denius\nalleges that he was required to chose between\nsigning a release that would potentially curtail\nan important First Amendment activity and keeping\nhis job, we find that he has standing to assert\na First Amendment claim.\n\n/5 The fact that the Authorization may affect future\ncommunications does not alter this result with\nrespect to the Sixth Amendment. Contrary to the\nFirst Amendment context, an individual cannot\nassert a claim based on a future violation of his\nSixth Amendment rights. Those rights may only be\n\fvindicated once they have attached. See McNeil,\n501 U.S. at 176.\n\n/6 To the extent that the Authorization duplicates\nthe release of criminal and educational records\nthat Denius signed when he first began working at\nLCD, he does not contest its validity. It is only\nthe disclosure of information above and beyond\nthat necessary to perform such a routine\nbackground check that is the subject of this\nappeal.\n\n/7 In Whalen, the Supreme Court balanced the\nfollowing factors: 1) the potential for public\ndisclosure of the information; 2) the extent to\nwhich the private information is already\ndisclosed to other individuals or institutions;\n3) the similarity of the disclosure in question\nto disclosures that have already taken place; 4)\nthe potential deterrent effect on the exercise of\nother constitutional liberties; and 5) the\nstate’s interest in the information. 429 U.S. at\n601-04.\n\n      In Nixon, the factors considered were: 1) the\nextent of the intrusion into the individual’s\nprivacy; 2) the individual’s status as a public\nfigure; 3) the expectation of privacy in the\nmaterials in question; 4) the importance of the\npublic interest; 5) the level of difficulty\ninvolved in segregating private from non-private\nmaterials; and 6) the measures taken to keep\nprivate materials from being publicly\ndisseminated or revealed. 433 U.S. at 465.\n\n      A number of our sister circuits have adopted a\nvariation of the balancing test articulated by\nthe Third Circuit that includes: 1) \"the type of\nrecord requested\"; 2) \"the information it does or\nmight contain\"; 3) \"the potential for harm in any\nsubsequent nonconsensual disclosure\"; 4) \"the\ninjury from disclosure to the relationship in\nwhich the record was generated\"; 5) \"the adequacy\nof safeguards to prevent unauthorized\ndisclosure\"; 6) \"the degree of need for access\";\n7) \"whether there is an express statutory\nmandate, articulated public policy, or other\nrecognizable public interest militating toward\naccess.\" United States v. Westinghouse Elec.\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"386024\"><a href=\"/opinion/386024/8-osh-casbna-2131-1980-oshd-cch-p-24879-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (3d Cir. 1980); see In\nre Crawford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766535\"><a href=\"/opinion/766535/in-re-laorphus-crawford-debtor-jack-ferm-v-united-states-trustee-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 959 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n/8 The present record does not reveal whether the\nAuthorization extends to medical records or\ncommunications as Denius alleges. We leave this\nfactual determination to be resolved by the\ndistrict court.\n\n/9 The District of Columbia Circuit has recently\nexpressed \"grave doubts\" as to the existence of\n\fa federal right of confidentiality. See American\nFed’n of Gov’t Employees v. Department of Hous.\n& Urban Dev., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743575\"><a href=\"/opinion/743575/american-federation-of-government-employeesafl-cio-v-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 791 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\nHowever, that circuit recognized that it did not\n\"write on a blank slate\" and that the circuit’s\nearlier decisions indicated the existence of such\na right. Id. at 791-92. Similarly, the First\nCircuit has expressed concern regarding the\ncontours of this right but has declined to\naddress the issue. See Borucki v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493606\"><a href=\"/opinion/493606/robert-a-borucki-v-w-michael-ryan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n/10 The Authorization also includes a release of\nliability to all persons giving information to\nthe LCP pursuant to the Authorization and to the\nLCP for any liability incurred as a result of\ngathering this information. Denius contends that\nrequiring him to release these potential legal\nclaims interferes with his right of access to the\ncourts and his property right in legal causes of\naction.\n\n      We have searched the record presented on appeal\nand can find no evidence that Denius raised\neither of these claims before the district court.\nWe have repeatedly held that \"[a]n issue not\npresented in the court below cannot be raised for\nthe first time on appeal and form a basis for\nreversal.\" Weeks v.
