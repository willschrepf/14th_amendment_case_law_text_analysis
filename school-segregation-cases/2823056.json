GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.  Trans World &lt;br&gt;Airlines furloughed forty-seven year old Richard Koster as part of &lt;br&gt;a 1994 work force reduction.  Koster brought suit, invoking &lt;br&gt;diversity jurisdiction, and a jury determined that TWA had engaged &lt;br&gt;in illegal age discrimination under Massachusetts law, and awarded &lt;br&gt;Koster $1,000,000 in damages.  The district court doubled the &lt;br&gt;damages pursuant to a Massachusetts statute and awarded prejudgment &lt;br&gt;interest and attorneys' fees.  TWA argues the district court erred &lt;br&gt;in these latter rulings and (1) by denying its motion for a &lt;br&gt;directed verdict and for judgment as a matter of law; (2) in the &lt;br&gt;admission of evidence; and (3) by refusing a requested supplemental &lt;br&gt;jury instruction.  We affirm the jury's verdict and award of &lt;br&gt;attorneys' fees, but reverse the award of damages and remand the &lt;br&gt;case for further proceedings on the issue of damages. &lt;br&gt;         TWA hired Koster in 1965, and he initially worked at &lt;br&gt;John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.  He was reassigned to Logan &lt;br&gt;Airport in Boston in 1977, and employed in various supervisory &lt;br&gt;positions until his furlough in August 1994.  Koster's last &lt;br&gt;position was Supervisor, Ground Operations.  He was responsible for &lt;br&gt;Logan's garage, mail, air freight, dining, commissary and store &lt;br&gt;areas.  He earned $40,000 per year.  TWA consistently promoted &lt;br&gt;Koster and also asked him to take on special assignments when &lt;br&gt;problems arose.  Koster's performance evaluations consistently &lt;br&gt;described him as an excellent employee. &lt;br&gt;         In response to TWA's financial difficulties over the last &lt;br&gt;decade, TWA has instituted pay cuts, reductions in force, and &lt;br&gt;restructurings. &lt;br&gt;         In August 1994, TWA's senior management asked Gordon &lt;br&gt;Humpherys, the station manager for Logan Airport, to implement a &lt;br&gt;reduction in force.  Humpherys was responsible for TWA's entire &lt;br&gt;station operations at Logan, and Koster reported directly to him.  &lt;br&gt;Specifically, TWA management told Humpherys to reduce six &lt;br&gt;supervisor positions to four. &lt;br&gt;         At trial, Humpherys explained that the reduction in force &lt;br&gt;would require the remaining four supervisors to do the work &lt;br&gt;formerly done by six.  Thus, his \"foremost concern\" was to retain &lt;br&gt;those supervisors \"who would provide the most productivity\" and be &lt;br&gt;best able to run the operation with a minimum of supervision and &lt;br&gt;direction.  Humpherys ultimately elected to keep Kathy Hobbs (age &lt;br&gt;44),  Glenn Hutmire (age 56), Henry Sledz (age 49), and Robinanne &lt;br&gt;Stancavage (age 25).  He selected Koster (age 49) and  Robert &lt;br&gt;Spencer (age 48) for furlough. &lt;br&gt;         Under TWA's Policies and Procedures, a management &lt;br&gt;employee selected for furlough remains eligible for recall for a &lt;br&gt;five-year period.  The employee may also elect to take a position &lt;br&gt;equivalent to the last position he or she held before entering &lt;br&gt;management.  Koster was entitled to take a position as a &lt;br&gt;transportation agent, which would have paid $26,000 per year.   He &lt;br&gt;elected, however, to take the furlough, hoping he would be &lt;br&gt;recalled.  Koster unsuccessfully applied for several openings at &lt;br&gt;TWA, but in the spring of 1995, Koster elected early retirement in &lt;br&gt;order to obtain his retirement benefits. &lt;br&gt;         Following his decision to retire, Koster opened up a &lt;br&gt;Minuteman printing franchise.  At the time of trial, Koster had yet &lt;br&gt;to take a salary.  Koster estimated his back-pay damages at &lt;br&gt;$159,175, and total losses for future pay at $120,819.  After the &lt;br&gt;furlough, Koster suffered from anxiety  and had trouble sleeping at &lt;br&gt;night.  He suffered from heartburn and had to take antacid pills on &lt;br&gt;a regular basis. &lt;br&gt;         Koster filed suit against TWA alleging age discrimination &lt;br&gt;in violation of the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act, &lt;br&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, and breach of contract.  The district &lt;br&gt;court dismissed the contract claim at the close of Koster's &lt;br&gt;evidence, and submitted the age claim to the jury.  The jury &lt;br&gt;returned a verdict for Koster, awarding $1,000,000.  The court &lt;br&gt;awarded $155,807.50 in attorneys' fees, prejudgment interest on all &lt;br&gt;but the front-pay portion of the damage award, and an additional &lt;br&gt;$1,000,000 pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  9, finding that &lt;br&gt;TWA acted with knowledge or reason to know that it violated the &lt;br&gt;provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4.  TWA appeals. &lt;br&gt;                                I. &lt;br&gt;         TWA first argues that the district court erred by denying &lt;br&gt;its motion for judgment as a matter of law because Koster failed &lt;br&gt;to:  (1) establish a prima facie case of age discrimination; and &lt;br&gt;(2)show that TWA's articulated non-discriminatory reasons for his &lt;br&gt;furlough were pretextual. &lt;br&gt;         We review de novo the trial court's decision to deny a &lt;br&gt;motion for judgment as a matter of law.  We view the evidence in &lt;br&gt;the light most favorable to Koster, drawing all reasonable &lt;br&gt;inferences in his favor.  See Snchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1994).  We \"may reverse the denial of such &lt;br&gt;a motion only if reasonable persons could not have reached the &lt;br&gt;conclusion that the jury embraced.\"  Id. &lt;br&gt;         In discrimination cases arising under Chapter 151B of the &lt;br&gt;Massachusetts law, courts have traditionally applied the three- &lt;br&gt;stage order of proof articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corporation &lt;br&gt;v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973).  See Lehman v. Prudential &lt;br&gt;Ins. Co., 74 F.3d 323, 327-28 (1st Cir. 1996); Blare v. Husky &lt;br&gt;Injection Molding Sys., 646 N.E.2d 111, 114-15 (Mass. 1995).  Under &lt;br&gt;that standard, a plaintiff who was terminated as part of a &lt;br&gt;reduction in force can generally establish a prima face case of &lt;br&gt;discrimination by showing that (1) he was at least forty years old; &lt;br&gt;(2) he met the employer's legitimate job performance expectations; &lt;br&gt;(3) he experienced adverse employment action; and (4) the employer &lt;br&gt;did not treat age neutrally, or that younger persons were retained &lt;br&gt;in the same position.  See LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1018 (1994). &lt;br&gt;         If the employee establishes a prima facie case, there is &lt;br&gt;a presumption that the employer engaged in impermissible age &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  See Kelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F.3d &lt;br&gt;335, 348 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 341 (1998).  To rebut &lt;br&gt;this presumption, the employer must articulate a legitimate non- &lt;br&gt;discriminatory reason for the employee's termination.  See id.  &lt;br&gt;This entails only a burden of production; the burden of persuasion &lt;br&gt;of discrimination remains with the employee.  See id.  Once the &lt;br&gt;employer has proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for &lt;br&gt;its adverse employment decision, the presumption generated by the &lt;br&gt;employee's prima facie case disappears, and the employee then has &lt;br&gt;the burden to prove that the reason advanced by the employer for &lt;br&gt;the adverse employment action constituted a mere pretext for &lt;br&gt;unlawful age discrimination.  See id.  Age discrimination &lt;br&gt;plaintiffs in Massachusetts have a lesser burden than those under &lt;br&gt;federal law.  Massachusetts law requires the employee to show only &lt;br&gt;pretext, whereas under First Circuit ADEA law, the mere showing of &lt;br&gt;pretext does not entitle plaintiff to a verdict.  See Mullin v.  &lt;br&gt;Raytheon Co., 164 F.3d 696, 699 (1st Cir. 1999), pet. for cert. &lt;br&gt;filed, May 5, 1999 (No. 98-1779); Kelley,140 F.3d at 348-49; Blare, &lt;br&gt;646 N.E.2d at 444-45.  Therefore, a plaintiff is entitled to &lt;br&gt;judgment on his claim if he establishes a prima facie case and &lt;br&gt;persuades the trier of fact that the employer's articulated &lt;br&gt;justification is pretextual.  See Kelley, 140 F.3d at 349. &lt;br&gt;                               -A-. &lt;br&gt;         TWA concedes that Koster was in the protected age group &lt;br&gt;and suffered an adverse employment action.  TWA argues, however, &lt;br&gt;that Koster did not establish a prima facie case of age &lt;br&gt;discrimination because he did not prove that he was replaced in his &lt;br&gt;position as Supervisor, Ground Operations, that TWA retained &lt;br&gt;younger employees in the same position, or that TWA's selection &lt;br&gt;process was not age neutral. &lt;br&gt;         TWA failed to preserve its challenge to the sufficiency &lt;br&gt;of Koster's prima facie case.  TWA's motions for directed verdict, &lt;br&gt;made at the close of Koster's evidence and at the close of all of &lt;br&gt;the evidence, challenged Koster's failure to prove pretext, not his &lt;br&gt;failure to prove a prima face case.  \"Appellate review may be &lt;br&gt;obtained only on the specific grounds stated in the motion for &lt;br&gt;directed verdict.\"  See Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell &lt;br&gt;Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 810 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 955 (1988). &lt;br&gt;         Moreover, we are persuaded that Koster established a &lt;br&gt;prima facie case of age discrimination.  Mesnick v. General Elec. &lt;br&gt;Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991)(burden is \"not onerous.\").  &lt;br&gt;In an answer to a special interrogatory, the jury found that Koster &lt;br&gt;established a prima facie case of age discrimination.  This finding &lt;br&gt;is well supported by the evidence.  Although no one took over &lt;br&gt;Koster's exact job, his duties were subsumed by other employees, &lt;br&gt;some of whom were younger, one substantially younger, than him.  In &lt;br&gt;a reduction in force, a prima facie case requires only that Koster &lt;br&gt;show that TWA did not treat age neutrally in deciding who to &lt;br&gt;furlough.  See Hidalgo v. Overseas  Condado Ins. Agencies, Inc., &lt;br&gt;120 F.3d 328, 333 (1st Cir. 1997).  Thus, sufficient evidence &lt;br&gt;existed to allow a reasonable jury to find that Koster met his &lt;br&gt;burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;                               -B-. &lt;br&gt;         TWA next argues that Koster failed to present sufficient &lt;br&gt;evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the reasons &lt;br&gt;for TWA's discharge were a pretext for age discrimination.  TWA &lt;br&gt;argues that Koster failed to show that TWA did not have a &lt;br&gt;legitimate need to reduce its work force at Logan, and furthermore, &lt;br&gt;did not address the fact that three of the four retained &lt;br&gt;supervisors were also in the protected age class. &lt;br&gt;         Koster does not argue, however, that the reduction in &lt;br&gt;force itself was pretextual. Instead, Koster relies on evidence &lt;br&gt;that TWA's stated reasons for selecting him for furlough were &lt;br&gt;false.  In answers to special interrogatories, the jury &lt;br&gt;specifically found that TWA \"had not presented credible evidence of &lt;br&gt;a legitimate business purpose for the furloughing of Mr. Koster in &lt;br&gt;August, 1994\" and that \"Koster has proven that the reason given by &lt;br&gt;[TWA] for his furlough in August 1994 was a pretext for age &lt;br&gt;discrimination.\"  The jury could reasonably make this finding of &lt;br&gt;pretext from the circumstances surrounding Humpherys's selection &lt;br&gt;process.  Humpherys testified that he selected Koster for furlough &lt;br&gt;because Humpherys \"didn't think he had sufficient people skills, &lt;br&gt;[and] his attitude was not sufficiently good for him to be able to &lt;br&gt;manage the operations on a regular basis.\"  Other witnesses &lt;br&gt;testified, however, that Koster had a very good relationship with &lt;br&gt;employees, and that he was knowledgeable, very professional, and a &lt;br&gt;hard worker.  Hutmire, one of the retained supervisors, testified &lt;br&gt;that Koster was a leader and \"a workaholic.\"  Koster had perfect &lt;br&gt;attendance record in fourteen out of seventeen years.    Koster had &lt;br&gt;been designated acting station manager to fill in for Humpherys on &lt;br&gt;at least two occasions. &lt;br&gt;         In addition, Humpherys testified that in evaluating the &lt;br&gt;supervisors he ranked Koster the \"lowest performer.\"  Humpherys &lt;br&gt;admitted, however, that Koster got the job done and that the &lt;br&gt;performance of his crews was satisfactory.  He ranked Koster even &lt;br&gt;below Spencer who he testified was \"constantly late\" and \"not a &lt;br&gt;strong supervisor.\" Humpherys ranked twenty-five year old &lt;br&gt;Stancavage as the second best supervisor of the group, even though &lt;br&gt;she had only three months of supervisory experience.  Koster hired &lt;br&gt;Stancavage in 1989 as a customer service agent.  She quit on &lt;br&gt;November 15, 1992, and  returned to TWA in June of 1993 as a part- &lt;br&gt;time customer service agent.  On January 24, 1994, she was promoted &lt;br&gt;to a full-time employee as a customer service agent in charge.  On &lt;br&gt;April 25, 1994, she became a Supervisor, Ground Operations.  There &lt;br&gt;was evidence that Stancavage had a full scholarship at M.I.T. and &lt;br&gt;was working for TWA only until she could return to school.  &lt;br&gt;Humpherys's primary explanation as to why he decided to retain &lt;br&gt;Stancavage over Koster was that she was  \"enormously creative\" and &lt;br&gt;\"very enthusiastic.\" &lt;br&gt;         After comparing the qualifications of Koster and &lt;br&gt;Stancavage, there is abundant evidence supporting the &lt;br&gt;conclusion that a reasonable employer would have found Koster &lt;br&gt;significantly more qualified than Stancavage, a twenty-five year &lt;br&gt;old employee with three months of supervisory experience.  The jury &lt;br&gt;could also reasonably conclude that Koster fit the selection &lt;br&gt;criteria established by Humpherys and that Stancavage did not.  &lt;br&gt;Koster obviously made a long-term commitment to working for TWA, &lt;br&gt;while evidence suggested that Stancavage planned to work for TWA &lt;br&gt;until she returned to school.  \"[A]n employer's asserted strong &lt;br&gt;reliance on subjective feelings about candidates may mask &lt;br&gt;discrimination.\"  Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1297 &lt;br&gt;(D.C. Cir. 1998)(\"enthusiasm\").  That three of the four retained &lt;br&gt;supervisors were in the protected age class is of little importance &lt;br&gt;because Koster need only show that TWA furloughed him because of &lt;br&gt;his age.  See O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 308, 312-13 (1996). Moreover, Stancavage is substantially &lt;br&gt;younger than Koster.  See id. at 313.  The jury's disbelief of the  &lt;br&gt;reasons set forth by TWA (particularly if the disbelief is &lt;br&gt;accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the &lt;br&gt;elements of the prima facie case, permit the jury to infer the &lt;br&gt;ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.  See St. Mary's Honor &lt;br&gt;Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511 (1993); Aka, 156 F.3d at 1294 &lt;br&gt;(discrimination can be inferred from evidence that employer &lt;br&gt;selected a significantly less qualified candidate).  Koster &lt;br&gt;established pretext by showing that TWA's proffered explanation is &lt;br&gt;unworthy of credence.  The court did not err in denying TWA's &lt;br&gt;motion for judgment as a matter of law. &lt;br&gt;                               II. &lt;br&gt;         TWA also argues that the district court's admitting a &lt;br&gt;section of the TWA Management Policy and Procedure Manual and  &lt;br&gt;allowing Koster to testify about other employees who had left TWA &lt;br&gt;was reversible error. &lt;br&gt;                               -A.- &lt;br&gt;         Section 10.66.01 of the Manual applied to salaried &lt;br&gt;personnel.  The policy section of the provision stated:  &lt;br&gt;\"[s]alaried seniority will determine the order of force reduction &lt;br&gt;and displacements of Salaried employees,\" and stated that in a &lt;br&gt;reduction in force, employees should be let go in the following &lt;br&gt;order:  contingent employees, probationary employees, regular part- &lt;br&gt;time or full-time employees. &lt;br&gt;           TWA contends that this provision applied only to &lt;br&gt;salaried employees and did not apply to Koster as a management &lt;br&gt;employee, and the district court abused its discretion in allowing &lt;br&gt;the jury to consider this evidence. &lt;br&gt;         We review evidentiary decisions of the trial court for &lt;br&gt;abuse of discretion.  Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d &lt;br&gt;92, 98 (1st Cir. 1997). &lt;br&gt;         The district court did not abuse its discretion in &lt;br&gt;admitting section 10.66.01 of the manual, or in refusing to give a &lt;br&gt;curative instruction.  Although TWA argues that this provision does &lt;br&gt;not apply to Koster because he was \"management\" and not \"salaried,\" &lt;br&gt;there was evidence that this provision applied to Koster.  First, &lt;br&gt;Koster's furlough letter from TWA referred Koster to section 10.66 &lt;br&gt;for \"a statement of his rights with respect to his seniority.\"   &lt;br&gt;Second, Koster testified that he thought that the provision applied &lt;br&gt;to all salaried management employees other than contract (union) &lt;br&gt;labor.  He explained that his employee records showed that he was &lt;br&gt;subject to a 14% pay cut in 1986 applicable to \"salaried\" &lt;br&gt;employees, and he believed the provision applied to him.  Thus, a &lt;br&gt;question of fact existed as to whether the provision applied to &lt;br&gt;Koster, and the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the &lt;br&gt;provision, or refusing to instruct the jury that the section did &lt;br&gt;not apply to Koster.  See Fed. R. Evid 104(b). &lt;br&gt;                               -B-. &lt;br&gt;         TWA further argues that the district court erred in &lt;br&gt;allowing Koster to testify about TWA's treatment of other  &lt;br&gt;employees and in denying TWA's request for a supplemental jury &lt;br&gt;instruction advising the jury that it could not consider such &lt;br&gt;anecdotal evidence.  TWA contends that the evidence lacked &lt;br&gt;foundation, and that there was no nexus between the other &lt;br&gt;terminations and Koster's termination.  TWA further argues that &lt;br&gt;allowing the evidence contradicted the district court's pre-trial &lt;br&gt;ruling that Koster's \"other employee\" evidence was not relevant. &lt;br&gt;         In a pre-trial order, the court granted TWA's motion in &lt;br&gt;limine prohibiting Koster from calling six former employees to &lt;br&gt;testify about how TWA furloughed them during other work force &lt;br&gt;reductions.  The district court reasoned that such testimony was &lt;br&gt;\"collateral,\" and would require the court to examine \"the &lt;br&gt;circumstances of each individual firing.\" &lt;br&gt;         At trial, Koster testified that during previous &lt;br&gt;reductions in force, he knew other employees over age fifty who TWA &lt;br&gt;had released or furloughed or who had retired.  Specifically, &lt;br&gt;Koster testified that he knew over one hundred front-line &lt;br&gt;management employees during his career, and only one retired at age &lt;br&gt;62 or older.  Koster gave examples of TWA employees he had known &lt;br&gt;who were over fifty and who had lost their jobs.   &lt;br&gt;         Koster's testimony did not violate the pre-trial order.  &lt;br&gt;The trial court ruling prohibited Koster from calling collateral &lt;br&gt;witnesses to testify about the circumstances surrounding the &lt;br&gt;furloughs of older supervisors.  The order did not prohibit Koster &lt;br&gt;from testifying about his own observations of what happened to &lt;br&gt;other employees at TWA.  During trial, the court clarified that it &lt;br&gt;would allow Koster to testify about what he perceived regarding the &lt;br&gt;reorganizations. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues that the anecdotal testimony is not indicative &lt;br&gt;of age discrimination or of pretext and should not have been &lt;br&gt;admitted.  TWA portrays the evidence as irrelevant and highly &lt;br&gt;prejudicial, warranting reversal. &lt;br&gt;         In Goldman v. First National Bank,985 F.2d 1113, 1119-21 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1993), we held that plaintiff's anecdotal evidence was &lt;br&gt;insufficient to form the basis for a finding of age animus.  In &lt;br&gt;Goldman, the employee had presented the affidavits of eight other &lt;br&gt;employees who stated that they were the oldest employee in their &lt;br&gt;unit and had been performing adequately when their employer &lt;br&gt;dismissed them pursuant to a reduction in force.  Id. at 1119.  We &lt;br&gt;held that \"evidence of this sort does little more than corroborate &lt;br&gt;what was undisputed:  that members of the protected class were &lt;br&gt;terminated as part of the reduction in force.\"  Id. (internal &lt;br&gt;quotations omitted). &lt;br&gt;         Contrary to TWA's argument, Goldman did not hold that &lt;br&gt;anecdotal evidence is not admissible and always prejudicial. &lt;br&gt;Goldman simply held that the anecdotal evidence presented could &lt;br&gt;not, by itself, establish age animus.  Id. at 1119.  Accord &lt;br&gt;Shorette v. Rite Aid Inc., 155 F.3d 8, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998);  &lt;br&gt;LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 847.  Indeed, we recently observed that \"while &lt;br&gt;proof of a general atmosphere of discrimination is not the &lt;br&gt;equivalent of proof of discrimination . . . it may add color to an &lt;br&gt;employer's decisionmaking process.\"  Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys. &lt;br&gt;Corp., 150 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir. 1998)(internal quotations &lt;br&gt;omitted).  Here, as in Brennan, Koster's  anecdotal evidence was &lt;br&gt;just a part of his age discrimination picture.  The admissibility &lt;br&gt;of Koster's anecdotal evidence was a judgment call, as was the &lt;br&gt;refusal of the requested instruction.  Exclusion would not have &lt;br&gt;been an abuse of discretion, but neither was admission. &lt;br&gt;                               III. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues the district court abused its discretion in &lt;br&gt;denying TWA's motion for remittitur or, in the alternative, a new &lt;br&gt;trial on damages.  See Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., &lt;br&gt;518 U.S. 415, 433 (1996) (abuse of discretion standard).  TWA, &lt;br&gt;however, bears a heavy burden of showing that an award is \"grossly &lt;br&gt;excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or &lt;br&gt;so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to &lt;br&gt;stand.\"  Havinga v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp. Co., 24 F.3d 1480, &lt;br&gt;1484 (1st Cir. 1994).  We will not disturb an award of damages &lt;br&gt;because it is extremely generous or because we think the damages &lt;br&gt;are considerably less.  See id.  We will only reverse an award if &lt;br&gt;it is so grossly disproportionate to any injury established by the &lt;br&gt;evidence as to be unconscionable as a matter of law.  See id.; &lt;br&gt;Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1198 (1st Cir. 1998) &lt;br&gt;(remittitur appropriate only when verdict \"so exorbitant\"). &lt;br&gt;         TWA does not attack the entire damage award.  TWA first &lt;br&gt;takes issue with the damages for emotional distress.  Koster's  &lt;br&gt;evidence of lost wages (back pay and front pay) amounted to &lt;br&gt;approximately $284,000; thus, TWA argues that the balance of &lt;br&gt;$716,000 represents damages for emotional distress and is &lt;br&gt;excessive.  Koster responds that the $716,000 does not necessarily &lt;br&gt;constitute emotional damages, and the jury could have easily &lt;br&gt;decided that Koster's total losses for front pay far exceeded the &lt;br&gt;$120,819 he testified about. &lt;br&gt;         Koster's testimony, however, as to back pay and future &lt;br&gt;pay was quite specific.  His attorney in closing argument &lt;br&gt;reiterated that his economic damages totaled $283,995.  In the face &lt;br&gt;of such firm evidence of economic damage, we cannot say that the &lt;br&gt;jury could reasonably conclude Koster was damaged above and beyond &lt;br&gt;what he said his damages were.  See Kelley, 140 F.3d at 355-56. &lt;br&gt;         Although determining whether damages for emotional &lt;br&gt;distress are excessive is difficult, such damages are not immune &lt;br&gt;from review.  See LaBonte, 678 N.E.2d at 861-62.  The Massachusetts &lt;br&gt;Supreme Judicial Court held that a $550,000 award for emotional &lt;br&gt;distress was excessive in LaBonte.  In that case, a law firm fired &lt;br&gt;an employee after the employee developed multiple sclerosis.  Id. &lt;br&gt;at 855-56.  There was evidence that the employee was depressed and &lt;br&gt;that \"his confidence was shattered\" by the termination.  Id. at &lt;br&gt;861.  Although the court acknowledged that the employee suffered &lt;br&gt;from depression and sought counseling, it nevertheless concluded &lt;br&gt;that the $550,000 award for emotional distress was excessive.  Id. &lt;br&gt;at 861-62.  The court reasoned that the damage award was grossly &lt;br&gt;disproportionate to the evidence of injury.  The plaintiff had not &lt;br&gt;been hospitalized and never took medication to combat his &lt;br&gt;depression, and his depression abated after he found a new job.  &lt;br&gt;Id.  The court concluded that his depression, while real and &lt;br&gt;significant, did not rise to the level awarded by the jury.  Id.  &lt;br&gt;The case was remanded to the trial court to determine the amount of &lt;br&gt;remittitur. &lt;br&gt;         Although testimony from a mental health expert is not &lt;br&gt;required to sustain an award for emotional distress, the absence of &lt;br&gt;such evidence is useful in comparing the injury to the award of &lt;br&gt;damages.  For example, in Snchez, a jury awarded $150,000 in &lt;br&gt;emotional distress damages to a plaintiff in an age discrimination &lt;br&gt;case.  37 F.3d at 723.  The district court reduced the award to &lt;br&gt;$37,500, and we affirmed.  Id. at 723, 726.  The plaintiff in &lt;br&gt;Snchez testified about the humiliation he suffered from losing his &lt;br&gt;job and filing for bankruptcy.  We indicated that although &lt;br&gt;emotional damages are warranted even without medical or psychiatric &lt;br&gt;evidence, the lack of such evidence is relevant to the amount of &lt;br&gt;award.  Id. at 724 n.13. &lt;br&gt;         One of the highest emotional distress judgments in &lt;br&gt;Massachusetts was awarded in Westinghouse Electric Supply Corp. v.  &lt;br&gt;Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, No. CIV. A. 97- &lt;br&gt;4267E, 1999 WL 140492 (Mass. Dist. Ct. Mar. 5, 1999).  In that &lt;br&gt;case, Westinghouse fired an experienced salesman after he developed &lt;br&gt;Crohn's disease.  Id. at *1-2.  The claimant suffered from severe &lt;br&gt;depression, insomnia, constant diarrhea, and stomach pain, and the &lt;br&gt;Massachusetts Commission awarded him $250,000 for emotional &lt;br&gt;distress.  Id. at *3.  The Massachusetts court affirmed the award, &lt;br&gt;concluding it was \"within the realm of other emotional distress &lt;br&gt;awards, and that \"the exacerbation of his illness and consequent &lt;br&gt;termination may support a higher award of damages.\"  Id. at *10-11, &lt;br&gt;n. 16 and 17.  Although the evidence of injury was much more severe &lt;br&gt;in Westinghouse, the claimant received about a half a million &lt;br&gt;dollars less than Koster.  See id. at *10 (humiliation, depression, &lt;br&gt;inability to eat, constant diarrhea and pain).  In Westinghouse, &lt;br&gt;there was no evidence that the claimant found another job as Koster &lt;br&gt;did. &lt;br&gt;         Despite the strict standard of review, courts have &lt;br&gt;ordered  remittiturs in a number of cases.  See, e.g., Fontaine v.  &lt;br&gt;Ebtec Corp., 613 N.E.2d 881, 883-84 &amp; n.3 (Mass. 1993) (emotional &lt;br&gt;distress damages reduced from $80,000 to $25,000); Powers v. H.B. &lt;br&gt;Smith Co., 679 N.E.2d at 252, 254 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997)(damage &lt;br&gt;award (front-pay and emotional distress) reduced from $750,000 to &lt;br&gt;$350,000); Kelley, 140 F.3d at 345 (emotional distress damages &lt;br&gt;reduced from $250,000 to $150,000); United States v. Snchez, 37 &lt;br&gt;F.3d at 723 (emotional distress damages awarded under Puerto Rico &lt;br&gt;statute reduced from $150,000 to $37,500).  Accord Hetzel v.  &lt;br&gt;County of Prince William, 89 F.3d 169, 173 (4th Cir. 1996)(award of &lt;br&gt;$500,000 grossly excessive), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1028 (1996); &lt;br&gt;see also Brownlie v. Kanzaki Specialty Papers, Inc., 691 N.E.2d &lt;br&gt;953, 955 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998) (emotional distress damages of &lt;br&gt;$50,000). &lt;br&gt;         There is no doubt that Koster suffered emotionally &lt;br&gt;following his furlough.  Koster had worked for TWA for over twenty- &lt;br&gt;five years and was devoted to his job.  His seniority status at TWA &lt;br&gt;allowed him job and vacation flexibility, and he found his work &lt;br&gt;extremely gratifying.  After the furlough, Koster had trouble &lt;br&gt;sleeping and was anxious.  A vacation to Hawaii \"did not go well.\"  &lt;br&gt;He took antacid pills on a regular basis.  His new job requires him &lt;br&gt;to work more, and he earns less.  His family life has suffered.  &lt;br&gt;His wife has had to return to work, and he is not able to &lt;br&gt;participate as fully in the activities of his four children.  &lt;br&gt;Following LaBonte, however, we believe the award is grossly &lt;br&gt;disproportionate to the evidence of emotional distress.  There was &lt;br&gt;no evidence that Koster ever sought medical treatment or suffered &lt;br&gt;any long-term depression or incapacitation.  Koster was able to &lt;br&gt;open up a business of his own and anticipates taking a salary &lt;br&gt;within two years.  Although we acknowledge that the furlough of &lt;br&gt;Koster was particularly painful because of his devotion to TWA, we &lt;br&gt;also recognize that he could have remained with TWA, albeit in a &lt;br&gt;different job with a reduced salary. &lt;br&gt;         Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence of injury was &lt;br&gt;grossly disproportionate to the award for emotional distress, and &lt;br&gt;is excessive as a matter of law.  We recognize that we have the &lt;br&gt;option of selecting a reduced damages figure ourselves based on the &lt;br&gt;evidence adduced at trial, or remanding the case to the district &lt;br&gt;court for a determination of damages.  See, e.g., Anthony v. GMD &lt;br&gt;Airline Services, Inc., 17 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir. 1994);   &lt;br&gt;Marchant v. Dayton Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 836 F.2d 695, 704 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1988). &lt;br&gt;         Although we recognize the esoteric nature of damages for &lt;br&gt;emotional distress, in view of the fact that the district court &lt;br&gt;denied TWA's motion for a remittitur, we think the best course is &lt;br&gt;to follow the \"maximum recovery rule\" authorized by this circuit.  &lt;br&gt;See id.  Under that rule, we condition our ruling that a new trial &lt;br&gt;on damages is appropriate on Koster's declining to remit our &lt;br&gt;determination of Koster's damages.  After our careful review of the &lt;br&gt;record and thoughtful consideration of other cases, we believe the &lt;br&gt;evidence of emotional distress would support a maximum recovery of &lt;br&gt;emotional damages of $250,000.  We believe that amount represents &lt;br&gt;the highest amount of damages for emotional distress for which &lt;br&gt;there is adequate evidentiary support.  We thus grant a new trial &lt;br&gt;on the issue of emotional damages only, and condition our order on &lt;br&gt;Koster's declining to remit $466,000 of the total amount awarded by &lt;br&gt;the jury. &lt;br&gt;                               IV. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues the trial court erred in awarding  Koster  &lt;br&gt;double damages.  TWA contends that Chapter 151b requires the court &lt;br&gt;to make a specific finding to warrant the imposition of double &lt;br&gt;damages.  TWA speculates that the district court \"may have &lt;br&gt;construed\" the double damages provision as mandatory, not &lt;br&gt;discretionary. &lt;br&gt;         Following the jury's verdict, the district court simply &lt;br&gt;stated:  \"Okay.  The issue now is whether I am going to double the &lt;br&gt;award.  And I am.  So, I will make ... a finding that I think it is &lt;br&gt;appropriate to double the jury award.  And I will do it.\"  The &lt;br&gt;court's May 18, 1998, order tracked the statutory language of Mass. &lt;br&gt;Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  9.  TWA states that Brownlie, 691 N.E.2d at &lt;br&gt;962, requires the district court to make specific findings that the &lt;br&gt;employer knew that the discriminatory act violated the age &lt;br&gt;discrimination law.  Although the court's findings in Brownlie were &lt;br&gt;much more specific than the court here, we are convinced that the &lt;br&gt;specificity was gratuitous and not required by the statute. &lt;br&gt;         Neither the statute nor the relevant case law requires &lt;br&gt;that the district court do anything more than enter a finding that &lt;br&gt;the employer acted with knowledge or reason to know that it &lt;br&gt;violated the anti-discrimination statute.  See Brownlie, 691 N.E.2d &lt;br&gt;at 962.  See also Kelley, 140 F.3d at 345 (multiplying damages by &lt;br&gt;2.25).  The statute simply requires a finding that the employer &lt;br&gt;satisfied the knowledge element of the statute. &lt;br&gt;         Although the district court did not provide a detailed &lt;br&gt;analysis supporting its finding, the judge affirmatively found that &lt;br&gt;it was appropriate to double the damage award.  This statement is &lt;br&gt;easily translated into a finding, supported by the record, that TWA &lt;br&gt;acted with knowledge or reason to know.  The evidence of &lt;br&gt;Humpherys's explanation for selecting Koster for furlough was not &lt;br&gt;credible. TWA's vice president of employee relations, Thibaudeau, &lt;br&gt;testified about TWA's policy prohibiting age discrimination, and &lt;br&gt;about how the policy was communicated to all managers.  This &lt;br&gt;evidence supports the finding that TWA acted with knowledge of its &lt;br&gt;violation of Massachusetts law. &lt;br&gt;         TWA also suggests that the district court \"may\" have &lt;br&gt;thought double damages were mandatory.  TWA refers us to the &lt;br&gt;multiple damage provision of the consumer protection law, which &lt;br&gt;courts have recognized requires more than a \"knowing violation,\" &lt;br&gt;despite the statutory language which suggests a less rigorous &lt;br&gt;standard.  See Cambridge Plating Co. v. NAPCO, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, &lt;br&gt;770 (1st Cir. 1996).  First, it is obvious from the court's finding &lt;br&gt;that it only considered the doubling mandatory if TWA's conduct met &lt;br&gt;the standard of knowledge required by the statute.  Fontaine &lt;br&gt;instructs that double damages are mandatory if the knowledge &lt;br&gt;standard of the statute is met, and that triple damages are &lt;br&gt;discretionary.  See 613 N.E.2d at 322 (\"a certain recovery of at &lt;br&gt;least double damages\"). Although the language of the provision in &lt;br&gt;the consumer protection statute is similar, none of the cases under &lt;br&gt;the age discrimination statute suggest that the knowledge &lt;br&gt;requirement is higher than that suggested by the statute.  See, &lt;br&gt;e.g., Brownlie, 691 N.E.2d at 962;  cf. Cambridge Plating, 85 F.3d &lt;br&gt;at 770-771.  The court did not err in awarding double damages. &lt;br&gt;                                V. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues that the attorneys' fee award of $155,807.50 &lt;br&gt;is excessive.  Our review of the attorneys' fee award is governed &lt;br&gt;by Massachusetts Law.  Krewson v. City of Quincy, 74 F.3d 15, 17 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1996). &lt;br&gt;         The amount of a reasonable attorneys' fee, awarded on the &lt;br&gt;basis of statutory authority, is largely discretionary.  See &lt;br&gt;Fontaine, 613 N.E.2d at 890. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues that the fee should be vacated because the &lt;br&gt;court abused its discretion in awarding Koster his full attorneys' &lt;br&gt;fees.  TWA contends that the case did not warrant the participation &lt;br&gt;of three attorneys, and the court should have reduced the award to &lt;br&gt;take into account that Koster lost on his breach of contract claim. &lt;br&gt;         The district court, however, determined that the fees &lt;br&gt;were reasonable.  The judge stated: &lt;br&gt;                      Very frankly, I find the hours reasonable, &lt;br&gt;           the amount of time spent.  The fact that &lt;br&gt;           there were three lawyers on one side and &lt;br&gt;           two on the other side, I don't find &lt;br&gt;           disproportionate.  It is probably fair, &lt;br&gt;           especially that you, Mr. DeGiacomo, are &lt;br&gt;           one of the most experienced and highly &lt;br&gt;           regarded trial lawyers in the city.  You &lt;br&gt;           could almost argue that it takes three &lt;br&gt;           against one, that three against one makes &lt;br&gt;           it fair. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;         TWA does not challenge the billing rate of the attorneys &lt;br&gt;nor does it suggest that the time was duplicative.  It simply &lt;br&gt;argues that \"this was not a case warranting the investment of three &lt;br&gt;attorneys.\" &lt;br&gt;         We find no abuse of discretion in allowing recovery for &lt;br&gt;the time spent by three attorneys.  TWA does not suggest the time &lt;br&gt;spent by three attorneys was duplicative, just that it was &lt;br&gt;unnecessary.  After consideration, the district court rejected this &lt;br&gt;argument.  Counsel's time spent pursuing unsuccessful claims, &lt;br&gt;however, is generally non-compensable \"unless it can be shown that &lt;br&gt;the [unsuccessful and successful] claims were interconnected.\"  &lt;br&gt;Krewson, 74 F.3d at 19.  \"Interconnection\" can be found when the &lt;br&gt;\"claims include[] a common core of facts or were based on related &lt;br&gt;legal theories.\"  Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 940 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1992) (quotations omitted).  Although it may be true that Koster's &lt;br&gt;breach of contract and discrimination claims arose out of the same &lt;br&gt;cluster of facts, we need not decide this question because it is &lt;br&gt;the fee target's burden to show a basis for segregability.  See id. &lt;br&gt;at 941.  TWA did not meet this burden either before the district &lt;br&gt;court or this court. &lt;br&gt;         We affirm the judgment of the district court except for &lt;br&gt;the award of damages.  We order a new trial on the issue of &lt;br&gt;emotional damages only if Koster decides not to remit $932,000 &lt;br&gt;(plus any interest accrued).&lt;/pre&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</p>\n\n</div>",

GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.  Trans World &lt;br&gt;Airlines furloughed forty-seven year old Richard Koster as part of &lt;br&gt;a 1994 work force reduction.  Koster brought suit, invoking &lt;br&gt;diversity jurisdiction, and a jury determined that TWA had engaged &lt;br&gt;in illegal age discrimination under Massachusetts law, and awarded &lt;br&gt;Koster $1,000,000 in damages.  The district court doubled the &lt;br&gt;damages pursuant to a Massachusetts statute and awarded prejudgment &lt;br&gt;interest and attorneys' fees.  TWA argues the district court erred &lt;br&gt;in these latter rulings and (1) by denying its motion for a &lt;br&gt;directed verdict and for judgment as a matter of law; (2) in the &lt;br&gt;admission of evidence; and (3) by refusing a requested supplemental &lt;br&gt;jury instruction.  We affirm the jury's verdict and award of &lt;br&gt;attorneys' fees, but reverse the award of damages and remand the &lt;br&gt;case for further proceedings on the issue of damages. &lt;br&gt;         TWA hired Koster in 1965, and he initially worked at &lt;br&gt;John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.  He was reassigned to Logan &lt;br&gt;Airport in Boston in 1977, and employed in various supervisory &lt;br&gt;positions until his furlough in August 1994.  Koster's last &lt;br&gt;position was Supervisor, Ground Operations.  He was responsible for &lt;br&gt;Logan's garage, mail, air freight, dining, commissary and store &lt;br&gt;areas.  He earned $40,000 per year.  TWA consistently promoted &lt;br&gt;Koster and also asked him to take on special assignments when &lt;br&gt;problems arose.  Koster's performance evaluations consistently &lt;br&gt;described him as an excellent employee. &lt;br&gt;         In response to TWA's financial difficulties over the last &lt;br&gt;decade, TWA has instituted pay cuts, reductions in force, and &lt;br&gt;restructurings. &lt;br&gt;         In August 1994, TWA's senior management asked Gordon &lt;br&gt;Humpherys, the station manager for Logan Airport, to implement a &lt;br&gt;reduction in force.  Humpherys was responsible for TWA's entire &lt;br&gt;station operations at Logan, and Koster reported directly to him.  &lt;br&gt;Specifically, TWA management told Humpherys to reduce six &lt;br&gt;supervisor positions to four. &lt;br&gt;         At trial, Humpherys explained that the reduction in force &lt;br&gt;would require the remaining four supervisors to do the work &lt;br&gt;formerly done by six.  Thus, his \"foremost concern\" was to retain &lt;br&gt;those supervisors \"who would provide the most productivity\" and be &lt;br&gt;best able to run the operation with a minimum of supervision and &lt;br&gt;direction.  Humpherys ultimately elected to keep Kathy Hobbs (age &lt;br&gt;44),  Glenn Hutmire (age 56), Henry Sledz (age 49), and Robinanne &lt;br&gt;Stancavage (age 25).  He selected Koster (age 49) and  Robert &lt;br&gt;Spencer (age 48) for furlough. &lt;br&gt;         Under TWA's Policies and Procedures, a management &lt;br&gt;employee selected for furlough remains eligible for recall for a &lt;br&gt;five-year period.  The employee may also elect to take a position &lt;br&gt;equivalent to the last position he or she held before entering &lt;br&gt;management.  Koster was entitled to take a position as a &lt;br&gt;transportation agent, which would have paid $26,000 per year.   He &lt;br&gt;elected, however, to take the furlough, hoping he would be &lt;br&gt;recalled.  Koster unsuccessfully applied for several openings at &lt;br&gt;TWA, but in the spring of 1995, Koster elected early retirement in &lt;br&gt;order to obtain his retirement benefits. &lt;br&gt;         Following his decision to retire, Koster opened up a &lt;br&gt;Minuteman printing franchise.  At the time of trial, Koster had yet &lt;br&gt;to take a salary.  Koster estimated his back-pay damages at &lt;br&gt;$159,175, and total losses for future pay at $120,819.  After the &lt;br&gt;furlough, Koster suffered from anxiety  and had trouble sleeping at &lt;br&gt;night.  He suffered from heartburn and had to take antacid pills on &lt;br&gt;a regular basis. &lt;br&gt;         Koster filed suit against TWA alleging age discrimination &lt;br&gt;in violation of the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act, &lt;br&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, and breach of contract.  The district &lt;br&gt;court dismissed the contract claim at the close of Koster's &lt;br&gt;evidence, and submitted the age claim to the jury.  The jury &lt;br&gt;returned a verdict for Koster, awarding $1,000,000.  The court &lt;br&gt;awarded $155,807.50 in attorneys' fees, prejudgment interest on all &lt;br&gt;but the front-pay portion of the damage award, and an additional &lt;br&gt;$1,000,000 pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  9, finding that &lt;br&gt;TWA acted with knowledge or reason to know that it violated the &lt;br&gt;provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4.  TWA appeals. &lt;br&gt;                                I. &lt;br&gt;         TWA first argues that the district court erred by denying &lt;br&gt;its motion for judgment as a matter of law because Koster failed &lt;br&gt;to:  (1) establish a prima facie case of age discrimination; and &lt;br&gt;(2)show that TWA's articulated non-discriminatory reasons for his &lt;br&gt;furlough were pretextual. &lt;br&gt;         We review de novo the trial court's decision to deny a &lt;br&gt;motion for judgment as a matter of law.  We view the evidence in &lt;br&gt;the light most favorable to Koster, drawing all reasonable &lt;br&gt;inferences in his favor.  See Snchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1994).  We \"may reverse the denial of such &lt;br&gt;a motion only if reasonable persons could not have reached the &lt;br&gt;conclusion that the jury embraced.\"  Id. &lt;br&gt;         In discrimination cases arising under Chapter 151B of the &lt;br&gt;Massachusetts law, courts have traditionally applied the three- &lt;br&gt;stage order of proof articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corporation &lt;br&gt;v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-05 (1973).  See Lehman v.

Great American Ins. Co., 6 &lt;br&gt;F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></span> (1994). &lt;br&gt;         If the employee establishes a prima facie case, there is &lt;br&gt;a presumption that the employer engaged in impermissible age &lt;br&gt;discrimination.  See Kelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F.3d &lt;br&gt;335, 348 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></span> (1998).  To rebut &lt;br&gt;this presumption, the employer must articulate a legitimate non- &lt;br&gt;discriminatory reason for the employee's termination.  See id.  &lt;br&gt;This entails only a burden of production; the burden of persuasion &lt;br&gt;of discrimination remains with the employee.  See id.  Once the &lt;br&gt;employer has proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for &lt;br&gt;its adverse employment decision, the presumption generated by the &lt;br&gt;employee's prima facie case disappears, and the employee then has &lt;br&gt;the burden to prove that the reason advanced by the employer for &lt;br&gt;the adverse employment action constituted a mere pretext for &lt;br&gt;unlawful age discrimination.  See id.  Age discrimination &lt;br&gt;plaintiffs in Massachusetts have a lesser burden than those under &lt;br&gt;federal law.  Massachusetts law requires the employee to show only &lt;br&gt;pretext, whereas under First Circuit ADEA law, the mere showing of &lt;br&gt;pretext does not entitle plaintiff to a verdict.  See Mullin v.  &lt;br&gt;Raytheon Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760463\"><a href=\"/opinion/760463/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1174-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45696-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span>, 699 (1st Cir. 1999), pet. for cert. &lt;br&gt;filed, May 5, 1999 (No. 98-1779); Kelley,140 F.3d at 348-49; Blare, &lt;br&gt;646 N.E.2d at 444-45.  Therefore, a plaintiff is entitled to &lt;br&gt;judgment on his claim if he establishes a prima facie case and &lt;br&gt;persuades the trier of fact that the employer's articulated &lt;br&gt;justification is pretextual.  See Kelley, 140 F.3d at 349. &lt;br&gt;                               -A-. &lt;br&gt;         TWA concedes that Koster was in the protected age group &lt;br&gt;and suffered an adverse employment action.  TWA argues, however, &lt;br&gt;that Koster did not establish a prima facie case of age &lt;br&gt;discrimination because he did not prove that he was replaced in his &lt;br&gt;position as Supervisor, Ground Operations, that TWA retained &lt;br&gt;younger employees in the same position, or that TWA's selection &lt;br&gt;process was not age neutral. &lt;br&gt;         TWA failed to preserve its challenge to the sufficiency &lt;br&gt;of Koster's prima facie case.  TWA's motions for directed verdict, &lt;br&gt;made at the close of Koster's evidence and at the close of all of &lt;br&gt;the evidence, challenged Koster's failure to prove pretext, not his &lt;br&gt;failure to prove a prima face case.  \"Appellate review may be &lt;br&gt;obtained only on the specific grounds stated in the motion for &lt;br&gt;directed verdict.\"  See Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell &lt;br&gt;Bd. of Realtors, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508416\"><a href=\"/opinion/508416/wells-real-estate-inc-v-greater-lowell-board-of-realtors/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 810 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 955 (1988). &lt;br&gt;         Moreover, we are persuaded that Koster established a &lt;br&gt;prima facie case of age discrimination.  Mesnick v. General Elec. &lt;br&gt;Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 823 (1st Cir. 1991)(burden is \"not onerous.\").  &lt;br&gt;In an answer to a special interrogatory, the jury found that Koster &lt;br&gt;established a prima facie case of age discrimination.  This finding &lt;br&gt;is well supported by the evidence.  Although no one took over &lt;br&gt;Koster's exact job, his duties were subsumed by other employees, &lt;br&gt;some of whom were younger, one substantially younger, than him.  In &lt;br&gt;a reduction in force, a prima facie case requires only that Koster &lt;br&gt;show that TWA did not treat age neutrally in deciding who to &lt;br&gt;furlough.  See Hidalgo v. Overseas  Condado Ins. Agencies, Inc., &lt;br&gt;120 F.3d 328, 333 (1st Cir. 1997).  Thus, sufficient evidence &lt;br&gt;existed to allow a reasonable jury to find that Koster met his &lt;br&gt;burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination. &lt;br&gt;                               -B-. &lt;br&gt;         TWA next argues that Koster failed to present sufficient &lt;br&gt;evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the reasons &lt;br&gt;for TWA's discharge were a pretext for age discrimination.  TWA &lt;br&gt;argues that Koster failed to show that TWA did not have a &lt;br&gt;legitimate need to reduce its work force at Logan, and furthermore, &lt;br&gt;did not address the fact that three of the four retained &lt;br&gt;supervisors were also in the protected age class. &lt;br&gt;         Koster does not argue, however, that the reduction in &lt;br&gt;force itself was pretextual. Instead, Koster relies on evidence &lt;br&gt;that TWA's stated reasons for selecting him for furlough were &lt;br&gt;false.  In answers to special interrogatories, the jury &lt;br&gt;specifically found that TWA \"had not presented credible evidence of &lt;br&gt;a legitimate business purpose for the furloughing of Mr. Koster in &lt;br&gt;August, 1994\" and that \"Koster has proven that the reason given by &lt;br&gt;[TWA] for his furlough in August 1994 was a pretext for age &lt;br&gt;discrimination.\"  The jury could reasonably make this finding of &lt;br&gt;pretext from the circumstances surrounding Humpherys's selection &lt;br&gt;process.  Humpherys testified that he selected Koster for furlough &lt;br&gt;because Humpherys \"didn't think he had sufficient people skills, &lt;br&gt;[and] his attitude was not sufficiently good for him to be able to &lt;br&gt;manage the operations on a regular basis.\"  Other witnesses &lt;br&gt;testified, however, that Koster had a very good relationship with &lt;br&gt;employees, and that he was knowledgeable, very professional, and a &lt;br&gt;hard worker.  Hutmire, one of the retained supervisors, testified &lt;br&gt;that Koster was a leader and \"a workaholic.\"  Koster had perfect &lt;br&gt;attendance record in fourteen out of seventeen years.    Koster had &lt;br&gt;been designated acting station manager to fill in for Humpherys on &lt;br&gt;at least two occasions. &lt;br&gt;         In addition, Humpherys testified that in evaluating the &lt;br&gt;supervisors he ranked Koster the \"lowest performer.\"  Humpherys &lt;br&gt;admitted, however, that Koster got the job done and that the &lt;br&gt;performance of his crews was satisfactory.  He ranked Koster even &lt;br&gt;below Spencer who he testified was \"constantly late\" and \"not a &lt;br&gt;strong supervisor.\" Humpherys ranked twenty-five year old &lt;br&gt;Stancavage as the second best supervisor of the group, even though &lt;br&gt;she had only three months of supervisory experience.  Koster hired &lt;br&gt;Stancavage in 1989 as a customer service agent.  She quit on &lt;br&gt;November 15, 1992, and  returned to TWA in June of 1993 as a part- &lt;br&gt;time customer service agent.  On January 24, 1994, she was promoted &lt;br&gt;to a full-time employee as a customer service agent in charge.  On &lt;br&gt;April 25, 1994, she became a Supervisor, Ground Operations.  There &lt;br&gt;was evidence that Stancavage had a full scholarship at M.I.T. and &lt;br&gt;was working for TWA only until she could return to school.  &lt;br&gt;Humpherys's primary explanation as to why he decided to retain &lt;br&gt;Stancavage over Koster was that she was  \"enormously creative\" and &lt;br&gt;\"very enthusiastic.\" &lt;br&gt;         After comparing the qualifications of Koster and &lt;br&gt;Stancavage, there is abundant evidence supporting the &lt;br&gt;conclusion that a reasonable employer would have found Koster &lt;br&gt;significantly more qualified than Stancavage, a twenty-five year &lt;br&gt;old employee with three months of supervisory experience.  The jury &lt;br&gt;could also reasonably conclude that Koster fit the selection &lt;br&gt;criteria established by Humpherys and that Stancavage did not.  &lt;br&gt;Koster obviously made a long-term commitment to working for TWA, &lt;br&gt;while evidence suggested that Stancavage planned to work for TWA &lt;br&gt;until she returned to school.  \"[A]n employer's asserted strong &lt;br&gt;reliance on subjective feelings about candidates may mask &lt;br&gt;discrimination.\"  Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758304\"><a href=\"/opinion/758304/etim-u-aka-v-washington-hospital-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span>, 1297 &lt;br&gt;(D.C. Cir. 1998)(\"enthusiasm\").  That three of the four retained &lt;br&gt;supervisors were in the protected age class is of little importance &lt;br&gt;because Koster need only show that TWA furloughed him because of &lt;br&gt;his age.  See O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 &lt;br&gt;U.S. 308, 312-13 (1996). Moreover, Stancavage is substantially &lt;br&gt;younger than Koster.  See id. at 313.  The jury's disbelief of the  &lt;br&gt;reasons set forth by TWA (particularly if the disbelief is &lt;br&gt;accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the &lt;br&gt;elements of the prima facie case, permit the jury to infer the &lt;br&gt;ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.  See St. Mary's Honor &lt;br&gt;Ctr. v. Hicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 511 (1993); Aka, 156 F.3d at 1294 &lt;br&gt;(discrimination can be inferred from evidence that employer &lt;br&gt;selected a significantly less qualified candidate).  Koster &lt;br&gt;established pretext by showing that TWA's proffered explanation is &lt;br&gt;unworthy of credence.  The court did not err in denying TWA's &lt;br&gt;motion for judgment as a matter of law. &lt;br&gt;                               II. &lt;br&gt;         TWA also argues that the district court's admitting a &lt;br&gt;section of the TWA Management Policy and Procedure Manual and  &lt;br&gt;allowing Koster to testify about other employees who had left TWA &lt;br&gt;was reversible error. &lt;br&gt;                               -A.- &lt;br&gt;         Section 10.66.01 of the Manual applied to salaried &lt;br&gt;personnel.  The policy section of the provision stated:  &lt;br&gt;\"[s]alaried seniority will determine the order of force reduction &lt;br&gt;and displacements of Salaried employees,\" and stated that in a &lt;br&gt;reduction in force, employees should be let go in the following &lt;br&gt;order:  contingent employees, probationary employees, regular part- &lt;br&gt;time or full-time employees. &lt;br&gt;           TWA contends that this provision applied only to &lt;br&gt;salaried employees and did not apply to Koster as a management &lt;br&gt;employee, and the district court abused its discretion in allowing &lt;br&gt;the jury to consider this evidence. &lt;br&gt;         We review evidentiary decisions of the trial court for &lt;br&gt;abuse of discretion.  Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d &lt;br&gt;92, 98 (1st Cir. 1997). &lt;br&gt;         The district court did not abuse its discretion in &lt;br&gt;admitting section 10.66.01 of the manual, or in refusing to give a &lt;br&gt;curative instruction.  Although TWA argues that this provision does &lt;br&gt;not apply to Koster because he was \"management\" and not \"salaried,\" &lt;br&gt;there was evidence that this provision applied to Koster.  First, &lt;br&gt;Koster's furlough letter from TWA referred Koster to section 10.66 &lt;br&gt;for \"a statement of his rights with respect to his seniority.\"   &lt;br&gt;Second, Koster testified that he thought that the provision applied &lt;br&gt;to all salaried management employees other than contract (union) &lt;br&gt;labor.  He explained that his employee records showed that he was &lt;br&gt;subject to a 14% pay cut in 1986 applicable to \"salaried\" &lt;br&gt;employees, and he believed the provision applied to him.  Thus, a &lt;br&gt;question of fact existed as to whether the provision applied to &lt;br&gt;Koster, and the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the &lt;br&gt;provision, or refusing to instruct the jury that the section did &lt;br&gt;not apply to Koster.  See Fed. R. Evid 104(b). &lt;br&gt;                               -B-. &lt;br&gt;         TWA further argues that the district court erred in &lt;br&gt;allowing Koster to testify about TWA's treatment of other  &lt;br&gt;employees and in denying TWA's request for a supplemental jury &lt;br&gt;instruction advising the jury that it could not consider such &lt;br&gt;anecdotal evidence.  TWA contends that the evidence lacked &lt;br&gt;foundation, and that there was no nexus between the other &lt;br&gt;terminations and Koster's termination.  TWA further argues that &lt;br&gt;allowing the evidence contradicted the district court's pre-trial &lt;br&gt;ruling that Koster's \"other employee\" evidence was not relevant. &lt;br&gt;         In a pre-trial order, the court granted TWA's motion in &lt;br&gt;limine prohibiting Koster from calling six former employees to &lt;br&gt;testify about how TWA furloughed them during other work force &lt;br&gt;reductions.  The district court reasoned that such testimony was &lt;br&gt;\"collateral,\" and would require the court to examine \"the &lt;br&gt;circumstances of each individual firing.\" &lt;br&gt;         At trial, Koster testified that during previous &lt;br&gt;reductions in force, he knew other employees over age fifty who TWA &lt;br&gt;had released or furloughed or who had retired.  Specifically, &lt;br&gt;Koster testified that he knew over one hundred front-line &lt;br&gt;management employees during his career, and only one retired at age &lt;br&gt;62 or older.  Koster gave examples of TWA employees he had known &lt;br&gt;who were over fifty and who had lost their jobs.   &lt;br&gt;         Koster's testimony did not violate the pre-trial order.  &lt;br&gt;The trial court ruling prohibited Koster from calling collateral &lt;br&gt;witnesses to testify about the circumstances surrounding the &lt;br&gt;furloughs of older supervisors.  The order did not prohibit Koster &lt;br&gt;from testifying about his own observations of what happened to &lt;br&gt;other employees at TWA.  During trial, the court clarified that it &lt;br&gt;would allow Koster to testify about what he perceived regarding the &lt;br&gt;reorganizations. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues that the anecdotal testimony is not indicative &lt;br&gt;of age discrimination or of pretext and should not have been &lt;br&gt;admitted.  TWA portrays the evidence as irrelevant and highly &lt;br&gt;prejudicial, warranting reversal. &lt;br&gt;         In Goldman v. First National Bank,985 F.2d 1113, 1119-21 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1993), we held that plaintiff's anecdotal evidence was &lt;br&gt;insufficient to form the basis for a finding of age animus.  In &lt;br&gt;Goldman, the employee had presented the affidavits of eight other &lt;br&gt;employees who stated that they were the oldest employee in their &lt;br&gt;unit and had been performing adequately when their employer &lt;br&gt;dismissed them pursuant to a reduction in force.  Id. at 1119.  We &lt;br&gt;held that \"evidence of this sort does little more than corroborate &lt;br&gt;what was undisputed:  that members of the protected class were &lt;br&gt;terminated as part of the reduction in force.\"  Id. (internal &lt;br&gt;quotations omitted). &lt;br&gt;         Contrary to TWA's argument, Goldman did not hold that &lt;br&gt;anecdotal evidence is not admissible and always prejudicial. &lt;br&gt;Goldman simply held that the anecdotal evidence presented could &lt;br&gt;not, by itself, establish age animus.  Id. at 1119.  Accord &lt;br&gt;Shorette v.

Center for Humanities, Inc., &lt;br&gt;518 U.S. 415, 433 (1996) (abuse of discretion standard).  TWA, &lt;br&gt;however, bears a heavy burden of showing that an award is \"grossly &lt;br&gt;excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or &lt;br&gt;so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to &lt;br&gt;stand.\"  Havinga v.

A. 97- &lt;br&gt;4267E, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">140492</span></span> (Mass. Dist. Ct. Mar. 5, 1999).  In that &lt;br&gt;case, Westinghouse fired an experienced salesman after he developed &lt;br&gt;Crohn's disease.  Id. at *1-2.  The claimant suffered from severe &lt;br&gt;depression, insomnia, constant diarrhea, and stomach pain, and the &lt;br&gt;Massachusetts Commission awarded him $250,000 for emotional &lt;br&gt;distress.  Id. at *3.  The Massachusetts court affirmed the award, &lt;br&gt;concluding it was \"within the realm of other emotional distress &lt;br&gt;awards, and that \"the exacerbation of his illness and consequent &lt;br&gt;termination may support a higher award of damages.\"  Id. at *10-11, &lt;br&gt;n. 16 and 17.  Although the evidence of injury was much more severe &lt;br&gt;in Westinghouse, the claimant received about a half a million &lt;br&gt;dollars less than Koster.  See id. at *10 (humiliation, depression, &lt;br&gt;inability to eat, constant diarrhea and pain).  In Westinghouse, &lt;br&gt;there was no evidence that the claimant found another job as Koster &lt;br&gt;did. &lt;br&gt;         Despite the strict standard of review, courts have &lt;br&gt;ordered  remittiturs in a number of cases.  See, e.g., Fontaine v.  &lt;br&gt;Ebtec Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></span>, 883-84 &amp; n.3 (Mass. 1993) (emotional &lt;br&gt;distress damages reduced from $80,000 to $25,000); Powers v.

Kanzaki Specialty Papers, Inc., 691 N.E.2d &lt;br&gt;953, 955 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998) (emotional distress damages of &lt;br&gt;$50,000). &lt;br&gt;         There is no doubt that Koster suffered emotionally &lt;br&gt;following his furlough.  Koster had worked for TWA for over twenty- &lt;br&gt;five years and was devoted to his job.  His seniority status at TWA &lt;br&gt;allowed him job and vacation flexibility, and he found his work &lt;br&gt;extremely gratifying.  After the furlough, Koster had trouble &lt;br&gt;sleeping and was anxious.  A vacation to Hawaii \"did not go well.\"  &lt;br&gt;He took antacid pills on a regular basis.  His new job requires him &lt;br&gt;to work more, and he earns less.  His family life has suffered.  &lt;br&gt;His wife has had to return to work, and he is not able to &lt;br&gt;participate as fully in the activities of his four children.  &lt;br&gt;Following LaBonte, however, we believe the award is grossly &lt;br&gt;disproportionate to the evidence of emotional distress.  There was &lt;br&gt;no evidence that Koster ever sought medical treatment or suffered &lt;br&gt;any long-term depression or incapacitation.  Koster was able to &lt;br&gt;open up a business of his own and anticipates taking a salary &lt;br&gt;within two years.  Although we acknowledge that the furlough of &lt;br&gt;Koster was particularly painful because of his devotion to TWA, we &lt;br&gt;also recognize that he could have remained with TWA, albeit in a &lt;br&gt;different job with a reduced salary. &lt;br&gt;         Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence of injury was &lt;br&gt;grossly disproportionate to the award for emotional distress, and &lt;br&gt;is excessive as a matter of law.  We recognize that we have the &lt;br&gt;option of selecting a reduced damages figure ourselves based on the &lt;br&gt;evidence adduced at trial, or remanding the case to the district &lt;br&gt;court for a determination of damages.  See, e.g., Anthony v. GMD &lt;br&gt;Airline Services, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195230\"><a href=\"/opinion/195230/anthony-v-gmd-airline-serv/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 495 (1st Cir. 1994);   &lt;br&gt;Marchant v. Dayton Tire &amp; Rubber Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499728\"><a href=\"/opinion/499728/john-s-marchant-v-the-dayton-tire-rubber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span>, 704 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1988). &lt;br&gt;         Although we recognize the esoteric nature of damages for &lt;br&gt;emotional distress, in view of the fact that the district court &lt;br&gt;denied TWA's motion for a remittitur, we think the best course is &lt;br&gt;to follow the \"maximum recovery rule\" authorized by this circuit.  &lt;br&gt;See id.  Under that rule, we condition our ruling that a new trial &lt;br&gt;on damages is appropriate on Koster's declining to remit our &lt;br&gt;determination of Koster's damages.  After our careful review of the &lt;br&gt;record and thoughtful consideration of other cases, we believe the &lt;br&gt;evidence of emotional distress would support a maximum recovery of &lt;br&gt;emotional damages of $250,000.  We believe that amount represents &lt;br&gt;the highest amount of damages for emotional distress for which &lt;br&gt;there is adequate evidentiary support.  We thus grant a new trial &lt;br&gt;on the issue of emotional damages only, and condition our order on &lt;br&gt;Koster's declining to remit $466,000 of the total amount awarded by &lt;br&gt;the jury. &lt;br&gt;                               IV. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues the trial court erred in awarding  Koster  &lt;br&gt;double damages.  TWA contends that Chapter 151b requires the court &lt;br&gt;to make a specific finding to warrant the imposition of double &lt;br&gt;damages.  TWA speculates that the district court \"may have &lt;br&gt;construed\" the double damages provision as mandatory, not &lt;br&gt;discretionary. &lt;br&gt;         Following the jury's verdict, the district court simply &lt;br&gt;stated:  \"Okay.  The issue now is whether I am going to double the &lt;br&gt;award.  And I am.  So, I will make ... a finding that I think it is &lt;br&gt;appropriate to double the jury award.  And I will do it.\"  The &lt;br&gt;court's May 18, 1998, order tracked the statutory language of Mass. &lt;br&gt;Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  9.  TWA states that Brownlie, 691 N.E.2d at &lt;br&gt;962, requires the district court to make specific findings that the &lt;br&gt;employer knew that the discriminatory act violated the age &lt;br&gt;discrimination law.  Although the court's findings in Brownlie were &lt;br&gt;much more specific than the court here, we are convinced that the &lt;br&gt;specificity was gratuitous and not required by the statute. &lt;br&gt;         Neither the statute nor the relevant case law requires &lt;br&gt;that the district court do anything more than enter a finding that &lt;br&gt;the employer acted with knowledge or reason to know that it &lt;br&gt;violated the anti-discrimination statute.  See Brownlie, 691 N.E.2d &lt;br&gt;at 962.  See also Kelley, 140 F.3d at 345 (multiplying damages by &lt;br&gt;2.25).  The statute simply requires a finding that the employer &lt;br&gt;satisfied the knowledge element of the statute. &lt;br&gt;         Although the district court did not provide a detailed &lt;br&gt;analysis supporting its finding, the judge affirmatively found that &lt;br&gt;it was appropriate to double the damage award.  This statement is &lt;br&gt;easily translated into a finding, supported by the record, that TWA &lt;br&gt;acted with knowledge or reason to know.  The evidence of &lt;br&gt;Humpherys's explanation for selecting Koster for furlough was not &lt;br&gt;credible. TWA's vice president of employee relations, Thibaudeau, &lt;br&gt;testified about TWA's policy prohibiting age discrimination, and &lt;br&gt;about how the policy was communicated to all managers.  This &lt;br&gt;evidence supports the finding that TWA acted with knowledge of its &lt;br&gt;violation of Massachusetts law. &lt;br&gt;         TWA also suggests that the district court \"may\" have &lt;br&gt;thought double damages were mandatory.  TWA refers us to the &lt;br&gt;multiple damage provision of the consumer protection law, which &lt;br&gt;courts have recognized requires more than a \"knowing violation,\" &lt;br&gt;despite the statutory language which suggests a less rigorous &lt;br&gt;standard.  See Cambridge Plating Co. v. NAPCO, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196794\"><a href=\"/opinion/196794/cambridge-plating-v-napco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, &lt;br&gt;770 (1st Cir. 1996).  First, it is obvious from the court's finding &lt;br&gt;that it only considered the doubling mandatory if TWA's conduct met &lt;br&gt;the standard of knowledge required by the statute.  Fontaine &lt;br&gt;instructs that double damages are mandatory if the knowledge &lt;br&gt;standard of the statute is met, and that triple damages are &lt;br&gt;discretionary.  See 613 N.E.2d at 322 (\"a certain recovery of at &lt;br&gt;least double damages\"). Although the language of the provision in &lt;br&gt;the consumer protection statute is similar, none of the cases under &lt;br&gt;the age discrimination statute suggest that the knowledge &lt;br&gt;requirement is higher than that suggested by the statute.  See, &lt;br&gt;e.g., Brownlie, 691 N.E.2d at 962;  cf. Cambridge Plating, 85 F.3d &lt;br&gt;at 770-771.  The court did not err in awarding double damages. &lt;br&gt;                                V. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues that the attorneys' fee award of $155,807.50 &lt;br&gt;is excessive.  Our review of the attorneys' fee award is governed &lt;br&gt;by Massachusetts Law.  Krewson v. City of Quincy, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span>, 17 &lt;br&gt;(1st Cir. 1996). &lt;br&gt;         The amount of a reasonable attorneys' fee, awarded on the &lt;br&gt;basis of statutory authority, is largely discretionary.  See &lt;br&gt;Fontaine, 613 N.E.2d at 890. &lt;br&gt;         TWA argues that the fee should be vacated because the &lt;br&gt;court abused its discretion in awarding Koster his full attorneys' &lt;br&gt;fees.  TWA contends that the case did not warrant the participation &lt;br&gt;of three attorneys, and the court should have reduced the award to &lt;br&gt;take into account that Koster lost on his breach of contract claim. &lt;br&gt;         The district court, however, determined that the fees &lt;br&gt;were reasonable.  The judge stated: &lt;br&gt;                      Very frankly, I find the hours reasonable, &lt;br&gt;           the amount of time spent.  The fact that &lt;br&gt;           there were three lawyers on one side and &lt;br&gt;           two on the other side, I don't find &lt;br&gt;           disproportionate.  It is probably fair, &lt;br&gt;           especially that you, Mr. DeGiacomo, are &lt;br&gt;           one of the most experienced and highly &lt;br&gt;           regarded trial lawyers in the city.  You &lt;br&gt;           could almost argue that it takes three &lt;br&gt;           against one, that three against one makes &lt;br&gt;           it fair. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;         TWA does not challenge the billing rate of the attorneys &lt;br&gt;nor does it suggest that the time was duplicative.  It simply &lt;br&gt;argues that \"this was not a case warranting the investment of three &lt;br&gt;attorneys.\" &lt;br&gt;         We find no abuse of discretion in allowing recovery for &lt;br&gt;the time spent by three attorneys.  TWA does not suggest the time &lt;br&gt;spent by three attorneys was duplicative, just that it was &lt;br&gt;unnecessary.  After consideration, the district court rejected this &lt;br&gt;argument.  Counsel's time spent pursuing unsuccessful claims, &lt;br&gt;however, is generally non-compensable \"unless it can be shown that &lt;br&gt;the [unsuccessful and successful] claims were interconnected.\"  &lt;br&gt;Krewson, 74 F.3d at 19.  \"Interconnection\" can be found when the &lt;br&gt;\"claims include[] a common core of facts or were based on related &lt;br&gt;legal theories.\"  Lipsett v. Blanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591130\"><a href=\"/opinion/591130/annabelle-lipsett-v-gumersindo-blanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span>, 940 (1st Cir. &lt;br&gt;1992) (quotations omitted).  Although it may be true that Koster's &lt;br&gt;breach of contract and discrimination claims arose out of the same &lt;br&gt;cluster of facts, we need not decide this question because it is &lt;br&gt;the fee target's burden to show a basis for segregability.  See id. &lt;br&gt;at 941.  TWA did not meet this burden either before the district &lt;br&gt;court or this court. &lt;br&gt;         We affirm the judgment of the district court except for &lt;br&gt;the award of damages.  We order a new trial on the issue of &lt;br&gt;emotional damages only if Koster decides not to remit $932,000 &lt;br&gt;(plus any interest accrued).&lt;/pre&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</p>\n\n</div>",
