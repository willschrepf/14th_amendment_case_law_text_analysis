U.S. Const., art. VI, § 2. The district\n\ncourt concluded, on cross-motions for summary judgment, that Rule 16-308(E) is\n\npreempted with respect to federal prosecutors practicing before grand juries, but is not\n\npreempted outside of the grand-jury context. We agree. Exercising jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                              I\n\n                                              A\n\n       The roots of Rule 16-308(E) can be traced to the adoption by the American Bar\n\nAssociation (“ABA”) of Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(e) (“Model Rule\n\n3.8(e)”). Faced with what was perceived to be an “increasing incidence of grand jury and\n\ntrial subpoenas directed toward attorneys defending criminal cases,” ABA Crim. Justice\n\nSection, Report with Recommendation to the ABA House of Delegates No. 122B, at 2\n\n(Feb. 1988), the ABA issued Model Rule 3.8(e)1 in 1990 “to limit the issuance of lawyer\n\nsubpoenas in grand jury and other criminal proceedings to those situations in which there\n\nis a genuine need to intrude into the client-lawyer relationship,” Model Rules of Prof’l\n\nConduct r. 3.8(e) cmt. 4 (Am. Bar Ass’n 2015). As adopted, Model Rule 3.8(e) stated:\n\n              The prosecutor in a criminal case shall: . . .\n\n              ([e]) not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding\n              to present evidence about a past or present client unless:\n\n                     (1)    the prosecutor reasonably believes:\n\n                            (a)     the information sought is not protected from\n                                    disclosure by an applicable privilege;\n\n                            (b)     the evidence sought is essential to the successful\n                                    completion of an ongoing investigation or\n                                    prosecution;\n\n\n\n       1\n             Originally adopted as Model Rule 3.8(f), the rule was re-designated as\nModel Rule 3.8(e) in 2002. We refer to it throughout this opinion as Model Rule 3.8(e) to\navoid any possible confusion.\n\n                                                  3\n\f                            (c)    there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the\n                                   information; and\n\n                     (2)    the prosecutor obtains prior judicial approval after an\n                            opportunity for an adversarial proceeding.\n\nABA Standing Comm. on Ethics & Prof’l Responsibility, Report with Recommendation\n\nto the ABA House of Delegates No. 118, at 1 (Feb. 1990). The rule, as originally\n\nadopted, thus consisted of two components. Subsection (e)(1) governed prosecutors’\n\nreasonable belief about the content of the information sought—i.e., that it was not\n\nprivileged, was essential, and could not be obtained from any other feasible alternative.\n\nSubsection (e)(2) imposed a judicial preapproval requirement before a prosecutor could\n\nobtain an attorney subpoena.\n\n       Several states promulgated versions of Model Rule 3.8(e), and legal challenges to\n\nthese rules produced conflicting outcomes. The Third Circuit, for example, concluded\n\nthat the judicial preapproval requirement in Pennsylvania’s version of Model Rule 3.8(e)\n\nconflicted with federal rules governing the issuance of subpoenas, and held that the\n\nenforcement of the rule against federal prosecutors was preempted. See Baylson v.\n\nDisciplinary Bd. of Supreme Court of Pa., 975 F.2d 102, 111–12 (3d Cir. 1992). In\n\ncontrast, the First Circuit found that Rhode Island’s version of the rule created “no\n\nconflict with the Supremacy Clause.” Whitehouse v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of R.I., 53\n\nF.3d 1349, 1365 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n       Before our court, the United States challenged Colorado’s adoption of Model Rule\n\n3.8(e). Specifically, we were called upon to review the district court’s dismissal of the\n\n                                             4\n\fUnited States’s action on jurisdictional grounds—that is, “[t]he district court dismissed\n\nthe complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, stating that the United States did not\n\nhave standing because it did not allege that federal prosecutors had suffered any actual or\n\nimminent injury from application of the rules.” United States v. Colo. Supreme Court\n\n(“Colorado Supreme Court I”), 87 F.3d 1161, 1163 (10th Cir. 1996). We reversed,\n\nhowever, concluding that, even though no federal prosecutor had been sanctioned under\n\nColorado’s rule, the potential that it would “interfere with federal prosecutors in their\n\nconduct of criminal proceedings and change the nature of the federal grand jury in\n\nColorado” was a sufficient injury in fact to render the case justiciable. Id. at 1165.\n\n       The case later returned to us after the district court ruled on the merits of the\n\nUnited States’s challenge. See United States v. Colo. Supreme Court (“Colorado\n\nSupreme Court II”), 189 F.3d 1281 (10th Cir. 1999). In the interim, the legal landscape\n\nhad been altered in two salient ways. First, following the ABA’s lead,2 the Colorado\n\nSupreme Court amended its Rule 3.8(e) in 1997 by removing the judicial preapproval\n\nrequirement.3 Id. at 1284. Second, in 1998, Congress stepped in and enacted the\n\n       2\n               In 1995, the ABA amended Model Rule 3.8(e) to remove the judicial\npreapproval requirement. See Stern v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Dist. of Mass., 214 F.3d 4,\n9 (1st Cir. 2000).\n       3\n             Thus, by the time of Colorado Supreme Court II, Colorado Rule\n3.8(e)—and the ABA’s Model Rule 3.8(e) on which it was based—only contained the\nreasonable-belief requirement. It provided:\n\n              The prosecutor in a criminal case shall: . . .\n\n              (e)    not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal\n\n                                              5\n\fMcDade Act, 28 U.S.C. § 530B, which requires that:\n\n              (a)    An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws\n                     and rules, and local Federal court rules, governing attorneys in\n                     each State where such attorney engages in that attorney’s duties,\n                     to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in\n                     that State.\n\n              (b)    The Attorney General shall make and amend rules of the\n                     Department of Justice to assure compliance with this section.\n\nThe Attorney General then promulgated regulations, pursuant to § 530B(b), stating that\n\nthe statute “should not be construed in any way to alter federal substantive, procedural, or\n\nevidentiary law.” 28 C.F.R. § 77.1(b).\n\n       As we framed it in Colorado Supreme Court II, the “question whether Rule 3.8\n\nviolate[d] the Supremacy Clause now turn[ed] on whether the rule [wa]s a rule of\n\nprofessional ethics clearly covered by the McDade Act, or a substantive or procedural\n\nrule that [wa]s inconsistent with federal law.” 189 F.3d at 1284. In a nutshell, the\n\nessence of the inquiry was whether Rule 3.8 was preempted by federal law. Significantly,\n\n\n\n\n                     proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client\n                     unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:\n\n                     (1)    the information sought is not protected from disclosure\n                            by any applicable privilege;\n\n                     (2)    the evidence sought is essential to the successful\n                            completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution;\n\n                     (3)    there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the\n                            information.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fwe only addressed there, however, the question of whether Colorado’s Rule 3.8 was\n\npreempted outside of the grand-jury context—viz., the “trial” context.4 In this regard, in\n\ndefining the scope of our analysis, we stated: “In its decision on remand, the district court\n\ndetermined that the restriction on grand jury proceedings violated the Supremacy Clause.\n\nDefendants have not appealed that determination and we do not address it here.” Id.\n\n       Turning to the question at hand, we observed that Colorado’s Rule 3.8, inter alia,\n\nprescribed “broad normative principles of attorney self-conduct,” and we determined that\n\n“the rule in its current incarnation is a rule of ethics applicable to federal prosecutors by\n\nthe McDade Act.” Id. at 1288–89. Nevertheless, we proceeded to determine whether this\n\nethics rule was otherwise “inconsistent with federal law” and thus preempted. Id. at\n\n1289. We concluded that it was not, and therefore it could be “enforced by the state\n\ndefendants against federal prosecutors.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n              In Colorado Supreme Court II, we briefly intimated in a footnote that the\nuniverse of attorney subpoenas implicated by rules like Colorado’s consists of “grand jury\nand trial subpoenas.” 189 F.3d at 1286 n.6; see also id. at 1284 n.3 (describing the First\nCircuit as “holding federal courts could adopt a rule requiring a federal prosecutor at\neither the grand jury or trial stage to obtain judicial approval before serving a subpoena\non counsel to compel evidence concerning a client” (emphasis added)). We did not\ndefine the term “trial subpoenas” there, and it seems likely that, similar to the First\nCircuit, we were “us[ing] the term ‘trial subpoenas’ as a shorthand for all other\nsubpoenas (e.g., subpoenas issued in the course of pretrial hearings)”—i.e., all attorney\nsubpoenas issued by federal prosecutors in criminal proceedings other than grand-jury\nsubpoenas. Stern, 214 F.3d at 18 n.5 (emphasis added). In any event, we deem this\nshorthand convention to be helpful. We note that the United States employs it, and\nDefendants do not object. Accordingly, as needed, we use it here.\n\n                                               7\n\f                                                 B\n\n       Against this backdrop, in 2008, New Mexico adopted Rule 16-308(E), which\n\nprovides that:\n\n                 A prosecutor in a criminal case shall: . . .\n\n                 E.     not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal\n                        proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client\n                        unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:\n\n                        (1)    the information sought is not protected from disclosure\n                               by any applicable privilege;\n\n                        (2)    the evidence sought is essential to the successful\n                               completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution;\n                               and\n\n                        (3)    there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the\n                               information[.] . . .\n\nN.M. Rules of Prof’l Conduct, N.M.R.A. 16-308(E). This rule is identical to the\n\nColorado rule that we reviewed in Colorado Supreme Court II. Though the U.S. District\n\nCourt for the District of New Mexico has generally adopted the New Mexico Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct, see D.N.M.LR-Cr. 57.2, it has chosen not to adopt Rule 16-308(E),\n\nsee D.N.M. Admin. Order No. 10-MC-00004-9 (Mar. 23, 2010). Nonetheless, the rule\n\ncontinues to apply to the conduct of federal prosecutors licensed to practice in New\n\nMexico, and a violation of the rule can form the basis for disciplinary sanctions. See\n\nN.M. Rules Governing Discipline, N.M.R.A. 17-205.\n\n       The United States filed suit against Defendants in April 2013, arguing that the\n\nsecond and third requirements of Rule 16-308(E)—i.e., the essentiality and no-other-\n\n                                                 8\n\ffeasible-alternative conditions—were preempted by federal law. From the outset, these\n\ntwo provisions have been the only ones at issue in this litigation.5 Defendants moved to\n\ndismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the United\n\nStates lacked standing and that the case was not ripe in the absence of an actual or\n\nthreatened disciplinary action against a federal prosecutor. The district court rejected this\n\nargument and denied the motion. Relying in large part on our decision in Colorado\n\nSupreme Court I, it concluded that the complaint sufficiently alleged an injury in fact, to\n\nthe extent that Rule 16-308(E) altered federal prosecutors’ attorney-subpoena practice. It\n\nalso determined that the case was ripe because “the preemption issue is purely a question\n\nof law.” Aplts.’ App. at 152 (Mem. Op. & Order Den. Mot. to Dismiss, filed Nov. 1,\n\n2013).\n\n         The United States moved for summary judgment in June 2013, before the parties\n\nhad engaged in any discovery. Attached to its summary-judgment motion, the United\n\nStates submitted the affidavit of an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of New\n\nMexico. The declaration described several instances in which prosecutors in the U.S.\n\nAttorney’s Office (“USAO”) had issued attorney subpoenas prior to the enactment of\n\n\n         5\n               It is undisputed that the United States does not challenge the first provision\nof Rule 16-308(E)—viz., subsection (E)(1)’s directive that a federal prosecutor must have\na reasonable belief that the information sought from an attorney is not protected from\ndisclosure by a privilege. In other words, this subsection is not at issue here. Throughout\nthis opinion, for convenience, we frequently refer in general terms to the United States’s\nchallenge to New Mexico’s Rule 16-308(E), without segregating out the two provisions\nof the rule that are actually at issue. Nonetheless, we underscore that a challenge to\nsubsection (E)(1) is not before us.\n\n                                              9\n\fRule 16-308(E); it suggested that, even though “[t]his evidence was obtained in a lawful\n\nmanner [and] implicated no privilege,” had Rule 16-308(E) been in effect, “it is unlikely\n\nthe prosecutor would have served the subpoena[s].” Id. at 80–81 (Decl. of Sasha Siemel,\n\nfiled June 28, 2013).\n\n       Addressing the rule’s current effect on the USAO’s work, the declarant noted that\n\n“Rule 11-308(E) has a ‘chilling’ effect on prosecutors.” Id. at 83. After averring that\n\nthere are “many examples of such situations,” the declaration discussed, in general\n\nterms—with the aim of preserving grand-jury secrecy—several specific instances in\n\nwhich prosecutors “have already actually [been] hampered . . . in the performance of their\n\notherwise lawful duties” by concerns that they would be disciplined for violating the\n\nessentiality or no-other-feasible-alternative conditions of Rule 16-308(E). Id. at 84. The\n\ndeclaration further provided:\n\n                These situations demonstrate that well-meaning prosecutors using legal\n                means of obtaining evidence of criminality are subject to discipline\n                simply for performing their duties. Federal grand juries in the District\n                of New Mexico will continue in the future to need evidence of crimes\n                from lawyers. In many such cases, the most appropriate means of\n                obtaining that evidence will be by subpoena. . . . If enforced against\n                federal prosecutors, Rule 16-308(E) will interfere directly with efforts\n                of this Office and the Department of Justice to enforce the criminal\n                laws of the United States.\n\nId. at 88–89.\n\n       Defendants filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d),\n\nasking the court to delay ruling on the United States’s summary-judgment motion\n\npending the completion of discovery. In the alternative, they moved for summary\n\n                                               10\n\fjudgment on the existing record, claiming that Rule 16-308(E) was a permissible ethics\n\nrule under the McDade Act and our opinion in Colorado Supreme Court II. The district\n\ncourt denied Defendants’ Rule 56(d) motion, concluding that further factual development\n\nwas unnecessary to decide the “purely legal question” of “whether or not Rule 16-308(E)\n\nis an ethical rule or a substantive rule.” Id. at 261 (Order Den. Defs.’ 56(d) Request for\n\nExtension of Time, filed Nov. 27, 2013).\n\n       After further briefing and argument, the court granted partial summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the United States and partial summary judgment in favor of Defendants.\n\nSpecifically, it determined that our decision in Colorado Supreme Court II compelled the\n\nconclusion that Rule 16-308(E) was not preempted by federal law as to criminal\n\nproceedings outside of the grand-jury context. However, it determined that the rule\n\nconflicted with “three strong governmental interests in grand jury proceedings of ‘[(1)]\n\naffording grand juries wide latitude, [(2)] avoiding minitrials on peripheral matters, and\n\n[(3)] preserving a necessary level of secrecy.’” Id. at 321 (Mem. Op. & Order, filed Feb.\n\n3, 2014) (alterations in original) (quoting United States v. R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 292,\n\n300 (1991)). In particular, the court noted that the rule imposed “a higher burden on\n\nfederal prosecutors that is simply not warranted at the grand jury stage” and threatened\n\ngrand-jury secrecy by forcing prosecutors to disclose details of confidential investigations\n\nin order to avoid disciplinary sanctions. Id. at 322.\n\n       The district court thus upheld the application of Rule 16-308(E) to federal\n\nprosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas for criminal proceedings outside of the\n\n                                             11\n\fgrand-jury context, but enjoined Defendants from “instituting, prosecuting, or continuing\n\nany disciplinary proceeding or action against any federal prosecutor for otherwise lawful\n\nactions taken in the course of a grand jury investigation or proceeding on the ground that\n\nsuch attorneys violated Rule 16-308(E) of the New Mexico Rules of Professional\n\nConduct.” Id. at 326–27 (Final J., filed Feb. 3, 2014).\n\n                                               II\n\n       Both parties appeal from the district court’s judgment. Defendants challenge the\n\ndistrict court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, its denial of their request for further discovery,\n\nits holding that Rule 16-308(E) conflicts with federal law governing grand juries, and the\n\nscope of the injunction that the court issued. The United States challenges the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Rule 16-308(E) is not preempted outside of the grand-jury\n\ncontext. The United States’s appellate challenge, however, is primarily form, not\n\nsubstance. Though it seeks to “preserve [the preemption issue] for possible further\n\nreview,” Aplee.’s/Cross-Aplt.’s Reply Br. (“U.S. Reply Br.”) at 12, the United States\n\nacknowledges the precedential force of Colorado Supreme Court II and thus concedes\n\nthat Rule 16-308(E) is not preempted by federal law outside of the grand-jury context.\n\nConsequently, we resolve the United States’s appeal in summary fashion below. The\n\nheart of the parties’ dispute relates to whether Rule 16-308(E) is preempted relative to\n\nfederal prosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas in the grand-jury context.\n\nConsequently, our analysis naturally focuses extensively on this issue. However, before\n\nreaching the merits of this question, we must address Defendants’ threshold contentions\n\n                                               12\n\fregarding subject-matter jurisdiction and the district court’s refusal to allow them further\n\ndiscovery.\n\n                                               A\n\n       Defendants claim that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over this\n\ndispute because the United States does not have standing and because the case is not ripe\n\nfor review. We review questions of justiciability—including standing and ripeness—de\n\nnovo. See Kan. Judicial Review v. Stout, 519 F.3d 1107, 1114 (10th Cir. 2008); accord\n\nRoe No. 2 v. Ogden, 253 F.3d 1225, 1228, 1231 (10th Cir. 2001). We determine\n\nultimately that there is an adequate legal basis for subject-matter jurisdiction here.\n\n                                                1\n\n       Standing, as “a component of the case-or-controversy requirement [of Article III],\n\nserves to ensure that the plaintiff is ‘a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the\n\ndispute.’” Habecker v. Town of Estes Park, 518 F.3d 1217, 1223 (10th Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)). In order to demonstrate standing, a\n\nplaintiff must show: “(1) that he or she has ‘suffered an injury in fact,’ (2) that the injury\n\nis ‘fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,’ and, (3) that it is ‘likely’\n\nthat ‘the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.’” Cressman v. Thompson, 719\n\nF.3d 1139, 1144 (10th Cir. 2013) (quoting Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1120 (10th Cir.\n\n2012)).\n\n       Defendants challenge the adequacy of the United States’s allegations of injury at\n\nboth the pleading and summary-judgment stages. They also claim that any harm that the\n\n                                               13\n\fUnited States suffered was self-inflicted—notably, based on a speculative fear of\n\ndisciplinary sanctions—and is thus insufficient to establish an injury in fact. We reject\n\nthese arguments, concluding that the United States has standing to bring this lawsuit in\n\nfederal court.\n\n                                             a\n\n       “When evaluating a plaintiff’s standing at [the motion to dismiss] stage, both the\n\ntrial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,\n\nand must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.” Cressman, 719 F.3d\n\nat 1144 (alteration in original) (quoting Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d\n\n1082, 1089 (10th Cir. 2006) (en banc)); accord S. Utah Wilderness All. v. Palma, 707\n\nF.3d 1143, 1152 (10th Cir. 2013). While the burden of establishing standing at this stage\n\nof the litigation “is lightened considerably,” Petrella v. Brownback, 697 F.3d 1285, 1292\n\n(10th Cir. 2012), “[t]he injury alleged must be ‘concrete and particularized,’” id. at 1293\n\n(quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009)).\n\n       The complaint here alleges that (1) Rule 16-308(E) imposes higher substantive\n\nstandards for grand-jury and trial subpoenas than those established by federal law; (2)\n\napproximately seventy federal prosecutors in the District of New Mexico are licensed in\n\nNew Mexico, and are thus subject to discipline under the New Mexico Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct; (3) these federal prosecutors have “changed their practices in\n\ncriminal investigations” and have been deterred from issuing attorney subpoenas for fear\n\nof disciplinary proceedings under Rule 16-308(E), Aplts.’ App. at 13 (Compl., filed Apr.\n\n                                             14\n\f30, 2013); and (4) as a result, the information available to grand juries and courts in the\n\nDistrict of New Mexico has been limited—impairing the United States’s interest in the\n\n“effective conduct of federal criminal investigations and prosecutions,” id. at 18.\n\n       In Colorado Supreme Court I, we concluded that an alleged injury of a similar\n\nnature—viz., the “delays [in] the presentation of evidence to grand juries” due to the\n\nenforcement of a state attorney-subpoena rule—established a “concrete, particularized,\n\nand actual injury in fact.” 87 F.3d at 1165; see id. (“These allegations are sufficient to\n\nwithstand a motion to dismiss.”). Defendants seek to distinguish that decision because\n\nthe Colorado rule at issue involved a judicial preapproval requirement; such a distinction,\n\nhowever, is not persuasive. We specifically addressed the essentiality and no-other-\n\nfeasible-alternative conditions—which appear verbatim in New Mexico’s Rule 16-\n\n308(E)—and concluded that these “require[d] far more from federal prosecutors” and “set\n\na higher standard for obtaining attorney subpoenas” than is required by federal law or\n\ninternal agency guidelines. Id. at 1166. In other words, we held that these two conditions\n\nimposed sufficiently concrete and particularized injuries on the United States to give it\n\nstanding.\n\n       Thus, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the United States’s specific averments—i.e,\n\nindicating that Rule 16-308(E) has deterred federal prosecutors from issuing otherwise-\n\npermissible attorney subpoenas, thereby limiting the presentation of relevant evidence in\n\ngrand-jury and other criminal proceedings—“sufficiently allege[ ] the injury in fact\n\nrequired for standing.” Id. at 1167.\n\n                                             15\n\f                                              b\n\n       At the summary-judgment stage, mere allegations no longer suffice; instead “the\n\nelements of standing must be set forth, through specific facts, by affidavit or other\n\nevidence.” Tandy v. City of Wichita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1284 (10th Cir. 2004); accord\n\nProtocols, LLC v. Leavitt, 549 F.3d 1294, 1298 (10th Cir. 2008). Defendants claim that\n\nthe declaration submitted with the United States’s motion for summary judgment lacks\n\nthe requisite specificity because it “does not tie any alleged past injury to the application\n\nof the challenged rule” and “does not identify any particular subpoena that is presently at\n\nissue.” Aplts.’/Cross-Aplees.’ Principal Br. (“Aplts.’ Opening Br.”) at 34.\n\n       Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, the summary-judgment declaration contains\n\nseveral factual statements demonstrating how Rule 16-308(E) has worked to the\n\ndetriment of federal prosecutors. In particular, after generally averring that there are\n\n“many examples of such situations,” the declaration specifically describes several\n\ninstances in which prosecutors “have already actually [been] hampered . . . in the\n\nperformance of their otherwise lawful duties” by concerns that they would be disciplined\n\nfor violating the essentiality or no-other-feasible-alternative conditions of Rule 16-\n\n308(E). Aplts.’ App. at 84. For example, the declaration offered the following:\n\n              The [USAO] investigated an investment fraud scheme perpetrated by\n              a target who, upon learning that he was under investigation, hired a\n              criminal defense attorney. The target used money generated by the\n              scheme to pay for his criminal defense, but he told a witness he had\n              used the money to pay the attorney for legal work related to the\n              supposed investment. Only the target and the attorney were in a\n              position to testify that the victim funds were used for his criminal\n\n                                                  16\n\f              defense and not for any actual investment-related purposes. The threat\n              of ethical sanctions posed by Rule l 6-308(E) prevented the prosecutor\n              from seeking this important evidence from the attorney. Consequently,\n              had the subpoena been issued, the prosecutor would have risked being\n              accused of seeking evidence that might later have been deemed\n              obtainable by alternative means or not ‘essential’ under Rule\n              16-308(E).\n\nId. at 84–85. This and the other examples offered in the declaration illustrate the United\n\nStates’s alleged injury with adequate particularity.\n\n       Furthermore, prosecutors’ efforts to avoid sanctions, and the resulting reduction in\n\navailable evidence in grand-jury and other criminal proceedings, demonstrate sufficient\n\ninjuries to establish federal-court jurisdiction. See Cressman, 719 F.3d at 1145\n\n(concluding that costs “incur[red] to avoid prosecution” could confer standing on the\n\nplaintiff); Colorado Supreme Court I, 87 F.3d at 1167 (“[E]fforts to avoid litigation do\n\nnot cast doubt on standing . . . .”); cf. Stern v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Dist. of Mass., 214\n\nF.3d 4, 11–12 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Colorado Supreme Court I in addressing ripeness,\n\nand noting that “[t]he threat of ethics enforcement is genuine, compliance costs are real\n\nand immediate, and the chilling effect on attorney subpoena requests constitutes an injury\n\nsufficient to support a justiciable controversy”). Moreover, the declaration discusses a\n\ncase in which counsel for a criminal defendant sought to quash an attorney subpoena on\n\nthe basis that the prosecutor had obtained it in violation of Rule 16-308(E). Although this\n\nattempt to quash the subpoena failed, the declarant avers that the defense lawyer could\n\nhave also filed an ethics complaint against the prosecutor. See generally N.M. Rules\n\nGoverning Discipline, N.M.R.A. 17-102(A) (stating that the Disciplinary Board may\n\n                                              17\n\finitiate an investigation “upon complaint by any person”).\n\n       In sum, we are satisfied that, at the summary-judgment phase, the United States\n\nadequately demonstrated standing.6\n\n                                             c\n\n       However, Defendants maintain that, in the absence of any actual or threatened\n\nenforcement action based on a particular subpoena, federal prosecutors have\n\nimpermissibly attempted to “manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on\n\nthemselves” by voluntarily declining to issue certain attorney subpoenas. Aplts.’\n\nOpening Br. at 28 (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, --- U.S. ----, 133 S. Ct. 1138,\n\n1151 (2013)).\n\n                                              i\n\n       We do not require “a plaintiff [to] risk actual prosecution before challenging an\n\nallegedly unconstitutional . . . statute.” Bronson v. Swensen, 500 F.3d 1099, 1107 (10th\n\nCir. 2007). “Standing may still exist even when a plaintiff ends the proscribed behavior,\n\nso long as a credible threat remains that such behavior, if taken in the future, would be\n\n\n\n       6\n               Defendants also claim that they were impermissibly “forced to accept\nPlaintiff’s standing based on . . . Plaintiff’s ‘self-description’ of federal prosecutors’\nactivities in New Mexico.” Aplts.’ Opening Br. at 35 (quoting Summers, 555 U.S. at\n497). However, for purposes of resolving Defendants’ cross-motion for summary\njudgment on the standing issue, the district court appropriately took the position that the\nnonmovant United States’s particularized facts set forth in an affidavit or declaration\n“will be taken to be true.” Colo. Cross-Disability Coal. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co., 765\nF.3d 1205, 1211 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n561 (1992)).\n\n                                             18\n\fprosecuted.” Id. at 1108; see also D.L.S. v. Utah, 374 F.3d 971, 975 (10th Cir. 2004)\n\n(requiring an “objectively justified fear of real consequences, which can be satisfied by\n\nshowing a credible threat of prosecution or other consequences following from the\n\nstatute’s enforcement”).\n\n       The threat of prosecution is generally credible where a challenged “provision on its\n\nface proscribes” the conduct in which a plaintiff wishes to engage, and the state “has not\n\ndisavowed any intention of invoking the . . . provision” against the plaintiff. Babbitt v.\n\nUnited Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 302 (1979); see, e.g., Holder v.\n\nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 16 (2010) (concluding that plaintiffs had alleged\n\na credible threat of prosecution where the “Government has not argued . . . that plaintiffs\n\nwill not be prosecuted if they do what they say they wish to do”); Cressman, 719 F.3d at\n\n1145 (holding that the threat of prosecution was credible where state officials had\n\ninformed the plaintiff that he could be prosecuted for disobeying the challenged statute);\n\ncf. Stern, 214 F.3d at 10 (concluding that the U.S. Attorney’s suit was ripe where the rule\n\nimposed new substantive and procedural requirements on federal prosecutors and “Bar\n\nCounsel ha[d] stated unequivocally that he w[ould] enforce those requirements”).\n\n       Here, federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico are bound by the entirety of the\n\nNew Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct, including the challenged provisions of Rule\n\n16-308(E), and may be disciplined for violating those rules. See N.M. Rules Governing\n\nDiscipline, N.M.R.A. 17-205. Rule 16-308(E) explicitly proscribes the types of attorney\n\nsubpoenas federal prosecutors under certain circumstances may want to issue—namely,\n\n                                             19\n\fthose that are not “essential” to an investigation and for which a feasible alternative might\n\nexist. And the federal prosecutor’s declaration submitted by the United States provides\n\nconcrete evidence of ongoing desire and need of prosecutors in carrying out their lawful\n\nduties to issue such subpoenas. Cf. Colo. Outfitters Ass’n v. Hickenlooper, --- F.3d ----,\n\n2016 WL 1105363, at *7 (10th Cir. Mar. 22, 2016) (concluding that certain organizations\n\nhad not established standing “[a]bsent any testimony indicating . . . [they] intended to\n\nengage in conduct that might violate” the statute at issue). Notably, Defendants have not\n\nindicated that the federal prosecutors will not be subject to discipline for disobeying Rule\n\n16-308(E). Thus, even in the absence of any actual enforcement action, Rule 16-308(E)\n\ncreates a sufficiently credible threat of prosecution to confer standing upon the United\n\nStates.\n\n                                              ii\n\n          Defendants base their self-inflicted-injury argument on Clapper v. Amnesty\n\nInternational USA; however, their reliance on this case is misguided. There, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that precautions taken by the plaintiffs to avoid the interception of their\n\ncommunications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 were self-\n\ninflicted, and did not establish standing, because the statute did “not regulate, constrain,\n\nor compel any action on [the plaintiffs’] part.” Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1153. The Court\n\nemphasized that any injury to the plaintiffs rested on a “highly attenuated chain of\n\npossibilities”—viz., that the government would (1) target specific individuals that the\n\nplaintiffs communicated with; (2) invoke its authority under the statutory provision at\n\n                                              20\n\fissue; (3) obtain authorization for the interception from a judge; and (4) actually intercept\n\ncommunications involving the plaintiffs. Id. at 1148.\n\n       However, in reviewing its standing jurisprudence, the Court recognized that, in\n\ncontrast, “reasonable efforts [taken] to avoid greater injuries” could be sufficient for\n\nstanding if the plaintiffs “would be subject to [discipline] but for their decision to take\n\npreventative measures.” Id. at 1153 (emphasis added) (discussing Monsanto Co. v.\n\nGeerston Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139 (2010), Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.\n\nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167 (2000), and Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465 (1987)). This\n\nscenario—where standing could be found—which Clapper used to distinguish the\n\ncircumstances before it, is actually akin to the scenario of the present case. Thus, far\n\nfrom aiding Defendants, Clapper reinforces the view that where federal prosecutors\n\nlicensed in New Mexico take precautions that significantly hinder them from carrying out\n\ntheir lawful responsibilities to investigate and prosecute crimes, in order to avoid possible\n\ndisciplinary investigations and sanctions from state ethics officials, then the United States\n\nhas suffered a cognizable injury for standing purposes.\n\n       Lastly, in placing another spin on their self-inflicted injury argument against\n\nstanding, Defendants draw our attention to the fact that federal attorneys can practice\n\nbefore the District Court for the District of New Mexico without being licensed in New\n\nMexico. In other words, they point out that the United States Attorney could hire only\n\nattorneys without New Mexico law licenses as prosecutors in the District of New Mexico\n\noffice, or those seeking to be federal prosecutors in that office could forego a New\n\n                                              21\n\fMexico law licenses in favor of bar membership in another, less restrictive jurisdiction.\n\nIn view of these alternatives, Defendants argue that the individual choices of federal\n\nprosecutors or would-be federal prosecutors to hold New Mexico law licenses—and thus\n\nsubject themselves to Rule 16-308(E)—amounts to a self-inflicted injury, and not a harm\n\noccasioned by, or fairly traceable to, Defendants’ conduct relative to Rule 16-308(E).\n\n       Defendants’ position, however, is unconvincing because it is an injury in itself to\n\navoid lawful conduct—viz., obtaining a New Mexico law license—in order to avoid the\n\napplication of an allegedly unlawful Rule. See Meese, 481 U.S. at 475 (explaining that\n\n“the need to take . . . affirmative steps to avoid the risk of harm . . . constitutes a\n\ncognizable injury”); Dias v. City & Cty. of Denver, 567 F.3d 1169, 1177 (10th Cir. 2009)\n\n(concluding that the plaintiffs “suffered actual injuries because they were forced to move\n\nfrom Denver to avoid the reach of the [arguably unlawful] Ordinance”). Accordingly, we\n\nreject this iteration of Defendants’ self-inflicted injury argument.\n\n                                               iii\n\n       Twenty years ago, we stated that “federal prosecutors need not risk disbarment by\n\nviolating the Colorado Rules in order to challenge those rules in federal court.” Colorado\n\nSupreme Court I, 87 F.3d at 1167. Defendants do not persuade us that we should adopt a\n\ndifferent position with respect to New Mexico Rule 16-308(E). At both the pleadings and\n\nsummary-judgment stages of this litigation, the United States has adequately articulated\n\nits alleged injury. That injury—e.g., the issuance of fewer attorney subpoenas, resulting\n\nin a reduction in otherwise available evidence for law enforcement purposes—is not\n\n                                               22\n\fbased on an attenuated alignment of a variety of events. Rather, it stems from, and is\n\ntraceable to, the higher and conflicting standards imposed by Rule 16-308(E), which\n\nrestrict federal prosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas. And the relevant state\n\nauthorities have not disavowed an intention to sanction federal prosecutors who run afoul\n\nof these standards. In other words, the United States plainly faces a cognizable injury,\n\ntraceable to Rule 16-308(E),7 and we conclude that it has standing to challenge Rule 16-\n\n308(E).\n\n                                              2\n\n       The “[r]ipeness doctrine addresses a timing question: when in time is it appropriate\n\nfor a court to take up the asserted claim.” Kan. Judicial Review, 519 F.3d at 1116\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting ACORN v. City of Tulsa, 835 F.2d 735, 738 (10th Cir.\n\n1987)). “Ripeness reflects constitutional considerations that implicate Article III\n\nlimitations on judicial power, as well as prudential reasons for refusing to exercise\n\njurisdiction.” Awad, 670 F.3d at 1124 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l\n\nCorp., 559 U.S. 662, 670 n.2 (2010)). The requirements of standing and constitutional\n\nripeness overlap; if an injury “is sufficiently ‘imminent’ to establish standing, the\n\nconstitutional requirements of the ripeness doctrine will necessarily be satisfied.” Id.\n\n(quoting ACLU v. Johnson, 194 F.3d 1149, 1155 (10th Cir. 1999)); see also Susan B.\n\n\n\n       7\n       On this point, Defendants again argue that Clapper governs this analysis, and\nsquarely defeats the United States’s claim of Article III standing. Nevertheless, we find\nDefendants’ reliance upon Clapper misplaced for the reasons set forth supra.\n\n                                             23\n\fAnthony List v. Driehaus, --- U.S.----, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 n.5 (2014). The prudential\n\nrequirements, however, turn on “both the ‘fitness of the issues for judicial decision’ and\n\nthe ‘hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’” Ohio Forestry Ass’n,\n\nInc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998) (quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S.\n\n136, 149 (1967), overruled on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977));\n\naccord United States v. Vaquera-Juanes, 638 F.3d 734, 737 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n       Defendants invoke prudential considerations, challenging only the fitness of the\n\npreemption claim for judicial review. They argue that, in the absence of a pending state\n\nenforcement action, the United States’s complaint rests on “an abundance of uncertain or\n\ncontingent future events,” including the issuance of a subpoena that violates Rule 16-\n\n308(E) and the filing of a disciplinary complaint against the issuing prosecutor. Aplts.’\n\nOpening Br. at 31–32. Yet these contingencies would only be relevant if waiting for\n\nthem to play out would “significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues\n\npresented [ ]or aid us in their resolution.” Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Grp.,\n\nInc., 438 U.S. 59, 82 (1978); accord Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S.\n\n803, 812 (2003). But waiting would not have this effect.\n\n       While Defendants assert that the preemption claim remains “too abstract and\n\ntheoretical” in the absence of a specific investigation, Aplts.’ Opening Br. at 33, in\n\nreality, the claim turns on whether Rule 16-308(E) is an ethics rule permitted by the\n\nMcDade Act and, if so, whether it nonetheless conflicts with federal law governing\n\nprosecutors’ subpoena practices before federal grand juries and federal district courts.\n\n                                             24\n\fThese questions are matters of law that can be resolved without further factual\n\ndevelopment. See Colorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284 (noting that “this\n\nappeal . . . presents purely legal questions”); accord Stern, 214 F.3d at 10 (“The issue\n\npresented can be finally resolved by declaratory judgment, its contours are sharply\n\ndefined, and additional facts will not affect its resolution.”); see also Awad, 670 F.3d at\n\n1124 (“[O]n fitness, we ‘focus[ ] on whether determination of the merits turns upon\n\nstrictly legal issues or requires facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.’” (second\n\nalteration in original) (quoting Stout, 519 F.3d at 1118)).\n\n       Indeed, several courts—including our own—have resolved challenges to similar\n\nstate attorney-subpoena rules in the absence of specific applications, suggesting that the\n\nUnited States’s claim here is fit for judicial resolution. See Stern, 214 F.3d at 9;\n\nColorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284; Whitehouse, 53 F.3d at 1353–54; Baylson,\n\n975 F.2d at 105. Thus, because the question presented in this appeal—viz., whether the\n\nchallenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) are preempted by federal law—would not be\n\n“better grasped when viewed in light of a particular application,” Texas v. United States,\n\n523 U.S. 296, 301 (1998), we consider it ripe for judicial review.\n\n                                              B\n\n       Having determined that the district court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over this\n\ncase was sound, we turn now to Defendants’ claim that the court committed reversible\n\nerror by denying their Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) motion to stay its ruling on\n\nsummary judgment pending the completion of discovery.\n\n                                              25\n\f       We review the denial of a Rule 56(d) motion for an abuse of discretion—a\n\nstandard that “implies a degree of ‘[d]iscretion invested in judges [to render] a decision\n\nbased upon what is fair in the circumstances and guided by the rules and principles of\n\nlaw.’” Valley Forge Ins. Co. v. Health Care Mgmt. Partners, Ltd., 616 F.3d 1086, 1096\n\n(10th Cir. 2010) (alterations in original) (quoting In re Bueno, 248 B.R. 581, 582 (Bankr.\n\nD. Colo. 2000)). As such, even though the general rule is that summary judgment should\n\nnot be entered “where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover\n\ninformation that is essential to his opposition,” Price ex. rel. Price v. W. Res., Inc., 232\n\nF.3d 779, 783 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n\n250 n.5 (1986)), we will not reverse a ruling denying discovery unless it “exceed[s] the\n\nbounds of the rationally available choices given the facts and the applicable law in the\n\ncase at hand,” FDIC v. Arciero, 741 F.3d 1111, 1116 (10th Cir. 2013) (quoting Valley\n\nForge Ins. Co., 616 F.3d at 1096).\n\n       Here, the district court denied the Rule 56(d) motion because it concluded that the\n\ncase would turn on “whether or not Rule 16-308(E) is an ethical rule or a substantive\n\nrule,” such that “the wording of the rule itself, not factual circumstances surrounding the\n\nenactment or enforcement of the rule” would be determinative. Aplts.’ App. at 261. This\n\nobservation is consistent with our prior conclusion that the issue of whether federal law\n\npreempts a state attorney-subpoena rule “presents purely legal questions.” Colorado\n\nSupreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284; see also Stern, 214 F.3d at 10 (concluding that the\n\nissue of an attorney-subpoena rule’s validity was “sharply defined, and additional facts\n\n                                              26\n\fw[ould] not affect its resolution”).8 Indeed, much of the district court’s order is devoted\n\nto discussing relevant decisions from other circuits addressing preemption claims\n\ninvolving similar state attorney-subpoena rules, and ultimately “[w]ith the guidance of\n\nthe . . . cited precedent, the [c]ourt f[ound] that Rule 16-308(E), as applied to grand jury\n\nproceedings, violate[d] the Supremacy Clause.” Aplts.’ App. at 322.\n\n       The facts as to which Defendants sought discovery—including whether Rule 16-\n\n308(E) actually causes delay and whether there have been any disciplinary\n\n\n\n       8\n               Defendants place much stock in the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Greater\nBalt. Ctr. for Pregnancy Concerns, Inc. v. Mayor & City Council of Balt., 721 F.3d 264\n(4th Cir. 2013) (en banc). That case—which is from another circuit—is of course not\nbinding on us. Moreover, its holding appears to be rooted in the Fourth Circuit’s\nunderstanding of the unique requirements of First Amendment claims. Specifically, the\nFourth Circuit reversed there a district court’s determination that discovery was not\nnecessary to resolve as-applied and facial First Amendment claims: as the court saw it,\n“[i]n the First Amendment context,” it was necessary for the city defendant to have\ninformation about how the challenged ordinance affected the plaintiff pregnancy center in\norder to defend an as-applied challenge, and, in order to make its case to the district court\nas to the facial attack, the city needed information “concerning the distinctive\ncharacteristics of Baltimore’s various limited-service pregnancy centers.” 721 F.3d at\n282. In contrast, in a preemption case like this one, the inquiry is almost entirely a legal\none. See, e.g., Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm’n,\n461 U.S. 190, 201 (1983) (“The question of preemption is predominantly legal . . . .”);\nH & R Block E. Enters. v. Raskin, 591 F.3d 718, 723 (4th Cir. 2010) (describing the\nconflict-preemption analysis as “a two-step process of first ascertaining the construction\nof the two statutes and then determining the constitutional question [of] whether they are\nin conflict” (alteration in original) (quoting Chi. & N.W. Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile\nCo., 450 U.S. 311, 317 (1981))); see also Sec. Indus. Ass’n v. Connolly, 883 F.2d 1114,\n1125 n.10 (1st Cir. 1989) (concluding that a Rule 56(d) motion seeking to delay summary\njudgment in order to assess the impact of a challenged regulation on investors and brokers\nwas “beside the point” because it was not directed at the determinative legal question of\nwhether the regulation was preempted). Accordingly, we believe Defendants’ reliance on\nGreater Baltimore Center for Pregnancy Concerns is misplaced.\n\n                                             27\n\fproceedings—were not “essential to [their] opposition.” Price, 232 F.3d at 783\n\n(emphasis added). These facts, even if established, would not have affected the district\n\ncourt’s central legal conclusion—notably, that Rule 16-308(E) creates a higher and\n\nconflicting standard for attorney subpoenas in the federal grand-jury context, and thus\n\nimpermissibly limits the types of subpoenas prosecutors may issue. As such, the court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying Defendants’ Rule 56(d) motion. See CenTra, Inc.\n\nv. Estrin, 538 F.3d 402, 420 (6th Cir. 2008) (“[W]e have affirmed the denial of Rule\n\n56[(d)] motions . . . if ‘further discovery would not have changed the legal and factual\n\ndeficiencies.’” (quoting Maki v. Laakko, 88 F.3d 361, 367 (6th Cir. 1996))).\n\n                                             C\n\n       Turning to the central dispute in this case, the United States argues that Rule 16-\n\n308(E)—more specifically, subsections (E)(2) and (E)(3), the essentiality and no-other-\n\nfeasible-alternative requirements—are preempted under the Supremacy Clause of the\n\nU.S. Constitution with respect to federal prosecutors’ subpoena practices before grand\n\njuries and in other criminal proceedings. See U.S. Const., art. VI, § 2 (“This Constitution,\n\nand the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be\n\nthe supreme Law of the Land . . . .”). Conversely, Defendants argue that the rule is not\n\npreempted in either context.9 The district court granted partial summary judgment to the\n\n\n       9\n              After oral argument, Defendants submitted a letter, pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 28(j), notifying this court of the Supreme Court’s recent decision\nin Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., --- U.S. ----, 135 S. Ct. 1378 (2015), which\nDefendants argue bars at the threshold the United States’s preemption claim. We\n\n                                             28\n\fUnited States, finding that the rule was preempted when applied to federal prosecutors’\n\nsubpoena practice before grand juries because it conflicted with certain governmental\n\ninterests—e.g., preserving grand-jury secrecy and affording grand juries wide latitude to\n\ninvestigate. However, outside of the realm of grand juries, the district court concluded\n\nthat it was bound by Colorado Supreme Court II, in which we held that an identical\n\nColorado ethics rule was not preempted by federal law governing prosecutors practicing\n\nin other criminal proceedings before federal district courts.\n\n       “We review the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment de novo,\n\napplying the same legal standards as the district court.” Qwest Corp. v. AT & T Corp.,\n\n\n\ndisagree. The Court in Armstrong held that there is no private right of action under the\nSupremacy Clause. 135 S. Ct. at 1384. The Court held that, in enacting the Medicaid\nstatute at issue, Congress intended to foreclose such private equitable relief by creating\nbroad “judicially unadministrable” standards and explicitly providing a nonjudicial means\nof enforcement—i.e., the withholding of Medicaid funds. Id. at 1385. However, in\ncontrast, nothing in the structure or terms of the McDade Act similarly suggests that\nCongress sought to override the federal courts’ equitable authority to entertain the United\nStates’s suit for injunctive relief on preemption grounds. Specifically, the McDade Act’s\ndirective is relatively straightforward—attorneys for the federal government are subject to\na state’s ethics rules to the same extent as attorneys licensed in those states—and the\nstatute provides no alternative means of enforcement. Furthermore, the Armstrong Court\nemphasized that allowing private enforcement of the Supremacy Clause would “mak[e] it\nimpossible to leave the enforcement of federal law to federal actors.” Id. at 1384. This, it\nnoted, would be inconsistent with the “discretion” the Constitution affords Congress\n“over the manner of implementing its enumerated powers.” Id. at 1383–84. To the extent\nthat Armstrong’s Supremacy Clause holding is motivated by the desire to preserve the\nfederal government’s “ability to guide the implementation of federal law,” id. at 1384,\nthis counsels in favor of—not against—permitting the United States to invoke preemption\nin order to protect its interest in the use of attorney subpoenas in federal prosecutions.\nSee Wyandotte Transp. Co. v. United States, 389 U.S. 191, 201 (1967) (noting “the\ngeneral rule that the United States may sue to protect its interests”). Thus, in our view,\nDefendants’ reliance on Armstrong is misguided.\n\n                                             29\n\f479 F.3d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir. 2007). “Where, as here, we are presented with\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, we ‘must view each motion separately,’ in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in that party’s\n\nfavor.” Manganella v.

Sudduth, 608 F.2d 431, 433 (10th Cir. 1979))).\n\n                                              1\n\n       We begin by inquiring into the nature of the United States’s “claim and the relief\n\nthat would follow.” John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 194 (2010); see Milavetz,\n\nGallop & Milavetz, P.A. v.

Carel, 668 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir. 2011). This subject is an important one,\n\nand the parties’ arguments evince considerable uncertainty and disagreement regarding it.\n\n       In Carel, we succinctly described the two relevant analytical constructs:\n\n                       An appellant may challenge the constitutionality of a statute by\n              asserting a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both. “A facial\n              challenge is a head-on attack [on a] legislative judgment, an assertion\n              that the challenged statute violates the Constitution in all, or virtually\n              all, of its applications.” United States v. Pruitt, 502 F.3d 1154, 1171\n              (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n\n                                                  30\n\f                      In contrast, “[a]n as-applied challenge concedes that the statute\n              may be constitutional in many of its applications, but contends that it\n              is not so under the particular circumstances of the case.” Id. (emphasis\n              added); see also N.M. Youth Organized v. Herrera, 611 F.3d 669, 677\n              n.5 (10th Cir. 2010) (“[An] ‘as-applied’ challenge to a law\n              acknowledges that the law may have some potential constitutionally\n              permissible applications, but argues that the law is not constitutional as\n              applied to [particular parties].”).\n\nCarel, 668 F.3d at 1217 (alterations in original) (citation omitted).10\n\n       As the Supreme Court has recognized, however, “the distinction between facial\n\nand as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect or that it\n\nmust always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional\n\nchallenge.” Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558 U.S. 310, 331 (2010); see\n\nReed, 561 U.S. at 194 (noting as to the parties’s disagreement regarding whether the\n\nclaim at issue “is properly viewed as a facial or as-applied challenge,” that “[t]he label is\n\nnot what matters”); see also Ctr. for Indiv.

REV. 1321, 1336 (2000) (“Facial challenges are not sharply categorically\n\ndistinct from as-applied challenges to the validity of statutes.”). In other words, “facial”\n\nand “as-applied” are not necessarily antipodal rubrics.\n\n\n\n       10\n                We do not have the benefit of an agreement among the parties regarding the\nnature of the constitutional challenge (i.e., facial or as-applied), like we did in Carel.\nSee 668 F.3d at 1217 (noting that “at oral argument [defense] counsel stated that his\nchallenge . . . is an as-applied challenge” and “Counsel for the Government agreed”).\n\n                                              31\n\f       Indeed, “the line between facial and as-applied relief is a fluid one, and many\n\nconstitutional challenges may occupy an intermediate position on the spectrum between\n\npurely as-applied relief and complete facial invalidation.” Am.

This proposition is especially relevant here. The United States’s\n\nclaim “obviously has characteristics of both” a facial and as-applied claim. Reed, 561\n\nU.S. at 194; see Carel, 668 F.3d at 1217 (“Mr. Carel’s claim that [42 U.S.C.] § 16913 is\n\nunconstitutional has characteristics of both a facial and as-applied challenge.”); see also\n\nCatholic Leadership Coal. of Tex. v.

(“U.S. Response Br.”) at 7; see Aplts.’ App. at 7 (“As applied\n\nto federal prosecutors, New Mexico Rule of Professional Conduct 16-308(E) . . . violates\n\nthe Supremacy Clause . . . .”). Its “claim is ‘as applied’ in the sense that it does not seek\n\nto strike the [New Mexico rule] in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\n\n                                              32\n\f[federal prosecutors licensed to practice law in New Mexico]. The claim is ‘facial’ in that\n\nit is not limited to [a] particular case [i.e., a particular federal prosecutor’s issuance of a\n\nspecific attorney subpoena], but challenges application of the law more broadly to all\n\n[attorney subpoenas issued by all federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico].” Reed,\n\n561 U.S. at 194.\n\n       Put another way, the United States’s claim has characteristics of a facial challenge\n\nbecause it attacks on purely legal grounds—i.e., under the Supremacy Clause—certain\n\nprovisions of Rule 16-308(E) and contends that they are per se invalid. In this regard, the\n\nclaim does not relate to the circumstances of any particular attorney subpoena or any\n\nparticular trial or grand-jury investigation. But the claim also has characteristics of an as-\n\napplied challenge because it focuses solely on the constitutional ramifications of Rule 16-\n\n308(E)’s challenged provisions as they apply to a specific, narrowly defined\n\ngroup—federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico; it does not seek a determination that\n\nthe rule is invalid as applied to any other category of prosecutors (e.g., state or local\n\nprosecutors), and thus not all applications of the challenged provisions are encompassed\n\nby the claim.\n\n       The unique duality of the United States’s preemption claim has engendered\n\ndisagreement among the parties, and also some uncertainty—notably, by the claim’s\n\nproponent, the United States—regarding how to properly characterize it. The United\n\nStates has emphasized in litigating the jurisdictional, prudential justiciability, and\n\ndiscovery issues that the claim is “facial”; in so doing, it has sought to underscore the\n\n                                               33\n\flegal nature of the claim.11 See, e.g., Aplts.’ App. at 116 (Pl.’s Opp. to Defs.’ Mot. to\n\nDismiss, filed Sept. 20, 2013) (stating in opposing Defendants’ motion to dismiss on\n\nstanding and ripeness grounds that the “case is a facial challenge to the constitutionality\n\nof Rule 16-308(E), on grounds that the Rule invades a field completely occupied by\n\nfederal regulation and conflicts with federal law” (emphasis added)); id. at 265 (Pl.’s\n\n(Am.) Combined Opp. to Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. & Reply in Supp. Pl.’s Mot. for\n\nSumm. J., filed Dec. 18, 2013) (citing the district court’s “correct[ ]” holding “that this\n\nmatter is ripe for adjudication because facial challenges based upon preemption are fit for\n\nreview even without additional factual development or actual enforcement of the law”).\n\n       But, in arguing the merits of the preemption claim, the United States has stressed\n\nthat it only seeks to invalidate Rule 16-308(E) as applied to a limited subset of\n\nprosecutors—i.e., federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico. See id. at 20 (seeking a\n\ndeclaration in its complaint that Rule 16-308(E) was “invalid, null, and void, as applied\n\nto federal attorneys for otherwise lawful actions” (emphasis added)); id. at 33 (Mem. in\n\nSupp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Summ.

Rule\n\n\n       11\n                The response of the United States’s counsel to questioning during oral\nargument regarding its use of the labels “facial” and “as-applied” bespeaks some of the\nuncertainty noted above and also specifically sheds light on the United States’s intent\nbehind the use of the label “facial.” Counsel stated that perhaps the United States “used\nthe wrong term in district court . . . because facial challenge is a term of art . . . . [W]hat\nwe meant by that . . . is facial in the sense of this is a purely legal determination based on\nSupremacy Clause principles . . . . What we meant was this is a straight legal\nchallenge . . . .” Oral Argument at 25:40–27:20.\n\n                                              34\n\f16-308(E) is therefore void as applied to federal prosecutors.”); id. at 49 (“[A]s applied to\n\nfederal attorneys, Rule 16-308(E) . . . . is not in fact an ‘ethical’ rule, and is invalid as\n\napplied to federal attorneys[.] . . .”).\n\n       Perhaps not surprisingly, the language of the district court’s orders reflects the\n\nduality of the claim, and it also uses the labels “facial” and “as-applied” in a manner that\n\napproximates the United States’s (i.e., the plaintiff’s) framing of its case. In its decision\n\ndenying New Mexico’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing and ripeness, for example,\n\nthe district court described the action as “facially challenging the New Mexico\n\nRule . . . as it applies to federal prosecutors.” Id. at 143. The court emphasized what it\n\nunderstood to be the facial nature of the challenge. See, e.g., id. at 151 (“The\n\noverwhelming majority of courts hold that cases involving facial challenges based upon\n\npreemption are fit for judicial review even without specific factual development.”). In\n\ndenying Defendants further discovery, the court again held that “facial preemption\n\nchallenges can be decided even in the absence of a detailed factual record. . . . The\n\ndetermination [of whether Rule 16-308(E) is preempted] is based upon the wording of the\n\nrule itself, not factual circumstances surrounding the enactment or enforcement of the\n\nrule.” Id. at 260–61 (Order Den. Pl.’s Mot. to Stay Briefing & Defs.’ 56(D) Req. for\n\nExtension, filed Nov. 27, 2013). Finally, in its order granting partial summary judgment\n\nto both parties, though the court noted that it was addressing a “facial[ ] challeng[e]” to\n\nRule 16-308(E), it also explicitly recognized that the United States sought to declare the\n\nrule invalid only “as it applies to federal prosecutors.” Id. at 306 (Mem. Op. & Order\n\n                                               35\n\fGranting Partial Summ.

More specifically,\n\nDefendants contend that the United States should be judicially estopped on appeal from\n\n“switch[ing] to an as-applied challenge for purposes of avoiding the more stringent\n\nrequirements for prevailing on the merits of a facial preemption challenge” after\n\n“[h]aving obtained the benefit of [ ] rulings from the district court based on a facial\n\nchallenge.” Aplts.’/Cross-Aplees.’ Response and Reply Br. (“Aplts.’ Reply Br.”) at\n\n19–20. They highlight a passage of the United States’s appellate brief, wherein it states\n\nthat “the United States challenges Rule 16-[3]08(E) only as-applied to federal prosecutors\n\nand only to those who seek to take ‘otherwise lawful actions’ prohibited by the New\n\nMexico rule.” U.S. Response Br. at 55 (quoting Aplts.’ App. at 20). The United States\n\ngoes on to argue that certain principles governing facial challenges that the Supreme\n\nCourt has announced do not apply because of the limited scope of its claim. Specifically,\n\nit contends that they “would not apply because the United States is not challenging all of\n\n                                             36\n\fthe applications of the New Mexico Rule, but rather a limited set of applications.” Id. at\n\n56.\n\n       Thus, advocating for the application of facial standards, Defendants contend that\n\nthe United States should be judicially estopped from making such an argument. For two\n\nsalient, independent reasons, however, we reject this contention. Under the judicial-\n\nestoppel doctrine, “[w]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and\n\nsucceeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests\n\nhave changed, assume a contrary position.” New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749\n\n(2001) (quoting Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689 (1895)). While the circumstances\n\nthat trigger judicial estoppel are “not reducible to any general formulation,” id. at 750,\n\n“nevertheless[ ] the Supreme Court has identified three relevant factors,” BancInsure, Inc.\n\nv. FDIC, 796 F.3d 1226, 1240 (10th Cir. 2015), petition for cert. filed sub nom.\n\nMcCaffree v. BancInsure, 84 U.S.L.W. 3433 (U.S. Feb. 1, 2016) (No. 15-982). They are:\n\n(1) “a party’s later position must be ‘clearly inconsistent’ with its earlier position”; (2) the\n\nparty must have “succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party’s earlier position,\n\nso that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create\n\n‘the perception that either the first or second court was misled’”; and (3) allowing the\n\nparty to assert the inconsistent position would result in “an unfair advantage or [would]\n\nimpose an unfair detriment on the opposing party.” New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750–51\n\n(citations omitted); accord Vehicle Mkt. Research, Inc. v. Mitchell Int’l, Inc., 767 F.3d\n\n987, 993 (10th Cir. 2014). “[J]udicial estoppel ‘is an equitable doctrine invoked by a\n\n                                              37\n\fcourt at its discretion.’” New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750 (quoting Russell v. Rolfs, 893\n\nF.2d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 1990)); accord Kaiser v. Bowlen, 455 F.3d 1197, 1204 (10th\n\nCir. 2006). “This circuit applies the doctrine of judicial estoppel ‘both narrowly and\n\ncautiously.’” BancInsure, 796 F.3d at 1240 (quoting Hansen v. Harper Excavating, Inc.,\n\n641 F.3d 1216, 1227 (10th Cir. 2011)). This is because the doctrine is “a powerful\n\nweapon to employ against a party seeking to vindicate its rights, and there are often lesser\n\nweapons that can keep alleged inconsistent statements in check.” Vehicle Mkt. Research,\n\nInc., 767 F.3d at 993; accord BancInsure, 796 F.3d at 1240.\n\n       First, we reject Defendants’ judicial-estoppel argument because the United States’s\n\nlegal arguments in the district court and on appeal are not clearly inconsistent; indeed,\n\nthey are arguably not inconsistent at all. Our caselaw has set a high bar for estoppel\n\nproponents seeking to show that two positions are clearly inconsistent. See, e.g., Vehicle\n\nMkt. Research, 767 F.3d at 994–96; Ellis v. Ark. La. Gas Co., 609 F.2d 436, 440 (10th\n\nCir. 1979). And we find validation for our narrow and cautious approach in this regard,\n\nsee BancInsure, 796 F.3d at 1240, in the decisions of our sister circuits. In the words of\n\nthe Second Circuit, “If the statements can be reconciled there is no occasion to apply an\n\nestoppel.” Simon v. Safelite Glass Corp., 128 F.3d 68, 73 (2d. Cir. 1997) (applying\n\njudicial estoppel because plaintiff told the Social Security Administration that he was\n\n“unable to work,” which was “patently and admittedly contrary to his central claim in this\n\ncase that he is able to work”); see United States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 337 (2d Cir.\n\n2015) (noting that its precedent has “emphasized the need to ‘carefully consider the\n\n                                             38\n\fcontexts in which apparently contradictory statements are made to determine if there is, in\n\nfact, direct and irreconcilable contradiction’” and concluding that a party’s “facially\n\ninconsistent” arguments were not clearly inconsistent because there was a factual basis in\n\nthe record for distinguishing the arguments (quoting Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of\n\nOnondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir. 2004))); see also Lorillard Tobacco Co. v.\n\nChester, Willcox & Saxbe, LLP, 546 F.3d 752, 757–58 (6th Cir. 2008) (noting that the\n\njudicial-estoppel doctrine is applied cautiously and that “there is no inconsistency, and\n\ncertainly no clear inconsistency” in the challenged arguments).\n\n       As we read it, the substance of the United States’s arguments before the district\n\ncourt and on appeal are not clearly inconsistent. In both settings, the United States has\n\npresented a legal preemption challenge to the validity of provisions of Rule 16-308(E), as\n\nthey apply to a limited subset of prosecutors—that is, federal prosecutors licensed in New\n\nMexico. True, in emphasizing the legal nature of its challenge in litigating the\n\njurisdictional, prudential justiciability, and discovery issues before the district court, it\n\ndenominated its claim as “facial,” whereas on appeal it seems to have avoided this label,\n\nbut the substance of its argument on appeal is not clearly inconsistent with the argument it\n\nmade below. Compare, e.g., Aplts.’ App. at 116–17 (in opposing Defendants’ motion to\n\ndismiss on standing and ripeness grounds, stating that the “case is a facial challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of Rule 16-308(E)” and that “the complaint has alleged each way in\n\nwhich the Rule is at odds with federal law and therefore violates the Supremacy Clause”),\n\nwith U.S. Response Br. at 18 (“The district court also correctly found that this case is ripe\n\n                                               39\n\ffor adjudication. Its resolution requires no further factual development . . . . The\n\nSupremacy Clause challenge here presents purely legal questions . . . .”). And, on\n\nappeal—as before the district court—the United States has emphasized that it only seeks\n\nto invalidate provisions of Rule 16-308(E) as applied to a limited subset of\n\nprosecutors—i.e., federal prosecutors. Compare, e.g., U.S. Response Br. at 55 (stating\n\nthat “the United States challenges Rule 16-[3]08(E) only as-applied to federal\n\nprosecutors”), with Aplts.’ App. at 49 (“[A]s applied to federal attorneys,\n\nRule 16-308(E) . . . . is not in fact an ‘ethical’ rule, and is invalid as applied to federal\n\nattorneys . . . .”).\n\n        Defendants’ argument to the contrary elides the unique duality of the claim and\n\noperates on the assumption that the United States’s challenge must be either “facial” or\n\n“as-applied”; under their reasoning, it cannot have characteristics of both. As noted\n\nabove, however, such an antipodal limitation is not required. See Reed, 561 U.S. at 194\n\n(noting that the claim at issue “obviously has characteristics of both” a facial and as-\n\napplied claim). And, in fact, the United States’s preemption claim has characteristics of\n\nboth a “facial” and an “as-applied” challenge. In sum, our first reason for rejecting\n\nDefendants’ judicial-estoppel argument is because the United States’s arguments in the\n\ndistrict court and on appeal are not clearly inconsistent.\n\n        Our second reason is because any ostensible inconsistency would involve solely\n\nlegal arguments; however, under our precedent, “the position to be estopped must\n\ngenerally be one of fact rather than of law or legal theory.” Johnson v. Lindon City\n\n                                               40\n\fCorp., 405 F.3d 1065, 1069 (10th Cir. 2005); see also BancInsure, 796 F.3d at 1240\n\n(“Notably, we have held that judicial estoppel only applies when the position to be\n\nestopped is one of fact, not one of law.”); United States v. Villagrana-Flores, 467 F.3d\n\n1269, 1279 (10th Cir. 2006) (“Even if we were to agree that the government took two\n\nclearly conflicting positions, . . . the existence of a Fourth Amendment violation is a legal\n\nposition, not a factual one, and therefore the first judicial estoppel factor has not been\n\nsatisfied.”). It cannot be disputed that the facial and as-applied rubrics are legal in nature\n\nand form the basis for legal arguments. Therefore, even if the United States has shifted\n\non appeal from the position it held in the district court regarding the nature of its\n\nclaim—viz., from viewing it as facial to as-applied—that shift would be legal in nature.\n\nConsequently, under our precedent, the judicial-estoppel doctrine would be inapposite.12\n\n       In sum, for these two salient, independent reasons, we reject Defendants’ judicial-\n\nestoppel contention.\n\n                                               3\n\n       Having concluded that the United States’s argument with respect to its uniquely\n\ndual preemption claim is not barred by the judicial-estoppel doctrine, we must still\n\n\n\n       12\n              Of course, “lesser weapons,” Vehicle Mkt. Research, 767 F.3d at 993, in the\nform of the doctrines of waiver or forfeiture might be employed in certain circumstances\nwhen a party changes its position on a legal issue on appeal, see, e.g., Richison v. Ernest\nGrp., Inc., 634 F.3d 1123, 1127–28 (10th Cir. 2011). However, Defendants have not\nsought to invoke either of these weapons in connection with the United States’s purported\nchange of position regarding the nature of its claim, and we decline to assay the matter\nsua sponte.\n\n                                              41\n\fdetermine which analytical construct—facial or as-applied—is the appropriate one for\n\npurposes of conducting the substantive preemption analysis. The parties’ arguments\n\nreflect disagreement on this point. Defendants vigorously contend that facial standards\n\nshould govern the resolution of the United States’s preemption claim; in particular, they\n\nadvocate for the use of the rigorous no-set-of-circumstances test, which is perhaps most\n\nclosely associated with the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Salerno, 481\n\nU.S. 739, 745 (1987) (“A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most\n\ndifficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of\n\ncircumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”); see also Cal. Coastal\n\nComm’n v. Granite Rock Co., 480 U.S. 572, 588–89 (1987) (“In the present posture of\n\nthis litigation, the Coastal Commission’s identification of a possible set of permit\n\nconditions not pre-empted by federal law is sufficient to rebuff Granite Rock’s facial\n\nchallenge to the permit requirement.”); Reed, 561 U.S. at 231 (Thomas, J., dissenting)\n\n(citing Salerno, and describing the no-set-of-circumstances test as “our most rigorous\n\nstandard”); see also Aplts.’ Opening Br. at 54–55 (“All that is required to defeat\n\nPlaintiff’s facial challenge is the conclusion that Plaintiff has not met its burden of\n\nproving that Rule 16-308(E) necessarily and irreconcilably conflicts with federal grand\n\njury practice in all instances”). The United States appears to generally resist application\n\nof a facial standard and, most notably, flatly rejects application of the Salerno standard,\n\ncontending that it “would not apply because the United States is not challenging all of the\n\napplications of the New Mexico Rule, but rather a limited set of applications.” U.S.\n\n                                              42\n\fResponse Br. at 56.\n\n       We conclude, under the parameters defined below, that the standards for a facial\n\nclaim are appropriate here.\n\n                                               a\n\n       As noted, the United States’s “claim is ‘as applied’ in the sense that it does not\n\nseek to strike the [Rule 16-308(E)] in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\n\n[federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico]. The claim is ‘facial’ in that it is not\n\nlimited to [a] particular case [i.e., a particular federal prosecutor’s issuance of a specific\n\nattorney subpoena], but challenges application of the law more broadly to all [attorney\n\nsubpoenas issued by all federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico].” Reed, 561 U.S. at\n\n194. The Supreme Court’s decision in Reed is instructive in discerning the appropriate\n\nlegal standard for resolution of this case because there (as the First Circuit observed) the\n\nCourt “faced a similar duality in the First Amendment Context.” Showtime Entm’t, 769\n\nF.3d at 70.\n\n       The foundation for the lawsuit in Reed was the public-records statute (“PRA”) of\n\nthe State of Washington, which “authorize[d] private parties to obtain copies of\n\ngovernment documents, and the State construe[d] the PRA to cover submitted referendum\n\npetitions.” 561 U.S. at 191. The Court succinctly introduced the case’s factual\n\nbackground, the legal issue, and its resolution of it:\n\n                     This case arises out of a state law extending certain benefits to\n              same-sex couples, and a corresponding referendum petition to put that\n              law to a popular vote. Respondent intervenors invoked the PRA to\n\n                                                   43\n\f              obtain copies of the petition, with the names and addresses of the\n              signers. Certain petition signers and the petition sponsor objected,\n              arguing that such public disclosure would violate their rights under the\n              First Amendment.\n\n                     The course of this litigation, however, has framed the legal\n              question before us more broadly. The issue at this stage of the case is\n              not whether disclosure of this particular petition would violate the First\n              Amendment, but whether disclosure of referendum petitions in general\n              would do so. We conclude that such disclosure does not as a general\n              matter violate the First Amendment, and we therefore affirm the\n              judgment of the Court of Appeals. We leave it to the lower courts to\n              consider in the first instance the signers’ more focused claim\n              concerning disclosure of the information on this particular petition,\n              which is pending before the District Court.\n\nId.\n\n       In the claim at issue in Reed, the plaintiffs averred that the PRA “violates the First\n\nAmendment as applied to referendum petitions.” Id. at 194 (emphasis added) (quoting\n\nCount I of the Complaint). As here, the parties jousted about whether the claim was\n\n“properly viewed as a facial or as-applied challenge.” Id. The Court, however,\n\nrecognized that facial and as-applied are not mutually exclusive or antipodal constructs,\n\nobserving that the claim “obviously has characteristics of both.” Id. Elaborating, the\n\nCourt said:\n\n                      The claim is “as applied” in the sense that it does not seek to\n              strike the PRA in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\n              referendum petitions. The claim is “facial” in that it is not limited to\n              plaintiffs’ particular case, but challenges application of the law more\n              broadly to all referendum petitions.\n\nId.\n\n       Critically for our purposes, the Court then offered guidance on how—in the\n\n                                             44\n\fcontext of such duality—to determine which analytical construct is most apt for\n\nresolution of the underlying substantive claim. It began by observing that “[t]he label\n\n[i.e., facial or as-applied] is not what matters.” Id. “The important point,” it said, is\n\nwhether the “plaintiffs’ claim and the relief that would follow . . . reach beyond the\n\nparticular circumstances of the[ ] plaintiffs.” Id. The Court concluded that this was true\n\nin that case, where the plaintiffs sought in the claim at issue “an injunction barring the\n\nsecretary of state ‘from making referendum petitions available to the public,’” not just an\n\ninjunction barring the public disclosure of the referendum petition involving them,\n\nrelating to same-sex marriage. Id. (quoting Count I of the Complaint). As such, the\n\nCourt concluded that, irrespective of the “label” that the plaintiffs attached to their claim,\n\n“[t]hey must therefore satisfy our standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that\n\nreach.” Id.\n\n       We read Reed as offering three key lessons for discerning the appropriate\n\nanalytical lens for conducting a substantive constitutional analysis—lessons that are\n\napplicable at least where the claims evince a duality as here: first, the labels the parties\n\nattach to claims are not determinative; second, in determining whether to apply facial\n\nstandards to the claim, importantly, the court must focus on whether the claim and the\n\nrelief therein extend beyond the plaintiffs’ particular circumstances; and third, if the claim\n\nand relief do so, facial standards are applied but only to the universe of applications\n\ncontemplated by plaintiffs’ claim, not to all conceivable applications contemplated by the\n\nchallenged provision. See, e.g., Showtime Entm’t, 769 F.3d at 70 (in holding that facial\n\n                                              45\n\fstandards apply, stating “[w]e understand the relief sought here to be the invalidation of\n\nthe zoning bylaws, not merely a change in their application to Showtime[;] . . . . it is clear\n\nthat this is a request that ‘reach[es] beyond’ the precise circumstances of Showtime’s\n\nlicense application” (third alteration in original) (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194));\n\nCatholic Leadership Coal., 764 F.3d at 426 (“[T]o categorize a challenge as facial or as-\n\napplied we look to see whether the ‘claim and the relief that would follow . . . reach\n\nbeyond the particular circumstances of the [ ] plaintiffs.’ If so, regardless of how the\n\nchallenge is labeled by a plaintiff, ‘[t]hey must therefore satisfy our standards for a facial\n\nchallenge to the extent of that reach.’” (second and third alterations in original) (citation\n\nomitted) (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194)); Discount Tobacco City & Lottery, Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, 674 F.3d 509, 522 (6th Cir. 2012) (“In this case, Plaintiffs label their\n\nclaims as both facial and as-applied challenges to the Act, but because the ‘plaintiffs’\n\nclaim and the relief that would follow . . . reach beyond the particular circumstances of\n\nthese plaintiffs,’ the claims that are raised are properly reviewed as facial challenges to\n\nthe Act.” (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194)); see also Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun.\n\nEmps. Council 79, 717 F.3d at 862 (“We look to the scope of the relief requested to\n\ndetermine whether a challenge is facial or as-applied in nature.”).\n\n       Further explication may clarify the contours of the third lesson. As noted, a\n\nparadigmatic facial challenge is “a head-on attack [on a] legislative judgment, an\n\nassertion that the challenged statute violates the Constitution in all, or virtually all, of its\n\napplications.” Carel, 668 F.3d at 1217 (quoting Pruitt, 502 F.3d at 1171). However,\n\n                                               46\n\fwhere the claim at issue evinces the kind of duality at issue here—that is, reflects\n\ncharacteristics of both facial and as-applied challenges—the facial analysis that Reed\n\nenvisions is more limited in scope than that employed for paradigmatic facial claims.13\n\nSpecifically, the analysis does not attempt to assay the constitutional validity of all or\n\nvirtually all of the applications of the challenged provision. Instead, it focuses on only\n\nthe constitutional validity of the subset of applications targeted by the plaintiffs’\n\nsubstantive claim. Consequently, using the language of Reed, plaintiffs asserting such a\n\ndual claim are obliged to “satisfy our standards for a facial challenge” but only “to the\n\nextent of that [claim’s] reach”—which means only insofar as the claim is actually facial\n\nin character, in that it “reach[es] beyond the particular circumstances of the[ ] plaintiffs.”\n\nReed, 561 U.S. at 194.\n\n       This third lesson was concretely displayed in Reed. The Court concluded that the\n\nfacial standard should be applied to the plaintiffs’ dual claim—a claim that, in part,\n\n“obviously ha[d] characteristics of” a facial challenge, id.—because their claim attacked\n\nthe public records statute’s disclosure requirements related to “referendum petitions in\n\ngeneral,” not only the disclosure requirements as they applied to the particular\n\nreferendum petition at issue involving same-sex marriage, id. at 191. Demonstrating the\n\nthird lesson, Reed only applied a facial analysis to the public records statute insofar as it\n\n\n\n       13\n               Indeed, one of our sister circuits has recognized that these dual claims are\nqualitatively distinct from paradigmatic facial claims by describing the former as “quasi-\nfacial in nature.” Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., 717 F.3d at 863.\n\n                                              47\n\fwas construed to reach referendum petitions—not to the statute as a whole, which applied\n\nto other records as well. See id. at 194. In other words, Reed applied the facial analysis\n\nto the public records statute “to the extent [that the claim’s] reach” went beyond the\n\ndisclosure requirements related to the same-sex marriage referendum petitions to include\n\nreferendum petitions generally—but, critically, no further than that. See id. Some of our\n\nsister circuits appear to have tacitly recognized and applied Reed’s third lesson. See, e.g.,\n\nShowtime Entm’t, 769 F.3d at 70–71 (applying facial analysis to claim that extended\n\nbeyond plaintiff’s specific circumstances—that is, a license application—but extending it\n\nno further than the zoning ordinance impacting plaintiff and other adjacent landowners\n\nengaged in the same business); Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., 717 F.3d at 865\n\n(in the context of a dual claim “conclud[ing] that the district court granted what\n\neffectively amounted to facial relief—or, at the very least, relief that had enough\n\ncharacteristics of facial relief to demand satisfaction” of facial standards, and proceeding\n\nto apply those standards only to the extent that the challenged executive order reached\n\nbeyond the particular circumstances of the plaintiffs).\n\n       Guided by Reed and its three key lessons, we conclude that facial standards should\n\nbe applied to the United States’s preemption claim but only to the extent that the\n\nchallenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) impact federal prosecutors licensed in New\n\nMexico and their attorney-subpoena practices. First, because labels are not important, the\n\nUnited States’s use of as-applied verbiage in its complaint, see Aplts.’ App. at 20\n\n(seeking a declaration in its complaint that Rule 16-308(E) was “invalid, null, and void,\n\n                                             48\n\fas applied to federal attorneys for otherwise lawful actions” (emphasis added)), should\n\nnot deter us from determining whether facial standards actually provide the appropriate\n\ntouchstone. See Reed, 561 U.S. at 194 (applying facial standards, though the count of the\n\ncomplaint at issue alleged that the PRA “violate[d] the First Amendment as applied to\n\nreferendum petitions” (emphasis added) (quoting Count I of the Complaint)). Second, the\n\nUnited States’s claim and its desired relief clearly extend beyond the particular\n\ncircumstances of any particular federal prosecutor issuing an attorney subpoena. The\n\nUnited States has sought to bar enforcement of certain provisions of Rule 16-308(E)\n\nrelative to all federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico who issue attorney\n\nsubpoenas—irrespective, for example, of the evidentiary needs of a particular grand-jury\n\ninvestigation. Accordingly, following Reed, we rightly apply facial standards to the\n\nresolution of the United States’s claim. Finally, applying Reed’s third lesson, the facial\n\nanalysis should extend to a preemption analysis of the challenged provisions Rule 16-\n\n308(E), but only insofar as they apply to federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico who\n\nissue attorney subpoenas.14 We turn now to determine whether Salerno’s no-set-of-\n\ncircumstances language or some other rubric is the appropriate one to apply here.\n\n\n       14\n              Indeed, although starting from different places, both parties appear to\nacknowledge that the relevant universe for analysis is this federal-prosecutor group.\nCompare Aplts.’ Reply Br. at 3–4 (“Plaintiff must meet its burden to show that there is no\nset of circumstances under which Rule 16-308(E) could apply with respect to a\nprosecutor’s conduct in issuing a federal grand subpoena to an attorney.”), with U.S.\nResponse Br. at 56 (noting that “the United States is not challenging all of the\napplications of the New Mexico Rule, but rather a limited set of applications” involving\n“federal prosecutors who issue grand jury subpoenas”).\n\n                                             49\n\f                                             b\n\n                                              i\n\n       Defendants argue that, in order to meet the “standard[ ] for a facial challenge,”\n\nAplts.’ Reply Br. at 51–52 (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194), the United States must\n\ndemonstrate that “no set of circumstances exists under which [Rule 16-308(E)] would be\n\nvalid,” Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745. As noted, the United States contends that Salerno’s\n\nfacial standards are inapplicable here.15\n\n       While both the Supreme Court and our court have questioned whether Salerno’s\n\nno-set-of-circumstances language applies to all facial challenges, see, e.g., United States\n\nv. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 472 (2010); Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican\n\nParty, 552 U.S. 442, 449 (2008); Doe v. City of Albuquerque, 667 F.3d 1111, 1123 (10th\n\n\n       15\n               The United States’s resistance to Salerno’s no-set-of-circumstances\nlanguage appears to rest in part on a misunderstanding regarding the universe of possible\napplications (i.e., circumstances) that would be at issue under that formula as used here.\nIn this regard, the United States says, “The Salerno standard would not apply because the\nUnited States is not challenging all of the applications of the New Mexico Rule, but\nrather a limited set of applications.” U.S. Response Br. at 56 (emphasis added).\nHowever, as we noted supra in the immediately preceding section discussing the third\nlesson that we glean from Reed, facial standards may be applicable even when plaintiffs\nchallenge only a limited subset of the conceivable applications of a challenged\nprovision—viz., if their claims evince the kind of duality or “quasi-facial” character at\nissue here, Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., 717 F.3d at 863 (noting that “Salerno\nalso applies when a court grants relief that is quasi-facial in nature”)—but only to the\nextent of the challenged subset. See Reed, 561 U.S. at 194. Indeed, Defendants do not\nmaintain that the proffered Salerno no-set-of-circumstances test should extend beyond the\nattorney-subpoena practices of federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico. In any event,\nfor the reasons noted infra, we are content to assume that the Salerno no-set-of-\ncircumstances language is controlling, and we apply it consistent with Reed’s third lesson\nand our precedent interpreting Salerno.\n\n                                             50\n\fCir. 2012); Hernandez-Carrera v. Carlson, 547 F.3d 1237, 1255 (10th Cir. 2008), the\n\nSupreme Court has previously applied this language in at least two preemption cases, see\n\nAnderson v. Edwards, 514 U.S. 143, 155 n.6 (1995); Cal. Coastal Comm’n, 480 U.S. at\n\n593; see also Villas at Parkside Partners v. City of Farmers Branch, 726 F.3d 524, 564\n\n(5th Cir. 2013) (applying Salerno to a facial preemption challenge). We thus are prepared\n\nto assume arguendo that Salerno’s no-set-of-circumstances language does apply here.\n\n       Even so, we have construed Salerno’s no-set-of-circumstances language “not as\n\nsetting forth a test for facial challenges, but rather as describing the result of a facial\n\nchallenge in which a statute fails to satisfy the appropriate constitutional standard.” Doe,\n\n667 F.3d at 1127; see also Marc E. Isserles, Overcoming Overbreadth: Facial Challenges\n\n& the Valid Rule Requirement, 48 AM. U. L. REV. 359, 386 (1998) (“Salerno is best\n\nunderstood, not as a facial challenge ‘test’ at all, but rather as a descriptive claim about a\n\nstatute whose terms state an invalid rule of law . . . .”). A facial challenge is best\n\nunderstood as “a challenge to the terms of the statute, not hypothetical applications,” Doe,\n\n667 F.3d at 1127, and is resolved “simply by applying the relevant constitutional test to\n\nthe challenged statute without attempting to conjure up whether or not there is a\n\nhypothetical situation in which application of the statute might be valid,” id. at 1124; see\n\nalso City of Los Angeles v. Patel, --- U.S. ----, 135 S. Ct. 2443, 2451 (2015) (stating that,\n\nin resolving a facial challenge, “the Court has considered only applications of the statute\n\nin which it actually authorizes or prohibits conduct,” and not every hypothetical\n\npossibility); Fallon, supra, at 1328 (“In a practical sense, doctrinal tests of constitutional\n\n                                               51\n\fvalidity can thus produce what are effectively facial challenges.”). “In other words,\n\nwhere a statute fails the relevant constitutional test . . . it can no longer be constitutionally\n\napplied to anyone—and thus there is ‘no set of circumstances’ in which the statute would\n\nbe valid.” Doe, 667 F.3d at 1127.\n\n                                                ii\n\n       In this case, the relevant constitutional test for assaying the facial validity of the\n\nchallenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) involves the preemption doctrine. The basic\n\ntaxonomy of that doctrine—which is based on the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, U.S.\n\nConst. art. VI, § 2—is well-established: “Put simply, federal law preempts contrary state\n\nlaw.” Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, --- U.S. ----, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1297 (2016);\n\nsee, e.g., Arizona v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2500–01 (2012); U.S.\n\nAirways, Inc. v. O’Donnell, 627 F.3d 1318, 1324 (10th Cir. 2010). More specifically,\n\namong the “three types of preemption,” U.S. Airways, 627 F.3d at 1324, the one relevant\n\nhere is called conflict preemption.16 In that species of preemption, a state-law provision\n\n\n       16\n               The other two are called express preemption and field preemption. See,\ne.g., English v. Gen. Elec. Co., 496 U.S. 72, 79–80 (1990) (noting, as to express\npreemption, that “Congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments\npre-empt state law”; and, as to field preemption, that “state law is pre-empted where it\nregulates conduct in a field that Congress intended the Federal Government to occupy\nexclusively”); see also U.S. Airways, 627 F.3d at 1324 (stating, in enumerating the two\nothers, that “1) ‘express preemption, which occurs when the language of the federal\nstatute reveals an express congressional intent to preempt state law;’ [and] 2) ‘field\npreemption, which occurs when the federal scheme of regulation is so pervasive that\nCongress must have intended to leave no room for a State to supplement it . . . .’”\n(quoting Mount Olivet Cemetery Ass’n v. Salt Lake City, 164 F.3d 480, 486 (10th Cir.\n1998))). But cf. Hughes, 136 S.

In the easier but far rarer case, compliance with both federal and state\n\nduties is simply impossible. In the second and more common situation, compliance with\n\nboth laws is possible, yet state law poses an obstacle to the achievement of federal\n\npurposes.” (citation omitted)).17\n\n       Generally speaking, “[t]here is no federal pre-emption in vacuo, without a\n\n\nCourt’s “general exhortation not to rely on talismanic pre-emption vocabulary”).\n       17\n               Conflict preemption is a form of implied preemption. See, e.g., Gade v.\nNat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 98 (1992) (noting the Court’s historical\nrecognition of “at least two types of implied pre-emption,” that is, “field pre-emption”\nand “conflict pre-emption”); Chamber of Commerce v. Edmondson, 594 F.3d 742, 765\n(10th Cir. 2010) (noting that “state laws may be impliedly preempted either as a result of\nconflict or field preemption”); Choate v.

See, e.g., Crosby, 530 U.S. at 363, 373, 374 n.8 (noting that\n\n“[w]e find that the state law undermines the intended purpose and ‘natural effect’ of at\n\nleast three provisions of the federal Act” and “declin[ing] . . . to pass on the First Circuit’s\n\nrulings addressing the foreign affairs power and the dormant Foreign Commerce\n\nClause”); Choate v.

In resolving the preemption claim in that case, we framed the inquiry as\n\nfollows: “whether [the rule] violates the Supremacy Clause . . . turns on whether the rule\n\nis a rule of professional ethics clearly covered by the McDade Act, or a substantive or\n\nprocedural rule that is inconsistent with federal law.” Id. at 1284. Even though we\n\ndetermined that the rule was an ethics rule, we nevertheless examined whether this ethics\n\nrule was otherwise “inconsistent with federal law” and thus preempted. Id. at 1289. We\n\n\n\n\n       19\n              This approach of applying the preemption doctrine to the terms of Rule 16-\n308(E) rather than speculating about potential valid applications accords with how other\ncircuit panels—including a panel of our own in Colorado Supreme Court II—have\naddressed preemption challenges to state ethics rules. See, e.g., Stern, 214 F.3d at 20–21;\nColorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1288–89; Baylson, 975 F.2d at 111–12.\n\n                                             56\n\fapply this analytical framework to the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E).20\n\n                                              a\n\n       The McDade Act explicitly subjects federal attorneys “to State laws and\n\nrules . . . governing attorneys in each State . . . to the same extent and in the same manner\n\n\n       20\n               Our esteemed colleague in dissent contends that our examination in\nColorado Supreme Court II of whether Colorado’s Rule 3.8—which we had determined\nwas an ethics rule—was “inconsistent with federal law,” 189 F.3d at 1289, was “a brief\naside at the end of the opinion,” Dissent at 7, without decisional significance. In this\nvein, the dissent contends that “the first and only question we must answer is: whether the\nrule is one governing ethics? If it is, considering the burden on federal interests is\nunnecessary because Congress has authorized the rule’s application to federal\nprosecutors.” Dissent at 3. We must respectfully disagree. The panel in Colorado\nSupreme Court II effectively engaged in a conflict-preemption analysis—an inquiry into\nthe presence of impermissible inconsistency vel non with federal law—after determining\nthat Colorado Rule 3.8 was an ethics rule, and expressly rendered a holding on the\npreemption question. In this regard, we stated there:\n\n                      [W]e hold that Rule 3.8, in its mandate that a federal prosecutor\n              ought not to disturb an attorney-client relationship without a showing\n              of cause, does not conflict with Fed. R. CIM. P. 17, which details only\n              the procedures for issuing a proper subpoena. Rule 17 does not\n              abrogate the power of courts to hold an attorney to the broad normative\n              principles of attorney self-conduct. Accordingly, we hold that Rule 3.8\n              is not inconsistent with federal law and can be adopted and enforced by\n              the state defendants against federal prosecutors.\n\nColorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1288–89 (emphases added). It is pellucid that\nwe considered our holding regarding the absence of an impermissible inconsistency (i.e.,\nthe absence of a conflict) with federal law essential to our conclusion that Colorado could\nenforce Rule 3.8 against federal prosecutors in the trial (i.e., non-grand-jury context). It\nwas not an aside or casual piece of dictum that we may now disregard. Therefore,\ncontrary to the dissent, in applying the rule of Colorado Supreme Court II, we do not\nbelieve that our analysis can end if we determine that Rule 16-308(E) is an ethics rule.\nInstead, we must still determine whether Rule 16-308(E) conflicts with relevant federal\nlaw.\n\n\n                                             57\n\fas other attorneys in that State.” 28 U.S.C. § 530B(a). In Colorado Supreme Court II, we\n\nconsidered whether the Colorado rule could be deemed an ethics rule—notably, a\n\n“normative legal standard[ ] that guides the conduct of an attorney”—such that it fell\n\nwithin the McDade Act’s purview. 189 F.3d at 1285. We defined an ethics rule as one\n\nthat: (1) “bar[s] conduct recognized by consensus within the profession as inappropriate”;\n\n(2) is phrased as “a commandment dealing with morals and principles”; (3) is “vague\n\n[and] sweeping” rather than highly specific; and (4) is “directed at the attorney herself”\n\nrather than “at the progress of the claim.” Id. at 1287–88. Measured against these\n\ncriteria, we concluded that the Colorado rule was an ethics rule of the type that the\n\nMcDade Act contemplates. More specifically, as we saw it, the rule sought to safeguard\n\nthe attorney-client relationship—which “by general consensus of our profession [is]\n\nworthy of protection”—and was phrased as a vague, sweeping commandment “directed at\n\nthe prosecutor, not at the cause of action.” Id. at 1288.\n\n       This reasoning applies with equal force to Rule 16-308(E). It contains identical\n\nlanguage to that found in Colorado Rule 3.8(e), and, as the commentary to the rule makes\n\nclear, it is intended to limit the issuance of attorney subpoenas to only “those situations in\n\nwhich there is a genuine need to intrude into the client-lawyer relationship.” N.M. Rules\n\nof Prof’l Conduct, N.M.R.A. 16-308(E) cmt. 4. As such, under Colorado Supreme Court\n\nII, Rule 16-308(E) is an ethics rule of the sort covered by the McDade Act.21\n\n\n       21\n               In contrast, in Stern, the First Circuit concluded that the Massachusetts rule\nat issue “clearly extend[ed] beyond the shelter that section 530B provides” because it\n\n                                             58\n\f                                              b\n\n       We must next determine whether the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E),\n\ndespite being within the purview of the McDade Act, are otherwise inconsistent with (i.e.,\n\nconflict with) federal law. As evident from the analysis in Colorado Supreme Court II,\n\nthe fact that a challenged state rule is determined to be an ethics rule within the McDade\n\nAct’s ambit does not necessarily mean that Congress intended that rule to trump or\n\nimpede the effectuation of otherwise applicable federal law. See Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt II, 189 F.3d at 1289 (proceeding to determine whether the ethics rule covered by\n\nthe McDade Act was otherwise “inconsistent with federal law”); see also Stern, 214 F.3d\n\nat 19 (“[I]t simply cannot be said that Congress, by enacting section 530B, meant to\n\nempower states (or federal district courts, for that matter) to regulate government\n\nattorneys in a manner inconsistent with federal law.”); cf. United States v. Lowery, 166\n\nF.3d 1119, 1125 (11th Cir. 1999) (“When it comes to the admissibility of evidence in\n\nfederal court, the federal interest in enforcement of federal law, including federal\n\nevidentiary rules, is paramount. State rules of professional conduct, or state rules on any\n\nsubject, cannot trump the Federal Rules of Evidence. . . . There is nothing in the language\n\nor legislative history of the [McDade] Act that would support such a radical notion.”).\n\nIndeed, courts have specifically concluded that a Supremacy Clause analysis may still be\n\nappropriate and necessary in instances where Congress has granted states regulatory\n\n\n\n“add[ed] a novel procedural step—the opportunity for a pre-service adversarial hearing.”\n214 F.3d at 20. New Mexico Rule 16-308(E) contains no such procedural hurdle.\n\n                                             59\n\fauthority through language similar to that employed by the McDade Act (e.g., “to the\n\nsame extent . . . as”).

Train, 426 U.S. 167, 173, 182 n.41, 198 (1976)\n\n(holding with reference to 42 U.S.C. § 1857f, which requires federal agencies engaged in\n\nactivities producing air pollution to comply with state “requirements respecting control\n\nand abatement of air pollution to the same extent that any person is subject to such\n\nrequirements,” that Congress did not “evince[ ] with satisfactory clarity” the intent to\n\n“subject[ ] federal installations to state permit requirements”); Colo. Dep’t of Pub. Health\n\n& Env’t, Hazardous Materials & Waste Mgmt. Div. v. United States, 693 F.3d 1214, 1217\n\n(10th Cir. 2012) (noting, where “the federal government and its agencies must comply\n\nwith an [Environmental Protection Agency] authorized state program regulating\n\nhazardous waste” under 42 U.S.C. § 6961 “to the same extent, as any person,” that the\n\ncongressional grant of regulatory authority to the states “does not insulate a state\n\nregulation from federal preemption”).\n\n                                               i\n\n       The United States concedes that Colorado Supreme Court II dictates the answer to\n\nthe otherwise-inconsistent-with-federal-law inquiry with respect to criminal proceedings\n\nin the trial (i.e., outside of the grand-jury) context. Specifically, the United States\n\nacknowledges that Rule 16-308(E) does not conflict with federal law governing trial\n\nsubpoenas; therefore, it is not preempted. In this regard, in Colorado Supreme Court II,\n\nwe determined that a Colorado ethics rule (i.e., Rule 3.8(e)) that had language identical to\n\nRule 16-308(E) was not in conflict with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17—which,\n\n                                              60\n\fgenerally speaking, governs the process for subpoenaing testimonial and documentary\n\nevidence for trial—because Rule 17 was procedural and did “not abrogate the power of\n\ncourts to hold an attorney to the broad normative principles of attorney self-conduct.”\n\n189 F.3d at 1289.22 The United States wisely acknowledges that this holding is\n\ndispositive here. Therefore, we conclude that the district court appropriately determined\n\nthat the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) are not preempted relative to federal\n\nprosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas in criminal proceedings outside of the grand-\n\njury context.23\n\n       22\n              Notably, we distinguished Baylson, in which the Third Circuit held that\nPennsylvania’s attorney-subpoena rule was preempted in the trial context, because the\nPennsylvania rule contained a judicial preapproval requirement and Rule 17 makes “no\nallowances for the court’s intervention in the subpoena procedures.” Colorado Supreme\nCourt II, 189 F.3d at 1286. Like the Colorado rule, Rule 16-308(E) contains no such\npreapproval requirement.\n       23\n               We recognize that after we issued Colorado Supreme Court II, the First\nCircuit in Stern held that “the ‘essentiality’ and ‘no feasible alternative’ requirements [of\nthe largely similar ethics rule at issue there] are substantially more onerous . . . than the\ntraditional motion-to-quash standards” of Rule 17. 214 F.3d at 18. Specifically, the First\nCircuit held that essentiality is “a more demanding criterion than relevancy or\nmateriality” and that “Rule 17 jurisprudence contains no corollary to the” no-other-\nfeasible-alternative requirement. Id. It thus concluded that these “novel\nrequirements . . . threaten[ed] to preclude the service of otherwise unimpeachable\nsubpoenas and thus restrict[ed] the flow of relevant, material evidence to the factfinder.”\nId. In substance, the court concluded that the essentiality and no-other-feasible-\nalternative provisions conflicted with otherwise applicable federal law relative to trial\nsubpoenas (i.e., subpoenas issued outside of the grand-jury context) and were thus\npreempted. Notwithstanding the First Circuit’s contrary reasoning in Stern, we remain\nbound by our controlling decision in Colorado Supreme Court II, which concluded that a\nrule identical to Rule 16-308(E) did not run afoul of federal law governing trial\nsubpoenas. See Muscogee (Creek) Nation v. Okla. Tax Comm’n, 611 F.3d 1222, 1230 n.5\n(10th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he precedent of prior panels which we must follow includes not\nonly the very narrow holdings of those prior cases, but also the reasoning underlying\n\n                                             61\n\f                                              ii\n\n       Though its mode of analysis is still relevant, Colorado Supreme Court II’s holding\n\ndoes not speak to the question before us: specifically, the court did not address whether\n\nthe challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) are preempted in the grand-jury context. See\n\n189 F.3d at 1284. Resolving this question as a matter of first impression, we conclude\n\nthat Rule 16-308(E)’s challenged provisions are conflict-preempted24 in the grand-jury\n\nsetting because the essentiality and no-other-feasible-alternative requirements pose “an\n\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives” of the\n\nfederal legal regime governing grand-jury practice.

Holder, 678 F.3d 811, 819 (10th Cir.\n2012))).\n       24\n               The United States does not argue that state ethics regulation of federal\nprosecutors practicing before grand juries is expressly preempted. Moreover, it appears\nto concede that Congress has not occupied the field of ethics regulation of federal\nprosecutors practicing before grand juries; in this regard, it has noted that, through the\nMcDade Act, “Congress intended to require federal prosecutors to comply with state\nethical rules and that those rules would apply to grand jury practice.” U.S. Response Br.\nat 44. Notably, as to the latter (i.e., field preemption), we have previously expressed\n“considerable doubt” as to whether “Rules of Professional Conduct . . . apply to federal\nprosecutors’ practice before a federal grand jury.” In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 616\nF.3d 1172, 1186 (10th Cir. 2010). Yet, given the United States’s apparent concession\nregarding the applicability of at least some state ethics rules in the grand-jury context, and\nthe clear conflict between the particular challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) and\nfederal grand-jury law, we need not (and do not) endeavor to reach any definitive,\ncategorical conclusions on whether state ethics rules are excluded from the field of\nfederal prosecutors’ practices before grand juries.\n\n                                             62\n\f       The law of the federal grand jury springs from the fertile and robust soil of the\n\nAnglo-American legal tradition and the Constitution itself. See United States v. Williams,\n\n504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992) (“‘[R]ooted in long centuries of Anglo–American history,’ the\n\ngrand jury is mentioned in the Bill of Rights . . . .” (citation omitted) (quoting Hannah v.\n\nLarche, 363 U.S. 420, 490 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result)); Costello v.\n\nUnited States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956) (“The grand jury is an English institution,\n\nbrought to this country by the early colonists and incorporated in the Constitution by the\n\nFounders. There is every reason to believe that our constitutional grand jury was\n\nintended to operate substantially like its English progenitor.”). And, significantly, this\n\nbody of grand-jury law has a firm and explicit footing in the Constitution’s text through\n\nthe Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Bill of Rights, which “provides that\n\nfederal prosecutions for capital or otherwise infamous crimes must be instituted by\n\npresentments or indictments of grand juries.” Costello, 350 U.S. at 361–62; see U.S.\n\nConst. amend. V (“No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous\n\ncrime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury . . . .”).\n\n       By the Framers’ explicit design, the federal grand jury occupies a uniquely\n\nindependent space in the constitutional text, apart from the three branches of government.\n\nSee Williams, 504 U.S. at 47 (“It [i.e., the grand jury] has not been textually\n\nassigned . . . to any of the branches described in the first three Articles.

See Costello, 350 U.S. at 362 (“The basic purpose of the English grand jury\n\nwas to provide a fair method for instituting criminal proceedings against persons believed\n\nto have committed crimes. . . .

United States, 361 U.S. 212, 218 (1960))).\n\n       As with most express provisions of the Constitution,25 the Framers did not\n\n\n       25\n              In 1819, the Supreme Court made clear that “there is no phrase in the\n[Constitution] which[ ] . . . requires that everything granted shall be expressly and\nminutely described.” M’Culloch v. State, 17 U.S. 316, 406 (1819); see also id. at 406–07\n(“The men who drew and adopted [the Constitution] had experienced the embarrassments\nresulting from the insertion of [certain] word[s] in the articles of confederation, and\nprobably omitted [them], to avoid those embarrassments.”).

Federal\n\ncourts have endeavored, however, to adhere closely to the text and animating purposes of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause in clarifying the scope of the grand jury’s\n\ninvestigative power.26 In this regard, the Supreme Court has recognized that the Framers\n\n\nthe Court elaborated:\n\n                     A constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the\n              subdivisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means\n              by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the\n              prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human\n              mind. It would, probably, never be understood by the public. Its\n              nature, therefore, requires, that only its great outlines should be marked,\n              its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which\n              compose those objects, be deduced from the nature of the objects\n              themselves. That this idea was entertained by the framers of the\n              American constitution, is not only to be inferred from the nature of the\n              instrument, but from the language.\n\nId. at 407; see also Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, --- U.S. ----, 132 S. Ct. 2566,\n2615 (2012) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (observing that the\nFramers “recognized that the Constitution was of necessity a ‘great outlin[e],’ not a\ndetailed blueprint, and that its provisions included broad concepts, to be ‘explained by the\ncontext or by the facts of the case.’” 132 S. Ct. at 2615 (alteration in original) (citations\nomitted)).\n       26\n              Indeed, the federal courts’ grand-jury jurisprudence reflects a careful,\nongoing effort to glean inferences from the text and history of the Constitution’s Grand\nJury Clause regarding the Framer’s conception of the proper scope of the grand jury’s\ninvestigative powers. For example, in Costello, the Court rebuffed a defendant’s\nargument that indictments should be “open to challenge on the ground that there was\ninadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury.” 350 U.S. at 363. The Court\nreasoned that the Fifth Amendment’s vision of the proper functioning of the grand jury\nwould not permit such a rule. In this regard, the court observed:\n\n                     [T]he resulting delay would be great indeed. The result of such\n\n                                              66\n\fenvisioned that the federal grand jury would possess a broad range of discretion; more\n\nspecifically, the Court has held that the grand jury’s function “is to inquire into all\n\ninformation that might possibly bear on its investigation until it has identified an offense\n\nor has satisfied itself that none has occurred.” R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. at 297. In\n\ncarrying out its role in the criminal-justice system, a grand jury “paints with a broad\n\nbrush,” id.; unlike federal courts, it is not bound by Article III’s case or controversy\n\nrequirement or by “the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing the conduct\n\nof criminal trials,” Williams, 504 U.S. at 66–67 (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414\n\nU.S. 338, 343 (1974)); see also Costello, 350 U.S. at 362 (noting that grand juries carry\n\nout their investigative function “free from technical rules”). Thus, while a grand jury may\n\nnot “engage in arbitrary fishing expeditions,” R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. at 299, it has\n\nrelatively broad power to run down available clues and examine all relevant witnesses to\n\ndetermine if there is probable cause to prosecute a particular defendant, see Branzburg v.\n\nHayes, 408 U.S. 665, 701 (1972).\n\n       Of particular importance here is the Supreme Court’s recognition that, in\n\n\n\n              a rule would be that before trial on the merits a defendant could always\n              insist on a kind of preliminary trial to determine the competency and\n              adequacy of the evidence before the grand jury. This is not required by\n              the Fifth Amendment.\n\nId. As Costello illustrates, federal grand-jury law is firmly grounded in the text and\nhistory of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, insofar as Rule\n16-308(E) is determined to be preempted in the grand-jury context—a conclusion that we\nreach infra—the law effectuating that preemption through the Supremacy Clause would\nbe the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n                                              67\n\fperforming its constitutionally sanctioned investigative role, a grand jury may issue\n\nsubpoenas that do not meet the stringent requirements imposed on trial subpoenas.\n\nSpecifically, in United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., the Court held that the standards for\n\ntrial subpoenas announced in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974)—namely,\n\nrelevancy, admissibility, and specificity—do not apply to grand-jury subpoenas. See R.\n\nEnters., Inc., 498 U.S. at 298–99. Instead, where a grand-jury subpoena is challenged on\n\nrelevancy grounds, it will only be quashed if “there is no reasonable possibility that the\n\ncategory of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant to the\n\ngeneral subject of the grand jury’s investigation.” Id. at 301 (emphasis added). The\n\nCourt concluded that the more restrictive Nixon standards “would invite procedural\n\ndelays and detours while courts evaluate[d] the relevancy and admissibility of\n\ndocuments.” Id. at 298; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 906 F.2d 1485, 1496 (10th\n\nCir. 1990) (stating that “the government is not required to make any further showing of\n\nneed or lack of another source for the subpoenaed information”).27\n\n\n       27\n               The Court in R. Enterprises also focused on the possibility that a higher\nrelevance standard would require prosecutors to “explain in too much detail the particular\nreasons underlying a subpoena” and would thus “compromise ‘the indispensable secrecy\nof grand jury proceedings.’” 498 U.S. at 299 (quoting United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S.\n503, 513 (1943)); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) (imposing secrecy requirements on\nparticipants in the grand-jury process). In the context of challenges to the validity of state\nattorney-subpoena rules, some courts—including our own—have taken note of the rules’\npossible impact on grand-jury secrecy. See, e.g., Stern, 214 F.3d at 16 (noting that the\nrule at issue “undermine[d] the secrecy of [grand-jury] proceedings”); see also Colorado\nSupreme Court I, 87 F.3d at 1166 (concluding that the allegation that the Colorado rule\ncompromised grand-jury secrecy was sufficient to meet the injury-in-fact requirement for\npurposes of standing). We acknowledge that grand-jury secrecy may be an important\n\n                                             68\n\f       In light of the Supreme Court’s indication—in construing the mandate of the\n\nGrand Jury Clause—that, for federal grand juries to properly carry out their investigative\n\nrole, there must be no more than minimal limitations placed on the kinds of evidence that\n\nthey can consider, we believe that Rule 16-308(E)’s rigorous standards—i.e., the\n\nrequirements of essentiality and no-other-feasible-alternative—clearly create “an obstacle\n\nto the accomplishment and execution of” the federal grand jury’s constitutionally\n\nauthorized investigative function. Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2501 (quoting Hines, 312 U.S. at\n\n67). To be sure, generally speaking, we do not question the proposition that Congress has\n\nconsiderable leeway to authorize states to regulate the ethical conduct of federal\n\nprosecutors practicing before grand juries. Cf. In re Grand Jury, 111 F.3d 1066, 1073 (3d\n\nCir. 1997) (“Just as grand juries must operate within the confines of the Constitution, so\n\ntoo must they comply with the limitations imposed on them by Congress (as long as those\n\nlimitations are not unconstitutional).” (emphasis added) (citation omitted)). However, we\n\nremain acutely aware of the fact that, by the Framers’ express design, the federal grand\n\njury has an independent constitutional stature and stands apart from all three branches of\n\ngovernment. Consequently, it seems safe to reason that Congress’s power to authorize\n\nstates to burden the grand jury’s investigative functions is not unbounded. At the very\n\n\n\n\nconsideration in determining whether a state ethics rule is preempted. However, because\nRule 16-308(E)’s heightened standards—and the concomitant restriction on evidence\navailable to a grand jury—provide an ample basis for us to conclude that the challenged\nprovisions of Rule 16-308(E) are preempted, we need not definitively opine on the merits\nof this alternative secrecy rationale.\n\n                                            69\n\fleast, we presume that Congress is not free to authorize states to eviscerate the grand jury\n\nand render it nugatory. See Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417, 426 (1885) (“The purpose of\n\nthe [Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth] amendment was to limit the powers of the legislature,\n\nas well as of the prosecuting officers, of the United States. . . . [T]he constitution\n\nprotect[s] every one from being prosecuted, without the intervention of a grand jury, for\n\nany crime which is subject by law to an infamous punishment[;] no declaration of\n\ncongress is needed to secure or competent to defeat the constitutional safeguard.”\n\n(emphases added) (citations omitted)); accord Mackin v. United States, 117 U.S. 348, 351\n\n(1886).\n\n       We do not suggest that Rule 16-308(E)’s rigorous standards tread closely to this\n\ndanger zone or have the foregoing nullifying effect. However, even assuming (without\n\ndeciding) that Congress would be free to authorize states to regulate—through provisions\n\nlike the challenged portions of Rule 16-308(E)—the ethical conduct of federal\n\nprosecutors practicing before grand juries, the significant burdens that such provisions\n\nwould impose on grand juries’ constitutionally authorized investigative functions, compel\n\nus to insist that, if Congress is to so act, that it speak more clearly than it has in the\n\nMcDade Act.28 See Hancock, 426 U.S. at 179 (“Because of the fundamental importance\n\n\n       28\n              Unlike our dissenting colleague, given the unique, independent\nconstitutional stature of the federal grand jury, we believe it would be inappropriate and\nespecially unwise for us to infer from historical events preceding the passage of the\nMcDade Act or the Act’s “general reference to ethics rules,” Dissent at 17, Congress’s\nintent to permit states—through ethical rules—to impose such significant restrictions on\nthe grand jury’s investigative function.

Miller, 486 U.S. 174, 180 (1988) (“It is well\n\nsettled that the activities of federal installations are shielded by the Supremacy Clause\n\nfrom direct state regulation unless Congress provides ‘clear and unambiguous’\n\nauthorization for such regulation.” (emphasis added) (quoting EPA v.

[is] relevant to the general subject of the grand jury’s\n\ninvestigation.” R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. at 301 (emphasis added).

Enterprises); Baylson, 975 F.2d at 109–10 (concluding that substantive\n\nrestraints on grand-jury subpoenas, including a no-other-feasible-alternative requirement,\n\nwere inconsistent with R. Enterprises).\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) impose on\n\nevery federal prosecutor licensed in New Mexico who seeks to issue an attorney\n\nsubpoena in the grand-jury context far more onerous conditions than those required by\n\nfederal law. More specifically, because such heightened requirements for attorney\n\nsubpoenas would impede the grand jury’s broad investigative mandate—which the\n\nFramers specifically envisioned in enacting the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment—the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) conflict with federal law and\n\nare preempted.\n\n                                              D\n\n       Finally, Defendants challenge the scope of the injunction that the district court\n\nissued. We review this question for an abuse of discretion. See ClearOne Commc’ns,\n\nInc. v. Bowers, 643 F.3d 735, 752 (10th Cir. 2011); accord Rocky Mountain Christian\n\n                                              72\n\fChurch v. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs, 613 F.3d 1229, 1239–40 (10th Cir. 2010). That is, we\n\nreverse if the district court’s injunction embodies an “arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or\n\nmanifestly unreasonable judgment.” ClearOne Commc’ns, 643 F.3d at 752 (quoting\n\nRocky Mountain Christian Church, 613 F.3d at 1239–40).\n\n       The district court’s injunction in this case prohibits Defendants “from instituting,\n\nprosecuting, or continuing any disciplinary proceeding or action against any federal\n\nprosecutor for otherwise lawful actions taken in the course of a grand jury investigation or\n\nproceeding on the ground that such attorneys violated Rule 16-308(E) of the New Mexico\n\nRules of Professional Conduct.” Aplts.’ App. at 326–27. Defendants claim that this\n\ninjunction “is much broader than necessary to remedy the alleged conflict” in two\n\nrespects. Aplts.’ Opening Br. at 55.\n\n       First, Defendants argue that the injunction would be better tailored to concerns\n\nabout grand-jury secrecy if it is limited to “particular instance[s]” where a federal\n\nprosecutor is able to make “an adequate showing that the grand jury proceedings [a]re\n\nboth secret and relevant to the disciplinary charges.” Id. at 56. On the basis that we\n\nresolve this case, this argument is unavailing: regardless of whether disciplinary\n\nproceedings would only compromise grand-jury secrecy in certain situations—a\n\nproposition we consider dubious—the essentiality and no-other-feasible-alternative\n\nrequirements conflict overall with federal grand-jury practice because they impose overly\n\nrestrictive standards for the issuance of attorney subpoenas in every instance. Thus, a\n\nbroad injunction is appropriate to remedy such a conflict.\n\n                                             73\n\f       Second, Defendants claim that the injunction would also prohibit the enforcement\n\nof Rule 16-308(E)(1) against a federal prosecutor who knowingly subpoenas a lawyer for\n\nprivileged information. While the district court’s order does refer generally to “Rule 16-\n\n308(E),” see, e.g., Aplts.’ App. at 327, the language of the injunction and the context of\n\nthe order make plain that the enforcement of Rule 16-308(E)(1) is not prohibited. See\n\nAlley v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 590 F.3d 1195, 1208 (11th Cir. 2009)\n\n(“What the plain text of the . . . injunction indicates, the context in which that language\n\nwas written reinforces; much of that context is provided in the opinion issued in tandem\n\nwith the injunction.”); Youakim v. McDonald, 71 F.3d 1274, 1283 (7th Cir. 1995) (“[T]he\n\nterms of an injunction, like any other disputed writing, must be construed in their proper\n\ncontext.”).\n\n       Here, the United States has not challenged the constitutionality of Rule 16-\n\n308(E)(1)’s requirement that prosecutors possess a reasonable belief that information\n\nsought from attorneys by subpoena be non-privileged, and the district court expressly\n\nrecognized that Rule 16-308(E)(1) was not at issue. Furthermore, the injunction is only\n\nlimited to “otherwise lawful actions” taken by prosecutors, Aplts.’ App. at 327, and the\n\nknowing issuance of subpoenas to obtain privileged information is inconsistent with\n\nfederal law, see In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 616 F.3d at 1181–82 (examining whether\n\ninformation sought by subpoena was covered by the attorney-client privilege, which\n\nwould “provide legitimate grounds for refusing to comply with a grand jury subpoena”);\n\nIn re Impounded, 241 F.3d 308, 316 (3d Cir. 2001) (recognizing that “[t]he grand jury\n\n                                             74\n\fmay not ‘itself violate a valid privilege’” and that “courts may quash an otherwise valid\n\ngrand jury subpoena for an attorney’s testimony under the attorney-client privilege”\n\n(quoting Calandra, 414 U.S. at 346)). The injunction should, therefore, reasonably be\n\nread as permitting the enforcement of Rule 16-308(E)(1) where a prosecutor engages in\n\nunlawful action by issuing a subpoena to an attorney without a reasonable belief that the\n\ninformation sought is not privileged.\n\n       Thus, read in light of “the relief sought by the moving party . . . and the mischief\n\nthat the injunction seeks to prevent,” United States v. Christie Indus., Inc., 465 F.2d 1002,\n\n1007 (3d Cir. 1972), we conclude that the district court’s injunction did not evince an\n\nabuse of discretion because it only bars enforcement of the unconstitutional aspects of\n\nRule 16-308(E)—namely, all applications of subsections (2) and (3) in the grand-jury\n\ncontext—and does not enjoin the enforcement of subsection (1).\n\n                                              III\n\n       In sum, we hold that (1) the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction because\n\nthe United States had standing and the claim was ripe for review; (2) because the United\n\nStates’s preemption claim is a legal one, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying discovery; (3) the district court correctly concluded that (a) under our decision in\n\nColorado Supreme Court II, the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) are not\n\npreempted outside of the grand-jury context, but (b) they are preempted in the grand-jury\n\nsetting because they conflict with the federal-law principles—embodied in the Grand Jury\n\nClause of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court—that govern federal\n\n                                              75\n\fprosecutors’ attorney-subpoena practices before grand juries, and thereby stand as an\n\nobstacle to the effectuation of the grand jury’s constitutionally authorized investigative\n\nfunctions; and (4) the district court’s injunction appropriately prohibits the enforcement\n\nof Rule 16-308(E)(2) and (3) against federal prosecutors practicing before grand juries,\n\nwhile permitting the enforcement of Rule 16-308(E)(1). We AFFIRM the district court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                             76\n\f14-2037, 14-2049, United States v. Supreme Court of New Mexico et al.\n\nTYMKOVICH, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n      The United States claims it is immunized from following New Mexico’s\n\nRule of Professional Conduct 16-308(E), 1 which establishes professional\n\nguidelines for prosecutors issuing subpoenas to third-party lawyers in criminal\n\ncases. The majority agrees, and finds that to apply the rule to federal prosecutors\n\nwould violate the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause because New Mexico’s rule\n\nconflicts with federal law governing grand-jury practice and procedure.\n\n      But this Supremacy Clause challenge must fail if Congress has authorized\n\nthe application of this rule—and it has. In 1998, Congress enacted the McDade\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Rule 16-308(E) provides,\n\n      The prosecutor in a criminal case shall: . . .\n\n              E.    not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other\n                    criminal proceeding to present evidence about a past\n                    or present client unless the prosecutor reasonable\n                    believes:\n\n                    (1)   the information sought is not protected\n                          from disclosure by an applicable\n                          privilege;\n\n                    (2)   the evidence sought is essential to the\n                          successful completion of an ongoing\n                          investigation or prosecution;\n\n                    (3)   there is no other feasible alternative to\n                          obtain the information . . . .\n\fAmendment, 28 U.S.C. § 530B, 2 instructing federal prosecutors that they “shall be\n\nsubject” to state rules of ethics “governing attorneys in each State where [they]\n\nengage in [their] duties, to the same extent and in the same manner as other\n\nattorneys in that State.” And in United States v. Colorado Supreme Court\n\n(Colorado Supreme Court II), 189 F.3d 1281, 1284 (10th Cir. 1999), we\n\nestablished a method for determining whether a state rule falls within the scope of\n\nthe McDade Amendment and held that a Colorado rule (identical to New\n\nMexico’s rule), requiring compliance with state trial subpoena rules, applied to\n\nfederal prosecutors. That should end the matter.\n\n      The majority, however, holds Rule 16-308(E) does not apply to federal\n\nprosecutors because it unduly burdens federal interests when applied in the grand\n\n\n\n      2\n          In full, the Amendment reads,\n\n      § 530B. Ethical standards for attorneys for the Government\n\n      (a) An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws and\n      rules, and local Federal court rules, governing attorneys in each State\n      where such attorney engages in that attorney’s duties, to the same\n      extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that State.\n\n      (b) The Attorney General shall make and amend rules of the Department\n      of Justice to assure compliance with this section.\n\n      (c) As used in this section, the term “attorney for the Government”\n      includes any attorney described in section 77.2(a) of part 77 of title 28\n      of the Code of Federal Regulations and also includes any independent\n      counsel, or employee of such a counsel, appointed under chapter 40.\n\n\n                                          2\n\fjury context. Thus, despite categorizing the rule as one governing “ethics,” which\n\nCongress clearly intended to apply to federal prosecutors, the majority reads\n\nColorado Supreme Court II to also require a conflict preemption analysis.\n\nApplying the obstacle-conflict preemption doctrine, the majority holds New\n\nMexico’s rule is preempted in the grand jury context because it places more\n\nonerous conditions on federal prosecutors issuing subpoenas than required by the\n\nSupreme Court in United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 292 (1991). The\n\nmajority grounds its preemption analysis not in any congressional\n\nmandate—because, indeed, Congress expressly stated federal prosecutors “shall\n\nbe subject” to state ethics rules—but in the Constitution’s text by way of the Fifth\n\nAmendment’s Grand Jury Clause. But New Mexico’s rule is not inconsistent with\n\nthe Grand Jury Clause’s guarantee that “[n]o person shall be held to answer for a\n\ncapital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless in a presentment or indictment of a\n\nGrand Jury.” Instead, the rule merely instructs prosecutors practicing in New\n\nMexico (federal or state alike) of their professional duty when issuing subpoenas\n\nto third-party lawyers in criminal cases.\n\n      As I see it, the first and only question we must answer is: whether the rule\n\nis one governing ethics? If it is, considering its burden on federal interests is\n\nunnecessary because Congress has authorized the rule’s application to federal\n\nprosecutors. And because Colorado Supreme Court II classified an identical rule\n\nas an ethics rule, the answer is straightfoward. Since the majority’s holding\n\n                                            3\n\fdeparts from Congress’s clear intent to apply all state ethics rules to federal\n\nprosecutors, I respectfully dissent. 3\n\n                                    I. Discussion\n\n      A. The McDade Amendment\n\n      I begin with the statutory background on which we all agree. No one\n\ndisputes that “state regulation” of “federal . . . activities” can be authorized by a\n\n“clear congressional mandate” making that “authorization of state regulation clear\n\nand unambiguous.” Hancock v. Train, 426 U.S. 167, 179 (1976). The United\n\nStates, of course, acknowledges there is no Supremacy Clause problem if federal\n\nlaw unambiguously authorizes the application of the state rules at issue here. See\n\nSecond Br. at 38 (“[I]f Congress has, through the McDade Act, clearly and\n\nunambiguously authorized the application to federal prosecutors of [the rule],\n\nNew Mexico has not violated the Supremacy Clause.”). And the Amendment’s\n\ntext is clear: “An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws and\n\nrules . . . governing attorneys in each State where such attorney engages in that\n\nattorney’s duties, to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in\n\nthat State.” § 530B(a); Colo. Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284 (noting state\n\nlaws and rules contemplated by the Amendment are “state professional rules” or\n\n\n\n      3\n         I concur with the majority’s conclusions on standing and ripeness. My\nanalysis is the same no matter whether we look at the challenge facially or as-\napplied.\n\n                                          4\n\f“rule[s] of professional ethics”).\n\n      Indisputably, then, if a state rule is an ethics rule, the McDade Amendment\n\nclearly and unambiguously authorizes its application to federal prosecutors. No\n\none doubts this is an ethics rule in at least one context. In Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt II, we created a test for determining whether a rule is an ethics rule and\n\napplied the test to hold an identical rule as ethical in all non-grand-jury criminal\n\nproceedings. 4 189 F.3d at 1284, 1288. The question in that case was whether a\n\nColorado rule identical to New Mexico’s violated the Supremacy Clause as\n\napplied in “criminal proceedings other than a grand jury.” Id. at 1284. As the\n\nmajority notes, that question turned on whether the rule was “‘a rule of\n\nprofessional ethics clearly covered by the McDade Act, or a substantive or\n\nprocedural rule that is inconsistent with federal law.’” Majority Op. 5, 55\n\n(quoting Colo. Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284).\n\n      We first noted the definition of “ethical”: “‘[o]f or relating to moral action,\n\n\n\n      4\n         Colorado Supreme Court II was the second time we had addressed the\nUnited States’s Supremacy Clause challenge to this Colorado rule. We previously\nreversed and remanded the district court’s dismissal for lack of standing when we\nfirst considered that case. See United States v. Colo. Supreme Court (Colorado\nSupreme Court I), 87 F.3d 1161, 1166–67 (10th Cir. 1996). When we addressed\nthe rule in Colorado Supreme Court I, it contained a requirement precluding the\nissuance of a third-party subpoena unless the attorney “obtain[ed] prior judicial\napproval after the opportunity for an adversarial proceeding.” Id. at 1163. By the\ntime of Colorado Supreme Court II, that requirement had been removed, leaving\nus with a rule governing third-party subpoenas indistinguishable from New\nMexico’s. See Colo. Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284.\n\n                                           5\n\fconduct, motive or character. . . . Professionally right or befitting; conforming to\n\nprofessional standards of conduct.’” Colo. Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284\n\n(quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 553 (6th ed. 1990)); see also id. at 1285\n\n(quoting In re Snyder, 472 U.S. 634, 645 (1985)) (noting the Supreme Court’s\n\ndefinition of unethical conduct as “conduct contrary to professional standards that\n\nshows an unfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or the courts, or\n\nconduct inimical to the administration of justice”). In short, the question was\n\nwhether Colorado’s rule was “one of those normative legal standards that guides\n\nthe conduct of an attorney.” Id.\n\n      To answer that question, we outlined a three-prong test. 5 “First,” an ethical\n\nrule bars “conduct recognized by consensus within the profession as\n\ninappropriate.” Id. at 1287. “Second,” such rules are like “commandment[s]\n\ndealing with morals and principles” and in “directing sweeping commandments of\n\nconduct” can be “quite vague” in nature, in contrast to procedural or substantive\n\nlaw, “the purposes of which are to direct a cause of action through the courts.”\n\nId. “Finally,” such rules are “directed at the attorney herself.” Id. “Applying\n\n[those] factors” to Colorado’s rule, we “easily conclud[ed] the rule [was] an\n\n\n\n      5\n         Notably, this means a rule is not applicable to federal prosecutors just\nbecause a state enacts rules of professional responsibility; the state rule must still\npass our three-prong test. In other words, the McDade Amendment does not give\nstates carte blanche to regulate federal prosecutors under the guise of ethical\nregulation.\n\n                                          6\n\fethical one.” Id. at 1288.\n\n      But the majority relies on a brief aside at the end of the opinion, made after\n\nwe applied our test and concluded the rule was an ethics rule, that Colorado’s rule\n\nalso “does not conflict with” a particular federal rule of criminal procedure and,\n\n“[a]ccordingly, . . . is not inconsistent with federal law.” Id at 1288–89. That\n\nstatement, however, is merely an affirmation of the truism that it is not\n\ninconsistent with federal law to apply state ethics rules as federal law instructs.\n\n      A natural reading of the opinion and a reasonable understanding of the\n\nword “ethical” supports that position. We plainly thought what mattered was the\n\nmeaning of the word ethical, and every factor we announced goes to the essence\n\nof that word. The Amendment speaks of “Ethical standards,” § 530B, and we\n\ngenerally interpret words in a statute “as taking their ordinary, contemporary,\n\ncommon meaning.” Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 603 (2010). And a rule\n\ngoverning ethics, by our own definition, is neither a substantive nor procedural\n\nrule. Thus, the McDade Amendment suffices to ensure that rules of truly ethical\n\nconcern fit unobtrusively into the federal scheme, because it explicitly deems\n\nsuch rules applicable to federal prosecutors.\n\n      And I cannot see how New Mexico’s rule is any less a “normative legal\n\nstandard[]” guiding “the conduct of an attorney,” Colo. Supreme Court II, 189\n\nF.3d at 1285, than the identical rule we considered in Colorado Supreme Court II\n\nbecause it might affect federal prosecutors in grand-jury practice. It, no less,\n\n                                           7\n\f“bar[s] conduct recognized by consensus within the profession as inappropriate.”\n\nId. at 1287. It deals with the same “morals and principles” as that rule, and, like\n\nthat rule, it is “directed at the attorney herself.” Id. Because we are bound by\n\nColorado Supreme Court II, there is no Supremacy Clause violation here. 6\n\n      The foregoing analysis of the McDade Amendment’s plain language and\n\nour decision in Colorado Supreme Court II demonstrates the infirmity of the\n\nSupremacy Clause argument. But understanding the problem Congress wished to\n\nfix by passing the McDade Amendment operates to underscore the inapplicability\n\nof an additional independent preemption analysis.\n\n      In 1989, the Department of Justice issued the “Thornburgh Memorandum,”\n\nwhich concluded that “although the states have the authority to regulate the\n\nethical conduct of attorneys admitted to practice” in their courts, federal\n\nprosecutors may only be regulated in that manner “if the regulation does not\n\nconflict with the federal law or with the attorneys’ federal responsibilities.”\n\nBruce A. Green, Whose Rules of Professional Conduct Should Govern Lawyers in\n\nFederal Court and How Should the Rules Be Created?, 64 Geo. Wash. L. Rev.\n\n\n      6\n         The United States also challenges the application of New Mexico’s rule\noutside the grand jury context. But as the majority explains, this challenge “is\nprimarily form, not substance.” Majority Op. 12. I agree with the majority that\nour review is confined by our prior conclusions in Colorado Supreme Court II,\nMajority Op. 60, absent direction from the Supreme Court or the en banc panel. I\nalso note the Supreme Court has not had the opportunity to construe whether our\ndelineation between rules that are ethical and those that are substantive or\nprocedural is a correct one.\n\n                                          8\n\f460, 471 (1996) (quoting Memorandum from Dick Thornburgh, Attorney General,\n\nU.S. Department of Justice, to All Justice Department Litigators (June 8, 1989)).\n\nThe DOJ intended to insulate federal prosecutors in at least some circumstances\n\nfrom compliance with state ethics rules modeled upon ABA Model Rule 4.2,\n\nwhich prohibited ex-parte attorney contacts with a represented party. N.Y. State\n\nBar Ass’n v. FTC, 276 F. Supp. 2d 110, 132 (D.D.C. 2003).\n\n      The memorandum received substantial criticism. See id.; In re Doe, 801 F.\n\nSupp. 478, 487 (D.N.M. 1992); see also United States v. Tapp, No. CR107-108,\n\n2008 WL 2371422, at *6 (S.D. Ga. June 4, 2008) (noting criticism from “the\n\nABA, the state bar associations, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the\n\nConference of State Chief Justices, [and] the Federal Bar Association”).\n\nNevertheless, in 1994, the DOJ promulgated a regulation dubbed the Reno\n\nRegulation, which essentially codified the Thornburgh Memorandum. See N.Y.\n\nState Bar Ass’n, 276 F. Supp. 2d at 132; see also John H. Lim, The Side Effects of\n\na Legal Ethics Panacea: Revealing a United States’s Standing Committee’s\n\nProposal to “Standardize” Ethics Rules in the Federal Courts as an Attempt to\n\nUndermine the No-Contact Rule, 13 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 547, 568 (2000) (“[T]he\n\nReno [Regulation was] a virtual reprise of the Thornburgh Memo.”).\n\n      The Eighth Circuit invalidated portions of the Reno Regulation as beyond\n\nthe DOJ’s statutory authority, see United States ex rel. O’Keefe v. McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp., 132 F.3d 1252, 1257 (8th Cir. 1998), and criticism of the DOJ’s\n\n                                         9\n\fattempt to insulate itself from state rules of professional responsibility persisted.\n\nLitigation continued on the subject. See, e.g., Colo. Supreme Court I, 87 F.3d at\n\n1163 (noting challenge by the United States in 1996 to application of certain\n\nColorado ethics rules to federal prosecutors); Stern v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of\n\nMass., 214 F.3d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting same type of challenge to application\n\nof Massachusetts ethics rules to federal prosecutors).\n\n      Thus, in 1998, it was unclear whether or to what extent the DOJ could\n\nexempt its attorneys from complying with a given state’s rules. Note, Federal\n\nProsecutors, State Ethics Regulations, and the McDade Amendment, 113 Harv. L.\n\nRev. 2080, 2088 (2000) (“By 1998, the war over ethics regulations had reached a\n\nstalemate.”). Congress clarified that uncertainty with the McDade Amendment.\n\nSee N.Y. State Bar Ass’n, 276 F. Supp. 2d at 133 (“[I]n the face of the Justice\n\nDepartment’s repeated attempts to exclude its attorneys from compliance with\n\nstate bar rules, Congress adopted the [McDade Amendment] . . . .”). The method\n\nCongress chose lacked any of the exemption-granting language present in the\n\ncontroversial Thornburgh Memorandum and Reno Regulation. And we should not\n\ntake Congress’s failure to include those exemptions as reason to read those\n\nexemptions into the plain meaning of a word—ethical—that does not naturally\n\nencompass them. The simpler reading is that Congress was aware of the debate\n\nand came down on the side of a blanket authorization of any rule deemed to\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fgovern attorney ethics. 7 See Federal Prosecutors, State Ethics Regulations, and\n\nthe McDade Amendment, supra, at 2088 (“[U]nlike prior DOJ guidelines, [the\n\nMcDade Amendment] affords no exceptions for federal prosecutors when state\n\nethics rules impinge on federal law enforcement interests.”). That is the reading\n\nwe adopted in Colorado Supreme Court II. 8\n\n      Of course, Congress did not intend to allow states to regulate government\n\nattorneys in a manner inconsistent with federal law. But after the McDade\n\nAmendment, regulation of federal prosecutors via rules that are truly ethical in\n\n\n      7\n          It is unsurprising that Congress chose such a broadly sweeping method in\nlight of the long tradition of states “exercis[ing] extensive control over the\nprofessional conduct of attorneys.” Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden\nState Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423, 434 (1982) (noting “special importance” of the\n“State’s interest in the professional conduct of attorneys involved in the\nadministration of criminal justice”); Fla. Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618,\n635 (1995) (noting “the standards and conduct of state-licensed lawyers have\ntraditionally been subject to extensive regulation by the States”).\n      8\n         See Colo. Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284 (outlining the operative\nquestion as “whether Rule 3.8 violates the Supremacy Clause now turns on\nwhether the rule is a rule of professional ethics clearly covered by the McDade\nAct, or a substantive or procedural rule that is inconsistent with federal law”\n(emphasis added)). Other commentators agree. Sara S. Beale, et al., Grand Jury\nLaw & Prac. § 6:24 (2d ed.) (“[T]he question whether Rule 3.8(e) may be applied\nto federal prosecutors may turn on whether it is treated as a procedural rule or an\nethical rule. . . . The Tenth Circuit held that the modified version of Rule 3.8(e)\nadopted in Colorado is an ethical rule rather than a procedural rule and therefore\nwas applicable to federal prosecutors under the McDade Act.” (emphasis added)\n(footnotes omitted)); 2 Charles Alan Wright, et al., Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. §\n276 (4th ed.) (citing Colorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1288 and stating “if\nsuch local rule is characterized as an ethics provision rather than a substantive or\nprocedural rule, it may by imposed upon federal prosecutors consistent with the\nSupremacy Clause.” (emphasis added)).\n\n                                         11\n\fnature is expressly authorized by, and therefore consistent with, the dictates of\n\nfederal law. It would be perverse to say states act in a manner inconsistent with\n\nfederal law when they act as federal law instructs. Whether the Amendment’s\n\nauthorization of such regulation in these circumstances is a wise policy choice is\n\nnot a question this court can or should answer.\n\n      B. Grand-Jury Practice and Procedure as Preemptive\n\n      In proceeding with its preemption analysis, the majority rests its\n\npreemption finding on the role grand-jury practice and procedure plays in the\n\nfederal legal system—particularly, that New Mexico’s rule imposes more onerous\n\nconditions on federal prosecutors issuing subpoenas to third-party lawyers in a\n\ngrand jury context than required by the Supreme Court in United States v. R.\n\nEnterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 292 (1991). Majority Op. 61–71. So to adhere to the\n\nSupremacy Clause’s dictate that only three named sources of federal law enjoy\n\nsupremacy (“This Constitution,” “the Laws of the United States,” and “all\n\nTreaties,” Const. art. VI, cl. 2) the majority reasons the grand-jury subpoena\n\nstandard must be traced to the constitutional significance of grand juries as\n\nrecognized in the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause. 9\n\n\n      9\n         The majority also concludes New Mexico’s rule stands as an obstacle to\nthe important investigative function of grand juries. But New Mexico’s rule (as a\nrule of ethics) is not directed at the grand jury as an institution. It is directed\nonly at prosecutors. Simply because the prevailing practice is for prosecutors to\nissue subpoenas on behalf of grand juries, Sara S. Beale, et al., Grand Jury Law &\nPrac. § 6:2 (2d ed.), is insufficient to conclude the rule violates the Supremacy\n\n                                         12\n\f      As an initial matter, I note the peculiar circumstances that this case\n\npresents. Our conflict preemption analysis requires us to compare a state statute\n\nto its federal counterpart and evaluate whether (1) “compliance with both federal\n\nand state regulations is a physical impossibility,” or (2) “the challenged state law\n\nstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes\n\nand objectives of Congress.” Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2501\n\n(2012) (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But as\n\nthe majority presents it here, we are deciding whether New Mexico’s\n\nrule—which, as a rule of ethics, Congress has authorized its application by\n\nenacting the McDade Amendment—stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\n\nand execution of the federal grand-jury subpoena standard as announced by\n\njudicial decision. Majority Op. 66–67 (discussing grand-jury subpoena standard\n\nannounced in R. Enterprises). Thus, the federal interest here is one of judicial\n\nmaking, and Congress has seen fit to expressly authorize the conflict.\n\n      The majority relies heavily on the Grand Jury Clause to ground its\n\npreemption analysis in some constitutional text. Although there was no mention\n\nof grand juries in the original Constitution, the Fifth Amendment reads, “No\n\nperson shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless\n\non a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.” This guarantee “confer[s] a\n\n\n\n\nClause as being inconsistent with the protections of the Grand Jury Clause.\n\n                                         13\n\fright not to be tried (in the pertinent sense) when there is no grand jury\n\nindictment.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 802 (1989);\n\nsee also Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417, 426 (1885) (“The purpose of the [Grand\n\nJury Clause] was to limit the powers of the legislature, as well as of the\n\nprosecuting officers, of the United States. . . . [T]he constitution protect[s] every\n\none from being prosecuted, without the intervention of a grand jury, for any crime\n\nwhich is subject by law to an infamous punishment.”). The Supreme Court,\n\nhowever, has limited the Grand Jury Clause’s reach by, for one, not compelling\n\nits application to the states through the Due Process Clause. See generally\n\nHurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); see also Jerold H. Israel, Free-\n\nStanding Due Process and Criminal Procedure: The Supreme Court’s Search for\n\nInterpretive Guidelines, 45 St. Louis U. L.J. 303, 385 (2001) (“Of the specific\n\nguarantees aimed at the criminal justice process, only the Fifth Amendment\n\nrequirement of prosecution by indictment or presentment quite clearly will not be\n\nincorporated [into the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process guarantees].”).\n\n      The majority’s conclusion that the standard adopted in R. Enterprises is\n\nmandated by the Grand Jury Clause (thus, taking on constitutional supremacy)\n\nreads too much into the Supreme Court’s decision. The Court clearly defined its\n\ntask: “[T]he focus of our inquiry is the limit imposed on a grand jury by Federal\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 17(c).” R. Enters., 498 U.S. at 299 (“‘[Rule 17(c)]\n\nprovides that the court on motion made promptly may quash or modify the\n\n                                          14\n\fsubpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.’”). Because\n\n“reasonable[ness] depends on the context,” id., “[t]o the extent that Rule 17(c)\n\nimposes some reasonableness limitation on grand jury subpoenas . . . [the\n\nCourt’s] task is to define it.” Id. at 300. The Court then rejected the Nixon\n\nstandard, applying to trial subpoenas, and adopted the following standard:\n\n“[W]here . . . a subpoena is challenged on relevancy grounds, the motion to quash\n\nmust be denied unless the district court determines that there is no reasonable\n\npossibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce\n\ninformation relevant to the general subject of the grand jury’s investigation.” Id.\n\nat 301. That this standard is of constitutional significance—as opposed to federal\n\ngrand juries generally—goes too far. 10\n\n      Having concluded the invocation of the Grand Jury Clause is illusory, I\n\nreturn to the majority’s preemption finding. Although the Supreme Court has\n\napproved of the doctrine of obstacle preemption (or frustration-of-purpose\n\n      10\n         And it is generally understood that Congress controls the Supreme\nCourt’s rulemaking authority to promulgate rules of federal criminal procedure.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2072(a). Indeed, Congress has regulated grand-jury practice and\nprocedure through amendments to the federal rules. From 2001 to 2004, Congress\nexpanded the disclosure provisions in Rule 6(e) three times. See USA PATRIOT\nAct, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272, 279–80 (2001); Homeland Security Act of\n2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, 2256–57 (2002); Intelligence Reform and\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-458, 118 Stat. 3638, 3760 (2004).\nOf course, this discussion only has significance if New Mexico’s rule is deemed\nto be “procedural” in form—that is, it is a rule of procedure infringing upon the\nfederal rules. But, as the majority concedes, that is not the case here. Following\nColorado Supreme Court II’s framework, New Mexico’s rule is clearly one\ngoverning ethics.\n\n                                          15\n\fpreemption), see Crosby v. Nat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 373\n\n(2000), the doctrine has been heavily criticized, see generally Caleb Nelson,\n\nPreemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225 (2000), and the Court has been sensitive to its\n\nover application. The Court has directed that in obstacle preemption cases,\n\n“There is no federal pre-emption in vacuo, without a constitutional text or a\n\nfederal statute to assert it.” Puerto Rico Dep’t of Consumer Affairs v. Isla\n\nPetroleum Corp., 485 U.S. 495, 503 (1988). 11\n\n      Notwithstanding the Court’s sensitivity and criticism to the doctrine, see\n\nalso Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 123 (2002), the Court has\n\ncontinued to apply it to invalidate state laws that stand as obstacles to the purpose\n\nof a particular federal statutory scheme, see Richard H. Fallon, Jr. et al., Hart and\n\nWechsler’s The Federal Courts and The Federal System 648 (6th ed. 2009) (citing\n\nDaniel J. Meltzer, The Supreme Court’s Judicial Passivity, 2002 Sup. Ct. Rev.\n\n343 (2002)). Thus, in such cases, the Court generally departs from traditional\n\n\n      11\n          Justice Thomas, in no less than four recent opinions, has questioned the\nconstitutional lineage of the doctrine. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 604\n(2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2524\n(Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Williamson v. Mazda\nMotor of Am., 562 U.S. 323, 340 (2011) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment);\nHaywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729 767 (2009) (Thomas, J., dissenting). In Justice\nThomas’s words, obstacle preemption “is inconsistent with the Constitution\nbecause it invites courts to engage in freewheeling speculation about\ncongressional purpose that roams well beyond statutory text. . . . Under the\nSupremacy Clause, pre-emptive effect is to be given to congressionally enacted\nlaws, not to judicially divined legislative purposes.” Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2524\n(citation omitted).\n\n                                         16\n\fcanons of statutory interpretation by looking past the plain language of the statute\n\nand focusing on legislative intent to divine the full purpose and objectives of\n\nCongress. See Cal. Div. of Labor Standards Enf’t v. Dillingham Constr., N.A.,\n\n519 U.S. 316, 335–36 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring); Geier v. Am. Honda Motor\n\nCo., 529 U.S. 861, 868, 870 (2000) (quoting United States v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89,\n\n106 (2000)). But still, the purposes and objectives are those of Congress, not the\n\ncourts. Cf. Atherton v. FDIC, 519 U.S. 213, 218 (1997) (“‘Whether latent federal\n\npower should be exercised to displace state law is primarily a decision for\n\nCongress,’ not the federal courts.” (quoting Wallis v. Pan Am. Petroleum Corp.,\n\n384 U.S. 63, 68 (1966)).\n\n      With that, I fully recognize the grand jury’s special position. See, e.g., R.\n\nEnters., 498 U.S. at 297 (noting grand jury’s “unique role in our criminal justice\n\nsystem”). But the grand jury’s unique role does not mean federal grand juries are\n\nimmune from congressional regulation absent some constitutional directive\n\nstating otherwise. Majority Op. 68 (citing In re Grand Jury, 111 F.3d 1066, 1073\n\n(3d Cir. 1997) (“Just as grand juries must operate within the confines of the\n\nConstitution, so too must they comply with the limitations imposed on them by\n\nCongress (as long as those limitations are not unconstitutional).”). Regulation of\n\ngrand juries via a federal statute, of course, is precisely that. The majority does\n\nnot hold that Congress lacks the power to say federal prosecutors in the grand\n\njury context are bound by standards mirroring New Mexico’s. That it did so more\n\n                                          17\n\findirectly—but still expressly, by a general reference to ethics rules—makes no\n\ndifference. In short, the question of whether the McDade Amendment authorizes\n\na rule’s application as ethical in no way depends on whether that rule’s\n\napplication to federal prosecutors may have the effect of changing their conduct.\n\nTo the contrary, Colorado Supreme Court II and the statute’s plain meaning make\n\nclear that any obstacle created by state law here exists pursuant to Congress’s\n\nexpress intent. 12\n\n                                II. Conclusion\n\n       In sum, without some indication that Rule 16-308(E) stands as an obstacle\n\nto the accomplishment and execution of Congress’s purposes and objectives, I\n\nrespectfully dissent from the majority’s determination that the rule conflicts with\n\nfederal interests and is thus preempted.\n\n\n\n\n       12\n          I note that one judge has concluded in a separate opinion that an Illinois\nrule identical to the one here would apply to federal prosecutors by virtue of the\nMcDade Amendment, citing Colorado Supreme Court II for support. See United\nStates v. Williams, 698 F.3d 374, 391–92 (7th Cir. 2012) (Hamilton, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). See also United States ex rel. U.S.\nAttorneys for the E. & W. Dists. of Ky. v. Ky. Bar Ass’n, 439 S.W.3d 136, 146\n(Ky. 2014) (“In our view, E–435 survives scrutiny under [the McDade\nAmendment] and the Supremacy Clause because it is simply an ethical rule and\ndoes not affect federal substantive, procedural, or evidentiary law.” (footnote\nomitted)).\n\n                                           18\n\f",

U.S. Const., art. VI, § 2. The district\n\ncourt concluded, on cross-motions for summary judgment, that Rule 16-308(E) is\n\npreempted with respect to federal prosecutors practicing before grand juries, but is not\n\npreempted outside of the grand-jury context. We agree. Exercising jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                              I\n\n                                              A\n\n       The roots of Rule 16-308(E) can be traced to the adoption by the American Bar\n\nAssociation (“ABA”) of Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(e) (“Model Rule\n\n3.8(e)”). Faced with what was perceived to be an “increasing incidence of grand jury and\n\ntrial subpoenas directed toward attorneys defending criminal cases,” ABA Crim. Justice\n\nSection, Report with Recommendation to the ABA House of Delegates No. 122B, at 2\n\n(Feb. 1988), the ABA issued Model Rule 3.8(e)1 in 1990 “to limit the issuance of lawyer\n\nsubpoenas in grand jury and other criminal proceedings to those situations in which there\n\nis a genuine need to intrude into the client-lawyer relationship,” Model Rules of Prof’l\n\nConduct r. 3.8(e) cmt. 4 (Am. Bar Ass’n 2015). As adopted, Model Rule 3.8(e) stated:\n\n              The prosecutor in a criminal case shall: . . .\n\n              ([e]) not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding\n              to present evidence about a past or present client unless:\n\n                     (1)    the prosecutor reasonably believes:\n\n                            (a)     the information sought is not protected from\n                                    disclosure by an applicable privilege;\n\n                            (b)     the evidence sought is essential to the successful\n                                    completion of an ongoing investigation or\n                                    prosecution;\n\n\n\n       1\n             Originally adopted as Model Rule 3.8(f), the rule was re-designated as\nModel Rule 3.8(e) in 2002. We refer to it throughout this opinion as Model Rule 3.8(e) to\navoid any possible confusion.\n\n                                                  3\n\f                            (c)    there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the\n                                   information; and\n\n                     (2)    the prosecutor obtains prior judicial approval after an\n                            opportunity for an adversarial proceeding.\n\nABA Standing Comm. on Ethics & Prof’l Responsibility, Report with Recommendation\n\nto the ABA House of Delegates No. 118, at 1 (Feb. 1990). The rule, as originally\n\nadopted, thus consisted of two components. Subsection (e)(1) governed prosecutors’\n\nreasonable belief about the content of the information sought—i.e., that it was not\n\nprivileged, was essential, and could not be obtained from any other feasible alternative.\n\nSubsection (e)(2) imposed a judicial preapproval requirement before a prosecutor could\n\nobtain an attorney subpoena.\n\n       Several states promulgated versions of Model Rule 3.8(e), and legal challenges to\n\nthese rules produced conflicting outcomes. The Third Circuit, for example, concluded\n\nthat the judicial preapproval requirement in Pennsylvania’s version of Model Rule 3.8(e)\n\nconflicted with federal rules governing the issuance of subpoenas, and held that the\n\nenforcement of the rule against federal prosecutors was preempted. See Baylson v.\n\nDisciplinary Bd. of Supreme Court of Pa., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590906\"><a href=\"/opinion/590906/michael-m-baylson-james-j-west-thomas-w-corbett-jr-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111–12 (3d Cir. 1992). In\n\ncontrast, the First Circuit found that Rhode Island’s version of the rule created “no\n\nconflict with the Supremacy Clause.” Whitehouse v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of R.I., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695496\"><a href=\"/opinion/695496/sheldon-whitehouse-in-his-official-capacity-as-united-states-attorney-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1365 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n       Before our court, the United States challenged Colorado’s adoption of Model Rule\n\n3.8(e). Specifically, we were called upon to review the district court’s dismissal of the\n\n                                             4\n\fUnited States’s action on jurisdictional grounds—that is, “[t]he district court dismissed\n\nthe complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, stating that the United States did not\n\nhave standing because it did not allege that federal prosecutors had suffered any actual or\n\nimminent injury from application of the rules.” United States v. Colo. Supreme Court\n\n(“Colorado Supreme Court I”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720715\"><a href=\"/opinion/720715/united-states-v-colorado-supreme-court-grievance-committee-of-the-supreme/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1163 (10th Cir. 1996). We reversed,\n\nhowever, concluding that, even though no federal prosecutor had been sanctioned under\n\nColorado’s rule, the potential that it would “interfere with federal prosecutors in their\n\nconduct of criminal proceedings and change the nature of the federal grand jury in\n\nColorado” was a sufficient injury in fact to render the case justiciable. Id. at 1165.\n\n       The case later returned to us after the district court ruled on the merits of the\n\nUnited States’s challenge. See United States v. Colo. Supreme Court (“Colorado\n\nSupreme Court II”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158581\"><a href=\"/opinion/158581/united-states-v-colorado-supreme/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1999). In the interim, the legal landscape\n\nhad been altered in two salient ways. First, following the ABA’s lead,2 the Colorado\n\nSupreme Court amended its Rule 3.8(e) in 1997 by removing the judicial preapproval\n\nrequirement.3 Id. at 1284. Second, in 1998, Congress stepped in and enacted the\n\n       2\n               In 1995, the ABA amended Model Rule 3.8(e) to remove the judicial\npreapproval requirement. See Stern v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Dist. of Mass., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768899\"><a href=\"/opinion/768899/donald-k-stern-v-united-states-district-court-for-the-district-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n9 (1st Cir. 2000).\n       3\n             Thus, by the time of Colorado Supreme Court II, Colorado Rule\n3.8(e)—and the ABA’s Model Rule 3.8(e) on which it was based—only contained the\nreasonable-belief requirement. It provided:\n\n              The prosecutor in a criminal case shall: . . .\n\n              (e)    not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal\n\n                                              5\n\fMcDade Act, 28 U.S.C. § 530B, which requires that:\n\n              (a)    An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws\n                     and rules, and local Federal court rules, governing attorneys in\n                     each State where such attorney engages in that attorney’s duties,\n                     to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in\n                     that State.\n\n              (b)    The Attorney General shall make and amend rules of the\n                     Department of Justice to assure compliance with this section.\n\nThe Attorney General then promulgated regulations, pursuant to § 530B(b), stating that\n\nthe statute “should not be construed in any way to alter federal substantive, procedural, or\n\nevidentiary law.” 28 C.F.R. § 77.1(b).\n\n       As we framed it in Colorado Supreme Court II, the “question whether Rule 3.8\n\nviolate[d] the Supremacy Clause now turn[ed] on whether the rule [wa]s a rule of\n\nprofessional ethics clearly covered by the McDade Act, or a substantive or procedural\n\nrule that [wa]s inconsistent with federal law.” 189 F.3d at 1284. In a nutshell, the\n\nessence of the inquiry was whether Rule 3.8 was preempted by federal law. Significantly,\n\n\n\n\n                     proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client\n                     unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:\n\n                     (1)    the information sought is not protected from disclosure\n                            by any applicable privilege;\n\n                     (2)    the evidence sought is essential to the successful\n                            completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution;\n\n                     (3)    there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the\n                            information.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fwe only addressed there, however, the question of whether Colorado’s Rule 3.8 was\n\npreempted outside of the grand-jury context—viz., the “trial” context.4 In this regard, in\n\ndefining the scope of our analysis, we stated: “In its decision on remand, the district court\n\ndetermined that the restriction on grand jury proceedings violated the Supremacy Clause.\n\nDefendants have not appealed that determination and we do not address it here.” Id.\n\n       Turning to the question at hand, we observed that Colorado’s Rule 3.8, inter alia,\n\nprescribed “broad normative principles of attorney self-conduct,” and we determined that\n\n“the rule in its current incarnation is a rule of ethics applicable to federal prosecutors by\n\nthe McDade Act.” Id. at 1288–89. Nevertheless, we proceeded to determine whether this\n\nethics rule was otherwise “inconsistent with federal law” and thus preempted. Id. at\n\n1289. We concluded that it was not, and therefore it could be “enforced by the state\n\ndefendants against federal prosecutors.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n              In Colorado Supreme Court II, we briefly intimated in a footnote that the\nuniverse of attorney subpoenas implicated by rules like Colorado’s consists of “grand jury\nand trial subpoenas.” 189 F.3d at 1286 n.6; see also id. at 1284 n.3 (describing the First\nCircuit as “holding federal courts could adopt a rule requiring a federal prosecutor at\neither the grand jury or trial stage to obtain judicial approval before serving a subpoena\non counsel to compel evidence concerning a client” (emphasis added)). We did not\ndefine the term “trial subpoenas” there, and it seems likely that, similar to the First\nCircuit, we were “us[ing] the term ‘trial subpoenas’ as a shorthand for all other\nsubpoenas (e.g., subpoenas issued in the course of pretrial hearings)”—i.e., all attorney\nsubpoenas issued by federal prosecutors in criminal proceedings other than grand-jury\nsubpoenas. Stern, 214 F.3d at 18 n.5 (emphasis added). In any event, we deem this\nshorthand convention to be helpful. We note that the United States employs it, and\nDefendants do not object. Accordingly, as needed, we use it here.\n\n                                               7\n\f                                                 B\n\n       Against this backdrop, in 2008, New Mexico adopted Rule 16-308(E), which\n\nprovides that:\n\n                 A prosecutor in a criminal case shall: . . .\n\n                 E.     not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal\n                        proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client\n                        unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:\n\n                        (1)    the information sought is not protected from disclosure\n                               by any applicable privilege;\n\n                        (2)    the evidence sought is essential to the successful\n                               completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution;\n                               and\n\n                        (3)    there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the\n                               information[.] . . .\n\nN.M. Rules of Prof’l Conduct, N.M.R.A. 16-308(E). This rule is identical to the\n\nColorado rule that we reviewed in Colorado Supreme Court II. Though the U.S. District\n\nCourt for the District of New Mexico has generally adopted the New Mexico Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct, see D.N.M.LR-Cr. 57.2, it has chosen not to adopt Rule 16-308(E),\n\nsee D.N.M. Admin. Order No. 10-MC-00004-9 (Mar. 23, 2010). Nonetheless, the rule\n\ncontinues to apply to the conduct of federal prosecutors licensed to practice in New\n\nMexico, and a violation of the rule can form the basis for disciplinary sanctions. See\n\nN.M. Rules Governing Discipline, N.M.R.A. 17-205.\n\n       The United States filed suit against Defendants in April 2013, arguing that the\n\nsecond and third requirements of Rule 16-308(E)—i.e., the essentiality and no-other-\n\n                                                 8\n\ffeasible-alternative conditions—were preempted by federal law. From the outset, these\n\ntwo provisions have been the only ones at issue in this litigation.5 Defendants moved to\n\ndismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the United\n\nStates lacked standing and that the case was not ripe in the absence of an actual or\n\nthreatened disciplinary action against a federal prosecutor. The district court rejected this\n\nargument and denied the motion. Relying in large part on our decision in Colorado\n\nSupreme Court I, it concluded that the complaint sufficiently alleged an injury in fact, to\n\nthe extent that Rule 16-308(E) altered federal prosecutors’ attorney-subpoena practice.

Mot. to Dismiss, filed Nov. 1,\n\n2013).\n\n         The United States moved for summary judgment in June 2013, before the parties\n\nhad engaged in any discovery. Attached to its summary-judgment motion, the United\n\nStates submitted the affidavit of an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of New\n\nMexico. The declaration described several instances in which prosecutors in the U.S.\n\nAttorney’s Office (“USAO”) had issued attorney subpoenas prior to the enactment of\n\n\n         5\n               It is undisputed that the United States does not challenge the first provision\nof Rule 16-308(E)—viz., subsection (E)(1)’s directive that a federal prosecutor must have\na reasonable belief that the information sought from an attorney is not protected from\ndisclosure by a privilege. In other words, this subsection is not at issue here. Throughout\nthis opinion, for convenience, we frequently refer in general terms to the United States’s\nchallenge to New Mexico’s Rule 16-308(E), without segregating out the two provisions\nof the rule that are actually at issue. Nonetheless, we underscore that a challenge to\nsubsection (E)(1) is not before us.\n\n                                              9\n\fRule 16-308(E); it suggested that, even though “[t]his evidence was obtained in a lawful\n\nmanner [and] implicated no privilege,” had Rule 16-308(E) been in effect, “it is unlikely\n\nthe prosecutor would have served the subpoena[s].” Id. at 80–81 (Decl. of Sasha Siemel,\n\nfiled June 28, 2013).\n\n       Addressing the rule’s current effect on the USAO’s work, the declarant noted that\n\n“Rule 11-308(E) has a ‘chilling’ effect on prosecutors.” Id. at 83. After averring that\n\nthere are “many examples of such situations,” the declaration discussed, in general\n\nterms—with the aim of preserving grand-jury secrecy—several specific instances in\n\nwhich prosecutors “have already actually [been] hampered . . . in the performance of their\n\notherwise lawful duties” by concerns that they would be disciplined for violating the\n\nessentiality or no-other-feasible-alternative conditions of Rule 16-308(E). Id. at 84. The\n\ndeclaration further provided:\n\n                These situations demonstrate that well-meaning prosecutors using legal\n                means of obtaining evidence of criminality are subject to discipline\n                simply for performing their duties. Federal grand juries in the District\n                of New Mexico will continue in the future to need evidence of crimes\n                from lawyers. In many such cases, the most appropriate means of\n                obtaining that evidence will be by subpoena. . . . If enforced against\n                federal prosecutors, Rule 16-308(E) will interfere directly with efforts\n                of this Office and the Department of Justice to enforce the criminal\n                laws of the United States.\n\nId. at 88–89.\n\n       Defendants filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d),\n\nasking the court to delay ruling on the United States’s summary-judgment motion\n\npending the completion of discovery. In the alternative, they moved for summary\n\n                                               10\n\fjudgment on the existing record, claiming that Rule 16-308(E) was a permissible ethics\n\nrule under the McDade Act and our opinion in Colorado Supreme Court II. The district\n\ncourt denied Defendants’ Rule 56(d) motion, concluding that further factual development\n\nwas unnecessary to decide the “purely legal question” of “whether or not Rule 16-308(E)\n\nis an ethical rule or a substantive rule.” Id. at 261 (Order Den. Defs.’ 56(d) Request for\n\nExtension of Time, filed Nov. 27, 2013).\n\n       After further briefing and argument, the court granted partial summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the United States and partial summary judgment in favor of Defendants.\n\nSpecifically, it determined that our decision in Colorado Supreme Court II compelled the\n\nconclusion that Rule 16-308(E) was not preempted by federal law as to criminal\n\nproceedings outside of the grand-jury context. However, it determined that the rule\n\nconflicted with “three strong governmental interests in grand jury proceedings of ‘[(1)]\n\naffording grand juries wide latitude, [(2)] avoiding minitrials on peripheral matters, and\n\n[(3)] preserving a necessary level of secrecy.’” Id. at 321 (Mem. Op. & Order, filed Feb.\n\n3, 2014) (alterations in original) (quoting United States v. R.

In particular, the court noted that the rule imposed “a higher burden on\n\nfederal prosecutors that is simply not warranted at the grand jury stage” and threatened\n\ngrand-jury secrecy by forcing prosecutors to disclose details of confidential investigations\n\nin order to avoid disciplinary sanctions. Id. at 322.\n\n       The district court thus upheld the application of Rule 16-308(E) to federal\n\nprosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas for criminal proceedings outside of the\n\n                                             11\n\fgrand-jury context, but enjoined Defendants from “instituting, prosecuting, or continuing\n\nany disciplinary proceeding or action against any federal prosecutor for otherwise lawful\n\nactions taken in the course of a grand jury investigation or proceeding on the ground that\n\nsuch attorneys violated Rule 16-308(E) of the New Mexico Rules of Professional\n\nConduct.” Id. at 326–27 (Final J., filed Feb. 3, 2014).\n\n                                               II\n\n       Both parties appeal from the district court’s judgment. Defendants challenge the\n\ndistrict court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, its denial of their request for further discovery,\n\nits holding that Rule 16-308(E) conflicts with federal law governing grand juries, and the\n\nscope of the injunction that the court issued. The United States challenges the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Rule 16-308(E) is not preempted outside of the grand-jury\n\ncontext. The United States’s appellate challenge, however, is primarily form, not\n\nsubstance. Though it seeks to “preserve [the preemption issue] for possible further\n\nreview,” Aplee.’s/Cross-Aplt.’s Reply Br. (“U.S. Reply Br.”) at 12, the United States\n\nacknowledges the precedential force of Colorado Supreme Court II and thus concedes\n\nthat Rule 16-308(E) is not preempted by federal law outside of the grand-jury context.\n\nConsequently, we resolve the United States’s appeal in summary fashion below. The\n\nheart of the parties’ dispute relates to whether Rule 16-308(E) is preempted relative to\n\nfederal prosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas in the grand-jury context.\n\nConsequently, our analysis naturally focuses extensively on this issue. However, before\n\nreaching the merits of this question, we must address Defendants’ threshold contentions\n\n                                               12\n\fregarding subject-matter jurisdiction and the district court’s refusal to allow them further\n\ndiscovery.\n\n                                               A\n\n       Defendants claim that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over this\n\ndispute because the United States does not have standing and because the case is not ripe\n\nfor review.

(“These allegations are sufficient to\n\nwithstand a motion to dismiss.”). Defendants seek to distinguish that decision because\n\nthe Colorado rule at issue involved a judicial preapproval requirement; such a distinction,\n\nhowever, is not persuasive. We specifically addressed the essentiality and no-other-\n\nfeasible-alternative conditions—which appear verbatim in New Mexico’s Rule 16-\n\n308(E)—and concluded that these “require[d] far more from federal prosecutors” and “set\n\na higher standard for obtaining attorney subpoenas” than is required by federal law or\n\ninternal agency guidelines.

(“Aplts.’ Opening Br.”) at 34.\n\n       Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, the summary-judgment declaration contains\n\nseveral factual statements demonstrating how Rule 16-308(E) has worked to the\n\ndetriment of federal prosecutors. In particular, after generally averring that there are\n\n“many examples of such situations,” the declaration specifically describes several\n\ninstances in which prosecutors “have already actually [been] hampered . . . in the\n\nperformance of their otherwise lawful duties” by concerns that they would be disciplined\n\nfor violating the essentiality or no-other-feasible-alternative conditions of Rule 16-\n\n308(E). Aplts.’ App. at 84. For example, the declaration offered the following:\n\n              The [USAO] investigated an investment fraud scheme perpetrated by\n              a target who, upon learning that he was under investigation, hired a\n              criminal defense attorney. The target used money generated by the\n              scheme to pay for his criminal defense, but he told a witness he had\n              used the money to pay the attorney for legal work related to the\n              supposed investment. Only the target and the attorney were in a\n              position to testify that the victim funds were used for his criminal\n\n                                                  16\n\f              defense and not for any actual investment-related purposes. The threat\n              of ethical sanctions posed by Rule l 6-308(E) prevented the prosecutor\n              from seeking this important evidence from the attorney. Consequently,\n              had the subpoena been issued, the prosecutor would have risked being\n              accused of seeking evidence that might later have been deemed\n              obtainable by alternative means or not ‘essential’ under Rule\n              16-308(E).\n\nId. at 84–85. This and the other examples offered in the declaration illustrate the United\n\nStates’s alleged injury with adequate particularity.\n\n       Furthermore, prosecutors’ efforts to avoid sanctions, and the resulting reduction in\n\navailable evidence in grand-jury and other criminal proceedings, demonstrate sufficient\n\ninjuries to establish federal-court jurisdiction.

Moreover, the declaration discusses a\n\ncase in which counsel for a criminal defendant sought to quash an attorney subpoena on\n\nthe basis that the prosecutor had obtained it in violation of Rule 16-308(E). Although this\n\nattempt to quash the subpoena failed, the declarant avers that the defense lawyer could\n\nhave also filed an ethics complaint against the prosecutor. See generally N.M.

Mar. 22, 2016) (concluding that certain organizations\n\nhad not established standing “[a]bsent any testimony indicating . . . [they] intended to\n\nengage in conduct that might violate” the statute at issue). Notably, Defendants have not\n\nindicated that the federal prosecutors will not be subject to discipline for disobeying Rule\n\n16-308(E). Thus, even in the absence of any actual enforcement action, Rule 16-308(E)\n\ncreates a sufficiently credible threat of prosecution to confer standing upon the United\n\nStates.\n\n                                              ii\n\n          Defendants base their self-inflicted-injury argument on Clapper v. Amnesty\n\nInternational USA; however, their reliance on this case is misguided. There, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that precautions taken by the plaintiffs to avoid the interception of their\n\ncommunications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 were self-\n\ninflicted, and did not establish standing, because the statute did “not regulate, constrain,\n\nor compel any action on [the plaintiffs’] part.” Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1153. The Court\n\nemphasized that any injury to the plaintiffs rested on a “highly attenuated chain of\n\npossibilities”—viz., that the government would (1) target specific individuals that the\n\nplaintiffs communicated with; (2) invoke its authority under the statutory provision at\n\n                                              20\n\fissue; (3) obtain authorization for the interception from a judge; and (4) actually intercept\n\ncommunications involving the plaintiffs. Id. at 1148.\n\n       However, in reviewing its standing jurisprudence, the Court recognized that, in\n\ncontrast, “reasonable efforts [taken] to avoid greater injuries” could be sufficient for\n\nstanding if the plaintiffs “would be subject to [discipline] but for their decision to take\n\npreventative measures.” Id. at 1153 (emphasis added) (discussing Monsanto Co. v.\n\nGeerston Seed Farms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149008\"><a href=\"/opinion/149008/holder-v-humanitarian-law-project/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">39 (2010), Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

This\n\nscenario—where standing could be found—which Clapper used to distinguish the\n\ncircumstances before it, is actually akin to the scenario of the present case. Thus, far\n\nfrom aiding Defendants, Clapper reinforces the view that where federal prosecutors\n\nlicensed in New Mexico take precautions that significantly hinder them from carrying out\n\ntheir lawful responsibilities to investigate and prosecute crimes, in order to avoid possible\n\ndisciplinary investigations and sanctions from state ethics officials, then the United States\n\nhas suffered a cognizable injury for standing purposes.\n\n       Lastly, in placing another spin on their self-inflicted injury argument against\n\nstanding, Defendants draw our attention to the fact that federal attorneys can practice\n\nbefore the District Court for the District of New Mexico without being licensed in New\n\nMexico. In other words, they point out that the United States Attorney could hire only\n\nattorneys without New Mexico law licenses as prosecutors in the District of New Mexico\n\noffice, or those seeking to be federal prosecutors in that office could forego a New\n\n                                              21\n\fMexico law licenses in favor of bar membership in another, less restrictive jurisdiction.\n\nIn view of these alternatives, Defendants argue that the individual choices of federal\n\nprosecutors or would-be federal prosecutors to hold New Mexico law licenses—and thus\n\nsubject themselves to Rule 16-308(E)—amounts to a self-inflicted injury, and not a harm\n\noccasioned by, or fairly traceable to, Defendants’ conduct relative to Rule 16-308(E).\n\n       Defendants’ position, however, is unconvincing because it is an injury in itself to\n\navoid lawful conduct—viz., obtaining a New Mexico law license—in order to avoid the\n\napplication of an allegedly unlawful Rule. See Meese, 481 U.S. at 475 (explaining that\n\n“the need to take . . . affirmative steps to avoid the risk of harm . . . constitutes a\n\ncognizable injury”); Dias v. City & Cty. of Denver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172192\"><a href=\"/opinion/172192/dias-v-city-and-county-of-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1177 (10th Cir. 2009)\n\n(concluding that the plaintiffs “suffered actual injuries because they were forced to move\n\nfrom Denver to avoid the reach of the [arguably unlawful] Ordinance”). Accordingly, we\n\nreject this iteration of Defendants’ self-inflicted injury argument.\n\n                                               iii\n\n       Twenty years ago, we stated that “federal prosecutors need not risk disbarment by\n\nviolating the Colorado Rules in order to challenge those rules in federal court.” Colorado\n\nSupreme Court I, 87 F.3d at 1167. Defendants do not persuade us that we should adopt a\n\ndifferent position with respect to New Mexico Rule 16-308(E). At both the pleadings and\n\nsummary-judgment stages of this litigation, the United States has adequately articulated\n\nits alleged injury. That injury—e.g., the issuance of fewer attorney subpoenas, resulting\n\nin a reduction in otherwise available evidence for law enforcement purposes—is not\n\n                                               22\n\fbased on an attenuated alignment of a variety of events. Rather, it stems from, and is\n\ntraceable to, the higher and conflicting standards imposed by Rule 16-308(E), which\n\nrestrict federal prosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas. And the relevant state\n\nauthorities have not disavowed an intention to sanction federal prosecutors who run afoul\n\nof these standards. In other words, the United States plainly faces a cognizable injury,\n\ntraceable to Rule 16-308(E),7 and we conclude that it has standing to challenge Rule 16-\n\n308(E).\n\n                                              2\n\n       The “[r]ipeness doctrine addresses a timing question: when in time is it appropriate\n\nfor a court to take up the asserted claim.” Kan.

See Colorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284 (noting that “this\n\nappeal . . . presents purely legal questions”); accord Stern, 214 F.3d at 10 (“The issue\n\npresented can be finally resolved by declaratory judgment, its contours are sharply\n\ndefined, and additional facts will not affect its resolution.”); see also Awad, 670 F.3d at\n\n1124 (“[O]n fitness, we ‘focus[ ] on whether determination of the merits turns upon\n\nstrictly legal issues or requires facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.’” (second\n\nalteration in original) (quoting Stout, 519 F.3d at 1118)).\n\n       Indeed, several courts—including our own—have resolved challenges to similar\n\nstate attorney-subpoena rules in the absence of specific applications, suggesting that the\n\nUnited States’s claim here is fit for judicial resolution.

However, outside of the realm of grand juries, the district court concluded\n\nthat it was bound by Colorado Supreme Court II, in which we held that an identical\n\nColorado ethics rule was not preempted by federal law governing prosecutors practicing\n\nin other criminal proceedings before federal district courts.\n\n       “We review the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment de novo,\n\napplying the same legal standards as the district court.” Qwest Corp. v. AT & T Corp.,\n\n\n\ndisagree. The Court in Armstrong held that there is no private right of action under the\nSupremacy Clause. 135 S. Ct. at 1384. The Court held that, in enacting the Medicaid\nstatute at issue, Congress intended to foreclose such private equitable relief by creating\nbroad “judicially unadministrable” standards and explicitly providing a nonjudicial means\nof enforcement—i.e., the withholding of Medicaid funds. Id. at 1385. However, in\ncontrast, nothing in the structure or terms of the McDade Act similarly suggests that\nCongress sought to override the federal courts’ equitable authority to entertain the United\nStates’s suit for injunctive relief on preemption grounds. Specifically, the McDade Act’s\ndirective is relatively straightforward—attorneys for the federal government are subject to\na state’s ethics rules to the same extent as attorneys licensed in those states—and the\nstatute provides no alternative means of enforcement. Furthermore, the Armstrong Court\nemphasized that allowing private enforcement of the Supremacy Clause would “mak[e] it\nimpossible to leave the enforcement of federal law to federal actors.” Id. at 1384. This, it\nnoted, would be inconsistent with the “discretion” the Constitution affords Congress\n“over the manner of implementing its enumerated powers.” Id. at 1383–84. To the extent\nthat Armstrong’s Supremacy Clause holding is motivated by the desire to preserve the\nfederal government’s “ability to guide the implementation of federal law,” id. at 1384,\nthis counsels in favor of—not against—permitting the United States to invoke preemption\nin order to protect its interest in the use of attorney subpoenas in federal prosecutions.\nSee Wyandotte Transp.

(“U.S. Response Br.”) at 7; see Aplts.’ App. at 7 (“As applied\n\nto federal prosecutors, New Mexico Rule of Professional Conduct 16-308(E) . . . violates\n\nthe Supremacy Clause . . . .”). Its “claim is ‘as applied’ in the sense that it does not seek\n\nto strike the [New Mexico rule] in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\n\n                                              32\n\f[federal prosecutors licensed to practice law in New Mexico]. The claim is ‘facial’ in that\n\nit is not limited to [a] particular case [i.e., a particular federal prosecutor’s issuance of a\n\nspecific attorney subpoena], but challenges application of the law more broadly to all\n\n[attorney subpoenas issued by all federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico].” Reed,\n\n561 U.S. at 194.\n\n       Put another way, the United States’s claim has characteristics of a facial challenge\n\nbecause it attacks on purely legal grounds—i.e., under the Supremacy Clause—certain\n\nprovisions of Rule 16-308(E) and contends that they are per se invalid. In this regard, the\n\nclaim does not relate to the circumstances of any particular attorney subpoena or any\n\nparticular trial or grand-jury investigation. But the claim also has characteristics of an as-\n\napplied challenge because it focuses solely on the constitutional ramifications of Rule 16-\n\n308(E)’s challenged provisions as they apply to a specific, narrowly defined\n\ngroup—federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico; it does not seek a determination that\n\nthe rule is invalid as applied to any other category of prosecutors (e.g., state or local\n\nprosecutors), and thus not all applications of the challenged provisions are encompassed\n\nby the claim.\n\n       The unique duality of the United States’s preemption claim has engendered\n\ndisagreement among the parties, and also some uncertainty—notably, by the claim’s\n\nproponent, the United States—regarding how to properly characterize it. The United\n\nStates has emphasized in litigating the jurisdictional, prudential justiciability, and\n\ndiscovery issues that the claim is “facial”; in so doing, it has sought to underscore the\n\n                                               33\n\flegal nature of the claim.11 See, e.g., Aplts.’ App. at 116 (Pl.’s Opp. to Defs.’ Mot. to\n\nDismiss, filed Sept. 20, 2013) (stating in opposing Defendants’ motion to dismiss on\n\nstanding and ripeness grounds that the “case is a facial challenge to the constitutionality\n\nof Rule 16-308(E), on grounds that the Rule invades a field completely occupied by\n\nfederal regulation and conflicts with federal law” (emphasis added)); id. at 265 (Pl.’s\n\n(Am.)

See id. at 20 (seeking a\n\ndeclaration in its complaint that Rule 16-308(E) was “invalid, null, and void, as applied\n\nto federal attorneys for otherwise lawful actions” (emphasis added)); id. at 33 (Mem. in\n\nSupp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Summ.

[W]hat\nwe meant by that . . . is facial in the sense of this is a purely legal determination based on\nSupremacy Clause principles . . . .

In its decision\n\ndenying New Mexico’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing and ripeness, for example,\n\nthe district court described the action as “facially challenging the New Mexico\n\nRule . . . as it applies to federal prosecutors.” Id. at 143. The court emphasized what it\n\nunderstood to be the facial nature of the challenge. See, e.g., id. at 151 (“The\n\noverwhelming majority of courts hold that cases involving facial challenges based upon\n\npreemption are fit for judicial review even without specific factual development.”). In\n\ndenying Defendants further discovery, the court again held that “facial preemption\n\nchallenges can be decided even in the absence of a detailed factual record. . . . The\n\ndetermination [of whether Rule 16-308(E) is preempted] is based upon the wording of the\n\nrule itself, not factual circumstances surrounding the enactment or enforcement of the\n\nrule.” Id. at 260–61 (Order Den. Pl.’s Mot. to Stay Briefing & Defs.’ 56(D) Req. for\n\nExtension, filed Nov. 27, 2013). Finally, in its order granting partial summary judgment\n\nto both parties, though the court noted that it was addressing a “facial[ ] challeng[e]” to\n\nRule 16-308(E), it also explicitly recognized that the United States sought to declare the\n\nrule invalid only “as it applies to federal prosecutors.” Id. at 306 (Mem.

More specifically,\n\nDefendants contend that the United States should be judicially estopped on appeal from\n\n“switch[ing] to an as-applied challenge for purposes of avoiding the more stringent\n\nrequirements for prevailing on the merits of a facial preemption challenge” after\n\n“[h]aving obtained the benefit of [ ] rulings from the district court based on a facial\n\nchallenge.” Aplts.’/Cross-Aplees.’ Response and Reply Br. (“Aplts.’ Reply Br.”) at\n\n19–20. They highlight a passage of the United States’s appellate brief, wherein it states\n\nthat “the United States challenges Rule 16-[3]08(E) only as-applied to federal prosecutors\n\nand only to those who seek to take ‘otherwise lawful actions’ prohibited by the New\n\nMexico rule.” U.S. Response Br. at 55 (quoting Aplts.’ App. at 20). The United States\n\ngoes on to argue that certain principles governing facial challenges that the Supreme\n\nCourt has announced do not apply because of the limited scope of its claim. Specifically,\n\nit contends that they “would not apply because the United States is not challenging all of\n\n                                             36\n\fthe applications of the New Mexico Rule, but rather a limited set of applications.” Id. at\n\n56.\n\n       Thus, advocating for the application of facial standards, Defendants contend that\n\nthe United States should be judicially estopped from making such an argument. For two\n\nsalient, independent reasons, however, we reject this contention.

In both settings, the United States has\n\npresented a legal preemption challenge to the validity of provisions of Rule 16-308(E), as\n\nthey apply to a limited subset of prosecutors—that is, federal prosecutors licensed in New\n\nMexico. True, in emphasizing the legal nature of its challenge in litigating the\n\njurisdictional, prudential justiciability, and discovery issues before the district court, it\n\ndenominated its claim as “facial,” whereas on appeal it seems to have avoided this label,\n\nbut the substance of its argument on appeal is not clearly inconsistent with the argument it\n\nmade below. Compare, e.g., Aplts.’ App. at 116–17 (in opposing Defendants’ motion to\n\ndismiss on standing and ripeness grounds, stating that the “case is a facial challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of Rule 16-308(E)” and that “the complaint has alleged each way in\n\nwhich the Rule is at odds with federal law and therefore violates the Supremacy Clause”),\n\nwith U.S. Response Br. at 18 (“The district court also correctly found that this case is ripe\n\n                                               39\n\ffor adjudication. Its resolution requires no further factual development . . . . The\n\nSupremacy Clause challenge here presents purely legal questions . . . .”). And, on\n\nappeal—as before the district court—the United States has emphasized that it only seeks\n\nto invalidate provisions of Rule 16-308(E) as applied to a limited subset of\n\nprosecutors—i.e., federal prosecutors. Compare, e.g., U.S. Response Br. at 55 (stating\n\nthat “the United States challenges Rule 16-[3]08(E) only as-applied to federal\n\nprosecutors”), with Aplts.’ App. at 49 (“[A]s applied to federal attorneys,\n\nRule 16-308(E) . . . . is not in fact an ‘ethical’ rule, and is invalid as applied to federal\n\nattorneys . . . .”).\n\n        Defendants’ argument to the contrary elides the unique duality of the claim and\n\noperates on the assumption that the United States’s challenge must be either “facial” or\n\n“as-applied”; under their reasoning, it cannot have characteristics of both. As noted\n\nabove, however, such an antipodal limitation is not required. See Reed, 561 U.S. at 194\n\n(noting that the claim at issue “obviously has characteristics of both” a facial and as-\n\napplied claim). And, in fact, the United States’s preemption claim has characteristics of\n\nboth a “facial” and an “as-applied” challenge. In sum, our first reason for rejecting\n\nDefendants’ judicial-estoppel argument is because the United States’s arguments in the\n\ndistrict court and on appeal are not clearly inconsistent.\n\n        Our second reason is because any ostensible inconsistency would involve solely\n\nlegal arguments; however, under our precedent, “the position to be estopped must\n\ngenerally be one of fact rather than of law or legal theory.” Johnson v.

It cannot be disputed that the facial and as-applied rubrics are legal in nature\n\nand form the basis for legal arguments. Therefore, even if the United States has shifted\n\non appeal from the position it held in the district court regarding the nature of its\n\nclaim—viz., from viewing it as facial to as-applied—that shift would be legal in nature.\n\nConsequently, under our precedent, the judicial-estoppel doctrine would be inapposite.12\n\n       In sum, for these two salient, independent reasons, we reject Defendants’ judicial-\n\nestoppel contention.\n\n                                               3\n\n       Having concluded that the United States’s argument with respect to its uniquely\n\ndual preemption claim is not barred by the judicial-estoppel doctrine, we must still\n\n\n\n       12\n              Of course, “lesser weapons,” Vehicle Mkt.

The United States appears to generally resist application\n\nof a facial standard and, most notably, flatly rejects application of the Salerno standard,\n\ncontending that it “would not apply because the United States is not challenging all of the\n\napplications of the New Mexico Rule, but rather a limited set of applications.” U.S.\n\n                                              42\n\fResponse Br. at 56.\n\n       We conclude, under the parameters defined below, that the standards for a facial\n\nclaim are appropriate here.\n\n                                               a\n\n       As noted, the United States’s “claim is ‘as applied’ in the sense that it does not\n\nseek to strike the [Rule 16-308(E)] in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\n\n[federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico]. The claim is ‘facial’ in that it is not\n\nlimited to [a] particular case [i.e., a particular federal prosecutor’s issuance of a specific\n\nattorney subpoena], but challenges application of the law more broadly to all [attorney\n\nsubpoenas issued by all federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico].” Reed, 561 U.S. at\n\n194. The Supreme Court’s decision in Reed is instructive in discerning the appropriate\n\nlegal standard for resolution of this case because there (as the First Circuit observed) the\n\nCourt “faced a similar duality in the First Amendment Context.” Showtime Entm’t, 769\n\nF.3d at 70.\n\n       The foundation for the lawsuit in Reed was the public-records statute (“PRA”) of\n\nthe State of Washington, which “authorize[d] private parties to obtain copies of\n\ngovernment documents, and the State construe[d] the PRA to cover submitted referendum\n\npetitions.” 561 U.S. at 191. The Court succinctly introduced the case’s factual\n\nbackground, the legal issue, and its resolution of it:\n\n                     This case arises out of a state law extending certain benefits to\n              same-sex couples, and a corresponding referendum petition to put that\n              law to a popular vote. Respondent intervenors invoked the PRA to\n\n                                                   43\n\f              obtain copies of the petition, with the names and addresses of the\n              signers. Certain petition signers and the petition sponsor objected,\n              arguing that such public disclosure would violate their rights under the\n              First Amendment.\n\n                     The course of this litigation, however, has framed the legal\n              question before us more broadly. The issue at this stage of the case is\n              not whether disclosure of this particular petition would violate the First\n              Amendment, but whether disclosure of referendum petitions in general\n              would do so. We conclude that such disclosure does not as a general\n              matter violate the First Amendment, and we therefore affirm the\n              judgment of the Court of Appeals. We leave it to the lower courts to\n              consider in the first instance the signers’ more focused claim\n              concerning disclosure of the information on this particular petition,\n              which is pending before the District Court.\n\nId.\n\n       In the claim at issue in Reed, the plaintiffs averred that the PRA “violates the First\n\nAmendment as applied to referendum petitions.” Id. at 194 (emphasis added) (quoting\n\nCount I of the Complaint). As here, the parties jousted about whether the claim was\n\n“properly viewed as a facial or as-applied challenge.” Id. The Court, however,\n\nrecognized that facial and as-applied are not mutually exclusive or antipodal constructs,\n\nobserving that the claim “obviously has characteristics of both.” Id. Elaborating, the\n\nCourt said:\n\n                      The claim is “as applied” in the sense that it does not seek to\n              strike the PRA in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\n              referendum petitions. The claim is “facial” in that it is not limited to\n              plaintiffs’ particular case, but challenges application of the law more\n              broadly to all referendum petitions.\n\nId.\n\n       Critically for our purposes, the Court then offered guidance on how—in the\n\n                                             44\n\fcontext of such duality—to determine which analytical construct is most apt for\n\nresolution of the underlying substantive claim. It began by observing that “[t]he label\n\n[i.e., facial or as-applied] is not what matters.” Id. “The important point,” it said, is\n\nwhether the “plaintiffs’ claim and the relief that would follow . . . reach beyond the\n\nparticular circumstances of the[ ] plaintiffs.” Id. The Court concluded that this was true\n\nin that case, where the plaintiffs sought in the claim at issue “an injunction barring the\n\nsecretary of state ‘from making referendum petitions available to the public,’” not just an\n\ninjunction barring the public disclosure of the referendum petition involving them,\n\nrelating to same-sex marriage. Id. (quoting Count I of the Complaint). As such, the\n\nCourt concluded that, irrespective of the “label” that the plaintiffs attached to their claim,\n\n“[t]hey must therefore satisfy our standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that\n\nreach.” Id.\n\n       We read Reed as offering three key lessons for discerning the appropriate\n\nanalytical lens for conducting a substantive constitutional analysis—lessons that are\n\napplicable at least where the claims evince a duality as here: first, the labels the parties\n\nattach to claims are not determinative; second, in determining whether to apply facial\n\nstandards to the claim, importantly, the court must focus on whether the claim and the\n\nrelief therein extend beyond the plaintiffs’ particular circumstances; and third, if the claim\n\nand relief do so, facial standards are applied but only to the universe of applications\n\ncontemplated by plaintiffs’ claim, not to all conceivable applications contemplated by the\n\nchallenged provision. See, e.g., Showtime Entm’t, 769 F.3d at 70 (in holding that facial\n\n                                              45\n\fstandards apply, stating “[w]e understand the relief sought here to be the invalidation of\n\nthe zoning bylaws, not merely a change in their application to Showtime[;] . . . . it is clear\n\nthat this is a request that ‘reach[es] beyond’ the precise circumstances of Showtime’s\n\nlicense application” (third alteration in original) (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194));\n\nCatholic Leadership Coal., 764 F.3d at 426 (“[T]o categorize a challenge as facial or as-\n\napplied we look to see whether the ‘claim and the relief that would follow . . . reach\n\nbeyond the particular circumstances of the [ ] plaintiffs.’ If so, regardless of how the\n\nchallenge is labeled by a plaintiff, ‘[t]hey must therefore satisfy our standards for a facial\n\nchallenge to the extent of that reach.’” (second and third alterations in original) (citation\n\nomitted) (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194)); Discount Tobacco City & Lottery, Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625579\"><a href=\"/opinion/625579/discount-tobacco-city-lottery-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (6th Cir. 2012) (“In this case, Plaintiffs label their\n\nclaims as both facial and as-applied challenges to the Act, but because the ‘plaintiffs’\n\nclaim and the relief that would follow . . . reach beyond the particular circumstances of\n\nthese plaintiffs,’ the claims that are raised are properly reviewed as facial challenges to\n\nthe Act.” (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194)); see also Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun.\n\nEmps. Council 79, 717 F.3d at 862 (“We look to the scope of the relief requested to\n\ndetermine whether a challenge is facial or as-applied in nature.”).\n\n       Further explication may clarify the contours of the third lesson. As noted, a\n\nparadigmatic facial challenge is “a head-on attack [on a] legislative judgment, an\n\nassertion that the challenged statute violates the Constitution in all, or virtually all, of its\n\napplications.” Carel, 668 F.3d at 1217 (quoting Pruitt, 502 F.3d at 1171). However,\n\n                                               46\n\fwhere the claim at issue evinces the kind of duality at issue here—that is, reflects\n\ncharacteristics of both facial and as-applied challenges—the facial analysis that Reed\n\nenvisions is more limited in scope than that employed for paradigmatic facial claims.13\n\nSpecifically, the analysis does not attempt to assay the constitutional validity of all or\n\nvirtually all of the applications of the challenged provision. Instead, it focuses on only\n\nthe constitutional validity of the subset of applications targeted by the plaintiffs’\n\nsubstantive claim. Consequently, using the language of Reed, plaintiffs asserting such a\n\ndual claim are obliged to “satisfy our standards for a facial challenge” but only “to the\n\nextent of that [claim’s] reach”—which means only insofar as the claim is actually facial\n\nin character, in that it “reach[es] beyond the particular circumstances of the[ ] plaintiffs.”\n\nReed, 561 U.S. at 194.\n\n       This third lesson was concretely displayed in Reed. The Court concluded that the\n\nfacial standard should be applied to the plaintiffs’ dual claim—a claim that, in part,\n\n“obviously ha[d] characteristics of” a facial challenge, id.—because their claim attacked\n\nthe public records statute’s disclosure requirements related to “referendum petitions in\n\ngeneral,” not only the disclosure requirements as they applied to the particular\n\nreferendum petition at issue involving same-sex marriage, id. at 191. Demonstrating the\n\nthird lesson, Reed only applied a facial analysis to the public records statute insofar as it\n\n\n\n       13\n               Indeed, one of our sister circuits has recognized that these dual claims are\nqualitatively distinct from paradigmatic facial claims by describing the former as “quasi-\nfacial in nature.” Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., 717 F.3d at 863.\n\n                                              47\n\fwas construed to reach referendum petitions—not to the statute as a whole, which applied\n\nto other records as well. See id. at 194. In other words, Reed applied the facial analysis\n\nto the public records statute “to the extent [that the claim’s] reach” went beyond the\n\ndisclosure requirements related to the same-sex marriage referendum petitions to include\n\nreferendum petitions generally—but, critically, no further than that. See id. Some of our\n\nsister circuits appear to have tacitly recognized and applied Reed’s third lesson. See, e.g.,\n\nShowtime Entm’t, 769 F.3d at 70–71 (applying facial analysis to claim that extended\n\nbeyond plaintiff’s specific circumstances—that is, a license application—but extending it\n\nno further than the zoning ordinance impacting plaintiff and other adjacent landowners\n\nengaged in the same business); Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., 717 F.3d at 865\n\n(in the context of a dual claim “conclud[ing] that the district court granted what\n\neffectively amounted to facial relief—or, at the very least, relief that had enough\n\ncharacteristics of facial relief to demand satisfaction” of facial standards, and proceeding\n\nto apply those standards only to the extent that the challenged executive order reached\n\nbeyond the particular circumstances of the plaintiffs).\n\n       Guided by Reed and its three key lessons, we conclude that facial standards should\n\nbe applied to the United States’s preemption claim but only to the extent that the\n\nchallenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) impact federal prosecutors licensed in New\n\nMexico and their attorney-subpoena practices. First, because labels are not important, the\n\nUnited States’s use of as-applied verbiage in its complaint, see Aplts.’ App. at 20\n\n(seeking a declaration in its complaint that Rule 16-308(E) was “invalid, null, and void,\n\n                                             48\n\fas applied to federal attorneys for otherwise lawful actions” (emphasis added)), should\n\nnot deter us from determining whether facial standards actually provide the appropriate\n\ntouchstone. See Reed, 561 U.S. at 194 (applying facial standards, though the count of the\n\ncomplaint at issue alleged that the PRA “violate[d] the First Amendment as applied to\n\nreferendum petitions” (emphasis added) (quoting Count I of the Complaint)). Second, the\n\nUnited States’s claim and its desired relief clearly extend beyond the particular\n\ncircumstances of any particular federal prosecutor issuing an attorney subpoena. The\n\nUnited States has sought to bar enforcement of certain provisions of Rule 16-308(E)\n\nrelative to all federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico who issue attorney\n\nsubpoenas—irrespective, for example, of the evidentiary needs of a particular grand-jury\n\ninvestigation. Accordingly, following Reed, we rightly apply facial standards to the\n\nresolution of the United States’s claim. Finally, applying Reed’s third lesson, the facial\n\nanalysis should extend to a preemption analysis of the challenged provisions Rule 16-\n\n308(E), but only insofar as they apply to federal prosecutors licensed in New Mexico who\n\nissue attorney subpoenas.14 We turn now to determine whether Salerno’s no-set-of-\n\ncircumstances language or some other rubric is the appropriate one to apply here.\n\n\n       14\n              Indeed, although starting from different places, both parties appear to\nacknowledge that the relevant universe for analysis is this federal-prosecutor group.\nCompare Aplts.’ Reply Br. at 3–4 (“Plaintiff must meet its burden to show that there is no\nset of circumstances under which Rule 16-308(E) could apply with respect to a\nprosecutor’s conduct in issuing a federal grand subpoena to an attorney.”), with U.S.\nResponse Br. at 56 (noting that “the United States is not challenging all of the\napplications of the New Mexico Rule, but rather a limited set of applications” involving\n“federal prosecutors who issue grand jury subpoenas”).\n\n                                             49\n\f                                             b\n\n                                              i\n\n       Defendants argue that, in order to meet the “standard[ ] for a facial challenge,”\n\nAplts.’ Reply Br. at 51–52 (quoting Reed, 561 U.S. at 194), the United States must\n\ndemonstrate that “no set of circumstances exists under which [Rule 16-308(E)] would be\n\nvalid,” Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745. As noted, the United States contends that Salerno’s\n\nfacial standards are inapplicable here.15\n\n       While both the Supreme Court and our court have questioned whether Salerno’s\n\nno-set-of-circumstances language applies to all facial challenges, see, e.g., United States\n\nv.

Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., 717 F.3d at 863 (noting that “Salerno\nalso applies when a court grants relief that is quasi-facial in nature”)—but only to the\nextent of the challenged subset.

In resolving the preemption claim in that case, we framed the inquiry as\n\nfollows: “whether [the rule] violates the Supremacy Clause . . . turns on whether the rule\n\nis a rule of professional ethics clearly covered by the McDade Act, or a substantive or\n\nprocedural rule that is inconsistent with federal law.” Id. at 1284. Even though we\n\ndetermined that the rule was an ethics rule, we nevertheless examined whether this ethics\n\nrule was otherwise “inconsistent with federal law” and thus preempted. Id. at 1289.

See, e.g., Stern, 214 F.3d at 20–21;\nColorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1288–89; Baylson, 975 F.2d at 111–12.\n\n                                             56\n\fapply this analytical framework to the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E).20\n\n                                              a\n\n       The McDade Act explicitly subjects federal attorneys “to State laws and\n\nrules . . . governing attorneys in each State . . . to the same extent and in the same manner\n\n\n       20\n               Our esteemed colleague in dissent contends that our examination in\nColorado Supreme Court II of whether Colorado’s Rule 3.8—which we had determined\nwas an ethics rule—was “inconsistent with federal law,” 189 F.3d at 1289, was “a brief\naside at the end of the opinion,” Dissent at 7, without decisional significance. In this\nvein, the dissent contends that “the first and only question we must answer is: whether the\nrule is one governing ethics? If it is, considering the burden on federal interests is\nunnecessary because Congress has authorized the rule’s application to federal\nprosecutors.” Dissent at 3. We must respectfully disagree. The panel in Colorado\nSupreme Court II effectively engaged in a conflict-preemption analysis—an inquiry into\nthe presence of impermissible inconsistency vel non with federal law—after determining\nthat Colorado Rule 3.8 was an ethics rule, and expressly rendered a holding on the\npreemption question. In this regard, we stated there:\n\n                      [W]e hold that Rule 3.8, in its mandate that a federal prosecutor\n              ought not to disturb an attorney-client relationship without a showing\n              of cause, does not conflict with Fed. R. CIM. P. 17, which details only\n              the procedures for issuing a proper subpoena. Rule 17 does not\n              abrogate the power of courts to hold an attorney to the broad normative\n              principles of attorney self-conduct. Accordingly, we hold that Rule 3.8\n              is not inconsistent with federal law and can be adopted and enforced by\n              the state defendants against federal prosecutors.\n\nColorado Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1288–89 (emphases added). It is pellucid that\nwe considered our holding regarding the absence of an impermissible inconsistency (i.e.,\nthe absence of a conflict) with federal law essential to our conclusion that Colorado could\nenforce Rule 3.8 against federal prosecutors in the trial (i.e., non-grand-jury context). It\nwas not an aside or casual piece of dictum that we may now disregard. Therefore,\ncontrary to the dissent, in applying the rule of Colorado Supreme Court II, we do not\nbelieve that our analysis can end if we determine that Rule 16-308(E) is an ethics rule.\nInstead, we must still determine whether Rule 16-308(E) conflicts with relevant federal\nlaw.\n\n\n                                             57\n\fas other attorneys in that State.” 28 U.S.C. § 530B(a). In Colorado Supreme Court II, we\n\nconsidered whether the Colorado rule could be deemed an ethics rule—notably, a\n\n“normative legal standard[ ] that guides the conduct of an attorney”—such that it fell\n\nwithin the McDade Act’s purview. 189 F.3d at 1285. We defined an ethics rule as one\n\nthat: (1) “bar[s] conduct recognized by consensus within the profession as inappropriate”;\n\n(2) is phrased as “a commandment dealing with morals and principles”; (3) is “vague\n\n[and] sweeping” rather than highly specific; and (4) is “directed at the attorney herself”\n\nrather than “at the progress of the claim.” Id. at 1287–88. Measured against these\n\ncriteria, we concluded that the Colorado rule was an ethics rule of the type that the\n\nMcDade Act contemplates. More specifically, as we saw it, the rule sought to safeguard\n\nthe attorney-client relationship—which “by general consensus of our profession [is]\n\nworthy of protection”—and was phrased as a vague, sweeping commandment “directed at\n\nthe prosecutor, not at the cause of action.” Id. at 1288.\n\n       This reasoning applies with equal force to Rule 16-308(E). It contains identical\n\nlanguage to that found in Colorado Rule 3.8(e), and, as the commentary to the rule makes\n\nclear, it is intended to limit the issuance of attorney subpoenas to only “those situations in\n\nwhich there is a genuine need to intrude into the client-lawyer relationship.” N.M. Rules\n\nof Prof’l Conduct, N.M.R.A. 16-308(E) cmt. 4. As such, under Colorado Supreme Court\n\nII, Rule 16-308(E) is an ethics rule of the sort covered by the McDade Act.21\n\n\n       21\n               In contrast, in Stern, the First Circuit concluded that the Massachusetts rule\nat issue “clearly extend[ed] beyond the shelter that section 530B provides” because it\n\n                                             58\n\f                                              b\n\n       We must next determine whether the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E),\n\ndespite being within the purview of the McDade Act, are otherwise inconsistent with (i.e.,\n\nconflict with) federal law. As evident from the analysis in Colorado Supreme Court II,\n\nthe fact that a challenged state rule is determined to be an ethics rule within the McDade\n\nAct’s ambit does not necessarily mean that Congress intended that rule to trump or\n\nimpede the effectuation of otherwise applicable federal law. See Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt II, 189 F.3d at 1289 (proceeding to determine whether the ethics rule covered by\n\nthe McDade Act was otherwise “inconsistent with federal law”); see also Stern, 214 F.3d\n\nat 19 (“[I]t simply cannot be said that Congress, by enacting section 530B, meant to\n\nempower states (or federal district courts, for that matter) to regulate government\n\nattorneys in a manner inconsistent with federal law.”); cf.

Specifically, the United States\n\nacknowledges that Rule 16-308(E) does not conflict with federal law governing trial\n\nsubpoenas; therefore, it is not preempted. In this regard, in Colorado Supreme Court II,\n\nwe determined that a Colorado ethics rule (i.e., Rule 3.8(e)) that had language identical to\n\nRule 16-308(E) was not in conflict with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17—which,\n\n                                              60\n\fgenerally speaking, governs the process for subpoenaing testimonial and documentary\n\nevidence for trial—because Rule 17 was procedural and did “not abrogate the power of\n\ncourts to hold an attorney to the broad normative principles of attorney self-conduct.”\n\n189 F.3d at 1289.22 The United States wisely acknowledges that this holding is\n\ndispositive here. Therefore, we conclude that the district court appropriately determined\n\nthat the challenged provisions of Rule 16-308(E) are not preempted relative to federal\n\nprosecutors’ issuance of attorney subpoenas in criminal proceedings outside of the grand-\n\njury context.23\n\n       22\n              Notably, we distinguished Baylson, in which the Third Circuit held that\nPennsylvania’s attorney-subpoena rule was preempted in the trial context, because the\nPennsylvania rule contained a judicial preapproval requirement and Rule 17 makes “no\nallowances for the court’s intervention in the subpoena procedures.” Colorado Supreme\nCourt II, 189 F.3d at 1286. Like the Colorado rule, Rule 16-308(E) contains no such\npreapproval requirement.\n       23\n               We recognize that after we issued Colorado Supreme Court II, the First\nCircuit in Stern held that “the ‘essentiality’ and ‘no feasible alternative’ requirements [of\nthe largely similar ethics rule at issue there] are substantially more onerous . . . than the\ntraditional motion-to-quash standards” of Rule 17. 214 F.3d at 18. Specifically, the First\nCircuit held that essentiality is “a more demanding criterion than relevancy or\nmateriality” and that “Rule 17 jurisprudence contains no corollary to the” no-other-\nfeasible-alternative requirement. Id. It thus concluded that these “novel\nrequirements . . . threaten[ed] to preclude the service of otherwise unimpeachable\nsubpoenas and thus restrict[ed] the flow of relevant, material evidence to the factfinder.”\nId. In substance, the court concluded that the essentiality and no-other-feasible-\nalternative provisions conflicted with otherwise applicable federal law relative to trial\nsubpoenas (i.e., subpoenas issued outside of the grand-jury context) and were thus\npreempted. Notwithstanding the First Circuit’s contrary reasoning in Stern, we remain\nbound by our controlling decision in Colorado Supreme Court II, which concluded that a\nrule identical to Rule 16-308(E) did not run afoul of federal law governing trial\nsubpoenas.

For example, in Costello, the Court rebuffed a defendant’s\nargument that indictments should be “open to challenge on the ground that there was\ninadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury.” 350 U.S. at 363.

As Costello illustrates, federal grand-jury law is firmly grounded in the text and\nhistory of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

However, we\n\nremain acutely aware of the fact that, by the Framers’ express design, the federal grand\n\njury has an independent constitutional stature and stands apart from all three branches of\n\ngovernment. Consequently, it seems safe to reason that Congress’s power to authorize\n\nstates to burden the grand jury’s investigative functions is not unbounded.

On the basis that we\n\nresolve this case, this argument is unavailing: regardless of whether disciplinary\n\nproceedings would only compromise grand-jury secrecy in certain situations—a\n\nproposition we consider dubious—the essentiality and no-other-feasible-alternative\n\nrequirements conflict overall with federal grand-jury practice because they impose overly\n\nrestrictive standards for the issuance of attorney subpoenas in every instance.

Thus, despite categorizing the rule as one governing “ethics,” which\n\nCongress clearly intended to apply to federal prosecutors, the majority reads\n\nColorado Supreme Court II to also require a conflict preemption analysis.\n\nApplying the obstacle-conflict preemption doctrine, the majority holds New\n\nMexico’s rule is preempted in the grand jury context because it places more\n\nonerous conditions on federal prosecutors issuing subpoenas than required by the\n\nSupreme Court in United States v.

The\n\nmajority grounds its preemption analysis not in any congressional\n\nmandate—because, indeed, Congress expressly stated federal prosecutors “shall\n\nbe subject” to state ethics rules—but in the Constitution’s text by way of the Fifth\n\nAmendment’s Grand Jury Clause. But New Mexico’s rule is not inconsistent with\n\nthe Grand Jury Clause’s guarantee that “[n]o person shall be held to answer for a\n\ncapital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless in a presentment or indictment of a\n\nGrand Jury.” Instead, the rule merely instructs prosecutors practicing in New\n\nMexico (federal or state alike) of their professional duty when issuing subpoenas\n\nto third-party lawyers in criminal cases.\n\n      As I see it, the first and only question we must answer is: whether the rule\n\nis one governing ethics? If it is, considering its burden on federal interests is\n\nunnecessary because Congress has authorized the rule’s application to federal\n\nprosecutors. And because Colorado Supreme Court II classified an identical rule\n\nas an ethics rule, the answer is straightfoward. Since the majority’s holding\n\n                                            3\n\fdeparts from Congress’s clear intent to apply all state ethics rules to federal\n\nprosecutors, I respectfully dissent. 3\n\n                                    I. Discussion\n\n      A. The McDade Amendment\n\n      I begin with the statutory background on which we all agree. No one\n\ndisputes that “state regulation” of “federal . . . activities” can be authorized by a\n\n“clear congressional mandate” making that “authorization of state regulation clear\n\nand unambiguous.” Hancock v. Train, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109467\"><a href=\"/opinion/109467/hancock-v-train/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179 (1976). The United\n\nStates, of course, acknowledges there is no Supremacy Clause problem if federal\n\nlaw unambiguously authorizes the application of the state rules at issue here. See\n\nSecond Br. at 38 (“[I]f Congress has, through the McDade Act, clearly and\n\nunambiguously authorized the application to federal prosecutors of [the rule],\n\nNew Mexico has not violated the Supremacy Clause.”). And the Amendment’s\n\ntext is clear: “An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws and\n\nrules . . . governing attorneys in each State where such attorney engages in that\n\nattorney’s duties, to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in\n\nthat State.” § 530B(a); Colo. Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284 (noting state\n\nlaws and rules contemplated by the Amendment are “state professional rules” or\n\n\n\n      3\n         I concur with the majority’s conclusions on standing and ripeness. My\nanalysis is the same no matter whether we look at the challenge facially or as-\napplied.\n\n                                          4\n\f“rule[s] of professional ethics”).\n\n      Indisputably, then, if a state rule is an ethics rule, the McDade Amendment\n\nclearly and unambiguously authorizes its application to federal prosecutors. No\n\none doubts this is an ethics rule in at least one context. In Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt II, we created a test for determining whether a rule is an ethics rule and\n\napplied the test to hold an identical rule as ethical in all non-grand-jury criminal\n\nproceedings. 4 189 F.3d at 1284, 1288. The question in that case was whether a\n\nColorado rule identical to New Mexico’s violated the Supremacy Clause as\n\napplied in “criminal proceedings other than a grand jury.” Id. at 1284. As the\n\nmajority notes, that question turned on whether the rule was “‘a rule of\n\nprofessional ethics clearly covered by the McDade Act, or a substantive or\n\nprocedural rule that is inconsistent with federal law.’” Majority Op. 5, 55\n\n(quoting Colo. Supreme Court II, 189 F.3d at 1284).\n\n      We first noted the definition of “ethical”: “‘[o]f or relating to moral action,\n\n\n\n      4\n         Colorado Supreme Court II was the second time we had addressed the\nUnited States’s Supremacy Clause challenge to this Colorado rule.

In short, the question was\n\nwhether Colorado’s rule was “one of those normative legal standards that guides\n\nthe conduct of an attorney.” Id.\n\n      To answer that question, we outlined a three-prong test. 5 “First,” an ethical\n\nrule bars “conduct recognized by consensus within the profession as\n\ninappropriate.” Id. at 1287. “Second,” such rules are like “commandment[s]\n\ndealing with morals and principles” and in “directing sweeping commandments of\n\nconduct” can be “quite vague” in nature, in contrast to procedural or substantive\n\nlaw, “the purposes of which are to direct a cause of action through the courts.”\n\nId. “Finally,” such rules are “directed at the attorney herself.” Id. “Applying\n\n[those] factors” to Colorado’s rule, we “easily conclud[ed] the rule [was] an\n\n\n\n      5\n         Notably, this means a rule is not applicable to federal prosecutors just\nbecause a state enacts rules of professional responsibility; the state rule must still\npass our three-prong test. In other words, the McDade Amendment does not give\nstates carte blanche to regulate federal prosecutors under the guise of ethical\nregulation.\n\n                                          6\n\fethical one.” Id. at 1288.\n\n      But the majority relies on a brief aside at the end of the opinion, made after\n\nwe applied our test and concluded the rule was an ethics rule, that Colorado’s rule\n\nalso “does not conflict with” a particular federal rule of criminal procedure and,\n\n“[a]ccordingly, . . . is not inconsistent with federal law.” Id at 1288–89. That\n\nstatement, however, is merely an affirmation of the truism that it is not\n\ninconsistent with federal law to apply state ethics rules as federal law instructs.\n\n      A natural reading of the opinion and a reasonable understanding of the\n\nword “ethical” supports that position. We plainly thought what mattered was the\n\nmeaning of the word ethical, and every factor we announced goes to the essence\n\nof that word. The Amendment speaks of “Ethical standards,” § 530B, and we\n\ngenerally interpret words in a statute “as taking their ordinary, contemporary,\n\ncommon meaning.” Bilski v. Kappos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149649\"><a href=\"/opinion/149649/bilski-v-kappos/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (2010). And a rule\n\ngoverning ethics, by our own definition, is neither a substantive nor procedural\n\nrule. Thus, the McDade Amendment suffices to ensure that rules of truly ethical\n\nconcern fit unobtrusively into the federal scheme, because it explicitly deems\n\nsuch rules applicable to federal prosecutors.\n\n      And I cannot see how New Mexico’s rule is any less a “normative legal\n\nstandard[]” guiding “the conduct of an attorney,” Colo. Supreme Court II, 189\n\nF.3d at 1285, than the identical rule we considered in Colorado Supreme Court II\n\nbecause it might affect federal prosecutors in grand-jury practice. It, no less,\n\n                                           7\n\f“bar[s] conduct recognized by consensus within the profession as inappropriate.”\n\nId. at 1287. It deals with the same “morals and principles” as that rule, and, like\n\nthat rule, it is “directed at the attorney herself.” Id. Because we are bound by\n\nColorado Supreme Court II, there is no Supremacy Clause violation here. 6\n\n      The foregoing analysis of the McDade Amendment’s plain language and\n\nour decision in Colorado Supreme Court II demonstrates the infirmity of the\n\nSupremacy Clause argument. But understanding the problem Congress wished to\n\nfix by passing the McDade Amendment operates to underscore the inapplicability\n\nof an additional independent preemption analysis.\n\n      In 1989, the Department of Justice issued the “Thornburgh Memorandum,”\n\nwhich concluded that “although the states have the authority to regulate the\n\nethical conduct of attorneys admitted to practice” in their courts, federal\n\nprosecutors may only be regulated in that manner “if the regulation does not\n\nconflict with the federal law or with the attorneys’ federal responsibilities.”\n\nBruce A.

Rev.\n\n\n      6\n         The United States also challenges the application of New Mexico’s rule\noutside the grand jury context. But as the majority explains, this challenge “is\nprimarily form, not substance.” Majority Op. 12. I agree with the majority that\nour review is confined by our prior conclusions in Colorado Supreme Court II,\nMajority Op. 60, absent direction from the Supreme Court or the en banc panel. I\nalso note the Supreme Court has not had the opportunity to construe whether our\ndelineation between rules that are ethical and those that are substantive or\nprocedural is a correct one.\n\n                                          8\n\f460, 471 (1996) (quoting Memorandum from Dick Thornburgh, Attorney General,\n\nU.S. Department of Justice, to All Justice Department Litigators (June 8, 1989)).\n\nThe DOJ intended to insulate federal prosecutors in at least some circumstances\n\nfrom compliance with state ethics rules modeled upon ABA Model Rule 4.2,\n\nwhich prohibited ex-parte attorney contacts with a represented party.

Grand-Jury Practice and Procedure as Preemptive\n\n      In proceeding with its preemption analysis, the majority rests its\n\npreemption finding on the role grand-jury practice and procedure plays in the\n\nfederal legal system—particularly, that New Mexico’s rule imposes more onerous\n\nconditions on federal prosecutors issuing subpoenas to third-party lawyers in a\n\ngrand jury context than required by the Supreme Court in United States v. R.\n\nEnterprises, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112523\"><a href=\"/opinion/112523/united-states-v-r-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991). Majority Op. 61–71. So to adhere to the\n\nSupremacy Clause’s dictate that only three named sources of federal law enjoy\n\nsupremacy (“This Constitution,” “the Laws of the United States,” and “all\n\nTreaties,” Const. art. VI, cl. 2) the majority reasons the grand-jury subpoena\n\nstandard must be traced to the constitutional significance of grand juries as\n\nrecognized in the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause. 9\n\n\n      9\n         The majority also concludes New Mexico’s rule stands as an obstacle to\nthe important investigative function of grand juries. But New Mexico’s rule (as a\nrule of ethics) is not directed at the grand jury as an institution. It is directed\nonly at prosecutors. Simply because the prevailing practice is for prosecutors to\nissue subpoenas on behalf of grand juries, Sara S. Beale, et al., Grand Jury Law &\nPrac. § 6:2 (2d ed.), is insufficient to conclude the rule violates the Supremacy\n\n                                         12\n\f      As an initial matter, I note the peculiar circumstances that this case\n\npresents. Our conflict preemption analysis requires us to compare a state statute\n\nto its federal counterpart and evaluate whether (1) “compliance with both federal\n\nand state regulations is a physical impossibility,” or (2) “the challenged state law\n\nstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes\n\nand objectives of Congress.” Arizona v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"803270\"><a href=\"/opinion/803270/arizona-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2501\n\n(2012) (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But as\n\nthe majority presents it here, we are deciding whether New Mexico’s\n\nrule—which, as a rule of ethics, Congress has authorized its application by\n\nenacting the McDade Amendment—stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\n\nand execution of the federal grand-jury subpoena standard as announced by\n\njudicial decision. Majority Op. 66–67 (discussing grand-jury subpoena standard\n\nannounced in R. Enterprises). Thus, the federal interest here is one of judicial\n\nmaking, and Congress has seen fit to expressly authorize the conflict.\n\n      The majority relies heavily on the Grand Jury Clause to ground its\n\npreemption analysis in some constitutional text. Although there was no mention\n\nof grand juries in the original Constitution, the Fifth Amendment reads, “No\n\nperson shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless\n\non a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.” This guarantee “confer[s] a\n\n\n\n\nClause as being inconsistent with the protections of the Grand Jury Clause.\n\n                                         13\n\fright not to be tried (in the pertinent sense) when there is no grand jury\n\nindictment.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v.

[T]he constitution protect[s] every\n\none from being prosecuted, without the intervention of a grand jury, for any crime\n\nwhich is subject by law to an infamous punishment.”). The Supreme Court,\n\nhowever, has limited the Grand Jury Clause’s reach by, for one, not compelling\n\nits application to the states through the Due Process Clause. See generally\n\nHurtado v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91054\"><a href=\"/opinion/91054/hurtado-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1884); see also Jerold H. Israel, Free-\n\nStanding Due Process and Criminal Procedure: The Supreme Court’s Search for\n\nInterpretive Guidelines, 45 St. Louis U. L.J. 303, 385 (2001) (“Of the specific\n\nguarantees aimed at the criminal justice process, only the Fifth Amendment\n\nrequirement of prosecution by indictment or presentment quite clearly will not be\n\nincorporated [into the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process guarantees].”).\n\n      The majority’s conclusion that the standard adopted in R. Enterprises is\n\nmandated by the Grand Jury Clause (thus, taking on constitutional supremacy)\n\nreads too much into the Supreme Court’s decision. The Court clearly defined its\n\ntask: “[T]he focus of our inquiry is the limit imposed on a grand jury by Federal\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 17(c).” R. Enters., 498 U.S. at 299 (“‘[Rule 17(c)]\n\nprovides that the court on motion made promptly may quash or modify the\n\n                                          14\n\fsubpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.’”). Because\n\n“reasonable[ness] depends on the context,” id., “[t]o the extent that Rule 17(c)\n\nimposes some reasonableness limitation on grand jury subpoenas . . . [the\n\nCourt’s] task is to define it.” Id. at 300. The Court then rejected the Nixon\n\nstandard, applying to trial subpoenas, and adopted the following standard:\n\n“[W]here . . . a subpoena is challenged on relevancy grounds, the motion to quash\n\nmust be denied unless the district court determines that there is no reasonable\n\npossibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce\n\ninformation relevant to the general subject of the grand jury’s investigation.” Id.\n\nat 301. That this standard is of constitutional significance—as opposed to federal\n\ngrand juries generally—goes too far. 10\n\n      Having concluded the invocation of the Grand Jury Clause is illusory, I\n\nreturn to the majority’s preemption finding. Although the Supreme Court has\n\napproved of the doctrine of obstacle preemption (or frustration-of-purpose\n\n      10\n         And it is generally understood that Congress controls the Supreme\nCourt’s rulemaking authority to promulgate rules of federal criminal procedure.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2072(a). Indeed, Congress has regulated grand-jury practice and\nprocedure through amendments to the federal rules. From 2001 to 2004, Congress\nexpanded the disclosure provisions in Rule 6(e) three times. See USA PATRIOT\nAct, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272, 279–80 (2001); Homeland Security Act of\n2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, 2256–57 (2002); Intelligence Reform and\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-458, 118 Stat. 3638, 3760 (2004).\nOf course, this discussion only has significance if New Mexico’s rule is deemed\nto be “procedural” in form—that is, it is a rule of procedure infringing upon the\nfederal rules. But, as the majority concedes, that is not the case here. Following\nColorado Supreme Court II’s framework, New Mexico’s rule is clearly one\ngoverning ethics.\n\n                                          15\n\fpreemption), see Crosby v.

See, e.g., R.\n\nEnters., 498 U.S. at 297 (noting grand jury’s “unique role in our criminal justice\n\nsystem”). But the grand jury’s unique role does not mean federal grand juries are\n\nimmune from congressional regulation absent some constitutional directive\n\nstating otherwise. Majority Op. 68 (citing In re Grand Jury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739910\"><a href=\"/opinion/739910/in-re-grand-jury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1073\n\n(3d Cir. 1997) (“Just as grand juries must operate within the confines of the\n\nConstitution, so too must they comply with the limitations imposed on them by\n\nCongress (as long as those limitations are not unconstitutional).”). Regulation of\n\ngrand juries via a federal statute, of course, is precisely that. The majority does\n\nnot hold that Congress lacks the power to say federal prosecutors in the grand\n\njury context are bound by standards mirroring New Mexico’s. That it did so more\n\n                                          17\n\findirectly—but still expressly, by a general reference to ethics rules—makes no\n\ndifference. In short, the question of whether the McDade Amendment authorizes\n\na rule’s application as ethical in no way depends on whether that rule’s\n\napplication to federal prosecutors may have the effect of changing their conduct.\n\nTo the contrary, Colorado Supreme Court II and the statute’s plain meaning make\n\nclear that any obstacle created by state law here exists pursuant to Congress’s\n\nexpress intent. 12\n\n                                II.
