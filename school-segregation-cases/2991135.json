Oberg v. Pa. Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (“Oberg II”),\n\n745 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 2014).                      In addition to administering\n\nstate-funded grant and scholarship programs on behalf of the\n\nCommonwealth, PHEAA conducts nationwide lending, servicing, and\n\nguaranteeing           activities,    and       it    “now    constitutes    one   of   the\n\nnation’s largest providers of student financial aid services.”\n\nId. at 138.\n\n       Dr.    Jon      H.   Oberg   brought          this    action   against   PHEAA   and\n\nother private and state-created student-loan entities under the\n\nFalse Claims Act (“FCA”), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-33, alleging that\n\nfrom       2002    through    2006,       the    defendants       fraudulently     claimed\n\nhundreds          of    millions     of     dollars          in   federal   student-loan\n\ninterest-subsidy payments to which they were not entitled.                              See\n\nOberg II, 745 F.3d at 135.                  As this case has proceeded up and\n\ndown the appeals ladder, 1 the other defendants have settled or\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       See United States ex rel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ.\nStudent Loan Corp. (“Oberg I”), 681 F.3d 575 (4th Cir. 2012);\nUnited States ex rel. Oberg v. Pa. Higher Educ. Assistance\nAgency (“Oberg II”), 745 F.3d 131 (4th Cir. 2014).\n\n\n                                                3\n\fwere    dismissed       from    the     case,        and    PHEAA       is    now    the    sole\n\nremaining defendant.\n\n       The only issue in this appeal is whether PHEAA qualifies as\n\nan “arm of the state” or “alter ego” of Pennsylvania such that\n\nit cannot be sued under the FCA.                       See Vermont Agency of Nat.\n\nRes. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 787-88\n\n(2000).     We conclude that PHEAA is not an arm of Pennsylvania,\n\nand we therefore reverse the district court’s order granting\n\nsummary    judgment       in    favor      of       PHEAA    and    remand         for    further\n\nproceedings on the merits of Oberg’s FCA claims against PHEAA.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       The FCA imposes civil liability on “any person” who makes\n\nor presents a false claim for payment to the federal government.\n\n31    U.S.C.     §    3729(a)(1).          Corporations,           including         municipal\n\ncorporations like cities and counties, are “persons” under the\n\nFCA, see Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U.S.\n\n119, 126-27, 134 (2003), but states and state agencies are not,\n\nsee    Vermont       Agency    of   Nat.    Res.,       529      U.S.    at    787-88.        To\n\ndetermine      whether    PHEAA     falls       into       the   former       or    the    latter\n\ncategory, we apply “the arm-of-the-state analysis used in the\n\nEleventh Amendment context.”                    Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 135.                    If\n\nPHEAA qualifies as an “arm” or “alter ego” of Pennsylvania, then\n\nit is not a “person” subject to liability under the FCA.                                     See\n\nUnited States ex rel. Oberg v. Ky. Higher Educ. Student Loan\n\n                                                4\n\fCorp. (“Oberg I”), 681 F.3d 575, 580 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      We    evaluate        four   non-exclusive       factors       when   considering\n\nwhether     a   state-created           entity     functions   as     an    arm   of   its\n\ncreating state:\n\n           (1) whether any judgment against the entity as\n      defendant will be paid by the State . . . ;\n\n           (2) the degree of autonomy exercised by the\n      entity, including such circumstances as who appoints\n      the entity’s directors or officers, who funds the\n      entity, and whether the State retains a veto over the\n      entity’s actions;\n\n           (3) whether the entity is involved with state\n      concerns   as   distinct   from non-state concerns,\n      including local concerns; and\n\n           (4) how the entity is treated under state law,\n      such as whether the entity’s relationship with the\n      State is sufficiently close to make the entity an arm\n      of the State.\n\nId.   (quoting       S.C.    Dep’t      of   Disabilities      &    Special   Needs     v.\n\nHoover Universal, Inc., 535 F.3d 300, 303 (4th Cir. 2008)).\n\n      Although       the    focus       of   the   first    factor    is    whether    the\n\n“primary legal liability” for a judgment will fall on the state,\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 428 (1997)\n\n(emphasis added), the practical effect on the state treasury of\n\na judgment against the entity must also be considered.                             “Where\n\nan agency is so structured that, as a practical matter, if the\n\nagency     is   to   survive,       a    judgment    must    expend    itself     against\n\nstate treasuries,” Hess v. Port Auth. Trans–Hudson Corp., 513\n\n\n                                              5\n\fU.S.   30,     50   (1994)     (alteration      omitted),    the     agency      will   be\n\nfound to be an arm of the state, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137;\n\nCash v. Granville Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 242 F.3d 219, 223 (4th\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n       “[I]f    the    State    treasury       will   be   called    upon   to    pay    a\n\njudgment against a governmental entity, the [entity is an arm of\n\nits    creating       state],      and   consideration      of    any   other     factor\n\nbecomes unnecessary.”               Cash, 242 F.3d at 223.              If the state\n\ntreasury will not be liable for a judgment rendered against the\n\nentity, we must consider the remaining factors, which focus on\n\nthe nature of the relationship between the state and the entity\n\nit    created.        See    id.    at   224;    accord     Lee-Thomas      v.    Prince\n\nGeorge’s Cty. Pub. Sch., 666 F.3d 244, 248 n.5 (4th Cir. 2012).\n\n       The purpose of the arm-of-state inquiry is to distinguish\n\narms    or     alter     egos       of   the    state      from     “mere     political\n\nsubdivisions of [the] State such as counties or municipalities,”\n\nwhich, though created by the state, operate independently and do\n\nnot share the state’s immunity.                   Kitchen v. Upshaw, 286 F.3d\n\n179, 184 (4th Cir. 2002); see Mt. Healthy Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n\n429 U.S. 274, 280 (1977) (“The issue here thus turns on whether\n\nthe Mt. Healthy Board of Education is to be treated as an arm of\n\nthe State partaking of the State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity,\n\nor is instead to be treated as a municipal corporation or other\n\npolitical subdivision to which the Eleventh Amendment does not\n\n                                            6\n\fextend.”).        Although we must consider “the provisions of state\n\nlaw that define the agency’s character,” Regents, 519 U.S. at\n\n429 n.5, “[u]ltimately . . . , the question whether a particular\n\nstate agency has the same kind of independent status as a county\n\nor is instead an arm of the State, and therefore one of the\n\nUnited States within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, is a\n\nquestion     of     federal     law,”        id.    (internal         quotation      marks\n\nomitted).\n\n     In    our     first   opinion      in       this   case,    we    held    that    the\n\ndistrict court erred by concluding that PHEAA was a state agency\n\nand dismissing Oberg’s complaint without applying the arm-of-\n\nstate analysis.       See Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 581.                    On remand, the\n\ndistrict     court    applied    the     arm-of-state           analysis      and    again\n\ngranted the motion to dismiss, concluding that PHEAA was not a\n\nperson within the meaning of the FCA.\n\n     Oberg again appealed, and we again held that the district\n\ncourt erred by dismissing the claims against PHEAA.                           See Oberg\n\nII, 745 F.3d at 140-41.           Considering the arm-of-state issue in\n\nlight of the statutes governing PHEAA’s operation and the facts\n\nalleged in Oberg’s complaint, we held in Oberg II that Oberg had\n\nplausibly alleged that PHEAA was not an arm of the state but was\n\ninstead a “person” subject to suit under the FCA.                       See id.\n\n     We first concluded that Pennsylvania was “neither legally\n\nnor functionally liable for any judgment against PHEAA.”                            Id. at\n\n                                             7\n\f138.     PHEAA was not legally liable because “state law expressly\n\nprovides that obligations of PHEAA shall not be binding on the\n\nState,” id. (internal alterations omitted), and requires PHEAA’s\n\ndebts to be paid from “‘moneys . . . of the corporation,’” id.\n\n(quoting 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3)).                    As to practical or functional\n\nliability,       PHEAA       argued      that       Pennsylvania       was      functionally\n\nliable     for     a     judgment      against        PHEAA     because         Pennsylvania\n\nstatutes       require    PHEAA     to    deposit      its     commercially        generated\n\nrevenues with the state Treasury and require the Treasurer’s\n\napproval of any payment from state Treasury funds.                              We rejected\n\nthat argument, however, given that the statute requiring the\n\ndeposit    also     explicitly        granted        control    over      those    funds     to\n\nPHEAA,     not    the     Treasurer,       and       the     funds    were      held    in    a\n\nsegregated       account      within     the    Treasury.           See   id.     at   138-39.\n\nBecause    PHEAA       had    control     over       “substantial         ‘moneys’     [that]\n\nderive exclusively from its own operations,” id. at 138, “any\n\njudgment in this case [would be paid] with [PHEAA’s] own moneys\n\nfrom     its     segregated      fund,”        id.    at     139,    and     we    therefore\n\nconcluded that Pennsylvania would not be functionally liable for\n\nany judgment against PHEAA.                And because there was no functional\n\nor legal liability, we held that the first arm-of-state factor\n\nweighed “heavily against holding that PHEAA is an arm of the\n\nstate.”    Id.\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f     As to the second arm-of-state factor, we noted that the\n\nindicia of autonomy reflected in the statutory framework and the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint pointed in both directions.                  The\n\ncomposition of PHEAA’s board (gubernatorial appointees and state\n\nlegislators) weighed in favor of arm-of-state status, as did the\n\nstatutory requirement that the Governor approve any PHEAA bond\n\nissues   and    the   fact   that   PHEAA’s   activities   were   subject    to\n\naudit by the Commonwealth Auditor General.                 See id. at 139.\n\nNonetheless, other facts “strongly suggest[ed] that PHEAA is not\n\nan arm of the state,” including PHEAA’s financial independence,\n\nits control over its revenues deposited with the state Treasury,\n\nand its corporate powers “to enter into contracts, sue and be\n\nsued, and purchase and sell property in its own name.”                      Id.\n\nDrawing all inferences from these facts in Oberg’s favor, as\n\nrequired given the procedural posture of the case, we concluded\n\nthat the autonomy factor “counsels against holding that PHEAA is\n\nan arm of the state.”        Id.\n\n     As to the third arm-of-state factor, we held it weighed in\n\nfavor    of    arm-of-state    status   because   PHEAA    was    focused    on\n\nimproving access to higher education, a matter of “legitimate\n\nstate concern.”       Id. at 140.     We rejected Oberg’s     argument that\n\nPHEAA was not primarily focused on state concerns, given PHEAA’s\n\nextensive      out-of-state     commercial     activities.        Noting    the\n\nallegation in Oberg’s complaint that one third of PHEAA’s 2005\n\n                                        9\n\fearnings came from out-of-state activities, we held that “it\n\ndoes    not      seem    plausible        that      by     2006       --   the    last    year\n\nencompassed       by    Dr.    Oberg’s       allegations         --   PHEAA’s     operations\n\nfocused primarily out of state.”                         Id.     And as to the fourth\n\nfactor, we concluded that state law treated PHEAA as a state\n\nagency, which also weighed in favor of treating PHEAA as an arm\n\nof the state.          See id.\n\n       Considering the factors together, we held that the district\n\ncourt erred by dismissing Oberg’s complaint:\n\n       [A]lthough the third and fourth factors suggest that\n       PHEAA is an arm of the state, the first (strongly) and\n       second (albeit less strongly) point in the opposite\n       direction.   At this early stage, construing the facts\n       in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we must\n       conclude that Dr. Oberg has alleged sufficient facts\n       that PHEAA is not an arm of the state, but rather a\n       “person” for FCA purposes.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).                         We vacated the district\n\ncourt’s order dismissing Oberg’s complaint, and we instructed\n\nthe district court on remand “to permit limited discovery on the\n\nquestion whether PHEAA [was] truly subject to sufficient state\n\ncontrol     to   render       it    a   part   of   the        state.”      Id.   at     140-41\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       On   remand,      the       parties     engaged     in     discovery,      and    PHEAA\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment on the arm-of-state issue.\n\nThe district court granted the motion, holding that all four\n\nfactors weighed in favor of arm-of-state status.

In the\n\ndistrict court’s view, this court’s contrary conclusion could\n\nnot    be        sustained    in    light       of   the      post-remand       “factual\n\ndevelopment” of the case.                 Id. at 497.              The district court\n\ntherefore held that because PHEAA was an arm of Pennsylvania, it\n\nwas not subject to suit under the FCA, and the court granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of PHEAA.\n\n                                              II.\n\n       Oberg      again     appeals,    arguing      that    the     district    court’s\n\nanalysis of the arm-of-state factors is inconsistent with our\n\nopinion in Oberg II and that its ultimate conclusions as to\n\nthose factors are not supported by the record.                       In Oberg’s view,\n\nthe Pennsylvania statutes governing PHEAA’s operation and the\n\nfactual information developed through discovery establish that\n\nPHEAA is not an arm of Pennsylvania.                    Oberg thus contends that\n\nthe district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof PHEAA and dismissing his action.\n\n       “We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying\n\nthe same standard as the trial court and without deference to\n\nthe trial court.”            Dash v. Mayweather, 731 F.3d 303, 310 (4th\n\nCir.   2013),       cert.    denied,    134     S.   Ct.    1761    (2014).      Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only if “there is no genuine dispute as\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fto any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as\n\na matter of law.”      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n     In this case, we see no material dispute about the relevant\n\nfacts    detailing      PHEAA’s    operations     and    relationship         with\n\nPennsylvania.     Instead, the dispute is over the legal effect of\n\nthe materially undisputed facts -- whether the relevant statutes\n\nand the facts developed during discovery establish that PHEAA is\n\nthe alter ego of Pennsylvania. 2          See Greene v. Barrett, 174 F.3d\n\n1136, 1139-40 (10th Cir. 1999) (“If there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial   fact   in    dispute,    we    determine    whether    the    district\n\ncourt    correctly     applied    the    substantive    law.”).         And   that\n\nquestion is a pure question of law reviewed de novo.                See United\n\nStates ex rel. Lesinski v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 739 F.3d\n\n598, 602 (11th Cir.) (“[W]hether an entity constitutes an arm of\n\nthe state [and therefore not a “person” under the FCA] . . . is\n\na question of law subject to de novo review.”), cert. denied,\n\n\n     2 While Oberg argues that the evidence establishes that\nPHEAA is not an arm of Pennsylvania, he also suggests that arm-\nof-state status is a question of fact to be resolved by a jury.\nWe disagree.    Although we held in Oberg II that whether a\ndefendant is a “person” is an element of an FCA plaintiff’s\ncase, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 136, we nonetheless agree with\nPHEAA that personhood and arm-of-state status nonetheless remain\nlegal issues to be resolved by the court.    Cf. Farwell v. Un,\n902 F.2d 282, 288 (4th Cir. 1990) (although negligence plaintiff\n“must prove that defendant owed plaintiff a duty, breached that\nduty, and that the breach proximately caused the claimed\ninjury[,] . . . . whether and in what form any legal duty exists\nis a question of law for the courts”).\n\n\n                                         12\n\f134 S. Ct. 2312 (2014); cf. Hutto v. South Carolina Ret. Sys.,\n\n773 F.3d 536, 542 (4th Cir. 2014) (“Whether an action is barred\n\nby the Eleventh Amendment is a question of law that we review de\n\nnovo.”).     We will summarize the statutes and evidence governing\n\nPHEAA’s    authority        and     operations           before    turning      to   Oberg’s\n\nchallenges to the district court’s decision.\n\n                                              III.\n\n     PHEAA      was       created       as    “a       body   corporate       and    politic\n\nconstituting          a       public              corporation           and      government\n\ninstrumentality.”          24 Pa. Stat. § 5101.                PHEAA has the power to\n\nsue and be sued; enter into contracts; and own, encumber, and\n\ndispose of real and personal property.                        See id. § 5104(3); Oberg\n\nII, 745 F.3d at 139.              During the time period relevant to this\n\nappeal, PHEAA was governed by a twenty-member board of directors\n\ncomposed   of    the       Secretary         of    Education;      three      gubernatorial\n\nappointees;     eight       members          of    the    Senate    appointed        by    the\n\nSenate’s     president;           and    eight         members     of     the    House      of\n\nRepresentatives appointed by the Speaker of the House.                               See 24\n\nPa. Stat. § 5103(a) (2006). 3                Board members may be removed by the\n\nofficial who appointed them.                  See Pa. Const. art. VI, § 7                 (“All\n\ncivil officers shall hold their offices on the condition that\n\n     3 In 2010, 24 Pa. Stat. § 5103 was repealed and a revised\nversion of it was recodified at 71 Pa. Stat. § 111.2.       The\nchanges to the composition of PHEAA’s board are not relevant to\nthe disposition of this appeal.\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fthey    behave     themselves       well    while       in    office,       and     shall    be\n\nremoved       on   conviction       of   misbehavior          in   office      or    of     any\n\ninfamous crime.           Appointed civil officers, other than judges of\n\nthe courts of record, may be removed at the pleasure of the\n\npower    by    which   they   shall      have     been       appointed.”);         Burger    v.\n\nSchool Bd., 923 A.2d 1155, 1162 (Pa. 2007) (“[A]rticle VI, § 7\n\nof]    the    Constitution      does     not     vest    in    the       appointing       power\n\nunfettered discretion to remove.                 Instead, valid removal depends\n\nupon the officer behaving in a manner not befitting the trust\n\nplaced in him by the appointing authority.”).\n\n       PHEAA’s     purpose     is     “to   improve          the   higher      educational\n\nopportunities        of    [Pennsylvania]         residents          .     .   .    who     are\n\nattending approved institutions of higher education . . . by\n\nassisting them in meeting their expenses of higher education.”\n\n24 Pa. Stat. § 5102.          To further its statutory purpose, PHEAA is\n\nauthorized to issue, purchase, service, and guarantee student\n\nloans.       See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104.\n\n       PHEAA is statutorily authorized to “borrow moneys by making\n\nand issuing notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness of\n\nthe agency . . . for the purposes of purchasing, making or\n\nguaranteeing loans.”          Id. § 5104(3).             The Governor must approve\n\nall debt issuances, see id., and the General Assembly has capped\n\nthe total amount of debt that PHEAA may incur, see 24 Pa. Stat.\n\n§ 5105.1(a.1).         Under state law, PHEAA bears sole responsibility\n\n                                            14\n\ffor   its    bonds     and    other      debts.         See    id.   §   5104(3)      (“[N]o\n\nobligation of [PHEAA] shall be a debt of the State and [PHEAA]\n\nshall have no power to pledge the credit or taxing power of the\n\nState nor to make its debts payable out of any moneys except\n\nthose of the corporation.”).                   Because the Pennsylvania General\n\nAssembly has determined that PHEAA is performing an “essential\n\ngovernmental        function,”       PHEAA      bonds    are    generally       free    from\n\ntaxation.      24 Pa. Stat. § 5105.6.\n\n      As     noted,    PHEAA       is    now    “one     of    the   nation’s      largest\n\nproviders of student financial aid services.”                            Oberg II, 745\n\nF.3d at 138.           During the time period relevant to this case,\n\nPHEAA’s commercial activity -- much of it conducted under the\n\ntrade       names     “American          Education       Services”       and     “FedLoan\n\nServicing” -- included issuing loans to Pennsylvania students,\n\nservicing loans for non-Pennsylvania students, and guaranteeing\n\nloans      issued     to     students      in       Delaware,    Georgia,       and     West\n\nVirginia.           PHEAA’s       2014   financial       statements      show    revenues\n\nexceeding $600 million, net revenues of more than $220 million,\n\nand unrestricted net assets of more than $700 million.                           See J.A.\n\n3147-48.        The        earnings      from       PHEAA’s     extensive      commercial\n\noperations      have       made    PHEAA   “financially         independent”       of    the\n\nCommonwealth, Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139, and PHEAA has received\n\nno appropriations to support its operations since 1988.\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f     PHEAA      administers     Pennsylvania’s        State    Grant     Program,\n\ndistributing appropriated funds as grants and scholarships to\n\nqualifying students.          PHEAA absorbs the costs of administering\n\nthe program, however, and disburses 100% of the appropriated\n\nfunds to students.        In 2005, PHEAA contributed $25 million of\n\nits earnings to supplement the State Grant Program, and it has\n\nmade contributions ranging from $45 – 75 million in many, but\n\nnot all, of the years since.\n\n     During the time period relevant to this case, PHEAA issued\n\nrevenue   bonds   to   fund    the    loans   it   originated,      repaying   the\n\nbonds    with   loan-repayment       revenues. 4     PHEAA    created    special-\n\npurpose   entities     incorporated      under     Delaware   law   to   formally\n\nissue the bonds and hold the student-loan receivables as assets.\n\nThese revenues are held in trust in accounts outside of the\n\nPennsylvania Treasury until the bonds are repaid or the release\n\nprovisions of the underlying documents are otherwise satisfied.\n\nThese trust accounts represent the bulk of PHEAA’s corporate\n\nwealth -- more than $6 billion of $8.6 billion total long term\n\nassets.    See J.A. 3148.\n\n\n\n\n     4 PHEAA stopped originating federally guaranteed student\nloans in 2008, “due to the global fiscal crisis.”      J.A. 327.\nSee J.A. 2440. As of July 1, 2010, the federal government took\nover as the originator of all federal student loans. See Health\nCare & Educ. Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, §§\n2201-2213, 124 Stat. 1029, 1074-81.\n\n\n                                        16\n\f      As to the other revenues generated by PHEAA’s commercial\n\nactivities, however, state law requires them to be deposited in\n\nthe   Pennsylvania      Treasury,     see    24   Pa.    Stat.    §     5104(3),   a\n\nrequirement similar to that applicable to other state agencies.\n\nPHEAA’s revenues on deposit with the state Treasury are held in\n\na   segregated   fund    known   as   the    “Educational        Loan   Assistance\n\nFund.”   24 Pa. Stat. § 5105.10.             Although the revenues are in\n\nthe custody of the state Treasurer, state law expressly vests\n\ncontrol over the revenues in PHEAA.               See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3)\n\n(requiring revenues earned through financial-services activities\n\nto be “deposited in the State Treasury,” but providing that the\n\nrevenues “shall be available\" to PHEAA and “may be utilized at\n\nthe discretion of the board of directors for carrying out any of\n\nthe corporate purposes of the agency”); id. § 5105.10 (“[A]ll\n\nappropriations    and    payments     made    into      the   [Educational     Loan\n\nAssistance Fund] are hereby appropriated to the board and may be\n\napplied and reapplied as the board shall direct and shall not be\n\nsubject to lapsing.”).\n\n      Much like funds invested in a mutual fund, PHEAA’s funds,\n\nthough separately accounted for, are commingled with the funds\n\nof other Commonwealth agencies for investment purposes.                     See 72\n\nPa. Stat. § 301.1 (generally authorizing Treasurer to invest\n\nfunds held in state depositories); see also J.A. 2474 (PHEAA\n\ntreasurer’s description of investment process: “It works kind of\n\n                                       17\n\flike       a     mutual      fund    .    .      .     taking          money    from       [separate\n\nCommonwealth agencies] and keeping track of what each of us has,\n\nbut putting it together and putting it into investment funds.”).\n\nThe    Treasury         Department        devises          and    executes      the    investment\n\nstrategy for the commingled funds.                           See 72 Pa. Stat. § 301.2;\n\nsee also J.A. 2796.\n\n       State law prohibits payment “from any of the funds of the\n\nState Treasury” without approval of the Treasurer.                                   72 Pa. Stat.\n\n§ 307.          To obtain approval for payment of funds in the custody\n\nof     the       Treasurer,       PHEAA        must     present          the    Treasurer          with\n\nrequisitions for payment.                      The Treasury Department audits the\n\nrequisitions            by    reviewing          “backup          documentation            such     as\n\ninvoices, contracts, [and] purchase orders” and “confirming the\n\nauthority for the payment (e.g., a valid supporting contract),\n\nand    a       match   between      the       amount    due       on    the    invoice      and     the\n\npayment request.”              J.A 673-74.             “If the requisitions appear to\n\nbe    lawful      and     correct,       the    Treasurer         issues       his    warrant      for\n\npayment.”          J.A.      673.        If    payment       is    approved,         the    Treasury\n\nDepartment         transfers        funds      to     PHEAA       electronically           or   sends\n\nPHEAA a check.               The checks are payable to the vendor and are\n\ndrawn on the state Treasury account and signed by the Treasurer.\n\n       For purposes of the “Commonwealth Attorneys Act,” 71 Pa.\n\nStat.      §§     732-101     –     732-506,         the    term       “Commonwealth         agency”\n\nincludes         “independent”           and     “executive”            agencies;          PHEAA     is\n\n                                                 18\n\fclassified as an independent agency, see id. § 732-102.                                  As is\n\nthe   case    with       other     Commonwealth           agencies,       if   the    Attorney\n\nGeneral provides PHEAA with a legal opinion, PHEAA must follow\n\nthe advice set out in the opinion.                    See id. § 702-204(a)(1).\n\n      While PHEAA has the authority to enter into contracts, it\n\nmust,     like      other     Commonwealth            agencies,         submit       contracts\n\ninvolving more than $20,000 for a “form and legality” review by\n\nthe Attorney General.              71 Pa. Stat. § 732-204(f).                      The review\n\ninvolves determining “whether the contract has all of the legal\n\nterms   that      the     Commonwealth         requires      and     no    terms      that    are\n\nprohibited”; whether “PHEAA has the authority to enter into the\n\ncontract”; and whether “the contract is constitutional under the\n\nState and Federal constitutions.”                     J.A. 713; see 71 Pa. Stat. §\n\n732-204(f) (requiring Attorney General to determine whether a\n\n“contract is in improper form, not statutorily authorized or\n\nunconstitutional”).           If an agency seeks to enter into a contract\n\nwith a party who owes money to the Commonwealth, the Attorney\n\nGeneral will not review the contract until the debt has been\n\nsatisfied.        See J.A. 2856.\n\n      PHEAA       is     authorized       to    pursue       student-loan            collection\n\nactions      independently,         see    24       Pa.    Stat.    §     5104.3,      but    the\n\nCommonwealth           Attorneys    Act     otherwise         requires         the    Attorney\n\nGeneral      to    represent        PHEAA       in    civil        litigation        absent     a\n\ndelegation of authority, see 71 Pa. Stat. § 732-204(c).                                 PHEAA’s\n\n                                               19\n\fstandard   practice       is   to    seek    such     delegations   in    all    non-\n\ncollection actions; PHEAA’s general counsel could not recall a\n\nrequest ever being denied.             A private law firm serves as counsel\n\nto   PHEAA’s    board.     The      Attorney    General’s     office     would   have\n\nconducted the form-and-legality review of the contract engaging\n\nthe law firm, but the decision to engage counsel did not require\n\na delegation from or other review by the Attorney General. 5\n\n      Pennsylvania law treats PHEAA as a typical state agency in\n\nother respects.          PHEAA is authorized to promulgate and enact\n\nregulations,      but     the       regulations        must   be    approved      by\n\nPennsylvania’s Regulatory Review Commission.                    See 71 Pa. Stat.\n\n§§ 745.3, 745.5.         PHEAA must report its year-end condition to\n\nthe Governor and the legislature.              See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5108.            It\n\nis subject to examination by the Commonwealth’s Auditor General,\n\nsee id., and was in fact the subject of a “special performance\n\naudit” in 2008.      J.A. 2312.

We held in Oberg II\n\nthat Pennsylvania was not legally liable, see id. at 138, and\n\nthat conclusion remains controlling in this appeal, see Everett\n\nv. Pitt Cty. Bd. of Educ., 788 F.3d 132, 142 (4th Cir. 2015)\n\n(explaining that under the “law of the case” doctrine, rulings\n\nby an appellate court on questions of law generally “must be\n\nfollowed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the\n\ntrial    court   or    on    a    later    appeal”     (internal    quotation       marks\n\nomitted)). 6     Our analysis in this appeal, therefore, will focus\n\non functional liability.\n\n\n\n\n     6 The law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply if “the prior\ndecision   was  clearly   erroneous  and  would   work  manifest\ninjustice.” TFWS, Inc. v. Franchot, 572 F.3d 186, 191 (4th Cir.\n2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).        Although PHEAA\nsuggests, almost in passing, that we erred by rejecting legal\nliability in Oberg II, see Brief of Respondent at 22 n.6, “[a]\nprior decision does not qualify for this . . . exception by\nbeing just maybe or probably wrong; it must strike us as wrong\nwith the force of a five-week-old, unrefrigerated dead fish.”\nTFWS, 572 F.3d at 194 (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted).   Given the previously discussed statutory provisions\ndisclaiming liability for PHEAA’s obligations and requiring\nPHEAA’s debts to be paid from moneys of the corporation, Oberg\nII’s no-legal-liability holding doesn’t strike us as wrong at\nall, much less dead-fish wrong.\n\n\n                                            22\n\f      The functional-liability analysis looks to whether, as a\n\npractical matter, a judgment against a state-created entity puts\n\nstate funds at risk, despite the fact that the state is not\n\nlegally liable for the judgment.                 Thus, functional liability\n\nwill be found “[w]here an agency is so structured that, as a\n\npractical matter, if the agency is to survive, a judgment must\n\nexpend itself against state treasuries.”                Hess, 513 U.S. at 50,\n\ncited in Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137; Ristow v. South Carolina\n\nPorts Auth., 58 F.3d 1051, 1054 (4th Cir. 1995) (finding Ports\n\nAuthority to be an arm of the state despite absence of legal\n\nliability because the state “provides whatever economic support\n\nis necessary over and above the Port Authority’s net revenues to\n\ninsure its continued vitality” and “takes back any portion of\n\nthe   Authority’s         net   revenues,      which,     in   its   legislative\n\njudgment,     is     not    necessary     or     desirable     for    the     Ports\n\nAuthority’s    operation”).         A    state   may    also   be    functionally\n\nliable if the funds available to pay any judgment effectively\n\nbelong to the state rather than the agency.\n\n      Applying these principles in Oberg II, we concluded that\n\nPennsylvania       was    not   functionally     liable    because    PHEAA    was\n\nstatutorily vested with control over the significant revenues\n\ngenerated by its extensive commercial activities, such that the\n\njudgment    would    be    paid   with   funds    belonging     to    PHEAA,   not\n\nPennsylvania.       See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139 (“[B]ecause state\n\n                                         23\n\flaw instructs that PHEAA would pay any judgment in this case\n\nwith its own moneys from its segregated fund, the first factor\n\nweighs    heavily      against    holding       that     PHEAA    is    an     arm    of    the\n\nstate.” (citation omitted)); id. at 138 (noting that “PHEAA’s\n\nsubstantial       ‘moneys’        derive          exclusively          from      its        own\n\noperations”).\n\n       The    district    court      rejected       that   conclusion          on    remand,\n\nhowever.        Believing     that    this    court’s      analysis       could       not    be\n\nsustained in light of the post-remand “factual development” in\n\nthe case, Oberg III, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 497, the district court\n\nheld   that     Pennsylvania      would      be    functionally         liable       for    any\n\njudgment entered against PHEAA.                   In the district court’s view,\n\nthe    fact    that    PHEAA’s    earnings         are   deposited       in     the    state\n\nTreasury, where they are commingled with other state funds and\n\ncannot be spent without approval of the Treasurer, showed that\n\n“the     Commonwealth       retains     [such]         significant        control          over\n\nPHEAA’s       assets    and    generated          revenue”       that    “[p]ractically\n\nspeaking, PHEAA’s money becomes State money.”                            Id.        We agree\n\nwith Oberg that the district court’s analysis on this point is\n\nlargely inconsistent with our decision in Oberg II.\n\n       Notwithstanding the district court’s “factual development”\n\nreference, its analysis did not depend on the evidence developed\n\nduring discovery, but instead turned on its understanding of the\n\ngeneral statutory framework governing PHEAA’s operation.                               As we\n\n                                           24\n\fhave already explained, however, this court in Oberg II rejected\n\nthe all-funds-are-state-funds argument.                       Instead, we held that\n\nbecause PHEAA was statutorily vested with control over the funds\n\non deposit with the state Treasury, PHEAA’s revenues remained\n\n“moneys     .   .   .     of     the   corporation”       despite       the        statutory\n\nprovisions relied on by the district court.                         Oberg II, 745 F.3d\n\nat 138 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Given      that    we      were   reviewing        the    granting       of    a   Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in Oberg II, our holding was based on\n\nan assumption that the control statutorily vested in PHEAA was\n\nin fact exercised by PHEAA.                 Nonetheless, because we held that\n\nOberg had plausibly alleged that PHEAA was not an arm of the\n\nstate,    we    necessarily       concluded      that    the    statutory          framework\n\ngoverning       PHEAA’s        operations    did    not,       in    and   of       itself,\n\nestablish a level of control sufficient to make PHEAA an arm of\n\nPennsylvania.       If the relevant statutory facts focused on by the\n\ndistrict court -- that PHEAA’s revenues are held in the state\n\nTreasury and cannot be used for payment without approval of the\n\nTreasurer -- were enough to establish functional liability even\n\nin the face of the PHEAA’s statutorily granted power over those\n\nrevenues, then we would have affirmed, not vacated, the district\n\ncourt’s arm-of-state conclusion in Oberg II.\n\n     In finding Pennsylvania functionally liable, the district\n\ncourt thus ignored the statutory facts that we found critical to\n\n                                            25\n\fthe issue -- PHEAA’s control over its significant independent\n\nfunds -- and gave the other relevant statutory facts a legal\n\neffect that we rejected in Oberg II.                 We therefore agree with\n\nOberg that the district court erred by analyzing the functional\n\nliability question in an manner inconsistent with the approach\n\ndictated by Oberg II.\n\n      This court, however, “review[s] judgments, not opinions.”\n\nCatawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v. City of Rock Hill, 501 F.3d 368,\n\n372 n.4 (4th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).                  Thus, even though the\n\ndistrict     court’s    analysis    of    the      state-treasury       factor      was\n\nerroneous,     reversal    would    not       be   required     if    the    evidence\n\ndeveloped through discovery shows a level of control actually\n\nexercised by the Commonwealth that changes the Oberg II calculus\n\nand establishes that Pennsylvania is functionally liable for a\n\njudgment    against    PHEAA.      See    Oberg     II,   745    F.3d       at    140-41\n\n(remanding for “limited discovery on the question whether PHEAA\n\nis truly subject to sufficient state control to render it a part\n\nof   the   state”   (emphasis    added;       internal    quotation         marks   and\n\nalterations omitted)).       We turn to that question now.\n\n                                         1.\n\n      Discovery       produced     substantial         evidence        of        PHEAA’s\n\nfinancial strength and independence.\n\n      PHEAA’s financial success, which has never really been in\n\ndispute, is clearly established in the record.                       For 2006, when\n\n                                         26\n\fthe last of the conduct alleged in Oberg’s complaint took place,\n\nPHEAA’s         financial      statements       show       gross     revenues    of    $416\n\nmillion, net revenues of $156 million, and total net assets of\n\n$498 million.           J.A 2573-74.           PHEAA’s 2014 financial statements\n\nshow impressive growth – gross revenues of $640 million, net\n\nrevenues of $222 million, with total net assets of $1 billion\n\nand unrestricted net assets of $709 million. 7                        See J.A. 3147-48.\n\nThe     evidence        thus    establishes         that    PHEAA     has    “substantial\n\nmoneys,” as we assumed to be true in Oberg II.                          745 F.3d at 138\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       PHEAA is statutorily vested with control over its funds on\n\ndeposit with the Treasury Department, and discovery confirmed\n\nthat       PHEAA   is    in     fact    exercising         control    over    its     funds.\n\nPHEAA’s control over fiscal matters is established, first and\n\nforemost, by PHEAA’s own officials.                        Timothy Guenther, PHEAA’s\n\ntreasurer, repeatedly testified in his deposition that financial\n\ndecisions were made by PHEAA’s Board of Directors.                                  Guenther\n\ntestified        that    PHEAA’s       board    approves      PHEAA’s       annual    budget\n\nbased      on    revenue       and   expenses       estimates      developed    by    PHEAA\n\nstaff; decides each year what portion (if any) of its earnings\n\n\n       7\n       As noted, PHEAA stopped originating student loans in 2008.\nDespite the loss of that line of business, PHEAA’s revenues have\nincreased dramatically. That increase is primarily attributable\nto a contract with the federal government to service federally\nissued student loans.\n\n\n                                               27\n\fwill     be   used    to    supplement        the      State        Grant     Program;       and\n\nestablishes PHEAA’s corporate investment policy.                              And as to the\n\nannual    report     of     its   major      financial        decisions         and    overall\n\nfinancial     condition       that     PHEAA      is    required         to    make    to    the\n\nGovernor and General Assembly, Guenther acknowledged that the\n\nfinancial     decisions       reflected        in      that    report         were    made    by\n\nPHEAA’s board.        See J.A. 2469.\n\n        The declaration of PHEAA’s chairman of the board likewise\n\nshows     that   PHEAA,       not    the      Commonwealth,              controls      PHEAA’s\n\noperations and its funds.               See J.A. 246 (“PHEAA’s Board makes\n\nsure that as much excess revenue, in light of PHEAA’s long-term\n\noperational      and       financial      requirements,             is    contributed        to\n\nprograms      and      financial       assistance             for     the          benefit   of\n\nPennsylvania students” (emphasis added)); J.A. 249 (“The Board\n\noversees PHEAA, makes the policy decisions for the direction of\n\n[the] agency, and tasks PHEAA’s executives and managers with\n\nimplementing        those    decisions       and    directions           on    a    day-to-day\n\nbasis.”);     id.    (“PHEAA’s       Board     reviews,        analyzes        and    approves\n\nPHEAA’s internal budget, which is proposed by management and\n\npresented to the Board.”); see also J.A. 2406 (“Briefing Book”\n\npreparing PHEAA CEO for appearance before legislative committee\n\nstating that “[t]he board is responsible for how we spend our\n\nmoney”).\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f     Specific      incidents       and       events     described       in     the    record\n\nprovide further evidence of PHEAA’s control.                         For example, when\n\nCommonwealth      revenues       fall    short    of     expectations,         it    is   not\n\nunusual for the Governor to ask state agencies to cut spending\n\nand return a portion of their budget to the General Assembly.\n\nThe record contains two gubernatorial letters requesting PHEAA’s\n\nassistance, and these letters distinguish PHEAA from other state\n\nagencies    and   make     it    clear    that     PHEAA      has     control    over     its\n\nbudget that other agencies do not.                     See J.A. 3118 (letter from\n\nGov. Corbett stating that he had “directed agencies under [his]\n\njurisdiction to freeze . . . spending” but was “ask[ing] that\n\n[PHEAA]    make   the     same    sacrifice       as    the     agencies     under     [his]\n\njurisdiction”      (emphasis      added));        J.A.    3120       (letter    from      Gov.\n\nRendell noting that he had “directed commonwealth agencies to\n\nplace     1.9%    of    their     discretionary           budgets       into    budgetary\n\nreserve”    but    “ask[ing]       [PHEAA]        to     make     the    same       spending\n\nreductions that our commonwealth agencies are making” (emphasis\n\nadded)).\n\n     In    addition,      in    2007,    PHEAA     settled       a    dispute    with     the\n\nDepartment of Education related to the interest-subsidy issue\n\nraised in Oberg’s complaint for $11.3 million.                               According to\n\nPHEAA’s treasurer, PHEAA paid the Department of Education with\n\nloan-repayment         funds    held    in    trust      in   accounts       outside      the\n\nPennsylvania Treasury.            PHEAA also settled a dispute with the\n\n                                             29\n\fIRS for $12.3 million, and a portion of the IRS settlement was\n\nalso paid      from    assets     held    in    trust.       See   J.A.    2480.      The\n\nAttorney      General    would     have    conducted         the   form-and-legality\n\nreview of the settlements, but it otherwise had no involvement\n\nin    the    substantive       decision    to    settle      the   disputes      or   the\n\nnegotiation of the settlement terms.                     See J.A. 2845, 2847-48.\n\nThe    General       Assembly      was     not     required        to     approve     the\n\nsettlements, and it did not appropriate funds to replace those\n\nspent by PHEAA.         In our view, PHEAA’s actions in settling the\n\ndisputes demonstrates PHEAA’s control over its funds and its\n\nfinancial independence from the Commonwealth.                      And the fact that\n\nthe settlements were paid with a portion of the $6 billion held\n\nin trust outside the state Treasury is additional evidence of\n\nPHEAA’s ability to fund a judgment without the use of state\n\nfunds.\n\n       PHEAA’s    creation      and   support     of     the   Pennsylvania        Higher\n\nEducation Foundation (“PHEF”) also provides compelling evidence\n\nof PHEAA’s financial independence and control. 8                        Although PHEAA\n\nitself is authorized to solicit and receive private donations,\n\nsee 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3) & (8); id. § 5106, PHEAA officials\n\nbelieved      that    “‘many    private    donors      are     reluctant    to     donate\n\nfunds to a government agency,’” 2008 Auditor General’s Report at\n\n       8   PHEF has been inactive since 2009.\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f74,   Exhibit         1    to       Oberg’s   Opposition     to    PHEAA’s   Motion     for\n\nSummary Judgment (“2008 Auditor General’s Report”). 9                         PHEAA thus\n\ncreated          PHEF,          a      one-employee, 10      tax-exempt       charitable\n\norganization, for the purpose of soliciting private corporate\n\ndonations.        PHEAA provided the funds and administrative services\n\nnecessary for PHEF’s operation.                       From 2001 through 2007, PHEAA\n\nprovided PHEF with more than $86 million in cash and donated\n\nservices.         Over that same period, PHEF collected $11.1 million\n\nin private donations.                  See 2008 Auditor General’s Report at 75.\n\nWhile PHEAA has the general authority “[t]o perform such . . .\n\nacts as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out effectively\n\nthe objects and purposes of the agency,” 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(7),\n\nPHEAA      had   no       specific      statutory      authority    to   create   or   make\n\ndonations to a charitable organization, see J.A. 2410 (“Briefing\n\nBook”      preparing        PHEAA       CEO   for     appearance    before   legislative\n\ncommittee        stating        that     there      was   “[n]o    express   legislative\n\nauthority” for PHEAA’s funding of PHEF).\n\n      In our view, the evidence outlined above establishes the\n\ncritical facts assumed in Oberg II when we rejected the claim of\n\n\n      9The parties included only a portion of this report in the\nJoint Appendix.\n\n      10PHEF’s single employee is its president and CEO.

See Burrus v. State Lottery Comm’n, 546\n\nF.3d   417,       420    (7th    Cir.    2008)      (“Because       the    Lottery       raises\n\nrevenue      on    its     own     account,         controls       and     funds    its     own\n\noperations,        and    does    not    expose      state      coffers     when     monetary\n\njudgments are rendered against it, we conclude that it is an\n\nentity financially independent from the state.”).                            As we discuss\n\nbelow, state law does impose some restrictions on PHEAA’s use of\n\nits funds, but those restrictions do not divest PHEAA of control\n\nover its funds or otherwise establish that the Commonwealth is\n\nfunctionally liable for a judgment against PHEAA.\n\n                                               2.\n\n       The   primary       way    the    Commonwealth        exercises       some        control\n\nover PHEAA’s funds is through the statutory requirements that\n\nPHEAA deposit its commercial revenues in the Treasury Department\n\nand the Treasurer approve any payment of funds held by Treasury.\n\n       To the extent that PHEAA continues to assert that these\n\nstatutory     provisions         establish       that     all    of      PHEAA’s    funds    on\n\ndeposit      in    the     state       Treasury       effectively         belong     to     the\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fCommonwealth, 11 that argument is foreclosed by Oberg II, which\n\nnecessarily concluded that these statutory requirements do not,\n\nin and of themselves, transform PHEAA funds into Commonwealth\n\nfunds.        See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 138; cf. Fitchik v. New Jersey\n\nTransit Rail Operations, Inc., 873 F.2d 655, 661 (3d Cir. 1989)\n\n(en banc) (“The [statutory] designation of the money as ‘public’\n\nsimply does not answer the question of who has dominion over the\n\nmoney     in      [state-created       entity’s]          accounts.”).          Indeed,\n\nPennsylvania law expressly recognizes that not all funds held by\n\nthe Treasurer actually belong to the Commonwealth.                          See 72 Pa.\n\nStat.     §     301   (requiring      Treasurer      to     deposit    in     specified\n\naccounts       “all     moneys   of   the        Commonwealth      received    by   it,\n\nincluding moneys not belonging to the Commonwealth but of which\n\nthe Treasury Department or the State Treasurer is custodian”\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n     PHEAA       also    contends,     however,      that    the    actual     payment-\n\napproval         process,        as    established           through        discovery,\n\n“significantly constrain[s]” its spending and signifies a level\n\n     11 In support of this argument, PHEAA points to the\ntestimony of PHEAA treasurer Timothy Guenther, who stated in his\ndeposition that “[a]ll PHEAA funds held in the Treasury are\nfunds of the Commonwealth.” J.A. 2447. To the extent Guenther\nasserts that the funds are Commonwealth funds simply because\nthey are deposited in the state Treasury, that argument is\nforeclosed by Oberg II. Moreover, whether PHEAA funds belong to\nthe Commonwealth for purposes of the arm-of-state analysis is\nultimately a question of federal law that cannot be established\nby a witness’s conclusory assertion of the ultimate legal issue.\n\n\n                                            33\n\fof    control   that    makes     the     Commonwealth        functionally        liable.\n\nBrief of Respondent at 18.           We disagree.\n\n       The Treasury Department’s review-and-approval process, as\n\ndescribed by the evidence in the record, is not particularly\n\ncomplicated.     PHEAA prepares and submits a payment request; the\n\nTreasury Department reviews the payment request and its “backup\n\ndocumentation     such     as     invoices,           receipts,    contracts,       [and]\n\npurchase     orders,”    to     confirm         the    existence     of     a    contract\n\nauthorizing payment and an invoice matching the payment request.\n\nJ.A 673.     If the review raises questions, the Department rejects\n\nthe   request   and     returns      it    to    PHEAA    for     resolution      of    the\n\nissues.      If the review shows the payment request “to be lawful\n\nand correct, the Treasurer issues his warrant for payment.”                             Id.\n\nWhen a check is required, the vendor is paid with a check drawn\n\non the state Treasury and signed by the Treasurer.\n\n       The   approval     process         clearly       reflects     some       level   of\n\nCommonwealth     control      over      PHEAA,    as     it   effectively        requires\n\nPHEAA to adopt certain book-keeping procedures if it wants its\n\nvendors to be paid.        The Treasury Department’s review, however,\n\nis not a substantive review.               The Department does not evaluate\n\nthe wisdom of the underlying contract or the reasonableness of\n\nthe agreed-upon price, but instead simply confirms that a valid\n\ncontract authorizes payment and that the payment amount sought\n\nmatches the amount agreed to in the contract.                             The approval\n\n                                           34\n\fprocess    thus      does     not     constrain     or    otherwise        interfere        with\n\nPHEAA’s statutory authority to make the substantive decisions\n\ncontrolling the use of its revenues.                     See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3)\n\n(PHEAA revenues held in the state Treasury “shall be available”\n\nto    PHEAA    and     “utilized       at    the    discretion        of    the     board    of\n\ndirectors for carrying out any of the corporate purposes of the\n\nagency”); id. § 5105.10 (deposits into PHEAA’s segregated state\n\nTreasury account “are hereby appropriated to the board and may\n\nbe applied and reapplied as the board shall direct”).                                   Indeed,\n\nthe   approval       process        doesn’t    even      commence        until     PHEAA    has\n\nexercised its discretion to enter into a contract or otherwise\n\ntake action that requires a payment to be made.\n\n       PHEAA,       however,        argues    that,       “[a]s      the        thousands    of\n\nexamples       of    requisition          questions      and     denials         produced     in\n\ndiscovery      clearly        show,    Treasury’s        review     is     no    mere    rubber\n\nstamp.”        Brief     of    Respondent      at   19.        In    PHEAA’s       view,    the\n\napproval       process      “is     not    ministerial      in      nature”       because    it\n\n“involves a comprehensive, multi-step process involving several\n\nlevels    of    submission,         substantive       review,       and    authorization.”\n\nBrief of Respondent at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe disagree.\n\n       Whether       the      review-and-approval          process         is     ministerial\n\ndepends on the nature of the review, not on the frequency with\n\nwhich the review identifies problems.                      And here, the undisputed\n\n                                              35\n\fevidence shows that Treasury Department officials simply check,\n\ncross-check, and confirm the information contained in contracts,\n\npurchase        orders,    and    invoices.         Complicated        contracts      may\n\nsometimes lead to lengthy email exchanges trying to unravel the\n\nagreed-upon pricing terms, but even then, the Department’s role\n\nis   simply      to    confirm    that    a    valid     contract      authorizes    the\n\npayment being sought in the amount being sought. 12\n\n      We recognize, of course, that by dictating the steps to be\n\nfollowed for payment to be made to a PHEAA vendor, the approval\n\nrequirement       places    some     not-insignificant          constraints     on    the\n\nmanner     in    which    PHEAA    pays    its     bills.       Dictating     specific\n\npayment     procedures,       however,        is   not   the    same    as    dictating\n\nspending        policy     and     priorities.            Because       the    Treasury\n\nDepartment’s          ministerial,       checklist-focused        approval      process\n\ndoes not substantively constrain PHEAA’s fiscal discretion, the\n\napproval        requirement       does     not,     in    and    of     itself,      give\n\n      12 When   arguing  that  the   approval   process  is  not\nministerial, PHEAA notes that “after receiving a $63 invoice\nfrom PHEAA’s outside counsel seeking reimbursement for a meal,\nTreasury demanded an itemized receipt from PHEAA and inquired\nwhether the meal included alcohol.”    Brief of Respondent at 19\nn.5.   Given that Pennsylvania’s reimbursement policy precludes\nreimbursement for alcoholic beverages and requires “[c]omplete\njustification” for reimbursement requests, see Commonwealth\nTravel Procedures Manual §§ 4.1, 7.1 (Nov. 1, 2011) (PDF file\nsaved as ECF opinion attachment), the Treasury Department simply\nasked PHEAA to provide the information necessary to show that\npayment was authorized.   We see no relevant difference between\nthat request and a request for PHEAA to provide the contract\nunderlying a given invoice.\n\n\n                                              36\n\fPennsylvania a level of control over PHEAA funds sufficient to\n\ntransform     PHEAA’s    independently           earned   revenues       into      money\n\nbelonging to the Commonwealth.\n\n       PHEAA also argues that Pennsylvania is functionally liable\n\nbecause PHEAA’s funds on deposit in the Treasury are commingled\n\nwith state funds and invested by the Treasurer.                        We disagree.\n\nThat PHEAA’s revenues were commingled with state revenues and\n\ninvested by the Treasurer were statutory facts before the court\n\nin Oberg II but were insufficient, standing alone, to establish\n\nfunctional     liability.        While     discovery      has    added       to    those\n\nstatutory facts and establishes that the Treasurer makes the\n\ndecisions    about     investing    these      commingled     funds,       we     do   not\n\nbelieve that adds much to the analysis.                      The commingling and\n\ninvesting -- a process that PHEAA’s own treasurer compared to an\n\nordinary mutual fund -- may reflect the Treasurer’s custodial\n\ncontrol over the funds on deposit, but it does not establish a\n\nlack   of    substantive    control      by      PHEAA.      That    is,     PHEAA      is\n\nstatutorily vested with the power to control its commercially\n\ngenerated revenues on deposit in the Treasury.                      The Treasurer’s\n\nconcurrent authority to use those funds to generate interest\n\ndoes   not   somehow    divest     PHEAA    of     control    over     its   funds      or\n\notherwise interfere with PHEAA’s exercise of substantive control\n\nover   its   funds.      Accordingly,         we   conclude     that    PHEAA’s        own\n\n“moneys,”    generated     through    PHEAA’s       commercial       activities        and\n\n                                         37\n\fheld in a segregated account, are not transformed into “moneys”\n\nof   the   Commonwealth       simply       because      they   are   commingled      with\n\nother state funds for investment purposes.\n\n       PHEAA also contends that it is “fiscally dependent” on the\n\nCommonwealth,       and   the   Commonwealth            is   therefore   functionally\n\nliable, because it must submit annual budget requests to obtain\n\nappropriations from the General Assembly, the legislature has\n\ncapped     the    total   amount      of    debt     PHEAA     can   incur,   and     the\n\nGovernor must approve all debt issuances.                       Brief of Respondent\n\nat 19.     Again, we disagree.\n\n       As the record establishes, PHEAA submits budget requests\n\nonly to receive the appropriated funds to be distributed under\n\nthe State Grant Program.           PHEAA is not required to submit budget\n\nrequests to gain access to its independently generated revenues,\n\nand the General Assembly does not take PHEAA’s revenues to fill\n\nholes in the Commonwealth’s budget.                      PHEAA’s participation in\n\nthe state budgeting process in its capacity as administrator of\n\nthe State Grant Program thus does not cast doubt on PHEAA’s\n\npower to control its extensive, independent funds, nor does it\n\notherwise make PHEAA fiscally dependent on Pennsylvania.\n\n       As to the statutory limit on PHEAA’s total debt and the\n\ngubernatorial-approval          requirement,         these     provisions     may    well\n\nmake     PHEAA     fiscally     dependent          on    Pennsylvania       for     state\n\naccounting       purposes.      See    Commonwealth’s          Comprehensive      Annual\n\n                                            38\n\fFinancial Report, J.A. 595-96 (treating PHEAA as a “component\n\nunit” of the Commonwealth’s “primary government” because “PHEAA\n\nis fiscally dependent, as the Governor must approve the issuance\n\nof   its     debt”).      For     purposes    of    the    arm-of-state       inquiry,\n\nhowever, we do not believe these restrictions suffice to make\n\nPennsylvania functionally liable for a judgment against PHEAA.\n\n      Preliminarily,        we    note   that      while        the    debt-limit    and\n\ngubernatorial-approval provisions do place some constraints on\n\nPHEAA’s business activities, nothing in the statutes directly\n\naddresses PHEAA’s control over its revenues, which is the key to\n\nthe functional liability question in this case.                        Moreover, these\n\nstatutory      requirements       obviously     have      not    been    obstacles       to\n\nPHEAA’s financial success, and there is no basis in the record\n\nfor us to conclude that Pennsylvania in the future would use\n\nthese      powers   to   shrink    PHEAA’s    operations         and    revenues    to    a\n\npoint where it could not withstand a judgment against it.                            See\n\nHess, 513 U.S. at 50.\n\n      In any event, while these statutory provisions do restrict\n\nPHEAA’s      financial     independence       to    some    degree,       Pennsylvania\n\nmunicipalities--which are subject to liability under the FCA--\n\nalso face similar requirements. 13                 These statutes thus provide\n\n\n      13See Pa.

And as outlined above, the\n\nevidence produced through discovery confirms that PHEAA is in\n\nfact exercising the control granted to it by statute and that\n\nsubstantive decisions about the use of its substantial revenues\n\nare made by PHEAA, not the Governor or the General Assembly.\n\nThis point is exemplified by PHEAA’s creation of PHEF and its\n\ndonation to PHEF of $86 million in cash and services goods, all\n\nwithout specific statutory authority.\n\n       Of    course,    PHEAA   is   subject       to   some   measure    of   state\n\ncontrol over its finances, including the gubernatorial-approval\n\nrequirement, the legislative cap on total debt, and the Treasury\n\npayment-approval requirement.               Oberg II held that those facts\n\ndid    not   outweigh    the    control    PHEAA    had   over    its   independent\n\nfunds, however, and the record contains no evidence that causes\n\nus to reach a different conclusion.                 The gubernatorial-approval\n\nrequirement      and    legislative        cap   may    theoretically      place   a\n\nceiling on PHEAA’s earning capacity at some as-yet unestablished\n\nlevel, but an income ceiling does not affect PHEAA’s right or\n\n                                           41\n\fability to control the revenues it actually earns.                           The Treasury\n\npayment-approval process, though not an entirely inconsequential\n\nburden, is nonetheless a purely ministerial process that does\n\nnot in any way restrict PHEAA’s authority to set policy and make\n\nall substantive decisions about where and how its funds are best\n\ndirected.       None of these facts, whether considered individually\n\nor     collectively,       materially       diminish        or    constrain        PHEAA’s\n\nsubstantive control (vested by law and exercised in fact) over\n\nits funds and financial decisions.\n\n       PHEAA, however, objects to any consideration of the extent\n\nof    its    corporate     wealth     and   its       ability    to   fund    a   judgment\n\nthrough its own resources, insisting that arm-of-state status\n\ncannot depend on whether the state-created entity happens to be\n\n“flush at a particular juncture.”                      Brief of Respondent at 25.\n\nPHEAA argues that for the first two decades of its existence, it\n\ndepended on state appropriations to fund its operations.                             PHEAA\n\ncontends that in those early years, “the Commonwealth would have\n\nbeen    on    the   hook   to   pay    a    judgment      against     PHEAA,”       and   it\n\ncontends that “[t]here is no principled basis for rescinding\n\nPHEAA’s status as an arm of the Commonwealth simply because it\n\nnow    enjoys       financial   success          by    discharging      its       statutory\n\nmission.”      Brief of Respondent at 26.               We disagree.\n\n       First, Oberg II requires us to consider PHEAA’s wealth and\n\nits ability to use its funds to pay a judgment.                        Those facts, as\n\n                                            42\n\fpreviously discussed, were the critical facts on which Oberg\n\nII’s functional-liability decision was grounded.                     Oberg II thus\n\nestablished     that      PHEAA’s   access      to   its   substantial     corporate\n\nwealth was relevant to the functional-liability question, and\n\nthat determination is a legal ruling that remains applicable in\n\nthis appeal.     See TFWS, Inc. v. Franchot, 572 F.3d 186, 191 (4th\n\nCir. 2009) (“The law of the case doctrine posits that when a\n\ncourt decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue\n\nto   govern   the    same    issues   in     subsequent     stages    in   the   same\n\ncase.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n      Moreover, even were we to ignore Oberg II’s focus on these\n\nfacts,   case       law    would    still       require    their     consideration.\n\nSpecifically, the Supreme Court’s decision in Hess establishes\n\nthat an agency’s access to independent funds is relevant to the\n\nfunctional-liability question.\n\n      In Hess, the Court explained that, “[w]here an agency is so\n\nstructured that, as a practical matter, if the agency is to\n\nsurvive, a judgment must expend itself against state treasuries,\n\ncommon sense and the rationale of the eleventh amendment require\n\nthat sovereign immunity attach to the agency.”                     Hess, 513 U.S.\n\nat 50 (internal quotation marks omitted).                     “There is no such\n\nrequirement where the agency is structured . . . to be self-\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\fsustaining.”       Id. 14    When determining whether the state-created\n\nentity was “structured” to be “self-sustaining,” the Hess Court\n\nconsidered the entity’s financial statements, which showed that\n\nthe entity “had over $2.8 billion in net assets and $534 million\n\nin its General Reserve Fund,” id. at 36 n.6, as well as the\n\nentity’s independent source of revenues, which “account[ed] for\n\nthe Authority’s secure financial position,” id. at 36.                   Although\n\nthe    creating    states     otherwise        exercised    a   not-insignificant\n\namount of control over the entity, see id. at 36-37, the Court\n\nheld in Hess that the entity was not entitled to share in the\n\nstates’       Eleventh      Amendment     immunity         given   the   entity’s\n\n“anticipated and actual financial independence,” id. at 49; see\n\nalso    id.   at   52    (“[T]he   Port    Authority       is   financially   self-\n\nsufficient; it generates its own revenues, and it pays its own\n\ndebts.      Requiring the Port Authority to answer in federal court\n\n. . . does not touch the concerns -- the States’ solvency and\n\ndignity -- that underpin the Eleventh Amendment.”).\n\n       In our view, the Court’s approach in Hess forecloses any\n\nargument that an entity’s independent financial resources and\n\nits ability to fund any judgments against it are not relevant to\n\nthe functional-liability inquiry.               PHEAA suggests, however, that\n\n       14\n        Although Hess involved an entity created by two states,\nwe have held that “the same general principles identified in\n[Hess] must also apply in the single state context.”    Gray v.\nLaws, 51 F.3d 426, 432 (4th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                          44\n\fHess’s focus on the financial circumstances of the state-created\n\nentity was subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court in Regents\n\nof the University of California v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425 (1997),\n\nwhich PHEAA contends held that the state’s “potential” liability\n\nwas the key factor in the arm-of-state inquiry.                               We disagree.\n\n     In    Regents,         the   question       was   whether        the       University    of\n\nCalifornia      was     an    arm    of    the    state     for      Eleventh          Amendment\n\npurposes.       Although there was no dispute that California was\n\nlegally liable for the University’s debts, see id. at 428, the\n\nNinth Circuit nonetheless concluded that the University was not\n\nan   arm   of     California        because       a    contractual             indemnification\n\nagreement       with    the       federal    government         would          have     relieved\n\nCalifornia of the financial consequences of a judgment in that\n\ncase,    see    id.         The   Supreme    Court     reversed.               Rejecting     “the\n\nnotion     that       the    presence       or    absence       of        a    third    party’s\n\nundertaking to indemnify the agency should determine whether it\n\nis the kind of entity that should be treated as an arm of the\n\nState,” id. at 431, the Supreme Court held that “with respect to\n\nthe underlying Eleventh Amendment question, it is the entity’s\n\npotential legal liability, rather than its ability or inability\n\nto require a third party to reimburse it, or to discharge the\n\nliability       in     the    first       instance,      that        is       relevant,”     id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\f         The Regents Court thus held that if the state is legally\n\nliable        for    a   judgment      against        the      state-created           entity,      the\n\nentity is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and does not\n\nlose     that       immunity     by    virtue       of    an     indemnity        agreement      that\n\nultimately shifts the state’s loss to a third party.                                    See id. at\n\n430-31; see also Cash, 242 F.3d at 221-22 n.1 (“[I]n Regents,\n\nthe Court held that the fact that a judgment against the State\n\nwould be covered by the voluntary indemnification agreement of a\n\nthird party did not strip away the State’s Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity        because        the    State    still       bore     the        legal   risk    of    an\n\nadverse judgment.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).                                       Because\n\nRegents         addressed       Hess     and    built          on    Hess’s       analysis       when\n\nreaching         its     own    ruling,       see    Regents,            519    U.S.    at    430-31,\n\nRegents’ focus on legal liability cannot somehow be understood\n\nas   a        silent     rejection      of     the       heart      of    Hess’s       analysis     of\n\nfunctional liability. 15\n\n\n         15\n       This court has concluded that Regents’ use of “potential”\nliability, Regents, 519 U.S. at 431, requires us to consider the\neffect of a “hypothetical” judgment that exceeds the entity’s\nrevenues.   See Hutto v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 773 F.3d 536, 545 (4th\nCir. 2014) (“[T]he proper inquiry is not whether the state\ntreasury   would   be  liable   in  this   case,  but   whether,\nhypothetically speaking, the state treasury would be subject to\npotential legal liability if the [state-created entity] did not\nhave the money to cover the judgment.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).   We have already held that the Commonwealth is not\nlegally liable for a judgment against PHEAA. See Oberg II, 745\nF.3d at 138. And for the reasons previously discussed, PHEAA’s\ncontrol over significant cash reserves means there is little\n(Continued)\n                                                 46\n\f     In       sum,     PHEAA    is    engaged       in     nationwide,        commercial\n\nfinancial-aid activities that bring in hundreds of millions of\n\ndollars    in    net    revenues      every    year      and   have    allowed    it    to\n\naccumulate      more    than    one   billion    dollars       in     net   assets,    and\n\nPHEAA has substantive control over those independent funds.                              A\n\njudgment in this case would thus be paid with PHEAA funds, not\n\nfunds belonging to the Commonwealth.                     And given PHEAA’s control\n\nover its sizeable corporate wealth, there is little likelihood\n\nthat a judgment against PHEAA, even one that exceeds its current\n\nrevenues, would imperil its survival such that the Commonwealth\n\nwould     effectively      be    required      to     swoop     in     with   financial\n\nsupport. 16     Accordingly,     in    light    of       PHEAA’s     “anticipated      and\n\n\n\n\nlikelihood that the Commonwealth’s help would be required to\nsatisfy the hypothetical judgment.    To the extent that PHEAA\nsuggests that Hutto’s “hypothetical” inquiry requires us to\nimagine not only a judgment that exceeds PHEAA’s revenues, but\nalso that PHEAA’s accumulated cash and other assets have\nvanished, that proposition is not only an over-reading of Hutto,\nbut also inconsistent with Hess, which considered real, not\nimaginary, financial information when rejecting arm-of-state\nstatus. See Hess, 513 U.S. at 36.\n\n     16 Although PHEAA’s chairman stated in his declaration that\nthe Commonwealth “would have no choice but to appropriate money”\nfor PHEAA if a “significant judgment” were entered against it,\nJ.A. 248, the chairman did not identify any facts supporting his\nopinion.   Cf. Williams v. Giant Food, Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 433\n(4th Cir. 2004) (explaining that a “mere[] . . . self-serving\nopinion . . . cannot, absent objective corroboration, defeat\nsummary judgment”).   Moreover, the record evidence that shines\nlight on this issue points to the opposite conclusion, given\nthat the Commonwealth did not replenish PHEAA’s coffers after it\n(Continued)\n                                          47\n\factual     financial    independence,”        Hess,    513     U.S.    at   49,    the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\n\nfunctionally liable for a judgment against PHEAA.                       And because\n\nPennsylvania    is     neither   legally      nor    functionally      liable,     the\n\nstate-treasury factor therefore “weighs heavily against holding\n\nthat PHEAA is an arm of the state.”                 Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139;\n\nsee Cash, 242 F.3d at 225 (explaining that if the state treasury\n\nwill not be affected by a judgment, that fact weighs against\n\narm-of-state status).\n\n                                  B.    Autonomy\n\n     The    second     arm-of-state      factor     requires    us    to    determine\n\n“the degree of autonomy exercised by the entity, including such\n\ncircumstances     as     who     appoints     the     entity’s        directors    or\n\nofficers, who funds the entity, and whether the State retains a\n\nveto over the entity’s actions.”                   Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 580\n\n(internal    quotation     marks       omitted).      “Also     relevant      to   the\n\nautonomy inquiry is the determination whether an entity has the\n\nability to contract, sue and be sued, and purchase and sell\n\n\n\n\npaid millions of dollars to settle the disputes with the\nDepartment of Education and the IRS, nor did the Commonwealth\nprovide extra funds when PHEAA had a $27-million operating loss\nin 2008.   Under these circumstances, the chairman’s unsupported\nopinion about actions the Commonwealth might take cannot\nestablish functional liability.     Cf. Cash, 242 F.3d at 225\n(speculative effect on state treasury insufficient to establish\nfunctional liability).\n\n\n                                         48\n\fproperty, and whether it is represented in legal matters by the\n\nstate attorney general.”           Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137 (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n                                       1.\n\n      In Oberg II, we held that while the composition of PHEAA’s\n\nboard, the gubernatorial-approval requirement for bond issuances\n\nand the Auditor General’s oversight over PHEAA pointed towards\n\narm-of-state status, other relevant factors, including PHEAA’s\n\nfinancial    independence      and     its    corporate       powers     “strongly\n\nsuggest[ed] that PHEAA is not an arm of the state.”                    Id. at 139.\n\nGiving Oberg the benefits of all reasonable inferences, we held\n\nthat the autonomy factor “counsels against holding that PHEAA is\n\nan arm of the state.”       Id.\n\n      On   remand,   the   district     court    concluded      that    the    facts\n\ndeveloped    through     discovery    made    “Pennsylvania’s       control     over\n\nPHEAA . . . quite clear.”             Oberg III, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 498.\n\nThe   district    court    believed    that    the    composition      of   PHEAA’s\n\nboard   --   gubernatorial     appointees       and    state    legislators       or\n\nofficials -- “gives the Commonwealth significant control over\n\nthe   direction     of   PHEAA.”      Id.      The    court    also    noted   that\n\n“Pennsylvania retains several forms of veto power over PHEAA’s\n\nactions.     The Treasurer must, as with all agencies, approve all\n\nexpenditures,     the    Governor    must    approve    all    of   PHEAA’s     debt\n\nissuances,    and    the   Attorney    General       must   approve     all    PHEAA\n\n                                       49\n\fcontracts         in    excess      of      $20,000.”          Id.         The     district      court\n\nexplained that, “[a]lthough PHEAA’s funding and partial fiscal\n\nautonomy weighs against a finding that PHEAA is a state agency,\n\nmost of the evidence shows substantial Commonwealth control and\n\nsupports finding PHEAA to be an arm of Pennsylvania.”                                    Id.\n\n       Oberg argues on appeal that the district court’s analysis\n\nof    the    autonomy         factor     is      inconsistent            with    our    analysis   in\n\nOberg       II.        In    Oberg’s        view,      the     evidence          produced      through\n\ndiscovery demonstrates that PHEAA in fact operates autonomously,\n\nwithout significant oversight or control by the Commonwealth.\n\nWe agree with Oberg that the statutory scheme governing PHEAA’s\n\noperation         and       the   evidence        in     the    record          establish      PHEAA’s\n\noperational autonomy.                See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 141 (describing\n\nthe    ultimate         question       as     whether     “PHEAA          is    truly    subject    to\n\nsufficient        state       control       to    render       it    a    part     of    the    state”\n\n(emphasis         added;          internal        quotation          marks        and    alteration\n\nomitted)).\n\n                                                    2.\n\n        The record contains substantial evidence showing that PHEAA\n\noperates autonomously, largely free from state interference in\n\nits substantive decisions.\n\n       The    “[m]ost         critical[]”         evidence          of    PHEAA’s       autonomy    is\n\nevidence of its “financial[] independen[ce].”                                    Id.     As already\n\ndiscussed,        the       evidence     developed           through       discovery      confirmed\n\n                                                    50\n\fthe financial independence we assumed in Oberg II.                         PHEAA is not\n\ndependent on state money for its survival and has not received\n\nappropriated funds for operational support since 1988.                               PHEAA\n\nsupports    itself        through    its       commercial        financial-services\n\nactivities,       through    which   it    earns     hundreds        of    millions    of\n\ndollars annually and has accumulated more than $1 billion in net\n\nassets.     PHEAA is statutorily vested with control over those\n\nfunds, see 24 Pa. Stat. §§ 5104(3), 5105.10, and the evidence\n\nfrom    PHEAA’s     own     officials     establishes         that    PHEAA     in   fact\n\nexercises that statutory control, see, e.g., J.A. 2469 (PHEAA\n\ntreasurer   acknowledging        that     PHEAA    board      makes       the   financial\n\ndecisions reflected in PHEAA’s annual report to Governor and\n\nGeneral Assembly); J.A. 249 (“PHEAA’s Board reviews, analyzes\n\nand    approves    PHEAA’s     internal        budget,    which      is    proposed    by\n\nmanagement and presented to the Board.”).                     PHEAA’s control over\n\nits     substantial,         independently         generated          revenues        thus\n\nestablishes PHEAA’s financial independence, which is a critical\n\ncomponent of operational autonomy.                 See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at\n\n139.\n\n       Testimony from PHEAA board members also shows the lack of\n\ninvolvement       by   the    General     Assembly       in    PHEAA’s      operational\n\naffairs.    When asked whether the General Assembly “submit[ted]\n\npolicy or business recommendations” to PHEAA, one of the non-\n\nlegislative members of the board responded,\n\n                                          51\n\f      The Legislature created PHEAA. . . . [I]t told them\n      what they have to do, give them the business operation\n      to take care of the students of Pennsylvania.\n\n           That was the Legislature’s role.    That’s their\n      only role at this point. They change their mind, they\n      can create a statute to change it.\n\nJ.A. 3353.         The absence of significant legislative control or\n\noversight     is     also    reflected    in     the    testimony   of     PHEAA’s\n\nchairman, who stated that “[i]f the Speaker of the House or any\n\nmember of the General Assembly would ask me a question regarding\n\nPHEAA, I certainly would meet with them and discuss whatever the\n\nmatter is with them.          But I do not report back to anyone in the\n\nGeneral Assembly.”           J.A. 2696; see also Declaration of PHEAA\n\nChairman    of     the   Board,   J.A.   249    (“The   Board   oversees    PHEAA,\n\nmakes the policy decisions for the direction of [the] agency,\n\nand   tasks      PHEAA’s    executives    and    managers   with    implementing\n\nthose decisions and directions on a day-to-day basis.”). 17\n\n\n\n\n      17In his declaration in support of PHEAA’s motion for\nsummary judgment, PHEAA’s chairman stated that “I know from my\ntenure on the Board and as its Chairman that by virtue of the\ncomposition of PHEAA’s Board with members of the legislative and\nexecutive branches, the Commonwealth exercises absolute control\nover PHEAA.”   J.A. 248 (emphasis added).   Oberg II, of course,\nforecloses any argument that the composition of the board\nestablishes absolute control.    Moreover, as we have previously\nindicated, a witness’s conclusory assertion of the answer to a\nlegal question is not controlling.     Cf. Doren v. Battle Creek\nHealth Sys., 187 F.3d 595, 598-599 (6th Cir. 1999) (explaining\nthat conclusory affidavits “restating the requirements of the\nlaw” but containing no “specific facts” do not “create a genuine\nissue of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment”).\n\n\n                                         52\n\f     The broad range of powers statutorily granted to PHEAA is\n\nalso important evidence of PHEAA’s operational autonomy.                    “PHEAA\n\nhas the power to enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and\n\npurchase and sell property in its own name, all of which suggest\n\noperational autonomy.”         Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139.            The statutes\n\ngranting    PHEAA    control    over    its    funds     on    deposit    with   the\n\nTreasury similarly are evidence of PHEAA’s operational autonomy.\n\nSee 24 Pa. Stat. §§ 5104(3), 5105.10,\n\n     PHEAA’s creation and support of PHEF also provides powerful\n\nevidence of PHEAA’s autonomy.            Even though PHEAA is statutorily\n\nauthorized     to    solicit    and    accept      charitable     donations,      it\n\ncreated PHEF and gave PHEF more than $10 million a year to do\n\nthat job. 18    And it did so in the absence of express statutory\n\nauthority      to    create    and     support      a    dependent       charitable\n\norganization, and without any involvement of the Governor or\n\nGeneral      Assembly     beyond       the     routine        review-and-approval\n\nprocesses of the Treasury Department and the Attorney General.\n\nPHEF thus provides a telling example of PHEAA exercising the\n\nfinancial and operational autonomy granted to it by statute.\n\n     Another        telling    example        of    PHEAA’s      financial       and\n\noperational autonomy involves an unsolicited, $1-billion buy-out\n\n     18 From all that appears in the record, PHEF did its job\nquite   poorly.     PHEF  collected   $11   million  in   private\ncontributions over a six-year period in which PHEAA provided\nPHEF with more than $86 million in cash and donated services.\n\n\n                                        53\n\foffer    made     in    2005    by       the   SLM    Corporation,      better       known    as\n\nSallie     Mae.        PHEAA’s       board     rejected      the     offer    on    its    own,\n\nwithout direction from the Governor or General Assembly.\n\n       PHEAA’s response to a dispute about billing calculations\n\nwith     the    agency       administering            Commonwealth      employee-benefit\n\nprograms        provides        another         concrete           example     of     PHEAA’s\n\nindependence from the Commonwealth.                         After the billing dispute\n\narose, PHEAA’s board first explored the possibility of providing\n\nhealth      benefits         “outside”          the     Commonwealth.          J.A.        2880.\n\nEventually, the board unilaterally reduced the amount it paid\n\nthe agency for its employees’ health benefits.                               See J.A. 2881.\n\nIn our view, these actions show autonomy on the part of PHEAA,\n\nnot domination by the Commonwealth.\n\n       Moreover,       PHEAA        itself     routinely      asserts        its    financial\n\nstrength       and     its    independence           from    the    Commonwealth.            For\n\nexample, PHEAA has described itself as an “independent public\n\ncorporation,” J.A. 3407, and as “a self-funded organization with\n\noperations      similar        to    a    not-for-profit        business,”         J.A.    3408.\n\nSee also J.A. 3020 (letter from a PHEAA vice-president to a\n\nPennsylvania         newspaper       defending        PHEAA’s      salaries    and    bonuses\n\nand distinguishing PHEAA from a “typical state agency”).\n\n       Similarly,       the     Commonwealth          has    indicated,       through      both\n\nformal and less-formal channels, its lack of control over PHEAA.\n\nOn   the   formal       side,       the    Commonwealth’s           Comprehensive         Annual\n\n                                                54\n\fFinancial        Reports        state   that         the        Commonwealth       “does        not\n\nsignificantly impose its will on the PHEAA.”                               J.A. 596.           Less\n\nformally, after PHEAA rejected the Sallie Mae offer, a spokesman\n\nfor then-Governor Edward Rendell stated, “We have no influence\n\nover PHEAA’s decision-making.”                 J.A. 3364.\n\n        When     this        evidence   is     considered              along    with     PHEAA’s\n\nstatutory corporate powers and its statutory control over its\n\nfunds on deposit with the Treasury, we believe it convincingly\n\nestablishes           that      PHEAA        operates           independently,           without\n\nsignificant interference from the Commonwealth.                                See, e.g., Vogt\n\nv. Board of Commissioners, 294 F.3d 684, 694-95 (5th Cir. 2002)\n\n(finding        levee     district      to    be      autonomous          for     arm-of-state\n\npurposes because district “has considerable management authority\n\n.   .   .

As described above, PHEAA must\n\nsubmit      contracts        over   $20,000     to    the       Attorney       General       for    a\n\n“form and legality” review determining whether the “contract is\n\n                                              55\n\fin         improper       form,        not         statutorily         authorized       or\n\nunconstitutional.”               71   Pa.     Stat.   §   732-204(f)).          A   Deputy\n\nAttorney General explained the review process:\n\n            Our standard under the statute is form and\n       legality, and what that includes is . . . the form of\n       the contract. . . . Does it comply with the contract\n       law, also does it include terms that are required of a\n       Commonwealth contract, and does it not include terms\n       that would be prohibited in a Commonwealth contract.\n\n            Then we look to authority. Does the agency as a\n       public agency have the statutory authority to engage\n       in this type of transaction, are there any other\n       statutes or court decisions that would allow or\n       preclude the contract. And then, thirdly, we look at\n       the constitutionality.   As a public agency, is this\n       type of thing constitutional in the state or federal\n       constitution.\n\n            If all that is all right, we approve it. We do\n       not look to business judgment.     We do not look to\n       financial issues. We do not look to political issues.\n\nJ.A.       3055;    see   also    J.A.      3058   (agreeing     that    “the   Attorney\n\nGeneral’s Office is not getting involved in business matters,”\n\nonly       “legal     formalities        to    ensure     that    it    complies      with\n\nPennsylvania law”; J.A. 3095 (“I don’t look at the business.                             I\n\ndon’t look [at whether it] is . . . a good idea.                          I don’t look\n\n[at whether it] is . . . what I would do in their place.                            I look\n\nto legal issues.”).              Thus, much like the Treasury Department’s\n\npayment-approval process, the Attorney General’s review process\n\nis     a     checklist-driven,           essentially       non-substantive          review\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\n                                              56\n\f        Although the review process is largely ministerial, there\n\nis no doubt that it amounts to an exercise of state control that\n\nrestricts PHEAA’s autonomy to some degree.                         The other aspects of\n\nthe Attorney General’s involvement in PHEAA’s affairs, such as\n\nthe requirement that the Attorney General represent PHEAA in\n\nlitigation       absent     a     delegation        of    authority      and      the     binding\n\nnature of any legal opinions issued by the Attorney General,\n\nlikewise must be understood as restrictions on PHEAA’s autonomy.\n\n       Other indications of PHEAA’s lack of autonomy relied upon\n\nby PHEAA derive from the general statutory provisions governing\n\nPHEAA’s    finances         and    operations:            PHEAA    was    created         by    the\n\nCommonwealth, can exercise only those powers granted to it by\n\nthe   Commonwealth,         and    can    be    dissolved         by   the     Commonwealth.\n\nUnder the statute in force during the time relevant to Oberg’s\n\ncomplaint, PHEAA’s 20-member board was composed of gubernatorial\n\nappointees and state officials, which suggests some level of\n\nstate control.         See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139.                             In addition,\n\nPHEAA     must    deposit         its    commercial         revenues         in     the    state\n\nTreasury,    and      the    Treasurer         must      approve    payments        made       from\n\nthose funds.       The Governor must approve PHEAA’s debt issuances,\n\nand the General Assembly has capped the total amount of debt\n\nPHEAA can incur.             PHEAA is required to report its financial\n\ncondition annually to the Governor and General Assembly, and it\n\nis    subject    to    audit       by    the    Commonwealth’s           Auditor        General.\n\n                                               57\n\fPHEAA is also subject to the Commonwealth’s Sunshine Act, see 65\n\nPa. Cons. Stat. § 701, and its Right-To-Know Law, see 65 Pa.\n\nCons. Stat. § 67.102. 19         All of these statutory facts were\n\nconsidered by the court in Oberg II but were insufficient in the\n\nface of PHEAA’s statutory control over its funds to tip the\n\nautonomy factor to PHEAA’s favor.              Our review of the record\n\ngives us no basis for striking a different balance.\n\n     Of   the   various   statutory    strings    that   tie   PHEAA   to   the\n\nCommonwealth, some are more important than others.              For example,\n\nthe requirement that PHEAA annually report to the Governor and\n\nGeneral Assembly, and the applicability to PHEAA of the open-\n\nmeetings and right-to-know laws, are “minor strings,” Takle v.\n\nUniv. of Wis. Hosp. & Clinics Auth., 402 F.3d 768, 771 (7th Cir.\n\n2005), that have little practical effect on PHEAA’s independence\n\nand are not dissimilar from requirements imposed by the state on\n\nother political subdivisions. 20           While they are relevant to the\n\n\n     19 Certain of PHEAA’s contracts are exempt from the Right-\nTo-Know Law. See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(1.1)(iii).\n\n     20 See 65 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 703 (Sunshine Act applies to\n“any political subdivision of the Commonwealth,” which is\ndefined to include “[a]ny county [or] city”); 65 Pa. Cons. Stat.\n§ 67.102 (Right-To-Know Law applies to a “local agency,” which\nis defined as “[a]ny political subdivision, intermediate unit,\ncharter school, cyber charter school or public trade or\nvocational    school,”   and   “[a]ny   local,   intergovernmental,\nregional   or   municipal   agency,   authority,  council,   board,\ncommission or similar governmental entity.”); 53 Pa.

See Regents, 519 U.S. at 429, n.5 (arm-\n\nof-state inquiry seeks to determine whether “a particular state\n\nagency has the same kind of independent status as a county or is\n\ninstead an arm of the State”).             Accordingly, while we conclude\n\nthat these minor strings do point towards arm-of-state status,\n\nthey do not carry much weight in the final analysis.\n\n       There is no doubt, however, that some of the more important\n\nstatutory strings tying PHEAA to the state, such as the payment-\n\napproval process of the Treasury Department and the oversight\n\nexercised by the Attorney General, operate to restrict PHEAA’s\n\nautonomy    to   a   certain    degree.       The     arm-of-state   inquiry,\n\nhowever, does not turn on whether the entity is subject to any\n\namount of state regulation at all, or whether it is subject to\n\nmore regulation than a private business, but whether the entity\n\nfunctions    independently      of    the     state    despite     the   state\n\nregulation to which it is subject.           See Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 580\n\n(explaining that the arm-of-state factors “endeavor to draw the\n\nline between a State-created entity functioning independently of\n\nthe State from a State-created entity functioning as an arm of\n\n\n\n\nto the Department of Community and Economic Development of the\nCommonwealth before issuing bonds).\n\n\n                                      59\n\fthe State or its alter ego” (internal quotation marks omitted));\n\nUniv. of R.I. v.

These statutory restrictions operate\n\npredominantly    at   the       administrative   edges     rather    than    the\n\ndiscretionary heart of PHEAA’s authority.            They may dictate the\n\nmanner in which PHEAA pays its bills, or require the inclusion\n\nor exclusion of a few contract clauses, but they do not intrude\n\non PHEAA’s exercise of its substantive discretion. 21                When the\n\nquestion   is   whether     a   state   exercises   such   control    over   an\n\nentity that the entity “is simply a tool of the state,” Oberg\n\nII, 745 F.3d at 139, control over matters of substance is what\n\n\n     21 In 2007, a firestorm of criticism erupted after PHEAA\nspent more than $80,000 on tickets to Hershey Park for employees\nand   their  guests   as   part  of   PHEAA’s  annual   “Employee\nAppreciation Day” at the park.

State Concerns\n\n       The   third    arm-of-state        factor     requires    us    to     consider\n\n“whether the entity is involved with state concerns as distinct\n\nfrom non-state concerns, including local concerns.”                           Oberg I,\n\n681 F.3d at 580 (internal quotation marks omitted).                     “‘Non-state\n\nconcerns,’       however,    do     not   mean   only   ‘local’       concerns,    but\n\nrather    also    encompass       other   non-state     interests      like    out-of-\n\nstate operations.”          Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137.\n\n       In Oberg II, we found this factor weighed in favor of arm-\n\nof-state status because PHEAA’s focus on improving access to\n\nhigher education was a matter of “legitimate state concern.”\n\nOberg II, 745 F.3d at 140.                In the course of this ruling, we\n\nrejected Oberg’s argument that “due to PHEAA’s commercial focus,\n\nits    operations    do     not     involve     an   area   of   legitimate      state\n\nconcern,” id. at 139-40, as well as his argument that PHEAA’s\n\nextensive out-of-state commercial activities showed that PHEAA\n\nwas not primarily focused on state concerns, see id. at 140.\n\n\n\n\nhave been required.   Moreover, given the based-on-the-pleadings\nconclusion in Oberg II that the autonomy factor weighed against\narm-of-state status, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139, the Oberg II\ncourt necessarily concluded that the level of state control\nreflected in the governing statutes was outweighed by PHEAA’s\nstatutorily vested control over its funds.\n\n\n                                           62\n\f       The         district         court         on       remand      concluded           that,\n\nnotwithstanding           PHEAA’s       substantial        out-of-state         activity      and\n\nincome, PHEAA’s activities primarily involve state, rather than\n\n“non-state concerns.”               See Oberg III, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 499.                       In\n\nthe court’s view, “[t]he fact that PHEAA purchases, services,\n\nand guarantees loans to borrowers throughout the country does\n\nnot    constitute         non-state       concerns         because    this      was    done     to\n\ngenerate earnings to return to Pennsylvania students and defray\n\ntheir costs.”            Id.\n\n       On appeal, Oberg argues that after discovery, the state-\n\nconcerns       factor          weighs    against       arm-of-state        status.         As    a\n\nsanction for PHEAA's discovery violations, the magistrate judge\n\nordered that “it shall be taken as established . . . that from\n\n2002    to    [October         2014],     the   majority      of     PHEAA’s      revenue     and\n\nincome       was    derived       from    out-of-state           activity.”         J.A.    172.\n\nOberg     contends         that     our     analysis        in     Oberg     II    makes      the\n\npercentage          of    out-of-state          earnings         determinative        of      this\n\nfactor.        Accordingly, because it is now established that the\n\nmajority       of    PHEAA’s        revenues       are     generated       by     out-of-state\n\nactivities,         Oberg        argues    that      the    district       court      erred     in\n\n\n\n\n                                                63\n\fconcluding that the state-concern factor weighed in favor of\n\narm-of-state status. 23\n\n      Although Oberg II clearly makes the amount of out-of-state\n\nactivity relevant, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137, we do not\n\nbelieve    it    makes      out-of-state    activity      dispositive,       as   Oberg\n\nargues.       Addressing Oberg’s argument in the prior appeal that\n\nPHEAA’s operations “were so focused out of state that PHEAA was\n\nnot involved primarily with state concerns,” we noted that the\n\ncomplaint alleged that in 2005, “one-third of PHEAA’s earnings\n\ncame from outside the Commonwealth.”                 Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 140\n\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).                           We then\n\nexplained       that   if    “one-third    of    PHEAA’s    earnings     came     from\n\noutside Pennsylvania in 2005, it does not seem plausible that by\n\n2006 -- the last year encompassed by Dr. Oberg’s allegations --\n\nPHEAA’s operations focused primarily out of state.”                    Id.\n\n      Oberg II’s observation that the complaint did not plausibly\n\nallege that the majority of PHEAA’s revenues were earned outside\n\nthe   state     cannot      be   understood     as   an   acceptance    of    Oberg’s\n\n\n      23PHEAA makes various arguments about why Oberg’s focus on\nthe out-of-state percentage is irrelevant or unwise. See Brief\nof Respondent at 37-39. In making these arguments, however,\nPHEAA fails to acknowledge that Oberg II explicitly held that\nout-of-state operations are relevant to the state-concerns\nfactor.   See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137 (“‘Non-state concerns,’\nhowever, do not mean only ‘local’ concerns, but rather also\nencompass    other   non-state   interests   like   out-of-state\noperations.” (second emphasis added)).\n\n\n                                           64\n\fargument that an entity cannot be primarily involved in state\n\nconcerns if the entity earns more than half of its revenues from\n\nout of state.          After all, Oberg II’s analysis of the state-\n\nconcerns factor considered facts beyond the in- versus out-of-\n\nstate source of PHEAA’s earnings, see id. at 140, and there is\n\nno reason to think those facts would suddenly become irrelevant\n\nthe    moment    out-of-state       earnings        cross    the   halfway      point.\n\nAccordingly,     while    we    find    it   highly    relevant    to    the    state-\n\nconcerns factor that “the majority of PHEAA’s revenue and income\n\nwas derived from out-of-state activity,” J.A. 172, we do not\n\nbelieve that fact to be dispositive.\n\n       Instead, when evaluating this factor, we must continue to\n\ngive weight to the fact that PHEAA’s work -- “facilitat[ing] the\n\nattainment      of    education    by    supplying      student     financial      aid\n\nservices,”      Oberg    II,      745   F.3d    at     140    --   involves       what\n\nPennsylvania         believes     to    be     an     “essential        governmental\n\nfunction,” 24 Pa. Stat. § 5105.6, and what we have concluded\n\n“is clearly of legitimate state concern,” Oberg II, 745 F.3d at\n\n140.    We must also consider the fact that PHEAA does provide\n\nsignificant services to the citizens of Pennsylvania.                          See Ram\n\nDitta v. Md. Nat’l Capital Park & Planning Comm’n, 822 F.2d 456,\n\n459 (4th Cir. 1987) (considering whether the services provided\n\nby the entity inured primarily to the benefit of local residents\n\nrather than state citizens in general).                     PHEAA administers the\n\n                                         65\n\fState Grant Program and distributes every penny of its state\n\nappropriations to qualifying students, and it has on several\n\noccasions made significant contributions of its own earnings to\n\nthe state program.           Thus, to the extent that PHEAA’s business\n\nactivities inure to the benefit of anyone other than itself and\n\nits   employees,      they     inure    to     the    benefit      of   Pennsylvania\n\ncitizens.\n\n      After    considering      all    of    these    facts     and     the    relevant\n\nstatutory provisions, we conclude that PHEAA’s case for arm-of-\n\nstate status under this factor has been weakened by discovery.\n\nThe extent of PHEAA’s out-of-state earnings is relevant to the\n\nstate-concern       factor,    see     Oberg    II,    745    F.3d      at    137,    and\n\ndiscovery has established those earnings at a level Oberg II\n\nbelieved “implausible,” id. at 140.                   Nonetheless, in light of\n\nthe other relevant facts noted above, we believe this factor\n\nstill points towards arm-of-state status, but just barely.\n\n                       D. Treatment under State Law\n\n      The final arm-of-state factor requires us to consider how\n\nthe   entity   is    treated    under       state    law.    “In   addressing        this\n\nfactor, a court may consider both the relevant state statutes,\n\nregulations,    and    constitutional          provisions     which     characterize\n\nthe entity, and the holdings of state courts on the question.”\n\nId. at 138 (internal quotation marks omitted). Noting that PHEAA\n\nwas created to perform an “essential government function” for\n\n                                         66\n\fthe benefit of the state’s citizens and that Pennsylvania courts\n\ntreat PHEAA as a state agency, this court in Oberg II concluded\n\nthat   the    state-law   factor     weighed    in   favor     of    arm-of-state\n\nstatus.      Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 140.\n\n       The district court reached the same conclusion on remand.\n\nThe    district   court   observed     that    PHEAA     was   created    by   the\n\nGeneral   Assembly,    that   “[a]ll    of     PHEAA’s    limited     powers   and\n\nauthority come from the General Assembly by statute,” Oberg III,\n\n77 F. Supp. 3d at 499, that it is exempt from state taxation,\n\nthat it is subject to Pennsylvania open-meeting and right-to-\n\nknow laws, and that its employees are treated as Commonwealth\n\nemployees.      The district court thus concluded that “Pennsylvania\n\nlaw clearly regards PHEAA as a state agency,” id. at 499, a\n\nconclusion that “weighs heavily in favor of finding PHEAA to be\n\nan arm of the state,” id. at 500 (emphasis added).\n\n       We agree with the district court that PHEAA is generally\n\ntreated as a state agency under state law.                 We see nothing in\n\nthe record, however, to support the heavy weight the district\n\ncourt assigned to this factor.               As the district court noted,\n\ndiscovery      established    that   PHEAA     employees       are   treated    as\n\nCommonwealth employees for purposes of payroll, retirement, and\n\nhealth-care benefits, which perhaps shows that the state treats\n\nPHEAA as it does traditional state agencies.               But discovery also\n\nyielded evidence showing the state treats PHEAA differently than\n\n                                       67\n\fit does traditional agencies -- for example, PHEAA management\n\nemployees   are    not    paid     in    accordance        with   Commonwealth       pay\n\nscales; governors ask PHEAA to return appropriated funds when\n\ntimes are tight but direct other agencies to do so; and the\n\nCommonwealth acknowledges in its financial reports that it does\n\nnot impose its will on PHEAA.                  While the statutes and state-\n\ncourt decisions relied on in Oberg II remain sufficient to tip\n\nthis factor towards arm-of-state status, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d\n\nat 140, the factual information learned through discovery falls\n\nfairly evenly on both sides of the scale.                    Accordingly, although\n\nthis factor weighs in favor of arm-of-state status, we cannot\n\nconclude that it weighs heavily in favor.\n\n                                          V.\n\n       Our analysis of the arm-of-state factors thus brings us to\n\nthis   point.       As   to    the      state-treasury        factor,    Oberg      II’s\n\ndetermination     that   Pennsylvania          is    not    legally   liable     for    a\n\njudgment    against      PHEAA       remains        controlling.        And    as      to\n\nfunctional liability, the keys facts assumed by the court in\n\nOberg II -- PHEAA’s control over its significant, independent\n\ncorporate    wealth      --   were       confirmed         through    discovery     and\n\nforeclose   a     finding     of   functional         liability.        Because     the\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania is neither legally nor functionally\n\nliable for a judgment against PHEAA, the state Treasury is not\n\n\n\n                                          68\n\fimplicated in this case, and the first factor weighs heavily\n\nagainst arm-of-state status.\n\n      As      to     the     autonomy     factor,      the    statutes          and     evidence\n\ndescribed above establish that PHEAA exercises control over its\n\nrevenues,      makes       policy      decisions,      sets     its    own       budget,      and\n\notherwise          manages    the     day-to-day       activities          of    the    company\n\nwithout      significant         interference        from    the    Commonwealth.             The\n\nareas    in    which       the    state      exercises       some    amount        of    control\n\nprimarily          involve     ministerial       matters       and     do       not     diminish\n\nPHEAA’s       control         over     substantive          matters.             Because      the\n\nCommonwealth vests PHEAA with a significant amount of autonomy,\n\nthis factor also weighs heavily against arm-of-state status.\n\n      As to the state-concerns factor and the state-law factor,\n\nboth weigh in favor of arm-of-state status.                            Since it has been\n\nestablished         for    purposes     of    this    case     that    the       majority      of\n\nPHEAA’s       revenues       during     the    relevant       period        were      generated\n\nthrough       out-of-state        activities,        however,        the     state-concerns\n\nfactor only weakly points to arm-of-state status.\n\n      If we simply did the math, so to speak, the factors would\n\nadd     up     to     “political        subdivision,”          not      “alter          ego    of\n\nPennsylvania.”             Arm-of-state status, however, is a question of\n\nbalance, not math.               In cases like this one, where the arm-of-\n\nstate “indicators point in different directions, the Eleventh\n\nAmendment’s         twin     reasons    for    being     remain       our       prime    guide.”\n\n                                               69\n\fHess, 513 U.S. at 47.        In our view, these twin reasons -- “the\n\nprotection of state treasuries and respect for the sovereign\n\ndignity of the states,” Gray v. Laws, 51 F.3d 426, 432 (4th Cir.\n\n1995) -- guide us to the same conclusion:                    For purposes of\n\nfederal law, PHEAA is a political subdivision, not an arm or\n\nalter ego of Pennsylvania.\n\n      PHEAA is a very wealthy corporation engaging in nationwide\n\ncommercial    student-loan     financial-services         activities.      It   is\n\nstatutorily vested with substantive control over its commercial\n\nrevenues, and it in fact exercises control over those revenues.\n\nIts   commercial     revenues       have     made   PHEAA     entirely     self-\n\nsufficient, and the Commonwealth has not appropriated funds for\n\nPHEAA’s operational support since 1988.               The Commonwealth does\n\nnot assert ownership of PHEAA’s commercial revenues, and it is\n\nneither legally nor functionally liable for a judgment against\n\nPHEAA.    Permitting this action to proceed against PHEAA thus\n\ndoes not place the Pennsylvania treasury at risk.\n\n      Permitting the action to proceed likewise does not offend\n\nthe   sovereign      dignity       of   Pennsylvania.           Although        the\n\nCommonwealth has imposed some not-insignificant restrictions on\n\nPHEAA’s   operations,    the    Commonwealth        has   nonetheless    vested\n\nPHEAA with broad power over its finances and operations.                 PHEAA,\n\nnot the Governor or the General Assembly, sets policy for the\n\ncorporation    and   makes   the    substantive     fiscal    and   operational\n\n                                        70\n\fdecisions.            Indeed,    the   Commonwealth            admits     in    its    public\n\nfinancial statements that it cannot impose its will on PHEAA.\n\nThus, the Commonwealth has structured PHEAA to be financially\n\nand    operationally        independent,           and    PHEAA      in    fact       operates\n\nindependently, without significant Commonwealth interference or\n\nsubstantive          supervision.        In    light      of     PHEAA’s       intended   and\n\nactual independence from the Commonwealth, we cannot conclude\n\nthat it would be an affront to Pennsylvania’s sovereign dignity\n\nto permit this action to proceed against PHEAA.                             See Hess, 513\n\nU.S.     at     52     (“[T]he    Port        Authority        is    financially        self-\n\nsufficient; it generates its own revenues, and it pays its own\n\ndebts.        Requiring the Port Authority to answer in federal court\n\n. . . does not touch the concerns -- the States’ solvency and\n\ndignity -- that underpin the Eleventh Amendment.”).\n\n       We      therefore    conclude          that       PHEAA      is    an    independent\n\npolitical subdivision, not an arm of the Commonwealth, and that\n\nPHEAA is therefore a “person” subject to liability under the\n\nFalse Claims Act.          In our view, any other conclusion “would . .\n\n.   heighten     a     mystery   of    legal       evolution”       by    “spread[ing]     an\n\nEleventh Amendment cover over an agency that consumes no state\n\nrevenues but contributes to the State’s wealth.”                           Hess, 513 U.S.\n\nat 51, n.21 (internal quotation marks omitted).                           Accordingly, we\n\nhereby vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment in\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\ffavor of PHEAA, and we remand for further proceedings on the\n\nmerits of Oberg’s FCA claims against PHEAA.\n\n                                              VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                               72\n\f",

Although we must consider “the provisions of state\n\nlaw that define the agency’s character,” Regents, 519 U.S. at\n\n429 n.5, “[u]ltimately . . . , the question whether a particular\n\nstate agency has the same kind of independent status as a county\n\nor is instead an arm of the State, and therefore one of the\n\nUnited States within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, is a\n\nquestion     of     federal     law,”        id.    (internal         quotation      marks\n\nomitted).\n\n     In    our     first   opinion      in       this   case,    we    held    that    the\n\ndistrict court erred by concluding that PHEAA was a state agency\n\nand dismissing Oberg’s complaint without applying the arm-of-\n\nstate analysis.       See Oberg I, 681 F.3d at 581.                    On remand, the\n\ndistrict     court    applied    the     arm-of-state           analysis      and    again\n\ngranted the motion to dismiss, concluding that PHEAA was not a\n\nperson within the meaning of the FCA.\n\n     Oberg again appealed, and we again held that the district\n\ncourt erred by dismissing the claims against PHEAA.                           See Oberg\n\nII, 745 F.3d at 140-41.           Considering the arm-of-state issue in\n\nlight of the statutes governing PHEAA’s operation and the facts\n\nalleged in Oberg’s complaint, we held in Oberg II that Oberg had\n\nplausibly alleged that PHEAA was not an arm of the state but was\n\ninstead a “person” subject to suit under the FCA.                       See id.\n\n     We first concluded that Pennsylvania was “neither legally\n\nnor functionally liable for any judgment against PHEAA.”                            Id. at\n\n                                             7\n\f138.     PHEAA was not legally liable because “state law expressly\n\nprovides that obligations of PHEAA shall not be binding on the\n\nState,” id. (internal alterations omitted), and requires PHEAA’s\n\ndebts to be paid from “‘moneys . . . of the corporation,’” id.\n\n(quoting 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3)).                    As to practical or functional\n\nliability,       PHEAA       argued      that       Pennsylvania       was      functionally\n\nliable     for     a     judgment      against        PHEAA     because         Pennsylvania\n\nstatutes       require    PHEAA     to    deposit      its     commercially        generated\n\nrevenues with the state Treasury and require the Treasurer’s\n\napproval of any payment from state Treasury funds.                              We rejected\n\nthat argument, however, given that the statute requiring the\n\ndeposit    also     explicitly        granted        control    over      those    funds     to\n\nPHEAA,     not    the     Treasurer,       and       the     funds    were      held    in    a\n\nsegregated       account      within     the    Treasury.           See   id.     at   138-39.\n\nBecause    PHEAA       had    control     over       “substantial         ‘moneys’     [that]\n\nderive exclusively from its own operations,” id. at 138, “any\n\njudgment in this case [would be paid] with [PHEAA’s] own moneys\n\nfrom     its     segregated      fund,”        id.    at     139,    and     we    therefore\n\nconcluded that Pennsylvania would not be functionally liable for\n\nany judgment against PHEAA.                And because there was no functional\n\nor legal liability, we held that the first arm-of-state factor\n\nweighed “heavily against holding that PHEAA is an arm of the\n\nstate.”    Id.\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f     As to the second arm-of-state factor, we noted that the\n\nindicia of autonomy reflected in the statutory framework and the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint pointed in both directions.                  The\n\ncomposition of PHEAA’s board (gubernatorial appointees and state\n\nlegislators) weighed in favor of arm-of-state status, as did the\n\nstatutory requirement that the Governor approve any PHEAA bond\n\nissues   and    the   fact   that   PHEAA’s   activities   were   subject    to\n\naudit by the Commonwealth Auditor General.                 See id. at 139.\n\nNonetheless, other facts “strongly suggest[ed] that PHEAA is not\n\nan arm of the state,” including PHEAA’s financial independence,\n\nits control over its revenues deposited with the state Treasury,\n\nand its corporate powers “to enter into contracts, sue and be\n\nsued, and purchase and sell property in its own name.”                      Id.\n\nDrawing all inferences from these facts in Oberg’s favor, as\n\nrequired given the procedural posture of the case, we concluded\n\nthat the autonomy factor “counsels against holding that PHEAA is\n\nan arm of the state.”        Id.\n\n     As to the third arm-of-state factor, we held it weighed in\n\nfavor    of    arm-of-state    status   because   PHEAA    was    focused    on\n\nimproving access to higher education, a matter of “legitimate\n\nstate concern.”       Id. at 140.     We rejected Oberg’s     argument that\n\nPHEAA was not primarily focused on state concerns, given PHEAA’s\n\nextensive      out-of-state     commercial     activities.        Noting    the\n\nallegation in Oberg’s complaint that one third of PHEAA’s 2005\n\n                                        9\n\fearnings came from out-of-state activities, we held that “it\n\ndoes    not      seem    plausible        that      by     2006       --   the    last    year\n\nencompassed       by    Dr.    Oberg’s       allegations         --   PHEAA’s     operations\n\nfocused primarily out of state.”                         Id.     And as to the fourth\n\nfactor, we concluded that state law treated PHEAA as a state\n\nagency, which also weighed in favor of treating PHEAA as an arm\n\nof the state.          See id.\n\n       Considering the factors together, we held that the district\n\ncourt erred by dismissing Oberg’s complaint:\n\n       [A]lthough the third and fourth factors suggest that\n       PHEAA is an arm of the state, the first (strongly) and\n       second (albeit less strongly) point in the opposite\n       direction.   At this early stage, construing the facts\n       in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we must\n       conclude that Dr. Oberg has alleged sufficient facts\n       that PHEAA is not an arm of the state, but rather a\n       “person” for FCA purposes.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).                         We vacated the district\n\ncourt’s order dismissing Oberg’s complaint, and we instructed\n\nthe district court on remand “to permit limited discovery on the\n\nquestion whether PHEAA [was] truly subject to sufficient state\n\ncontrol     to   render       it    a   part   of   the        state.”      Id.   at     140-41\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       On   remand,      the       parties     engaged     in     discovery,      and    PHEAA\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment on the arm-of-state issue.\n\nThe district court granted the motion, holding that all four\n\nfactors weighed in favor of arm-of-state status.

In the\n\ndistrict court’s view, this court’s contrary conclusion could\n\nnot    be        sustained    in    light       of   the      post-remand       “factual\n\ndevelopment” of the case.

The district court\n\ntherefore held that because PHEAA was an arm of Pennsylvania, it\n\nwas not subject to suit under the FCA, and the court granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of PHEAA.\n\n                                              II.\n\n       Oberg      again     appeals,    arguing      that    the     district    court’s\n\nanalysis of the arm-of-state factors is inconsistent with our\n\nopinion in Oberg II and that its ultimate conclusions as to\n\nthose factors are not supported by the record.                       In Oberg’s view,\n\nthe Pennsylvania statutes governing PHEAA’s operation and the\n\nfactual information developed through discovery establish that\n\nPHEAA is not an arm of Pennsylvania.                    Oberg thus contends that\n\nthe district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof PHEAA and dismissing his action.\n\n       “We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying\n\nthe same standard as the trial court and without deference to\n\nthe trial court.”            Dash v.

Instead, valid removal depends\n\nupon the officer behaving in a manner not befitting the trust\n\nplaced in him by the appointing authority.”).\n\n       PHEAA’s     purpose     is     “to   improve          the   higher      educational\n\nopportunities        of    [Pennsylvania]         residents          .     .   .    who     are\n\nattending approved institutions of higher education . . . by\n\nassisting them in meeting their expenses of higher education.”\n\n24 Pa. Stat. § 5102.          To further its statutory purpose, PHEAA is\n\nauthorized to issue, purchase, service, and guarantee student\n\nloans.       See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104.\n\n       PHEAA is statutorily authorized to “borrow moneys by making\n\nand issuing notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness of\n\nthe agency . . . for the purposes of purchasing, making or\n\nguaranteeing loans.”          Id. § 5104(3).             The Governor must approve\n\nall debt issuances, see id., and the General Assembly has capped\n\nthe total amount of debt that PHEAA may incur, see 24 Pa. Stat.\n\n§ 5105.1(a.1).         Under state law, PHEAA bears sole responsibility\n\n                                            14\n\ffor   its    bonds     and    other      debts.

Because the Pennsylvania General\n\nAssembly has determined that PHEAA is performing an “essential\n\ngovernmental        function,”       PHEAA      bonds    are    generally       free    from\n\ntaxation.      24 Pa. Stat. § 5105.6.\n\n      As     noted,    PHEAA       is    now    “one     of    the   nation’s      largest\n\nproviders of student financial aid services.”                            Oberg II, 745\n\nF.3d at 138.           During the time period relevant to this case,\n\nPHEAA’s commercial activity -- much of it conducted under the\n\ntrade       names     “American          Education       Services”       and     “FedLoan\n\nServicing” -- included issuing loans to Pennsylvania students,\n\nservicing loans for non-Pennsylvania students, and guaranteeing\n\nloans      issued     to     students      in       Delaware,    Georgia,       and     West\n\nVirginia.           PHEAA’s       2014   financial       statements      show    revenues\n\nexceeding $600 million, net revenues of more than $220 million,\n\nand unrestricted net assets of more than $700 million.                           See J.A.\n\n3147-48.        The        earnings      from       PHEAA’s     extensive      commercial\n\noperations      have       made    PHEAA   “financially         independent”       of    the\n\nCommonwealth, Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139, and PHEAA has received\n\nno appropriations to support its operations since 1988.\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f     PHEAA      administers     Pennsylvania’s        State    Grant     Program,\n\ndistributing appropriated funds as grants and scholarships to\n\nqualifying students.          PHEAA absorbs the costs of administering\n\nthe program, however, and disburses 100% of the appropriated\n\nfunds to students.        In 2005, PHEAA contributed $25 million of\n\nits earnings to supplement the State Grant Program, and it has\n\nmade contributions ranging from $45 – 75 million in many, but\n\nnot all, of the years since.\n\n     During the time period relevant to this case, PHEAA issued\n\nrevenue   bonds   to   fund    the    loans   it   originated,      repaying   the\n\nbonds    with   loan-repayment       revenues. 4     PHEAA    created    special-\n\npurpose   entities     incorporated      under     Delaware   law   to   formally\n\nissue the bonds and hold the student-loan receivables as assets.\n\nThese revenues are held in trust in accounts outside of the\n\nPennsylvania Treasury until the bonds are repaid or the release\n\nprovisions of the underlying documents are otherwise satisfied.\n\nThese trust accounts represent the bulk of PHEAA’s corporate\n\nwealth -- more than $6 billion of $8.6 billion total long term\n\nassets.    See J.A. 3148.\n\n\n\n\n     4 PHEAA stopped originating federally guaranteed student\nloans in 2008, “due to the global fiscal crisis.”      J.A. 327.\nSee J.A. 2440. As of July 1, 2010, the federal government took\nover as the originator of all federal student loans. See Health\nCare & Educ. Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L.

Stat.    §     5104(3),   a\n\nrequirement similar to that applicable to other state agencies.\n\nPHEAA’s revenues on deposit with the state Treasury are held in\n\na   segregated   fund    known   as   the    “Educational        Loan   Assistance\n\nFund.”   24 Pa. Stat. § 5105.10.             Although the revenues are in\n\nthe custody of the state Treasurer, state law expressly vests\n\ncontrol over the revenues in PHEAA.               See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3)\n\n(requiring revenues earned through financial-services activities\n\nto be “deposited in the State Treasury,” but providing that the\n\nrevenues “shall be available\" to PHEAA and “may be utilized at\n\nthe discretion of the board of directors for carrying out any of\n\nthe corporate purposes of the agency”); id. § 5105.10 (“[A]ll\n\nappropriations    and    payments     made    into      the   [Educational     Loan\n\nAssistance Fund] are hereby appropriated to the board and may be\n\napplied and reapplied as the board shall direct and shall not be\n\nsubject to lapsing.”).\n\n      Much like funds invested in a mutual fund, PHEAA’s funds,\n\nthough separately accounted for, are commingled with the funds\n\nof other Commonwealth agencies for investment purposes.

See 72 Pa.

To obtain approval for payment of funds in the custody\n\nof     the       Treasurer,       PHEAA        must     present          the    Treasurer          with\n\nrequisitions for payment.                      The Treasury Department audits the\n\nrequisitions            by    reviewing          “backup          documentation            such     as\n\ninvoices, contracts, [and] purchase orders” and “confirming the\n\nauthority for the payment (e.g., a valid supporting contract),\n\nand    a       match   between      the       amount    due       on    the    invoice      and     the\n\npayment request.”              J.A 673-74.             “If the requisitions appear to\n\nbe    lawful      and     correct,       the    Treasurer         issues       his    warrant      for\n\npayment.”          J.A.      673.        If    payment       is    approved,         the    Treasury\n\nDepartment         transfers        funds      to     PHEAA       electronically           or   sends\n\nPHEAA a check.               The checks are payable to the vendor and are\n\ndrawn on the state Treasury account and signed by the Treasurer.\n\n       For purposes of the “Commonwealth Attorneys Act,” 71 Pa.\n\nStat.      §§     732-101     –     732-506,         the    term       “Commonwealth         agency”\n\nincludes         “independent”           and     “executive”            agencies;          PHEAA     is\n\n                                                 18\n\fclassified as an independent agency, see id. § 732-102.                                  As is\n\nthe   case    with       other     Commonwealth           agencies,       if   the    Attorney\n\nGeneral provides PHEAA with a legal opinion, PHEAA must follow\n\nthe advice set out in the opinion.                    See id. § 702-204(a)(1).\n\n      While PHEAA has the authority to enter into contracts, it\n\nmust,     like      other     Commonwealth            agencies,         submit       contracts\n\ninvolving more than $20,000 for a “form and legality” review by\n\nthe Attorney General.              71 Pa. Stat. § 732-204(f).                      The review\n\ninvolves determining “whether the contract has all of the legal\n\nterms   that      the     Commonwealth         requires      and     no    terms      that    are\n\nprohibited”; whether “PHEAA has the authority to enter into the\n\ncontract”; and whether “the contract is constitutional under the\n\nState and Federal constitutions.”                     J.A. 713; see 71 Pa. Stat. §\n\n732-204(f) (requiring Attorney General to determine whether a\n\n“contract is in improper form, not statutorily authorized or\n\nunconstitutional”).           If an agency seeks to enter into a contract\n\nwith a party who owes money to the Commonwealth, the Attorney\n\nGeneral will not review the contract until the debt has been\n\nsatisfied.

A    state   may    also   be    functionally\n\nliable if the funds available to pay any judgment effectively\n\nbelong to the state rather than the agency.\n\n      Applying these principles in Oberg II, we concluded that\n\nPennsylvania       was    not   functionally     liable    because    PHEAA    was\n\nstatutorily vested with control over the significant revenues\n\ngenerated by its extensive commercial activities, such that the\n\njudgment    would    be    paid   with   funds    belonging     to    PHEAA,   not\n\nPennsylvania.

In the district court’s view,\n\nthe    fact    that    PHEAA’s    earnings         are   deposited       in     the    state\n\nTreasury, where they are commingled with other state funds and\n\ncannot be spent without approval of the Treasurer, showed that\n\n“the     Commonwealth       retains     [such]         significant        control          over\n\nPHEAA’s       assets    and    generated          revenue”       that    “[p]ractically\n\nspeaking, PHEAA’s money becomes State money.”                            Id.        We agree\n\nwith Oberg that the district court’s analysis on this point is\n\nlargely inconsistent with our decision in Oberg II.\n\n       Notwithstanding the district court’s “factual development”\n\nreference, its analysis did not depend on the evidence developed\n\nduring discovery, but instead turned on its understanding of the\n\ngeneral statutory framework governing PHEAA’s operation.                               As we\n\n                                           24\n\fhave already explained, however, this court in Oberg II rejected\n\nthe all-funds-are-state-funds argument.                       Instead, we held that\n\nbecause PHEAA was statutorily vested with control over the funds\n\non deposit with the state Treasury, PHEAA’s revenues remained\n\n“moneys     .   .   .     of     the   corporation”       despite       the        statutory\n\nprovisions relied on by the district court.                         Oberg II, 745 F.3d\n\nat 138 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Given      that    we      were   reviewing        the    granting       of    a   Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in Oberg II, our holding was based on\n\nan assumption that the control statutorily vested in PHEAA was\n\nin fact exercised by PHEAA.                 Nonetheless, because we held that\n\nOberg had plausibly alleged that PHEAA was not an arm of the\n\nstate,    we    necessarily       concluded      that    the    statutory          framework\n\ngoverning       PHEAA’s        operations    did    not,       in    and   of       itself,\n\nestablish a level of control sufficient to make PHEAA an arm of\n\nPennsylvania.       If the relevant statutory facts focused on by the\n\ndistrict court -- that PHEAA’s revenues are held in the state\n\nTreasury and cannot be used for payment without approval of the\n\nTreasurer -- were enough to establish functional liability even\n\nin the face of the PHEAA’s statutorily granted power over those\n\nrevenues, then we would have affirmed, not vacated, the district\n\ncourt’s arm-of-state conclusion in Oberg II.\n\n     In finding Pennsylvania functionally liable, the district\n\ncourt thus ignored the statutory facts that we found critical to\n\n                                            25\n\fthe issue -- PHEAA’s control over its significant independent\n\nfunds -- and gave the other relevant statutory facts a legal\n\neffect that we rejected in Oberg II.                 We therefore agree with\n\nOberg that the district court erred by analyzing the functional\n\nliability question in an manner inconsistent with the approach\n\ndictated by Oberg II.\n\n      This court, however, “review[s] judgments, not opinions.”\n\nCatawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v.

Timothy Guenther, PHEAA’s\n\ntreasurer, repeatedly testified in his deposition that financial\n\ndecisions were made by PHEAA’s Board of Directors.

That increase is primarily attributable\nto a contract with the federal government to service federally\nissued student loans.\n\n\n                                               27\n\fwill     be   used    to    supplement        the      State        Grant     Program;       and\n\nestablishes PHEAA’s corporate investment policy.

For example, when\n\nCommonwealth      revenues       fall    short    of     expectations,         it    is   not\n\nunusual for the Governor to ask state agencies to cut spending\n\nand return a portion of their budget to the General Assembly.\n\nThe record contains two gubernatorial letters requesting PHEAA’s\n\nassistance, and these letters distinguish PHEAA from other state\n\nagencies    and   make     it    clear    that     PHEAA      has     control    over     its\n\nbudget that other agencies do not.

Corbett stating that he had “directed agencies under [his]\n\njurisdiction to freeze . . . spending” but was “ask[ing] that\n\n[PHEAA]    make   the     same    sacrifice       as    the     agencies     under     [his]\n\njurisdiction”      (emphasis      added));        J.A.    3120       (letter    from      Gov.\n\nRendell noting that he had “directed commonwealth agencies to\n\nplace     1.9%    of    their     discretionary           budgets       into    budgetary\n\nreserve”    but    “ask[ing]       [PHEAA]        to     make     the    same       spending\n\nreductions that our commonwealth agencies are making” (emphasis\n\nadded)).\n\n     In    addition,      in    2007,    PHEAA     settled       a    dispute    with     the\n\nDepartment of Education related to the interest-subsidy issue\n\nraised in Oberg’s complaint for $11.3 million.                               According to\n\nPHEAA’s treasurer, PHEAA paid the Department of Education with\n\nloan-repayment         funds    held    in    trust      in   accounts       outside      the\n\nPennsylvania Treasury.            PHEAA also settled a dispute with the\n\n                                             29\n\fIRS for $12.3 million, and a portion of the IRS settlement was\n\nalso paid      from    assets     held    in    trust.       See   J.A.    2480.      The\n\nAttorney      General    would     have    conducted         the   form-and-legality\n\nreview of the settlements, but it otherwise had no involvement\n\nin    the    substantive       decision    to    settle      the   disputes      or   the\n\nnegotiation of the settlement terms.                     See J.A. 2845, 2847-48.\n\nThe    General       Assembly      was     not     required        to     approve     the\n\nsettlements, and it did not appropriate funds to replace those\n\nspent by PHEAA.         In our view, PHEAA’s actions in settling the\n\ndisputes demonstrates PHEAA’s control over its funds and its\n\nfinancial independence from the Commonwealth.                      And the fact that\n\nthe settlements were paid with a portion of the $6 billion held\n\nin trust outside the state Treasury is additional evidence of\n\nPHEAA’s ability to fund a judgment without the use of state\n\nfunds.\n\n       PHEAA’s    creation      and   support     of     the   Pennsylvania        Higher\n\nEducation Foundation (“PHEF”) also provides compelling evidence\n\nof PHEAA’s financial independence and control. 8                        Although PHEAA\n\nitself is authorized to solicit and receive private donations,\n\nsee 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3) & (8); id. § 5106, PHEAA officials\n\nbelieved      that    “‘many    private    donors      are     reluctant    to     donate\n\nfunds to a government agency,’” 2008 Auditor General’s Report at\n\n       8   PHEF has been inactive since 2009.\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\f74,   Exhibit         1    to       Oberg’s   Opposition     to    PHEAA’s   Motion     for\n\nSummary Judgment (“2008 Auditor General’s Report”). 9                         PHEAA thus\n\ncreated          PHEF,          a      one-employee, 10      tax-exempt       charitable\n\norganization, for the purpose of soliciting private corporate\n\ndonations.        PHEAA provided the funds and administrative services\n\nnecessary for PHEF’s operation.                       From 2001 through 2007, PHEAA\n\nprovided PHEF with more than $86 million in cash and donated\n\nservices.         Over that same period, PHEF collected $11.1 million\n\nin private donations.                  See 2008 Auditor General’s Report at 75.\n\nWhile PHEAA has the general authority “[t]o perform such . . .\n\nacts as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out effectively\n\nthe objects and purposes of the agency,” 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(7),\n\nPHEAA      had   no       specific      statutory      authority    to   create   or   make\n\ndonations to a charitable organization, see J.A. 2410 (“Briefing\n\nBook”      preparing        PHEAA       CEO   for     appearance    before   legislative\n\ncommittee        stating        that     there      was   “[n]o    express   legislative\n\nauthority” for PHEAA’s funding of PHEF).\n\n      In our view, the evidence outlined above establishes the\n\ncritical facts assumed in Oberg II when we rejected the claim of\n\n\n      9The parties included only a portion of this report in the\nJoint Appendix.\n\n      10PHEF’s single employee is its president and CEO.

As we discuss\n\nbelow, state law does impose some restrictions on PHEAA’s use of\n\nits funds, but those restrictions do not divest PHEAA of control\n\nover its funds or otherwise establish that the Commonwealth is\n\nfunctionally liable for a judgment against PHEAA.\n\n                                               2.\n\n       The   primary       way    the    Commonwealth        exercises       some        control\n\nover PHEAA’s funds is through the statutory requirements that\n\nPHEAA deposit its commercial revenues in the Treasury Department\n\nand the Treasurer approve any payment of funds held by Treasury.\n\n       To the extent that PHEAA continues to assert that these\n\nstatutory     provisions         establish       that     all    of      PHEAA’s    funds    on\n\ndeposit      in    the     state       Treasury       effectively         belong     to     the\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fCommonwealth, 11 that argument is foreclosed by Oberg II, which\n\nnecessarily concluded that these statutory requirements do not,\n\nin and of themselves, transform PHEAA funds into Commonwealth\n\nfunds.

Indeed,\n\nPennsylvania law expressly recognizes that not all funds held by\n\nthe Treasurer actually belong to the Commonwealth.                          See 72 Pa.\n\nStat.     §     301   (requiring      Treasurer      to     deposit    in     specified\n\naccounts       “all     moneys   of   the        Commonwealth      received    by   it,\n\nincluding moneys not belonging to the Commonwealth but of which\n\nthe Treasury Department or the State Treasurer is custodian”\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n     PHEAA       also    contends,     however,      that    the    actual     payment-\n\napproval         process,        as    established           through        discovery,\n\n“significantly constrain[s]” its spending and signifies a level\n\n     11 In support of this argument, PHEAA points to the\ntestimony of PHEAA treasurer Timothy Guenther, who stated in his\ndeposition that “[a]ll PHEAA funds held in the Treasury are\nfunds of the Commonwealth.” J.A. 2447. To the extent Guenther\nasserts that the funds are Commonwealth funds simply because\nthey are deposited in the state Treasury, that argument is\nforeclosed by Oberg II. Moreover, whether PHEAA funds belong to\nthe Commonwealth for purposes of the arm-of-state analysis is\nultimately a question of federal law that cannot be established\nby a witness’s conclusory assertion of the ultimate legal issue.\n\n\n                                            33\n\fof    control   that    makes     the     Commonwealth        functionally        liable.\n\nBrief of Respondent at 18.           We disagree.\n\n       The Treasury Department’s review-and-approval process, as\n\ndescribed by the evidence in the record, is not particularly\n\ncomplicated.     PHEAA prepares and submits a payment request; the\n\nTreasury Department reviews the payment request and its “backup\n\ndocumentation     such     as     invoices,           receipts,    contracts,       [and]\n\npurchase     orders,”    to     confirm         the    existence     of     a    contract\n\nauthorizing payment and an invoice matching the payment request.\n\nJ.A 673.     If the review raises questions, the Department rejects\n\nthe   request   and     returns      it    to    PHEAA    for     resolution      of    the\n\nissues.      If the review shows the payment request “to be lawful\n\nand correct, the Treasurer issues his warrant for payment.”                             Id.\n\nWhen a check is required, the vendor is paid with a check drawn\n\non the state Treasury and signed by the Treasurer.\n\n       The   approval     process         clearly       reflects     some       level   of\n\nCommonwealth     control      over      PHEAA,    as     it   effectively        requires\n\nPHEAA to adopt certain book-keeping procedures if it wants its\n\nvendors to be paid.        The Treasury Department’s review, however,\n\nis not a substantive review.               The Department does not evaluate\n\nthe wisdom of the underlying contract or the reasonableness of\n\nthe agreed-upon price, but instead simply confirms that a valid\n\ncontract authorizes payment and that the payment amount sought\n\nmatches the amount agreed to in the contract.                             The approval\n\n                                           34\n\fprocess    thus      does     not     constrain     or    otherwise        interfere        with\n\nPHEAA’s statutory authority to make the substantive decisions\n\ncontrolling the use of its revenues.                     See 24 Pa. Stat. § 5104(3)\n\n(PHEAA revenues held in the state Treasury “shall be available”\n\nto    PHEAA    and     “utilized       at    the    discretion        of    the     board    of\n\ndirectors for carrying out any of the corporate purposes of the\n\nagency”); id. § 5105.10 (deposits into PHEAA’s segregated state\n\nTreasury account “are hereby appropriated to the board and may\n\nbe applied and reapplied as the board shall direct”).                                   Indeed,\n\nthe   approval       process        doesn’t    even      commence        until     PHEAA    has\n\nexercised its discretion to enter into a contract or otherwise\n\ntake action that requires a payment to be made.\n\n       PHEAA,       however,        argues    that,       “[a]s      the        thousands    of\n\nexamples       of    requisition          questions      and     denials         produced     in\n\ndiscovery      clearly        show,    Treasury’s        review     is     no    mere    rubber\n\nstamp.”        Brief     of    Respondent      at   19.        In    PHEAA’s       view,    the\n\napproval       process      “is     not    ministerial      in      nature”       because    it\n\n“involves a comprehensive, multi-step process involving several\n\nlevels    of    submission,         substantive       review,       and    authorization.”\n\nBrief of Respondent at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe disagree.\n\n       Whether       the      review-and-approval          process         is     ministerial\n\ndepends on the nature of the review, not on the frequency with\n\nwhich the review identifies problems.                      And here, the undisputed\n\n                                              35\n\fevidence shows that Treasury Department officials simply check,\n\ncross-check, and confirm the information contained in contracts,\n\npurchase        orders,    and    invoices.         Complicated        contracts      may\n\nsometimes lead to lengthy email exchanges trying to unravel the\n\nagreed-upon pricing terms, but even then, the Department’s role\n\nis   simply      to    confirm    that    a    valid     contract      authorizes    the\n\npayment being sought in the amount being sought. 12\n\n      We recognize, of course, that by dictating the steps to be\n\nfollowed for payment to be made to a PHEAA vendor, the approval\n\nrequirement       places    some     not-insignificant          constraints     on    the\n\nmanner     in    which    PHEAA    pays    its     bills.       Dictating     specific\n\npayment     procedures,       however,        is   not   the    same    as    dictating\n\nspending        policy     and     priorities.            Because       the    Treasury\n\nDepartment’s          ministerial,       checklist-focused        approval      process\n\ndoes not substantively constrain PHEAA’s fiscal discretion, the\n\napproval        requirement       does     not,     in    and    of     itself,      give\n\n      12 When   arguing  that  the   approval   process  is  not\nministerial, PHEAA notes that “after receiving a $63 invoice\nfrom PHEAA’s outside counsel seeking reimbursement for a meal,\nTreasury demanded an itemized receipt from PHEAA and inquired\nwhether the meal included alcohol.”    Brief of Respondent at 19\nn.5.   Given that Pennsylvania’s reimbursement policy precludes\nreimbursement for alcoholic beverages and requires “[c]omplete\njustification” for reimbursement requests, see Commonwealth\nTravel Procedures Manual §§ 4.1, 7.1 (Nov. 1, 2011) (PDF file\nsaved as ECF opinion attachment), the Treasury Department simply\nasked PHEAA to provide the information necessary to show that\npayment was authorized.   We see no relevant difference between\nthat request and a request for PHEAA to provide the contract\nunderlying a given invoice.\n\n\n                                              36\n\fPennsylvania a level of control over PHEAA funds sufficient to\n\ntransform     PHEAA’s    independently           earned   revenues       into      money\n\nbelonging to the Commonwealth.\n\n       PHEAA also argues that Pennsylvania is functionally liable\n\nbecause PHEAA’s funds on deposit in the Treasury are commingled\n\nwith state funds and invested by the Treasurer.                        We disagree.\n\nThat PHEAA’s revenues were commingled with state revenues and\n\ninvested by the Treasurer were statutory facts before the court\n\nin Oberg II but were insufficient, standing alone, to establish\n\nfunctional     liability.        While     discovery      has    added       to    those\n\nstatutory facts and establishes that the Treasurer makes the\n\ndecisions    about     investing    these      commingled     funds,       we     do   not\n\nbelieve that adds much to the analysis.                      The commingling and\n\ninvesting -- a process that PHEAA’s own treasurer compared to an\n\nordinary mutual fund -- may reflect the Treasurer’s custodial\n\ncontrol over the funds on deposit, but it does not establish a\n\nlack   of    substantive    control      by      PHEAA.      That    is,     PHEAA      is\n\nstatutorily vested with the power to control its commercially\n\ngenerated revenues on deposit in the Treasury.                      The Treasurer’s\n\nconcurrent authority to use those funds to generate interest\n\ndoes   not   somehow    divest     PHEAA    of     control    over     its   funds      or\n\notherwise interfere with PHEAA’s exercise of substantive control\n\nover   its   funds.      Accordingly,         we   conclude     that    PHEAA’s        own\n\n“moneys,”    generated     through    PHEAA’s       commercial       activities        and\n\n                                         37\n\fheld in a segregated account, are not transformed into “moneys”\n\nof   the   Commonwealth       simply       because      they   are   commingled      with\n\nother state funds for investment purposes.\n\n       PHEAA also contends that it is “fiscally dependent” on the\n\nCommonwealth,       and   the   Commonwealth            is   therefore   functionally\n\nliable, because it must submit annual budget requests to obtain\n\nappropriations from the General Assembly, the legislature has\n\ncapped     the    total   amount      of    debt     PHEAA     can   incur,   and     the\n\nGovernor must approve all debt issuances.                       Brief of Respondent\n\nat 19.     Again, we disagree.\n\n       As the record establishes, PHEAA submits budget requests\n\nonly to receive the appropriated funds to be distributed under\n\nthe State Grant Program.           PHEAA is not required to submit budget\n\nrequests to gain access to its independently generated revenues,\n\nand the General Assembly does not take PHEAA’s revenues to fill\n\nholes in the Commonwealth’s budget.                      PHEAA’s participation in\n\nthe state budgeting process in its capacity as administrator of\n\nthe State Grant Program thus does not cast doubt on PHEAA’s\n\npower to control its extensive, independent funds, nor does it\n\notherwise make PHEAA fiscally dependent on Pennsylvania.\n\n       As to the statutory limit on PHEAA’s total debt and the\n\ngubernatorial-approval          requirement,         these     provisions     may    well\n\nmake     PHEAA     fiscally     dependent          on    Pennsylvania       for     state\n\naccounting       purposes.

For     purposes    of    the    arm-of-state       inquiry,\n\nhowever, we do not believe these restrictions suffice to make\n\nPennsylvania functionally liable for a judgment against PHEAA.\n\n      Preliminarily,        we    note   that      while        the    debt-limit    and\n\ngubernatorial-approval provisions do place some constraints on\n\nPHEAA’s business activities, nothing in the statutes directly\n\naddresses PHEAA’s control over its revenues, which is the key to\n\nthe functional liability question in this case.                        Moreover, these\n\nstatutory      requirements       obviously     have      not    been    obstacles       to\n\nPHEAA’s financial success, and there is no basis in the record\n\nfor us to conclude that Pennsylvania in the future would use\n\nthese      powers   to   shrink    PHEAA’s    operations         and    revenues    to    a\n\npoint where it could not withstand a judgment against it.                            See\n\nHess, 513 U.S. at 50.\n\n      In any event, while these statutory provisions do restrict\n\nPHEAA’s      financial     independence       to    some    degree,       Pennsylvania\n\nmunicipalities--which are subject to liability under the FCA--\n\nalso face similar requirements. 13                 These statutes thus provide\n\n\n      13See Pa.

The debt-limit and gubernatorial-approval provisions\n\nwere among the statutory facts that we considered in Oberg II\n\nand found insufficient, in and of themselves, to compel arm-of-\n\nstate status, and there is nothing in this record establishing\n\nthat these statutory facts should be given more weight than we\n\ngave them in Oberg II.\n\n                                           3.\n\n       Under these facts, the district court erred in concluding\n\nthat Pennsylvania was functionally liable for a judgment against\n\nPHEAA.       As        we     have    explained,         PHEAA’s         “substantial,”\n\nindependently generated corporate wealth, Oberg II, 745 F.3d at\n\n138, and PHEAA’s control over that wealth, were key to Oberg\n\nII’s    functional-liability          analysis.          The   evidence         discussed\n\nabove confirmed the existence of these facts.\n\n\n\n\nStat.  §   8022(a)   (placing  limitations   on  the  amount of\nnonelectoral debt incurred by local government units); 53 Pa.\nCons.

While   its    commercial\n\nearnings are deposited in the Pennsylvania Treasury, PHEAA is\n\nstatutorily vested with control over those revenues.                     See 24 Pa.\n\nStat. § 5104(3); id. § 5105.10.                  And as outlined above, the\n\nevidence produced through discovery confirms that PHEAA is in\n\nfact exercising the control granted to it by statute and that\n\nsubstantive decisions about the use of its substantial revenues\n\nare made by PHEAA, not the Governor or the General Assembly.\n\nThis point is exemplified by PHEAA’s creation of PHEF and its\n\ndonation to PHEF of $86 million in cash and services goods, all\n\nwithout specific statutory authority.\n\n       Of    course,    PHEAA   is   subject       to   some   measure    of   state\n\ncontrol over its finances, including the gubernatorial-approval\n\nrequirement, the legislative cap on total debt, and the Treasury\n\npayment-approval requirement.               Oberg II held that those facts\n\ndid    not   outweigh    the    control    PHEAA    had   over    its   independent\n\nfunds, however, and the record contains no evidence that causes\n\nus to reach a different conclusion.                 The gubernatorial-approval\n\nrequirement      and    legislative        cap   may    theoretically      place   a\n\nceiling on PHEAA’s earning capacity at some as-yet unestablished\n\nlevel, but an income ceiling does not affect PHEAA’s right or\n\n                                           41\n\fability to control the revenues it actually earns.                           The Treasury\n\npayment-approval process, though not an entirely inconsequential\n\nburden, is nonetheless a purely ministerial process that does\n\nnot in any way restrict PHEAA’s authority to set policy and make\n\nall substantive decisions about where and how its funds are best\n\ndirected.       None of these facts, whether considered individually\n\nor     collectively,       materially       diminish        or    constrain        PHEAA’s\n\nsubstantive control (vested by law and exercised in fact) over\n\nits funds and financial decisions.\n\n       PHEAA, however, objects to any consideration of the extent\n\nof    its    corporate     wealth     and   its       ability    to   fund    a   judgment\n\nthrough its own resources, insisting that arm-of-state status\n\ncannot depend on whether the state-created entity happens to be\n\n“flush at a particular juncture.”                      Brief of Respondent at 25.\n\nPHEAA argues that for the first two decades of its existence, it\n\ndepended on state appropriations to fund its operations.                             PHEAA\n\ncontends that in those early years, “the Commonwealth would have\n\nbeen    on    the   hook   to   pay    a    judgment      against     PHEAA,”       and   it\n\ncontends that “[t]here is no principled basis for rescinding\n\nPHEAA’s status as an arm of the Commonwealth simply because it\n\nnow    enjoys       financial   success          by    discharging      its       statutory\n\nmission.”      Brief of Respondent at 26.               We disagree.\n\n       First, Oberg II requires us to consider PHEAA’s wealth and\n\nits ability to use its funds to pay a judgment.                        Those facts, as\n\n                                            42\n\fpreviously discussed, were the critical facts on which Oberg\n\nII’s functional-liability decision was grounded.                     Oberg II thus\n\nestablished     that      PHEAA’s   access      to   its   substantial     corporate\n\nwealth was relevant to the functional-liability question, and\n\nthat determination is a legal ruling that remains applicable in\n\nthis appeal.

Although\n\nthe    creating    states     otherwise        exercised    a   not-insignificant\n\namount of control over the entity, see id. at 36-37, the Court\n\nheld in Hess that the entity was not entitled to share in the\n\nstates’       Eleventh      Amendment     immunity         given   the   entity’s\n\n“anticipated and actual financial independence,” id. at 49; see\n\nalso    id.   at   52    (“[T]he   Port    Authority       is   financially   self-\n\nsufficient; it generates its own revenues, and it pays its own\n\ndebts.

A\n\njudgment in this case would thus be paid with PHEAA funds, not\n\nfunds belonging to the Commonwealth.                     And given PHEAA’s control\n\nover its sizeable corporate wealth, there is little likelihood\n\nthat a judgment against PHEAA, even one that exceeds its current\n\nrevenues, would imperil its survival such that the Commonwealth\n\nwould     effectively      be    required      to     swoop     in     with   financial\n\nsupport. 16     Accordingly,     in    light    of       PHEAA’s     “anticipated      and\n\n\n\n\nlikelihood that the Commonwealth’s help would be required to\nsatisfy the hypothetical judgment.

Supp. 3d at 498.\n\nThe   district    court    believed    that    the    composition      of   PHEAA’s\n\nboard   --   gubernatorial     appointees       and    state    legislators       or\n\nofficials -- “gives the Commonwealth significant control over\n\nthe   direction     of   PHEAA.”      Id.      The    court    also    noted   that\n\n“Pennsylvania retains several forms of veto power over PHEAA’s\n\nactions.     The Treasurer must, as with all agencies, approve all\n\nexpenditures,     the    Governor    must    approve    all    of   PHEAA’s     debt\n\nissuances,    and    the   Attorney    General       must   approve     all    PHEAA\n\n                                       49\n\fcontracts         in    excess      of      $20,000.”          Id.         The     district      court\n\nexplained that, “[a]lthough PHEAA’s funding and partial fiscal\n\nautonomy weighs against a finding that PHEAA is a state agency,\n\nmost of the evidence shows substantial Commonwealth control and\n\nsupports finding PHEAA to be an arm of Pennsylvania.”                                    Id.\n\n       Oberg argues on appeal that the district court’s analysis\n\nof    the    autonomy         factor     is      inconsistent            with    our    analysis   in\n\nOberg       II.        In    Oberg’s        view,      the     evidence          produced      through\n\ndiscovery demonstrates that PHEAA in fact operates autonomously,\n\nwithout significant oversight or control by the Commonwealth.\n\nWe agree with Oberg that the statutory scheme governing PHEAA’s\n\noperation         and       the   evidence        in     the    record          establish      PHEAA’s\n\noperational autonomy.                See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 141 (describing\n\nthe    ultimate         question       as     whether     “PHEAA          is    truly    subject    to\n\nsufficient        state       control       to    render       it    a    part     of    the    state”\n\n(emphasis         added;          internal        quotation          marks        and    alteration\n\nomitted)).\n\n                                                    2.\n\n        The record contains substantial evidence showing that PHEAA\n\noperates autonomously, largely free from state interference in\n\nits substantive decisions.\n\n       The    “[m]ost         critical[]”         evidence          of    PHEAA’s       autonomy    is\n\nevidence of its “financial[] independen[ce].”                                    Id.     As already\n\ndiscussed,        the       evidence     developed           through       discovery      confirmed\n\n                                                    50\n\fthe financial independence we assumed in Oberg II.                         PHEAA is not\n\ndependent on state money for its survival and has not received\n\nappropriated funds for operational support since 1988.                               PHEAA\n\nsupports    itself        through    its       commercial        financial-services\n\nactivities,       through    which   it    earns     hundreds        of    millions    of\n\ndollars annually and has accumulated more than $1 billion in net\n\nassets.     PHEAA is statutorily vested with control over those\n\nfunds, see 24 Pa. Stat. §§ 5104(3), 5105.10, and the evidence\n\nfrom    PHEAA’s     own     officials     establishes         that    PHEAA     in   fact\n\nexercises that statutory control, see, e.g., J.A. 2469 (PHEAA\n\ntreasurer   acknowledging        that     PHEAA    board      makes       the   financial\n\ndecisions reflected in PHEAA’s annual report to Governor and\n\nGeneral Assembly); J.A. 249 (“PHEAA’s Board reviews, analyzes\n\nand    approves    PHEAA’s     internal        budget,    which      is    proposed    by\n\nmanagement and presented to the Board.”).                     PHEAA’s control over\n\nits     substantial,         independently         generated          revenues        thus\n\nestablishes PHEAA’s financial independence, which is a critical\n\ncomponent of operational autonomy.                 See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at\n\n139.\n\n       Testimony from PHEAA board members also shows the lack of\n\ninvolvement       by   the    General     Assembly       in    PHEAA’s      operational\n\naffairs.    When asked whether the General Assembly “submit[ted]\n\npolicy or business recommendations” to PHEAA, one of the non-\n\nlegislative members of the board responded,\n\n                                          51\n\f      The Legislature created PHEAA. . . . [I]t told them\n      what they have to do, give them the business operation\n      to take care of the students of Pennsylvania.\n\n           That was the Legislature’s role.    That’s their\n      only role at this point. They change their mind, they\n      can create a statute to change it.\n\nJ.A. 3353.         The absence of significant legislative control or\n\noversight     is     also    reflected    in     the    testimony   of     PHEAA’s\n\nchairman, who stated that “[i]f the Speaker of the House or any\n\nmember of the General Assembly would ask me a question regarding\n\nPHEAA, I certainly would meet with them and discuss whatever the\n\nmatter is with them.          But I do not report back to anyone in the\n\nGeneral Assembly.”           J.A. 2696; see also Declaration of PHEAA\n\nChairman    of     the   Board,   J.A.   249    (“The   Board   oversees    PHEAA,\n\nmakes the policy decisions for the direction of [the] agency,\n\nand   tasks      PHEAA’s    executives    and    managers   with    implementing\n\nthose decisions and directions on a day-to-day basis.”). 17\n\n\n\n\n      17In his declaration in support of PHEAA’s motion for\nsummary judgment, PHEAA’s chairman stated that “I know from my\ntenure on the Board and as its Chairman that by virtue of the\ncomposition of PHEAA’s Board with members of the legislative and\nexecutive branches, the Commonwealth exercises absolute control\nover PHEAA.”   J.A. 248 (emphasis added).   Oberg II, of course,\nforecloses any argument that the composition of the board\nestablishes absolute control.    Moreover, as we have previously\nindicated, a witness’s conclusory assertion of the answer to a\nlegal question is not controlling.     Cf. Doren v. Battle Creek\nHealth Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765649\"><a href=\"/opinion/765649/linda-doren-v-battle-creek-health-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 598-599 (6th Cir. 1999) (explaining\nthat conclusory affidavits “restating the requirements of the\nlaw” but containing no “specific facts” do not “create a genuine\nissue of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment”).\n\n\n                                         52\n\f     The broad range of powers statutorily granted to PHEAA is\n\nalso important evidence of PHEAA’s operational autonomy.                    “PHEAA\n\nhas the power to enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and\n\npurchase and sell property in its own name, all of which suggest\n\noperational autonomy.”         Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139.            The statutes\n\ngranting    PHEAA    control    over    its    funds     on    deposit    with   the\n\nTreasury similarly are evidence of PHEAA’s operational autonomy.\n\nSee 24 Pa. Stat. §§ 5104(3), 5105.10,\n\n     PHEAA’s creation and support of PHEF also provides powerful\n\nevidence of PHEAA’s autonomy.            Even though PHEAA is statutorily\n\nauthorized     to    solicit    and    accept      charitable     donations,      it\n\ncreated PHEF and gave PHEF more than $10 million a year to do\n\nthat job. 18    And it did so in the absence of express statutory\n\nauthority      to    create    and     support      a    dependent       charitable\n\norganization, and without any involvement of the Governor or\n\nGeneral      Assembly     beyond       the     routine        review-and-approval\n\nprocesses of the Treasury Department and the Attorney General.\n\nPHEF thus provides a telling example of PHEAA exercising the\n\nfinancial and operational autonomy granted to it by statute.\n\n     Another        telling    example        of    PHEAA’s      financial       and\n\noperational autonomy involves an unsolicited, $1-billion buy-out\n\n     18 From all that appears in the record, PHEF did its job\nquite   poorly.     PHEF  collected   $11   million  in   private\ncontributions over a six-year period in which PHEAA provided\nPHEF with more than $86 million in cash and donated services.\n\n\n                                        53\n\foffer    made     in    2005    by       the   SLM    Corporation,      better       known    as\n\nSallie     Mae.        PHEAA’s       board     rejected      the     offer    on    its    own,\n\nwithout direction from the Governor or General Assembly.\n\n       PHEAA’s response to a dispute about billing calculations\n\nwith     the    agency       administering            Commonwealth      employee-benefit\n\nprograms        provides        another         concrete           example     of     PHEAA’s\n\nindependence from the Commonwealth.                         After the billing dispute\n\narose, PHEAA’s board first explored the possibility of providing\n\nhealth      benefits         “outside”          the     Commonwealth.          J.A.        2880.\n\nEventually, the board unilaterally reduced the amount it paid\n\nthe agency for its employees’ health benefits.                               See J.A. 2881.\n\nIn our view, these actions show autonomy on the part of PHEAA,\n\nnot domination by the Commonwealth.\n\n       Moreover,       PHEAA        itself     routinely      asserts        its    financial\n\nstrength       and     its    independence           from    the    Commonwealth.            For\n\nexample, PHEAA has described itself as an “independent public\n\ncorporation,” J.A. 3407, and as “a self-funded organization with\n\noperations      similar        to    a    not-for-profit        business,”         J.A.    3408.\n\nSee also J.A. 3020 (letter from a PHEAA vice-president to a\n\nPennsylvania         newspaper       defending        PHEAA’s      salaries    and    bonuses\n\nand distinguishing PHEAA from a “typical state agency”).\n\n       Similarly,       the     Commonwealth          has    indicated,       through      both\n\nformal and less-formal channels, its lack of control over PHEAA.\n\nOn   the   formal       side,       the    Commonwealth’s           Comprehensive         Annual\n\n                                                54\n\fFinancial        Reports        state   that         the        Commonwealth       “does        not\n\nsignificantly impose its will on the PHEAA.”                               J.A. 596.           Less\n\nformally, after PHEAA rejected the Sallie Mae offer, a spokesman\n\nfor then-Governor Edward Rendell stated, “We have no influence\n\nover PHEAA’s decision-making.”                 J.A. 3364.\n\n        When     this        evidence   is     considered              along    with     PHEAA’s\n\nstatutory corporate powers and its statutory control over its\n\nfunds on deposit with the Treasury, we believe it convincingly\n\nestablishes           that      PHEAA        operates           independently,           without\n\nsignificant interference from the Commonwealth.

As described above, PHEAA must\n\nsubmit      contracts        over   $20,000     to    the       Attorney       General       for    a\n\n“form and legality” review determining whether the “contract is\n\n                                              55\n\fin         improper       form,        not         statutorily         authorized       or\n\nunconstitutional.”               71   Pa.     Stat.   §   732-204(f)).          A   Deputy\n\nAttorney General explained the review process:\n\n            Our standard under the statute is form and\n       legality, and what that includes is . . . the form of\n       the contract. . . . Does it comply with the contract\n       law, also does it include terms that are required of a\n       Commonwealth contract, and does it not include terms\n       that would be prohibited in a Commonwealth contract.\n\n            Then we look to authority. Does the agency as a\n       public agency have the statutory authority to engage\n       in this type of transaction, are there any other\n       statutes or court decisions that would allow or\n       preclude the contract. And then, thirdly, we look at\n       the constitutionality.   As a public agency, is this\n       type of thing constitutional in the state or federal\n       constitution.\n\n            If all that is all right, we approve it. We do\n       not look to business judgment.     We do not look to\n       financial issues. We do not look to political issues.\n\nJ.A.       3055;    see   also    J.A.      3058   (agreeing     that    “the   Attorney\n\nGeneral’s Office is not getting involved in business matters,”\n\nonly       “legal     formalities        to    ensure     that    it    complies      with\n\nPennsylvania law”; J.A. 3095 (“I don’t look at the business.

Thus, much like the Treasury Department’s\n\npayment-approval process, the Attorney General’s review process\n\nis     a     checklist-driven,           essentially       non-substantive          review\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\n                                              56\n\f        Although the review process is largely ministerial, there\n\nis no doubt that it amounts to an exercise of state control that\n\nrestricts PHEAA’s autonomy to some degree.                         The other aspects of\n\nthe Attorney General’s involvement in PHEAA’s affairs, such as\n\nthe requirement that the Attorney General represent PHEAA in\n\nlitigation       absent     a     delegation        of    authority      and      the     binding\n\nnature of any legal opinions issued by the Attorney General,\n\nlikewise must be understood as restrictions on PHEAA’s autonomy.\n\n       Other indications of PHEAA’s lack of autonomy relied upon\n\nby PHEAA derive from the general statutory provisions governing\n\nPHEAA’s    finances         and    operations:            PHEAA    was    created         by    the\n\nCommonwealth, can exercise only those powers granted to it by\n\nthe   Commonwealth,         and    can    be    dissolved         by   the     Commonwealth.\n\nUnder the statute in force during the time relevant to Oberg’s\n\ncomplaint, PHEAA’s 20-member board was composed of gubernatorial\n\nappointees and state officials, which suggests some level of\n\nstate control.         See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139.                             In addition,\n\nPHEAA     must    deposit         its    commercial         revenues         in     the    state\n\nTreasury,    and      the    Treasurer         must      approve    payments        made       from\n\nthose funds.       The Governor must approve PHEAA’s debt issuances,\n\nand the General Assembly has capped the total amount of debt\n\nPHEAA can incur.             PHEAA is required to report its financial\n\ncondition annually to the Governor and General Assembly, and it\n\nis    subject    to    audit       by    the    Commonwealth’s           Auditor        General.\n\n                                               57\n\fPHEAA is also subject to the Commonwealth’s Sunshine Act, see 65\n\nPa. Cons. Stat. § 701, and its Right-To-Know Law, see 65 Pa.\n\nCons. Stat. § 67.102. 19         All of these statutory facts were\n\nconsidered by the court in Oberg II but were insufficient in the\n\nface of PHEAA’s statutory control over its funds to tip the\n\nautonomy factor to PHEAA’s favor.

The     arm-of-state   inquiry,\n\nhowever, does not turn on whether the entity is subject to any\n\namount of state regulation at all, or whether it is subject to\n\nmore regulation than a private business, but whether the entity\n\nfunctions    independently      of    the     state    despite     the   state\n\nregulation to which it is subject.

In the course of this ruling, we\n\nrejected Oberg’s argument that “due to PHEAA’s commercial focus,\n\nits    operations    do     not     involve     an   area   of   legitimate      state\n\nconcern,” id. at 139-40, as well as his argument that PHEAA’s\n\nextensive out-of-state commercial activities showed that PHEAA\n\nwas not primarily focused on state concerns, see id. at 140.\n\n\n\n\nhave been required.   Moreover, given the based-on-the-pleadings\nconclusion in Oberg II that the autonomy factor weighed against\narm-of-state status, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 139, the Oberg II\ncourt necessarily concluded that the level of state control\nreflected in the governing statutes was outweighed by PHEAA’s\nstatutorily vested control over its funds.\n\n\n                                           62\n\f       The         district         court         on       remand      concluded           that,\n\nnotwithstanding           PHEAA’s       substantial        out-of-state         activity      and\n\nincome, PHEAA’s activities primarily involve state, rather than\n\n“non-state concerns.”               See Oberg III, 77 F.

In\n\nthe court’s view, “[t]he fact that PHEAA purchases, services,\n\nand guarantees loans to borrowers throughout the country does\n\nnot    constitute         non-state       concerns         because    this      was    done     to\n\ngenerate earnings to return to Pennsylvania students and defray\n\ntheir costs.”            Id.\n\n       On appeal, Oberg argues that after discovery, the state-\n\nconcerns       factor          weighs    against       arm-of-state        status.         As    a\n\nsanction for PHEAA's discovery violations, the magistrate judge\n\nordered that “it shall be taken as established . . . that from\n\n2002    to    [October         2014],     the   majority      of     PHEAA’s      revenue     and\n\nincome       was    derived       from    out-of-state           activity.”         J.A.    172.\n\nOberg     contends         that     our     analysis        in     Oberg     II    makes      the\n\npercentage          of    out-of-state          earnings         determinative        of      this\n\nfactor.        Accordingly, because it is now established that the\n\nmajority       of    PHEAA’s        revenues       are     generated       by     out-of-state\n\nactivities,         Oberg        argues    that      the    district       court      erred     in\n\n\n\n\n                                                63\n\fconcluding that the state-concern factor weighed in favor of\n\narm-of-state status. 23\n\n      Although Oberg II clearly makes the amount of out-of-state\n\nactivity relevant, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137, we do not\n\nbelieve    it    makes      out-of-state    activity      dispositive,       as   Oberg\n\nargues.       Addressing Oberg’s argument in the prior appeal that\n\nPHEAA’s operations “were so focused out of state that PHEAA was\n\nnot involved primarily with state concerns,” we noted that the\n\ncomplaint alleged that in 2005, “one-third of PHEAA’s earnings\n\ncame from outside the Commonwealth.”                 Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 140\n\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).                           We then\n\nexplained       that   if    “one-third    of    PHEAA’s    earnings     came     from\n\noutside Pennsylvania in 2005, it does not seem plausible that by\n\n2006 -- the last year encompassed by Dr. Oberg’s allegations --\n\nPHEAA’s operations focused primarily out of state.”                    Id.\n\n      Oberg II’s observation that the complaint did not plausibly\n\nallege that the majority of PHEAA’s revenues were earned outside\n\nthe   state     cannot      be   understood     as   an   acceptance    of    Oberg’s\n\n\n      23PHEAA makes various arguments about why Oberg’s focus on\nthe out-of-state percentage is irrelevant or unwise. See Brief\nof Respondent at 37-39. In making these arguments, however,\nPHEAA fails to acknowledge that Oberg II explicitly held that\nout-of-state operations are relevant to the state-concerns\nfactor.   See Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 137 (“‘Non-state concerns,’\nhowever, do not mean only ‘local’ concerns, but rather also\nencompass    other   non-state   interests   like   out-of-state\noperations.” (second emphasis added)).\n\n\n                                           64\n\fargument that an entity cannot be primarily involved in state\n\nconcerns if the entity earns more than half of its revenues from\n\nout of state.          After all, Oberg II’s analysis of the state-\n\nconcerns factor considered facts beyond the in- versus out-of-\n\nstate source of PHEAA’s earnings, see id. at 140, and there is\n\nno reason to think those facts would suddenly become irrelevant\n\nthe    moment    out-of-state       earnings        cross    the   halfway      point.\n\nAccordingly,     while    we    find    it   highly    relevant    to    the    state-\n\nconcerns factor that “the majority of PHEAA’s revenue and income\n\nwas derived from out-of-state activity,” J.A. 172, we do not\n\nbelieve that fact to be dispositive.\n\n       Instead, when evaluating this factor, we must continue to\n\ngive weight to the fact that PHEAA’s work -- “facilitat[ing] the\n\nattainment      of    education    by    supplying      student     financial      aid\n\nservices,”      Oberg    II,      745   F.3d    at     140    --   involves       what\n\nPennsylvania         believes     to    be     an     “essential        governmental\n\nfunction,” 24 Pa. Stat. § 5105.6, and what we have concluded\n\n“is clearly of legitimate state concern,” Oberg II, 745 F.3d at\n\n140.    We must also consider the fact that PHEAA does provide\n\nsignificant services to the citizens of Pennsylvania.                          See Ram\n\nDitta v. Md.

Thus, to the extent that PHEAA’s business\n\nactivities inure to the benefit of anyone other than itself and\n\nits   employees,      they     inure    to     the    benefit      of   Pennsylvania\n\ncitizens.\n\n      After    considering      all    of    these    facts     and     the    relevant\n\nstatutory provisions, we conclude that PHEAA’s case for arm-of-\n\nstate status under this factor has been weakened by discovery.\n\nThe extent of PHEAA’s out-of-state earnings is relevant to the\n\nstate-concern       factor,    see     Oberg    II,    745    F.3d      at    137,    and\n\ndiscovery has established those earnings at a level Oberg II\n\nbelieved “implausible,” id. at 140.                   Nonetheless, in light of\n\nthe other relevant facts noted above, we believe this factor\n\nstill points towards arm-of-state status, but just barely.\n\n                       D. Treatment under State Law\n\n      The final arm-of-state factor requires us to consider how\n\nthe   entity   is    treated    under       state    law.    “In   addressing        this\n\nfactor, a court may consider both the relevant state statutes,\n\nregulations,    and    constitutional          provisions     which     characterize\n\nthe entity, and the holdings of state courts on the question.”\n\nId. at 138 (internal quotation marks omitted). Noting that PHEAA\n\nwas created to perform an “essential government function” for\n\n                                         66\n\fthe benefit of the state’s citizens and that Pennsylvania courts\n\ntreat PHEAA as a state agency, this court in Oberg II concluded\n\nthat   the    state-law   factor     weighed    in   favor     of    arm-of-state\n\nstatus.      Oberg II, 745 F.3d at 140.\n\n       The district court reached the same conclusion on remand.\n\nThe    district   court   observed     that    PHEAA     was   created    by   the\n\nGeneral   Assembly,    that   “[a]ll    of     PHEAA’s    limited     powers   and\n\nauthority come from the General Assembly by statute,” Oberg III,\n\n77 F. Supp. 3d at 499, that it is exempt from state taxation,\n\nthat it is subject to Pennsylvania open-meeting and right-to-\n\nknow laws, and that its employees are treated as Commonwealth\n\nemployees.      The district court thus concluded that “Pennsylvania\n\nlaw clearly regards PHEAA as a state agency,” id. at 499, a\n\nconclusion that “weighs heavily in favor of finding PHEAA to be\n\nan arm of the state,” id. at 500 (emphasis added).\n\n       We agree with the district court that PHEAA is generally\n\ntreated as a state agency under state law.                 We see nothing in\n\nthe record, however, to support the heavy weight the district\n\ncourt assigned to this factor.               As the district court noted,\n\ndiscovery      established    that   PHEAA     employees       are   treated    as\n\nCommonwealth employees for purposes of payroll, retirement, and\n\nhealth-care benefits, which perhaps shows that the state treats\n\nPHEAA as it does traditional state agencies.               But discovery also\n\nyielded evidence showing the state treats PHEAA differently than\n\n                                       67\n\fit does traditional agencies -- for example, PHEAA management\n\nemployees   are    not    paid     in    accordance        with   Commonwealth       pay\n\nscales; governors ask PHEAA to return appropriated funds when\n\ntimes are tight but direct other agencies to do so; and the\n\nCommonwealth acknowledges in its financial reports that it does\n\nnot impose its will on PHEAA.                  While the statutes and state-\n\ncourt decisions relied on in Oberg II remain sufficient to tip\n\nthis factor towards arm-of-state status, see Oberg II, 745 F.3d\n\nat 140, the factual information learned through discovery falls\n\nfairly evenly on both sides of the scale.                    Accordingly, although\n\nthis factor weighs in favor of arm-of-state status, we cannot\n\nconclude that it weighs heavily in favor.\n\n                                          V.\n\n       Our analysis of the arm-of-state factors thus brings us to\n\nthis   point.       As   to    the      state-treasury        factor,    Oberg      II’s\n\ndetermination     that   Pennsylvania          is    not    legally   liable     for    a\n\njudgment    against      PHEAA       remains        controlling.        And    as      to\n\nfunctional liability, the keys facts assumed by the court in\n\nOberg II -- PHEAA’s control over its significant, independent\n\ncorporate    wealth      --   were       confirmed         through    discovery     and\n\nforeclose   a     finding     of   functional         liability.        Because     the\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania is neither legally nor functionally\n\nliable for a judgment against PHEAA, the state Treasury is not\n\n\n\n                                          68\n\fimplicated in this case, and the first factor weighs heavily\n\nagainst arm-of-state status.\n\n      As      to     the     autonomy     factor,      the    statutes          and     evidence\n\ndescribed above establish that PHEAA exercises control over its\n\nrevenues,      makes       policy      decisions,      sets     its    own       budget,      and\n\notherwise          manages    the     day-to-day       activities          of    the    company\n\nwithout      significant         interference        from    the    Commonwealth.             The\n\nareas    in    which       the    state      exercises       some    amount        of    control\n\nprimarily          involve     ministerial       matters       and     do       not     diminish\n\nPHEAA’s       control         over     substantive          matters.             Because      the\n\nCommonwealth vests PHEAA with a significant amount of autonomy,\n\nthis factor also weighs heavily against arm-of-state status.\n\n      As to the state-concerns factor and the state-law factor,\n\nboth weigh in favor of arm-of-state status.                            Since it has been\n\nestablished         for    purposes     of    this    case     that    the       majority      of\n\nPHEAA’s       revenues       during     the    relevant       period        were      generated\n\nthrough       out-of-state        activities,        however,        the     state-concerns\n\nfactor only weakly points to arm-of-state status.\n\n      If we simply did the math, so to speak, the factors would\n\nadd     up     to     “political        subdivision,”          not      “alter          ego    of\n\nPennsylvania.”             Arm-of-state status, however, is a question of\n\nbalance, not math.               In cases like this one, where the arm-of-\n\nstate “indicators point in different directions, the Eleventh\n\nAmendment’s         twin     reasons    for    being     remain       our       prime    guide.”\n\n                                               69\n\fHess, 513 U.S. at 47.        In our view, these twin reasons -- “the\n\nprotection of state treasuries and respect for the sovereign\n\ndignity of the states,” Gray v. Laws, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692981\"><a href=\"/opinion/692981/john-d-gray-v-tony-laws-individually-and-officially-as-an-orange-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432 (4th Cir.\n\n1995) -- guide us to the same conclusion:                    For purposes of\n\nfederal law, PHEAA is a political subdivision, not an arm or\n\nalter ego of Pennsylvania.\n\n      PHEAA is a very wealthy corporation engaging in nationwide\n\ncommercial    student-loan     financial-services         activities.      It   is\n\nstatutorily vested with substantive control over its commercial\n\nrevenues, and it in fact exercises control over those revenues.\n\nIts   commercial     revenues       have     made   PHEAA     entirely     self-\n\nsufficient, and the Commonwealth has not appropriated funds for\n\nPHEAA’s operational support since 1988.               The Commonwealth does\n\nnot assert ownership of PHEAA’s commercial revenues, and it is\n\nneither legally nor functionally liable for a judgment against\n\nPHEAA.    Permitting this action to proceed against PHEAA thus\n\ndoes not place the Pennsylvania treasury at risk.\n\n      Permitting the action to proceed likewise does not offend\n\nthe   sovereign      dignity       of   Pennsylvania.           Although        the\n\nCommonwealth has imposed some not-insignificant restrictions on\n\nPHEAA’s   operations,    the    Commonwealth        has   nonetheless    vested\n\nPHEAA with broad power over its finances and operations.                 PHEAA,\n\nnot the Governor or the General Assembly, sets policy for the\n\ncorporation    and   makes   the    substantive     fiscal    and   operational\n\n                                        70\n\fdecisions.            Indeed,    the   Commonwealth            admits     in    its    public\n\nfinancial statements that it cannot impose its will on PHEAA.\n\nThus, the Commonwealth has structured PHEAA to be financially\n\nand    operationally        independent,           and    PHEAA      in    fact       operates\n\nindependently, without significant Commonwealth interference or\n\nsubstantive          supervision.        In    light      of     PHEAA’s       intended   and\n\nactual independence from the Commonwealth, we cannot conclude\n\nthat it would be an affront to Pennsylvania’s sovereign dignity\n\nto permit this action to proceed against PHEAA.                             See Hess, 513\n\nU.S.     at     52     (“[T]he    Port        Authority        is    financially        self-\n\nsufficient; it generates its own revenues, and it pays its own\n\ndebts.        Requiring the Port Authority to answer in federal court\n\n. . . does not touch the concerns -- the States’ solvency and\n\ndignity -- that underpin the Eleventh Amendment.”).\n\n       We      therefore    conclude          that       PHEAA      is    an    independent\n\npolitical subdivision, not an arm of the Commonwealth, and that\n\nPHEAA is therefore a “person” subject to liability under the\n\nFalse Claims Act.          In our view, any other conclusion “would . .\n\n.   heighten     a     mystery   of    legal       evolution”       by    “spread[ing]     an\n\nEleventh Amendment cover over an agency that consumes no state\n\nrevenues but contributes to the State’s wealth.”                           Hess, 513 U.S.\n\nat 51, n.21 (internal quotation marks omitted).                           Accordingly, we\n\nhereby vacate the district court’s grant of summary judgment in\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\ffavor of PHEAA, and we remand for further proceedings on the\n\nmerits of Oberg’s FCA claims against PHEAA.\n\n                                              VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                               72\n\f</pre>",
