Ct. No. 185632)\n\n           v.\n\nJOHNNY MELENDEZ CORDOVA,\n\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n        Defendant Johnny Melendez Cordova is serving a sentence of 25 years to life\nunder the “Three Strikes” law. He petitioned the trial court for resentencing under Penal\nCode section 1170.126 (§ 1170.126), which is part of the Three Strikes Reform Act of\n2012, also known as Proposition 36 (Reform Act). That act entitled him to a reduction in\nhis sentence unless such a reduction would “pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (f) (§ 1170.126(f).) The trial court found this\ncondition to be present and denied his petition on that ground. While this appeal from\nthat ruling was pending, voters adopted the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, also\nknown as Proposition 47 (Safe Neighborhoods Act), which substantially narrowed the\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as that phrase was “used\nthroughout this Code.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.18, subd. (c) (§ 1170.18(c)).) We conclude\nthat the new definition applies, in accordance with its plain terms, to determinations of\ndangerousness under the Reform Act, and that notwithstanding the presumption against\nstatutory retroactivity, it applies to petitions that had already been adjudicated when it\n\fwas adopted. Accordingly, we will reverse with directions to conduct a new hearing on\ndefendant’s petition in which section 1170.18(c)’s definition of dangerousness will\ngovern the determination whether resentencing will pose an unreasonable risk of danger\nto public safety. This disposition renders moot defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency\nof the evidence to sustain the trial court’s ruling under the prior standard. We reject\ndefendant’s contentions that (1) conditioning relief on non-dangerousness violates his\nright to equal protection of the laws; (2) failing to prove dangerousness to a jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt violates his constitutional right to jury trial; and (3) a “strong\npresumption” favors resentencing. We emphasize, however, that the state bears the\nburden of proving that resentencing would create an unreasonable risk of danger as\ndefined in section 1170.18(c).\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Defendant’s Strikes.\n\n       In May 1973, at the age of 19, defendant was charged with a number of felonies\narising from two incidents on successive days. One incident involved a home invasion\nrobbery in which, according to the police report, defendant held a woman and her\nchildren at gunpoint while threatening violence against them. According to a later\ndecision by this court, defendant eventually accumulated four convictions for serious or\nviolent felonies—commonly known as strikes—for purposes of the Three Strikes law,\nPenal Code sections 667 and 1192.7. (People v. Cordova (Nov. 25, 1998, H015896)\n[nonpub. opn.] [at pp. 16-17].)1\n\n\n       1\n         We have granted respondent’s request for judicial notice of the cited opinion as\nwell as an earlier opinion concerning one of the 1973 offenses and a 1982 offense for\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. (People v. Cordova (Dec. 27, 1985,\nA028169) [nonpub. opn.].) According to the District’s Attorneys opposition\nmemorandum below, the latter charge arose when a plainclothes officer saw defendant\n                                              2\n\f       B. Three Strikes Law.\n\n       Two decades after defendant sustained the foregoing convictions, voters and the\nLegislature, respectively, adopted the Three Strikes law.2 (Former Pen. Code, § 667\n[Stats. 1994, ch. 12, § 1]; former Pen. Code, § 1170.12 [Prop. 184, as approved by voters,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994)].) From its enactment until 2012, it provided that a defendant\nwith a prior strike who was convicted of any subsequent felony would receive what came\nto be known as a “second strike” sentence, i.e., imprisonment for “twice the term\notherwise provided as punishment.” (Pen. Code, § 667, subd. (e)(1), as adopted by Stats.\n1994, ch. 12, § 1; id., § 1170.12, subd. (c)(1), as adopted by Prop 184.) One with two\nstrikes who suffered a subsequent felony conviction would receive a “third strike”\nsentence of 25 years to life. (Former Pen. Code, §§ 667, subds. (e)(1), (e)(2)(A)(ii), as\nadopted by Stats. 1994, ch. 12, § 1]; former Pen. Code, § 1170.12, subds. (c)(1),\n(c)(2)(A)(ii), as adopted by Prop 184.)\n\n       C. Defendant’s Third-Strike Conviction.\n\n       In December 1995 defendant was arrested on a charge of carrying a concealed dirk\nor dagger, a violation of former Penal Code section 12020, subdivision (a). (See now\nPen. Code, § 21310.) In July 1996 a jury found him guilty of that offense. The offense\nwas (and still is) a “wobbler,” i.e., it could be prosecuted either as a misdemeanor or a\nfelony; if punished as a felony, it would ordinarily carry a maximum penalty of three\nyears’ imprisonment. (Former Pen. Code, § 12020, subd. (a), as adopted by Stats.1994,\nch. 23, § 4, p. 132; former Pen. Code, § 18, as adopted by Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, § 98,\n\n\nfiring a hunting rifle at a shooting range. Defendant told the officer that “he had recently\npurchased the weapon for $1,100 and . . . was planning on hunting . . . in Idaho.”\n       2\n        We refer to the law in the singular while recognizing that it was adopted in two\nversions—which do not, however, vary materially for present purposes.\n\n                                             3\n\fp. 5089; see now Pen. Code, §§ 21310, 1170, subd. (h).) As a third-striker, however,\ndefendant was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life.3 This court affirmed the\nconviction and sentence. (People v. Cordova, supra, H015896 [p. 17].)\n\n       D. Reform Act.\n\n       Defendant was serving the above sentence on November 6, 2012, when voters\nadopted the Reform Act. It has two chief components: “the first part is prospective only,\nreducing the sentence to be imposed in future three strike cases where the third strike is\nnot a serious or violent felony (Pen. Code, §§ 667, 1170.12); the second part is\nretrospective, providing similar, but not identical, relief for prisoners already serving\nthird strike sentences in cases where the third strike was not a serious or violent felony\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126).” (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th\n1279, 1292 (Kaulick).) More specifically, the prospective provisions make new non-\nstrike felonies generally punishable by a maximum sentence of double the base term—a\nformer second-strike sentence—regardless of the number of strike priors. (Pen. Code,\n§§ 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C), 667, subd. (e)(2)(C).) The retrospective provision, section\n1170.126(f), entitles third-strikers who would be eligible for reduced sentencing if their\nconvictions were new to petition for recall of sentence.\n       Section 1170.26(f) directs that a petitioner who satisfies the criteria for eligibility\n“shall be resentenced” as a second-striker “unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” In exercising the discretion thus granted, the court may consider: “(1) The\n       3\n          The probation officer recommended a sentence of 31 years to life, consisting of\nthe third-strike life sentence plus six one-year enhancements for prior convictions. (See\nPen. Code, § 667.5, subd. (b).) According to our decision in that case, the trial court\nstayed the enhancements. The correct procedure was to strike them, but nothing has been\nmade of the trial court’s failure to do so. (See People v. Langston (2004) 33 Cal.4th\n1237, 1241.) The trial court also denied a motion to strike any of the “strike” priors.\n\n                                               4\n\fpetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the\nextent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of\nthe crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\nincarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to\nbe relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).) However, the act contains no definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” a phrase which, at the time of its adoption,\nappeared nowhere else in the Penal Code.4\n\n       E. Petition and Appeal.\n\n       On August 22, 2013, defendant filed a petition for resentencing under\nsection 1170.126(f). The court found that he satisfied the criteria for eligibility—a point\nthe state does not contest—and appointed counsel to represent him. A clinical\npsychologist conducted a mental health examination and found no evidence that\ndefendant, then 60 years old, would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety if released. However, the prosecutor presented over 950 pages of records\nreflecting an extensive history of criminal conduct beginning at the age of 13. These\nmaterials alluded to a number of uncharged crimes involving incipient or actual violence,\nincluding two homicides in which defendant was reportedly implicated.5 In all, between\n\n       4\n           The operative language may have been borrowed from cases reviewing\ndecisions by the Board of Parole Hearings to deny parole to a life prisoner on the ground\nthat, as stated in the governing regulation, “the prisoner will pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to society if released from prison.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 2402, subd. (a).)\nCases have often couched such findings in terms of “an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety.” (E.g., Board of Prison Terms v. Superior Court (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th\n1212, 1221; In re Moses (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1286; In re Tapia (2012) 207\nCal.App.4th 1104, 1106.)\n       5\n        A number of these offenses and suspected offenses apparently arose out of\ndefendant’s membership in Nuestra Familia, a notorious prison gang. In January 1997,\n                                             5\n\f1973 and 1995, defendant was convicted of 17 misdemeanors and 12 felonies. The\nprosecutor also cited an extensive disciplinary history in prison, although the only\nincidents that appeared to involve violence were (1) a reported threat by defendant in\n2004 against an inmate he reportedly believed was a child molester—an incident\nattributed by both inmates to a misunderstanding; (2) a four-inmate fight in 2006, the\norigins of which officers were unable to establish, but in which one of the inmates was\napparently armed with a razor blade6; and (3) a beating of defendant in 2006 by a\ncellmate for unknown reasons. Evidence was also adduced of in-prison employment,\nwith favorable reports by a supervisor, as well as participation in various rehabilitative\nand educational programs. The evidence showed a history of drug use up to a few\nmonths before the hearing on the petition.7\n\n\n\n\nand again in August 2002, prison authorities “validated” defendant as a “drop-out” of the\ngang. At the hearing below, the prosecutor argued that his dropout status increased\ndefendant’s dangerousness by making him a “marked man” who was “going to have to\nengage in defending himself at any given time which . . . given his history, will . . . force\nhim to regain and utilize weapons.” Of course if defendant had not dropped out of the\ngang, his membership would undoubtedly have been cited—far more plausibly—as\nevidence of continuing dangerousness. Catch 22 is no part of our Penal Code.\n       6\n          The trial court’s remarks suggest that it found that defendant must have been the\npossessor of the blade because the record contains self-exculpatory statements by the\nother three participants. One of the participants reportedly said, “I had to, the dude pulled\na blade on me.” However we see nothing in the record identifying “the dude,” and of\ncourse to draw any inference from any of the participants’ statements requires the\nsupposition, for which no evidence appears, that the speaker was speaking truthfully. We\nfind nothing in the records of this incident that could reasonably be characterized as\nreliable evidence that defendant was its author. (See pt. V, post.)\n       7\n         Defense counsel argued below that the 2006 assault had inflicted painful injuries\nwhich prison medical authorities treated with opiates, thus triggering the addiction, or\nrelapse, which preceded the hearing.\n\n                                              6\n\f       The trial court denied the petition on May 19, 2014, finding “nothing right up until\nthe most recent triggering offense to suggest to this Court that the petitioner presents\nanything but a substantial risk to public safety.” Defendant took this timely appeal.\n\n       F. Proposition 47.\n\n       While the appeal was pending, on November 4, 2014, the electorate enacted the\nSafe Neighborhoods Act. It reclassified certain drug and theft related felonies as\nmisdemeanors and, mirroring the Reform Act, provided for recall of sentences already\nbeing served for the reclassified offenses. The resentencing provision, Penal Code\nsection 1170.18 (§ 1170.18), echoes section 1170.126 in directing that the petitioner\n“shall be . . . resentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Id., subd. (b) (§ 1170.18(b).) But it goes on, as the Reform Act had not, to define this\nphrase: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’\nmeans an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the\nmeaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667.” (§ 1170.18(c), italics added.) The cross-referenced section sets forth a\nlimited list of “violent felony” offenses, sometimes known as “super strikes.” (See\nCouzens, et al., Prop47FAQs.pdf (November 2015), <http://www.courts.ca.gov/\ndocuments/Prop47FAQs.pdf> (as of Jun. 20, 2016).) The effect of the new definition is\nto require resentencing unless the court finds an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will\ncommit a super strike. The question here is whether defendant may avail himself of this\nnarrowed definition. Basic principles of statutory construction compel the conclusion\nthat he can.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f I.    Applicability of Section 1170.18(c)\n\n       A. Introduction.\n\n       The central question is whether section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety” applies to that phrase as used in section 1170.126(f).8 On\nthe face of the two statutes the question seems to answer itself: Section 1170.18(c)\ndeclares the definition applicable “throughout this Code.” “This Code” can only mean\nthe Penal Code. Section 1170.126 is part of the Penal Code. Quod est demonstrandum:\nthe definition applies to petitions under section 1170.126, i.e., Proposition 36.\n       It is of course the most fundamental of all principles of statutory construction that\nthe role of the court in applying any statute is to carry out the intent manifested therein.\n(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1858 [“In the construction of a statute or instrument, the office of\nthe Judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained\ntherein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted”]; County\nof Santa Clara v. Escobar (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 555, 562-563; People v. Allegheny\nCasualty Co. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 704, 709 [“If the language contains no ambiguity, we\n\n\n       8\n          A number of decisions have been issued by this and other courts addressing the\napplicability of section 1170.18(c) to Reform Act petitions. Most cannot be cited, either\nbecause they were unpublished to begin with or because the Supreme Court has granted\nreview. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 8.1115(a), 8.1105(e)(1).) One exception is\nPeople v. Esparza (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 726, 734-737 (Esparza), in which the author\nof this opinion, together with the dissenting author and another member of the court,\nrejected arguments similar to defendant’s. The concurring justice has also concurred in\nthe result in some (not citable) cases on the ground that while section 1170.18(c) applies\nby its terms to Reform Act petitions, it does not apply to petitions which were filed or\ndecided before its effective date. It must suffice to say that additional information and\nfurther reflection have led the majority to view as unsound the analysis in those and other\ncases reaching conclusions inconsistent with the ones we reach here. “The words of the\naphorism quoted by Justice Rutledge in his dissent in Wolf v. Colorado (1949) 338 U.S.\n25, 47, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 1368, 93 L.Ed. 1782, are appropriate: ‘Wisdom too often never\ncomes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.’ ” (Tapia v.\nSuperior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 282, 303 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).)\n                                              8\n\fpresume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute\ngoverns.”].)\n       Respondent offers four arguments for a contrary conclusion, three of which are\nincorporated by lengthy quotation from a case that can no longer be cited. (See fn. 8,\nante.) The four arguments are: (1) section 1170.18(c) applies by its terms only to\npersons seeking resentencing under the Safe Neighborhood Act’s retroactive provisions;\n(2) the effect of section 1170.18(c) on Reform Act petitions was not mentioned in the\nballot pamphlet and thus cannot have been intended by voters; (3) the “timing” of the\nSafe Neighborhood Act makes an intent to alter the Reform Act “illogical”; and\n(4) applying the new definition to Proposition 36 petitions contravenes the declaration in\nProposition 47 that “[n]othing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or\nabrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act”\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (n)). These arguments do not, singly or in combination, override the\nplain language of section 1170.18(c).\n\n       B. Use of “Petitioner.”\n\n       We find somewhat bewildering the argument that section 1170.18(c) applies by its\nterms only to petitioners under the Neighborhoods Act. This conclusion is said to flow\nfrom “the plain language of Proposition 47,” in that the definition refers to “the\npetitioner,” which according to respondent can only mean a petitioner under\nsection 1170.18. The statute thus “substantively limit[s]” the definition to Proposition 47\npetitions.\n       This argument cannot withstand scrutiny. If anything, the use of “petitioner” is\nfurther evidence (see pt. I(C), I(F), post) that the drafters had Proposition 36 applicants—\nwho are also “petitioner[s]”— in mind when they adopted a new and narrower definition\nfor a phrase used in that earlier measure. Given the explicit directive to apply this\n\n\n                                             9\n\fdefinition “throughout this Code,” respondent’s argument could at best give rise to an\ninternal ambiguity or contradiction which would have to be resolved in favor of the latter\nphrase as the more definite and concrete expression of legislative intent. But this would\nassume that some clear textual basis could be found for respondent’s reading. The\ndirective that the definition apply “throughout this Code” actually appears in the statute,\nwhile the language imputed by respondent does not. There is thus no ambiguity or\nconflict to resolve. By unmistakable directive, the definition is to apply wherever the\ndefined phrase appears. As it happens, the defined phrase appears in only one other\nplace—the Reform Act—where it is relevant to determine a “petitioner’s” right to relief.\nIt is therefore applicable by its plain terms to this proceeding.\n\n       C. Voter Understanding.\n\n           1. No Presumption of Voter Ignorance.\n\n       The no-longer citable decision quoted by respondent states its chief rationale as\nfollows: “[B]ecause Proposition 47’s ballot materials and proposed statutory language\ncontained nothing whatsoever to suggest that Proposition 47 would have any impact on\nthe resentencing of anyone who was serving a sentence for a crime other than one of the\nspecified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes, it is inconceivable that voters\nintended for subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 to severely restrict the ability of a court to\nreject a resentencing petition under the Reform Act by a person convicted of crimes other\nthan one of the specified property or drug crimes and whom the court considered\ndangerous. The Proposition 47 ballot materials contained no mention of such a possible\nconsequence . . . .” (First and fourth italics added.)\n       This passage exemplifies two rhetorical devices generally employed to obscure\nrather than illuminate the truth. The first known as “honor by association,” in which a\nfalse statement is coupled to a true one in hopes that the latter’s luster will attach to the\nformer in the mind of the listener. It appears here in the coupling of the phrase “and\n                                              10\n\fproposed statutory language” with “ballot materials.” It is true that the ballot materials\ncontain no reference to the measure’s effect on Proposition 36 petitions. But it is patently\nfalse that the statutory language contained “nothing whatsoever to suggest that\nProposition 47 would have any impact” on persons serving sentences for crimes other\nthan those for which Proposition 47 reduced the penalty. By its plain terms, the statute\nwould apply “throughout this Code,” which would include anywhere else the defined\nphrase was used. The attempt to grant substance to a contrary premise by coupling it to a\ntrue statement says more about the insecurity of the speaker’s position than it does about\nthe merits of the controversy.\n       A more serious defect is reflected in the quoted passage’s use of an argumentum\nad ignorantiam, or argument from ignorance, in which the absence of evidence for a\npremise is asserted as proof of the opposite premise. Such an argument is doubly\noffensive when, as here, there is evidence of the disputed premise, i.e., the plain statutory\nlanguage, which is indeed the best, most reliable, and safest evidence of the point at\nissue. The argument’s implicit major premise is that in the absence of affirmative\nextrinsic evidence to the contrary, voters can be presumed not to have understood the\neffects of the measures they adopt, however unmistakably those effects may flow from\nthe language adopted. The court’s reluctance to enunciate this premise—let alone defend\nit—is entirely understandable, since it contravenes fundamental principles of statutory\nconstruction as well as any concept of judicial restraint and, not surprisingly, nearly a\ncentury of precedent.\n       The correct rule is that voters “must be assumed to have voted intelligently upon\nan amendment to their organic law, the whole text of which was supplied each of them\nprior to the election, and which they must be assumed to have duly considered, regardless\nof any insufficient recitals in the instructions to voters or the arguments pro and con of its\nadvocates or opponents accompanying the text of the proposed measure.” (Wright v.\n\n                                             11\n\fJordan (1923) 192 Cal. 704, 713.) This principle has been reaffirmed through the years:\n“Petitioners’ entire argument that, in approving Proposition 8, the voters must have been\nmisled or confused is based upon the improbable assumption that the people did not\nknow what they were doing. It is equally arguable that, faced with startling crime\nstatistics and frustrated by the perceived inability of the criminal justice system to protect\nthem, the people knew exactly what they were doing. In any event, we should not lightly\npresume that the voters did not know what they were about in approving Proposition 8.\nRather, in accordance with our tradition, ‘we ordinarily should assume that the voters\nwho approved a constitutional amendment “. . . have voted intelligently upon an\namendment to their organic law, the whole text of which was supplied each of them prior\nto the election and which they must be assumed to have duly considered.” ’ ”9\n(Brosnahan v. Brown (1982) 32 Cal.3d 236, 252 (Brosnahan), quoting Amador Valley\nJoint Union High Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 243-244\n(Amador Valley); see In re Lance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890, fn. 11 [upholding “truth\nin evidence” provision of Proposition 8; “The adopting body is presumed to be aware of\nexisting laws and judicial construction thereof.”].)\n       Here voters—faced with the startling fiscal and human costs of earlier reactions to\ncrime—manifestly concluded that certain classes of prison inmates should never have\nbeen imprisoned in the first place—or in the case of the Reform Act, should not have\nbeen imprisoned for life—and should be therefore be resentenced to punishments better\nsuited to “MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME,” as the proponents of the\n\n\n       9\n          In Wright v. Jordon, supra, 192 Cal. at p. 713, the court spoke only of\namendments to the state’s “organic law,” which is a reference to the state Constitution.\n(See Black’s Law Dict. (10th ed. 2014), p. 1274, col. 2.) However no basis readily\nappears to apply a different rule to purely statutory measures, and indeed the measure at\nissue in Brosnahan included both constitutional and statutory amendments. (See\nBrosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at pp. 242-245.)\n\n                                              12\n\fReform Act loudly proclaimed in the ballot pamphlet. (Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov.\n6, 2012) text of Prop. 36, p. 52.) We must assume that in enacting the Safe\nNeighborhoods Act, with its modification of the grounds on which such relief could be\ndenied—a modification explicitly declared applicable throughout the code—voters\n“knew exactly what they were doing.” (Brosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 252.)\n       A presumption of voter incomprehension is all the more repugnant when the\nmeasure at issue was “extensively publicized and debated.” (Amador Valley, supra, 22\nCal.3d at p. 243.) In Brosnahan, the court rejected a contention that the measure at issue\ncould be denied effect on the ground that its “complexity . . . may have led to confusion\nor deception among voters, who were assertedly uninformed regarding the contents of the\nmeasure.” (Brosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 251.) In addition to the information in the\nballot pamphlet, the court observed, voters had been exposed to “widespread publicity”\nconcerning the measure: “Newspaper, radio and television editorials focused on its\nprovisions, and extensive public debate involving candidates, letters to the editor, etc.,\ndescribed the pros and cons of the measure.” (Id. at p. 252.) As demonstrated below, the\nsame is true of Proposition 47, at least to the extent of newspaper editorials, opinion\npieces, and web pages debating its merits.10 Further, Proposition 47 was far less complex\nthan the measure under scrutiny in Brosnahan, as to which the court rejected the\nsuggestion that complexity alone could vitiate the voters’ objectively manifested will:\n“ ‘Our society being complex, the rules governing it whether adopted by legislation or\ninitiative will necessarily be complex. Unless we are to repudiate or cripple use of the\ninitiative, risk of confusion must be borne.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Fair Political Practices\nCom. v. Superior Court (1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 42.)\n       10\n           In addition to the materials discussed in more detail below, which address the\nspecific effect of Proposition 47 on Proposition 36 petitions, a sample of the many other\narticles reflecting the public debate preceding Proposition 47’s enactment appears in the\nAppendix.\n\n                                             13\n\f       Lawmakers are not only presumed to be aware of the contents of their enactments;\nthey are “ ‘ “deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence,\nand to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof.” ’ ” (People v. Scott (2014) 58\nCal.4th 1415, 1424.) This principle has been applied to voter initiatives; indeed, it has\nbeen specifically applied to Proposition 47. (People v. Scarbrough (2015) 240\nCal.App.4th 916, 925 [court would “deem the voters to have been aware of” judicial\n“interpretation” of good cause provision in Reform Act “when they approved Proposition\n47”].) Thus, “[a]bsent ambiguity, we presume that the voters intend the meaning\napparent on the face of an initiative measure [citation] and the court may not add to the\nstatute or rewrite it to conform to an assumed intent that is not apparent in its language.\n[Citation.]” (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531,\n543.) If the language of a voter-enacted measure is “clear and unambiguous, there\nordinarily is no need for construction. [Citations.] We presume that the voters intended\nthe meaning apparent on the face of the measure, and our inquiry ends. [Citation.]”\n(Woo v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 967, 975; cf. Robert L. v. Superior Court\n(2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 900-901, italics added [“ ‘When the language is ambiguous, “we\nrefer to other indicia of the voters’ intent, particularly the analyses and arguments\ncontained in the official ballot pamphlet.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”]; Amador Valley,\nsupra, 22 Cal.3d 208, 245-246, italics added [“[T]he ballot summary and arguments and\nanalysis presented to the electorate in connection with a particular measure may be\nhelpful in determining the probable meaning of uncertain language.”].)\n       Here no ambiguity appears. That should end the inquiry. This result is mandated\nnot only by the most basic principles of statutory construction, but also by the\nconstitutional separation of powers. In enacting a ballot measure the voters are\nexercising a legislative power no less worthy of respect than that of their representatives\nin Sacramento. (Cal. Const., art. IV, § 1; see Brosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 241,\n\n                                             14\n\fquoting Amador Valley, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 248 [“it is our solemn duty jealously to\nguard the sovereign people’s initiative power, ‘it being one of the most precious rights of\nour democratic process’ ”].).) To nullify statutory language because voters’ attention was\nnot specifically drawn to it in the ballot pamphlet strikes at the heart of the initiative\npower and, more fundamentally, at the sovereign dignity of the legislative branch. Due\nregard for that dignity requires that when legislative will is expressed in clear language\nwhose effects are not absurd and do not frustrate other positive manifestations of\nlegislative intent, lawmakers—here, voters—must be deemed to have intended the effect\nof their enactments, whatever courts may believe about their subjective expectation,\nunderstanding, or level of insight.\n       This principle, which should be too obvious to need saying, is reflected in\ncountless decisions. For example, in In re Gabriel G. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1428,\n1436, this court rejected a contention that the plain meaning of a statute could be\ndisregarded because it led to unintended consequences: “[W]e must recall that in\nconstruing a statute, ‘that which is construed is the statutory text.’ [Citation.] Evidence\nof legislative inadvertence would have to be quite compelling before we would ignore the\nplain language of the law. [Citation.] The only evidence of inadvertence the Department\noffers is its assessment of the unintended consequences the change will have. Legislation\noften has unintended consequences. But we cannot construe the amendment in a manner\nwholly unsupported by its text merely to avoid the purported unintended consequences.\n[Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 1436-1437, italics added.)\n       The tacit premise of respondent’s argument is that the literal effect of\nsection 1170.18(c) on Reform Act petitions is an unintended consequence which courts\ncan and should avert by refusing effect to the plain statutory language. But a\nconsequence cannot be deemed unintended when the most reliable evidence of intent—\nthe language lawmakers adopted as the objective manifestation of their will—clearly and\n\n                                              15\n\funambiguously directs it. “Courts may, of course, disregard even plain language which\nleads to absurd results or contravenes clear evidence of a contrary legislative intent.”\n(Ornelas v. Randolph (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1095, 1105.) However, in the absence of such a\npredicate, “ ‘there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’ ”\n(Ibid., fn. 8, quoting Delaney v. Superior Court (1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 800.) Since there\nis no evidence that voters intended not to produce the effect in question, courts have no\nlegitimate alternative but to give effect to the statute as it is written.\n\n\n           2. Ballot Pamphlet as Sole Evidence of Voter Understanding.\n\n       If further inquiry into voter intentions were warranted, there would be no sound\nreason to confine it to the contents of the ballot pamphlet, which are constrained by\nconsiderations of space, time, and subjective determinations of materiality. The official\nsummary of any ballot measure is authored by the office of the Legislative Analyst.\n(Elec. Code, §§ 9087, 9086, subd. (b).) The summary is required only to “generally set\nforth in an impartial manner the information the average voter needs to adequately\nunderstand the measure.” (Elec. Code, § 9087, subd. (b), italics added.) Note the\nabsence of any directive that the Legislative Analyst attempt to provide voters with a\ncomplete understanding of the measure, which would be a practical impossibility in any\nevent; few judges or lawyers would be so arrogant as to profess that they completely\nunderstand any provision of law, at least in the sense of being able to forecast all of its\neffects. (See In re Gabriel G., supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1437 [“Legislation often has\nunintended consequences.”].) In manifest recognition of this fact, the governing statute\nstates only that the ballot summary “may contain” such “background information” as “the\neffect of the measure on existing law.” (Elec. Code, § 9087, subd. (b), italics added.)\nThe Legislative Analyst is thus called upon only to make a rational judgment about what\neffects are most likely to matter to voters, and to describe them in a fair and intelligible\n\n\n                                               16\n\fway. Inherent in this undertaking is the necessity of informational triage—of\ndetermining what details are necessary to form an “adequate[] understanding[ing],” and\nwhat details may be omitted. The preparer of such a summary necessarily exercises a\ndiscretionary function requiring courts to allow considerable latitude when the result is\nchallenged as incomplete or inaccurate. (See Brennan v. Board of Supervisors (1981)\n125 Cal.App.3d 87, 96 [“Faced with the difficult task of simplifying a complex proposal,\nthe Committee drafted a summary which, if not all-encompassing, at least briefly\ndescribed its major subjects.”].)\n       When the Legislative Analyst fails to mention some effect of a ballot measure, it\nremains open to the measure’s official proponents and opponents to use their space in the\nballot pamphlet to supply any perceived lack. But they too must practice triage; their\narguments are restricted to 500 words to open and 250 words in rebuttal. (See Elec.\nCode, §§ 9062, 9069, cf. id., § 9041.)11 This means the advocates must select a limited\n\n\n       11\n          There seem to be a number of lacunae in the statutes governing ballot\narguments. The cited sections appear in Article 6 of Chapter 1 of Division of the\nElections Code, which is entitled “Arguments Concerning Measures Submitted to\nVoters,” and which seems to address only situations where no supporting or opposing\nargument has otherwise been submitted. There are two references to a “time limit” for\nsubmission of arguments by other members of the public (Elec. Code, §§ 9062, subd. (c),\n9064), but we find no other statute or regulation prescribing such a limit. A chapter\nseemingly addressed to non-initiative measures includes a requirement that supporting\nand opposition arguments be “submitted to the Secretary of State” by a date “to be\ndesignated” by that officer. (Elec. Code, § 9043.) Another statute provides that if\narguments are not submitted by legislators, they may be submitted by interested voters\n“by a date sufficient to meet ballot printing deadlines.” (Elec. Code, § 9044.) The\nSecretary of State is required to begin publicizing the printed pamphlet at least 45 days\nbefore the election. (Elec. Code, § 9094, subd. (b).) The materials constituting the ballot\nmust be delivered to the state printing office “at least 40 days prior to the date for\nrequired delivery to the elections officials as provided in Section 9094.” (Elec. Code,\n§ 9082.) And the proposed contents must be made available for public inspection at least\n20 days before delivery to the printer. (Elec. Code, §§ 9092, 88006.) This suggests that\narguments must be submitted to the Secretary of State at least 105 days before the\n                                            17\n\fnumber of points to include in their ballot pamphlet arguments, relying on other media to\npursue issues deemed of lesser moment. Here, both sides evidently concluded that the\neffect of section 1170.18(c) on Proposition 36 petitions was not a powerful enough\nground of argument to warrant mention in the pamphlet. That decision can hardly furnish\nan occasion for judicial nullification.\n\n\n           3. Public Debate.\n\n       As already noted and as reflected in the Appendix, Proposition 47 aroused a great\ndeal of public debate. Much of it was devoted to various aspects of the measure’s\nprospective reclassification of specified offenses to misdemeanors. But opponents of the\nmeasure also sought to publicize its narrowed definition of dangerousness and the effect\nthat definition would have on other proceedings, specifically including petitions for\nresentencing under the Reform Act. Thus one opposition Web site, as archived 36 days\nbefore the election placed this effect at the top of a list of reasons to vote against the\nmeasure: “Prop 47 will release dangerous Three Strikes inmates. Prop 47 goes far\nbeyond petty crimes. It rewrites our laws to make it easier for violent Three Strikes\nfelons to gain early release. [¶] The Three Strikes reform law (Proposition 36) allowed\ncertain Three Strikes prisoners to petition for early release, as long as they did not pose\n‘an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.’ [¶] Prop 47 would rewrite California\nlaw, including the Three Strikes Reform law, to give the term ‘unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety’ a very narrow definition. [¶] Under the Prop 47 definition, only\nan inmate likely to commit murder, rape, or a handful of other rare crimes like possession\nof a weapon of mass destruction can be kept behind bars as a danger to public safety. [¶]\nIf Prop 47 passes, violent Three Strikes inmates who might commit robbery, assault with\n\nelection. However we have found no indication of any deadline that officer may actually\nhave set with respect to the November 2014 election.\n\n                                              18\n\fa deadly weapon, felony child abuse, arson, kidnapping, spousal abuse, child abduction,\ncarjacking, and scores of other serious felonies will no longer be defined as ‘dangerous’\nunder California law. If the inmate is eligible for early release under either Prop 47 or the\nThree Strikes Reform law, the court will be powerless to stop it.” (Facts - No on Prop 47\n(archived Sept. 28, 2014) <https://web.archive.org/web/20140928005627/http://\nvotenoprop47.org/No_On_Prop_47__Facts.html> (as of Jun 6, 2016).)12\n        Another opposition Web site, accessible only in archived form, listed the effect on\nReform Act petitions in a table, as follows (CALIFORNIANS AGAINST PROP. 47 | No\non Proposition 47 (archived Oct. 8, 2014) <http://web.archive.org/web/\n20141008185016/http://californiansagainst47.com/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016).):\n             Current Law                         Proposition 47                           Implications\n\nUnder the Three Strikes Reform Act     The proposed language in Penal         Many potentially violent individuals\nof 2012 (Proposition 36), Penal Code   Code § 1170.18(c) would require the    will be released–not because they do\n§ 1170.126 provides for resentencing   prosecution to prove, and the court    not pose a violent risk to society, but\npetitioners previously sentenced to    to find, that the defendant is an      because the Act has unreasonably\nlife terms pursuant to the Three       unreasonable risk to society because   limited the scope of what is\nStrikes Law (Penal Code §§ 667(b)-     he or she would likely commit a        considered a risk of danger to\n(i) and 1170.12) whose committing      sexually violent offense, murder,      society and what the prosecution can\noffense was non-violent and non-       certain sex crimes with children       present to counter the defendant’s\nserious.                               under 14, solicitation to commit       eligibility.\n                                       murder, assault with a machine gun\n                                       on a peace officer, possession of\n                                       weapons of mass destruction or a\n                                       crime punishable by death or life\n                                       imprisonment.\n\n\n        Another archived page on the same website recapitulated criticisms leveled against\nProposition 47 by the California District Attorneys Association (CDAA): “[T]he Three\n\n        12\n          This same language continued to appear in versions of the cited web page\narchived as recently as April 14, 2016.

Penal Code §1170.126 requires that when a\npetitioner meets the basic criteria for eligibility, the court shall resentence the offender\nunless the petitioner poses ‘an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.’ . . .\nAlthough this is a demanding standard, it provides a fair balance and allows the\nprosecution and court to rely on several sources and areas of risk to establish that the\nindividual is unsuitable for resentencing. [¶] Penal Code § 1170.18 . . . changes that\nstandard to an altogether unreachable level. [It] . . . would require the prosecution to\nprove, and the court to find, that the defendant is an unreasonable risk to society because\nhe would likely commit one of the listed violent crimes in § 667(e)(2)(C)(iv).\n[¶] . . . [¶] Further, this proposed new definition of ‘dangerousness’ is not limited to only\nthe types of offenders serving terms for crimes affected by this Act, but applies to any\nresentencing permitted by the Penal Code. Proposed Penal Code § 1170.18(c) states, ‘As\nused throughout this Code, “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety[”] means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof [§ 667(e)(2)(C)(iv)].’ (§ 1170.18, subd. c [emphasis added].) By referring to ‘Code,’\n§ 1170.18 would alter the meaning of ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,’ not\nonly as it is applied in § 1170.18 resentencing hearings, but in all other hearings that\nrely on the dangerousness standard throughout the entire Code. As a result, the\nprosecution would face the impossible barrier when opposing resentencing for the Three\nStrikes defendants under Penal Code § 1170.126. [¶] Moreover, for [sic] any of the\nThree Strikes defendants previously denied resentencing based upon a judicial finding of\ndangerousness, may appeal that ruling and request the court now apply this new\nstandard of dangerousness, resulting in a further cost to a court system already struggling\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\ffinancially.” (CALIFORNIANS AGAINST PROP. 47 | About Proposition 47 (archived\nOct. 10, 2014) <https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/\nhttp://californiansagainst47.com/about-proposition-47/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016), italics\nadded; see Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf, <http://www.co.mendocino.ca.us/da/pdf/\nProposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf> (as of Jun 20, 2016) [apparent copy of CDAA\nreport]; Proposition 47: A Cruel Fraud <http://docplayer.net/1464582-Proposition-47-a-\ncruel-fraud.html> (as of Jun. 20, 2016) [same].)\n       Nor did these arguments appear only on opponents’ Web sites.

Prop. 36, enacted by the voters in\n2011 [sic], permits resentencing of certain strike offenders, unless to do so would create\nan ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.’ Broad discretion was given to judges to\ndetermine who would pose such a danger. [¶] Prop. 47 imposes its more restrictive\ndefinition of dangerousness on people sentenced under the three-strikes law.

[¶] If Prop 47 passes, violent Three Strikes\ninmates who commit robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, felony child abuse, arson,\nkidnapping, spousal abuse, child abduction, carjacking, and scores of other serious\nfelonies will no longer be defined as “dangerous” under California law.” (Our Readers\nSay: Police, sheriffs say no to Prop 47 (Oct. 24, 2014)\n<http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/opinion/20141024/our-readers-say-police-sheriffs-\nsay-no-to-prop-47> (as of Jun. 20, 2016), italics added; see San Bernardino County\nPolice Chiefs and Sheriff’s Association says: No on Prop 47 – Highland Community\nNews: Opinion (Oct. 24, 2014) <http://www.highlandnews.net/opinion/san-bernardino-\ncounty-police-chiefs-and-sheriff-s-association-says/article_1d3fb9f8-5bc3-11e4-8c0f-\n47ac194ced49.html> (as of Jun. 20, 2016); County police chiefs, sheriff’s say no on 47 -\nOpinion - VVdailypress.com - Victorville, CA (Oct. 27, 2014)\n<http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20141027/OPINION/141029812> (as of\nJun. 20, 2016.)13\n       13\n         Our researches are necessarily confined to web-accessible sources. We have no\nway of knowing to what extent voters were exposed to similar information through more\nephemeral media such as broadcasting, mailings, handbills, or flyers. (See Prop. 47\n                                             22\n\f       Two of the three signatories to the opposition argument in the ballot pamphlet\nwere associated with public opposition on this ground. (See Ballot Pamp., General Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) (2014 Ballot Pamphlet), argument against Prop. 47, p. 39\n<http://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2014/general/en/pdf/proposition-47-arguments-rebuttals.pdf>\n(as of Jun. 20, 2016).) One, Christopher W. Boyd, was identified in the pamphlet as\n“President, California Police Chiefs Association [(CPCA)].” (Ibid.) The other, Gilbert\nG. Otero, is named as “President, California District Attorneys Association [(CDAA)].”\n(Ibid.) According to online records of campaign contributors, CPCA contributed to the\nlead opposition entity, Californians Against Proposition 47 (CAP47). (California\nSecretary of State – CalAccess – Campaign Finance <http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/\nCampaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1368083&session=2013&view=received> (as of\nJun. 20, 2016).) CAP47 created a website in opposition to the measure, including the\npage described above, which sets forth what it describes as an “extensive evaluation of\nProposition 47 from the [CDAA].” (Californians Against Prop. 47 | About Proposition\n47 (archived Oct. 5, 2014) <https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/\nhttp://californiansagainst47.com/about-proposition-47/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016.)\n       It thus appears that one opposition author was president of an organization that\nwrote and circulated a paper specifically attacking Proposition 47 for its effect on Reform\nAct petitions—including those that had already been adjudicated. Another opponent was\npresident of an organization that contributed to an entity whose Web site highlighted that\n\n\nwould cut penalties for 1 in 5 criminals in California - LA Times (Oct. 11, 2014)\n<http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141012-\nstory.html> (as of Jun 20, 2016 [opponents “have reported raising $288,000 for the No\ncampaign, most of it earmarked to go to companies that send out campaign mail”].) As\njust noted, for example, highly relevant articles appeared in online versions of the\nRedland Daily Facts, the Highland Community News, and the Victorville Daily Press.\nWhile it seems likely that these articles also appeared in the print editions of those\npublications, we have no way of testing that supposition.\n\n                                            23\n\feffect as a reason to vote no. Their failure to cite this effect in the ballot pamphlet\nsupports an inference, not that the effect was too obscure to be noticed, but that\nopponents did not think it a powerful enough argument for inclusion in the limited space\navailable to them. This in turn suggests that by invalidating the plainly expressed will of\nthe voters, we would be handing opponents of the measure a victory they could not, and\nknew they could not, win at the ballot box.\n       In any event, given this public opposition to the measure on the very grounds at\nissue here, it simply cannot be said that voters were unaware of the challenged effect\nwhen they adopted Proposition 47. The reality of course is that some voters were aware\nof it and some were not. It is no proper role of the courts to guess at these numbers or to\nimpose thresholds of voter comprehension which must be met to our satisfaction before\nwe will carry out the terms of voter-enacted legislation. We are constrained by the\nseparation of powers to trust not only the ballot pamphlet, but arguments in the public\nmarketplace of ideas, to ensure that adopted measures reflect the actual will of the voters.\nIn the absence of absurdity, constitutional infirmity, or frustration of an affirmatively\nmanifested purpose, a voter-adopted statute must be given effect according to its plain\nmeaning.\n\n       D. “Illogical Timing.”\n\n       The no-longer-citable decision incorporated in respondent’s brief asserts that\nProposition 47’s “timing” made it “illogical” to suppose that section 1170.81(c) would\napply to Reform Act petitions: “ ‘The Reform Act required petitions to be brought within\ntwo years unless a court concluded that there was good cause for a late-filed petition.\n([Pen. Code,] § 1170.126, subd. (b).) By the time Proposition 47 took effect, only two\ndays remained in the two-year period for filing a Reform Act petition. No rational voter\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fcould have intended to change the rules for Reform Act petitions at the last moment,\nwhen nearly all petitions would already have been filed and most of them adjudicated.”\n       We find this argument badly flawed at multiple levels. In the first place, courts\ncannot deny effect to plain statutory language merely because they find it “illogical” in\nsome unexplained way. The most nearly apposite rule, noted above, is that plain\nlanguage may be overlooked when its literal application would produce absurd results.\n(California Highway Patrol v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 726, 736 [“The\nliteral meaning of unambiguous statutory language ‘may be disregarded to avoid absurd\nresults . . . .”]; Amador Valley, supra, 22 Cal.3d 208, 245 [acknowledging rule in context\nof initiative effecting sweeping constitutional amendment].) The underlying rationale is\nthat the Legislature cannot have intended to bring about an absurdity, so if a literal\napplication has that effect, the statute must fail to accurately express the Legislature’s\ntrue intent. (See Sterling Park, L.P. v. City of Palo Alto (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1193, 1203\n[proposed interpretation “would lead to absurd results the Legislature cannot have\nintended”]; Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1263,\n1281, fn. omitted [“We cannot conclude that our Legislature intended such absurd\nresults.”]; Simmons v. Ghaderi (2008) 44 Cal.4th 570, 586 [unambiguous statutes must be\napplied as written “unless the statutes cannot be applied according to their terms or doing\nso would lead to absurd results, thereby violating the presumed intent of the\nLegislature”].)\n       There is nothing even remotely “absurd” about giving effect to the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) according to its plain meaning. Indeed, we see nothing illogical about\nit. Where we do find patent illogic is in the tacit, unexplained assumption—contrary to\nthe opinions of the measure’s opponents, as described above—that the newly adopted\ndefinition of dangerousness could only apply in cases not yet filed or, at most, not yet\nadjudicated. The quoted decision acknowledged, only to ignore, the flexible deadline for\n\n                                              25\n\fProposition 36 petitions, i.e., “within two years after the effective date of the act that\nadded this section or at a later date upon a showing of good cause.” (Pen. Code,\n§ 1170.126, subd. (b), italics added.) We think it highly likely that the adoption of a new\nstandard governing dangerousness determinations, if otherwise applicable to a petition,\nwould be held to provide “good cause” for its later presentation. But the question is\nalmost certainly academic because it is probably true that, as the quoted decision\nacknowledged, nearly all Proposition 36 petitions would already have been filed when\nProposition 47 took effect.14 The two-year limitation could have no impact on those\npetitions because they had been filed within the allotted time. All or nearly all of those\npetitions were probably on appeal when Proposition 47 took effect. The question before\nvoters, then, was not whether any Proposition 36 petitions remained unadjudicated but\nwhether the benefits of the new definition should extend to petitions that had already\nbeen adjudicated. We discuss that question in part I(F), post.\n\n       E. Finality of Judgments.\n\n       Respondent also adopts a passage from the above-mentioned uncitable decision in\nwhich the court concludes that literal application of section 1170.18(c) is barred by\nanother subdivision of the same section declaring that “[n]othing in this and related\nsections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not\nfalling within the purview of this act.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.18, subd. (n)\n\n\n       14\n          Of course, the court’s implicit admission that a few petitions might remain\nunfiled or unadjudicated is also fatal to its reasoning. A statute cannot be denied effect\non the ground that a court finds the number of beneficiaries too small to justify relief.\nThere is nothing “illogical” about extending a remedy to less than the entire universe of\npersons to whom it might have been extended. Nor is there anything “practical” about\nrefusing effect to a provision that, by its plain terms, has such an effect. That there are\ntoo few life rafts means some may drown, not that all must do so. A contrary conclusion\nwould require a far more substantial explanation than appears in the quoted decision.\n\n                                              26\n\f(§ 1170.18(n)).)15 The first flaw in this reasoning is that insofar as section 1170.18(c)\napplies to petitions brought under the Reform Act, those petitions are within the statute’s\n“purview,” i.e., its “limit, purpose, or scope.” (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dict. (10th\ned. 1999) p. 950.) Second, the application of section 1170.18(c) to Reform Act petitions\ndoes not “diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments” in those cases. If defendant’s\npetition here is ultimately granted, whether or not section 1170.18(c) plays a material role\nin that outcome, it will be the Reform Act itself that has “diminish[ed] or abrogate[d] the\nfinality” of his conviction by requiring that he be resentenced unless found to present an\nunreasonable danger. Proposition 47 now supplies the test to be applied in determining\nthe latter issue, but it is not Proposition 47 that impairs the finality of his original\nconviction. That is the Reform Act’s doing. The petitioner in such a case is not invoking\nProposition 47 as a basis to reopen or attack the judgment, but as the source for the rule\nof decision governing a subsidiary issue, in accordance with Proposition 47’s plain terms.\nComplying with that mandate does not “diminish or abrogate” the original judgment,\neven if it proves dispositive of the petition. It is still the Reform Act, not Proposition 47,\nthat impairs the finality of his sentence.\n       Had the drafters and voters intended to achieve the result urged by respondent,\nthey could have simply replaced “throughout this Code” with “in this act” in\nsection 1170.18(c). We must give effect to all of the language chosen by the voters,\nincluding the directive that section 1170.18(c)’s definition of dangerousness govern\ndeterminations of that issue in Proposition 36 proceedings.\n       15\n           The quoted passage states, “ ‘Applying section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition throughout the Penal Code would necessarily ‘diminish or abrogate the finality\nof judgments’ in cases, like those subject to the Reform Act, that do not fall ‘within the\npurview of’ Proposition 47. Defendant’s petition under the Reform Act, like most such\npetitions, seeks to abrogate the finality of a Three Strikes judgment in a case that does not\ninvolve one of the . . . crimes [specified in Proposition 47]. Thus, under section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (n), ‘[n]othing’ in section 1170.18 was intended to apply to his petition.’ ”\n\n                                               27\n\f       We conclude that section 1170.18(c) applies to Reform Act petitions by its terms\nand that no meritorious ground has been cited for departing from the plain meaning of\nthose terms. This brings us to the question whether application of that provision to this\nparticular case would offend the presumption against giving retroactive effect to statutory\nprovisions.\n\n       F. Retroactive Effect.\n\n          1. Effect of Estrada and Brown.\n       In his opening brief defendant anticipated an objection based on the presumption\nagainst retroactivity, as follows: “The general rule is that a new statute which lessens\npunishment will be applied to a non-final judgment. (In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740,\n748 (Estrada).) The exception to the rule is that a statute will not be given retroactive\neffect when it contains a savings clause. (Id.) In this instance, there is no savings clause\nin section 1170.18 with respect to the operation of the new definition of ‘unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety.’ ”\n\n       Respondent counters that the absence of an express retroactivity clause renders\nsection 1170.18(c) unavailable to persons in defendant’s position, and that Estrada was\ninapplicable in light of its interpretation in People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 324-\n325 (Brown).\n       The briefs thus echo a number of cases which have addressed the question of\nretroactivity as if it were a matter of choosing between Estrada and Brown.\nWe find this framing of the issue inadequate. In Estrada, while the defendant was\nawaiting sentencing for an escape from custody, the underlying statute was amended to\nreduce the minimum sentence and eliminate a restriction on parole eligibility. The court\nheld that he was entitled to the benefit of the amendment: “When the Legislature amends\na statute so as to lessen the punishment it has obviously expressly determined that its\nformer penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for\n\n                                             28\n\fthe commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature\nmust have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now deemed to\nbe sufficient should apply to every case to which it constitutionally could apply. The\namendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts\ncommitted before its passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is\nnot final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to conclude that\nthe Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a conclusion not permitted in\nview of modern theories of penology.” (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d 740, 745.)\n       For some time, Estrada was understood to create a presumption, counter to a more\ngeneral presumption against statutory retroactivity, that a penal statute reducing criminal\npenalties would operate in favor of all defendants whose convictions were not yet final.\n(See 1 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (4th ed. 2012) Introduction to Crimes, § 49,\npp. 89-90.) However, Brown placed an important limitation on this counter-presumption.\n(Brown, supra, 54 Cal.4th 314.) The defendant there sought to take advantage of a\nliberalized formula for calculation of conduct credits for confinement in local custody.\nFinding no indication that the Legislature intended to grant credits retroactively, the court\nheld that the statute operated to increase credits only for time in custody after its effective\ndate. The defendant argued, among other things, that a contrary conclusion was\nwarranted by Estrada. The court limited Estrada’s counter-presumption to cases where a\nstatute “mitigat[es] the punishment for a particular criminal offense.” (Id. at p. 324,\nitalics added.)\n       Assuming this limitation operates here to make Estrada inapplicable, it means\nonly that Estrada’s presumption in favor of retroactive application does not aid\ndefendant. It does not follow that the statute does not operate retroactively. As the\nBrown court acknowledged at the outset of its analysis, “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative\n\n                                               29\n\fintent.” (Brown, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 319; see People v. Nasalga (1996) 12 Cal.4th\n784, 792 [“To ascertain whether a statute should be applied retroactively, legislative\nintent is the ‘paramount’ consideration.”]; Evangelatos v. Superior Court (1988) 44\nCal.3d 1188, 1206 [“Because the question whether a statute is to apply retroactively or\nprospectively is, in the first instance, a policy question for the legislative body which\nenacts the statute, before reaching any constitutional question we must determine\nwhether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, Proposition 51 should properly be\nconstrued as prospective or retroactive.”].) It thus remains to determine whether the\npresumption against retroactive effect applies here or whether the presumption is\novercome by evidence of legislative intent to the contrary. Estrada’s counter-\npresumption need not, and does not, enter into our analysis.\n       We have concluded that section 1170.18(c) must be held available to defendant\nand others in his position for at least seven partly interlocking reasons: (1) the language\nand structure of section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c), strongly indicate that they were\ndeliberately aimed at Proposition 36 petitions, with the intention of reducing the number\nof denials of relief in those cases; (2) such a purpose implies a legislative finding that the\nprior regime was unduly restrictive, resulting in the denial of relief where relief should\nhave been granted; (3) failing to apply the statute to cases such as this one would largely\nor entirely thwart the intent thus manifested, because all or nearly all petitions that could\nhave been brought under Proposition 36 would have already been heard when the new\ndefinition took effect; (4) to the extent the statute might still reach a few unadjudicated\npetitions, it would be absurd to reward them for delayed filing while punishing prisoners\nwho acted speedily to seek relief under Proposition 36; (5) the overarching purposes of\nboth Proposition 36 and Proposition 47 support the conclusion that the latter’s\nmodification of the former was intended to operate retroactively; (6) retroactive effect\nwould also ensure that Proposition 36 achieved the cost savings it was intended to yield;\n\n                                              30\n\fand (7) the statute was ameliorative or curative in intent, i.e., it was designed to remedy\nan undesirable consequence of prior law, and this characteristic also favors retroactive\napplication;\n            2. Presumption Against Retroactivity.\n\n       It is a longstanding presumption in Anglo-American law that statutes operate only\nprospectively unless a contrary intent clearly appears. (See U.S. v. Heth (1806) 7 U.S.\n399, 413 (opn. of Paterson, J.) [“Words in a statute ought not to have a retrospective\noperation, unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative, that no other meaning can be\nannexed to them, or unless the intention of the legislature cannot be otherwise\nsatisfied.”].) California law as pronounced by our Supreme Court seems to diverge from\nthe common-law presumption in a number of respects. However that is the law by which\nwe are bound, and which we shall undertake to apply.\n       California courts have pronounced a number of competing and even conflicting\nrules for determining whether applying a statute to a given case contravenes the\npresumption. We extract from these cases the principle that a statute will be denied effect\nin a given case if (1) the effect would be “ ‘retroactive’ ” for purposes of the\npresumption; and (2) an intent to bring about such an effect is not clearly manifested in\nthe statute. (See Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319, quoting Evangelatos v. Superior\nCourt, supra, (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1208 [presumption is negated by “ ‘ “express\nlanguage or [a] clear and unavoidable implication” ’ ” of intent to operate retroactively];\ncf. ibid., quoting Evangelatos v. Superior Court, supra, at pp. 1208-1209 [“ ‘in the\nabsence of an express retroactivity provision, a statute will not be applied retroactively\nunless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that the Legislature . . . must have intended a\nretroactive application’ ”].)16\n\n       16\n           The the last-quoted passage is potentially mischievous if taken to require\nextrinsic evidence of retroactive intent whenever lawmakers fail to expressly declare such\n                                             31\n\f       We will assume for purposes of our analysis that applying section 1170.18(c) to\ndefendant’s petition would indeed constitute a retroactive effect subject to California’s\nversion of the common-law presumption. We note, however, that this proposition is not\nreadily harmonized with the presumption’s rationale. (See Sekt v. Justice’s Court of San\nRafael Tp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 297, 308 [“Where the reason for the rule ceases the rule\nshould not apply.”]; Civ. Code, §§ 3510, 3511.) The common-law presumption is\ngenerally understood to rest on the same principle as the constitutional prohibitions\nagainst ex post facto laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts: there is a great\nrisk of unfairness in applying a new law so as to diminish rights or enlarge obligations\nthat arose prior to the enactment of the law. (See California Trout, Inc. v. State Water\nResources Control Bd. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 585, 609, italics added [“Application of a\nstatute is retroactive only when it gives a different and potentially unfair legal effect to\nactions taken in reliance on the preenactment law.”]; Mahon v. Safeco Title Ins. Co.\n(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 616, 620-621, [“The point of the rule disfavoring retroactivity is\nto avoid the unfairness that attends changing the law after action has been taken in\njustifiable reliance on the former law. [Citation.] Hence, the characterization of the\napplication of a statute as retroactive depends on the propensity for unfairness.”].)17 Thus\n\nintent. Such a rule would imbue “extrinsic sources” with a greater dignity than the text\nitself. To illustrate its unsoundness one need only posit a measure awarding cash grants\nto the victims of a natural disaster, but failing to declare itself retroactive. Such a statute\nmust clearly operate retroactively, at least in the same sense and to the same extent as the\nstatute now before us; otherwise it cannot operate at all. To require “extrinsic sources” to\nthis effect would be absurd. What is apparently meant by the quoted language is that\nextrinsic sources alone cannot justify retroactive operation unless they do so very plainly.\n       17\n           The leading treatise on statutory construction likewise notes that the common-\nlaw presumption rests on a perception that “retroactive application of new laws is usually\nunfair.” (2 Singer et al., Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction (7th ed. 2009)\n(Sutherland), § 41:2, p. 386, fn. omitted, italics added.) It describes the scope of the\npresumption as depending on “under what circumstances, for what purposes, with what\neffects, and to what extent, unfairness results from the time frame within which a\n                                              32\n\fthe presumption has often been described as arising only when a statute impairs rights or\nenlarges liabilities that arose under prior law. (I.N.S v. St. Cyr (2001) 533 U.S. 289, 321\n[“A statute has retroactive effect when it ‘ “takes away or impairs vested rights acquired\nunder existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new\ndisability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.” ’ ”]; Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products (1994) 511 U.S. 244, 267 [“When . . . the statute contains no . . . express\ncommand, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive\neffect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\nparty’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions\nalready completed.”].)\n       It is difficult to see how a statute reducing punishment for past convictions can\never be said to “impair a right a party possessed,” “increase a party’s liability for past\nconduct,” or “impose new duties” on anyone. (See Sutherland, supra, § 41:2, p. 389, fn.\nomitted [“It is not unfair for a law retroactively to confer benefits . . . unless it arbitrarily\ndeprives some people of the benefits.”].) Nonetheless California cases, particularly in the\ncriminal context, have repeatedly applied a presumption against statutory retroactivity\nwithout regard to whether it impaired anyone’s rights, enlarged anyone’s liabilities, or\notherwise inflicted any appreciable harm on anyone, unfairly or otherwise. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Harmon (1960) 54 Cal.2d 9, 25-26 [presumption barred defendant from\ninvoking later reduction in punishment for offense of which he was convicted]; Estrada,\n\n\nretroactive statute exerts its influence. Retroactivity may be a factor in court decisions in\neither of two ways. It may be asserted that an act’s retroactivity makes it so unfair as to\nrender it invalid on constitutional grounds. Or, the unfairness that would attend\nretroactive application may be a reason to construe it only prospectively.” (Sutherland,\nsupra, § 41:2, p. 391, fns. omitted; see id., § 41:5, p. 439, fn. omitted [“Even where a\nconstitution explicitly and unqualifiedly prohibits enactment of retrospective statutes,\ncourts usually strike down only those statutes whose retroactivity results in measurable\nunfairness.”].)\n\n                                               33\n\fsupra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 742 [overruling Harmon while endorsing general applicability of\npresumption]; Brown, supra, 54 Cal.4th 314 [applying presumption to statute increasing\nconduct credits]; but see Tapia v. Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.3d 282, 300-301\n[withholding presumption from statutory amendments benefiting defendants].)18 Under\nconstraint of these authorities we will assume arguendo that the effect sought by\ndefendant—to apply section 1170.18(c)’s dangerousness test to his petition—is subject to\nthe statutory presumption. We nonetheless find the presumption rebutted by clear\nevidence that section 1170.18(c) was intended to apply to cases such as defendant’s.\n            3. Statutory Text.\n\n       We find in the text of section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c), several clear\nmanifestations of an intention to reach petitions for resentencing not only under\nProposition 47 but also under the Reform Act. The most obvious of these is the\ndeclaration that the new test of dangerousness is to apply “throughout this Code.”\n(§ 1170.18(c).) The defined phrase (“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety”)\nappears at only one other location in the Penal Code: section 1170.126(f), which governs\npetitions for resentencing under the Reform Act. The enunciation of a definition to apply\n“throughout this Code” can only have been intended to reach those proceedings.\n       This conclusion is reinforced by further examination of the relevant language. It\nwill be recalled that as adopted, the Reform Act required resentencing unless the court\ndetermined that it would pose “an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(§ 1170.126(f).) This language was understood to vest trial courts with “broad discretion\n\n       18\n          To be sure, our Supreme Court has sometimes used language echoing the\nnarrower conception of what effects will trigger the presumption against retroactivity.\n(See Californians For Disability Rights v. Mervyn’s, LLC (2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 231\n[acknowledging argument that application of law would not be “ ‘retroactive,’ as we have\ndefined the term, because such application does not change the legal consequences of\npast conduct by imposing new or different liabilities based upon such conduct”].)\n\n                                            34\n\fto find dangerousness.” (Esparza, supra, 242 Cal.App.4th 726, 739; cf. People v. Flores\n(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1074-1075 [rejecting vagueness challenge].)\n       The drafters of Proposition 47 manifestly concluded that a narrower test was\nneeded. They thus mandated resentencing unless the court found “an unreasonable risk\nthat the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (§ 1170.18(c),\nitalics added.) But if their intent was only to make this the test governing Proposition 47\npetitions, they could have simply incorporated it directly into section 1170.18(b). Instead\nthey first borrowed the exact phrase used in Proposition 36, and then redefined that\nphrase to give it a new meaning (§ 1170.18(c).) There was no reason to incorporate the\nearlier phrase if the intent was only to grant narrower discretion under Proposition 47\nthan courts were exercising under the Reform Act. Such a regime would require only\nthat section 1170.18(b) mandate resentencing unless the court found an unreasonable risk\nthat the petitioner would commit a violent felony. In other words, the old phrase could\nsimply have been replaced by the new one. This was the most obvious way to draft the\nstatute—assuming an intent to apply only to Proposition 47 cases—and it would have had\nat least three virtues: simplifying section 1170.18 by eliminating any need for a separate\ndefinition, shortening it by omitting subdivision (c), and obviating any confusion over the\napplicability of the new test to Reform Act petitioners. That the drafters instead lifted the\noperative language from the Reform Act and then redefined it in a substantially narrower\nway is an indication that their very purpose was to alter the rule in Reform Act\nproceedings so as to constrain the discretion courts had been exercising in those cases,\nand to correct the resulting denials of relief.\n       “[I]n reviewing the text of a statute, [courts] must follow the fundamental rule of\nstatutory construction that requires [that] every part of a statute be presumed to have\nsome effect and not be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary. ‘Significance\n\n                                               35\n\fshould be given, if possible, to every word of an act. [Citation.] Conversely, a\nconstruction that renders a word surplusage should be avoided. [Citations.]’\n[Citations.]” (People v. Arias (2008) 45 Cal.4th 169, 180.) Here, the construction\nadvocated by respondent would render not merely a word, but an entire phrase\nsuperfluous. If Proposition 47 does not alter the standard applicable in Proposition 36\ncases, the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” performs no useful\nfunction in Proposition 47; its only effect is to needlessly complicate and lengthen the\nstatute. By understanding that phrase as directly aimed at Proposition 36 proceedings, we\ngive it the only meaning and effect it can have. We conclude that its very purpose is to\ncorrect an unduly parsimonious judicial treatment of Proposition 36 petitions. As will\nappear, that intent compels the conclusion that it was also intended to govern petitions\nthat had already been filed and denied in the trial court.\n          4. Overarching Retroactive Intent.\n\n       The resentencing provisions in both Proposition 36 and Proposition 47 were\nexplicitly retrospective in intent. Both measures pointedly relieved current prisoners of\npenalties duly imposed on them under prior law. (See People v. Scarbrough, supra, 240\nCal.App.4th 916, 926-927 [“section 1170.18 codifies the voters’ intent to retroactively\nreduce properly imposed punishment for certain criminal offenders”].) Each reflected a\njudgment by the electorate that the prison population included inmates who should not be\nthere, or should not long remain, because they had been imprisoned for life on nonviolent\noffenses (Proposition 36) or because they were imprisoned for “petty” offenses\n(Proposition 47). The proponents of Proposition 36 argued, and voters impliedly found,\nthat these remissions of sentence were necessary to “MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT\nTHE CRIME” and thereby conserve “[p]recious financial and law enforcement\nresources” that were being “improperly diverted to impose life sentences for some non-\nviolent offenses.” (Ballott Pamp., Gen. ELec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of Prop. 36, at p. 52.)\n\n                                             36\n\fThis point was repeated in the rebuttal to the opponents’ argument, along with the\nstatement, “People convicted of shoplifting a pair of socks, stealing bread or baby\nformula don’t deserve life sentences.” (Id. at p. 53, italics added.) The same intent is\nexpressed, more frequently if somewhat less directly, in the arguments supporting\nProposition 47, i.e., it would “[s]top[] wasting prison space on petty crimes and focus[]\nlaw enforcement resources on violent and serious crime by changing low level nonviolent\ncrimes such as simple drug possession and petty theft from felonies to misdemeanors.”\n(Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47 at p. 38, italics added; see ibid.,\nitalics added [“Stops wasting money on warehousing people in prisons for nonviolent\npetty crimes”; id. at p. 39 [rebuttal: “Stops wasting prison space on petty crimes”].)\n(Italics added.)\n       In enacting these two initiatives, voters clearly intended to grant retroactive relief.\nThat is the very gist and essence of the resentencing provisions. We see no coherent\nreason to suppose that this same intent did not inform the decision to adopt, in\nProposition 47, a narrowed test of dangerousness applicable by its terms to Proposition\n36 petitions. We find it inconceivable that voters, having twice decided to extend new\nrights retroactively to current inmates, intended to limit those rights depending upon the\nprocedural happenstance of when a petition was heard in the trial court. (See Falcon v.\nState (Fla.2015) 162 So.3d 954, 962 [noting the “patent unfairness of depriving\nindistinguishable juvenile offenders of their liberty for the rest of their lives, based solely\non when their cases were decided”].)\n           5. Fiscal Effects.\n\n       An intent to apply the new test retroactively is also suggested by the fiscal\npurposes of the two measures. The Legislative Analyst estimated that Proposition 47\ncould realize annual savings “in the low hundreds of millions of dollars” (Ballott Pamp.,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Promp. at p. 37), beginning with “the resentencing of\n\n                                              37\n\finmates currently in state prison,” which “could result in the release of several thousand\ninmates, temporarily reducing the state prison population” (id. at p. 36). Likewise,\nProposition 36 was intended to realize savings estimated at up to $90 million per year by\nshortening future sentences and resentencing current inmates pursuant to\nsection 1170.126. (Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. Nov. 6, 2012) text of Prop. 36 at p. 50\n[Analysis by Legislative Analyst].) Critically, the Legislative Analyst noted that this\nnumber “could be tens of millions of dollars higher or lower depending on several\nfactors,” first among them “the number of third strikers resentenced by the court and the\nrate at which [the Board of Parole Hearings] would have released third strikers in the\nfuture under current law.” (Ibid.) The Legislative Analyst thus recognized—and\ninformed voters—that the rate of denials of Proposition 36 petitions would directly affect\nthe savings actually achieved.\n       As of 2010, a nonprofit institute estimated the annual cost of imprisonment in\nCalifornia at nearly $50,000. (The Price of Prisons | California Fact Sheet.pdf,\n<http://www.vera.org/files/price-of-prisons-california-fact-sheet.pdf> (as of\nJun. 9, 2016).)19 This translates into a cost of one million dollars for every 20 inmate-\nyears. Denial of a Proposition 36 petition means—and was understood by voters to\nmean—that taxpayers would continue to accrue this expense until an inmate died, barring\nearlier release by the Board of Parole Hearings. To that extent every denial impaired the\n\n       19\n          By 2014, some widely circulated estimates were placing the annual cost of\nimprisonment at $60,000 or higher per inmate. (See, e.g., Fewer State Prisoners, Higher\nCost Per Inmate - California Budget & Policy Center (Aug. 7, 2013)\n<http://calbudgetcenter.org/blog/fewer-state-prisoners-higher-cost-per-inmate/> (as of\nJun. 20, 2016 [“California is expected to spend about $60,000 for each inmate in 2013-\n14”]; McKinney, et al., In Response: Proposition 47 adds up |\nSanDiegoUnionTribune.com (Sept. 12, 2014)\n<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/sep/12/in-response-proposition-47-\nadds-up/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016) [“California spends $62,300 to house one inmate\nannually”].)\n\n                                             38\n\ffiscal purpose of both initiatives, i.e., to save money by reducing the prison population.\nGiven the implied finding in Proposition 47 that the earlier measure had granted courts\ntoo much latitude—resulting in the denial of too many petitions—it is entirely rational to\nsuppose that voters intended to relieve themselves of the ongoing costs of those rulings\nby requiring their reexamination under the new, more restrictive standard.\n       Here, defendant had apparently served 17 or 18 years of his 25-to-life sentence\nwhen he petitioned for resentencing. The denial of his petition meant that he would\nspend at least another seven years in prison, at a taxpayer cost of some $350,000. If he\nwere not eventually released by the Board of Parole Hearings, he could easily survive\nanother 20 years, representing a cost upwards of $1 million. Given that this\nimprisonment followed application of a dangerousness test voters had found too broad, it\nis entirely likely that they meant for him to be released unless he were shown to satisfy\nthe new, more rigorous test. Since nothing approaching such a showing is suggested by\nthis record, there is every reason to believe that voters intended the new test to apply to\nhis and similar cases.20\n\n       20\n            Some of the opposition materials alluded to the cost of rehearing Reform Act\npetitions as a reason to vote against Proposition 47. (See CALIFORNIANS AGAINST\nPROP. 47 | About Proposition 47 (archived Oct. 10, 2014)\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/http://californiansagainst47.com/about-\nproposition-47/>, (as of Jun. 20, 2016), italics added; see California District Attorneys\nAssociation, A Look at Proposition47.pdf\n<http://www.co.mendocino.ca.us/da/pdf/Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf> (as of\nJun. 9, 2016); Proposition 47: A Cruel Fraud <http://docplayer.net/1464582-Proposition-\n47-a-cruel-fraud.html> (as of Jun. 20, 2016.) At least one uncitable decision has also\ncited this cost as a reason not to infer an intent by the voters to apply section 1170.18(c)\nretroactively. It does not require an advanced degree in mathematics to discern that the\ncosts of such proceedings pale by comparison to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that\nwill be borne by taxpayers when a petition is denied. The legislative analyst estimated\nthat resentencing proceedings under Proposition 36 could generate costs of “a few million\ndollars . . . over a couple of years.” (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of\nProper 36 at p. 50.) Apparently, some 3,000 prisoners were potentially eligible for\nresentencing; this at any rate is what opponents told voters. (Id. at p. 52, quoting Fresno\n                                             39\n\f           6. Futility of Prospective-Only Application.\n\n       Once it is recognized that Proposition 36 petitioners were intended beneficiaries of\nsection 1170.18(c)’s new definition of dangerousness, it becomes apparent that it must\noperate retroactively or it will have virtually no effect. In this light, the considerations\ncited in the “timing” argument discussed in part I(D), ante, operate in favor of applying\nthe new definition to cases in which a Proposition 36 petition has already been denied.\nThe factual premise of that argument are the two-year deadline for Reform Act petitions\nhad all but expired when Proposition 47 took effect. It therefore stands to reason that\nnearly all eligible inmates would already have filed a Reform Act petition when the new\ndefinition took effect. Indeed most, if not nearly all, would already have been ruled\nupon. This follows not only from the deadline but from simple self-interest. Inmates had\nno apparent reason to delay and every reason to act quickly. Every day an inmate waited\ncould be a needless day of “base durance.” (Henry IV, Part II, act. V, sc. v.) Therefore,\ninsofar as the new definition was intended to apply to Proposition 36 petitions, it must\neither reach petitions that had already been denied in the trial court, or it was doomed to\nhave virtually no effect.\n       Akin to the constructional presumption against superfluous language is a\npresumption that lawmakers do not adopt pointless legislation. (See Barrett v. Dawson\n(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1048, 1054 [“We will not presume the Legislature engaged in a\nfutile act”].) If section 1170.18(c) does not apply to this case, and others like it, it will\napply to few if any Proposition 36 cases. It follows that voters intended the new\n\nBee [“ ‘If Proposition 36 passes, about 3,000 convicted felons serving life terms under\nThree Strikes could petition for a reduced sentence’ ”]; see ‘3 strikes’: Proposed law tries\nto restore intent – SFGate (Nov. 28, 2012) <http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/3-\nstrikes-Proposed-law-tries-to-restore-intent-2296566.php> (as of Jun. 9, 2016.) This\nsuggests an estimated cost per resentencing hearing in the low four figures. Such an\nexpenditure must be deemed negligible as against an annual expense of at least $50,000\nfor continued imprisonment.\n\n                                               40\n\fdefinition to apply to as many Proposition 36 petitions as possible, which certainly\nincludes any in which an order of denial was not yet final.21\n          7. Perversity of Prospective-Only Application.\n       In answer to the foregoing reasoning it might be suggested that a handful of\nProposition 36 petitions remained unfiled or unadjudicated when Proposition 47 took\neffect, and that section 1170.18(c) was intended to apply only to them. In this view the\nextension of the new definition to Proposition 36 cases was not wholly futile, but only\nmostly futile. Accepting the factual proposition that some petitions remained unheard,\nthe posited intent—to benefit only this small class of petitioners—seems irrational to the\npoint of absurdity or even perversity. By this logic, voters intended to extend the newly\nrestrictive definition of dangerousness to those petitioners who waited until near (or\nbeyond) the end of the two-year limitations period, but to withhold it from those\nprisoners who filed promptly and whose petitions, as a result, had already been denied\nwhen Proposition 47 took effect.\n       Ordinarily the law rewards diligence. (See Civ. Code, § 3527.) The foregoing\nreading would impute to voters an intention to, in effect, punish those who had acted with\nalacrity in seeking the relief voters offered them in Proposition 36. That is, the only\npetitioners likely to glean the benefit of the new enactment would be those—if there were\nany—who had waited to file their petitions until the time to do so had very nearly expired\n(or, on a showing of good cause, beyond that time). This would not only seem to\n\n       21\n          This case presents no occasion to express an opinion on what remedies might\nbe available to those whose petitions were denied on dangerousness grounds and as to\nwhom that ruling has become final. It is at least arguable that section 1170.18(c)\nprovides relief in those cases; certainly the opponents expected it to do so. (See\nCALIFORNIANS AGAINST PROP. 47 | About Proposition 47 (archived Oct. 10, 2014)\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/http://californiansagainst47.com/about-\nproposition-47/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016); see Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf\n<http://www.co.mendocino.ca.us/da/pdf/Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf> (as of\nJun 20, 2016); Proposition 47: A Cruel Fraud <http://docplayer.net/1464582-Proposition-\n47-a-cruel-fraud.html> (as of Jun. 20, 2016.) The question is not presented here,\nhowever, and we do not address it.\n\n                                             41\n\fdiscriminate irrationally against the diligent and in favor of the dilatory; it would also fly\nin the face of the avowed cost-saving purpose of these measures by rewarding those who\nhad, by their delay in seeking relief, diminished the savings taxpayers would realize from\na reduction in their sentences.\n       As we have already noted, in applying a statute courts seek to “ ‘avoid a\nconstruction that would produce absurd consequences, which we presume the Legislature\ndid not intend.’ ” (In re Greg F. (2012) 55 Cal.4th 393, 406; People v. Mendoza (2000)\n23 Cal.4th 896, 908.) Applying a more restrictive standard of dangerousness to\npetitioners who were relatively dilatory in seeking relief, while relegating others to\nadditional years of confinement at public expense even though the same standard might\nhave required their release as well, can readily be characterized as an absurd result which\ncounsels in favor of construing the statute literally to the benefit of defendant and all\nothers similarly situated.\n          8. Remedial/Ameliorative Purpose.\n\n       The leading treatise on statutory construction identifies “three circumstances\nwhere retroactive application of a statute may be justified: (1) where legislative intent\nexpressly or impliedly indicates retroactive application is desirable; (2) where the statute\nis ameliorative or curative in nature; or (3) where fulfillment of the parties' reasonable\nexpectations may require the statute’s retroactive application.” (2 Sutherland, supra, §\n41:4, p. 423, fn. omitted.) We have already concluded that the first circumstance is\npresent. The same appears true of the second, i.e., that section 1170.18(c)’s modification\nof the dangerousness standard was adopted to ameliorate, cure, or remedy a perceived\ndefect in the standard adopted in Proposition 36. The very fact that voters sharply limited\nthe kind of dangerousness that would justify denial of resentencing implies dissatisfaction\nwith the manner in which courts had exercised the broad discretion granted them by the\noriginal test as adopted in Proposition 36. Voters impliedly found that courts had\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\fwrongly denied some number of Proposition 36 petitions by too readily finding that the\npetitioners presented an unreasonable risk of danger.22\n       To be sure, “a remedial purpose does not necessarily indicate an intent to apply the\nstatute retroactively.” (Evangelatos v. Superior Court, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1213.) It\nwill, however, contribute to an inference of such intent consistent with the more general\nprinciple that such statutes are “entitled to liberal construction in order to achieve full\nfruition of their remedial purposes.” (2 Sutherland, supra, § 41:11, at p. 506, fn. omitted;\nsee Hellinger v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1061, citing Kim v.\nServosnax, Inc. (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1346, 1356 [statute extending limitations period\nwas curative and “should be liberally construed”].) Provided no intervening rights are\nimpaired, and no contrary intent appears, such provisions should be more freely applied\nto past events than may be the case with non-remedial statutes. (See River Garden\nRetirement Home v. Franchise Tax Bd. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 922, 946, citing Moran\nTowing Corp. v. Urbach (N.Y.App.Div.2003) 1 A.D.3d 722, 768 N.Y.S.2d 33 [cited\ndecision “[o]bserv[ed] that where legislation is curative, retroactivity may be construed\nliberally”]; Hall v. Fairchild-Gilmore-Wilton Co. (1924) 66 Cal.App. 615, 631, citing\n\n\n       22\n           This case may illustrate the concern reflected in the adoption of\nsection 1170.18(c). The trial court apparently found that defendant posed an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety based on (1) his undoubtedly violent conduct\nas a young gang member nearly four decades ago; (2) his involvement in violent\nincidents in prison for which he was not, on this record, shown to be responsible; and\n(3) evidence of ongoing or recurring issues with substance dependency. Obviously,\nevery third strike prisoner had to incur two or more serious or violent felonies—strikes—\nto be eligible for a third-strike sentence. It is therefore likely that many if not most\nProposition 36 petitioners would have had violent pasts. And while recent aggressive\nconduct in prison would certainly support an inference of current dangerousness, merely\nsuffering violence at the hands of others—which is consistent with the evidence\npresented here—would not. Finally, while chemical dependency may warrant concerns\nabout some sort of criminal conduct, many would question whether, by itself it points to\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n                                              43\n\fBaird v. Monroe (1907) 150 Cal. 560 [presumption against retroactivity not applicable to\ncurative statutes].)\n       We conclude that section 1170.18(c) is applicable to defendant’s case and that\nremand is necessary to permit reconsideration of his petition in light of the definition of\ndangerousness set forth there.\n\nII.    Equal Protection.\n\n       Defendant contends that the scheme enacted by Proposition 36 violates the Equal\nProtection Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions because it reduces the\npunishment for yet-to-be-sentenced defendants regardless of dangerousness, while\nextending relief to current inmates only if their resentencing is not found to pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger. According to defendant, equal protection requires the\napplication of the same standard for defendants seeking resentencing and defendants\ncurrently being sentenced.\n       Equal protection issues arise when it appears that a statute treats similarly situated\npeople differently. If this occurs, and the disparate treatment “creates a suspect\nclassification or impinges on the exercise of a fundamental right,” it is subject to strict\nscrutiny, meaning that it will be upheld “only if it is necessary to further a compelling\nstate interest.” (People v. Silva (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1167.) In other cases, the\ndisparity “will satisfy constitutional requirements if it bears a rational relationship to a\nlegitimate state purpose.” (Ibid.)\n       The first question posed by an equal protection claim is whether the defendant has\nbeen subjected to disparate treatment vis à vis another class of persons that is “ ‘similarly\nsituated for purposes of the law challenged.’ ” (Cooley v. Superior Court (2002) 29\nCal.4th 228, 253, quoting People v. Gibson (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1425, 1438, 252\nCal.Rptr. 56.) Defendant notes that new third-strike offenders and persons currently\n\n\n                                              44\n\fserving third-strike sentences share a common criminal history: “Members of both\ngroups have at least two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies as well as a\ncurrent non-serious, nonviolent offense that would have previously subjected them to a\nThree Strike sentence of 25 years to life.” This makes them “similarly situated” for\npurposes of the Reform Act, he contends, because the goals of that act were “to ‘restore\nthe Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life sentences\nonly when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime’ and to ‘save\nhundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars every year’ by ensuring that the state does not\ncontinue to indefinitely house people serving life sentences for ‘minor crimes.’ ”\n(Quoting Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) Findings and Declarations,\nProposition 36, § 1; at p. 105.) These goals, he asserts, were the same with respect to\nboth past and future offenders.\n       This oversimplifies the rationale of the Reform Act as well as that of the Three\nStrikes law it was intended to reform. The basic premise of the Three Strikes Act was\nthat any person who committed a third felony after being convicted or two or more strike\nfelonies deserved a life sentence. The Reform Act reflects the judgment that a two-strike\nhistory coupled with a non-violent current offense does not necessarily reflect either\nenough culpability or enough dangerousness to justify a life sentence, particularly given\nthe fiscal burdens such a sentence imposes upon the state and its taxpayers. The Reform\nAct reflects a balancing of these three factors—culpability, dangerousness, and cost—in a\nmanner calculated to suitably punish the defendant and adequately protect society while\neasing the financial burdens flowing from the earlier, more vindictive approach.\n       We may assume that current third-strike inmates and new third-strike offenders\nare chargeable with the same level of culpability. However we do not believe they are\nsimilarly situated with respect to the other two factors. Perhaps the least of the\ndifferences—though still very real—is the cost savings to be realized from applying the\n\n                                             45\n\fReform Act to current inmates, as compared to the savings that can be realized with new\noffenders. Defendant, as previously noted, has already served much of his sentence. He\nwill become eligible for parole in a few years. Most of the costs of his sentence are, in all\nprobability, water under the bridge. Were a new offender being currently sentenced on\nan identical record, however, the reduction in his sentence—and resulting savings—\nwould be dramatic: the potential sentence would be reduced from a 25 year minimum to\na 12 year maximum.23 Under the figures previously mentioned, the resulting costs would\nbe reduced from (at least) $1,250,000 to (at most) $600,000. (See pt. I(F)(5), ante.)\n       More significant, however, are the differences between the two groups in the\nstate’s ability to address perceived dangerousness on the part of the offender. An\nappreciation of this point must begin with a review of the role of dangerousness, as\nperceived by the prosecutor and sentencing judge, in determining the punishment to be\nvisited upon a criminal defendant. In commencing a prosecution the prosecutor exercises\nthe prerogative of deciding what to charge and how to charge it. This power is exercised,\npresumably, in light of two primary factors: perceived culpability and dangerousness.\nThe same considerations inform any decision the prosecutor may make with respect to a\nproffered guilty plea to less than all of the charges brought. When the matter comes up\nfor sentencing, the power shifts to the trial court to make discretionary decisions affecting\nthe extent of the defendant’s punishment, perhaps most notably the choice of a base term\n(lower, middle, or upper) and whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences.\nAgain these decisions are likely to be infused with judgments about both culpability and\ndangerousness.\n\n\n\n       23\n          The 12 years would consist of double the three-year maximum base term, plus\nthe six one-year priors which the sentencing court stayed, although they should instead\nhave been stricken. (See People v. Langston (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1237, 1241.)\n\n                                             46\n\f       It follows that whenever a sentence is retroactively reduced by blanket legislation\nsuch as the Reform Act, one result may be to nullify at least some prosecutorial and\njudicial decisions that were intended, at least in part, to protect the public from a\nparticular defendant’s perceived dangerousness. To the extent the perceptions of\ndangerousness were sound—and remain sound when the sentence is reduced—the\nnullification of those actions may expose the public to an unreasonable risk of danger. It\nis these risks which drafters sought to avert by empowering the trial court to deny\nresentencing under the Reform Act upon a finding that the defendant in fact presents an\nunreasonable risk of danger to the public.\n       This circumstance distinguishes current inmates from new offenders. In the case\nof the latter, the prosecutor, followed by the sentencing court, will often still have the\npower to shape a punishment deemed sufficient to address any perceived dangerousness.\nThe Reform Act merely eliminates one tool they possessed under prior law—the power\nto impose a 25-to-life sentence for a non-strike felony.24 The prosecutor may still seek\nconviction of additional or more serious charges or enhancements, and the court can still\nmake sentencing choices, designed to protect the public from the defendant’s perceived\ndangerousness for relatively longer periods. This is a protection that the public does not\nhave under a categorical, across-the-board reduction in sentences already imposed.\n       A similar point is hinted at, though not in the immediate context of an equal\nprotection claim, in People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161 (Yearwood). The\ndefendant there had been sentenced about a year before the adoption of the Reform Act,\n\n\n       24\n           This of course assumes that the facts would not sustain a charge asserting a\nqualifying strike. It is entirely possible that under the prior regime, a prosecutor might\nforego efforts to convict a third-striker of a serious or violent felony—perhaps as part of a\nplea arrangement—because some lesser offense could still yield a 25-to-life sentence.\nShould such a case arise in the wake of the Reform Act, the prosecutor may avoid the\neffects of that act by seeking and obtaining a conviction of the serious or violent felony.\n\n                                              47\n\fbut the conviction was not final when that act took effect. He contended that he was\nentitled to be sentenced as a new offender under the act, without being required to invoke\nthe resentencing provisions. In rejecting this contention as a matter of statutory\nconstruction, the court wrote, “Giving amended [Penal Code] sections 667 and 1170.12\nprospective-only application supports the Act’s public safety purpose by reducing the\nlikelihood that prisoners who are currently dangerous will be released from prison due to\nthe Act. During the pretrial, trial and sentencing phases of the criminal justice system,\nvarious discretionary decisions are available to the prosecutor and the trial court that\ncan result in a shorter or longer term of imprisonment (e.g., selection of the appropriate\nbase term, concurrent/consecutive sentencing, dismissal of a strike in the interests of\njustice). Once the defendant is sentenced, prosecutorial and judicial discretion are\neffectively exhausted.” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 176, italics added.) In other words, to\ntreat the defendant as a new offender after he had been sentenced under prior law would\ndeprive the prosecutor and court of the powers they would otherwise have to craft an\noutcome reflecting their sense of the defendant’s dangerousness. The same is true of\ncurrent inmates who invoke the resentencing provisions of the Reform Act. This places\nthem in a materially different position than new offenders, and warrants a treatment of\ntheir cases that takes the question of dangerousness into account.\n       We conclude that defendant has not demonstrated the threshold requirement for an\nequal protection challenge, i.e., that he be situated similarly to the newly charged\ndefendants to whom he compares himself.\n\nIII.   Jury Trial\n\n       Defendant contends that the prosecution was required to prove dangerousness to a\njury beyond a reasonable doubt under the authority of Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000)\n530 U.S. 466, 490 (Apprendi), which held that the federal constitutional rights to a jury\n\n\n                                             48\n\fand to proof beyond a reasonable doubt (U. S. Const. 6th & 14th Amends., § 1) extend to\nthe trial of “any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\nmaximum.” (See People v. Towne (2008) 44 Cal.4th 63, 77 [referring to requirement that\n“a fact exposing a defendant to a higher sentence be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable\ndoubt”].) Defendant contends that since he is eligible for resentencing under the Reform\nAct, the “prescribed statutory maximum” for his offense is now the second-strike\nsentence of double the base term that would be imposed if resentencing were granted. An\nunreasonable risk of danger thus constitutes, he contends, a fact “increas[ing] the\npenalty” to a 25-to-life term. Accordingly, he concludes, that fact must be tried by a jury\nand found, if at all, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       This court has already held that the rule of Apprendi does not apply to a\ndetermination of dangerousness under a Reform Act petition. (Esparza, supra, 242\nCal.App.4th at pages 737-740.) Defendant fails to persuade us that we should reconsider\nthat holding. In Apprendi the question was whether a finding of racially biased\nmotivation, the effect of which was to double the maximum sentence to which the\ndefendant was exposed, could be properly made by a judge rather than a jury. The state\nargued that it was not an element of the offense but a “sentencing factor” which, under\nSupreme Court precedent, need not be found by a jury. (Apprendi, supra, 530 U.S. at\np. 492; see McMillan v. Pennsylvania (1986) 477 U.S. 79, 86, 90 (McMillan).) The\nSupreme Court had signaled its rejection of this distinction in a federal prosecution where\nit held that “under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and\njury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that\nincreases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted\nto a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Jones v. United States (1999) 526 U.\nS. 227, 243, fn. 6.) In Apprendi it reaffirmed this rule, insofar as it involved jury trial and\nreasonable doubt, and applied it to a prosecution under state law. (Apprendi, supra, at\n\n                                              49\n\fpp. 490, 497.) Subsequently the court extended the rule to facts that increase the\nminimum sentence to which a defendant is exposed. (Alleyne v. United States (2013) ___\nU.S. ___ [133 S. Ct. 2151, 2155], overruling Harris v. United States (2002) 536 U.S.\n545.)\n        At its core Apprendi is concerned with the trial of facts that are constitutionally\nindistinguishable from elements of the crime. (See Apprendi, supra, 530 U.S. at p. 494\n[referring to “the constitutionally novel and elusive distinction between ‘elements’ and\n‘sentencing factors’ ”]; id. at p. 478, fn. omitted [noting that distinction was “unknown to\nthe practice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment by court as it existed\nduring the years surrounding our Nation’s founding”].) It seeks to shield, against\nencroachment by the state, the fundamental right not to be subjected to criminal\npunishment unless the state has convinced a jury that the facts prescribed by law as\ngrounds for punishment are true beyond a reasonable doubt. Apprendi bars the state from\nbypassing this shield simply by declaring such a fact to be a “sentencing factor” to be\nfound by a judge.\n        We see no conceptual basis on which to apply this doctrine to the resentencing\nprocedure created by the Reform Act. Here the state, through an act of lenity, has elected\nto reduce a penalty duly imposed under prior law. The fact that the reduction is made to\ndepend on the presence or absence of certain conditions does not make those conditions\nequivalent to elements of the offense. Defendant has already been convicted of the\nunderlying offense; all facts necessary to the imposition of his present sentence were duly\nfound by a jury. The question now is whether the punishment to which that verdict\nsubjected him should be reduced. The existence of a condition precluding its reduction is\nnot a fact necessary to increase his punishment for purposes of Apprendi. For purposes\nof Apprendi, the punishment to which that verdict exposed him was imprisonment for 25\n\n\n\n                                              50\n\fyears to life. A finding that he is too dangerous to permit such a reduction does not\nincrease that punishment.\n       This conclusion is entirely consistent with the origins and core purpose of the jury\ntrial guarantee, as summarized in Apprendi, supra, 530 U.S. at page 477: “[T]he\nhistorical foundation for our recognition of these principles extends down centuries into\nthe common law. ‘[T]o guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of\nrulers,’ and ‘as the great bulwark of [our] civil and political liberties,’ 2 J. Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States 540-541 (4th ed. 1873), trial by\njury has been understood to require that ‘the truth of every accusation, whether preferred\nin the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the\nunanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant's] equals and neighbours . . . .’ 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone)\n(emphasis added).” Here no “accusation” is any longer at issue. The only relevant\naccusation preferred against defendant had already been duly sustained by a jury long\nbefore the present matter arose. The question is not whether some additional accusation\nis true, but whether facts exist that bar him from the benefits conferred by the Reform\nAct.\n       Nor can we conceive of a way in which a procedure such as that under scrutiny\nhere could be used as a tool of tyranny or oppression. In McMillan, supra, 477 U.S. at\npage 88, the court alluded to the possibility of a statute crafted so that the “tail” of a\njudge-found sentencing fact “wags the dog of the substantive offense.” It is easy to see\nthe vice in such a regime, which would take power away from the body to whom it is\nconstitutionally entrusted, and place it in the hands of an agent, or at least affiliate, of the\nstate, from whom the Sixth Amendment was designed to withhold it. We see no way in\nwhich a retroactive lessening of punishment, whether conditional or not, could ever\nachieve a similar effect, wittingly or otherwise.\n\n                                               51\n\f       The question here may also be analogized to one of the points considered in\nPeople v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, where the court considered the viability of\nCalifornia’s regime for sentencing juveniles to life without possibility of parole (LWOP)\nin the wake of Miller v. Alabama (2012) 567 U.S. ___ [183 L.Ed.2d 407, 132 S.Ct. 2455]\n(Miller). Miller held that when imposed for an offense committed below the age of 18, a\nmandatory LWOP sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In Gutierrez the\nstate argued, among other things that an LWOP imposed for a juvenile offense under\nCalifornia law did not offend the Miller rule because California law entitles such an\noffender to petition for resentencing at intervals commencing after 15 years’\nimprisonment. In view of this provision, argued the Attorney General, “the initial\nsentence ‘is thus no longer effectively a sentence of life without the possibility of\nparole.’ ” (People v. Guiterrez, supra, at p. 1386.) The Supreme Court emphatically\nrejected this characterization: “A sentence of life without parole under [Penal Code]\nsection 190.5(b) remains fully effective after the enactment of [Penal Code]\nsection 1170(d)(2). That is why [Penal Code] section 1170(d)(2) sets forth a scheme for\nrecalling the sentence and resentencing the defendant. As the Attorney General notes,\n[Penal Code] section 1170(d)(2) provides juvenile offenders convicted of special\ncircumstance murder with ‘three opportunities to have their sentences of life without the\npossibility of parole changed to a sentence of 25 years to life.’ (Italics added.)” (Ibid.)\n       The same is true here. Defendant’s 25-to-life sentence was and is fully effective\nunless and until his sentence is recalled and a new sentence is imposed. Only after the\nsentence is recalled can it be said that a new statutory maximum comes into play. But the\nsentence cannot be recalled if the court finds that doing so would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety. That condition does not increase defendant’s sentence; if\npresent, it operates only to preserve intact the sentence that was originally imposed on\nhim in full compliance with his right to jury trial.\n\n                                              52\n\f       Accordingly, we reaffirm the conclusion in Esparza that defendant was not\nentitled to a jury finding of dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIV.    Presumption in Favor of Resentencing; Burden of Persuasion.\n\n       Defendant contends that section 1170.126 creates a “strong presumption” in favor\nof resentencing. The supporting argument is long on abstractions and short on concrete\napplication to this case. He does not suggest how such a presumption, if found to exist,\nwould contribute to a finding of error in this case. He simply asserts that there was a\npresumption in favor of resentencing, to which—implicitly—the trial court failed to\naccord proper weight.\n       This court has previously rejected the contention that section 1170.126 creates a\npresumption in favor of resentencing. (Esparza, supra, 242 Cal.App.4th 726, 793;\naccord, Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301-1302.) Again defendant offers no\ncompelling reason to depart from that holding. He asserts that the legal context is similar\nto that which led the Supreme Court to declare that trial courts had only “limited”\ndiscretion to strike prior strikes so as to avoid imposing a third-strike sentence. (People\nv. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 530 (Romero).) In a later decision the\ncourt quoted with approval a Court of Appeal’s statement that such relief was warranted\nonly when “ ‘the sentencing court “conclud[es] that an exception to the [three strikes]\nscheme should be made because, for articulable reasons which can withstand scrutiny for\nabuse, this defendant should be treated as though he actually fell outside the Three\nStrikes scheme.” ’ ” (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 377 (Carmony), quoting\nPeople v. Strong (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 328, 337-338.)25 Defendant suggests somewhat\n\n       25\n          Defendant’s appellate counsel betrays an unfortunate tendency to attribute\nstatements, and even quotations, that do not appear in the cited sources. He quotes\nCarmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at page 378 as characterizing relief under Romero as an\n“extraordinary act,” but that phrase appears nowhere in that opinion. Elsewhere he\ndescribes Proposition 36’s findings and declarations as “stat[ing]” that the measure\n                                             53\n\fobliquely that this amounted to a presumption against striking priors—i.e., in favor of the\npunishment prescribed by the Three Strikes Law—and that section 1170.126(f) in effect\n“reversed” the presumption, so that a finding of dangerousness is disfavored, and\nresentencing is favored.\n       The first problem with this analysis is that we know of no decision which\ncharacterized the regime under Romero as a “presumption.” In Romero itself the court\nused that term only in referring to a quite different proposition, i.e., that the Legislature\nintends to enact constitutionally valid statutes. (Romero, supra, 13 Cal.4th at pp. 509; see\nid. at p. 518.) In Carmony the court referred to (1) an inferred presumption by the\nLegislature that a court acts properly in sentencing a defendant in accordance with the\nThree Strikes Law (Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 376); (2) a presumption that, unless\nshown to have acted irrationally or arbitrarily, the sentencing court has “ ‘ ‘acted to\nachieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a\nparticular sentence will not be set aside on review” ’ ” (id. at pp. 377, quoting People v.\nSuperior Court (Alvarez) (1997) 14 Cal.4th 968, 977-97); (3) a “strong presumption” that\nany sentence conforming to the Three Strikes Law is “both rational and proper” (id. at\np. 378); (4) “ ‘the presumption that a trial court ordinarily is presumed [sic] to have\ncorrectly applied the law’ ” (id. at p. 378, quoting People v. Gillispie (1997) 60\nCal.App.4th 429, 434). Of these only the third resembles the presumption advocated by\ndefendant, and it differs in at least one critical respect: it is an appellate presumption in\n\n\n“represents the electorate’s judgment that second-strike doubling of a sentence provides\nsufficient punishment for offenders whose current offenses are nonviolent.” The nearest\nthing to such a statement in the findings is that the measure would “[r]estore the Three\nStrikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life sentences only when a\ndefendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.” (Ballot Pamp. Gen Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012) Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012, § 1, subd. (2) at p. 105.) Describing\nthat which may be inferred as having been “stated” is not proper—or effective—\nadvocacy.\n\n                                              54\n\ffavor of the trial court’s ruling when that ruling conforms to a statutory default. Here a\ncomparable presumption would favor a decision by the trial court to grant a Reform Act\npetition over the objection that doing so would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the\npublic. Such a presumption might well be said to exist, but it does not assist defendant\nbecause the trial court here ruled against him\n       Defendant also suggests that a presumption in favor of resentencing and against a\nfinding of disqualifying dangerousness arises from the wording of the Reform Act, i.e.,\nthat a petitioning defendant, if eligible for recall of sentence, “shall be resentenced . . .\nunless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126(f), italics added.) He\nasserts that “[u]nder longstanding statutory construction principles, the ‘shall/unless’\nformulation establishes a strong presumption.” But defendant offers no authority for this\nassertion, and we have found none. Instead he discusses United States Supreme Court\ncases concerning the extent to which parole decisions under state law must satisfy federal\ndue process guarantees. These cases may be characterized as holding that the statutory\nlanguage considered in them gave rise to a “presumption” of liberty sufficient to raise due\nprocess protections. (E.g., Board of Pardons v. Allen (1987) 482 U.S. 369, 377-378\n(Allen); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex (1979) 442 U.S.\n1, 11-12 (Greenholtz).) The Montana statute at issue in Allen, supra, 482 U.S. at pages\n376-377, did not employ a “shall/unless” structure but rather required that parole be\ngranted “when” the parole board made certain findings. The Supreme Court nonetheless\nfound that the statute “ ‘creat[ed] a presumption that parole release will be granted’ when\nthe designated findings are made.” (Allen, supra, at pp. 377-378.) The court declared\nthat the same was true of the Nebraska statute it had earlier considered in Greenholtz,\nsupra, 442 U.S. at page 11, which did employ a “shall/unless” construction.\n\n\n\n                                               55\n\f        However we are not persuaded that the “presumptions” found in those cases have\nany bearing on this matter. They are not concerned with the principles governing the trial\ncourt’s determination of any issue, or those governing appellate review of such an issue.\nRather they consider whether the state parole laws at issue gave rise to such a “legitimate\nexpectation of release” (Greenholtz, supra, 442 U.S. at p. 12) as to generate a “liberty\ninterest” protected by the due process clause. (Allen, supra, 482 U.S. at p. 370). Apart\nfrom the shared use of the term “presumption,” we fail to see any connection between\nthose cases and the matters at issue here.\n        This is not to suggest that the “shall/unless” construction is meaningless. The\n“unless” clause clearly constitutes an exception or proviso, and as such should be\nnarrowly construed under general principles of statutory construction. (See Carter v.\nCohen (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1051, quoting Hayter Trucking, Inc. v. Shell\nWestern E & P, Inc. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 [“ ‘Exceptions to the general rule of a\nstatute are to be strictly construed and, in interpreting exceptions to the general statute,\ncourts include only those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the\nexception.’ ”].) However defendant has not couched any argument in terms of the\nconstruction of the proviso, and we do not readily see how such an argument might be\nmade.\n        A more pertinent principle may be that “the party seeking to rely on an exception\nto a general rule has the burden of proving the exception.” (Standard Pacific Corp. v.\nSuperior Court (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 828, 834, italics added; see Simpson Strong-Tie\nCompany, Inc. v. Gore (2010) 49 Cal.4th 12, 25, fn. omitted [referring to the “long-\nstanding rule of construction that the party seeking to benefit from an exception to a\ngeneral statute bears the burden to establish the exception”]; ibid., quoting City of\nLafayette v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1005, 1017 [“ ‘One\nseeking to be excluded from the sweep of the general statute must establish that the\n\n                                              56\n\fexception applies.’ ”].) Here this unquestionably meant that the prosecution bore the\nevidentiary burden of proving that resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger. (Accord, Esparza, supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at pp. 742-743; Kaulick, supra,\n215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\n         The record is somewhat ambiguous with respect to trial court’s allocation of the\nburden of persuasion. At the outset of the hearing the court said to the prosecutor, “Mr.\nCarr, it is your burden, please begin.” This would seem to reflect recognition that it was\nthe prosecutor’s burden to establish that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to the public. However, at the conclusion of the hearing the court expressed its\nfinding in negative terms, stating that it found “nothing right up until the most recent\ntriggering offense to suggest to this Court that the petitioner presents anything but a\nsubstantial risk to public safety if he should be resentenced and released and for those\nreasons I’m going to deny the petition.” (Italics added.) The court’s very reluctance to\nstate as a positive fact that defendant actually posed such a risk casts some doubt on the\nassiduousness with which it applied the burden of proof it had earlier seemed to\nacknowledge. We need not attempt to parse the court’s remarks further, however, for we\nare remanding the matter for further proceedings, in which the burden will rest squarely\nupon the prosecution to establish as a fact that resentencing would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to the public.\n         This conclusion—that respondent bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of\ndangerousness—has the same practical effect as declaring that the statute creates a\nrebuttable evidentiary presumption affecting the burden of proof. (See Evid. Code,\n§§ 605, 115.) And we may also agree that the statute gives rise to a strong appellate\npresumption in favor of a ruling granting a Reform Act petition. Beyond that, however,\nwe are not convinced that the statute gives rise to a presumption in any relevant or useful\nsense.\n\n                                             57\n\f V.    Applicability of Rules of Evidence\n\n       Finally, defendant charges the trial court with error in admitting hearsay evidence,\nincluding his prison disciplinary records and police reports implicating him, via\ncompound hearsay, in the 1981 and 1983 murders and the 1983 arson. He contends that\nthe rules of evidence applicable to trial also apply to hearings held pursuant to\nsection 1170.126(f) to determine whether a petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety. His argument on this point is, again, less than explicit. First he\nmakes a cursory allusion to Evidence Code section 300, which states, “Except as\notherwise provided by statute, this code applies in every action before the Supreme Court\nor a court of appeal or superior court, including proceedings in such actions conducted by\na referee, court commissioner, or similar officer, but does not apply in grand jury\nproceedings.”26 (Evid. Code, § 300 (§ 300); see id., § 105 [“ ‘Action’ includes a civil\naction and a criminal action.”].)\n       On its face this statute would seem to indicate that the codified rules of evidence\napply in every criminal proceeding to which a statute does not expressly declare them\ninapplicable. However, a large body of caselaw has developed which may be very\nbroadly characterized as countenancing the admission of objectionable evidence—i.e.,\nevidence that would be excluded in an ordinary action if properly objected to—in post-\nconviction proceedings such as sentencing and revocation of probation or parole, unless\nthe evidence is so unreliable, or its admission is otherwise so unfair, as to infringe upon\nthe defendant’s due process rights. (E.g., People v. O’Connell (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th\n1062, 1066 [“ ‘As long as hearsay testimony bears a substantial degree of trustworthiness\n\n\n       26\n          Defendant states, “[T]he question of whether a petitioner poses an unreasonable\nrisk to public safety is an inquiry to be conducted separately from a determination of\nwhat the appropriate sentence should be if he is granted relief. [Citation.] Therefore, the\nrules of evidence must apply to the risk assessment hearing. (Evid. Code Section 300.)”\n\n                                             58\n\fit may legitimately be used at a probation revocation proceeding.’ ”].) So far as we can\nsee, none of these cases have considered the effect of section 300. Instead they apply\nconstitutional principles largely developed by the United States Supreme Court. (See,\ne.g., People v. Abrams (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 396, 400, quoting Morrissey v. Brewer\n(1972) 408 U.S. 471, 489 [“the parole revocation ‘process should be flexible enough to\nconsider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be\nadmissible in an adversary criminal trial’ ”]; People v. Lamb (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 664,\n682-683, citing inter alia Williams v. New York (1949) 337 U.S. 241, 251, and Williams v.\nOklahoma (1959) 358 U.S. 576, 584 [“a sentencing court may consider a broad range of\ninformation in deciding whether to grant probation in a particular case. . . . Due process\ndoes not require that a criminal defendant be afforded the same evidentiary protections at\nsentencing proceedings as exist at trial. . . . A sentencing judge may consider responsible\nunsworn or out-of-court statements concerning the convicted person’s life and\ncharacteristics.”]; People v. Winson (1981) 29 Cal.3d 711, 713-714 [in light of federal\nand state authorities concerning due process rights at parole or probation revocation\nhearing, preliminary hearing transcript was improperly admitted without a showing of\ngood cause]; People v. Maki (1985) 39 Cal.3d 707, 713-714, 716-717 [car rental and\nhotel receipts were objectionable hearsay, but reliance on them to prove probationer’s\nabsence from state did not offend due process].)27\n\n\n       27\n          A number of cases have cited People v. Arbuckle (1978) 22 Cal.3d 749, for the\nproposition that relaxed evidentiary standards govern post-conviction proceedings. That\ncase was solely concerned, however, with the defendant’s right to due process and, more\nspecifically, to confront adverse witnesses—specifically the authors of statements in a\ndiagnostic report prepared pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.03. In addressing a\nstatutory argument somewhat similar to the argument that could be made under section\n300, the court noted that section 1203.03 itself brought the report within an exception to\nthe hearsay rule. (Id. at p. 754, fn. 2.) The case therefore does not support the\nproposition that the Evidence Code is inapplicable to post-conviction proceedings.\n\n                                            59\n\f       Of course, constitutional limitations on the admission of evidence are a floor, not a\nceiling. If greater restrictions are imposed by statute, then those restrictions will\nnecessarily govern in the absence of some distinct ground not to give effect to the statute.\n(See People v. Holmes (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1097, italics added [“The rules\ngoverning admission and use of evidence are contained principally in the Evidence Code,\nand the statutes therein govern all criminal proceedings unless overridden by\nconstitutional concerns o[r] specific provisions of the Penal Code.”].) Yet so far as we\ncan tell, the potential effect of section 300—and through it, the rest of the Evidence\nCode—has gone wholly unremarked in these cases.\n       We find, however, that the issue is not ripe for review. We see no indication that\ndefendant ever objected to evidence below on the ground that it violated rules codified in\nthe Evidence Code. Defendant did object to evidence below, but only on the ground that\nit did not meet the constitutional standards previously alluded to. Thus he asserted that\nspecified portions of the prosecutor’s recitation of his history, “and all supporting\nexhibits,” constituted “unreliable hearsay”—a formula pregnant with the concession that\nreliable hearsay would be admissible. (Capitalization altered and italics added.) He\ncompared the challenged evidence to evidence that had been held sufficiently reliable—\nor not—to be considered in sentencing-related proceedings. He quoted the statement in\nPeople v. Eckley (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1072, 1080, that “ ‘a court’s reliance, in its\nsentencing and probation decisions, on factually erroneous sentencing reports or other\nincorrect or unreliable information can constitute a denial of due process.’ ” He asserted\nthat the challenged materials “lack the reliability required for use at a sentencing\nhearing,” and that reliance on them “would be fundamentally unfair” so as to infringe his\n“due process right . . . to insist that only reliable evidence be used in determining whether\nor not he should be resentenced.”\n\n\n\n                                              60\n\f       To preserve objections predicated on the Evidence Code, defendant had to make\nobjections predicated on the Evidence Code. (See Evid. Code, § 353, subd. (a).) We are\nparticularly inclined to enforce this requirement where the objection is of such a character\nthat its timely assertion might have permitted the proponent of the evidence to cure the\ndefect. Here the court was presented with voluminous documentary evidence including\npolice and probation reports, prison records, and transcripts of testimony. The absence of\nspecific objections prevented the prosecution from attempting to cure any objections the\ncourt might otherwise have been inclined to sustain.\n       A similar difficulty attends defendant’s constitutional objections. He objected\nblow to specific sections of the prosecutor’s brief “and all supporting exhibits.” Nor does\nhis brief on appeal target specific items of evidence, stating only that “hearsay like\nMr. Cordova’s prison disciplinary records and prior police investigative reports—linking\nhim to a murder, arson, and rape but resulting in no convictions—should not have been\nadmitted.” But some prison records, and even police reports, may have been admissible\nover a hearsay objection—at least in part—as business or official records. (See Evid.\nCode, §§ 1270-1272, 1280-1284.)\n       We recognize that the task of winnowing objectionable from non-objectionable\nevidence is a daunting one when, as here, the state presents several large volumes of\ndocumentary evidence with nothing resembling an adequate index or other means of\nnavigation.28 The quality of the copies is, for the most part, so poor that the text cannot\n\n\n       28\n          The difficulty is illustrated by defendant’s objection below to section “II.A.” of\nthe prosecutor’s opposition memorandum “and all supporting exhibits.” The cited\nsection recounts defendant’s supposed juvenile history, for which the prosecutor cited\n“Report of Adult Probation Officer, Docket #56487 dated October 18, 1973 (Exhibit 6).”\nPerhaps there was a conspicuous exhibit tab labeled “6” in the trial court record, but on\nappeal the only way to find this document is to thumb through the transcript looking for\nan otherwise blank page bearing that legend.\n\n                                             61\n\fbe digitized and therefore cannot be searched.29 The sheer volume and lack of coherent\norganization of such a presentation may itself raise questions of fundamental fairness.\nTrial by avalanche is bad enough in civil cases between well-heeled litigants. In a\ncriminal case between busy publicly-funded counsel it raises at least a whiff of denial of\ndue process.30 The trial court would act well within its powers in requiring the prosecutor\nto provide a thematic or other index making it possible to frame evidentiary issues in a\nmanageable fashion. At a minimum, the materials should be consecutively page-\nnumbered so that citations to specific documents do not require paging through whole\ntranscripts searching for exhibit numbers, or worse, titles and dates.\n       29\n           This characteristic is exacerbated by the clerk’s apparent practice of reducing\ncopies of file materials by something like 33 percent in copying them for the appellate\ntranscript. The rules of court require the transcript to contain specified documents, not\nminiatures of those documents.\n       30\n           An illustration of the kind of difficulty that arises from such a showing is\nprovided by the prosecutor’s account of a “rape” supposedly occurring on\nJanuary 1, 1973, when defendant was 18. According to the prosecutor’s memorandum,\ndefendant and another youth “grabbed” the 15-year old victim as she was passing a hotel\nand “forced” her into a room where the rape occurred. This was indeed the victim’s\ninitial account, but after it was compromised by further investigation she acknowledged\naccompanying the youths to the room voluntarily. Defendant, the second youth, and a\nthird youth who was apparently not charged all claimed that she had also voluntarily\nconsented to intercourse. She continued to deny this, but defendant was booked and\ncharged only for intercourse with a minor. The disposition of that charge is not reflected\nin the record. But nothing before the trial court reliably established a forcible rape.\n\n       At least two of the items in the prosecutor’s criminal history of defendant rested\nentirely on cryptic entries in a document cited by the prosecutor as a “Manual Criminal\nHistory.” The entries, identical save for arrest and disposition dates about a week apart,\nstate only “ ‘Arrested in prison’ 4573.6 PC / . . . . DA/CA rej, int.just.,” which the\nprosecutor translates as “ ‘Arrested in Prison’ for a violation of Penal Code §4573.6\n(Possession of a Controlled Substance). Case was rejected – Interest of Justice.”\n\n   At least one entry in the history, asserting a parole violation consisting of access to\nammunition and positive tests for controlled substances, is supported by no citations to\nevidence at all.\n\n                                             62\n\f       In any event, our remand will provide ample opportunity to bring evidentiary\nissues into focus, as they are not in the present appeal. Defendant will be free to assert\nany ground of objection, but should target challenged items as precisely as the record\npermits, stating grounds specifically, if he hopes to preserve the issue for further\nappellate review.\n\n                                      DISPOSITION\n\n       The order denying the petition for resentencing is reversed for further proceedings\nin accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\f                                 APPENDIX\n                       PUBLIC DEBATE ON PROPOSITION 47:\n                  SOME WEB SOURCES AVAILABLE AS OF JUNE 2016\n\n1.

Cordova\nH041050\n\n\n\n\n                                   69\n\fH041050 People v. Cordova (Dissent)\n       I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion’s holding that Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” applies to petitions for\nresentencing under Proposition 36. (See People v. Florez, previously published at 245\nCal.App.4th 1176, review granted and opinion superseded June 8, 2016, S234168). None\nof the ballot materials accompanying Proposition 47 mentioned Proposition 36, and there\nis no indication that the electorate intended to modify Proposition 36’s definition of an\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” I would hold that Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” is inapplicable to\nProposition 36, and Proposition 47 contains a drafting error that must be judicially\ncorrected.1\n       Additionally, the majority concludes that defendant’s argument that the rules of\nevidence applies to hearings under Penal Code section 1170.126 (unspecified statutory\nreferences are to the Penal Code) is not ripe for review, because defendant failed to object\nto the introduction of certain evidence below. Here, defendant maintains that the court\nerred in admitting hearsay evidence, including his prison disciplinary records and police\nreports implicating him in the 1981 and 1983 murders and the 1983 arson. I would find\nthat defendant’s argument pertaining to the introduction of hearsay evidence in\nsection 1170.126 hearings is meritless.\n       Defendant’s argument is significantly undermined by section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (g)(2), which expressly authorizes courts to consider petitioners’\n“disciplinary record[s].” A section 1170.126 petition is a postjudgment vehicle by which\ncertain legally convicted and sentenced inmates may benefit from the later enacted Three\nStrikes Reform Act.\n 1\n   Based on this conclusion, I express no opinion regarding the majority opinion’s\nconclusion regarding the retroactivity of the definition. As the majority notes, this issue\nis presently being reviewed by the California Supreme Court.\n\f         Thus, in my view, a section 1170.126, subdivision (f) hearing is more akin to other\nposttrial proceedings—such as parole revocation hearings or sentencing—than it is to\ntrial, where the full protections of the Evidence Code apply. Hearsay evidence is\nadmissible at parole revocation hearings, so long as it “ ‘ “bears a substantial degree of\ntrustworthiness,” ’ ” as determined by the trial court. (In re Miller (2006) 145\nCal.App.4th 1228, 1235.) It is likewise admissible at sentencing proceedings, so long as\nthere is “a substantial basis for believing [it] is reliable.” (People v. Lamb (1999) 76\nCal.App.4th 664, 683 [“Due process does not require that a criminal defendant be\nafforded the same evidentiary protections at sentencing proceedings as exist at trial.”];\nPeople v. Arbuckle (1978) 22 Cal.3d 749, 754 [a sentencing court may consider a broad\nrange of information, including responsible unsworn or out-of-court statements\nconcerning the convicted person’s life and characteristics].) Therefore, hearsay is\nadmissible at section 1170.126, subdivision (f) hearings so long as there is a substantial\nbasis for believing the evidence is reliable.\n         I do, however, agree with the majority opinion’s conclusion that defendant’s equal\nprotection argument has no merit, the dangerousness finding need not be submitted to a\njury and found beyond a reasonable doubt, and there is no presumption in favor of\nresentencing.\n         Lastly, based on my conclusion that the Proposition 47’s definition of “an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” does not apply to petitions for resentencing\nunder Proposition 36, I would find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\nconcluded that defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger if resentenced.\n“Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court,” the abuse\nof discretion standard applies on appeal. (People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060,\n1124.)\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that, on previous grants of\nprobation and parole, defendant has largely shown himself unable to refrain from\nreoffending for any appreciable length of time. Substantial evidence also supports the\ntrial court’s conclusion that many of defendant’s convictions involved weapons, which\nplainly can expose the public to danger. Specifically, the record shows defendant was\nconvicted of attempted armed robbery, armed residential robbery, possession of a firearm\nby a felon (twice), possession of a deadly or dangerous weapon, and possession of a\nconcealed dirk or dagger. The trial court also found that “defendant has numerous\ncriminal convictions that are associated with being under the influence of drugs,” which\nled it to conclude that “addiction and . . . controlled substance abuse has played . . . an\nincredibly significant role in [defendant’s] prior criminal behavior.” In support of its\nfinding regarding defendant’s drug-related criminal convictions, the court erroneously\nmentioned “the 1983 arson in jail,” for which there was no conviction. But, despite that\nmisstatement, substantial evidence nevertheless supports the court’s finding that\ndefendant was convicted of drug-related crimes on numerous occasions. The record\nshows defendant was convicted of driving under the influence three times, possession of\na controlled substance four times, and being under the influence of a controlled substance\ntwice. The court’s conclusion that “addiction and . . . controlled substance abuse has\nplayed . . . an incredibly significant role in [defendant’s] prior criminal behavior” is\nsupported by those convictions, as well as by evidence that defendant admitted to being\nunder the influence of drugs and alcohol during the 1973 armed residential robbery.\n       With respect to defendant’s record of rehabilitation while incarcerated,\nsubstantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that defendant did not participate\nin any self-help programming for a number of years in the late-2000s. (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (g)(2).) The record further supports the trial court’s finding that, during that same\nperiod, defendant did not address his drug addiction. While defendant told Dr. Barron\n\n                                              3\n\fthat he abstained from drug use during those years, as a longtime drug user, there can be\nno doubt he would have benefitted from continued programming to address his addiction.\nThe court also properly considered defendant’s disciplinary record. (Ibid.) The court\ncorrectly noted that defendant had been disciplined numerous times for drug-related\ninfractions in the months leading up to the filing of his petition. Based on the 2004\nincident in which defendant was placed in administrative segregation after prison staff\nwas told defendant threatened another inmate with a shank and defendant’s 2006 fight\nwith three other inmates, the court concluded that defendant demonstrated “potential\naggressive behavior” on two occasions. I agree that the reports of those incidents support\nthe conclusion that defendant was potentially aggressive on both occasions.\n       The court further found, based on the same two events, that defendant has had\n“continued proximity [to] and [an] apparent need to surround himself with weapons.” I\nagree with defendant that substantial evidence does not support that finding. In 2004, no\nshank was found and no disciplinary report was filed. There merely was a confidential\ntip, which does not constitute reasonable, credible, and solid evidence that defendant was\narmed in prison in 2004. (Meyers v. Board of Administration etc. Fund (2014) 224\nCal.App.4th 250, 260 [substantial evidence is evidence of “ ‘ “ ‘ponderable legal\nsignificance’ ” ’ ” that is “ ‘ “ ‘reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value’ ” ’ ”].)\nIn 2006, guards found a razor blade six feet away from where defendant and three other\ninmates had a physical fight. The court suggests that defendant was the one who was\narmed because one of the inmates said a razor blade was pulled on him and the other two\nsaid they did not know how the fight started. In fact, defendant told guards, “I don’t\nknow what happened.” A second inmate said “I don’t even know”; a third said he “just\ngot in a fight”; and a fourth reported that a “dude pulled a blade on me.” Those\nstatements do not constitute substantial evidence that the razor blade belonged to\ndefendant.\n\n                                                4\n\f       Finally, the court considered other relevant evidence as permitted by\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (g)(3). First, the court found defendant was “implicated”\nin murders in 1981 and 1983. Above, I concluded the court was permitted to rely on\nevidence of the murders, even if it constituted hearsay, so long as it was reliable. The\nevidence of defendant’s involvement in the murders included the declaration of an\ninvestigator with the Santa Clara District Attorney’s office, who also was a retired police\nofficer. Because the declaration was made by a law enforcement professional under\npenalty of perjury, I find that it contained sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy due\nprocess. That declaration alone provides substantial evidence to support the court’s\nconclusion that defendant was implicated in two murders. Accordingly, I conclude the\ncourt did not err in relying on evidence of the murders or in reaching that conclusion.\nSecond, the court relied on defendant’s mental health and disciplinary records to find that\ndefendant has not overcome his drug addiction. That finding is supported by substantial\nevidence. Defendant’s prison health records show that he used morphine between 2011\nand January 23, 2014. Despite expressing a desire to stop using the drug in 2012 and\n2013, he achieved only brief periods of sobriety. Defendant underwent treatment for\nmorphine detox between January 24 and January 30, 2014. Because his health records\nafter February 18, 2014, are not in the record, there is no evidence that he has remained\nsober since that time.2\n       In sum, the court’s factual findings are largely supported by substantial evidence.\nThe court did incorrectly refer to the 1983 arson as a conviction in finding that defendant\n 2\n   Defendant told Dr. Barron in April 2014 that he was still not using drugs. However, as\nthe trial court noted, defendant made untrue statements to Dr. Barron. For example, he\ntold Dr. Barron that one DUI was the only crime he committed while under the influence\nof drugs. But the record indicates defendant committed numerous crimes while under the\ninfluence of drugs, including the 1973 armed residential robbery, three DUIs, and two\ninstances of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Therefore, defendant’s\nclaim of being drug-free for four months is not credible.\n\n                                                5\n\fhad been convicted of numerous drug-related crimes. However, because the ultimate\nfinding is supported by substantial evidence, the court’s mistaken belief about the 1983\narson was not “critical to its decision” and thus does not establish an abuse of discretion.\n(People v. Cluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998.)\n       The court also found that defendant was twice armed in prison, which is not\nsupported by substantial evidence. That finding, however, likewise was not critical to the\ncourt’s decision. I acknowledge that the court referred to defendant’s frequent possession\nof weapons, including “firearms” and “cutting instruments,” as its “greatest concern\nperhaps . . . .” But even disregarding the prison incidents, the record shows that\ndefendant was frequently (and illegally) in possession of weapons when he was not in\ncustody between 1973 and 1995.\n       Based on the foregoing, I cannot find that the court abused its discretion in\nconcluding the defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public if\nresentenced. Defendant has a record of nearly continuous criminal behavior when\noutside of prison. Much of his criminal history involves weapons and drug use, both of\nwhich pose a risk of danger to the public, especially when combined. There also is\nevidence that, contrary to defendant’s contention on appeal, defendant has a history of\nphysically harming his victims—namely, the victims of the 1981 and 1983 murders.\nDefendant’s record in prison shows his drug addiction, for which he sought no help\nduring the majority of his lengthy time in prison, remains a problem. His disciplinary\nrecord shows he remains unable to follow the rules or avoid violent confrontations.\n       Accordingly, I would affirm the order denying defendant’s petition for\nresentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                Premo, J.\n\n                                              6\n\fTrial Court:                                 Santa Clara County\n                                             Superior Court No.: 185632\n\n\nTrial Judge:                                 The Honorable Linda R.

Ct. No. 185632)\n\n           v.\n\nJOHNNY MELENDEZ CORDOVA,\n\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n        Defendant Johnny Melendez Cordova is serving a sentence of 25 years to life\nunder the “Three Strikes” law. He petitioned the trial court for resentencing under Penal\nCode section 1170.126 (§ 1170.126), which is part of the Three Strikes Reform Act of\n2012, also known as Proposition 36 (Reform Act). That act entitled him to a reduction in\nhis sentence unless such a reduction would “pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (f) (§ 1170.126(f).) The trial court found this\ncondition to be present and denied his petition on that ground. While this appeal from\nthat ruling was pending, voters adopted the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, also\nknown as Proposition 47 (Safe Neighborhoods Act), which substantially narrowed the\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as that phrase was “used\nthroughout this Code.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.18, subd. (c) (§ 1170.18(c)).) We conclude\nthat the new definition applies, in accordance with its plain terms, to determinations of\ndangerousness under the Reform Act, and that notwithstanding the presumption against\nstatutory retroactivity, it applies to petitions that had already been adjudicated when it\n\fwas adopted. Accordingly, we will reverse with directions to conduct a new hearing on\ndefendant’s petition in which section 1170.18(c)’s definition of dangerousness will\ngovern the determination whether resentencing will pose an unreasonable risk of danger\nto public safety. This disposition renders moot defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency\nof the evidence to sustain the trial court’s ruling under the prior standard. We reject\ndefendant’s contentions that (1) conditioning relief on non-dangerousness violates his\nright to equal protection of the laws; (2) failing to prove dangerousness to a jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt violates his constitutional right to jury trial; and (3) a “strong\npresumption” favors resentencing. We emphasize, however, that the state bears the\nburden of proving that resentencing would create an unreasonable risk of danger as\ndefined in section 1170.18(c).\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Defendant’s Strikes.\n\n       In May 1973, at the age of 19, defendant was charged with a number of felonies\narising from two incidents on successive days. One incident involved a home invasion\nrobbery in which, according to the police report, defendant held a woman and her\nchildren at gunpoint while threatening violence against them. According to a later\ndecision by this court, defendant eventually accumulated four convictions for serious or\nviolent felonies—commonly known as strikes—for purposes of the Three Strikes law,\nPenal Code sections 667 and 1192.7. (People v. Cordova (Nov. 25, 1998, H015896)\n[nonpub. opn.] [at pp. 16-17].)1\n\n\n       1\n         We have granted respondent’s request for judicial notice of the cited opinion as\nwell as an earlier opinion concerning one of the 1973 offenses and a 1982 offense for\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. (People v. Cordova (Dec. 27, 1985,\nA028169) [nonpub. opn.].) According to the District’s Attorneys opposition\nmemorandum below, the latter charge arose when a plainclothes officer saw defendant\n                                              2\n\f       B. Three Strikes Law.\n\n       Two decades after defendant sustained the foregoing convictions, voters and the\nLegislature, respectively, adopted the Three Strikes law.2 (Former Pen. Code, § 667\n[Stats. 1994, ch. 12, § 1]; former Pen. Code, § 1170.12 [Prop. 184, as approved by voters,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994)].) From its enactment until 2012, it provided that a defendant\nwith a prior strike who was convicted of any subsequent felony would receive what came\nto be known as a “second strike” sentence, i.e., imprisonment for “twice the term\notherwise provided as punishment.” (Pen. Code, § 667, subd. (e)(1), as adopted by Stats.\n1994, ch. 12, § 1; id., § 1170.12, subd. (c)(1), as adopted by Prop 184.) One with two\nstrikes who suffered a subsequent felony conviction would receive a “third strike”\nsentence of 25 years to life. (Former Pen. Code, §§ 667, subds. (e)(1), (e)(2)(A)(ii), as\nadopted by Stats. 1994, ch. 12, § 1]; former Pen. Code, § 1170.12, subds. (c)(1),\n(c)(2)(A)(ii), as adopted by Prop 184.)\n\n       C. Defendant’s Third-Strike Conviction.\n\n       In December 1995 defendant was arrested on a charge of carrying a concealed dirk\nor dagger, a violation of former Penal Code section 12020, subdivision (a). (See now\nPen. Code, § 21310.) In July 1996 a jury found him guilty of that offense. The offense\nwas (and still is) a “wobbler,” i.e., it could be prosecuted either as a misdemeanor or a\nfelony; if punished as a felony, it would ordinarily carry a maximum penalty of three\nyears’ imprisonment. (Former Pen. Code, § 12020, subd. (a), as adopted by Stats.1994,\nch. 23, § 4, p. 132; former Pen. Code, § 18, as adopted by Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, § 98,\n\n\nfiring a hunting rifle at a shooting range. Defendant told the officer that “he had recently\npurchased the weapon for $1,100 and . . . was planning on hunting . . . in Idaho.”\n       2\n        We refer to the law in the singular while recognizing that it was adopted in two\nversions—which do not, however, vary materially for present purposes.\n\n                                             3\n\fp. 5089; see now Pen. Code, §§ 21310, 1170, subd. (h).) As a third-striker, however,\ndefendant was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life.3 This court affirmed the\nconviction and sentence. (People v. Cordova, supra, H015896 [p. 17].)\n\n       D. Reform Act.\n\n       Defendant was serving the above sentence on November 6, 2012, when voters\nadopted the Reform Act. It has two chief components: “the first part is prospective only,\nreducing the sentence to be imposed in future three strike cases where the third strike is\nnot a serious or violent felony (Pen. Code, §§ 667, 1170.12); the second part is\nretrospective, providing similar, but not identical, relief for prisoners already serving\nthird strike sentences in cases where the third strike was not a serious or violent felony\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126).” (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1292 (Kaulick).) More specifically, the prospective provisions make new non-\nstrike felonies generally punishable by a maximum sentence of double the base term—a\nformer second-strike sentence—regardless of the number of strike priors. (Pen. Code,\n§§ 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C), 667, subd. (e)(2)(C).) The retrospective provision, section\n1170.126(f), entitles third-strikers who would be eligible for reduced sentencing if their\nconvictions were new to petition for recall of sentence.\n       Section 1170.26(f) directs that a petitioner who satisfies the criteria for eligibility\n“shall be resentenced” as a second-striker “unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” In exercising the discretion thus granted, the court may consider: “(1) The\n       3\n          The probation officer recommended a sentence of 31 years to life, consisting of\nthe third-strike life sentence plus six one-year enhancements for prior convictions. (See\nPen. Code, § 667.5, subd. (b).) According to our decision in that case, the trial court\nstayed the enhancements. The correct procedure was to strike them, but nothing has been\nmade of the trial court’s failure to do so. (See People v. Langston (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2597428\"><a href=\"/opinion/2597428/people-v-langston/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1241.) The trial court also denied a motion to strike any of the “strike” priors.\n\n                                               4\n\fpetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the\nextent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of\nthe crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\nincarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to\nbe relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).) However, the act contains no definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” a phrase which, at the time of its adoption,\nappeared nowhere else in the Penal Code.4\n\n       E. Petition and Appeal.\n\n       On August 22, 2013, defendant filed a petition for resentencing under\nsection 1170.126(f). The court found that he satisfied the criteria for eligibility—a point\nthe state does not contest—and appointed counsel to represent him. A clinical\npsychologist conducted a mental health examination and found no evidence that\ndefendant, then 60 years old, would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety if released. However, the prosecutor presented over 950 pages of records\nreflecting an extensive history of criminal conduct beginning at the age of 13. These\nmaterials alluded to a number of uncharged crimes involving incipient or actual violence,\nincluding two homicides in which defendant was reportedly implicated.5 In all, between\n\n       4\n           The operative language may have been borrowed from cases reviewing\ndecisions by the Board of Parole Hearings to deny parole to a life prisoner on the ground\nthat, as stated in the governing regulation, “the prisoner will pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to society if released from prison.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 2402, subd. (a).)\nCases have often couched such findings in terms of “an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety.” (E.g., Board of Prison Terms v. Superior Court (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In January 1997,\n                                             5\n\f1973 and 1995, defendant was convicted of 17 misdemeanors and 12 felonies. The\nprosecutor also cited an extensive disciplinary history in prison, although the only\nincidents that appeared to involve violence were (1) a reported threat by defendant in\n2004 against an inmate he reportedly believed was a child molester—an incident\nattributed by both inmates to a misunderstanding; (2) a four-inmate fight in 2006, the\norigins of which officers were unable to establish, but in which one of the inmates was\napparently armed with a razor blade6; and (3) a beating of defendant in 2006 by a\ncellmate for unknown reasons. Evidence was also adduced of in-prison employment,\nwith favorable reports by a supervisor, as well as participation in various rehabilitative\nand educational programs. The evidence showed a history of drug use up to a few\nmonths before the hearing on the petition.7\n\n\n\n\nand again in August 2002, prison authorities “validated” defendant as a “drop-out” of the\ngang. At the hearing below, the prosecutor argued that his dropout status increased\ndefendant’s dangerousness by making him a “marked man” who was “going to have to\nengage in defending himself at any given time which . . . given his history, will . . . force\nhim to regain and utilize weapons.” Of course if defendant had not dropped out of the\ngang, his membership would undoubtedly have been cited—far more plausibly—as\nevidence of continuing dangerousness. Catch 22 is no part of our Penal Code.\n       6\n          The trial court’s remarks suggest that it found that defendant must have been the\npossessor of the blade because the record contains self-exculpatory statements by the\nother three participants. One of the participants reportedly said, “I had to, the dude pulled\na blade on me.” However we see nothing in the record identifying “the dude,” and of\ncourse to draw any inference from any of the participants’ statements requires the\nsupposition, for which no evidence appears, that the speaker was speaking truthfully. We\nfind nothing in the records of this incident that could reasonably be characterized as\nreliable evidence that defendant was its author. (See pt. V, post.)\n       7\n         Defense counsel argued below that the 2006 assault had inflicted painful injuries\nwhich prison medical authorities treated with opiates, thus triggering the addiction, or\nrelapse, which preceded the hearing.\n\n                                              6\n\f       The trial court denied the petition on May 19, 2014, finding “nothing right up until\nthe most recent triggering offense to suggest to this Court that the petitioner presents\nanything but a substantial risk to public safety.” Defendant took this timely appeal.\n\n       F. Proposition 47.\n\n       While the appeal was pending, on November 4, 2014, the electorate enacted the\nSafe Neighborhoods Act. It reclassified certain drug and theft related felonies as\nmisdemeanors and, mirroring the Reform Act, provided for recall of sentences already\nbeing served for the reclassified offenses. The resentencing provision, Penal Code\nsection 1170.18 (§ 1170.18), echoes section 1170.126 in directing that the petitioner\n“shall be . . . resentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Id., subd. (b) (§ 1170.18(b).) But it goes on, as the Reform Act had not, to define this\nphrase: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’\nmeans an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the\nmeaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667.” (§ 1170.18(c), italics added.) The cross-referenced section sets forth a\nlimited list of “violent felony” offenses, sometimes known as “super strikes.” (See\nCouzens, et al., Prop47FAQs.pdf (November 2015), <http://www.courts.ca.gov/\ndocuments/Prop47FAQs.pdf> (as of Jun. 20, 2016).) The effect of the new definition is\nto require resentencing unless the court finds an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will\ncommit a super strike. The question here is whether defendant may avail himself of this\nnarrowed definition. Basic principles of statutory construction compel the conclusion\nthat he can.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f I.    Applicability of Section 1170.18(c)\n\n       A. Introduction.\n\n       The central question is whether section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety” applies to that phrase as used in section 1170.126(f).8 On\nthe face of the two statutes the question seems to answer itself: Section 1170.18(c)\ndeclares the definition applicable “throughout this Code.” “This Code” can only mean\nthe Penal Code. Section 1170.126 is part of the Penal Code. Quod est demonstrandum:\nthe definition applies to petitions under section 1170.126, i.e., Proposition 36.\n       It is of course the most fundamental of all principles of statutory construction that\nthe role of the court in applying any statute is to carry out the intent manifested therein.\n(See Code Civ. Proc., § 1858 [“In the construction of a statute or instrument, the office of\nthe Judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained\ntherein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted”]; County\nof Santa Clara v.

(See fn. 8,\nante.) The four arguments are: (1) section 1170.18(c) applies by its terms only to\npersons seeking resentencing under the Safe Neighborhood Act’s retroactive provisions;\n(2) the effect of section 1170.18(c) on Reform Act petitions was not mentioned in the\nballot pamphlet and thus cannot have been intended by voters; (3) the “timing” of the\nSafe Neighborhood Act makes an intent to alter the Reform Act “illogical”; and\n(4) applying the new definition to Proposition 36 petitions contravenes the declaration in\nProposition 47 that “[n]othing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or\nabrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act”\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (n)). These arguments do not, singly or in combination, override the\nplain language of section 1170.18(c).\n\n       B. Use of “Petitioner.”\n\n       We find somewhat bewildering the argument that section 1170.18(c) applies by its\nterms only to petitioners under the Neighborhoods Act. This conclusion is said to flow\nfrom “the plain language of Proposition 47,” in that the definition refers to “the\npetitioner,” which according to respondent can only mean a petitioner under\nsection 1170.18. The statute thus “substantively limit[s]” the definition to Proposition 47\npetitions.\n       This argument cannot withstand scrutiny. If anything, the use of “petitioner” is\nfurther evidence (see pt. I(C), I(F), post) that the drafters had Proposition 36 applicants—\nwho are also “petitioner[s]”— in mind when they adopted a new and narrower definition\nfor a phrase used in that earlier measure. Given the explicit directive to apply this\n\n\n                                             9\n\fdefinition “throughout this Code,” respondent’s argument could at best give rise to an\ninternal ambiguity or contradiction which would have to be resolved in favor of the latter\nphrase as the more definite and concrete expression of legislative intent. But this would\nassume that some clear textual basis could be found for respondent’s reading. The\ndirective that the definition apply “throughout this Code” actually appears in the statute,\nwhile the language imputed by respondent does not. There is thus no ambiguity or\nconflict to resolve. By unmistakable directive, the definition is to apply wherever the\ndefined phrase appears. As it happens, the defined phrase appears in only one other\nplace—the Reform Act—where it is relevant to determine a “petitioner’s” right to relief.\nIt is therefore applicable by its plain terms to this proceeding.\n\n       C. Voter Understanding.\n\n           1. No Presumption of Voter Ignorance.\n\n       The no-longer citable decision quoted by respondent states its chief rationale as\nfollows: “[B]ecause Proposition 47’s ballot materials and proposed statutory language\ncontained nothing whatsoever to suggest that Proposition 47 would have any impact on\nthe resentencing of anyone who was serving a sentence for a crime other than one of the\nspecified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes, it is inconceivable that voters\nintended for subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 to severely restrict the ability of a court to\nreject a resentencing petition under the Reform Act by a person convicted of crimes other\nthan one of the specified property or drug crimes and whom the court considered\ndangerous. The Proposition 47 ballot materials contained no mention of such a possible\nconsequence . . . .” (First and fourth italics added.)\n       This passage exemplifies two rhetorical devices generally employed to obscure\nrather than illuminate the truth. The first known as “honor by association,” in which a\nfalse statement is coupled to a true one in hopes that the latter’s luster will attach to the\nformer in the mind of the listener. It appears here in the coupling of the phrase “and\n                                              10\n\fproposed statutory language” with “ballot materials.” It is true that the ballot materials\ncontain no reference to the measure’s effect on Proposition 36 petitions. But it is patently\nfalse that the statutory language contained “nothing whatsoever to suggest that\nProposition 47 would have any impact” on persons serving sentences for crimes other\nthan those for which Proposition 47 reduced the penalty. By its plain terms, the statute\nwould apply “throughout this Code,” which would include anywhere else the defined\nphrase was used. The attempt to grant substance to a contrary premise by coupling it to a\ntrue statement says more about the insecurity of the speaker’s position than it does about\nthe merits of the controversy.\n       A more serious defect is reflected in the quoted passage’s use of an argumentum\nad ignorantiam, or argument from ignorance, in which the absence of evidence for a\npremise is asserted as proof of the opposite premise. Such an argument is doubly\noffensive when, as here, there is evidence of the disputed premise, i.e., the plain statutory\nlanguage, which is indeed the best, most reliable, and safest evidence of the point at\nissue. The argument’s implicit major premise is that in the absence of affirmative\nextrinsic evidence to the contrary, voters can be presumed not to have understood the\neffects of the measures they adopt, however unmistakably those effects may flow from\nthe language adopted. The court’s reluctance to enunciate this premise—let alone defend\nit—is entirely understandable, since it contravenes fundamental principles of statutory\nconstruction as well as any concept of judicial restraint and, not surprisingly, nearly a\ncentury of precedent.\n       The correct rule is that voters “must be assumed to have voted intelligently upon\nan amendment to their organic law, the whole text of which was supplied each of them\nprior to the election, and which they must be assumed to have duly considered, regardless\nof any insufficient recitals in the instructions to voters or the arguments pro and con of its\nadvocates or opponents accompanying the text of the proposed measure.” (Wright v.\n\n                                             11\n\fJordan (1923) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3305541\"><a href=\"/opinion/3305883/wright-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713.) This principle has been reaffirmed through the years:\n“Petitioners’ entire argument that, in approving Proposition 8, the voters must have been\nmisled or confused is based upon the improbable assumption that the people did not\nknow what they were doing. It is equally arguable that, faced with startling crime\nstatistics and frustrated by the perceived inability of the criminal justice system to protect\nthem, the people knew exactly what they were doing. In any event, we should not lightly\npresume that the voters did not know what they were about in approving Proposition 8.\nRather, in accordance with our tradition, ‘we ordinarily should assume that the voters\nwho approved a constitutional amendment “. . . have voted intelligently upon an\namendment to their organic law, the whole text of which was supplied each of them prior\nto the election and which they must be assumed to have duly considered.” ’ ”9\n(Brosnahan v.

(10th ed. 2014), p. 1274, col. 2.) However no basis readily\nappears to apply a different rule to purely statutory measures, and indeed the measure at\nissue in Brosnahan included both constitutional and statutory amendments. (See\nBrosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at pp. 242-245.)\n\n                                              12\n\fReform Act loudly proclaimed in the ballot pamphlet. (Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov.\n6, 2012) text of Prop. 36, p. 52.) We must assume that in enacting the Safe\nNeighborhoods Act, with its modification of the grounds on which such relief could be\ndenied—a modification explicitly declared applicable throughout the code—voters\n“knew exactly what they were doing.” (Brosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 252.)\n       A presumption of voter incomprehension is all the more repugnant when the\nmeasure at issue was “extensively publicized and debated.” (Amador Valley, supra, 22\nCal.3d at p. 243.) In Brosnahan, the court rejected a contention that the measure at issue\ncould be denied effect on the ground that its “complexity . . . may have led to confusion\nor deception among voters, who were assertedly uninformed regarding the contents of the\nmeasure.” (Brosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 251.) In addition to the information in the\nballot pamphlet, the court observed, voters had been exposed to “widespread publicity”\nconcerning the measure: “Newspaper, radio and television editorials focused on its\nprovisions, and extensive public debate involving candidates, letters to the editor, etc.,\ndescribed the pros and cons of the measure.” (Id. at p. 252.) As demonstrated below, the\nsame is true of Proposition 47, at least to the extent of newspaper editorials, opinion\npieces, and web pages debating its merits.10 Further, Proposition 47 was far less complex\nthan the measure under scrutiny in Brosnahan, as to which the court rejected the\nsuggestion that complexity alone could vitiate the voters’ objectively manifested will:\n“ ‘Our society being complex, the rules governing it whether adopted by legislation or\ninitiative will necessarily be complex. Unless we are to repudiate or cripple use of the\ninitiative, risk of confusion must be borne.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Fair Political Practices\nCom. v.

That should end the inquiry. This result is mandated\nnot only by the most basic principles of statutory construction, but also by the\nconstitutional separation of powers. In enacting a ballot measure the voters are\nexercising a legislative power no less worthy of respect than that of their representatives\nin Sacramento. (Cal. Const., art. IV, § 1; see Brosnahan, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 241,\n\n                                             14\n\fquoting Amador Valley, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 248 [“it is our solemn duty jealously to\nguard the sovereign people’s initiative power, ‘it being one of the most precious rights of\nour democratic process’ ”].).) To nullify statutory language because voters’ attention was\nnot specifically drawn to it in the ballot pamphlet strikes at the heart of the initiative\npower and, more fundamentally, at the sovereign dignity of the legislative branch. Due\nregard for that dignity requires that when legislative will is expressed in clear language\nwhose effects are not absurd and do not frustrate other positive manifestations of\nlegislative intent, lawmakers—here, voters—must be deemed to have intended the effect\nof their enactments, whatever courts may believe about their subjective expectation,\nunderstanding, or level of insight.\n       This principle, which should be too obvious to need saying, is reflected in\ncountless decisions. For example, in In re Gabriel G. (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251289\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251289/in-re-gabriel-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citation.] The only evidence of inadvertence the Department\noffers is its assessment of the unintended consequences the change will have. Legislation\noften has unintended consequences. But we cannot construe the amendment in a manner\nwholly unsupported by its text merely to avoid the purported unintended consequences.\n[Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 1436-1437, italics added.)\n       The tacit premise of respondent’s argument is that the literal effect of\nsection 1170.18(c) on Reform Act petitions is an unintended consequence which courts\ncan and should avert by refusing effect to the plain statutory language. But a\nconsequence cannot be deemed unintended when the most reliable evidence of intent—\nthe language lawmakers adopted as the objective manifestation of their will—clearly and\n\n                                              15\n\funambiguously directs it. “Courts may, of course, disregard even plain language which\nleads to absurd results or contravenes clear evidence of a contrary legislative intent.”\n(Ornelas v.

Since there\nis no evidence that voters intended not to produce the effect in question, courts have no\nlegitimate alternative but to give effect to the statute as it is written.\n\n\n           2. Ballot Pamphlet as Sole Evidence of Voter Understanding.\n\n       If further inquiry into voter intentions were warranted, there would be no sound\nreason to confine it to the contents of the ballot pamphlet, which are constrained by\nconsiderations of space, time, and subjective determinations of materiality. The official\nsummary of any ballot measure is authored by the office of the Legislative Analyst.\n(Elec. Code, §§ 9087, 9086, subd. (b).) The summary is required only to “generally set\nforth in an impartial manner the information the average voter needs to adequately\nunderstand the measure.” (Elec. Code, § 9087, subd. (b), italics added.) Note the\nabsence of any directive that the Legislative Analyst attempt to provide voters with a\ncomplete understanding of the measure, which would be a practical impossibility in any\nevent; few judges or lawyers would be so arrogant as to profess that they completely\nunderstand any provision of law, at least in the sense of being able to forecast all of its\neffects. (See In re Gabriel G., supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1437 [“Legislation often has\nunintended consequences.”].) In manifest recognition of this fact, the governing statute\nstates only that the ballot summary “may contain” such “background information” as “the\neffect of the measure on existing law.” (Elec. Code, § 9087, subd. (b), italics added.)\nThe Legislative Analyst is thus called upon only to make a rational judgment about what\neffects are most likely to matter to voters, and to describe them in a fair and intelligible\n\n\n                                               16\n\fway. Inherent in this undertaking is the necessity of informational triage—of\ndetermining what details are necessary to form an “adequate[] understanding[ing],” and\nwhat details may be omitted. The preparer of such a summary necessarily exercises a\ndiscretionary function requiring courts to allow considerable latitude when the result is\nchallenged as incomplete or inaccurate. (See Brennan v. Board of Supervisors (1981)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2113798\"><a href=\"/opinion/2113798/brennan-v-board-of-supervisors/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 [“Faced with the difficult task of simplifying a complex proposal,\nthe Committee drafted a summary which, if not all-encompassing, at least briefly\ndescribed its major subjects.”].)\n       When the Legislative Analyst fails to mention some effect of a ballot measure, it\nremains open to the measure’s official proponents and opponents to use their space in the\nballot pamphlet to supply any perceived lack. But they too must practice triage; their\narguments are restricted to 500 words to open and 250 words in rebuttal. (See Elec.\nCode, §§ 9062, 9069, cf. id., § 9041.)11 This means the advocates must select a limited\n\n\n       11\n          There seem to be a number of lacunae in the statutes governing ballot\narguments. The cited sections appear in Article 6 of Chapter 1 of Division of the\nElections Code, which is entitled “Arguments Concerning Measures Submitted to\nVoters,” and which seems to address only situations where no supporting or opposing\nargument has otherwise been submitted. There are two references to a “time limit” for\nsubmission of arguments by other members of the public (Elec. Code, §§ 9062, subd. (c),\n9064), but we find no other statute or regulation prescribing such a limit. A chapter\nseemingly addressed to non-initiative measures includes a requirement that supporting\nand opposition arguments be “submitted to the Secretary of State” by a date “to be\ndesignated” by that officer. (Elec. Code, § 9043.) Another statute provides that if\narguments are not submitted by legislators, they may be submitted by interested voters\n“by a date sufficient to meet ballot printing deadlines.” (Elec. Code, § 9044.) The\nSecretary of State is required to begin publicizing the printed pamphlet at least 45 days\nbefore the election. (Elec. Code, § 9094, subd. (b).) The materials constituting the ballot\nmust be delivered to the state printing office “at least 40 days prior to the date for\nrequired delivery to the elections officials as provided in Section 9094.” (Elec. Code,\n§ 9082.) And the proposed contents must be made available for public inspection at least\n20 days before delivery to the printer. (Elec. Code, §§ 9092, 88006.) This suggests that\narguments must be submitted to the Secretary of State at least 105 days before the\n                                            17\n\fnumber of points to include in their ballot pamphlet arguments, relying on other media to\npursue issues deemed of lesser moment. Here, both sides evidently concluded that the\neffect of section 1170.18(c) on Proposition 36 petitions was not a powerful enough\nground of argument to warrant mention in the pamphlet. That decision can hardly furnish\nan occasion for judicial nullification.\n\n\n           3. Public Debate.\n\n       As already noted and as reflected in the Appendix, Proposition 47 aroused a great\ndeal of public debate. Much of it was devoted to various aspects of the measure’s\nprospective reclassification of specified offenses to misdemeanors. But opponents of the\nmeasure also sought to publicize its narrowed definition of dangerousness and the effect\nthat definition would have on other proceedings, specifically including petitions for\nresentencing under the Reform Act. Thus one opposition Web site, as archived 36 days\nbefore the election placed this effect at the top of a list of reasons to vote against the\nmeasure: “Prop 47 will release dangerous Three Strikes inmates. Prop 47 goes far\nbeyond petty crimes. It rewrites our laws to make it easier for violent Three Strikes\nfelons to gain early release. [¶] The Three Strikes reform law (Proposition 36) allowed\ncertain Three Strikes prisoners to petition for early release, as long as they did not pose\n‘an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.’ [¶] Prop 47 would rewrite California\nlaw, including the Three Strikes Reform law, to give the term ‘unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety’ a very narrow definition. [¶] Under the Prop 47 definition, only\nan inmate likely to commit murder, rape, or a handful of other rare crimes like possession\nof a weapon of mass destruction can be kept behind bars as a danger to public safety. [¶]\nIf Prop 47 passes, violent Three Strikes inmates who might commit robbery, assault with\n\nelection. However we have found no indication of any deadline that officer may actually\nhave set with respect to the November 2014 election.\n\n                                              18\n\fa deadly weapon, felony child abuse, arson, kidnapping, spousal abuse, child abduction,\ncarjacking, and scores of other serious felonies will no longer be defined as ‘dangerous’\nunder California law.

Penal Code §1170.126 requires that when a\npetitioner meets the basic criteria for eligibility, the court shall resentence the offender\nunless the petitioner poses ‘an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.’ . . .\nAlthough this is a demanding standard, it provides a fair balance and allows the\nprosecution and court to rely on several sources and areas of risk to establish that the\nindividual is unsuitable for resentencing. [¶] Penal Code § 1170.18 . . . changes that\nstandard to an altogether unreachable level. [It] . . . would require the prosecution to\nprove, and the court to find, that the defendant is an unreasonable risk to society because\nhe would likely commit one of the listed violent crimes in § 667(e)(2)(C)(iv).\n[¶] . . . [¶] Further, this proposed new definition of ‘dangerousness’ is not limited to only\nthe types of offenders serving terms for crimes affected by this Act, but applies to any\nresentencing permitted by the Penal Code. Proposed Penal Code § 1170.18(c) states, ‘As\nused throughout this Code, “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety[”] means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof [§ 667(e)(2)(C)(iv)].’ (§ 1170.18, subd. c [emphasis added].) By referring to ‘Code,’\n§ 1170.18 would alter the meaning of ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,’ not\nonly as it is applied in § 1170.18 resentencing hearings, but in all other hearings that\nrely on the dangerousness standard throughout the entire Code. As a result, the\nprosecution would face the impossible barrier when opposing resentencing for the Three\nStrikes defendants under Penal Code § 1170.126. [¶] Moreover, for [sic] any of the\nThree Strikes defendants previously denied resentencing based upon a judicial finding of\ndangerousness, may appeal that ruling and request the court now apply this new\nstandard of dangerousness, resulting in a further cost to a court system already struggling\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\ffinancially.” (CALIFORNIANS AGAINST PROP. 47 | About Proposition 47 (archived\nOct. 10, 2014) <https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/\nhttp://californiansagainst47.com/about-proposition-47/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016), italics\nadded; see Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf, <http://www.co.mendocino.ca.us/da/pdf/\nProposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf> (as of Jun 20, 2016) [apparent copy of CDAA\nreport]; Proposition 47: A Cruel Fraud <http://docplayer.net/1464582-Proposition-47-a-\ncruel-fraud.html> (as of Jun. 20, 2016) [same].)\n       Nor did these arguments appear only on opponents’ Web sites.

CAP47 created a website in opposition to the measure, including the\npage described above, which sets forth what it describes as an “extensive evaluation of\nProposition 47 from the [CDAA].” (Californians Against Prop. 47 | About Proposition\n47 (archived Oct. 5, 2014) <https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/\nhttp://californiansagainst47.com/about-proposition-47/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016.)\n       It thus appears that one opposition author was president of an organization that\nwrote and circulated a paper specifically attacking Proposition 47 for its effect on Reform\nAct petitions—including those that had already been adjudicated. Another opponent was\npresident of an organization that contributed to an entity whose Web site highlighted that\n\n\nwould cut penalties for 1 in 5 criminals in California - LA Times (Oct. 11, 2014)\n<http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141012-\nstory.html> (as of Jun 20, 2016 [opponents “have reported raising $288,000 for the No\ncampaign, most of it earmarked to go to companies that send out campaign mail”].) As\njust noted, for example, highly relevant articles appeared in online versions of the\nRedland Daily Facts, the Highland Community News, and the Victorville Daily Press.\nWhile it seems likely that these articles also appeared in the print editions of those\npublications, we have no way of testing that supposition.\n\n                                            23\n\feffect as a reason to vote no. Their failure to cite this effect in the ballot pamphlet\nsupports an inference, not that the effect was too obscure to be noticed, but that\nopponents did not think it a powerful enough argument for inclusion in the limited space\navailable to them. This in turn suggests that by invalidating the plainly expressed will of\nthe voters, we would be handing opponents of the measure a victory they could not, and\nknew they could not, win at the ballot box.\n       In any event, given this public opposition to the measure on the very grounds at\nissue here, it simply cannot be said that voters were unaware of the challenged effect\nwhen they adopted Proposition 47. The reality of course is that some voters were aware\nof it and some were not. It is no proper role of the courts to guess at these numbers or to\nimpose thresholds of voter comprehension which must be met to our satisfaction before\nwe will carry out the terms of voter-enacted legislation. We are constrained by the\nseparation of powers to trust not only the ballot pamphlet, but arguments in the public\nmarketplace of ideas, to ensure that adopted measures reflect the actual will of the voters.\nIn the absence of absurdity, constitutional infirmity, or frustration of an affirmatively\nmanifested purpose, a voter-adopted statute must be given effect according to its plain\nmeaning.\n\n       D. “Illogical Timing.”\n\n       The no-longer-citable decision incorporated in respondent’s brief asserts that\nProposition 47’s “timing” made it “illogical” to suppose that section 1170.81(c) would\napply to Reform Act petitions: “ ‘The Reform Act required petitions to be brought within\ntwo years unless a court concluded that there was good cause for a late-filed petition.\n([Pen. Code,] § 1170.126, subd. (b).) By the time Proposition 47 took effect, only two\ndays remained in the two-year period for filing a Reform Act petition. No rational voter\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fcould have intended to change the rules for Reform Act petitions at the last moment,\nwhen nearly all petitions would already have been filed and most of them adjudicated.”\n       We find this argument badly flawed at multiple levels. In the first place, courts\ncannot deny effect to plain statutory language merely because they find it “illogical” in\nsome unexplained way. The most nearly apposite rule, noted above, is that plain\nlanguage may be overlooked when its literal application would produce absurd results.\n(California Highway Patrol v. Superior Court (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2244860\"><a href=\"/opinion/2244860/california-highway-patrol-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The underlying rationale is\nthat the Legislature cannot have intended to bring about an absurdity, so if a literal\napplication has that effect, the statute must fail to accurately express the Legislature’s\ntrue intent.

Indeed, we see nothing illogical about\nit. Where we do find patent illogic is in the tacit, unexplained assumption—contrary to\nthe opinions of the measure’s opponents, as described above—that the newly adopted\ndefinition of dangerousness could only apply in cases not yet filed or, at most, not yet\nadjudicated. The quoted decision acknowledged, only to ignore, the flexible deadline for\n\n                                              25\n\fProposition 36 petitions, i.e., “within two years after the effective date of the act that\nadded this section or at a later date upon a showing of good cause.” (Pen. Code,\n§ 1170.126, subd. (b), italics added.) We think it highly likely that the adoption of a new\nstandard governing dangerousness determinations, if otherwise applicable to a petition,\nwould be held to provide “good cause” for its later presentation. But the question is\nalmost certainly academic because it is probably true that, as the quoted decision\nacknowledged, nearly all Proposition 36 petitions would already have been filed when\nProposition 47 took effect.14 The two-year limitation could have no impact on those\npetitions because they had been filed within the allotted time. All or nearly all of those\npetitions were probably on appeal when Proposition 47 took effect. The question before\nvoters, then, was not whether any Proposition 36 petitions remained unadjudicated but\nwhether the benefits of the new definition should extend to petitions that had already\nbeen adjudicated. We discuss that question in part I(F), post.\n\n       E. Finality of Judgments.\n\n       Respondent also adopts a passage from the above-mentioned uncitable decision in\nwhich the court concludes that literal application of section 1170.18(c) is barred by\nanother subdivision of the same section declaring that “[n]othing in this and related\nsections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not\nfalling within the purview of this act.” (Pen. Code, § 1170.18, subd. (n)\n\n\n       14\n          Of course, the court’s implicit admission that a few petitions might remain\nunfiled or unadjudicated is also fatal to its reasoning. A statute cannot be denied effect\non the ground that a court finds the number of beneficiaries too small to justify relief.\nThere is nothing “illogical” about extending a remedy to less than the entire universe of\npersons to whom it might have been extended. Nor is there anything “practical” about\nrefusing effect to a provision that, by its plain terms, has such an effect. That there are\ntoo few life rafts means some may drown, not that all must do so. A contrary conclusion\nwould require a far more substantial explanation than appears in the quoted decision.\n\n                                              26\n\f(§ 1170.18(n)).)15 The first flaw in this reasoning is that insofar as section 1170.18(c)\napplies to petitions brought under the Reform Act, those petitions are within the statute’s\n“purview,” i.e., its “limit, purpose, or scope.” (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dict. (10th\ned. 1999) p. 950.) Second, the application of section 1170.18(c) to Reform Act petitions\ndoes not “diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments” in those cases. If defendant’s\npetition here is ultimately granted, whether or not section 1170.18(c) plays a material role\nin that outcome, it will be the Reform Act itself that has “diminish[ed] or abrogate[d] the\nfinality” of his conviction by requiring that he be resentenced unless found to present an\nunreasonable danger. Proposition 47 now supplies the test to be applied in determining\nthe latter issue, but it is not Proposition 47 that impairs the finality of his original\nconviction. That is the Reform Act’s doing. The petitioner in such a case is not invoking\nProposition 47 as a basis to reopen or attack the judgment, but as the source for the rule\nof decision governing a subsidiary issue, in accordance with Proposition 47’s plain terms.\nComplying with that mandate does not “diminish or abrogate” the original judgment,\neven if it proves dispositive of the petition. It is still the Reform Act, not Proposition 47,\nthat impairs the finality of his sentence.\n       Had the drafters and voters intended to achieve the result urged by respondent,\nthey could have simply replaced “throughout this Code” with “in this act” in\nsection 1170.18(c). We must give effect to all of the language chosen by the voters,\nincluding the directive that section 1170.18(c)’s definition of dangerousness govern\ndeterminations of that issue in Proposition 36 proceedings.\n       15\n           The quoted passage states, “ ‘Applying section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition throughout the Penal Code would necessarily ‘diminish or abrogate the finality\nof judgments’ in cases, like those subject to the Reform Act, that do not fall ‘within the\npurview of’ Proposition 47. Defendant’s petition under the Reform Act, like most such\npetitions, seeks to abrogate the finality of a Three Strikes judgment in a case that does not\ninvolve one of the . . . crimes [specified in Proposition 47]. Thus, under section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (n), ‘[n]othing’ in section 1170.18 was intended to apply to his petition.’ ”\n\n                                               27\n\f       We conclude that section 1170.18(c) applies to Reform Act petitions by its terms\nand that no meritorious ground has been cited for departing from the plain meaning of\nthose terms. This brings us to the question whether application of that provision to this\nparticular case would offend the presumption against giving retroactive effect to statutory\nprovisions.\n\n       F. Retroactive Effect.\n\n          1. Effect of Estrada and Brown.\n       In his opening brief defendant anticipated an objection based on the presumption\nagainst retroactivity, as follows: “The general rule is that a new statute which lessens\npunishment will be applied to a non-final judgment. (In re Estrada (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n748 (Estrada).) The exception to the rule is that a statute will not be given retroactive\neffect when it contains a savings clause. (Id.) In this instance, there is no savings clause\nin section 1170.18 with respect to the operation of the new definition of ‘unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety.’ ”\n\n       Respondent counters that the absence of an express retroactivity clause renders\nsection 1170.18(c) unavailable to persons in defendant’s position, and that Estrada was\ninapplicable in light of its interpretation in People v. Brown (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324-\n325 (Brown).\n       The briefs thus echo a number of cases which have addressed the question of\nretroactivity as if it were a matter of choosing between Estrada and Brown.\nWe find this framing of the issue inadequate. In Estrada, while the defendant was\nawaiting sentencing for an escape from custody, the underlying statute was amended to\nreduce the minimum sentence and eliminate a restriction on parole eligibility. The court\nheld that he was entitled to the benefit of the amendment: “When the Legislature amends\na statute so as to lessen the punishment it has obviously expressly determined that its\nformer penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for\n\n                                             28\n\fthe commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature\nmust have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now deemed to\nbe sufficient should apply to every case to which it constitutionally could apply. The\namendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts\ncommitted before its passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is\nnot final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to conclude that\nthe Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a conclusion not permitted in\nview of modern theories of penology.” (Estrada, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 745.)\n       For some time, Estrada was understood to create a presumption, counter to a more\ngeneral presumption against statutory retroactivity, that a penal statute reducing criminal\npenalties would operate in favor of all defendants whose convictions were not yet final.\n(See 1 Witkin & Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (4th ed. 2012) Introduction to Crimes, § 49,\npp. 89-90.) However, Brown placed an important limitation on this counter-presumption.\n(Brown, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) The defendant there sought to take advantage of a\nliberalized formula for calculation of conduct credits for confinement in local custody.\nFinding no indication that the Legislature intended to grant credits retroactively, the court\nheld that the statute operated to increase credits only for time in custody after its effective\ndate. The defendant argued, among other things, that a contrary conclusion was\nwarranted by Estrada. The court limited Estrada’s counter-presumption to cases where a\nstatute “mitigat[es] the punishment for a particular criminal offense.” (Id. at p. 324,\nitalics added.)\n       Assuming this limitation operates here to make Estrada inapplicable, it means\nonly that Estrada’s presumption in favor of retroactive application does not aid\ndefendant. It does not follow that the statute does not operate retroactively. As the\nBrown court acknowledged at the outset of its analysis, “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative\n\n                                               29\n\fintent.” (Brown, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 319; see People v. Nasalga (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1441562\"><a href=\"/opinion/1441562/people-v-nasalga/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 792 [“To ascertain whether a statute should be applied retroactively, legislative\nintent is the ‘paramount’ consideration.”]; Evangelatos v.

It thus remains to determine whether the\npresumption against retroactive effect applies here or whether the presumption is\novercome by evidence of legislative intent to the contrary. Estrada’s counter-\npresumption need not, and does not, enter into our analysis.\n       We have concluded that section 1170.18(c) must be held available to defendant\nand others in his position for at least seven partly interlocking reasons: (1) the language\nand structure of section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c), strongly indicate that they were\ndeliberately aimed at Proposition 36 petitions, with the intention of reducing the number\nof denials of relief in those cases; (2) such a purpose implies a legislative finding that the\nprior regime was unduly restrictive, resulting in the denial of relief where relief should\nhave been granted; (3) failing to apply the statute to cases such as this one would largely\nor entirely thwart the intent thus manifested, because all or nearly all petitions that could\nhave been brought under Proposition 36 would have already been heard when the new\ndefinition took effect; (4) to the extent the statute might still reach a few unadjudicated\npetitions, it would be absurd to reward them for delayed filing while punishing prisoners\nwho acted speedily to seek relief under Proposition 36; (5) the overarching purposes of\nboth Proposition 36 and Proposition 47 support the conclusion that the latter’s\nmodification of the former was intended to operate retroactively; (6) retroactive effect\nwould also ensure that Proposition 36 achieved the cost savings it was intended to yield;\n\n                                              30\n\fand (7) the statute was ameliorative or curative in intent, i.e., it was designed to remedy\nan undesirable consequence of prior law, and this characteristic also favors retroactive\napplication;\n            2. Presumption Against Retroactivity.\n\n       It is a longstanding presumption in Anglo-American law that statutes operate only\nprospectively unless a contrary intent clearly appears. (See U.S. v. Heth (1806) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">399</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413 (opn. of Paterson, J.) [“Words in a statute ought not to have a retrospective\noperation, unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative, that no other meaning can be\nannexed to them, or unless the intention of the legislature cannot be otherwise\nsatisfied.”].) California law as pronounced by our Supreme Court seems to diverge from\nthe common-law presumption in a number of respects. However that is the law by which\nwe are bound, and which we shall undertake to apply.\n       California courts have pronounced a number of competing and even conflicting\nrules for determining whether applying a statute to a given case contravenes the\npresumption. We extract from these cases the principle that a statute will be denied effect\nin a given case if (1) the effect would be “ ‘retroactive’ ” for purposes of the\npresumption; and (2) an intent to bring about such an effect is not clearly manifested in\nthe statute.

We note, however, that this proposition is not\nreadily harmonized with the presumption’s rationale. (See Sekt v. Justice’s Court of San\nRafael Tp. (1945) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1168895\"><a href=\"/opinion/1168895/sekt-v-justices-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 [“Where the reason for the rule ceases the rule\nshould not apply.”]; Civ.

The common-law presumption is\ngenerally understood to rest on the same principle as the constitutional prohibitions\nagainst ex post facto laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts: there is a great\nrisk of unfairness in applying a new law so as to diminish rights or enlarge obligations\nthat arose prior to the enactment of the law.

Such a rule would imbue “extrinsic sources” with a greater dignity than the text\nitself. To illustrate its unsoundness one need only posit a measure awarding cash grants\nto the victims of a natural disaster, but failing to declare itself retroactive. Such a statute\nmust clearly operate retroactively, at least in the same sense and to the same extent as the\nstatute now before us; otherwise it cannot operate at all. To require “extrinsic sources” to\nthis effect would be absurd. What is apparently meant by the quoted language is that\nextrinsic sources alone cannot justify retroactive operation unless they do so very plainly.\n       17\n           The leading treatise on statutory construction likewise notes that the common-\nlaw presumption rests on a perception that “retroactive application of new laws is usually\nunfair.” (2 Singer et al., Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction (7th ed. 2009)\n(Sutherland), § 41:2, p. 386, fn. omitted, italics added.) It describes the scope of the\npresumption as depending on “under what circumstances, for what purposes, with what\neffects, and to what extent, unfairness results from the time frame within which a\n                                              32\n\fthe presumption has often been described as arising only when a statute impairs rights or\nenlarges liabilities that arose under prior law.

(See Sutherland, supra, § 41:2, p. 389, fn.\nomitted [“It is not unfair for a law retroactively to confer benefits . . . unless it arbitrarily\ndeprives some people of the benefits.”].) Nonetheless California cases, particularly in the\ncriminal context, have repeatedly applied a presumption against statutory retroactivity\nwithout regard to whether it impaired anyone’s rights, enlarged anyone’s liabilities, or\notherwise inflicted any appreciable harm on anyone, unfairly or otherwise. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Harmon (1960) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2604996\"><a href=\"/opinion/2604996/people-v-harmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25-26 [presumption barred defendant from\ninvoking later reduction in punishment for offense of which he was convicted]; Estrada,\n\n\nretroactive statute exerts its influence.

We nonetheless find the presumption rebutted by clear\nevidence that section 1170.18(c) was intended to apply to cases such as defendant’s.\n            3. Statutory Text.\n\n       We find in the text of section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c), several clear\nmanifestations of an intention to reach petitions for resentencing not only under\nProposition 47 but also under the Reform Act. The most obvious of these is the\ndeclaration that the new test of dangerousness is to apply “throughout this Code.”\n(§ 1170.18(c).) The defined phrase (“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety”)\nappears at only one other location in the Penal Code: section 1170.126(f), which governs\npetitions for resentencing under the Reform Act. The enunciation of a definition to apply\n“throughout this Code” can only have been intended to reach those proceedings.\n       This conclusion is reinforced by further examination of the relevant language. It\nwill be recalled that as adopted, the Reform Act required resentencing unless the court\ndetermined that it would pose “an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(§ 1170.126(f).) This language was understood to vest trial courts with “broad discretion\n\n       18\n          To be sure, our Supreme Court has sometimes used language echoing the\nnarrower conception of what effects will trigger the presumption against retroactivity.\n(See Californians For Disability Rights v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1074-1075 [rejecting vagueness challenge].)\n       The drafters of Proposition 47 manifestly concluded that a narrower test was\nneeded. They thus mandated resentencing unless the court found “an unreasonable risk\nthat the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (§ 1170.18(c),\nitalics added.) But if their intent was only to make this the test governing Proposition 47\npetitions, they could have simply incorporated it directly into section 1170.18(b). Instead\nthey first borrowed the exact phrase used in Proposition 36, and then redefined that\nphrase to give it a new meaning (§ 1170.18(c).) There was no reason to incorporate the\nearlier phrase if the intent was only to grant narrower discretion under Proposition 47\nthan courts were exercising under the Reform Act. Such a regime would require only\nthat section 1170.18(b) mandate resentencing unless the court found an unreasonable risk\nthat the petitioner would commit a violent felony. In other words, the old phrase could\nsimply have been replaced by the new one. This was the most obvious way to draft the\nstatute—assuming an intent to apply only to Proposition 47 cases—and it would have had\nat least three virtues: simplifying section 1170.18 by eliminating any need for a separate\ndefinition, shortening it by omitting subdivision (c), and obviating any confusion over the\napplicability of the new test to Reform Act petitioners. That the drafters instead lifted the\noperative language from the Reform Act and then redefined it in a substantially narrower\nway is an indication that their very purpose was to alter the rule in Reform Act\nproceedings so as to constrain the discretion courts had been exercising in those cases,\nand to correct the resulting denials of relief.\n       “[I]n reviewing the text of a statute, [courts] must follow the fundamental rule of\nstatutory construction that requires [that] every part of a statute be presumed to have\nsome effect and not be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary. ‘Significance\n\n                                               35\n\fshould be given, if possible, to every word of an act. [Citation.] Conversely, a\nconstruction that renders a word surplusage should be avoided. [Citations.]’\n[Citations.]” (People v. Arias (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2636300\"><a href=\"/opinion/2636300/people-v-arias/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180.) Here, the construction\nadvocated by respondent would render not merely a word, but an entire phrase\nsuperfluous. If Proposition 47 does not alter the standard applicable in Proposition 36\ncases, the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” performs no useful\nfunction in Proposition 47; its only effect is to needlessly complicate and lengthen the\nstatute. By understanding that phrase as directly aimed at Proposition 36 proceedings, we\ngive it the only meaning and effect it can have. We conclude that its very purpose is to\ncorrect an unduly parsimonious judicial treatment of Proposition 36 petitions. As will\nappear, that intent compels the conclusion that it was also intended to govern petitions\nthat had already been filed and denied in the trial court.\n          4. Overarching Retroactive Intent.\n\n       The resentencing provisions in both Proposition 36 and Proposition 47 were\nexplicitly retrospective in intent. Both measures pointedly relieved current prisoners of\npenalties duly imposed on them under prior law. (See People v. Scarbrough, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 926-927 [“section 1170.18 codifies the voters’ intent to retroactively\nreduce properly imposed punishment for certain criminal offenders”].) Each reflected a\njudgment by the electorate that the prison population included inmates who should not be\nthere, or should not long remain, because they had been imprisoned for life on nonviolent\noffenses (Proposition 36) or because they were imprisoned for “petty” offenses\n(Proposition 47). The proponents of Proposition 36 argued, and voters impliedly found,\nthat these remissions of sentence were necessary to “MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT\nTHE CRIME” and thereby conserve “[p]recious financial and law enforcement\nresources” that were being “improperly diverted to impose life sentences for some non-\nviolent offenses.” (Ballott Pamp., Gen. ELec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of Prop. 36, at p. 52.)\n\n                                             36\n\fThis point was repeated in the rebuttal to the opponents’ argument, along with the\nstatement, “People convicted of shoplifting a pair of socks, stealing bread or baby\nformula don’t deserve life sentences.” (Id. at p. 53, italics added.) The same intent is\nexpressed, more frequently if somewhat less directly, in the arguments supporting\nProposition 47, i.e., it would “[s]top[] wasting prison space on petty crimes and focus[]\nlaw enforcement resources on violent and serious crime by changing low level nonviolent\ncrimes such as simple drug possession and petty theft from felonies to misdemeanors.”\n(Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47 at p. 38, italics added; see ibid.,\nitalics added [“Stops wasting money on warehousing people in prisons for nonviolent\npetty crimes”; id. at p. 39 [rebuttal: “Stops wasting prison space on petty crimes”].)\n(Italics added.)\n       In enacting these two initiatives, voters clearly intended to grant retroactive relief.\nThat is the very gist and essence of the resentencing provisions. We see no coherent\nreason to suppose that this same intent did not inform the decision to adopt, in\nProposition 47, a narrowed test of dangerousness applicable by its terms to Proposition\n36 petitions. We find it inconceivable that voters, having twice decided to extend new\nrights retroactively to current inmates, intended to limit those rights depending upon the\nprocedural happenstance of when a petition was heard in the trial court. (See Falcon v.\nState (Fla.2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 962 [noting the “patent unfairness of depriving\nindistinguishable juvenile offenders of their liberty for the rest of their lives, based solely\non when their cases were decided”].)\n           5. Fiscal Effects.\n\n       An intent to apply the new test retroactively is also suggested by the fiscal\npurposes of the two measures. The Legislative Analyst estimated that Proposition 47\ncould realize annual savings “in the low hundreds of millions of dollars” (Ballott Pamp.,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Promp. at p. 37), beginning with “the resentencing of\n\n                                              37\n\finmates currently in state prison,” which “could result in the release of several thousand\ninmates, temporarily reducing the state prison population” (id. at p. 36). Likewise,\nProposition 36 was intended to realize savings estimated at up to $90 million per year by\nshortening future sentences and resentencing current inmates pursuant to\nsection 1170.126. (Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. Nov. 6, 2012) text of Prop. 36 at p. 50\n[Analysis by Legislative Analyst].) Critically, the Legislative Analyst noted that this\nnumber “could be tens of millions of dollars higher or lower depending on several\nfactors,” first among them “the number of third strikers resentenced by the court and the\nrate at which [the Board of Parole Hearings] would have released third strikers in the\nfuture under current law.” (Ibid.) The Legislative Analyst thus recognized—and\ninformed voters—that the rate of denials of Proposition 36 petitions would directly affect\nthe savings actually achieved.\n       As of 2010, a nonprofit institute estimated the annual cost of imprisonment in\nCalifornia at nearly $50,000. (The Price of Prisons | California Fact Sheet.pdf,\n<http://www.vera.org/files/price-of-prisons-california-fact-sheet.pdf> (as of\nJun. 9, 2016).)19 This translates into a cost of one million dollars for every 20 inmate-\nyears. Denial of a Proposition 36 petition means—and was understood by voters to\nmean—that taxpayers would continue to accrue this expense until an inmate died, barring\nearlier release by the Board of Parole Hearings. To that extent every denial impaired the\n\n       19\n          By 2014, some widely circulated estimates were placing the annual cost of\nimprisonment at $60,000 or higher per inmate. (See, e.g., Fewer State Prisoners, Higher\nCost Per Inmate - California Budget & Policy Center (Aug. 7, 2013)\n<http://calbudgetcenter.org/blog/fewer-state-prisoners-higher-cost-per-inmate/> (as of\nJun. 20, 2016 [“California is expected to spend about $60,000 for each inmate in 2013-\n14”]; McKinney, et al., In Response: Proposition 47 adds up |\nSanDiegoUnionTribune.com (Sept. 12, 2014)\n<http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/sep/12/in-response-proposition-47-\nadds-up/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016) [“California spends $62,300 to house one inmate\nannually”].)\n\n                                             38\n\ffiscal purpose of both initiatives, i.e., to save money by reducing the prison population.\nGiven the implied finding in Proposition 47 that the earlier measure had granted courts\ntoo much latitude—resulting in the denial of too many petitions—it is entirely rational to\nsuppose that voters intended to relieve themselves of the ongoing costs of those rulings\nby requiring their reexamination under the new, more restrictive standard.\n       Here, defendant had apparently served 17 or 18 years of his 25-to-life sentence\nwhen he petitioned for resentencing. The denial of his petition meant that he would\nspend at least another seven years in prison, at a taxpayer cost of some $350,000. If he\nwere not eventually released by the Board of Parole Hearings, he could easily survive\nanother 20 years, representing a cost upwards of $1 million. Given that this\nimprisonment followed application of a dangerousness test voters had found too broad, it\nis entirely likely that they meant for him to be released unless he were shown to satisfy\nthe new, more rigorous test. Since nothing approaching such a showing is suggested by\nthis record, there is every reason to believe that voters intended the new test to apply to\nhis and similar cases.20\n\n       20\n            Some of the opposition materials alluded to the cost of rehearing Reform Act\npetitions as a reason to vote against Proposition 47. (See CALIFORNIANS AGAINST\nPROP. 47 | About Proposition 47 (archived Oct. 10, 2014)\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/http://californiansagainst47.com/about-\nproposition-47/>, (as of Jun. 20, 2016), italics added; see California District Attorneys\nAssociation, A Look at Proposition47.pdf\n<http://www.co.mendocino.ca.us/da/pdf/Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf> (as of\nJun. 9, 2016); Proposition 47: A Cruel Fraud <http://docplayer.net/1464582-Proposition-\n47-a-cruel-fraud.html> (as of Jun. 20, 2016.) At least one uncitable decision has also\ncited this cost as a reason not to infer an intent by the voters to apply section 1170.18(c)\nretroactively. It does not require an advanced degree in mathematics to discern that the\ncosts of such proceedings pale by comparison to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that\nwill be borne by taxpayers when a petition is denied. The legislative analyst estimated\nthat resentencing proceedings under Proposition 36 could generate costs of “a few million\ndollars . . . over a couple of years.” (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of\nProper 36 at p. 50.) Apparently, some 3,000 prisoners were potentially eligible for\nresentencing; this at any rate is what opponents told voters. (Id. at p. 52, quoting Fresno\n                                             39\n\f           6. Futility of Prospective-Only Application.\n\n       Once it is recognized that Proposition 36 petitioners were intended beneficiaries of\nsection 1170.18(c)’s new definition of dangerousness, it becomes apparent that it must\noperate retroactively or it will have virtually no effect. In this light, the considerations\ncited in the “timing” argument discussed in part I(D), ante, operate in favor of applying\nthe new definition to cases in which a Proposition 36 petition has already been denied.\nThe factual premise of that argument are the two-year deadline for Reform Act petitions\nhad all but expired when Proposition 47 took effect. It therefore stands to reason that\nnearly all eligible inmates would already have filed a Reform Act petition when the new\ndefinition took effect. Indeed most, if not nearly all, would already have been ruled\nupon. This follows not only from the deadline but from simple self-interest. Inmates had\nno apparent reason to delay and every reason to act quickly. Every day an inmate waited\ncould be a needless day of “base durance.” (Henry IV, Part II, act. V, sc. v.) Therefore,\ninsofar as the new definition was intended to apply to Proposition 36 petitions, it must\neither reach petitions that had already been denied in the trial court, or it was doomed to\nhave virtually no effect.\n       Akin to the constructional presumption against superfluous language is a\npresumption that lawmakers do not adopt pointless legislation. (See Barrett v. Dawson\n(1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258026\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258026/barrett-v-dawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1054 [“We will not presume the Legislature engaged in a\nfutile act”].) If section 1170.18(c) does not apply to this case, and others like it, it will\napply to few if any Proposition 36 cases. It follows that voters intended the new\n\nBee [“ ‘If Proposition 36 passes, about 3,000 convicted felons serving life terms under\nThree Strikes could petition for a reduced sentence’ ”]; see ‘3 strikes’: Proposed law tries\nto restore intent – SFGate (Nov. 28, 2012) <http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/3-\nstrikes-Proposed-law-tries-to-restore-intent-2296566.php> (as of Jun. 9, 2016.) This\nsuggests an estimated cost per resentencing hearing in the low four figures. Such an\nexpenditure must be deemed negligible as against an annual expense of at least $50,000\nfor continued imprisonment.\n\n                                               40\n\fdefinition to apply to as many Proposition 36 petitions as possible, which certainly\nincludes any in which an order of denial was not yet final.21\n          7. Perversity of Prospective-Only Application.\n       In answer to the foregoing reasoning it might be suggested that a handful of\nProposition 36 petitions remained unfiled or unadjudicated when Proposition 47 took\neffect, and that section 1170.18(c) was intended to apply only to them. In this view the\nextension of the new definition to Proposition 36 cases was not wholly futile, but only\nmostly futile. Accepting the factual proposition that some petitions remained unheard,\nthe posited intent—to benefit only this small class of petitioners—seems irrational to the\npoint of absurdity or even perversity. By this logic, voters intended to extend the newly\nrestrictive definition of dangerousness to those petitioners who waited until near (or\nbeyond) the end of the two-year limitations period, but to withhold it from those\nprisoners who filed promptly and whose petitions, as a result, had already been denied\nwhen Proposition 47 took effect.\n       Ordinarily the law rewards diligence. (See Civ. Code, § 3527.) The foregoing\nreading would impute to voters an intention to, in effect, punish those who had acted with\nalacrity in seeking the relief voters offered them in Proposition 36. That is, the only\npetitioners likely to glean the benefit of the new enactment would be those—if there were\nany—who had waited to file their petitions until the time to do so had very nearly expired\n(or, on a showing of good cause, beyond that time). This would not only seem to\n\n       21\n          This case presents no occasion to express an opinion on what remedies might\nbe available to those whose petitions were denied on dangerousness grounds and as to\nwhom that ruling has become final. It is at least arguable that section 1170.18(c)\nprovides relief in those cases; certainly the opponents expected it to do so. (See\nCALIFORNIANS AGAINST PROP. 47 | About Proposition 47 (archived Oct. 10, 2014)\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054701/http://californiansagainst47.com/about-\nproposition-47/> (as of Jun. 20, 2016); see Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf\n<http://www.co.mendocino.ca.us/da/pdf/Proposition47_A_Cruel_Fraud.pdf> (as of\nJun 20, 2016); Proposition 47: A Cruel Fraud <http://docplayer.net/1464582-Proposition-\n47-a-cruel-fraud.html> (as of Jun. 20, 2016.) The question is not presented here,\nhowever, and we do not address it.\n\n                                             41\n\fdiscriminate irrationally against the diligent and in favor of the dilatory; it would also fly\nin the face of the avowed cost-saving purpose of these measures by rewarding those who\nhad, by their delay in seeking relief, diminished the savings taxpayers would realize from\na reduction in their sentences.\n       As we have already noted, in applying a statute courts seek to “ ‘avoid a\nconstruction that would produce absurd consequences, which we presume the Legislature\ndid not intend.’ ” (In re Greg F. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406; People v.

Applying a more restrictive standard of dangerousness to\npetitioners who were relatively dilatory in seeking relief, while relegating others to\nadditional years of confinement at public expense even though the same standard might\nhave required their release as well, can readily be characterized as an absurd result which\ncounsels in favor of construing the statute literally to the benefit of defendant and all\nothers similarly situated.\n          8. Remedial/Ameliorative Purpose.\n\n       The leading treatise on statutory construction identifies “three circumstances\nwhere retroactive application of a statute may be justified: (1) where legislative intent\nexpressly or impliedly indicates retroactive application is desirable; (2) where the statute\nis ameliorative or curative in nature; or (3) where fulfillment of the parties' reasonable\nexpectations may require the statute’s retroactive application.” (2 Sutherland, supra, §\n41:4, p. 423, fn. omitted.) We have already concluded that the first circumstance is\npresent. The same appears true of the second, i.e., that section 1170.18(c)’s modification\nof the dangerousness standard was adopted to ameliorate, cure, or remedy a perceived\ndefect in the standard adopted in Proposition 36. The very fact that voters sharply limited\nthe kind of dangerousness that would justify denial of resentencing implies dissatisfaction\nwith the manner in which courts had exercised the broad discretion granted them by the\noriginal test as adopted in Proposition 36. Voters impliedly found that courts had\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\fwrongly denied some number of Proposition 36 petitions by too readily finding that the\npetitioners presented an unreasonable risk of danger.22\n       To be sure, “a remedial purpose does not necessarily indicate an intent to apply the\nstatute retroactively.” (Evangelatos v. Superior Court, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1213.) It\nwill, however, contribute to an inference of such intent consistent with the more general\nprinciple that such statutes are “entitled to liberal construction in order to achieve full\nfruition of their remedial purposes.” (2 Sutherland, supra, § 41:11, at p. 506, fn. omitted;\nsee Hellinger v.

The trial court apparently found that defendant posed an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety based on (1) his undoubtedly violent conduct\nas a young gang member nearly four decades ago; (2) his involvement in violent\nincidents in prison for which he was not, on this record, shown to be responsible; and\n(3) evidence of ongoing or recurring issues with substance dependency. Obviously,\nevery third strike prisoner had to incur two or more serious or violent felonies—strikes—\nto be eligible for a third-strike sentence. It is therefore likely that many if not most\nProposition 36 petitioners would have had violent pasts. And while recent aggressive\nconduct in prison would certainly support an inference of current dangerousness, merely\nsuffering violence at the hands of others—which is consistent with the evidence\npresented here—would not. Finally, while chemical dependency may warrant concerns\nabout some sort of criminal conduct, many would question whether, by itself it points to\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n\n                                              43\n\fBaird v.

Equal Protection.\n\n       Defendant contends that the scheme enacted by Proposition 36 violates the Equal\nProtection Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions because it reduces the\npunishment for yet-to-be-sentenced defendants regardless of dangerousness, while\nextending relief to current inmates only if their resentencing is not found to pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger. According to defendant, equal protection requires the\napplication of the same standard for defendants seeking resentencing and defendants\ncurrently being sentenced.\n       Equal protection issues arise when it appears that a statute treats similarly situated\npeople differently. If this occurs, and the disparate treatment “creates a suspect\nclassification or impinges on the exercise of a fundamental right,” it is subject to strict\nscrutiny, meaning that it will be upheld “only if it is necessary to further a compelling\nstate interest.” (People v. Silva (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296299\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296299/people-v-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In other cases, the\ndisparity “will satisfy constitutional requirements if it bears a rational relationship to a\nlegitimate state purpose.” (Ibid.)\n       The first question posed by an equal protection claim is whether the defendant has\nbeen subjected to disparate treatment vis à vis another class of persons that is “ ‘similarly\nsituated for purposes of the law challenged.’ ” (Cooley v. Superior Court (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253, quoting People v.

Defendant notes that new third-strike offenders and persons currently\n\n\n                                              44\n\fserving third-strike sentences share a common criminal history: “Members of both\ngroups have at least two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies as well as a\ncurrent non-serious, nonviolent offense that would have previously subjected them to a\nThree Strike sentence of 25 years to life.” This makes them “similarly situated” for\npurposes of the Reform Act, he contends, because the goals of that act were “to ‘restore\nthe Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life sentences\nonly when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime’ and to ‘save\nhundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars every year’ by ensuring that the state does not\ncontinue to indefinitely house people serving life sentences for ‘minor crimes.’ ”\n(Quoting Ballott Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) Findings and Declarations,\nProposition 36, § 1; at p. 105.) These goals, he asserts, were the same with respect to\nboth past and future offenders.\n       This oversimplifies the rationale of the Reform Act as well as that of the Three\nStrikes law it was intended to reform. The basic premise of the Three Strikes Act was\nthat any person who committed a third felony after being convicted or two or more strike\nfelonies deserved a life sentence. The Reform Act reflects the judgment that a two-strike\nhistory coupled with a non-violent current offense does not necessarily reflect either\nenough culpability or enough dangerousness to justify a life sentence, particularly given\nthe fiscal burdens such a sentence imposes upon the state and its taxpayers. The Reform\nAct reflects a balancing of these three factors—culpability, dangerousness, and cost—in a\nmanner calculated to suitably punish the defendant and adequately protect society while\neasing the financial burdens flowing from the earlier, more vindictive approach.\n       We may assume that current third-strike inmates and new third-strike offenders\nare chargeable with the same level of culpability. However we do not believe they are\nsimilarly situated with respect to the other two factors. Perhaps the least of the\ndifferences—though still very real—is the cost savings to be realized from applying the\n\n                                             45\n\fReform Act to current inmates, as compared to the savings that can be realized with new\noffenders. Defendant, as previously noted, has already served much of his sentence. He\nwill become eligible for parole in a few years. Most of the costs of his sentence are, in all\nprobability, water under the bridge. Were a new offender being currently sentenced on\nan identical record, however, the reduction in his sentence—and resulting savings—\nwould be dramatic: the potential sentence would be reduced from a 25 year minimum to\na 12 year maximum.23 Under the figures previously mentioned, the resulting costs would\nbe reduced from (at least) $1,250,000 to (at most) $600,000. (See pt. I(F)(5), ante.)\n       More significant, however, are the differences between the two groups in the\nstate’s ability to address perceived dangerousness on the part of the offender. An\nappreciation of this point must begin with a review of the role of dangerousness, as\nperceived by the prosecutor and sentencing judge, in determining the punishment to be\nvisited upon a criminal defendant. In commencing a prosecution the prosecutor exercises\nthe prerogative of deciding what to charge and how to charge it. This power is exercised,\npresumably, in light of two primary factors: perceived culpability and dangerousness.\nThe same considerations inform any decision the prosecutor may make with respect to a\nproffered guilty plea to less than all of the charges brought. When the matter comes up\nfor sentencing, the power shifts to the trial court to make discretionary decisions affecting\nthe extent of the defendant’s punishment, perhaps most notably the choice of a base term\n(lower, middle, or upper) and whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences.\nAgain these decisions are likely to be infused with judgments about both culpability and\ndangerousness.\n\n\n\n       23\n          The 12 years would consist of double the three-year maximum base term, plus\nthe six one-year priors which the sentencing court stayed, although they should instead\nhave been stricken. (See People v. Langston (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2597428\"><a href=\"/opinion/2597428/people-v-langston/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1241.)\n\n                                             46\n\f       It follows that whenever a sentence is retroactively reduced by blanket legislation\nsuch as the Reform Act, one result may be to nullify at least some prosecutorial and\njudicial decisions that were intended, at least in part, to protect the public from a\nparticular defendant’s perceived dangerousness. To the extent the perceptions of\ndangerousness were sound—and remain sound when the sentence is reduced—the\nnullification of those actions may expose the public to an unreasonable risk of danger. It\nis these risks which drafters sought to avert by empowering the trial court to deny\nresentencing under the Reform Act upon a finding that the defendant in fact presents an\nunreasonable risk of danger to the public.\n       This circumstance distinguishes current inmates from new offenders. In the case\nof the latter, the prosecutor, followed by the sentencing court, will often still have the\npower to shape a punishment deemed sufficient to address any perceived dangerousness.\nThe Reform Act merely eliminates one tool they possessed under prior law—the power\nto impose a 25-to-life sentence for a non-strike felony.24 The prosecutor may still seek\nconviction of additional or more serious charges or enhancements, and the court can still\nmake sentencing choices, designed to protect the public from the defendant’s perceived\ndangerousness for relatively longer periods. This is a protection that the public does not\nhave under a categorical, across-the-board reduction in sentences already imposed.\n       A similar point is hinted at, though not in the immediate context of an equal\nprotection claim, in People v. Yearwood (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Yearwood). The\ndefendant there had been sentenced about a year before the adoption of the Reform Act,\n\n\n       24\n           This of course assumes that the facts would not sustain a charge asserting a\nqualifying strike. It is entirely possible that under the prior regime, a prosecutor might\nforego efforts to convict a third-striker of a serious or violent felony—perhaps as part of a\nplea arrangement—because some lesser offense could still yield a 25-to-life sentence.\nShould such a case arise in the wake of the Reform Act, the prosecutor may avoid the\neffects of that act by seeking and obtaining a conviction of the serious or violent felony.\n\n                                              47\n\fbut the conviction was not final when that act took effect. He contended that he was\nentitled to be sentenced as a new offender under the act, without being required to invoke\nthe resentencing provisions. In rejecting this contention as a matter of statutory\nconstruction, the court wrote, “Giving amended [Penal Code] sections 667 and 1170.12\nprospective-only application supports the Act’s public safety purpose by reducing the\nlikelihood that prisoners who are currently dangerous will be released from prison due to\nthe Act. During the pretrial, trial and sentencing phases of the criminal justice system,\nvarious discretionary decisions are available to the prosecutor and the trial court that\ncan result in a shorter or longer term of imprisonment (e.g., selection of the appropriate\nbase term, concurrent/consecutive sentencing, dismissal of a strike in the interests of\njustice). Once the defendant is sentenced, prosecutorial and judicial discretion are\neffectively exhausted.” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 176, italics added.) In other words, to\ntreat the defendant as a new offender after he had been sentenced under prior law would\ndeprive the prosecutor and court of the powers they would otherwise have to craft an\noutcome reflecting their sense of the defendant’s dangerousness. The same is true of\ncurrent inmates who invoke the resentencing provisions of the Reform Act. This places\nthem in a materially different position than new offenders, and warrants a treatment of\ntheir cases that takes the question of dangerousness into account.\n       We conclude that defendant has not demonstrated the threshold requirement for an\nequal protection challenge, i.e., that he be situated similarly to the newly charged\ndefendants to whom he compares himself.\n\nIII.   Jury Trial\n\n       Defendant contends that the prosecution was required to prove dangerousness to a\njury beyond a reasonable doubt under the authority of Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (Apprendi), which held that the federal constitutional rights to a jury\n\n\n                                             48\n\fand to proof beyond a reasonable doubt (U. S. Const. 6th & 14th Amends., § 1) extend to\nthe trial of “any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\nmaximum.” (See People v. Towne (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 [referring to requirement that\n“a fact exposing a defendant to a higher sentence be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable\ndoubt”].) Defendant contends that since he is eligible for resentencing under the Reform\nAct, the “prescribed statutory maximum” for his offense is now the second-strike\nsentence of double the base term that would be imposed if resentencing were granted. An\nunreasonable risk of danger thus constitutes, he contends, a fact “increas[ing] the\npenalty” to a 25-to-life term. Accordingly, he concludes, that fact must be tried by a jury\nand found, if at all, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       This court has already held that the rule of Apprendi does not apply to a\ndetermination of dangerousness under a Reform Act petition. (Esparza, supra, 242\nCal.App.4th at pages 737-740.) Defendant fails to persuade us that we should reconsider\nthat holding. In Apprendi the question was whether a finding of racially biased\nmotivation, the effect of which was to double the maximum sentence to which the\ndefendant was exposed, could be properly made by a judge rather than a jury. The state\nargued that it was not an element of the offense but a “sentencing factor” which, under\nSupreme Court precedent, need not be found by a jury. (Apprendi, supra, 530 U.S. at\np. 492; see McMillan v. Pennsylvania (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86, 90 (McMillan).) The\nSupreme Court had signaled its rejection of this distinction in a federal prosecution where\nit held that “under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and\njury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that\nincreases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted\nto a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Jones v. United States (1999) 526 U.\nS. 227, 243, fn. 6.) In Apprendi it reaffirmed this rule, insofar as it involved jury trial and\nreasonable doubt, and applied it to a prosecution under state law. (Apprendi, supra, at\n\n                                              49\n\fpp. 490, 497.) Subsequently the court extended the rule to facts that increase the\nminimum sentence to which a defendant is exposed. (Alleyne v. United States (2013) ___\nU.S. ___ [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2155], overruling Harris v. United States (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.)\n        At its core Apprendi is concerned with the trial of facts that are constitutionally\nindistinguishable from elements of the crime. (See Apprendi, supra, 530 U.S. at p. 494\n[referring to “the constitutionally novel and elusive distinction between ‘elements’ and\n‘sentencing factors’ ”]; id. at p. 478, fn. omitted [noting that distinction was “unknown to\nthe practice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment by court as it existed\nduring the years surrounding our Nation’s founding”].) It seeks to shield, against\nencroachment by the state, the fundamental right not to be subjected to criminal\npunishment unless the state has convinced a jury that the facts prescribed by law as\ngrounds for punishment are true beyond a reasonable doubt. Apprendi bars the state from\nbypassing this shield simply by declaring such a fact to be a “sentencing factor” to be\nfound by a judge.\n        We see no conceptual basis on which to apply this doctrine to the resentencing\nprocedure created by the Reform Act. Here the state, through an act of lenity, has elected\nto reduce a penalty duly imposed under prior law. The fact that the reduction is made to\ndepend on the presence or absence of certain conditions does not make those conditions\nequivalent to elements of the offense. Defendant has already been convicted of the\nunderlying offense; all facts necessary to the imposition of his present sentence were duly\nfound by a jury. The question now is whether the punishment to which that verdict\nsubjected him should be reduced. The existence of a condition precluding its reduction is\nnot a fact necessary to increase his punishment for purposes of Apprendi. For purposes\nof Apprendi, the punishment to which that verdict exposed him was imprisonment for 25\n\n\n\n                                              50\n\fyears to life. A finding that he is too dangerous to permit such a reduction does not\nincrease that punishment.\n       This conclusion is entirely consistent with the origins and core purpose of the jury\ntrial guarantee, as summarized in Apprendi, supra, 530 U.S. at page 477: “[T]he\nhistorical foundation for our recognition of these principles extends down centuries into\nthe common law. ‘[T]o guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of\nrulers,’ and ‘as the great bulwark of [our] civil and political liberties,’ 2 J. Story,\nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States 540-541 (4th ed. 1873), trial by\njury has been understood to require that ‘the truth of every accusation, whether preferred\nin the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the\nunanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant's] equals and neighbours . . . .’ 4 W.\nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone)\n(emphasis added).” Here no “accusation” is any longer at issue. The only relevant\naccusation preferred against defendant had already been duly sustained by a jury long\nbefore the present matter arose. The question is not whether some additional accusation\nis true, but whether facts exist that bar him from the benefits conferred by the Reform\nAct.\n       Nor can we conceive of a way in which a procedure such as that under scrutiny\nhere could be used as a tool of tyranny or oppression. In McMillan, supra, 477 U.S. at\npage 88, the court alluded to the possibility of a statute crafted so that the “tail” of a\njudge-found sentencing fact “wags the dog of the substantive offense.” It is easy to see\nthe vice in such a regime, which would take power away from the body to whom it is\nconstitutionally entrusted, and place it in the hands of an agent, or at least affiliate, of the\nstate, from whom the Sixth Amendment was designed to withhold it. We see no way in\nwhich a retroactive lessening of punishment, whether conditional or not, could ever\nachieve a similar effect, wittingly or otherwise.\n\n                                               51\n\f       The question here may also be analogized to one of the points considered in\nPeople v. Gutierrez (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where the court considered the viability of\nCalifornia’s regime for sentencing juveniles to life without possibility of parole (LWOP)\nin the wake of Miller v. Alabama (2012) 567 U.S. ___ [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959737\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959737/miller-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">]\n(Miller). Miller held that when imposed for an offense committed below the age of 18, a\nmandatory LWOP sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In Gutierrez the\nstate argued, among other things that an LWOP imposed for a juvenile offense under\nCalifornia law did not offend the Miller rule because California law entitles such an\noffender to petition for resentencing at intervals commencing after 15 years’\nimprisonment. In view of this provision, argued the Attorney General, “the initial\nsentence ‘is thus no longer effectively a sentence of life without the possibility of\nparole.’ ” (People v. Guiterrez, supra, at p. 1386.) The Supreme Court emphatically\nrejected this characterization: “A sentence of life without parole under [Penal Code]\nsection 190.5(b) remains fully effective after the enactment of [Penal Code]\nsection 1170(d)(2). That is why [Penal Code] section 1170(d)(2) sets forth a scheme for\nrecalling the sentence and resentencing the defendant. As the Attorney General notes,\n[Penal Code] section 1170(d)(2) provides juvenile offenders convicted of special\ncircumstance murder with ‘three opportunities to have their sentences of life without the\npossibility of parole changed to a sentence of 25 years to life.’ (Italics added.)” (Ibid.)\n       The same is true here. Defendant’s 25-to-life sentence was and is fully effective\nunless and until his sentence is recalled and a new sentence is imposed. Only after the\nsentence is recalled can it be said that a new statutory maximum comes into play. But the\nsentence cannot be recalled if the court finds that doing so would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety. That condition does not increase defendant’s sentence; if\npresent, it operates only to preserve intact the sentence that was originally imposed on\nhim in full compliance with his right to jury trial.\n\n                                              52\n\f       Accordingly, we reaffirm the conclusion in Esparza that defendant was not\nentitled to a jury finding of dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIV.    Presumption in Favor of Resentencing; Burden of Persuasion.\n\n       Defendant contends that section 1170.126 creates a “strong presumption” in favor\nof resentencing. The supporting argument is long on abstractions and short on concrete\napplication to this case. He does not suggest how such a presumption, if found to exist,\nwould contribute to a finding of error in this case. He simply asserts that there was a\npresumption in favor of resentencing, to which—implicitly—the trial court failed to\naccord proper weight.\n       This court has previously rejected the contention that section 1170.126 creates a\npresumption in favor of resentencing. (Esparza, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793;\naccord, Kaulick, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1301-1302.) Again defendant offers no\ncompelling reason to depart from that holding. He asserts that the legal context is similar\nto that which led the Supreme Court to declare that trial courts had only “limited”\ndiscretion to strike prior strikes so as to avoid imposing a third-strike sentence. (People\nv. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135929\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135929/people-v-superior-court-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (Romero).) In a later decision the\ncourt quoted with approval a Court of Appeal’s statement that such relief was warranted\nonly when “ ‘the sentencing court “conclud[es] that an exception to the [three strikes]\nscheme should be made because, for articulable reasons which can withstand scrutiny for\nabuse, this defendant should be treated as though he actually fell outside the Three\nStrikes scheme.” ’ ” (People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337-338.)25 Defendant suggests somewhat\n\n       25\n          Defendant’s appellate counsel betrays an unfortunate tendency to attribute\nstatements, and even quotations, that do not appear in the cited sources. He quotes\nCarmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at page 378 as characterizing relief under Romero as an\n“extraordinary act,” but that phrase appears nowhere in that opinion. Elsewhere he\ndescribes Proposition 36’s findings and declarations as “stat[ing]” that the measure\n                                             53\n\fobliquely that this amounted to a presumption against striking priors—i.e., in favor of the\npunishment prescribed by the Three Strikes Law—and that section 1170.126(f) in effect\n“reversed” the presumption, so that a finding of dangerousness is disfavored, and\nresentencing is favored.\n       The first problem with this analysis is that we know of no decision which\ncharacterized the regime under Romero as a “presumption.” In Romero itself the court\nused that term only in referring to a quite different proposition, i.e., that the Legislature\nintends to enact constitutionally valid statutes. (Romero, supra, 13 Cal.4th at pp. 509; see\nid. at p. 518.) In Carmony the court referred to (1) an inferred presumption by the\nLegislature that a court acts properly in sentencing a defendant in accordance with the\nThree Strikes Law (Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 376); (2) a presumption that, unless\nshown to have acted irrationally or arbitrarily, the sentencing court has “ ‘ ‘acted to\nachieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary determination to impose a\nparticular sentence will not be set aside on review” ’ ” (id. at pp. 377, quoting People v.\nSuperior Court (Alvarez) (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977-97); (3) a “strong presumption” that\nany sentence conforming to the Three Strikes Law is “both rational and proper” (id. at\np. 378); (4) “ ‘the presumption that a trial court ordinarily is presumed [sic] to have\ncorrectly applied the law’ ” (id. at p. 378, quoting People v. Gillispie (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2282249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2282249/people-v-gillispie/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Of these only the third resembles the presumption advocated by\ndefendant, and it differs in at least one critical respect: it is an appellate presumption in\n\n\n“represents the electorate’s judgment that second-strike doubling of a sentence provides\nsufficient punishment for offenders whose current offenses are nonviolent.” The nearest\nthing to such a statement in the findings is that the measure would “[r]estore the Three\nStrikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life sentences only when a\ndefendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.” (Ballot Pamp. Gen Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012) Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012, § 1, subd. (2) at p. 105.) Describing\nthat which may be inferred as having been “stated” is not proper—or effective—\nadvocacy.\n\n                                              54\n\ffavor of the trial court’s ruling when that ruling conforms to a statutory default. Here a\ncomparable presumption would favor a decision by the trial court to grant a Reform Act\npetition over the objection that doing so would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the\npublic. Such a presumption might well be said to exist, but it does not assist defendant\nbecause the trial court here ruled against him\n       Defendant also suggests that a presumption in favor of resentencing and against a\nfinding of disqualifying dangerousness arises from the wording of the Reform Act, i.e.,\nthat a petitioning defendant, if eligible for recall of sentence, “shall be resentenced . . .\nunless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126(f), italics added.) He\nasserts that “[u]nder longstanding statutory construction principles, the ‘shall/unless’\nformulation establishes a strong presumption.” But defendant offers no authority for this\nassertion, and we have found none. Instead he discusses United States Supreme Court\ncases concerning the extent to which parole decisions under state law must satisfy federal\ndue process guarantees. These cases may be characterized as holding that the statutory\nlanguage considered in them gave rise to a “presumption” of liberty sufficient to raise due\nprocess protections. (E.g., Board of Pardons v. Allen (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111914\"><a href=\"/opinion/111914/board-of-pardons-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377-378\n(Allen); Greenholtz v.

The Montana statute at issue in Allen, supra, 482 U.S. at pages\n376-377, did not employ a “shall/unless” structure but rather required that parole be\ngranted “when” the parole board made certain findings. The Supreme Court nonetheless\nfound that the statute “ ‘creat[ed] a presumption that parole release will be granted’ when\nthe designated findings are made.” (Allen, supra, at pp. 377-378.) The court declared\nthat the same was true of the Nebraska statute it had earlier considered in Greenholtz,\nsupra, 442 U.S. at page 11, which did employ a “shall/unless” construction.\n\n\n\n                                               55\n\f        However we are not persuaded that the “presumptions” found in those cases have\nany bearing on this matter. They are not concerned with the principles governing the trial\ncourt’s determination of any issue, or those governing appellate review of such an issue.\nRather they consider whether the state parole laws at issue gave rise to such a “legitimate\nexpectation of release” (Greenholtz, supra, 442 U.S. at p. 12) as to generate a “liberty\ninterest” protected by the due process clause. (Allen, supra, 482 U.S. at p. 370). Apart\nfrom the shared use of the term “presumption,” we fail to see any connection between\nthose cases and the matters at issue here.\n        This is not to suggest that the “shall/unless” construction is meaningless. The\n“unless” clause clearly constitutes an exception or proviso, and as such should be\nnarrowly construed under general principles of statutory construction. (See Carter v.\nCohen (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

However defendant has not couched any argument in terms of the\nconstruction of the proviso, and we do not readily see how such an argument might be\nmade.\n        A more pertinent principle may be that “the party seeking to rely on an exception\nto a general rule has the burden of proving the exception.” (Standard Pacific Corp. v.\nSuperior Court (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Here this unquestionably meant that the prosecution bore the\nevidentiary burden of proving that resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger. (Accord, Esparza, supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at pp. 742-743; Kaulick, supra,\n215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\n         The record is somewhat ambiguous with respect to trial court’s allocation of the\nburden of persuasion. At the outset of the hearing the court said to the prosecutor, “Mr.\nCarr, it is your burden, please begin.” This would seem to reflect recognition that it was\nthe prosecutor’s burden to establish that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to the public. However, at the conclusion of the hearing the court expressed its\nfinding in negative terms, stating that it found “nothing right up until the most recent\ntriggering offense to suggest to this Court that the petitioner presents anything but a\nsubstantial risk to public safety if he should be resentenced and released and for those\nreasons I’m going to deny the petition.” (Italics added.) The court’s very reluctance to\nstate as a positive fact that defendant actually posed such a risk casts some doubt on the\nassiduousness with which it applied the burden of proof it had earlier seemed to\nacknowledge. We need not attempt to parse the court’s remarks further, however, for we\nare remanding the matter for further proceedings, in which the burden will rest squarely\nupon the prosecution to establish as a fact that resentencing would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to the public.\n         This conclusion—that respondent bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of\ndangerousness—has the same practical effect as declaring that the statute creates a\nrebuttable evidentiary presumption affecting the burden of proof. (See Evid. Code,\n§§ 605, 115.) And we may also agree that the statute gives rise to a strong appellate\npresumption in favor of a ruling granting a Reform Act petition. Beyond that, however,\nwe are not convinced that the statute gives rise to a presumption in any relevant or useful\nsense.\n\n                                             57\n\f V.    Applicability of Rules of Evidence\n\n       Finally, defendant charges the trial court with error in admitting hearsay evidence,\nincluding his prison disciplinary records and police reports implicating him, via\ncompound hearsay, in the 1981 and 1983 murders and the 1983 arson. He contends that\nthe rules of evidence applicable to trial also apply to hearings held pursuant to\nsection 1170.126(f) to determine whether a petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety. His argument on this point is, again, less than explicit. First he\nmakes a cursory allusion to Evidence Code section 300, which states, “Except as\notherwise provided by statute, this code applies in every action before the Supreme Court\nor a court of appeal or superior court, including proceedings in such actions conducted by\na referee, court commissioner, or similar officer, but does not apply in grand jury\nproceedings.”26 (Evid. Code, § 300 (§ 300); see id., § 105 [“ ‘Action’ includes a civil\naction and a criminal action.”].)\n       On its face this statute would seem to indicate that the codified rules of evidence\napply in every criminal proceeding to which a statute does not expressly declare them\ninapplicable. However, a large body of caselaw has developed which may be very\nbroadly characterized as countenancing the admission of objectionable evidence—i.e.,\nevidence that would be excluded in an ordinary action if properly objected to—in post-\nconviction proceedings such as sentencing and revocation of probation or parole, unless\nthe evidence is so unreliable, or its admission is otherwise so unfair, as to infringe upon\nthe defendant’s due process rights. (E.g., People v. O’Connell (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2261751\"><a href=\"/opinion/2261751/people-v-oconnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

So far as we can\nsee, none of these cases have considered the effect of section 300. Instead they apply\nconstitutional principles largely developed by the United States Supreme Court.

That\ncase was solely concerned, however, with the defendant’s right to due process and, more\nspecifically, to confront adverse witnesses—specifically the authors of statements in a\ndiagnostic report prepared pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.03. In addressing a\nstatutory argument somewhat similar to the argument that could be made under section\n300, the court noted that section 1203.03 itself brought the report within an exception to\nthe hearsay rule. (Id. at p. 754, fn. 2.) The case therefore does not support the\nproposition that the Evidence Code is inapplicable to post-conviction proceedings.\n\n                                            59\n\f       Of course, constitutional limitations on the admission of evidence are a floor, not a\nceiling. If greater restrictions are imposed by statute, then those restrictions will\nnecessarily govern in the absence of some distinct ground not to give effect to the statute.\n(See People v. Holmes (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257485\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257485/people-v-holmes/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Yet so far as we\ncan tell, the potential effect of section 300—and through it, the rest of the Evidence\nCode—has gone wholly unremarked in these cases.\n       We find, however, that the issue is not ripe for review. We see no indication that\ndefendant ever objected to evidence below on the ground that it violated rules codified in\nthe Evidence Code. Defendant did object to evidence below, but only on the ground that\nit did not meet the constitutional standards previously alluded to. Thus he asserted that\nspecified portions of the prosecutor’s recitation of his history, “and all supporting\nexhibits,” constituted “unreliable hearsay”—a formula pregnant with the concession that\nreliable hearsay would be admissible. (Capitalization altered and italics added.) He\ncompared the challenged evidence to evidence that had been held sufficiently reliable—\nor not—to be considered in sentencing-related proceedings. He quoted the statement in\nPeople v. Eckley (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256290\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256290/people-v-eckley/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(See Evid. Code, § 353, subd. (a).) We are\nparticularly inclined to enforce this requirement where the objection is of such a character\nthat its timely assertion might have permitted the proponent of the evidence to cure the\ndefect. Here the court was presented with voluminous documentary evidence including\npolice and probation reports, prison records, and transcripts of testimony. The absence of\nspecific objections prevented the prosecution from attempting to cure any objections the\ncourt might otherwise have been inclined to sustain.\n       A similar difficulty attends defendant’s constitutional objections. He objected\nblow to specific sections of the prosecutor’s brief “and all supporting exhibits.” Nor does\nhis brief on appeal target specific items of evidence, stating only that “hearsay like\nMr. Cordova’s prison disciplinary records and prior police investigative reports—linking\nhim to a murder, arson, and rape but resulting in no convictions—should not have been\nadmitted.” But some prison records, and even police reports, may have been admissible\nover a hearsay objection—at least in part—as business or official records. (See Evid.\nCode, §§ 1270-1272, 1280-1284.)\n       We recognize that the task of winnowing objectionable from non-objectionable\nevidence is a daunting one when, as here, the state presents several large volumes of\ndocumentary evidence with nothing resembling an adequate index or other means of\nnavigation.28 The quality of the copies is, for the most part, so poor that the text cannot\n\n\n       28\n          The difficulty is illustrated by defendant’s objection below to section “II.A.” of\nthe prosecutor’s opposition memorandum “and all supporting exhibits.” The cited\nsection recounts defendant’s supposed juvenile history, for which the prosecutor cited\n“Report of Adult Probation Officer, Docket #56487 dated October 18, 1973 (Exhibit 6).”\nPerhaps there was a conspicuous exhibit tab labeled “6” in the trial court record, but on\nappeal the only way to find this document is to thumb through the transcript looking for\nan otherwise blank page bearing that legend.\n\n                                             61\n\fbe digitized and therefore cannot be searched.29 The sheer volume and lack of coherent\norganization of such a presentation may itself raise questions of fundamental fairness.\nTrial by avalanche is bad enough in civil cases between well-heeled litigants. In a\ncriminal case between busy publicly-funded counsel it raises at least a whiff of denial of\ndue process.30 The trial court would act well within its powers in requiring the prosecutor\nto provide a thematic or other index making it possible to frame evidentiary issues in a\nmanageable fashion. At a minimum, the materials should be consecutively page-\nnumbered so that citations to specific documents do not require paging through whole\ntranscripts searching for exhibit numbers, or worse, titles and dates.\n       29\n           This characteristic is exacerbated by the clerk’s apparent practice of reducing\ncopies of file materials by something like 33 percent in copying them for the appellate\ntranscript. The rules of court require the transcript to contain specified documents, not\nminiatures of those documents.\n       30\n           An illustration of the kind of difficulty that arises from such a showing is\nprovided by the prosecutor’s account of a “rape” supposedly occurring on\nJanuary 1, 1973, when defendant was 18. According to the prosecutor’s memorandum,\ndefendant and another youth “grabbed” the 15-year old victim as she was passing a hotel\nand “forced” her into a room where the rape occurred. This was indeed the victim’s\ninitial account, but after it was compromised by further investigation she acknowledged\naccompanying the youths to the room voluntarily. Defendant, the second youth, and a\nthird youth who was apparently not charged all claimed that she had also voluntarily\nconsented to intercourse. She continued to deny this, but defendant was booked and\ncharged only for intercourse with a minor. The disposition of that charge is not reflected\nin the record. But nothing before the trial court reliably established a forcible rape.\n\n       At least two of the items in the prosecutor’s criminal history of defendant rested\nentirely on cryptic entries in a document cited by the prosecutor as a “Manual Criminal\nHistory.” The entries, identical save for arrest and disposition dates about a week apart,\nstate only “ ‘Arrested in prison’ 4573.6 PC / . . . . DA/CA rej, int.just.,” which the\nprosecutor translates as “ ‘Arrested in Prison’ for a violation of Penal Code §4573.6\n(Possession of a Controlled Substance). Case was rejected – Interest of Justice.”\n\n   At least one entry in the history, asserting a parole violation consisting of access to\nammunition and positive tests for controlled substances, is supported by no citations to\nevidence at all.\n\n                                             62\n\f       In any event, our remand will provide ample opportunity to bring evidentiary\nissues into focus, as they are not in the present appeal. Defendant will be free to assert\nany ground of objection, but should target challenged items as precisely as the record\npermits, stating grounds specifically, if he hopes to preserve the issue for further\nappellate review.\n\n                                      DISPOSITION\n\n       The order denying the petition for resentencing is reversed for further proceedings\nin accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\f                                 APPENDIX\n                       PUBLIC DEBATE ON PROPOSITION 47:\n                  SOME WEB SOURCES AVAILABLE AS OF JUNE 2016\n\n1.

Cordova\nH041050\n\n\n\n\n                                   69\n\fH041050 People v. Cordova (Dissent)\n       I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion’s holding that Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” applies to petitions for\nresentencing under Proposition 36. (See People v. Florez, previously published at </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, review granted and opinion superseded June 8, 2016, S234168). None\nof the ballot materials accompanying Proposition 47 mentioned Proposition 36, and there\nis no indication that the electorate intended to modify Proposition 36’s definition of an\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” I would hold that Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” is inapplicable to\nProposition 36, and Proposition 47 contains a drafting error that must be judicially\ncorrected.1\n       Additionally, the majority concludes that defendant’s argument that the rules of\nevidence applies to hearings under Penal Code section 1170.126 (unspecified statutory\nreferences are to the Penal Code) is not ripe for review, because defendant failed to object\nto the introduction of certain evidence below. Here, defendant maintains that the court\nerred in admitting hearsay evidence, including his prison disciplinary records and police\nreports implicating him in the 1981 and 1983 murders and the 1983 arson. I would find\nthat defendant’s argument pertaining to the introduction of hearsay evidence in\nsection 1170.126 hearings is meritless.\n       Defendant’s argument is significantly undermined by section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (g)(2), which expressly authorizes courts to consider petitioners’\n“disciplinary record[s].” A section 1170.126 petition is a postjudgment vehicle by which\ncertain legally convicted and sentenced inmates may benefit from the later enacted Three\nStrikes Reform Act.\n 1\n   Based on this conclusion, I express no opinion regarding the majority opinion’s\nconclusion regarding the retroactivity of the definition. As the majority notes, this issue\nis presently being reviewed by the California Supreme Court.\n\f         Thus, in my view, a section 1170.126, subdivision (f) hearing is more akin to other\nposttrial proceedings—such as parole revocation hearings or sentencing—than it is to\ntrial, where the full protections of the Evidence Code apply. Hearsay evidence is\nadmissible at parole revocation hearings, so long as it “ ‘ “bears a substantial degree of\ntrustworthiness,” ’ ” as determined by the trial court. (In re Miller (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247550\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247550/in-re-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1235.) It is likewise admissible at sentencing proceedings, so long as\nthere is “a substantial basis for believing [it] is reliable.” (People v. Lamb (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683 [“Due process does not require that a criminal defendant be\nafforded the same evidentiary protections at sentencing proceedings as exist at trial.”];\nPeople v. Arbuckle (1978) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382381\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382381/people-v-arbuckle/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 754 [a sentencing court may consider a broad\nrange of information, including responsible unsworn or out-of-court statements\nconcerning the convicted person’s life and characteristics].) Therefore, hearsay is\nadmissible at section 1170.126, subdivision (f) hearings so long as there is a substantial\nbasis for believing the evidence is reliable.\n         I do, however, agree with the majority opinion’s conclusion that defendant’s equal\nprotection argument has no merit, the dangerousness finding need not be submitted to a\njury and found beyond a reasonable doubt, and there is no presumption in favor of\nresentencing.\n         Lastly, based on my conclusion that the Proposition 47’s definition of “an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” does not apply to petitions for resentencing\nunder Proposition 36, I would find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\nconcluded that defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger if resentenced.\n“Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court,” the abuse\nof discretion standard applies on appeal. (People v. Rodrigues (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613958\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613958/people-v-rodrigues/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1124.)\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that, on previous grants of\nprobation and parole, defendant has largely shown himself unable to refrain from\nreoffending for any appreciable length of time. Substantial evidence also supports the\ntrial court’s conclusion that many of defendant’s convictions involved weapons, which\nplainly can expose the public to danger. Specifically, the record shows defendant was\nconvicted of attempted armed robbery, armed residential robbery, possession of a firearm\nby a felon (twice), possession of a deadly or dangerous weapon, and possession of a\nconcealed dirk or dagger. The trial court also found that “defendant has numerous\ncriminal convictions that are associated with being under the influence of drugs,” which\nled it to conclude that “addiction and . . . controlled substance abuse has played . . . an\nincredibly significant role in [defendant’s] prior criminal behavior.” In support of its\nfinding regarding defendant’s drug-related criminal convictions, the court erroneously\nmentioned “the 1983 arson in jail,” for which there was no conviction. But, despite that\nmisstatement, substantial evidence nevertheless supports the court’s finding that\ndefendant was convicted of drug-related crimes on numerous occasions. The record\nshows defendant was convicted of driving under the influence three times, possession of\na controlled substance four times, and being under the influence of a controlled substance\ntwice. The court’s conclusion that “addiction and . . . controlled substance abuse has\nplayed . . . an incredibly significant role in [defendant’s] prior criminal behavior” is\nsupported by those convictions, as well as by evidence that defendant admitted to being\nunder the influence of drugs and alcohol during the 1973 armed residential robbery.\n       With respect to defendant’s record of rehabilitation while incarcerated,\nsubstantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that defendant did not participate\nin any self-help programming for a number of years in the late-2000s. (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (g)(2).) The record further supports the trial court’s finding that, during that same\nperiod, defendant did not address his drug addiction. While defendant told Dr. Barron\n\n                                              3\n\fthat he abstained from drug use during those years, as a longtime drug user, there can be\nno doubt he would have benefitted from continued programming to address his addiction.\nThe court also properly considered defendant’s disciplinary record. (Ibid.) The court\ncorrectly noted that defendant had been disciplined numerous times for drug-related\ninfractions in the months leading up to the filing of his petition. Based on the 2004\nincident in which defendant was placed in administrative segregation after prison staff\nwas told defendant threatened another inmate with a shank and defendant’s 2006 fight\nwith three other inmates, the court concluded that defendant demonstrated “potential\naggressive behavior” on two occasions. I agree that the reports of those incidents support\nthe conclusion that defendant was potentially aggressive on both occasions.\n       The court further found, based on the same two events, that defendant has had\n“continued proximity [to] and [an] apparent need to surround himself with weapons.” I\nagree with defendant that substantial evidence does not support that finding. In 2004, no\nshank was found and no disciplinary report was filed. There merely was a confidential\ntip, which does not constitute reasonable, credible, and solid evidence that defendant was\narmed in prison in 2004. (Meyers v. Board of Administration etc. Fund (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 260 [substantial evidence is evidence of “ ‘ “ ‘ponderable legal\nsignificance’ ” ’ ” that is “ ‘ “ ‘reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value’ ” ’ ”].)\nIn 2006, guards found a razor blade six feet away from where defendant and three other\ninmates had a physical fight. The court suggests that defendant was the one who was\narmed because one of the inmates said a razor blade was pulled on him and the other two\nsaid they did not know how the fight started. In fact, defendant told guards, “I don’t\nknow what happened.” A second inmate said “I don’t even know”; a third said he “just\ngot in a fight”; and a fourth reported that a “dude pulled a blade on me.” Those\nstatements do not constitute substantial evidence that the razor blade belonged to\ndefendant.\n\n                                                4\n\f       Finally, the court considered other relevant evidence as permitted by\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (g)(3). First, the court found defendant was “implicated”\nin murders in 1981 and 1983. Above, I concluded the court was permitted to rely on\nevidence of the murders, even if it constituted hearsay, so long as it was reliable. The\nevidence of defendant’s involvement in the murders included the declaration of an\ninvestigator with the Santa Clara District Attorney’s office, who also was a retired police\nofficer. Because the declaration was made by a law enforcement professional under\npenalty of perjury, I find that it contained sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy due\nprocess. That declaration alone provides substantial evidence to support the court’s\nconclusion that defendant was implicated in two murders. Accordingly, I conclude the\ncourt did not err in relying on evidence of the murders or in reaching that conclusion.\nSecond, the court relied on defendant’s mental health and disciplinary records to find that\ndefendant has not overcome his drug addiction. That finding is supported by substantial\nevidence. Defendant’s prison health records show that he used morphine between 2011\nand January 23, 2014. Despite expressing a desire to stop using the drug in 2012 and\n2013, he achieved only brief periods of sobriety. Defendant underwent treatment for\nmorphine detox between January 24 and January 30, 2014. Because his health records\nafter February 18, 2014, are not in the record, there is no evidence that he has remained\nsober since that time.2\n       In sum, the court’s factual findings are largely supported by substantial evidence.\nThe court did incorrectly refer to the 1983 arson as a conviction in finding that defendant\n 2\n   Defendant told Dr. Barron in April 2014 that he was still not using drugs. However, as\nthe trial court noted, defendant made untrue statements to Dr. Barron. For example, he\ntold Dr. Barron that one DUI was the only crime he committed while under the influence\nof drugs. But the record indicates defendant committed numerous crimes while under the\ninfluence of drugs, including the 1973 armed residential robbery, three DUIs, and two\ninstances of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Therefore, defendant’s\nclaim of being drug-free for four months is not credible.\n\n                                                5\n\fhad been convicted of numerous drug-related crimes. However, because the ultimate\nfinding is supported by substantial evidence, the court’s mistaken belief about the 1983\narson was not “critical to its decision” and thus does not establish an abuse of discretion.\n(People v. Cluff (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286872\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286872/people-v-cluff/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998.)\n       The court also found that defendant was twice armed in prison, which is not\nsupported by substantial evidence. That finding, however, likewise was not critical to the\ncourt’s decision. I acknowledge that the court referred to defendant’s frequent possession\nof weapons, including “firearms” and “cutting instruments,” as its “greatest concern\nperhaps . . . .” But even disregarding the prison incidents, the record shows that\ndefendant was frequently (and illegally) in possession of weapons when he was not in\ncustody between 1973 and 1995.\n       Based on the foregoing, I cannot find that the court abused its discretion in\nconcluding the defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public if\nresentenced. Defendant has a record of nearly continuous criminal behavior when\noutside of prison. Much of his criminal history involves weapons and drug use, both of\nwhich pose a risk of danger to the public, especially when combined. There also is\nevidence that, contrary to defendant’s contention on appeal, defendant has a history of\nphysically harming his victims—namely, the victims of the 1981 and 1983 murders.\nDefendant’s record in prison shows his drug addiction, for which he sought no help\nduring the majority of his lengthy time in prison, remains a problem. His disciplinary\nrecord shows he remains unable to follow the rules or avoid violent confrontations.\n       Accordingly, I would affirm the order denying defendant’s petition for\nresentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                Premo, J.\n\n                                              6\n\fTrial Court:                                 Santa Clara County\n                                             Superior Court No.: 185632\n\n\nTrial Judge:                                 The Honorable Linda R.
