This is a crack cocaine case brought by two currently\nincarcerated defendants seeking retroactive relief from racially discriminatory mandatory\nminimum sentences imposed on them in 2005. The Fair Sentencing Act was passed in\nAugust 2010 to “restore fairness to Federal cocaine sentencing” laws that had unfairly\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582            United States v. Blewett, et al.                        Page 2\n\n\nimpacted blacks for almost 25 years. The Fair Sentencing Act repealed portions of the\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that instituted a 100-to-1 ratio between crack and powder\ncocaine, treating one gram of crack as equivalent to 100 grams of powder cocaine for\nsentencing purposes. The 100-to-1 ratio had long been acknowledged by many in the\nlegal system to be unjustified and adopted without empirical support. The Fair\nSentencing Act lowered the ratio to a more lenient 18-to-1 ratio. However, thousands\nof inmates, most black, languish in prison under the old, discredited ratio because the\nFair Sentencing Act was not made explicitly retroactive by Congress.\n\n          In this case, we hold, inter alia, that the federal judicial perpetuation of the\nracially discriminatory mandatory minimum crack sentences for those defendants\nsentenced under the old crack sentencing law, as the government advocates, would\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause, as incorporated into the Fifth Amendment by the\ndoctrine of Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954) (Fifth Amendment forbids federal\nracial discrimination in the same way as the Fourteenth Amendment forbids state racial\ndiscrimination). As Professor William J. Stuntz, the late Harvard criminal law professor,\nhas observed, “persistent bias occurred with respect to the contemporary enforcement\nof drug laws where, in the 1990s and early 2000s, blacks constituted a minority of\nregular users of crack cocaine but more than 80 percent of crack defendants.” The\nCollapse of American Criminal Justice 184 (2011). He recommended that we “redress\nthat discrimination” with “the underused concept of ‘equal protection of the laws.’” Id.\nat 297.\n\n          In this opinion, we will set out both the constitutional and statutory reasons the\nold, racially discriminatory crack sentencing law must now be set aside in favor of the\nnew sentencing law enacted by Congress as the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. The Act\nshould apply to all defendants, including those sentenced prior to its passage. We\ntherefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for resentencing.\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582                 United States v. Blewett, et al.                                      Page 3\n\n\n                                                     I.\n\n         The district court judge, bound by unavoidable mandatory minimums, sentenced\nthe Blewett1 cousins in 2005 to a mandatory minimum of ten years each under the old\n100-to-1 crack cocaine law, sentences based on the quantity of crack cocaine possessed.\nThe Blewetts seek retroactive resentencing under 18 U.S.C § 3582(c)(2)2 and 28 U.S.C.\n§ 994(u)3 because the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, P.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372,\nas implemented by new sentencing guidelines, has substantially reduced crack cocaine\nsentences, including the mandatory minimum sentences imposed in this case. See\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b) (increasing the amount of crack from 50 grams to 280 grams to\ntrigger the 10-year mandatory minimum and from 5 grams to 28 grams to trigger the\nfive-year mandatory minimum). If the Blewetts were sentenced today under the revised\ncrack law, they would not be subject to a statutory minimum because the quantity of\ncrack involved falls below the threshold for any statutory minimum.\n\n         The old 100-to-1 crack cocaine ratio has led to the mass incarceration of\nthousands of nonviolent prisoners under a law widely acknowledged as racially\ndiscriminatory. There were approximately 30,000 federal prisoners (about 15 percent\nof all federal prisoners) serving crack cocaine sentences in 2011. United States Sent’g\nComm’n, Analysis of the Impact of Guideline Implementation of the Fair Sentencing\n\n\n\n\n         1\n           Although Cornelius and Jarreous spell their last names differently, we will use the “Blewett”\nspelling in this opinion for ease of reference.\n         2\n             18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) provides in relevant part:\n         in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on\n         a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\n         pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), . . . the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after\n         considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\n         if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the\n         Sentencing Commission.\n         3\n             This statute provides:\n         If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines\n         applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what\n         circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of\n         imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582              United States v.

Page 4\n\n\nAct of 2010 if the Amendment Were Applied Retroactively, at 12 (May 2011).4\nThousands of these prisoners are incarcerated for life or for 20, 10, or 5 years under\nmandatory minimum crack cocaine sentences imposed prior to the passage of the Fair\nSentencing Act. More than 80 percent of federal prisoners serving crack cocaine\nsentences are black. See, e.g., United States Sent’g Comm’n, Annual Report 2011 at 37\n(83%); United States Sent’g Comm’n, 1996 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics\ntbl.29, at 47 (85.8%). In fiscal year 2010, before the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act,\nalmost 4,000 defendants, mainly black, received mandatory minimum sentences for\ncrack cocaine. United States Sent’g Comm’n, 2010 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing\nStatistics tbl.43.\n\n        In 2010, recognizing the statistical evidence of widespread racial discrimination\nbased on empirical studies, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act. The preamble to\nthe Fair Sentencing Act, recognizing racial injustice, states that it is designed “to restore\nfairness to Federal cocaine sentencing.” Justice Breyer’s majority opinion in Dorsey v.\nUnited States, 132 S. Ct. 2321, 2328 (2012), states that the new law was adopted\n“because the public had come to understand sentences embodying the 100-to-1 ratio\nas reflecting unjustified race-based differences.” The Chairman of the Judiciary\nCommittee, Senator Patrick Leahy, reflecting on the purpose of the new Act, stated that\nthe former 100-to-1 ratio law is “one of the most notorious symbols of racial\ndiscrimination in the modern criminal justice system.” 156 Cong. Rec. S1683 (daily ed.\nMar. 17, 2010). Many members of Congress stated that the old law should be changed\nbecause it was racially discriminatory and not based on any coherent rationale.5\n\n\n        4\n          All the Sentencing Commission publications cited herein are available on the Commission’s\nwebsite (www.ussc.gov).\n        5\n           Here is a representative sample of statements by members of Congress concerning the purpose\nof the Fair Sentencing Act:\n        155 Cong. Rec. S10491 (daily ed. Oct. 15, 2009) (statement of Sen. Dick Durbin,\n        Assistant Senate Majority Leader) (“Vice President Joe Biden, one of the authors of the\n        legislation creating this disparity in sentencing, has said: ‘Each of the myths upon\n        which we based the disparity has since been dispelled or altered.’”); 156 Cong. Rec.\n        H6202 (daily ed. July 28, 2010) (statement of Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott, Chairman\n        of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security)\n        (“We are not blaming anybody for what happened in 1986, but we have had years of\n        experience and have determined that there is no justification for the 100-to-1 ratio.”);\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582             United States v. Blewett, et al.                                     Page 5\n\n\n       Yet, despite the passage of the Act and the Supreme Court’s condemnation of the\n100-to-1 ratio in Dorsey, more than 17,000 such crack prisoners sentenced under the old,\nracially discriminatory law are not eligible for resentencing. The majority of these\npeople, the government claims, cannot benefit from the new law because they received\na sentence under the old mandatory minimums or received a career offender designation\n(requiring two previous drug convictions). So according to figures supplied by the\nSentencing Commission, less than one-half of those given excessive, racially\ndiscriminatory sentences, like the ones imposed on the Blewetts, are eligible for relief.\nUnited States Sent’g Comm’n, Analysis of the Impact of Guideline Implementation of\nthe Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 if the Amendment Were Applied Retroactively, at 12\n(May 2011).\n\n       Congress, as Justice Breyer’s opinion in Dorsey confirmed, intended in the Fair\nSentencing Act to repeal and redress the wrongs of the older crack sentencing statute that\nCongress believed had proven itself to be arbitrary, irrational, and racially\ndiscriminatory. The status quo has now been overturned. The question remaining is:\nhow retroactive is the new law? Fully? Or only partially, just covering a minority of\nthose wrongly sentenced?\n\n       The answer to the question turns on our interpretation of principles of equal\nprotection and several interlocking rules, provisions of sentencing law, including\nbackground canons of statutory interpretation, the Fair Sentencing Act, the previous\nstatutes it repealed or modified, and the sentencing guideline provisions propagated\npursuant to it. We regard as the most important consideration the clear congressional\n\n\n       156 Cong. Rec. H6202 (daily ed. July 28, 2010) (Statement of Rep. Daniel E. Lungren)\n       (“We initially came out of committee with a 20-to-1 ratio. By the time we finished on\n       the floor, it was 100-to-1. We didn’t really have an evidentiary basis for it, but that’s\n       what we did, thinking we were doing the right thing at the time.”);156 Cong. Rec.\n       S1682 (daily ed. Mar. 17, 2010) (statement of Sen. Patrick Leahy) (“The racial\n       imbalance that has resulted from the cocaine sentencing disparity disparages the\n       Constitution’s promise of equal treatment for all Americans.”); 156 Cong. Rec. H6198\n       (daily ed. July 28, 2010) (statement of Rep. James E. Clyburn, House Majority Whip)\n       (“The current drug sentencing policy is the single greatest cause of the record levels of\n       incarceration in our country. One in every 31 Americans is in prison or on parole or on\n       probation, including one in 11 African Americans. This is unjust and runs contrary to\n       our fundamental principles of equal protection under the law.”); 156 Cong. Rec. H6203\n       (daily ed. July 28, 2010) (statement of Rep. Steny Hoyer) (“The 100-to-1 disparity is\n       counterproductive and unjust.”).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582                United States v. Blewett, et al.                                    Page 6\n\n\npurpose to end the long, racially discriminatory sentences imposed in crack cocaine\ncases over the past 25 years and the fact that the perpetuation of such sentences is\nunconstitutional.6\n\n                                                     II.\n\n         We readily acknowledge that no party challenges the constitutionality of denying\nretroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act to people who were sentenced under\nthe old regime. That does not mean, however, that the constitutional question is\nirrelevant as we determine whether the Blewetts are entitled to a sentence reduction.\nThat is because we are constrained to interpret statutes and sentencing guidelines so as\nto avoid potential conflict with the Constitution. The constitutional-doubt canon means\nthat a statute or other authoritative text should be interpreted in a way that avoids\ncreating an unconstitutional law or placing its constitutionality in doubt. The most\nrecent treatise on the subject of canons of construction quotes a statement defining the\nmeaning of the constitutional-doubt canon found in United States ex rel. Attorney\nGeneral v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909): “[W]here a statute is\nsusceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional\nquestions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt\nthe latter.” Antonin Scalia & Bryan Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal\nTexts 247 (2012). The interpretation the government puts forth to deny retroactive\napplication of the Fair Sentencing Act would result in a violation of equal protection.\n\n\n\n\n         6\n           Like passing a foreign ship at night with an “ahoy,” our dissenting colleague starts with a poetic\nmetaphor about “setting sail . . . without any legal ballast.” The dissent then refuses to acknowledge, come\nto grips with or rebut the equal protection argument in this case. The dissent fails even to acknowledge\nthe language of the Supreme Court in Dorsey stating that Congress found the old 100-to-1 ratio to be\nracially discriminatory and therefore reduced the penalty to 18-to-1. Nor does the dissent acknowledge\nor rebut the many legislative history statements that the law the dissent would continue to apply is blatantly\nracially discriminatory. The dissent only cites United States v. Hammond, No. 12-5522, 2013 WL\n1363908 (6th Cir. Apr. 5, 2013), as authority. The Hammond case does not purport to deal with the equal\nprotection problem. A dissent that refuses to acknowledge the main problem in a case and then relies\nprimarily on a case that does not mention the problem is not responsive or relevant. In order to be\nresponsive, disagreement at least requires a discussion about why we should continue to hold thousands\nof people in jail who are there because of a law that is acknowledged to be racially discriminatory by a\nmajority of the Supreme Court and by the vote of a large majority of the Congress of the United States.\nCongress does not often acknowledge that it passed a racially discriminatory law and then try to redress\nits own prior mistake. To be relevant, a dissent must at least try to deal with that issue.\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                        Page 7\n\n\n       Quite apart from the legal doctrine that guides the Equal Protection Clause (as\nincorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment), the discriminatory\nnature of prior crack sentences is no longer a point of legitimate debate. The racially\ndiscriminatory impact of the 100:1 sentencing scheme surfaced early on when statistics\nshowed that nearly one hundred percent of all crack defendants were non-white. See\nUnited States Sent’g Comm’n, 2011 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics tbl.34\n(94% nonwhite); LaJuana Davis, Rock, Powder, Sentencing—Making Disparate Impact\nEvidence Relevant in Crack Cocaine Sentencing, 14 J. Gender Race & Just. 375, 386-88\n& n.68 (2011). From 1988 to 1995, federal prosecutors prosecuted no whites under the\ncrack provisions in 17 states, including major cities such as Boston, Denver, Chicago,\nMiami, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Dan Weikel, War on Crack Targets Minorities over\nWhites, L.A. Times, May 21, 1995, http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-21/news/mn-\n4468_1_crack-cocaine. These alarming numbers are not unlike the Supreme Court’s\nearly cases of facially neutral laws creating an overwhelmingly disparate result. See Yick\nWo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886).\n\n       The Sentencing Commission and the Supreme Court recognized the disparity as\nwell. In the 1990s, the Supreme Court first recognized the discriminatory impact of the\n100:1 ratio. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 479 (1996) (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) (“[I]t is undisputed that the brunt of the elevated federal penalties falls\nheavily on blacks.”). In a 1995 report to Congress, the Sentencing Commission said,\n“The 100-to-1 crack cocaine to powder cocaine quantity ratio is a primary cause of the\ngrowing disparity between sentences for Black and White federal defendants.” United\nStates Sent’g Comm’n, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing\nPolicy, at Chapter 7D (Feb. 1995). In 1995, the Commission submitted to Congress an\namendment to the sentencing guidelines that would have equalized penalties between\ncrack and powder cocaine. Congress rejected the recommendation. In 1997, the\nCommission unanimously recommended that Congress lower the 100-to 1 ratio and gave\nCongress several options to adjust the disparity between crack and powder cocaine\npenalties. See United States Sent’g Comm’n, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine\nand Federal Sentencing Policy (Apr. 1997).            Congress took no action on the\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                          Page 8\n\n\nrecommendations.       In 2002, the Commission again “unanimously and firmly”\nrecommended to Congress that the drug quantity ratio between crack and powder\ncocaine be reduced. United States Sent’g Comm’n, Report to the Congress: Cocaine and\nFederal Sentencing Policy viii (May 2002). While the Sentencing Commission adjusted\nthe guideline ranges for crack cocaine in 2007 in Amendment 706 to decrease the length\nof sentences, Congress made no changes to the 100-to-1 ratio to adjust the mandatory\nminimums for crack cocaine until it passed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010. Hence\nthousands of black defendants now remain in federal prisons under long sentences, some\nfor life.\n\n        In view of the statistical facts and the widespread congressional consensus\nleading to the adoption of the Fair Sentencing Act’s remedial provisions, there can be\nno doubt that the old crack law was racially discriminatory in effect. As a matter of legal\ndoctrine, there is no equal protection violation without discriminatory intent. See\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976). When the old 100-to-1 crack cocaine statute\nwas adopted, it presumably did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there\nwas no intent or design to discriminate on a racial basis. Its adoption was simply a\nmistake.    Since 1986, however, we have gained knowledge of the old statute’s\ndevastating effect on blacks. Congress itself acknowledged this problem by enacting the\nFair Sentencing Act.\n\n        The Fair Sentencing Act was a step forward, but it did not finish the job. The\nracial discrimination continues by virtue of a web of statutes, sentencing guidelines, and\ncourt cases that maintain the harsh provisions for those defendants sentenced before the\nFair Sentencing Act. If we continue now with a construction of the statute that\nperpetuates the discrimination, there is no longer any defense that the discrimination is\nunintentional. The discriminatory nature of the old sentencing regime is so obvious that\nit cannot seriously be argued that race does not play a role in the failure to retroactively\napply the Fair Sentencing Act. A “disparate impact” case now becomes an intentional\nsubjugation or discriminatory purpose case. Like slavery and Jim Crow laws, the\nintentional maintenance of discriminatory sentences is a denial of equal protection.\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                         Page 9\n\n\n       This analysis is undermined by neither McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987),\nnor Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979), two cases\nthat on first glance might appear to sanction the discrimination at issue here. In\nMcCleskey, the Supreme Court held that a detailed study showing racial disparity in the\napplication of Georgia’s death penalty could not make out intentional discrimination.\nStatistical proof of discriminatory application was not enough; McCleskey was required\nto “prove that the Georgia Legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty statute\nbecause of an anticipated racially discriminatory effect.” McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 298.\nHere Congress enacted the new law to remedy racial discrimination. McCleskey’s\ndisapproval of statistical evidence is also distinguishable. McCleskey was obviously\nconcerned to preserve a system of criminal enforcement where multiple decisionmakers\nwere involved and where each decision to impose the death penalty required assessment\nof the individual defendant’s unique personal, mitigating characteristics. See id. at\n292–97. But in the context of crack cocaine sentencing, the defendant’s independent\ncharacteristics do not factor into the equation, and the decisionmaker’s choice is a\ndiscretionless mandatory minimum. In the general course of things, the prosecutor will\ncharge based on an objectively verifiable quantity of crack, and the court will impose a\nsentence no lower than that mandated by Congress. See David A. Sklansky, Cocaine,\nRace, and Equal Protection, 47 Stan. L. Rev. 1283, 1316-18 (1995).\n\n       Feeney dealt with a state law that gave hiring preference in civil service positions\nto veterans. Because the overwhelming majority of veterans were male, the practical\neffect of the law was to deprive better qualified women of job opportunities. The Court\nfound that the plaintiff had not shown any purpose to discriminate against women.\nDiscriminatory purpose, it was held, “implies more than intent as volition or intent as\nawareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker, in this case a state\nlegislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because\nof,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (citation omitted). Feeney, however, makes it clear that racial\ndiscrimination, “regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively invalid and can be\nupheld only upon an extraordinary justification.” Id. at 272. There is overwhelming and\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582              United States v. Blewett, et al.                               Page 10\n\n\nunavoidable proof that the continued application of the old crack law keeps blacks in jail\nat a discriminatory rate. This proof supports an inference that the old crack laws have\nbeen maintained at least in part because of their discriminatory effects. The Supreme\nCourt in Dorsey,7 the legislative history of the Fair Sentencing Act, and the United\nStates Sentencing Commission in various special reports to Congress have all explicitly\nadvised that the old mandatory minimums are racially discriminatory. Obviously, this\ncourt should not place a meaning on the new statute and guidelines that would perpetuate\nproven racial discrimination and thereby violate equal protection. There is no excuse\nfor judges to engage in perpetuating such discrimination or to sanction it by refusing to\ncorrect it.\n\n         The role of the judge is especially important here. A host of precedents, from\n1880 forward, forbid judicial perpetuation of racial discrimination. In striking down the\nbehavior of a Virginia judge in refusing to call blacks as grand or petit jurors in 1878,\nthe Supreme Court denied the plea of the attorney general of Virginia to allow such\njudicial conduct. Relying on the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as an act of Congress\nprohibiting such discrimination, the court refused to permit this practice. “It is idle,” the\nCourt said, “to say that the act of Congress is unconstitutional because it inflicts\npenalties upon State judges for their judicial action.” Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339,\n348-49 (1880). Judges, both state and federal, must comply with the principles of equal\nprotection found in the Fourteenth Amendment. Likewise, in striking down racially\nrestrictive covenants judicially enforced by courts, the Supreme Court explained that\njudicial perpetuation of discrimination is not immunized from equal protection\nprinciples:\n\n         The difference between judicial enforcement and non-enforcement of the\n         restrictive covenants is the difference to petitioners between being denied\n         rights of property available to other members of the community and\n         being accorded full enjoyment of those rights on an equal footing\n\n\n\n         7\n          See 132 S. Ct. 2321, 2328 (2012) (stating that the new law was adopted “because the public had\ncome to understand sentences embodying the 100-to-1 ratio as reflecting unjustified race-based\ndifferences”).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582           United States v. Blewett, et al.                        Page 11\n\n\n        . . . . State action, as that phrase is understood for the purposes of the\n        Fourteenth Amendment, refers to exertions of state power in all forms.\n\nShelly v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1948). The Supreme Court has invalidated the\njudicial perpetuation of racial discrimination through the failure of courts to allow\ncustody awards of white children to mixed-race parents. See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S.\n429, 433 (1984) (“The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it\ntolerate them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot,\ndirectly or indirectly, give them effect.”). The entire body of school desegregation cases\ncondemning as discriminatory the perpetuation of racial segregation in the assignment\nof students or teachers leads us to the same conclusion about the judge’s role. See, e.g.,\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15–16 (1971) (“[A] school\ndesegregation case does not differ fundamentally from other cases involving the framing\nof equitable remedies to repair the denial of a constitutional right. The task is to correct,\nby a balancing of the individual and collective interests, the condition that offends the\nConstitution.”). In short, the principle that judges may not enforce obvious racial\ndiscrimination—and indeed, are duty-bound within their powers to ensure that it does\nnot occur—is time-honored in our law.\n\n        The remedy is straightforward and relatively simple. The Fair Sentencing Act\nand the new retroactive Sentencing Guidelines subsequently adopted by the Sentencing\nCommission can and should be interpreted to replace retroactively the old,\ndiscriminatory mandatory minimums with the new, more lenient minimums. It is our\nduty under the constitutional-doubt canon of statutory construction.             The Equal\nProtection Clause requires us to alter what Senator Leahy called “one of the most\nnotorious symbols of racial discrimination in the modern criminal justice system” and\nan “imbalance that . . . disparages the Constitution’s promise of equal treatment for all\nAmericans.” See supra, at 5 & n.5. In light of our new knowledge about the racial\ndiscrimination inherent in the old law, inertia and judicial instinct to avoid change and\nmaintain the status quo should no longer protect the old sentences. We should not allow\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582                United States v. Blewett, et al.                                  Page 12\n\n\nthe government’s legalisms to undermine the purpose of the Fair Sentencing Act and its\nmore lenient punishment system for crack cocaine.8\n\n                                                    III.\n\n         Laying aside the equal protection basis for revising the old mandatory\nminimums, the Sentencing Guidelines themselves call for such a construction.\n\n         The government, ignoring the equal protection violation, relies on a purely\ntechnical argument. The government provides no convincing reason why ordinary\nguideline sentences and “mandatory minimum” sentences should be treated differently.9\nThe government’s argument is that mandatory minimum sentences are “final” and\nshould not be disturbed or set aside under § 3582(c)(2), even though the Sentencing\nCommission has retroactively changed other crack sentences under the old 100-to-1\nratio. It claims that the Sentencing Commission itself has made a distinction between\nlong mandatory minimum sentences, which it wishes to retain, and other crack\nsentences.\n\n         The mechanism by which Congress sought to reduce crack cocaine sentences was\nsimply to reduce the excessive 100-to-1 ratio it had spelled out in earlier drug statutes,\na method recommended by the Sentencing Commission. The Supreme Court in Dorsey\nexplains the process:\n\n         In 2010, Congress accepted the Commission’s recommendations . . . and\n         enacted the Fair Sentencing Act into law. The Act increased the drug\n         amounts triggering mandatory minimums for crack trafficking offenses\n         from 5 grams to 28 grams in respect to the 5-year minimum and from\n\n         8\n           Other canons of statutory construction support retroactivity of the mandatory minimums as well.\nThe Fair Sentencing Act is clearly a remedial statute and should therefore be liberally construed. Chisholm\nv. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 476 (1793) (Jay, C.J.). Further, if there is a doubt under the interlocking\ntexts of the statutory and guideline provisions or under the application notes or any amendment to the\nguidelines, the rule of lenity should apply. Under that rule, ambiguity should be resolved in the\ndefendant’s favor. See United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 47-54 (1994); Williams v. United States,\n458 U.S. 279, 290 (1982); Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980).\n         9\n            Mandatory minimum sentences generally remain widely criticized by the criminal justice\nliterature, the federal judiciary, and the Sentencing Commission. The Commission identified mandatory\nminimums for drug offenses and the corresponding guidelines as “a primary cause of a widening gap\nbetween the average sentences of Black, White, and Hispanic offenders” in the guidelines era. United\nStates Sent’g Comm’n, Fifteen Years of Guidelines Sentencing (2004).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582              United States v. Blewett, et al.                         Page 13\n\n\n       50 grams to 280 grams in respect to the 10-year minimum (while leaving\n       powder at 500 grams and 5,000 grams respectively). The change had the\n       effect of lowering the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio to 18-to-1.\n\n132 S. Ct. at 2329 (citations omitted). The Sentencing Commission incorporated and\nintegrated the new statutory minimums into its system by attempting to harmonize the\nnew crack guidelines with the new mandatory minimums.\n\n       The government argues that the Fair Sentencing Act did not give retroactive\neffect to the old mandatory minimums like those imposed on the Blewetts because a\nmandatory minimum does not fit the language—“sentencing range that has subsequently\nbeen lowered by the Sentencing Commission”—used by Section 3582(c)(2). The\ngovernment ignores the fact, however, that the guidelines range is entirely dependent on,\nnot independent of, a statutory mandatory minimum or maximum. The mandatory\nminimums and maximums are an integral part of and gave rise to the sentencing\nguideline ranges. They are the most significant part because they provide the bookends:\nThe mandatory minimum provides the floor of the range and the mandatory maximum\nprovides the ceiling if a certain threshold quantity of crack is involved. The Sentencing\nCommission itself instructs judges to use the mandatory minimums in this manner. See\n§ 5G1.1(b) (“the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline\nsentence”).10 For example, if a defendant’s guideline range is 50-70 months with a\nstatutory mandatory minimum of 60 months, the floor of the guideline range then\nelevates to 60 and the resulting guideline range is 60-70 months. The entire system of\nrevised crack guidelines is therefore driven by the new mandatory minimums.\n\n       The Commission uses the new statutory minimums as the gravitational force\naround which the new system revolves. The statutory minimums are closely integrated\ninto the structure of the revised guidelines. When the entire retroactive guideline process\nis based on the new congressional minimums, it makes no sense for the government to\n\n       10\n            § 5G1.1(b) provides:\n       (b)        Where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the\n                  maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required\n                  minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence. (Emphasis\n                  added.)\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582               United States v. Blewett, et al.                    Page 14\n\n\nargue that prisoners sentenced under the old crack guidelines should have their ordinary\nguideline sentences revised sharply downward retroactively to reflect the 18-to-1 ratio\nwhile leaving the prisoners sentenced under the old, now-repealed, statutory minimums\nlanguishing in prison under the 100-to-1 ratio. The new minimums ordered by the Fair\nSentencing Act to be incorporated by the guidelines are no longer “statutory” only.\nThey are just as much a part of the retroactive guidelines as other guidelines because\nthey have been incorporated in the retroactive system. As the Third Circuit has\nobserved, a contrary result “would not make sense” because the old minimums would\n“always trump the new Guidelines for the large number of defendants whose Guidelines\nranges are [now] below the mandatory minimum,” as in this case. United States v.\nDixon, 648 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2011) (defendant’s offense committed prior to the\nAct, but sentenced after passage of the Act). Consistent policy requires that the new\nstatutory minimums also be given retroactive effect.\n\n        The government’s argument leads to the absurd result that the Blewetts would\nremain in prison for ten years when under the revised guidelines they are now subject\nto no minimum at all. Also absurd, the government’s view of retroactivity would give\nmajor kingpins the greatest benefit of retroactivity because their amended guideline\nrange is above the mandatory minimum while hundreds of more petty, less culpable\noffenders like the Blewetts remain in prison without any benefit of the revised law. This\nresult perpetuates racial discrimination, defies the goal of consistency, creates a huge\nsentencing disparity in violation of the purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\nand does not eliminate the unfairness that Congress had in mind and that Dorsey points\nout as the reason the new guidelines are given retroactive treatment.\n\n       Further, section 3582(c)(2) on retroactivity dovetails with § 1B1.10 of the\nguidelines, which is called a “policy statement” covering “Reduction in Term of\nImprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline Range.”11 The government argues\n\n\n       11\n            This entire guideline provides as follows:\n                  §1B1.10. Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline\n                  Range (Policy Statement)\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582             United States v. Blewett, et al.                                Page 15\n\n\nagainst providing redress by pointing not to the language of this guideline provision but\nto an “Application Note” on “Eligibility.” The government makes this argument in the\nface of the fact that the Sentencing Commission itself pointed out to Congress the racial\ndiscrimination that led to the change in the law. The meaning of the Application Note\nis ambiguous:\n\n\n       (a) Authority. –\n       (1) In General. – In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the\n       guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an\n       amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the\n       defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18\n       U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment shall be consistent\n       with this policy statement.\n       (2) Exclusions. – A reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment is not consistent with this\n       policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) if –\n\n       (A) None of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant; or\n       (B) An amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant's\n       applicable guideline range.\n       (3) Limitation. – Consistent with subsection (b), proceedings under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this\n       policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.\n\n       (b) Determination of Reduction in Term of Imprisonment.–\n       (1) In General. – In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant's term\n       of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court\n       shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\n       if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) had been in effect at the time the\n       defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, the court shall substitute only the\n       amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied\n       when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions\n       unaffected.\n       (2) Limitation and Prohibition on Extent of Reduction.–\n       (A) Limitation. – Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the\n       defendant's term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term\n       that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of\n       this subsection.\n       (B) Exception for Substantial Assistance. – If the term of imprisonment imposed was less than\n       the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time\n       of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance\n       to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under\n       subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.\n       (C) Prohibition. – In no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of\n       imprisonment the defendant has already served.\n       (c) Covered Amendments.—Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in\n       Appendix C as follows: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341, 371, 379, 380, 433,454, 461, 484, 488,\n       490, 499, 505, 506, 516, 591, 599, 606, 657, 702, 706 as amended by 711, 715, and 750 (parts\n       A and C only).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.

Accordingly, a reduction in\n               defendant’s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18\n               U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy\n               statement if: (i) none of the amendments listed in subsection (c)\n               is applicable to the defendant; or (ii) an amendment listed in\n               subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant but the amendment\n               does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable\n               guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or\n               statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of\n               imprisonment).\n\n(Emphasis added.) The government argues that the old statutory minimums still\n“operate” as “another guideline or statutory provision” to prevent the lowering of the\n“applicable guideline range,” even though these minimums have been repealed and the\nnew minimums have been incorporated into the Commission’s new crack guidelines.\nWhy does the parenthetical phrase at the end of the Note — “e.g., a statutory mandatory\nminimum term of imprisonment” — refer to the old, discriminatory minimums instead\nof the new, more lenient ones that presumably are not racially discriminatory? The\nstatutory minimums have been reduced and incorporated into the guidelines by the\nSentencing Commission. The old, repealed discriminatory minimums are no longer a\npart “of the operation of” the sentencing system. They should not be used to foreclose\n“lowering the defendant’s applicable guideline range.” We should not presume that the\nSentencing Commission would point out to Congress the racially discriminatory nature\nof the old crack guidelines, and request new mandatory minimums around which to\nrebuild the new retroactive guidelines, and then decide to retain the old crack minimums\nas the “guideline sentence” under §5G1.1(b).\n\n                                    IV. Conclusion\n\n       The old crack cocaine statutory minimums are racially discriminatory as the\nlegislative history of the Fair Sentencing Act makes clear, as the Dorsey case states, and\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v.

Perpetuation of such racially\ndiscriminatory sentences by federal courts is unconstitutional and therefore the\nsentencing guidelines must be interpreted to eliminate such a result.

I fear that my panel\ncolleagues have sua sponte set sail into the constitutional sea of equal protection without\nany legal ballast to keep their analysis afloat. To start with, they “readily acknowledge\nthat no party challenges the constitutionality of denying retroactive application of the\nFair Sentencing Act to people who were sentenced under the old regime.” Maj. Op. 6.\nOpining on this unbriefed and unargued issue is thus fraught with the likelihood of\nrunning aground on the shoals of uncharted territory.\n\n        They further concede that the law establishing the 100-to-1 ratio between powder\ncocaine and crack cocaine for sentencing purposes was constitutional when enacted:\n\n        When the old 100-to-1 crack cocaine statute was adopted, it presumably\n        did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there was no intent\n        or design to discriminate on a racial basis. Its adoption was simply a\n        mistake.\n\nMaj. Op. 8.\n\n        So far, so good. But then the majority veers off into the abyss with the following\nanalysis:\n\n        Since 1986, however, we have gained knowledge of the old statute’s\n        devastating effect on blacks. . . . The discriminatory nature of the old\n        sentencing regime is so obvious that it cannot seriously be argued that\n        race does not play a role in the failure to retroactively apply the Fair\n        Sentencing Act. A “disparate impact” case now becomes an intentional\n        subjugation or discriminatory purpose case. Like slavery and Jim Crow\n        laws, the intentional maintenance of discriminatory sentences is a denial\n        of equal protection.\n\nId. at 8-9.\n\n        The majority reaches this conclusion without citing a single case in support. This\nis not due to a lack of diligent research; it is due to the lack of any such cases. The best\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 19\n\n\nthe majority can do is try to distinguish two Supreme Court decisions (McCleskey v.\nKemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987), and Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney,\n442 U.S. 256 (1979)) that even the majority concedes “on first glance might appear to\nsanction the discrimination at issue here.” Maj. Op. 9. Those efforts at distinguishing\nMcCleskey and Feeney are in vain, however, because binding Sixth Circuit precedent has\nalready foreclosed the majority’s constitutional argument.\n\n       The majority reaches the issue of equal protection not directly, but through\napplying the “constitutional-doubt canon” of statutory construction (also known as\n“constitutional avoidance,” see Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 384 (2005)). Maj. Op.\n6. Two conditions are necessary before a court may invoke this interpretative canon:\n(1) the statute in question must be “susceptible of two constructions,” and (2) one\nconstruction raises “grave and doubtful constitutional questions” that the other\nconstruction avoids. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The present case meets\nneither condition.\n\n       I start with the first condition. This court has already interpreted the Fair\nSentencing Act as applied to dozens of defendants who, like the Blewetts, were\nconvicted and sentenced prior to the effective date of the Act. See, e.g., United States\nv. Hammond, — F.3d —, No. 12-5522, 2013 WL 1363908 (6th Cir. Apr. 5, 2013);\nUnited States v. Hollins, No. 12-5182, 2012 WL 5477119 (6th Cir. Nov. 13, 2012);\nUnited States v. Downs, 487 F. App’x 286 (6th Cir. 2012). In each of these decisions,\nthis court has held that the Act is not retroactive to defendants who were convicted and\nsentenced before its effective date.\n\n       The majority therefore errs in employing the constitutional-avoidance canon to\nselect a construction of the Act that is favorable to the Blewetts when this court has\nalready chosen the contrary construction. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 385 (“The canon of\nconstitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary\ntextual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and\nthe canon functions as a means of choosing between them.” (emphasis in original)). We\nare instead bound by Hammond, a prior reported decision that interprets the same statute\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 20\n\n\nunder the same factual circumstances as the present case. See, e.g., Salmi v. Sec’y of\nHealth & Human Servs., 774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1985) (“A panel of this Court\ncannot overrule the decision of another panel. The prior decision remains controlling\nauthority unless an inconsistent decision of the United States Supreme Court requires\nmodification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       And even if Hammond were not fatal to the cause taken up by my colleagues,\ntheir resort to the constitutional-avoidance canon would still be flawed because this court\nhas already answered any “grave and doubtful constitutional questions” raised by the\ncontinued application of the old crack-cocaine/powder-cocaine sentencing disparity.\nOver 20 years ago, this court held that “the one to one hundred ratio of crack to cocaine\ndoes not violate Equal Protection Standards.” United States v. Williams, 962 F.2d 1218,\n1227 (6th Cir. 1992).\n\n       Subsequent equal protection attacks on the crack/powder ratio have likewise been\nrejected. See, e.g., United States v. Reece, 994 F.2d 277, 278 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding\nthat the ratio’s disparate impact “may not alone support a finding of invidious\ndiscrimination in a facially neutral law”); United States v. Muse, 250 F. App’x 700, 701-\n02 (6th Cir. 2007) (noting that the Sixth Circuit has already rejected equal protection\narguments for invalidating the 100-to-1 ratio and that “[e]very court of appeals to\naddress the issue has upheld the ratio in the face of similar constitutional challenges”).\nJust as Hammond resolves any doubt of statutory interpretation regarding the limited\nretroactivity of the Fair Sentencing Act, so do Reece and Williams resolve any doubt\nregarding the constitutionality of pre-Act sentences that the Act leaves intact. Moreover,\nknowledge of the ratio’s disparate racial impact—which is the majority’s rationale for\ndistinguishing the constitutional validity of the ratio’s initial enactment from the\nconstitutional invalidity of its continued enforcement—was recognized and rejected as\nthe basis of the equal protection challenge in Reece. See 994 F.2d at 278 (noting the\ndefendant’s use of statistics to show a disparate racial impact, but holding that evidence\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 21\n\n\nof such impact was insufficient because “only purposeful discrimination merits strict\nscrutiny”).\n\n       Another point bears mentioning. The majority’s basic premise is that the\ncontinued enforcement of a sentencing regime that equates one gram of crack cocaine\nto one hundred grams of powder cocaine violates the Equal Protection Clause because\nit has a known disparate racial impact. Yet the majority apparently has no problem with\nthe Fair Sentencing Act’s reduction of that disparity to an 18-to-1 ratio. Why, however,\nis a 100-to-1 ratio—but not an 18-to-1 ratio—an equal protection violation? In my\nopinion, the lack of any constitutionally relevant distinction between the old ratio and\nthe new ratio further undermines the majority’s equal protection rationale.\n\n       Having addressed the shortcomings of the majority’s sua sponte constitutional\nargument, I turn now to the argument that the Blewetts actually presented: i.e., that the\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of the Fair Sentencing Act in Dorsey v. United States,\n132 S. Ct. 2321 (2012), makes the Act fully retroactive as applied to defendants seeking\nmodification of a mandatory-minimum sentence in a proceeding under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3582(c)(2). As noted above, however, the Hammond decision has already rejected the\nBlewetts’ proposed reading of the Fair Sentencing Act, and it did so “in light of Dorsey.”\nHammond, 2013 WL 1363908, at *2. My colleagues in the majority, moreover, have\npreviously joined in unpublished decisions that reached the same conclusion as set forth\nin Hammond. See United States v. Mundy, 486 F. App’x 598, 598-99 (6th Cir. 2012)\n(per curiam decision joined by Judge Martin); United States v. Stanley, No. 11-4423,\n2012 WL 4014932, at *3 (6th Cir. Sept. 12, 2012) (opinion joined by Judge Merritt).\nIn short, Hammond is the law of this circuit and cannot be overturned by this panel.\n\n       But even if we were to approach this issue with no prior circuit precedent to bind\nus, the Blewetts’ argument would fail because 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) allows a court to\nmodify a term of imprisonment that has already been imposed only if two conditions are\nmet:   (1)    the defendant’s sentence was based on a sentencing range that has\nsubsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, and (2) a reduction in the\ndefendant’s sentence would be consistent with the so-called “policy statement” found\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582         United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 22\n\n\nat U.S. Sentencing Guidelines § 1B1.10. The Blewetts, however, were sentenced under\na mandatory-minimum statute that was subsequently amended by Congress, not a\n“sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.”\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) (emphases added).\n\n       In an effort to satisfy the first condition of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), the majority\nnotes that “[t]he statutory minimums are closely integrated into the structure of the\nrevised guidelines.” Maj. Op. 13-14. But why this close integration precludes Congress\nfrom treating the two sentencing schemes differently is unexplained. See Hammond,\n2013 WL 1363908, at *2 (holding that the defendant’s mandatory-minimum sentence\n“has not subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission” and therefore could\nnot qualify for a modification under § 3582(c)(2) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       The Blewetts fare no better under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)’s second condition\nbecause only those amendments to the Guidelines included in USSG § 1B1.10(c) may\ntrigger eligibility for a sentence modification under § 3582(c)(2). USSG § 1B1.10, cmt.\nn.1(A) (2012). Guideline § 1B1.10(c) incorporates Amendment 750 (parts A and C\nonly), which implemented certain aspects of the Fair Sentencing Act. Part A amended\nthe Drug Quantity Table found in USSG § 2D1.1 that is used to calculate sentencing\nranges, while part C eliminated the reference in USSG § 2D2.1 to a five-year mandatory-\nminimum sentence for simple possession of more than five grams of crack cocaine.\n\n       In contrast, the Blewetts asked the district court for a sentence modification\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) based on the Fair Sentencing Act’s amendment of 21\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1), the latter providing the mandatory-minimum sentences for drug-\ntrafficking offenses. But neither part A nor part C of Amendment 750 includes the\nchanges made to § 841(b)(1). Because the Blewetts seek the benefit of a statutory\namendment that was not incorporated into USSG § 1B1.10, they are ineligible for a\nmodification of their sentences. See Hammond, 2013 WL 1363908, at *2 (holding that\nthe district court did not have authority to reduce a defendant’s sentence under\n§ 3582(c)(2) because the defendant’s mandatory-minimum sentence “was not an\namendment incorporated into the Sentencing Commission’s policy statement”).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 23\n\n\n       The Dorsey decision strongly supports the proposition that the Fair Sentencing\nAct’s amendment of a statutory mandatory-minimum sentence provides no relief to\ndefendants seeking modification of a sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) because\nchanges in criminal penalties generally apply to defendants not yet sentenced, but do not\napply to defendants already sentenced. See Dorsey, 132 S. Ct. at 2335. A proceeding\nunder § 3582(c)(2) is a modification of a previously imposed sentence and is not itself\na sentencing or resentencing. Dillon v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 2690 (2010) (“By\nits terms, § 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentencing proceeding.”).\nThe Fair Sentencing Act therefore applies to not-yet-sentenced defendants such as those\nin Dorsey, but does not apply to already-sentenced defendants, such as the Blewetts, who\nseek § 3582(c)(2) modifications. See Dorsey, 132 S.Ct. at 2335 (distinguishing the\ninitial imposition of a sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3553 from the modification of a\nsentence under § 3582(c) and recognizing that disparities “will exist whenever Congress\nenacts a new law changing sentences,” but concluding that the disparity created by the\nCourt’s decision reflects “the ordinary practice” in federal sentencing); see also\nHammond, 2013 WL 1363908, at *2 (noting that “Dorsey itself disfavors [retroactive\napplication of the Fair Sentencing Act] in the context of § 3582”).\n\n       Finally, the majority contends that “it cannot seriously be argued that race does\nnot play a role in the failure to retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act.” Maj. Op.\n8. To the contrary, the failure to retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act is solely\ndue to a faithful interpretation of the statutory scheme and a recognition of the rule of\nstare decisis. Congress is of course free to amend the Fair Sentencing Act to make it\nfully retroactive, but that is a legislative prerogative and not appropriate for this court\nto do simply by decree.\n\n       For all of the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

This is a crack cocaine case brought by two currently\nincarcerated defendants seeking retroactive relief from racially discriminatory mandatory\nminimum sentences imposed on them in 2005. The Fair Sentencing Act was passed in\nAugust 2010 to “restore fairness to Federal cocaine sentencing” laws that had unfairly\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582            United States v. Blewett, et al.                        Page 2\n\n\nimpacted blacks for almost 25 years. The Fair Sentencing Act repealed portions of the\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that instituted a 100-to-1 ratio between crack and powder\ncocaine, treating one gram of crack as equivalent to 100 grams of powder cocaine for\nsentencing purposes. The 100-to-1 ratio had long been acknowledged by many in the\nlegal system to be unjustified and adopted without empirical support. The Fair\nSentencing Act lowered the ratio to a more lenient 18-to-1 ratio. However, thousands\nof inmates, most black, languish in prison under the old, discredited ratio because the\nFair Sentencing Act was not made explicitly retroactive by Congress.\n\n          In this case, we hold, inter alia, that the federal judicial perpetuation of the\nracially discriminatory mandatory minimum crack sentences for those defendants\nsentenced under the old crack sentencing law, as the government advocates, would\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause, as incorporated into the Fifth Amendment by the\ndoctrine of Bolling v. Sharpe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954) (Fifth Amendment forbids federal\nracial discrimination in the same way as the Fourteenth Amendment forbids state racial\ndiscrimination). As Professor William J. Stuntz, the late Harvard criminal law professor,\nhas observed, “persistent bias occurred with respect to the contemporary enforcement\nof drug laws where, in the 1990s and early 2000s, blacks constituted a minority of\nregular users of crack cocaine but more than 80 percent of crack defendants.” The\nCollapse of American Criminal Justice 184 (2011). He recommended that we “redress\nthat discrimination” with “the underused concept of ‘equal protection of the laws.’” Id.\nat 297.\n\n          In this opinion, we will set out both the constitutional and statutory reasons the\nold, racially discriminatory crack sentencing law must now be set aside in favor of the\nnew sentencing law enacted by Congress as the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. The Act\nshould apply to all defendants, including those sentenced prior to its passage. We\ntherefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for resentencing.\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582                 United States v. Blewett, et al.                                      Page 3\n\n\n                                                     I.\n\n         The district court judge, bound by unavoidable mandatory minimums, sentenced\nthe Blewett1 cousins in 2005 to a mandatory minimum of ten years each under the old\n100-to-1 crack cocaine law, sentences based on the quantity of crack cocaine possessed.\nThe Blewetts seek retroactive resentencing under 18 U.S.C § 3582(c)(2)2 and 28 U.S.C.\n§ 994(u)3 because the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, P.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372,\nas implemented by new sentencing guidelines, has substantially reduced crack cocaine\nsentences, including the mandatory minimum sentences imposed in this case. See\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b) (increasing the amount of crack from 50 grams to 280 grams to\ntrigger the 10-year mandatory minimum and from 5 grams to 28 grams to trigger the\nfive-year mandatory minimum). If the Blewetts were sentenced today under the revised\ncrack law, they would not be subject to a statutory minimum because the quantity of\ncrack involved falls below the threshold for any statutory minimum.\n\n         The old 100-to-1 crack cocaine ratio has led to the mass incarceration of\nthousands of nonviolent prisoners under a law widely acknowledged as racially\ndiscriminatory. There were approximately 30,000 federal prisoners (about 15 percent\nof all federal prisoners) serving crack cocaine sentences in 2011.

More than 80 percent of federal prisoners serving crack cocaine\nsentences are black.

Rec. S1683 (daily ed.\nMar. 17, 2010). Many members of Congress stated that the old law should be changed\nbecause it was racially discriminatory and not based on any coherent rationale.5\n\n\n        4\n          All the Sentencing Commission publications cited herein are available on the Commission’s\nwebsite (www.ussc.gov).\n        5\n           Here is a representative sample of statements by members of Congress concerning the purpose\nof the Fair Sentencing Act:\n        155 Cong. Rec. S10491 (daily ed. Oct. 15, 2009) (statement of Sen. Dick Durbin,\n        Assistant Senate Majority Leader) (“Vice President Joe Biden, one of the authors of the\n        legislation creating this disparity in sentencing, has said: ‘Each of the myths upon\n        which we based the disparity has since been dispelled or altered.’”); 156 Cong. Rec.\n        H6202 (daily ed. July 28, 2010) (statement of Rep.

The majority of these\npeople, the government claims, cannot benefit from the new law because they received\na sentence under the old mandatory minimums or received a career offender designation\n(requiring two previous drug convictions). So according to figures supplied by the\nSentencing Commission, less than one-half of those given excessive, racially\ndiscriminatory sentences, like the ones imposed on the Blewetts, are eligible for relief.\nUnited States Sent’g Comm’n, Analysis of the Impact of Guideline Implementation of\nthe Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 if the Amendment Were Applied Retroactively, at 12\n(May 2011).\n\n       Congress, as Justice Breyer’s opinion in Dorsey confirmed, intended in the Fair\nSentencing Act to repeal and redress the wrongs of the older crack sentencing statute that\nCongress believed had proven itself to be arbitrary, irrational, and racially\ndiscriminatory. The status quo has now been overturned. The question remaining is:\nhow retroactive is the new law? Fully? Or only partially, just covering a minority of\nthose wrongly sentenced?\n\n       The answer to the question turns on our interpretation of principles of equal\nprotection and several interlocking rules, provisions of sentencing law, including\nbackground canons of statutory interpretation, the Fair Sentencing Act, the previous\nstatutes it repealed or modified, and the sentencing guideline provisions propagated\npursuant to it.

These alarming numbers are not unlike the Supreme Court’s\nearly cases of facially neutral laws creating an overwhelmingly disparate result. See Yick\nWo v.

In a 1995 report to Congress, the Sentencing Commission said,\n“The 100-to-1 crack cocaine to powder cocaine quantity ratio is a primary cause of the\ngrowing disparity between sentences for Black and White federal defendants.” United\nStates Sent’g Comm’n, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing\nPolicy, at Chapter 7D (Feb. 1995). In 1995, the Commission submitted to Congress an\namendment to the sentencing guidelines that would have equalized penalties between\ncrack and powder cocaine. Congress rejected the recommendation. In 1997, the\nCommission unanimously recommended that Congress lower the 100-to 1 ratio and gave\nCongress several options to adjust the disparity between crack and powder cocaine\npenalties. See United States Sent’g Comm’n, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine\nand Federal Sentencing Policy (Apr. 1997).            Congress took no action on the\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                          Page 8\n\n\nrecommendations.       In 2002, the Commission again “unanimously and firmly”\nrecommended to Congress that the drug quantity ratio between crack and powder\ncocaine be reduced. United States Sent’g Comm’n, Report to the Congress: Cocaine and\nFederal Sentencing Policy viii (May 2002). While the Sentencing Commission adjusted\nthe guideline ranges for crack cocaine in 2007 in Amendment 706 to decrease the length\nof sentences, Congress made no changes to the 100-to-1 ratio to adjust the mandatory\nminimums for crack cocaine until it passed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010. Hence\nthousands of black defendants now remain in federal prisons under long sentences, some\nfor life.\n\n        In view of the statistical facts and the widespread congressional consensus\nleading to the adoption of the Fair Sentencing Act’s remedial provisions, there can be\nno doubt that the old crack law was racially discriminatory in effect. As a matter of legal\ndoctrine, there is no equal protection violation without discriminatory intent. See\nWashington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976). When the old 100-to-1 crack cocaine statute\nwas adopted, it presumably did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there\nwas no intent or design to discriminate on a racial basis. Its adoption was simply a\nmistake.    Since 1986, however, we have gained knowledge of the old statute’s\ndevastating effect on blacks. Congress itself acknowledged this problem by enacting the\nFair Sentencing Act.\n\n        The Fair Sentencing Act was a step forward, but it did not finish the job. The\nracial discrimination continues by virtue of a web of statutes, sentencing guidelines, and\ncourt cases that maintain the harsh provisions for those defendants sentenced before the\nFair Sentencing Act. If we continue now with a construction of the statute that\nperpetuates the discrimination, there is no longer any defense that the discrimination is\nunintentional. The discriminatory nature of the old sentencing regime is so obvious that\nit cannot seriously be argued that race does not play a role in the failure to retroactively\napply the Fair Sentencing Act. A “disparate impact” case now becomes an intentional\nsubjugation or discriminatory purpose case. Like slavery and Jim Crow laws, the\nintentional maintenance of discriminatory sentences is a denial of equal protection.\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v.

In\nMcCleskey, the Supreme Court held that a detailed study showing racial disparity in the\napplication of Georgia’s death penalty could not make out intentional discrimination.\nStatistical proof of discriminatory application was not enough; McCleskey was required\nto “prove that the Georgia Legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty statute\nbecause of an anticipated racially discriminatory effect.” McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 298.\nHere Congress enacted the new law to remedy racial discrimination. McCleskey’s\ndisapproval of statistical evidence is also distinguishable. McCleskey was obviously\nconcerned to preserve a system of criminal enforcement where multiple decisionmakers\nwere involved and where each decision to impose the death penalty required assessment\nof the individual defendant’s unique personal, mitigating characteristics. See id. at\n292–97. But in the context of crack cocaine sentencing, the defendant’s independent\ncharacteristics do not factor into the equation, and the decisionmaker’s choice is a\ndiscretionless mandatory minimum. In the general course of things, the prosecutor will\ncharge based on an objectively verifiable quantity of crack, and the court will impose a\nsentence no lower than that mandated by Congress. See David A. Sklansky, Cocaine,\nRace, and Equal Protection, 47 Stan. L. Rev. 1283, 1316-18 (1995).\n\n       Feeney dealt with a state law that gave hiring preference in civil service positions\nto veterans. Because the overwhelming majority of veterans were male, the practical\neffect of the law was to deprive better qualified women of job opportunities. The Court\nfound that the plaintiff had not shown any purpose to discriminate against women.\nDiscriminatory purpose, it was held, “implies more than intent as volition or intent as\nawareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker, in this case a state\nlegislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because\nof,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (citation omitted). Feeney, however, makes it clear that racial\ndiscrimination, “regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively invalid and can be\nupheld only upon an extraordinary justification.” Id. at 272. There is overwhelming and\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582              United States v. Blewett, et al.                               Page 10\n\n\nunavoidable proof that the continued application of the old crack law keeps blacks in jail\nat a discriminatory rate. This proof supports an inference that the old crack laws have\nbeen maintained at least in part because of their discriminatory effects. The Supreme\nCourt in Dorsey,7 the legislative history of the Fair Sentencing Act, and the United\nStates Sentencing Commission in various special reports to Congress have all explicitly\nadvised that the old mandatory minimums are racially discriminatory. Obviously, this\ncourt should not place a meaning on the new statute and guidelines that would perpetuate\nproven racial discrimination and thereby violate equal protection. There is no excuse\nfor judges to engage in perpetuating such discrimination or to sanction it by refusing to\ncorrect it.\n\n         The role of the judge is especially important here. A host of precedents, from\n1880 forward, forbid judicial perpetuation of racial discrimination. In striking down the\nbehavior of a Virginia judge in refusing to call blacks as grand or petit jurors in 1878,\nthe Supreme Court denied the plea of the attorney general of Virginia to allow such\njudicial conduct. Relying on the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as an act of Congress\nprohibiting such discrimination, the court refused to permit this practice. “It is idle,” the\nCourt said, “to say that the act of Congress is unconstitutional because it inflicts\npenalties upon State judges for their judicial action.” Ex parte Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90041\"><a href=\"/opinion/90041/ex-parte-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n348-49 (1880). Judges, both state and federal, must comply with the principles of equal\nprotection found in the Fourteenth Amendment. Likewise, in striking down racially\nrestrictive covenants judicially enforced by courts, the Supreme Court explained that\njudicial perpetuation of discrimination is not immunized from equal protection\nprinciples:\n\n         The difference between judicial enforcement and non-enforcement of the\n         restrictive covenants is the difference to petitioners between being denied\n         rights of property available to other members of the community and\n         being accorded full enjoyment of those rights on an equal footing\n\n\n\n         7\n          See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"802791\"><a href=\"/opinion/802791/dorsey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The entire body of school desegregation cases\ncondemning as discriminatory the perpetuation of racial segregation in the assignment\nof students or teachers leads us to the same conclusion about the judge’s role. See, e.g.,\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15–16 (1971) (“[A] school\ndesegregation case does not differ fundamentally from other cases involving the framing\nof equitable remedies to repair the denial of a constitutional right.

In short, the principle that judges may not enforce obvious racial\ndiscrimination—and indeed, are duty-bound within their powers to ensure that it does\nnot occur—is time-honored in our law.\n\n        The remedy is straightforward and relatively simple. The Fair Sentencing Act\nand the new retroactive Sentencing Guidelines subsequently adopted by the Sentencing\nCommission can and should be interpreted to replace retroactively the old,\ndiscriminatory mandatory minimums with the new, more lenient minimums. It is our\nduty under the constitutional-doubt canon of statutory construction.             The Equal\nProtection Clause requires us to alter what Senator Leahy called “one of the most\nnotorious symbols of racial discrimination in the modern criminal justice system” and\nan “imbalance that . . . disparages the Constitution’s promise of equal treatment for all\nAmericans.” See supra, at 5 & n.5. In light of our new knowledge about the racial\ndiscrimination inherent in the old law, inertia and judicial instinct to avoid change and\nmaintain the status quo should no longer protect the old sentences.

The government provides no convincing reason why ordinary\nguideline sentences and “mandatory minimum” sentences should be treated differently.9\nThe government’s argument is that mandatory minimum sentences are “final” and\nshould not be disturbed or set aside under § 3582(c)(2), even though the Sentencing\nCommission has retroactively changed other crack sentences under the old 100-to-1\nratio. It claims that the Sentencing Commission itself has made a distinction between\nlong mandatory minimum sentences, which it wishes to retain, and other crack\nsentences.\n\n         The mechanism by which Congress sought to reduce crack cocaine sentences was\nsimply to reduce the excessive 100-to-1 ratio it had spelled out in earlier drug statutes,\na method recommended by the Sentencing Commission. The Supreme Court in Dorsey\nexplains the process:\n\n         In 2010, Congress accepted the Commission’s recommendations . . . and\n         enacted the Fair Sentencing Act into law. The Act increased the drug\n         amounts triggering mandatory minimums for crack trafficking offenses\n         from 5 grams to 28 grams in respect to the 5-year minimum and from\n\n         8\n           Other canons of statutory construction support retroactivity of the mandatory minimums as well.\nThe Fair Sentencing Act is clearly a remedial statute and should therefore be liberally construed. Chisholm\nv. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 476 (1793) (Jay, C.J.). Further, if there is a doubt under the interlocking\ntexts of the statutory and guideline provisions or under the application notes or any amendment to the\nguidelines, the rule of lenity should apply. Under that rule, ambiguity should be resolved in the\ndefendant’s favor. See United States v.

The Commission identified mandatory\nminimums for drug offenses and the corresponding guidelines as “a primary cause of a widening gap\nbetween the average sentences of Black, White, and Hispanic offenders” in the guidelines era. United\nStates Sent’g Comm’n, Fifteen Years of Guidelines Sentencing (2004).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582              United States v. Blewett, et al.

The change had the\n       effect of lowering the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio to 18-to-1.\n\n132 S. Ct. at 2329 (citations omitted). The Sentencing Commission incorporated and\nintegrated the new statutory minimums into its system by attempting to harmonize the\nnew crack guidelines with the new mandatory minimums.\n\n       The government argues that the Fair Sentencing Act did not give retroactive\neffect to the old mandatory minimums like those imposed on the Blewetts because a\nmandatory minimum does not fit the language—“sentencing range that has subsequently\nbeen lowered by the Sentencing Commission”—used by Section 3582(c)(2). The\ngovernment ignores the fact, however, that the guidelines range is entirely dependent on,\nnot independent of, a statutory mandatory minimum or maximum. The mandatory\nminimums and maximums are an integral part of and gave rise to the sentencing\nguideline ranges. They are the most significant part because they provide the bookends:\nThe mandatory minimum provides the floor of the range and the mandatory maximum\nprovides the ceiling if a certain threshold quantity of crack is involved. The Sentencing\nCommission itself instructs judges to use the mandatory minimums in this manner. See\n§ 5G1.1(b) (“the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline\nsentence”).10 For example, if a defendant’s guideline range is 50-70 months with a\nstatutory mandatory minimum of 60 months, the floor of the guideline range then\nelevates to 60 and the resulting guideline range is 60-70 months. The entire system of\nrevised crack guidelines is therefore driven by the new mandatory minimums.\n\n       The Commission uses the new statutory minimums as the gravitational force\naround which the new system revolves. The statutory minimums are closely integrated\ninto the structure of the revised guidelines. When the entire retroactive guideline process\nis based on the new congressional minimums, it makes no sense for the government to\n\n       10\n            § 5G1.1(b) provides:\n       (b)        Where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the\n                  maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required\n                  minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.

The new minimums ordered by the Fair\nSentencing Act to be incorporated by the guidelines are no longer “statutory” only.\nThey are just as much a part of the retroactive guidelines as other guidelines because\nthey have been incorporated in the retroactive system. As the Third Circuit has\nobserved, a contrary result “would not make sense” because the old minimums would\n“always trump the new Guidelines for the large number of defendants whose Guidelines\nranges are [now] below the mandatory minimum,” as in this case.

Also absurd, the government’s view of retroactivity would give\nmajor kingpins the greatest benefit of retroactivity because their amended guideline\nrange is above the mandatory minimum while hundreds of more petty, less culpable\noffenders like the Blewetts remain in prison without any benefit of the revised law. This\nresult perpetuates racial discrimination, defies the goal of consistency, creates a huge\nsentencing disparity in violation of the purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\nand does not eliminate the unfairness that Congress had in mind and that Dorsey points\nout as the reason the new guidelines are given retroactive treatment.\n\n       Further, section 3582(c)(2) on retroactivity dovetails with § 1B1.10 of the\nguidelines, which is called a “policy statement” covering “Reduction in Term of\nImprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline Range.”11 The government argues\n\n\n       11\n            This entire guideline provides as follows:\n                  §1B1.10. Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline\n                  Range (Policy Statement)\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582             United States v. Blewett, et al.                                Page 15\n\n\nagainst providing redress by pointing not to the language of this guideline provision but\nto an “Application Note” on “Eligibility.” The government makes this argument in the\nface of the fact that the Sentencing Commission itself pointed out to Congress the racial\ndiscrimination that led to the change in the law. The meaning of the Application Note\nis ambiguous:\n\n\n       (a) Authority. –\n       (1) In General. – In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the\n       guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an\n       amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the\n       defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18\n       U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment shall be consistent\n       with this policy statement.\n       (2) Exclusions. – A reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment is not consistent with this\n       policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) if –\n\n       (A) None of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant; or\n       (B) An amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant's\n       applicable guideline range.\n       (3) Limitation. – Consistent with subsection (b), proceedings under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this\n       policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.\n\n       (b) Determination of Reduction in Term of Imprisonment.–\n       (1) In General. – In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant's term\n       of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court\n       shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\n       if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) had been in effect at the time the\n       defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, the court shall substitute only the\n       amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied\n       when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions\n       unaffected.\n       (2) Limitation and Prohibition on Extent of Reduction.–\n       (A) Limitation. – Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the\n       defendant's term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term\n       that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of\n       this subsection.\n       (B) Exception for Substantial Assistance. – If the term of imprisonment imposed was less than\n       the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time\n       of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance\n       to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under\n       subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.\n       (C) Prohibition. – In no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of\n       imprisonment the defendant has already served.\n       (c) Covered Amendments.—Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in\n       Appendix C as follows: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341, 371, 379, 380, 433,454, 461, 484, 488,\n       490, 499, 505, 506, 516, 591, 599, 606, 657, 702, 706 as amended by 711, 715, and 750 (parts\n       A and C only).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 16\n\n\n       (A)     Eligibility. — Eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C.\n               § 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in\n               subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range (i.e., the\n               guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal\n               history category determined pursuant to § 1B1.1(a), which is\n               determined before consideration of any departure provision in the\n               Guidelines Manual or any variance). Accordingly, a reduction in\n               defendant’s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18\n               U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy\n               statement if: (i) none of the amendments listed in subsection (c)\n               is applicable to the defendant; or (ii) an amendment listed in\n               subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant but the amendment\n               does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable\n               guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or\n               statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of\n               imprisonment).\n\n(Emphasis added.) The government argues that the old statutory minimums still\n“operate” as “another guideline or statutory provision” to prevent the lowering of the\n“applicable guideline range,” even though these minimums have been repealed and the\nnew minimums have been incorporated into the Commission’s new crack guidelines.\nWhy does the parenthetical phrase at the end of the Note — “e.g., a statutory mandatory\nminimum term of imprisonment” — refer to the old, discriminatory minimums instead\nof the new, more lenient ones that presumably are not racially discriminatory? The\nstatutory minimums have been reduced and incorporated into the guidelines by the\nSentencing Commission. The old, repealed discriminatory minimums are no longer a\npart “of the operation of” the sentencing system. They should not be used to foreclose\n“lowering the defendant’s applicable guideline range.” We should not presume that the\nSentencing Commission would point out to Congress the racially discriminatory nature\nof the old crack guidelines, and request new mandatory minimums around which to\nrebuild the new retroactive guidelines, and then decide to retain the old crack minimums\nas the “guideline sentence” under §5G1.1(b).\n\n                                    IV. Conclusion\n\n       The old crack cocaine statutory minimums are racially discriminatory as the\nlegislative history of the Fair Sentencing Act makes clear, as the Dorsey case states, and\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 17\n\n\nas the Sentencing Commission reports to Congress advise. Perpetuation of such racially\ndiscriminatory sentences by federal courts is unconstitutional and therefore the\nsentencing guidelines must be interpreted to eliminate such a result. Accordingly, the\njudgment of the district court is reversed and remanded for the resentencing of plaintiffs\nin accordance with this opinion.\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v.

I fear that my panel\ncolleagues have sua sponte set sail into the constitutional sea of equal protection without\nany legal ballast to keep their analysis afloat. To start with, they “readily acknowledge\nthat no party challenges the constitutionality of denying retroactive application of the\nFair Sentencing Act to people who were sentenced under the old regime.” Maj. Op. 6.\nOpining on this unbriefed and unargued issue is thus fraught with the likelihood of\nrunning aground on the shoals of uncharted territory.\n\n        They further concede that the law establishing the 100-to-1 ratio between powder\ncocaine and crack cocaine for sentencing purposes was constitutional when enacted:\n\n        When the old 100-to-1 crack cocaine statute was adopted, it presumably\n        did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there was no intent\n        or design to discriminate on a racial basis. Its adoption was simply a\n        mistake.\n\nMaj. Op. 8.\n\n        So far, so good. But then the majority veers off into the abyss with the following\nanalysis:\n\n        Since 1986, however, we have gained knowledge of the old statute’s\n        devastating effect on blacks. . . . The discriminatory nature of the old\n        sentencing regime is so obvious that it cannot seriously be argued that\n        race does not play a role in the failure to retroactively apply the Fair\n        Sentencing Act. A “disparate impact” case now becomes an intentional\n        subjugation or discriminatory purpose case. Like slavery and Jim Crow\n        laws, the intentional maintenance of discriminatory sentences is a denial\n        of equal protection.\n\nId. at 8-9.\n\n        The majority reaches this conclusion without citing a single case in support. This\nis not due to a lack of diligent research; it is due to the lack of any such cases. The best\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 19\n\n\nthe majority can do is try to distinguish two Supreme Court decisions (McCleskey v.\nKemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111869\"><a href=\"/opinion/111869/mccleskey-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), and Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110098\"><a href=\"/opinion/110098/personnel-administrator-of-mass-v-feeney/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979)) that even the majority concedes “on first glance might appear to\nsanction the discrimination at issue here.” Maj. Op. 9. Those efforts at distinguishing\nMcCleskey and Feeney are in vain, however, because binding Sixth Circuit precedent has\nalready foreclosed the majority’s constitutional argument.\n\n       The majority reaches the issue of equal protection not directly, but through\napplying the “constitutional-doubt canon” of statutory construction (also known as\n“constitutional avoidance,” see Clark v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137741\"><a href=\"/opinion/137741/clark-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (2005)). Maj. Op.\n6. Two conditions are necessary before a court may invoke this interpretative canon:\n(1) the statute in question must be “susceptible of two constructions,” and (2) one\nconstruction raises “grave and doubtful constitutional questions” that the other\nconstruction avoids. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The present case meets\nneither condition.\n\n       I start with the first condition. This court has already interpreted the Fair\nSentencing Act as applied to dozens of defendants who, like the Blewetts, were\nconvicted and sentenced prior to the effective date of the Act. See, e.g., United States\nv. Hammond, — F.3d —, No. 12-5522, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1363908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. Apr. 5, 2013);\nUnited States v. Hollins, No. 12-5182, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5477119</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. Nov. 13, 2012);\nUnited States v. Downs, 487 F. App’x 286 (6th Cir. 2012). In each of these decisions,\nthis court has held that the Act is not retroactive to defendants who were convicted and\nsentenced before its effective date.\n\n       The majority therefore errs in employing the constitutional-avoidance canon to\nselect a construction of the Act that is favorable to the Blewetts when this court has\nalready chosen the contrary construction. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 385 (“The canon of\nconstitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary\ntextual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and\nthe canon functions as a means of choosing between them.” (emphasis in original)). We\nare instead bound by Hammond, a prior reported decision that interprets the same statute\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 20\n\n\nunder the same factual circumstances as the present case. See, e.g., Salmi v. Sec’y of\nHealth & Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"459011\"><a href=\"/opinion/459011/jan-m-sexton-salmi-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689 (6th Cir. 1985) (“A panel of this Court\ncannot overrule the decision of another panel. The prior decision remains controlling\nauthority unless an inconsistent decision of the United States Supreme Court requires\nmodification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       And even if Hammond were not fatal to the cause taken up by my colleagues,\ntheir resort to the constitutional-avoidance canon would still be flawed because this court\nhas already answered any “grave and doubtful constitutional questions” raised by the\ncontinued application of the old crack-cocaine/powder-cocaine sentencing disparity.\nOver 20 years ago, this court held that “the one to one hundred ratio of crack to cocaine\ndoes not violate Equal Protection Standards.” United States v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582715\"><a href=\"/opinion/582715/united-states-v-raymond-williams-91-1025-kevin-t-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1227 (6th Cir. 1992).\n\n       Subsequent equal protection attacks on the crack/powder ratio have likewise been\nrejected. See, e.g., United States v. Reece, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607894\"><a href=\"/opinion/607894/united-states-v-reginald-reece/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding\nthat the ratio’s disparate impact “may not alone support a finding of invidious\ndiscrimination in a facially neutral law”); United States v. Muse, 250 F. App’x 700, 701-\n02 (6th Cir. 2007) (noting that the Sixth Circuit has already rejected equal protection\narguments for invalidating the 100-to-1 ratio and that “[e]very court of appeals to\naddress the issue has upheld the ratio in the face of similar constitutional challenges”).\nJust as Hammond resolves any doubt of statutory interpretation regarding the limited\nretroactivity of the Fair Sentencing Act, so do Reece and Williams resolve any doubt\nregarding the constitutionality of pre-Act sentences that the Act leaves intact. Moreover,\nknowledge of the ratio’s disparate racial impact—which is the majority’s rationale for\ndistinguishing the constitutional validity of the ratio’s initial enactment from the\nconstitutional invalidity of its continued enforcement—was recognized and rejected as\nthe basis of the equal protection challenge in Reece. See 994 F.2d at 278 (noting the\ndefendant’s use of statistics to show a disparate racial impact, but holding that evidence\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 21\n\n\nof such impact was insufficient because “only purposeful discrimination merits strict\nscrutiny”).\n\n       Another point bears mentioning. The majority’s basic premise is that the\ncontinued enforcement of a sentencing regime that equates one gram of crack cocaine\nto one hundred grams of powder cocaine violates the Equal Protection Clause because\nit has a known disparate racial impact. Yet the majority apparently has no problem with\nthe Fair Sentencing Act’s reduction of that disparity to an 18-to-1 ratio. Why, however,\nis a 100-to-1 ratio—but not an 18-to-1 ratio—an equal protection violation? In my\nopinion, the lack of any constitutionally relevant distinction between the old ratio and\nthe new ratio further undermines the majority’s equal protection rationale.\n\n       Having addressed the shortcomings of the majority’s sua sponte constitutional\nargument, I turn now to the argument that the Blewetts actually presented: i.e., that the\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of the Fair Sentencing Act in Dorsey v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"802791\"><a href=\"/opinion/802791/dorsey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), makes the Act fully retroactive as applied to defendants seeking\nmodification of a mandatory-minimum sentence in a proceeding under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3582(c)(2). As noted above, however, the Hammond decision has already rejected the\nBlewetts’ proposed reading of the Fair Sentencing Act, and it did so “in light of Dorsey.”\nHammond, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1363908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. My colleagues in the majority, moreover, have\npreviously joined in unpublished decisions that reached the same conclusion as set forth\nin Hammond. See United States v. Mundy, 486 F. App’x 598, 598-99 (6th Cir. 2012)\n(per curiam decision joined by Judge Martin); United States v. Stanley, No. 11-4423,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4014932</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (6th Cir. Sept. 12, 2012) (opinion joined by Judge Merritt).\nIn short, Hammond is the law of this circuit and cannot be overturned by this panel.\n\n       But even if we were to approach this issue with no prior circuit precedent to bind\nus, the Blewetts’ argument would fail because 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) allows a court to\nmodify a term of imprisonment that has already been imposed only if two conditions are\nmet:   (1)    the defendant’s sentence was based on a sentencing range that has\nsubsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, and (2) a reduction in the\ndefendant’s sentence would be consistent with the so-called “policy statement” found\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582         United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 22\n\n\nat U.S. Sentencing Guidelines § 1B1.10. The Blewetts, however, were sentenced under\na mandatory-minimum statute that was subsequently amended by Congress, not a\n“sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.”\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) (emphases added).\n\n       In an effort to satisfy the first condition of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), the majority\nnotes that “[t]he statutory minimums are closely integrated into the structure of the\nrevised guidelines.” Maj. Op. 13-14. But why this close integration precludes Congress\nfrom treating the two sentencing schemes differently is unexplained. See Hammond,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1363908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (holding that the defendant’s mandatory-minimum sentence\n“has not subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission” and therefore could\nnot qualify for a modification under § 3582(c)(2) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       The Blewetts fare no better under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)’s second condition\nbecause only those amendments to the Guidelines included in USSG § 1B1.10(c) may\ntrigger eligibility for a sentence modification under § 3582(c)(2). USSG § 1B1.10, cmt.\nn.1(A) (2012). Guideline § 1B1.10(c) incorporates Amendment 750 (parts A and C\nonly), which implemented certain aspects of the Fair Sentencing Act. Part A amended\nthe Drug Quantity Table found in USSG § 2D1.1 that is used to calculate sentencing\nranges, while part C eliminated the reference in USSG § 2D2.1 to a five-year mandatory-\nminimum sentence for simple possession of more than five grams of crack cocaine.\n\n       In contrast, the Blewetts asked the district court for a sentence modification\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) based on the Fair Sentencing Act’s amendment of 21\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1), the latter providing the mandatory-minimum sentences for drug-\ntrafficking offenses. But neither part A nor part C of Amendment 750 includes the\nchanges made to § 841(b)(1). Because the Blewetts seek the benefit of a statutory\namendment that was not incorporated into USSG § 1B1.10, they are ineligible for a\nmodification of their sentences. See Hammond, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1363908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (holding that\nthe district court did not have authority to reduce a defendant’s sentence under\n§ 3582(c)(2) because the defendant’s mandatory-minimum sentence “was not an\namendment incorporated into the Sentencing Commission’s policy statement”).\n\fNos. 12-5226/5582          United States v. Blewett, et al.                       Page 23\n\n\n       The Dorsey decision strongly supports the proposition that the Fair Sentencing\nAct’s amendment of a statutory mandatory-minimum sentence provides no relief to\ndefendants seeking modification of a sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) because\nchanges in criminal penalties generally apply to defendants not yet sentenced, but do not\napply to defendants already sentenced. See Dorsey, 132 S. Ct. at 2335. A proceeding\nunder § 3582(c)(2) is a modification of a previously imposed sentence and is not itself\na sentencing or resentencing. Dillon v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148795\"><a href=\"/opinion/148795/dillon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Dorsey, 132 S.Ct. at 2335 (distinguishing the\ninitial imposition of a sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3553 from the modification of a\nsentence under § 3582(c) and recognizing that disparities “will exist whenever Congress\nenacts a new law changing sentences,” but concluding that the disparity created by the\nCourt’s decision reflects “the ordinary practice” in federal sentencing); see also\nHammond, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1363908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (noting that “Dorsey itself disfavors [retroactive\napplication of the Fair Sentencing Act] in the context of § 3582”).\n\n       Finally, the majority contends that “it cannot seriously be argued that race does\nnot play a role in the failure to retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act.” Maj. Op.\n8. To the contrary, the failure to retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act is solely\ndue to a faithful interpretation of the statutory scheme and a recognition of the rule of\nstare decisis.
