Elane Photography, which does not contest its public accommodation status\nunder the NMHRA, offers wedding photography services to the general public and posts its\nphotographs on a password-protected website for its customers. In this case, Elane\nPhotography refused to photograph a commitment ceremony between two women. The\nquestions presented are (1) whether Elane Photography violated the NMHRA when it\nrefused to photograph the commitment ceremony, and if so, (2) whether this application of\nthe NMHRA violates either the Free Speech or the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, or (3) whether this application violates the\nNew Mexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act (NMRFRA), NMSA 1978, §§ 28-22-1 to\n-5 (2000).\n\n{2}      First, we conclude that a commercial photography business that offers its services\nto the public, thereby increasing its visibility to potential clients, is subject to the\nantidiscrimination provisions of the NMHRA and must serve same-sex couples on the same\nbasis that it serves opposite-sex couples. Therefore, when Elane Photography refused to\nphotograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, it violated the NMHRA in the same way as\nif it had refused to photograph a wedding between people of different races.\n\n{3}    Second, we conclude that the NMHRA does not violate free speech guarantees\n\n                                            3\n\fbecause the NMHRA does not compel Elane Photography to either speak a government-\nmandated message or to publish the speech of another. The purpose of the NMHRA is to\nensure that businesses offering services to the general public do not discriminate against\nprotected classes of people, and the United States Supreme Court has made it clear that the\nFirst Amendment permits such regulation by states. Businesses that choose to be public\naccommodations must comply with the NMHRA, although such businesses retain their First\nAmendment rights to express their religious or political beliefs. They may, for example, post\na disclaimer on their website or in their studio advertising that they oppose same-sex\nmarriage but that they comply with applicable antidiscrimination laws. We also hold that\nthe NMHRA is a neutral law of general applicability, and as such, it does not violate the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n{4}   Finally, we hold that the NMRFRA is inapplicable in this case because the\ngovernment is not a party. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n{5}     The NMHRA prohibits, among other things, discriminatory practices against certain\ndefined classes of people. See § 28-1-7. In 2003, the NMHRA was amended to add “sexual\norientation” as a class of persons protected from discriminatory treatment. 2003 N.M. Laws,\nch. 383, § 2. “Sexual orientation” is defined in the NMHRA as “heterosexuality,\nhomosexuality or bisexuality, whether actual or perceived.” Section 28-1-2(P). In this case,\nwe are concerned with discrimination by a public accommodation against a person because\nof that person’s real or perceived homosexuality—that person’s propensity to experience\nfeelings of attraction and romantic love for other members of the same sex.\n\n{6}     “Public accommodation” is defined in the NMHRA as “any establishment that\nprovides or offers its services, facilities, accommodations or goods to the public, but does\nnot include a bona fide private club or other place or establishment that is by its nature and\nuse distinctly private.” Section 28-1-2(H). Thus, a business that elects not to offer its goods\nor services to the public is not subject to the NMHRA.\n\n{7}    Vanessa Willock contacted Elane Photography, LLC, by e-mail to inquire about\nElane Photography’s services and to determine whether it would be available to photograph\nher commitment ceremony1 to another woman. Elane Photography’s co-owner and lead\nphotographer, Elaine Huguenin, is personally opposed to same-sex marriage and will not\n\n\n       1\n         Willock referred to the event as a “commitment ceremony” in her e-mail to Elane\nPhotography. However, the parties agree that the ceremony was essentially a\nwedding—Elane Photography emphasizes that there were vows, rings, a minister, flower\ngirls, and a wedding dress, and Willock uses the word “wedding” to describe the ceremony\nin her brief. We use the terms “wedding” and “commitment ceremony” interchangeably.\n\n                                              4\n\fphotograph any image or event that violates her religious beliefs. Huguenin responded to\nWillock that Elane Photography photographed only “traditional weddings.” Willock e-\nmailed back and asked, “Are you saying that your company does not offer your photography\nservices to same-sex couples?” Huguenin responded, “Yes, you are correct in saying we do\nnot photograph same-sex weddings,” and thanked Willock for her interest.\n\n{8}     In order to verify Elane Photography’s policy, Willock’s partner, Misti Collinsworth,\ne-mailed Elane Photography and inquired about its willingness to photograph a wedding,\nwithout mentioning the sexes of the participants. Huguenin sent Collinsworth a list of\npricing information and an invitation to meet with her and discuss her services. A few weeks\nlater, Huguenin again e-mailed Collinsworth to follow up.\n\n{9}     Willock filed a discrimination complaint against Elane Photography with the New\nMexico Human Rights Commission for discriminating against her based on her sexual\norientation in violation of the NMHRA. The Commission concluded that Elane Photography\nhad discriminated against Willock in violation of Section 28-1-7(F), which prohibits\ndiscrimination by public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation, among other\nprotected classifications. It awarded Willock attorneys’ fees, which Willock later waived.\nNo other monetary or injunctive relief was granted.\n\n{10} Elane Photography appealed to the Second Judicial District Court for a trial de novo\npursuant to Section 28-1-13(A). See NMSA 1978, § 39-3-1 (1955) (“All appeals from\ninferior tribunals to the district courts shall be tried anew in said courts on their merits, as\nif no trial had been had below, except as otherwise provided by law.”). Elane Photography\nsought a reversal of the award of attorneys’ fees, a declaratory judgment that it had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, and a ruling that its rights had been violated,\namong other relief. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district\ncourt granted summary judgment for Willock. Elane Photography again appealed, and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2012-NMCA-086, ¶ 1, 284\nP.3d 428. We granted certiorari.\n\n{11} Elane Photography argues before this Court that: (1) it did not discriminate on the\nbasis of sexual orientation, and therefore it did not violate the NMHRA; or, alternatively, (2)\nby requiring Elane Photography to accept clients against its will, the NMHRA violates the\nprotection of the First Amendment against compelled speech; (3) the NMHRA violates\nElane Photography’s First Amendment right to freely exercise its religion; and (4) the\nNMHRA violates Elane Photography’s right under the NMRFRA to freely exercise its\nreligion. For the reasons that follow, we reject Elane Photography’s arguments and affirm\nsummary judgment for Willock.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n{12} The parties agree on the facts in this case, and the only question for this Court to\nconsider is whether Willock is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Self v. United\n\n                                               5\n\fParcel Serv., Inc., 1998-NMSC-046, ¶ 6, 126 N.M. 396, 970 P.2d 582 (“Summary judgment\nis appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law.”). On appeal, we review a grant of summary judgment de\nnovo. Id.\n\nI.      ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY REFUSED TO SERVE WILLOCK ON THE\n        BASIS OF HER SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN VIOLATION OF THE NMHRA\n\n{13} The NMHRA seeks to promote the equal rights of people within certain specified\nclasses by protecting them against discriminatory treatment. See Juneau v. Intel Corp.,\n2006-NMSC-002, ¶ 14, 139 N.M. 12, 127 P.3d 548 (“The NMHRA protects against\ndiscriminatory treatment . . . .”). To accomplish this goal, the NMHRA makes it unlawful\nfor “any person in any public accommodation to make a distinction, directly or indirectly,\nin offering or refusing to offer its services, facilities, accommodations or goods to any person\nbecause of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender\nidentity, spousal affiliation or physical or mental handicap.” Section 28-1-7(F) (emphasis\nadded). The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s holding that Elane Photography\nwas a public accommodation under Section 28-1-2(H), Elane Photography, 2012-NMCA-\n086, ¶ 18, and Elane Photography did not challenge that holding in this appeal. Accordingly,\nElane Photography waived its right to challenge that conclusion as a matter of New Mexico\nlaw. See Fikes v. Furst, 2003-NMSC-033, ¶ 8, 134 N.M. 602, 81 P.3d 545 (“[I]t is improper\nfor this Court to consider any questions except those set forth in the petition for certiorari.”).\nWe therefore accept the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that at the time of its interactions with\nWillock and Collinsworth, Elane Photography was a public accommodation as defined in\nSection 28-1-2(H), and as such, was subject to Section 28-1-7(F) of the NMHRA. See Elane\nPhotography, 2012-NMCA-086, ¶¶ 14, 18.\n\n{14} Elane Photography argues that it did not violate the NMHRA because it did not\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation when it refused service to Willock. Instead,\nElane Photography explains that it “did not want to convey through [Huguenin]’s pictures\nthe story of an event celebrating an understanding of marriage that conflicts with [the\nowners’] beliefs.” Elane Photography argues that it would have taken portrait photographs\nand performed other services for same-sex customers, so long as they did not request\nphotographs that involved or endorsed same-sex weddings. However, Elane Photograph’s\nowners testified that they would also have refused to take photos of same-sex couples in\nother contexts, including photos of a couple holding hands or showing affection for each\nother. Elane Photography also argues in its brief that it would have turned away\nheterosexual customers if the customers asked for photographs in a context that endorsed\nsame-sex marriage. For example, Elane Photography states that it “would have declined the\nrequest even if the ceremony was part of a movie and the actors playing the same-sex couple\nwere heterosexual.” Therefore, Elane Photography reasons that it did not discriminate\n“because of . . . sexual orientation,” § 28-1-7(F), but because it did not wish to endorse\nWillock’s and Collinsworth’s wedding.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f{15} The NMHRA prohibits discrimination in broad terms by forbidding “any person in\nany public accommodation to make a distinction, directly or indirectly, in offering or\nrefusing to offer its services . . . because of . . . sexual orientation.” Section 28-1-7(F)\n(emphasis added). Elane Photography is primarily a wedding photography business. It\nprovides wedding photography services to heterosexual couples, but it refuses to work with\nhomosexual couples under equivalent circumstances.\n\n{16} Elane Photography’s argument is an attempt to distinguish between an individual’s\nstatus of being homosexual and his or her conduct in openly committing to a person of the\nsame sex. It was apparently Willock’s e-mail request to have Elane Photography photograph\nWillock’s commitment ceremony to another woman that signaled Willock’s sexual\norientation to Elane Photography, regardless of whether that assessment was real or merely\nperceived. The difficulty in distinguishing between status and conduct in the context of\nsexual orientation discrimination is that people may base their judgment about an\nindividual’s sexual orientation on the individual’s conduct. To allow discrimination based\non conduct so closely correlated with sexual orientation would severely undermine the\npurpose of the NMHRA.\n\n{17} The United States Supreme Court has rejected similar attempts to distinguish\nbetween a protected status and conduct closely correlated with that status. In Christian\nLegal Society Chapter of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law v.\nMartinez, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 2980 (2010), students at Hastings College of\nthe Law formed a chapter of the Christian Legal Society and sought formal recognition from\nthe school. The Christian Legal Society required its members to affirm their belief in the\ndivinity of Jesus Christ and to refrain from “‘unrepentant homosexual conduct.’” Id. & id.\nn.3. Hastings refused to recognize the organization on the ground that it violated Hastings’\nnondiscrimination policy, which prohibited exclusion based on religion or sexual orientation.\nId. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 2980. The Christian Legal Society argued that “it [did] not exclude\nindividuals because of sexual orientation, but rather on the basis of a conjunction of conduct\nand the belief that the conduct is not wrong.” Id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 2990 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The United States Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating:\n\n       Our decisions have declined to distinguish between status and conduct in this\n       context. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 575, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156\n       L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (“When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law\n       of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject\n       homosexual persons to discrimination.” (emphasis added)); id., at 583, 123\n       S.Ct. 2472 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (“While it is true that the\n       law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that\n       is closely correlated with being homosexual. Under such circumstances,\n       [the] law is targeted at more than conduct. It is instead directed toward gay\n       persons as a class.”); cf. Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S.\n       263, 270, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993) (“A tax on wearing\n       yarmulkes is a tax on Jews.”).\n\n                                              7\n\fId. We agree that when a law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, that\nlaw similarly protects conduct that is inextricably tied to sexual orientation. Otherwise we\nwould interpret the NMHRA as protecting same-gender couples against discriminatory\ntreatment, but only to the extent that they do not openly display their same-gender sexual\norientation.\n\n{18} In this case, we see no basis for distinguishing between discrimination based on\nsexual orientation and discrimination based on someone’s conduct of publicly committing\nto a person of the same sex. Our role is to determine and follow the intent of the Legislature,\nState v. Hall, 2013-NMSC-001, ¶ 9, 294 P.3d 1235, and the NMHRA evinces a clear intent\nto prevent discrimination as it is broadly defined in Section 28-1-7(F). New Mexico has a\nstrong state policy of promoting equality for its residents regardless of sexual orientation.\nSee Section 28-1-7 (defining unlawful discriminatory practices); NMSA 1978, § 29-21-2\n(2009) (prohibiting profiling by law enforcement on the basis of sexual orientation); NMSA\n1978, § 31-18B-2(D) (2007) (including sexual orientation as a protected status under the\nHate Crimes Act); Chatterjee v. King, 2012-NMSC-019, ¶ 36, 280 P.3d 283 (recognizing\nthat a child can have two legal parents of the same sex); In re Jacinta M., 1988-NMCA-100,\n¶ 11, 107 N.M. 769, 764 P.2d 1327 (holding that a children’s court could not find a\ncustodian unsuitable solely because of his or her sexual orientation). As a matter of New\nMexico law, the NMHRA prohibits a public accommodation from refusing to serve a client\nbased on sexual orientation, and Elane Photography violated the law by refusing to\nphotograph Willock’s same-sex commitment ceremony.\n\n{19} We are not persuaded by Elane Photography’s argument that it does not violate the\nNMHRA because it will photograph a gay person (for example, in single-person portraits)\nso long as the photographs do not reflect the client’s sexual preferences. The NMHRA\nprohibits public accommodations from making any distinction in the services they offer to\ncustomers on the basis of protected classifications. Section 28-1-7(F). For example, if a\nrestaurant offers a full menu to male customers, it may not refuse to serve entrees to women,\neven if it will serve them appetizers. The NMHRA does not permit businesses to offer a\n“limited menu” of goods or services to customers on the basis of a status that fits within one\nof the protected categories. Therefore, Elane Photography’s willingness to offer some\nservices to Willock does not cure its refusal to provide other services that it offered to the\ngeneral public. Similarly, it does not help Elane Photography to argue that it would have\nturned away heterosexual polygamous weddings or heterosexual persons pretending to have\na same-sex wedding. Those situations are not at issue here, and, if anything, these arguments\nsupport a finding that Elane Photography intended to discriminate against Willock based on\nher same-sex sexual orientation. Therefore, we hold that Elane Photography discriminated\nagainst Willock on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of the NMHRA.\n\nII.    THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY’S FIRST\n       AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n\n{20}   Elane Photography challenges enforcement of the NMHRA on the grounds that\n\n                                              8\n\fenforcement of the law violates its right to free speech and the free exercise of its religion\nunder the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons that follow,\nwe reject both of these arguments.\n\nA.     THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY’S FREE\n       SPEECH RIGHTS\n\n{21} Specifically regarding its free speech rights, Elane Photography argues that the\nNMHRA compels it to speak in violation of the First Amendment by requiring it to\nphotograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, even though it is against the owners’\npersonal beliefs. We disagree.\n\n{22} The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “Congress shall\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I. This prohibition\napplies equally to state governments. Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666 (1925)\n(assuming without deciding that free speech and press rights are incorporated by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229,\n235 (1963) (“It has long been established that these First Amendment freedoms [of speech,\nassembly, and petition] are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by the\nStates.”). United States Supreme Court precedent makes it clear that the right to speak freely\nincludes the right to refrain from speaking. See, e.g., Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714\n(1977) (“[T]he right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state\naction includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.”).\n\n{23} Elane Photography observes that photography is an expressive art form and that\nphotographs can fall within the constitutional protections of free speech. See Hurley v. Irish-\nAm. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 569 (1995) (observing that\nabstract art and instrumental music are “unquestionably shielded” by the First Amendment).\nElane Photography also states that in the course of its business, it creates and edits\nphotographs for its clients so as to tell a positive story about each wedding it photographs,\nand the company and its owners would prefer not to send a positive message about same-sex\nweddings or same-sex marriage. Elane Photography concludes that by requiring it to\nphotograph same-sex weddings on the same basis that it photographs opposite-sex weddings,\nthe NMHRA unconstitutionally compels it to “create and engage in expression” that sends\na positive message about same-sex marriage not shared by its owner.\n\n{24} The compelled-speech doctrine on which Elane Photography relies is comprised of\ntwo lines of cases. The first line of cases establishes the proposition that the government\nmay not require an individual to “speak the government’s message.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for\nAcademic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 63 (2006). The second line of cases\nprohibits the government from requiring a private actor “to host or accommodate another\nspeaker’s message.” Id. Elane Photography argues that by requiring it to photograph same-\nsex weddings on the same basis as opposite-sex weddings, the NMHRA violates both\nprohibitions. We address each argument in turn.\n\n                                               9\n\f1.     The NMHRA does not compel Elane Photography to speak the government’s\n       message\n\n{25} The right to refrain from speaking was established in West Virginia State Board of\nEducation v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943), in which the United States Supreme Court\nheld that the State of West Virginia could not constitutionally require students to salute the\nAmerican flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The Court held that a state could not\nrequire “affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind,” id. at 633, and that the state had\nimpermissibly “invade[d] the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First\nAmendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official control,” id. at 642.\n\n{26} Similarly, in Wooley, 430 U.S. at 717, the United States Supreme Court held that the\nState of New Hampshire could not constitutionally punish a man for covering the state motto\non the license plate of his car. The Wooley plaintiffs considered “Live Free or Die,” the state\nmotto, “repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs,” id. at 707, and they raised\na First Amendment challenge to the state’s law forbidding residents to hide or alter the\nmotto. Id. at 709, 713. The Wooley Court framed the question presented as “whether the\nState may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an\nideological message by displaying it on his [or her] private property in a manner and for the\nexpress purpose that it be observed and read by the public” and concluded that the measure\nwas unconstitutional. Id. at 713.\n\n{27} Elane Photography reads Wooley and Barnette to mean that the government may not\ncompel people “to engage in unwanted expression.” However, the cases themselves are\nnarrower than Elane Photography suggests; they involve situations in which the speakers\nwere compelled to publicly “speak the government’s message.” Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 63.\nIn Wooley and Barnette, the respective states impermissibly required their residents to affirm\nor display a specific government-selected message: “Live Free or Die” in Wooley, 430 U.S.\nat 707, and allegiance to the flag in Barnette, 319 U.S. at 632-33. Both cases stand for the\nproposition that the First Amendment does not permit the government to “prescribe what\nshall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force\ncitizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” Barnette, 319 U.S. at 642. However,\nunlike the laws at issue in Wooley and Barnette, the NMHRA does not require Elane\nPhotography to recite or display any message. It does not even require Elane Photography\nto take photographs. The NMHRA only mandates that if Elane Photography operates a\nbusiness as a public accommodation, it cannot discriminate against potential clients based\non their sexual orientation.\n\n{28} Furthermore, the laws at issue in Wooley and Barnette had little purpose other than\nto promote the government-sanctioned message. See Wooley, 430 U.S. at 716-17 (rejecting\nthe state’s contentions that (1) the state motto made it easier for law enforcement to identify\nimproper license plates, and (2) the state hoped “to communicate to others an official view\nas to proper appreciation of history, state pride, and individualism”); Barnette, 319 U.S. at\n640 (identifying “national unity” as the goal of compulsory flag salutes) (internal quotation\n\n                                              10\n\fmarks and citation omitted). The Barnette Court noted that the dissenting students’ choice\nnot to salute the flag “[did] not bring them into collision with rights asserted by any other\nindividual.” 319 U.S. at 630. That is not the case here, where Elane Photography’s asserted\nright not to serve same-sex couples directly conflicts with Willock’s right under Section 28-\n1-7(F) of the NMHRA to obtain goods and services from a public accommodation without\ndiscrimination on the basis of her sexual orientation. Antidiscrimination laws have\nimportant purposes that go beyond expressing government values: they ensure that services\nare freely available in the market, and they protect individuals from humiliation and\ndignitary harm. See Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 307-08 (1969) (stating that the purpose\nof Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was “to [re]move the daily affront and humiliation\ninvolved in discriminatory denials of access to facilities ostensibly open to the general\npublic”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S.\n294, 299-300 (1964) (discussing the economic impact of discrimination in public\naccommodations).\n\n{29} The fact that compliance with the NMHRA will require Elane Photography to\nproduce photographs for same-sex weddings to the extent that it would provide those\nservices to a heterosexual couple does not mean that the NMHRA compels speech in the\nmanner of the laws challenged in Wooley and Barnette. Elane Photography’s argument here\nis more analogous to the claims raised by the law schools in Rumsfeld. In that case, a federal\nlaw made universities’ federal funding contingent on the universities allowing military\nrecruiters access to university facilities and services on the same basis as other, non-military\nrecruiters. 547 U.S. at 52-53. A group of law schools that objected to the ban on gays in the\nmilitary challenged the law on a number of constitutional grounds, including that the law in\nquestion compelled them to speak the government’s message. Id. at 52, 53, 61-62. In order\nto assist the military recruiters, schools had to provide services that involved speech, “such\nas sending e-mails and distributing flyers.” Id. at 60.\n\n{30} The United States Supreme Court held that this requirement did not constitute\ncompelled speech. Id. at 62. The Court observed that the federal law “neither limits what\nlaw schools may say nor requires them to say anything.” Id. at 60. Schools were compelled\nonly to provide the type of speech-related services to military recruiters that they provided\nto non-military recruiters. Id. at 62. “There [was] nothing . . . approaching a\nGovernment-mandated pledge or motto that the school [had to] endorse.” Id.\n\n{31} The same situation is true in the instant case. Like the law in Rumsfeld, the NMHRA\ndoes not require any affirmation of belief by regulated public accommodations; instead, it\nrequires businesses that offer services to the public at large to provide those services without\nregard for race, sex, sexual orientation, or other protected classifications. Section 28-1-7(F).\nThe fact that these services may involve speech or other expressive services does not render\nthe NMHRA unconstitutional. See Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 62 (“The compelled speech to\nwhich the law schools point is plainly incidental to the [law’s] regulation of conduct, and it\nhas never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of\nconduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out\n\n                                              11\n\fby means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.” (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)). Elane Photography is compelled to take photographs of same-sex\nweddings only to the extent that it would provide the same services to a heterosexual couple.\nSee id. at 62 (speech assisting military recruiters was “only ‘compelled’ if, and to the extent,\nthe school provide[d] such speech for other recruiters”).\n\n2.     The NMHRA does not compel Elane Photography to host or accommodate the\n       message of another speaker\n\na.     State laws prohibiting discrimination by public accommodations do not constitute\n       compelled speech\n\n{32} The second line of compelled-speech cases deals with situations in which a\ngovernment entity has required a speaker to “host or accommodate another speaker’s\nmessage.” Id. at 63. Elane Photography argues that a same-sex wedding or commitment\nceremony is an expressive event, and that by requiring it to accept a client who is having a\nsame-sex wedding, the NMHRA compels it to facilitate the messages inherent in that event.\nElane Photography argues that there are two messages conveyed by a same-sex wedding or\ncommitment ceremony: first, that such ceremonies exist, and second, that these occasions\ndeserve celebration and approval. Elane Photography does not wish to convey either of these\nmessages.\n\n{33} The United States Supreme Court has never found a compelled-speech violation\narising from the application of antidiscrimination laws to a for-profit public accommodation.\nIn fact, it has suggested that public accommodation laws are generally constitutional. See\nHurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (“Provisions like these are well within the State’s usual power to\nenact when a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the target of\ndiscrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate the First or Fourteenth\nAmendments . . . . [T]he focal point of [such statutes is] rather on the act of discriminating\nagainst individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and services on\nthe proscribed grounds.”). The United States Supreme Court has found constitutional\nproblems with some applications of state public accommodation laws, but those problems\nhave arisen when states have applied their public accommodation laws to free-speech events\nsuch as privately organized parades, id. at 566, 573, 580-81, and private membership\norganizations, Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 659, 659 n.4 (2000).2 Elane\nPhotography, however, is an ordinary public accommodation, a “clearly commercial\nentit[y],” id. at 657, that sells goods and services to the public.\n\n{34} The NMHRA does not, nor could it, regulate the content of the photographs that\nElane Photography produces. It does not, for example, mandate that Elane Photography take\n\n\n       2\n       Dale also was decided on freedom of association grounds. Id. at 644. Elane\nPhotography has not argued that its right of expressive association was violated.\n\n                                              12\n\fposed photographs rather than candid shots, nor does it require every wedding album to\ncontain a picture of the bride’s bouquet. Indeed, the NMHRA does not mandate that Elane\nPhotography choose to take wedding pictures; that is the exclusive choice of Elane\nPhotography. Like all public accommodation laws, the NMHRA regulates “the act of\ndiscriminating against individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges,\nand services on the proscribed grounds.” See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (describing the\nMassachusetts public accommodation law). Elane Photography argues that because the\nservice it provides is photography, and because photography is expressive, “some of [the]\nimages will inevitably express the messages inherent in [the] event.” In essence, then, Elane\nPhotography argues that by limiting its ability to choose its clients, the NMHRA forces it to\nproduce photographs expressing its clients’ messages even when the messages are contrary\nto Elane Photography’s beliefs.\n\n{35} Elane Photography has misunderstood this issue. It believes that because it is a\nphotography business, it cannot be subject to public accommodation laws. The reality is that\nbecause it is a public accommodation, its provision of services can be regulated, even though\nthose services include artistic and creative work. If Elane Photography took photographs on\nits own time and sold them at a gallery, or if it was hired by certain clients but did not offer\nits services to the general public, the law would not apply to Elane Photography’s choice of\nwhom to photograph or not. The difference in the present case is that the photographs that\nare allegedly compelled by the NMHRA are photographs that Elane Photography produces\nfor hire in the ordinary course of its business as a public accommodation. This\ndetermination has no relation to the artistic merit of photographs produced by Elane\nPhotography. If Annie Leibovitz or Peter Lindbergh worked as public accommodations in\nNew Mexico, they would be subject to the provisions of the NMHRA. Unlike the\ndefendants in Hurley or the other cases in which the United States Supreme Court has found\ncompelled-speech violations, Elane Photography sells its expressive services to the public.\nIt may be that Elane Photography expresses its clients’ messages in its photographs, but only\nbecause it is hired to do so. The NMHRA requires that Elane Photography perform the same\nservices for a same-sex couple as it would for an opposite-sex couple; the fact that these\nservices require photography stems from the nature of Elane Photography’s chosen line of\nbusiness.\n\n{36} The cases in which the United States Supreme Court found that the government\nunconstitutionally required a speaker to host or accommodate another speaker’s message are\ndistinctly different because they involve direct government interference with the speaker’s\nown message, as opposed to a message-for-hire. In two cases, the Court found a compelled-\nspeech problem where the government explicitly required a publisher to distribute an\nopposing point of view. In the first of these cases, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,\n418 U.S. 241, 244 (1974), the United States Supreme Court invalidated Florida’s “‘right of\nreply’” statute. The law provided that if a candidate for public office was criticized in a\nFlorida newspaper, the candidate could demand that the newspaper print his or her reply,\nfree of cost, in as conspicuous a location as the criticism that had appeared. Id. The Court\nexpressed concern that the statute might deter editors from printing criticism of candidates,\n\n                                              13\n\fthereby chilling political news coverage and commentary in the state. Id. at 257.\nFurthermore, the statute unconstitutionally wrested control over editorial decisions about\n“[t]he choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on\nthe size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials” away\nfrom the editors and into the hands of the state. Id. at 258.\n\n{37} Similarly, in Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California,\n475 U.S. 1, 4, 20-21, 26 (1986) (plurality opinion; Marshall, J., concurring in judgment), a\nplurality of the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional a decision by the\nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission to allow a third-party group to send out messages\nwith a utility’s billing statements. The utility had traditionally distributed a newsletter to its\ncustomers with its monthly billing statements. Id. at 5 (plurality opinion). The Public Utility\nCommission decided that the space in the billing envelopes belonged to the customers, not\nto the utility, and it allowed an intervenor in a ratemaking proceeding involving the utility\nto send out messages in the utility’s billing envelopes four times per year. Id. at 5-6, 13\n(plurality opinion). Citing Tornillo, the United States Supreme Court held that this decision\nunconstitutionally compelled the utility to accommodate the intervenor’s speech. Pacific\nGas, 475 U.S. at 9-13 (plurality opinion). The Court noted that the Commission’s ruling\nrequired the utility to disseminate messages that were hostile to the utility’s own interests,\nid. at 14 (plurality opinion), and, depending on what the intervenors said, the utility might\n“be forced either to appear to agree with [the intervenors’] views or to respond,” when it\nwould have preferred to remain silent on an issue. Id. at 15 (plurality opinion).\n\n{38} In both Pacific Gas and Tornillo, the government commandeered a speaker’s means\nof reaching its audience and required the speaker to disseminate an opposing point of view.\nNothing analogous occurred in the present case. Elane Photography is not required to print\nthe names and addresses of rival photographers in its albums, nor does Elane Photography\ndistribute a newsletter in which the government has required it to print someone else’s ideas.\nInstead, the allegedly compelled message is Elane Photography’s own work on behalf of its\nclients, which it distributes only to its clients and their loved ones. The government has not\ninterfered with Elane Photography’s editorial judgment; the only choice regulated is Elane\nPhotography’s choice of clients.\n\n{39} In addition, although Elane Photography raises concerns that its speech will be\nchilled, there is no risk of a chilling effect in this case. In Tornillo, the “‘right of reply’”\nstatute could have discouraged newspapers from printing criticism of political candidates.\n418 U.S. at 257. By contrast, the relevant choice facing Elane Photography and similar\nbusinesses is not whether to publish a story, as in Tornillo, but whether to operate as a public\naccommodation. If a commercial photography business wishes to offer its services to the\npublic, thereby increasing its visibility to potential clients, it will be subject to the\nantidiscrimination provisions of the NMHRA. If a commercial photography business\nbelieves that the NMHRA stifles its creativity, it can remain in business, but it can cease to\noffer its services to the public at large. Elane Photography’s choice to offer its services to\nthe public is a business decision, not a decision about its freedom of speech.\n\n                                               14\n\f{40} In Pacific Gas and Tornillo, a government entity overtly required a speaker to\npublicize an opposing message. Elane Photography cites a third case, Hurley, in which the\ncompelled-speech violation was more subtle. In Hurley, 515 U.S. at 560-61, the private\norganizers of the Boston St. Patrick’s Day parade denied the application of a group of gay,\nlesbian, and bisexual Irish-Americans (known as GLIB) to march as a unit in the parade. Id.\nat 561. Massachusetts courts held that this constituted discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. Id. at 561, 563-64. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the\nparade did not discriminate against gay participants; instead, the issue was “the admission\nof GLIB as its own parade unit carrying its own banner,” which had unquestionable\nexpressive content. Id. at 572, 581.\n\n{41} Hurley is different from the instant case in two significant ways. First, the\nMassachusetts courts appear to have erroneously classified the privately organized parade\nas a public accommodation. See id. at 573 (“[T]he state courts’ application of the statute had\nthe effect of declaring the sponsors’ speech itself to be the public accommodation.”).\nSecond, parades by their nature express a message to the public. Id. at 568. By requiring\nthe parade organizers to include GLIB, the Massachusetts courts directly altered the\nexpressive content of the parade. Id. at 572-73. The presence of a group in a parade carries\nexpressive weight, and Hurley implicated associational rights as well as free-speech rights.\nId. at 565; see Dale, 530 U.S. at 659 (“Although we did not explicitly deem the parade in\nHurley an expressive association, the analysis we applied there is similar to the analysis we\napply here.”). Elane Photography argues that photographs are also inherently expressive,\nso Hurley must apply to this case as well. However, the NMHRA applies not to Elane\nPhotography’s photographs but to its business operation, and in particular, its business\ndecision not to offer its services to protected classes of people. While photography may be\nexpressive, the operation of a photography business is not. By way of analogy, the NMHRA\ncould not dictate which groups a parade organizer had to include. However, if a business\nsold parade-planning services, and that business operated as a public accommodation, the\nNMHRA would prohibit that business from refusing to offer parade-planning services to\npersons because of their sexual orientation. Thus, Elane Photography’s reliance on Hurley\nis misplaced.\n\n{42} Elane Photography’s situation is actually clearer than that of our hypothetical\nbusiness that organized parades, because even a parade for hire would still be a public event.\nSee id. at 568 (describing the public nature of parades and their dependence on parade-\nwatchers). By contrast, Elane Photography does not routinely publish for or display its\nwedding photographs to the public. Instead, it creates an album for each customer and posts\nthe photographs on a password-protected website for the customers and their friends and\nfamily to view. Whatever message Elane Photography’s photographs may express, they\nexpress that message only to the clients and their loved ones, not to the public.\n\n{43} We note that when Elane Photography displays its photographs publicly and on its\nown behalf, rather than for a client, such as in advertising, its choices of which photographs\nto display are entirely its own. The NMHRA does not require Elane Photography to either\n\n                                             15\n\finclude photographs of same-sex couples in its advertisements or display them in its studio.\nHowever, if Elane Photography offers its services to the public, the NMHRA requires Elane\nPhotography to provide those same services to clients who are members of a protected class\nunder the NMHRA.\n\nb.     Observers are unlikely to believe that Elane Photography’s photographs reflect the\n       views of either its owners or its employees\n\n{44} Elane Photography also argues that if it is compelled to photograph same-sex\nweddings, observers will believe that it and its owners approve of same-sex marriage. The\nUnited States Supreme Court incorporates the question of perceived endorsement into its\nanalysis in cases that involve compulsion to host or accommodate third-party speech. See,\ne.g., Hurley, 515 U.S. at 577 (“Without deciding on the precise significance of the likelihood\nof misattribution, it nonetheless becomes clear that in the context of an expressive parade\n. . . the parade’s overall message is distilled from the individual presentations along the way,\nand each unit’s expression is perceived by spectators as part of the whole.”). The Hurley\nCourt observed that admitting GLIB or any other organization into a parade would likely be\nperceived as a message from the parade organizers “that [GLIB’s] message was worthy of\npresentation and quite possibly of support as well.” Id. at 575. Therefore, the Court further\nobserved that the government’s forced inclusion of GLIB compromised the parade\norganizer’s “right to autonomy over [its] message.” Id. at 576.\n\n{45} In contrast to Pacific Gas and Tornillo, the United States Supreme Court has not\nfound compelled speech violations where the government has not explicitly required a\npublisher to disseminate opposing points of view and where observers are unlikely to\nmistake a person’s compliance with the law for endorsement of third-party messages, as in\nHurley. In Rumsfeld, the United States Supreme Court rejected not only the law schools’\nargument that they were forced to speak the government’s message, but also their argument\nthat they were required to host the recruiters’ speech in such a way that violated compelled\nspeech principles. 547 U.S. at 64-65 (“[The law schools’] accommodation of a military\nrecruiter’s message is not compelled speech because the accommodation does not\nsufficiently interfere with any message of the school.”). The law schools in Rumsfeld\nworried that “treat[ing] military and nonmilitary recruiters alike . . . could be viewed as\nsending the message that they see nothing wrong with the military’s policies [regarding gays\nin the military], when they do.” Id. The Rumsfeld Court held that students “can appreciate\nthe difference between speech a school sponsors and speech the school permits because\nlegally required to do so,” and that the law schools were free to express their disagreement\nwith the military’s policy. Id. at 65.\n\n{46} Rumsfeld drew on earlier cases that had considered whether observers would conflate\nthe speech of third parties with the opinions of the parties to the suit. In PruneYard\nShopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 76-78 (1980), a California shopping center was\nsued under a California constitutional provision that required privately owned shopping\ncenters to allow individuals to engage in expressive activities on their premises. The\n\n                                              16\n\fshopping center argued that the state could not constitutionally compel it “to participate in\nthe dissemination of an ideological message.” Id. at 86-87. The United States Supreme\nCourt rejected the argument, id. at 88, holding that because the shopping center was a\nbusiness establishment that was open to the public, “[t]he views expressed by members of\nthe public in passing out pamphlets or seeking signatures for a petition . . . will not likely be\nidentified with those of the owner.” Id. at 87. The Court also noted that the government had\nnot dictated any particular message or engaged in viewpoint discrimination, and that the\nshopping center could disavow the third-party messages by posting its own signs. Id. “Such\nsigns, for example, could disclaim any sponsorship of the message and could explain that\nthe persons are communicating their own messages by virtue of state law.” Id.\n\n{47} Elane Photography makes an argument very similar to one rejected by the Rumsfeld\nCourt: by treating customers alike, regardless of whether they are having same-sex or\nopposite-sex weddings, Elane Photography is concerned that it will send the message that\nit sees nothing wrong with same-sex marriage. Reasonable observers are unlikely to\ninterpret Elane Photography’s photographs as an endorsement of the photographed events.\nIt is well known to the public that wedding photographers are hired by paying customers and\nthat a photographer may not share the happy couple’s views on issues ranging from the\nminor (the color scheme, the hors d’oeuvres) to the decidedly major (the religious service,\nthe choice of bride or groom). As in Rumsfeld and PruneYard, Elane Photography is free\nto disavow, implicitly or explicitly, any messages that it believes the photographs convey.\nWe note that after Rumsfeld, many law schools published open letters expressing their\ncontinued opposition to military policies and military recruitment on campus. See, e.g.,\nDean’s Letter Regarding Military Recruiting on Campus & Faculty Letter Regarding\nMilitary             Recruitment,               Columbia             Law         School,\nhttp://web.law.columbia.edu/careers/military-recruiting-on-campus (last visited Aug. 9,\n2013); Military Recruitment Policy, University of Dayton School of Law,\nhttp://www.udayton.edu/law/career_services/military_recruitment_policy.php (last visited\nAug. 9, 2013); Employer Recruiting Policies and Guidelines, Harvard Law School,\nhttp://www.law.harvard.edu/current/careers/ocs/employers/recruiting-policies-\nemployers/index.html#Non-Discrimination (last visited Aug. 9, 2013). Elane Photography\nand its owners likewise retain their First Amendment rights to express their religious and\npolitical beliefs. They may, for example, post a disclaimer on their website or in their studio\nadvertising that they oppose same-sex marriage but that they comply with applicable\nantidiscrimination laws.\n\nc.      Elane Photography’s allocation of its work time does not raise First Amendment\n        concerns\n\n{48} Elane Photography next argues that when its employees spend time taking and\nediting photographs of same-sex weddings, they have less time to spend doing their\npreferred work of photographing opposite-sex weddings. Therefore, by Elane Photography’s\nreasoning, the state has interfered with Elane Photography’s message, just as it did in Pacific\nGas and Tornillo. In Tornillo, the newspaper had limited space to print its stories, and\n\n                                               17\n\fprinting replies by politicians took up space in which the newspaper could have published\nother material. 418 U.S. at 256-57. Similarly, the utility in Pacific Gas was required to\nshare the space inside its billing envelopes; when a third party used the space, the utility\ncould not distribute its own newsletter without paying additional postage. 475 U.S. at 5-6\n(plurality opinion). The instant case is different because Elane Photography does not\nproduce a publication whose limited space has been taken over by the government.\n\n{49} Instead, Elane Photography’s complaint is based on its staff’s limited time. Elane\nPhotography argues that if it accepts same-sex couples as clients, its employees must “spend\na day shooting pictures and three to four weeks selecting, editing, and arranging images” of\nthe clients’ weddings, when they would prefer to spend this time working on images of\nheterosexual weddings. Therefore, it argues, the NMHRA interferes with Elane\nPhotography’s own speech.\n\n{50} We disagree because the allocation of work time is a matter of personal preference,\nnot compelled speech, and it is not constitutionally protected. See Heart of Atlanta Motel,\nInc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 261 (1964) (rejecting Thirteenth Amendment challenge\nto law requiring motel to serve African-American guests). By their nature, laws prohibiting\ndiscrimination in public accommodations require businesses and their employees to spend\ntime and energy serving customers whom they might prefer not to serve. See Hurley, 515\nU.S. at 578 (describing common law public accommodation rules as guaranteeing that\nindividuals “will not be turned away merely on the proprietor’s exercise of personal\npreference”). These laws apply even when the businesses provide skillful or physically\nintimate services. See Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 628-29 (1998) (applying public\naccommodations provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act to dental practice). This\nis the purpose of antidiscrimination laws: they force businesses to treat customers alike,\nregardless of their race, religion, or other protected status. These laws are necessary\nprecisely because some businesses would otherwise refuse to work with certain customers\nwhom the laws protect.\n\n{51} Antidiscrimination laws have been consistently upheld as constitutional. See, e.g.,\nHurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (“[Public accommodations laws] do not, as a general matter, violate\nthe First or Fourteenth Amendments.”); Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 242-44, 258, 261\n(sustaining Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against challenges based on the\nCommerce Clause and the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments). Elane Photography’s desire\nto work with heterosexual rather than homosexual couples does not give it license to violate\nthe NMHRA.\n\n3.     There is no exemption from antidiscrimination laws for creative or expressive\n       professions\n\n{52} There are no cases from either New Mexico jurisprudence or that of the United States\nSupreme Court that would compel a conclusion that the NMHRA violates Elane\nPhotography’s freedom of speech because it is engaged in a creative and expressive\n\n                                            18\n\fprofession. We decline to draw the line between “creative” or “expressive” professions and\nall others. While individuals in such professions undoubtedly engage in speech, and\nsometimes even create speech for others as part of their services, there is no precedent to\nsuggest that First Amendment protections allow such individuals or businesses to violate\nantidiscrimination laws. The wedding industry in particular employs a variety of\nprofessionals who offer their services to the public and whose work involves significant\nskills and creativity. For example, a flower shop is not intuitively “expressive,” but florists\nuse artistic skills and training to design and construct floral displays. Bakeries also offer\nservices for hire, and wedding cakes are famously intricate and artistic. Courts cannot be\nin the business of deciding which businesses are sufficiently artistic to warrant exemptions\nfrom antidiscrimination laws. These suggestions are not idle hypotheticals: we take judicial\nnotice of a variety of situations in which florists, bakeries, and other wedding vendors have\nrefused to serve same-sex couples. See, e.g., Lee Moran, Baker refuses to make wedding\ncake for lesbian couple, N.Y. Daily News (Feb. 4, 2013),\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/baker-refuses-wedding-cake-lesbian-\ncouple-article-1.1254776; Annette Cary, Arlene’s Flowers in Richland sued by gay couple,\nT r i - C i t y             H e r a l d          ( A p r .          1 8 ,      2 0 1 3 ) ,\nhttp://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/04/18/2361691/arlenes-flowers-in-richland-sued.html\n(quoting a florist as objecting to “using her time and artistic talent to support an event . . .\nthat she believes is wrong”) (emphasis added); see also Cervelli v. Aloha Bed & Breakfast,\nCiv. No. 11-1-3103-12 ECN, Order (Haw. Circ. Court 1st Cir. Apr. 15, 2013)\nwww.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/2013-04-15_-_cervelli_order.pdf (finding that a bed\nand breakfast violated Hawaii’s public accommodation law when it refused service to a\nsame-sex couple and granting partial summary judgment for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief).\n\n{53} We are persuaded by cases suggesting that the First Amendment does not exempt\ncreative or expressive businesses from antidiscrimination laws. In Hishon v. King &\nSpalding, 467 U.S. 69, 71-73 (1984), the United States Supreme Court reversed the dismissal\nof a Title VII employment discrimination complaint against the law firm of King &\nSpalding. In doing so, the Court rejected the firm’s argument that by applying\nantidiscrimination laws to the firm’s selection of its partners, the government “would\ninfringe [First Amendment] constitutional rights of expression or association.” Id. at 78.\nThe Court held that “[i]nvidious private discrimination may be characterized as a form of\nexercising freedom of association protected by the First Amendment, but it has never been\naccorded affirmative constitutional protections.” Id. (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Legal work unquestionably involves creative and\nexpressive skill and effort, but antidiscrimination laws still govern how a law firm runs its\nbusiness.\n\n{54} Elane Photography attempts to distinguish King & Spalding by arguing that the type\nof compelled-speech claim Elane Photography advances should apply only to public\naccommodations law because such an exemption “would protect a firm’s decision not to\nadvocate an argument that its partners cannot in good conscience advance.” However, this\n\n                                              19\n\fdecision would already be protected under New Mexico law. The NMHRA does not\nprohibit a law firm, even one that is a public accommodation, from turning away clients with\nwhose views the firm disagrees or with whom it simply does not wish to work. See § 28-1-\n7(F) (prohibited grounds do not include ideology or personal dislike). What the NMHRA\nforbids, and what Elane Photography’s proposed exception would allow, is for a law firm\nto turn away a client because the firm finds the client offensive on the basis of a protected\nclassification.    Accepting Elane Photography’s argument would exempt from\nantidiscrimination laws any business that provided a creative or expressive service. Such\nan exemption would not be limited to religious objections or to sexual orientation\ndiscrimination; it would allow any business in a creative or expressive field to refuse service\non any protected basis, including race, national origin, religion, sex, or disability.\n\n{55} Elane Photography also suggests that enforcing the NMHRA against it would mean\nthat an African-American photographer could not legally refuse to photograph a Ku Klux\nKlan rally. This hypothetical suffers from the reality that political views and political group\nmembership, including membership in the Klan, are not protected categories under the\nNMHRA. See § 28-1-7(F) (prohibiting public accommodation discrimination based on\n“race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,\nspousal affiliation or physical or mental handicap”). Therefore, an African-American could\ndecline to photograph a Ku Klux Klan rally. However, the point is well-taken when the roles\nin the hypothetical are reversed—a Ku Klux Klan member who operates a photography\nbusiness as a public accommodation would be compelled to photograph an African-\nAmerican under the NMHRA. This result is required by the NMHRA, which seeks to\npromote equal rights and access to public accommodations by prohibiting discrimination\nbased on certain specified protected classifications.\n\n{56} However, adoption of Elane Photography’s argument would allow a photographer\nwho was a Klan member to refuse to photograph an African-American customer’s wedding,\ngraduation, newborn child, or other event if the photographer felt that the photographs would\ncast African-Americans in a positive light or be interpreted as the photographer’s\nendorsement of African-Americans. A holding that the First Amendment mandates an\nexception to public accommodations laws for commercial photographers would license\ncommercial photographers to freely discriminate against any protected class on the basis that\nthe photographer was only exercising his or her right not to express a viewpoint with which\nhe or she disagrees. Such a holding would undermine all of the protections provided by\nantidiscrimination laws.\n\n{57} In short, we conclude that the NMHRA’s prohibition on sexual-orientation\ndiscrimination does not violate Elane Photography’s First Amendment right to refrain from\nspeaking. The government has not required Elane Photography to promote the government’s\nmessage, nor has the government required Elane Photography to facilitate third parties’\nmessages, except to the extent that Elane Photography already facilitates third parties’\nmessages, for hire, as part of the services that it offers as a for-profit public accommodation.\nEven if the services it offers are creative or expressive, Elane Photography must offer its\n\n                                              20\n\fservices to customers without regard for the customers’ race, sex, sexual orientation, or other\nprotected classification.\n\nB.      THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY’S FIRST\n        AMENDMENT FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS\n\n{58} Elane Photography argues that enforcement of the NMHRA against it for refusing\nto photograph Willock’s wedding violates its First Amendment right to freely exercise its\nreligion. See U.S. Const. amend. I (Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise\nof religion).\n\n{59} It is an open question whether Elane Photography, which is a limited liability\ncompany rather than a natural person, has First Amendment free exercise rights. Several\nfederal courts have recently addressed this question with differing outcomes. Compare, e.g.,\nConestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., slip\nop. at 11, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (3d Cir. July 26, 2013, No. 13-1144) (“[W]e conclude that\nfor-profit, secular corporations cannot engage in religious exercise . . . .”), with Grote v.\nSebelius, 708 F.3d 850, 854 (7th Cir. 2013) (“[T]he [plaintiffs’] use of the corporate form\nis not dispositive of the [free exercise] claim.”). However, it is not necessary for this Court\nto address whether Elane Photography has a constitutionally protected right to exercise its\nreligion. Assuming that Elane Photography has such rights, they are not offended by\nenforcement of the NMHRA.\n\n{60} Under established law, “the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of\nthe obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground\nthat the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).”\nEmp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).3 In order to state a valid First Amendment free\nexercise claim, a party must show either (a) that the law in question is not a “neutral law of\ngeneral applicability,” id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) or (b) that the\nchallenge implicates both the Free Exercise Clause and an independent constitutional\nprotection, id. at 881, or possibly (c) that the law operates “in a context that len[ds] itself to\nindividualized government assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.” Id. at 884.\nElane Photography does not claim that the individualized assessment situation is applicable\nto the present case. We address its claims under the other two categories below.\n\n\n\n        3\n         Congress attempted to overrule Smith by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct of 1993 (USRFRA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb (2006). However, the application of the\nUSRFRA to state and local laws was held unconstitutional in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521\nU.S. 507, 511, 519 (1997). The Smith standard continues to be good law for evaluating\nfederal free exercise challenges to state actions. See Christian Legal Soc’y, ___ U.S. at ___\nn.24, ___ n.27, 130 S. Ct. at 2993 n.24, 2995 n.27 (applying Smith standard).\n\n                                               21\n\f1.      The NMHRA is a neutral law of general applicability\n\n{61} The United States Supreme Court elaborated on the rule concerning “law that is\nneutral and of general applicability” in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of\nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531, 546 (1993). A law is not neutral “if [its] object . . . is to infringe\nupon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation.” Id. at 533. It is not\ngenerally applicable if it “impose[s] burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief”\nwhile permitting exceptions for secular conduct or for favored religions. Id. at 543. These\ninquiries are related, id. at 531; the Court observed that improper intent could be inferred if\nthe law was a “‘religious gerrymander’” that burdened religion but exempted similar secular\nactivity. Id. at 534-35. If a law is neither neutral nor generally applicable, it “must be\njustified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to\nadvance that interest.” Id. at 531-32; see also id. at 546 (“The compelling interest standard\nthat we apply once a law fails to meet the Smith requirements is not water[ed] . . . down but\nreally means what it says.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n{62} In Lukumi Babalu Aye, the city of Hialeah had passed several ordinances that\nprohibited religious sacrifice of animals but exempted secular slaughterhouses, kosher\nslaughterhouses, hunting, fishing, euthanasia of unwanted animals, and extermination of\npests. Id. at 526-28, 536, 543-44. The Court held that this was a “religious gerrymander,”\nid. at 535, the result of which was “that few if any killings of animals [were] prohibited other\nthan Santeria sacrifice,” id. at 536. The Court concluded that “[t]he ordinances had as their\nobject the suppression of religion” and were therefore nonneutral. Id. at 542. The Court\nthen examined whether the ordinances were generally applicable and whether the\ngovernment was selectively burdening only religiously motivated conduct. Id. at 542-43.\nThe Court did not precisely define the standard for assessing general applicability, but it did\nobserve that the Hialeah ordinances were grossly under-inclusive with respect to the laws’\nstated goals, id. at 543-45, and it concluded that the laws burdened “only . . . conduct\nmotivated by religious belief.” Id. at 545. The Court applied strict scrutiny to the\nordinances and found them unconstitutional. Id. at 546-47.\n\n{63} Elane Photography argues that the NMHRA is not generally applicable and that this\nCourt therefore should apply strict scrutiny to the application of the NMHRA to Elane\nPhotography. Elane Photography identifies several exemptions from the antidiscrimination\nprovisions of the NMHRA and argues that these exemptions make it not generally\napplicable. Specifically, Elane Photography points to Section 28-1-9(A)(1), which exempts\nsales or rentals of single-family homes if the owner does not own more than three houses,4\nand Section 28-1-9(D), which exempts owners who live in small multi-family dwellings and\nrent out the other units. Elane Photography argues that these exemptions, like those in\n\n\n        4\n         The owner also may not engage in discriminatory advertising. Section 28-1-9(A).\nIn addition, if the seller was not the most recent occupant of the house, he or she is exempt\nfrom the NMHRA for only one sale per twenty-four month period. Section 28-1-9(A)(2).\n\n                                               22\n\fLukumi Babalu Aye, “impermissibly prefer the secular to the religious.”\n\n{64} This is a misreading of Section 28-1-9. Unlike the exemptions in Lukumi Babalu\nAye, the exemptions in Section 28-1-9(A) and (D) apply equally to religious and secular\nconduct. Neither subsection discusses motivation; homeowners who meet the criteria of\nSection 28-1-9(A) and (D) are permitted to discriminate regardless of whether they do so on\nreligious or nonreligious grounds. Therefore, the NMHRA does not target only religiously\nmotivated discrimination, and these exemptions do not prevent the NMHRA from being\ngenerally applicable. These exemptions also do not indicate any animus toward religion by\nthe Legislature that might render the law nonneutral; similar exemptions commonly appear\nin housing discrimination laws, including the federal Fair Housing Act. See 42 U.S.C. §\n3603(b)(1) & (2) (2012) (exempting from compliance “any single-family house sold or\nrented by an owner,” provided such “owner does not own more than three such . . . houses”\nand subject to additional limitations, and also exempting “rooms or units in dwellings\ncontaining living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families\nliving independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such\nliving quarters as his [or her] residence”).\n\n{65} Elane Photography also argues that the exemptions to the NMHRA for religious\norganizations undercut the purpose of the statute. In particular, Elane Photography\nhighlights Section 28-1-9(B) and (C), which in its reading permits religious organizations\nto “decline same-sex couples as customers.”\n\n{66} Once again, Elane Photography’s interpretation rests on a distorted reading of the\nstatute. Section 28-1-9(B) allows religious organizations to “limit[] admission to or giv[e]\npreference to persons of the same religion or denomination or [to make] selections of buyers,\nlessees or tenants” that promote the organization’s religious principles. In the context of\n“buyers, lessees or tenants,” “buyers” clearly refers to purchasers of real estate rather than\nretail customers. Id. Subsection (C) exempts religious organizations from provisions of the\nNMHRA governing sexual orientation and gender identity, but only regarding “employment\nor renting.” If a religious organization sold goods or services to the general public, neither\nsubsection would allow the organization to turn away same-sex couples while catering to\nopposite-sex couples of all faiths. Subsection (B) permits religious organizations to serve\nonly or primarily people of their own faith, as well as to discriminate in certain limited real\nestate transactions; Subsection (C) applies only to employment and, again, to real estate.\n\n{67} In other words, neither of the religious exemptions in Section 28-1-9 would permit\na religious organization to take the actions that Elane Photography did in this case.\nFurthermore, these exemptions do not prevent the NMHRA from being generally applicable.\nExemptions for religious organizations are common in a wide variety of laws, and they\nreflect the attempts of the Legislature to respect free exercise rights by reducing legal\nburdens on religion. See, e.g., Hobbie v. Unemp’t Appeals Comm’n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136,\n144-45 (1987) (observing that the United States Supreme Court “has long recognized that\nthe government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices” and listing\n\n                                              23\n\fexamples). Such exemptions are generally permissible, see Corp. of the Presiding Bishop\nof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 329-30 (1987)\n(upholding religious exemption to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against an\nEstablishment Clause challenge), and in some situations they may be constitutionally\nmandated, see Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC, ___ U.S. ___,\n___, 132 S. Ct. 694, 705-06 (2012) (holding that the First Amendment precludes the\napplication of employment discrimination laws to disputes between religious organizations\nand their ministers).\n\n{68} The exemptions in the NMHRA are ordinary exemptions for religious organizations\nand for certain limited employment and real-estate transactions. The exemptions do not\nprefer secular conduct over religious conduct or evince any hostility toward religion. We\nhold that the NMHRA is a neutral law of general applicability, and as such it does not offend\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n2.      Elane Photography has not adequately briefed its hybrid rights claim\n\n{69} In Smith, the United States Supreme Court left open the possibility that a neutral law\nof general applicability could nevertheless be unconstitutional if the law infringed both free\nexercise rights and an independent constitutional protection. 494 U.S. at 881. The Court\nrecognized that in pre-Smith cases, it had sometimes applied more rigorous scrutiny to\nneutral, generally applicable laws. Id. The Court distinguished those cases by characterizing\nthem not as simple free exercise cases, but as “hybrid situation[s],” id. at 882, in which the\nfree exercise claims were raised “in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such\nas freedom of speech and of the press.” Id. at 881. Elane Photography mentions that\nbecause it raised both a free exercise claim and a compelled-speech claim, it has made a\nhybrid-rights claim under which the NMHRA should receive strict scrutiny.\n\n{70} This Court requires that the parties adequately brief all appellate issues to include an\nargument, the standard of review, and citations to authorities for each issue presented. In re\nAdoption of Doe, 1984-NMSC-024, ¶ 2, 100 N.M. 764, 676 P.2d 1329 (“[T]o present an\nissue on appeal for review, an appellant must submit argument and authority as required by\nrule.” (emphasis omitted)). “We will not review unclear arguments, or guess at what [a\nparty’s] arguments might be.” Headley v. Morgan Mgmt. Corp., 2005-NMCA-045, ¶ 15,\n137 N.M. 339, 110 P.3d 1076. To rule on an inadequately briefed issue, this Court would\nhave to develop the arguments itself, effectively performing the parties’ work for them. See\nState v. Clifford, 1994-NMSC-048, ¶ 19, 117 N.M. 508, 873 P.2d 254 (“We remind counsel\nthat we are not required to do their research . . . .”). This creates a strain on judicial\nresources and a substantial risk of error. It is of no benefit either to the parties or to future\nlitigants for this Court to promulgate case law based on our own speculation rather than the\nparties’ carefully considered arguments.\n\n{71} Elane Photography devotes a single three-sentence paragraph to its hybrid-rights\nclaim, stating that a hybrid claim exists because it has raised a compelled-speech claim and\n\n                                               24\n\fa free exercise claim under the NMRFRA. However, as discussed in this opinion, neither\nof these claims is independently viable, and Elane Photography offers no analysis to explain\nwhy the two claims together should be greater than the sum of their parts. Elane\nPhotography cites two cases, Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, 356 F.3d 1277 (10th Cir. 2004), and\nHealth Services Division, Health & Environment Dep’t v. Temple Baptist Church, 1991-\nNMCA-055, 112 N.M. 262, 814 P.2d 130, but provides no explanation of how or why we\nshould apply these precedents to the facts of this case. As a matter of New Mexico law,\nElane Photography’s briefing of its hybrid-rights claim is inadequate to permit us to review\nthe issue. For this reason, we do not consider its hybrid-rights argument.\n\nIII.   ENFORCEMENT OF THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE THE NMRFRA\n       BECAUSE THE NMRFRA IS NOT APPLICABLE IN A SUIT BETWEEN\n       PRIVATE PARTIES\n\n{72} Finally, Elane Photography argues that the Commission’s enforcement of the\nNMHRA against it violates the New Mexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The\nNMRFRA provides:\n\n               A government agency shall not restrict a person’s free exercise of\n       religion unless:\n\n              A.      the restriction is in the form of a rule of general applicability\n       and does not directly discriminate against religion or among religions; and\n\n               B.      the application of the restriction to the person is essential to\n       further a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means\n       of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n\nSection 28-22-3. “Free exercise of religion” is defined as “an act or a refusal to act that is\nsubstantially motivated by religious belief.” Section 28-22-2(A).\n\n{73} Willock argues, and the Court of Appeals held, that the NMRFRA did not protect\nElane Photography’s refusal to photograph Willock’s wedding, even though the refusal was\nreligiously motivated, because the NMRFRA “was not meant to apply in suits between\nprivate litigants.” Elane Photography, 2012-NMCA-086, ¶ 46. There is no other case law\non this point in New Mexico; the Court of Appeals relied on federal cases interpreting the\nfederal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Id. ¶¶ 46-47.\n\n{74} The NMRFRA states that “[a] person whose free exercise of religion has been\nrestricted by a violation of the New Mexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act may assert\nthat violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief\nagainst a government agency.” Section 28-22-4(A) (emphasis added). Elane Photography\nargues that the phrase “against a government agency” modifies “appropriate relief,” rather\nthan “a judicial proceeding.” In other words, Elane Photography argues that although the\n\n                                             25\n\frelief available is limited, the NMRFRA can be invoked even when the government is not\na party.\n\n{75} However, the statute is violated only if a “government agency” restricts a person’s\nfree exercise of religion. Section 28-22-3. A “government agency” includes “the state or\nany of its political subdivisions, institutions, departments, agencies, commissions,\ncommittees, boards, councils, bureaus or authorities.” Section 28-22-2(B). The list of\ngovernment agencies does not include the Legislature or the courts. It could be expected that\nthe Legislature would have included itself and the courts in Section 28-22-2(B) if it meant\nthe NMRFRA to apply in common-law disputes or private enforcement actions. Instead, the\nexamples of government agencies are exclusively administrative or executive entities.\n\n{76} Moreover, the structure of the NMRFRA as a whole suggests that the Legislature\ncontemplated that the statute would apply only to legal actions in which the government was\na party. The only relief authorized by the statute is “injunctive or declaratory relief against\na government agency,” § 28-22-4(A)(1), or “damages pursuant to the Tort Claims Act” with\nattorneys’ fees and costs, § 28-22-4(A)(2). Nowhere does the NMRFRA authorize damages\nor injunctive relief against a non-governmental party.\n\n{77} Elane Photography argues that because Willock’s suit was adjudicated by the New\nMexico Human Rights Commission, which is presumably a “government agency” for\npurposes of Section 28-22-2(B), the Commission’s decision against it qualifies as a\nrestriction of its free exercise of religion. However, Elane Photography appealed the\nCommission’s determination to a New Mexico district court for a trial de novo pursuant to\nSection 28-1-13(A). The instant appeal concerns the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for Willock; the Commission is not a party to this case, and its order no longer has\nany legal effect. See § 39-3-1 (stating that appeals to the district court for trials de novo\n“shall be tried anew . . . as if no trial had been had below”). Willock argues, and we agree,\nthat the Commission acted merely as an administrative tribunal to decide the dispute between\nElane Photography and herself. The government’s adjudication of disputes between private\nparties does not constitute government restriction of a party’s free exercise rights for\npurposes of the NMRFRA.\n\n{78} For the reasons stated above, we hold that as a matter of New Mexico law, the New\nMexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act is inapplicable to disputes in which a\ngovernment agency is not a party.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n{79} Elane Photography’s refusal to serve Vanessa Willock violated the New Mexico\nHuman Rights Act, which prohibits a public accommodation from refusing to offer its\nservices to a person based on that person’s sexual orientation. Enforcing the NMHRA\nagainst Elane Photography does not violate the Free Speech or the Free Exercise clause of\nthe First Amendment or the NMRFRA. For these reasons, we affirm the grant of summary\n\n                                              26\n\fjudgment in Willock’s favor.\n\n{80}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                               ____________________________________\n                                               EDWARD L.

W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 626-29 (1943).\nSome students refused to salute, believing as Jehovah’s Witnesses “that the obligation\nimposed by law of God is superior to that of laws enacted by temporal government.” Id. at\n629. They looked for authority in the Bible, Book of Exodus, Chapter 20, verses 4 and 5:\n“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in\nheaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou\nshalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nJehovah’s Witnesses considered “the flag is an ‘image’ within this command,” which they\nwere bound by God not to salute. Id.\n\n{82} In a ringing endorsement of the First Amendment, the United States Supreme Court\nstruck down the West Virginia statute, noting the irony of the state’s position: “To sustain\nthe compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the\nindividual’s right to speak his own mind, left it open to public authorities to compel him to\nutter what is not in his mind.” Id. at 634. And again, “[i]f there is any fixed star in our\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be\northodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to\nconfess by word or act their faith therein.” Id. at 642. In his concurrence, Justice Black had\nthis to add:\n\n                                              27\n\f       The Jehovah’s Witnesses, without any desire to show disrespect for either the\n       flag or the country, interpret the Bible as commanding, at the risk of God’s\n       displeasure, that they not go through the form of a pledge of allegiance to any\n       flag. The devoutness of their belief is evidenced by their willingness to\n       suffer persecution and punishment, rather than make the pledge.\n\nId. at 643 (Black, J., concurring). Considering the times, the Barnette opinion stands today\nas an act of the utmost courage; it represents one of the Court’s finest moments.\n\n{83} Jonathan and Elaine Huguenin see themselves in much the same position as the\nstudents in Barnette. As devout, practicing Christians, they believe, as a matter of faith, that\ncertain commands of the Bible are not left open to secular interpretation; they are meant to\nbe obeyed. Among those commands, according to the Huguenins, is an injunction against\nsame-sex marriage. On the record before us, no one has questioned the Huguenin’s\ndevoutness or their sincerity; their religious convictions deserve our respect. In the words\nof their legal counsel, the Huguenins “believed that creating photographs telling the story\nof that event [a same-sex wedding] would express a message contrary to their sincerely held\nbeliefs, and that doing so would disobey God.” If honoring same-sex marriage would so\nconflict with their fundamental religious tenets, no less than the Jehovah’s Witnesses in\nBarnette, how then, they ask, can the State of New Mexico compel them to “disobey God”\nin this case? How indeed?\n\n{84} Twenty-four years later, during the zenith of the Civil Rights era, the Supreme Court\nprovided a partial answer. In Loving v. Virginia, the State of Virginia, like sixteen similarly\nsituated states with miscegenation laws, prohibited marriage between the white and black\nraces, making it a crime punishable by imprisonment. 388 U.S. 1, 4, 6 (1967). Such laws\narose as an incident of slavery and were common in Virginia and elsewhere since early\ntimes. Id. at 6. The Lovings, an interracial couple, had been lawfully married elsewhere and\nwanted to live openly as husband and wife in Virginia. Id. at 2-3. For their honesty, they\nwere prosecuted and convicted; their prison sentences were suspended on condition that they\nleave Virginia and not return for 25 years. Id. at 3. The Virginia trial judge, in justifying\nthe convictions, drew strength from his view of the Bible:\n\n       “Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he\n       placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with this\n       arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he\n       separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.”\n\nId. at 3. Whatever opinion one might have of the trial judge’s religious views, which\nmirrored those of millions of Americans of the time, no one questioned his sincerity either\nor his religious conviction. In affirming the Lovings’ convictions, Virginia’s highest court\nobserved the religious, cultural, historical and moral roots that justified miscegenation laws.\nSee id.\n\n\n                                              28\n\f{85} The Supreme Court struck down Virginia’s miscegenation statute. Id. at 11-12.\nObserving that “[t]he freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal\nrights essential in the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men,” the Court held categorically\nthat “[t]here can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial\nclassifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 12. State\nlaws, even those religiously inspired, may not discriminate invidiously on the basis of race.\n\n{86} There is a lesson here. In a constitutional form of government, personal, religious,\nand moral beliefs, when acted upon to the detriment of someone else’s rights, have\nconstitutional limits. One is free to believe, think and speak as one’s conscience, or God,\ndictates. But when actions, even religiously inspired, conflict with other constitutionally\nprotected rights—in Loving the right to be free from invidious racial discrimination—then\nthere must be some accommodation. Recall that Barnette was all about the students; their\nexercise of First Amendment rights did not infringe upon anyone else. The Huguenins\ncannot make that claim. Their refusal to do business with the same-sex couple in this case,\nno matter how religiously inspired, was an affront to the legal rights of that couple, the right\ngranted them under New Mexico law to engage in the commercial marketplace free from\ndiscrimination.\n\n{87} But of course, the Huguenins are not trying to prohibit anyone from marrying. They\nonly want to be left alone to conduct their photography business in a manner consistent with\ntheir moral convictions. In their view, they seek only the freedom not to endorse someone\nelse’s lifestyle. Loving, therefore, does not completely answer the question the Huguenins\npose. To complete the circle, we turn to our third case.\n\n{88} Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, upheld the federal Civil Rights Act of\n1964, a milestone enactment which, among other achievements, declared invidious\ndiscrimination unlawful, not just by the state but by private citizens, when providing goods\nand services in the sphere of public accommodations. 379 U.S. 241, 246, 261-62 (1964).\nThe Act declared: “‘All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of\npublic accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on\nthe ground of race, color, religion or national origin.’” Id. at 247. A watershed achievement,\nthe Act vindicated nearly a century of frustrated effort to fulfill the promise of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, to end not only slavery but all of its traces as well. See id. at 244-46. And\nending second-class citizenship, being denied a seat in a restaurant or a room in an\ninn—purely on the basis of one’s race or religion—was a goal that drove the passage of the\nAct. See id. at 252-53.\n\n{89} By the time of the success of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, many states had already\npassed their own public accommodation laws. See id. at 358-59 (noting that thirty-two states\nalready had public accommodation laws); see also Lisa Gabrielle & Annette K. Sanderson,\nDiscrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey of State and Federal Public\nAccommodations Laws, 7 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 215, 240 (1978) (recognizing that\n\n                                               29\n\f“the existence of numerous state laws facilitated Congress’ acceptance of Title II” of the\nCivil Rights Act). Today, many states have Human Rights Acts similar to New Mexico’s.\nSee, e.g., 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-102(A) (2010); Iowa Code Ann. § 216.7 (2007); Md.\nCode Ann., State Government § 20-304 (2009); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 651.070 (2011).\nPublic accommodations have been expanded to preclude invidious discrimination in most\nevery public business, including the Huguenin’s photography business. Prohibited\nclassifications have been enlarged from the historical classes—race, religion, gender,\nnational origin—to include sexual orientation. See, e.g., Douglas NeJaime, Marriage\nInequality: Same-Sex Relationships, Religious Exemptions, and the Production of Sexual\nOrientation Discrimination, 100 Cal. L. Rev. 1169, 1190 (2012) (“Twenty-one states and\nthe District of Columbia cover sexual orientation in their antidiscrimination laws governing\nemployment, housing, and public accommodations.”). The New Mexico Legislature has\nmade it clear that to discriminate in business on the basis of sexual orientation is just as\nintolerable as discrimination directed toward race, color, national origin or religion. See\nNMSA 1978, § 28-1-7(F) (2004). The Huguenins today can no more turn away customers\non the basis of sexual orientation—photographing a same-sex marriage ceremony—than\nthey could refuse to photograph African-Americans or Muslims.\n\n{90} All of which, I assume, is little comfort to the Huguenins, who now are compelled\nby law to compromise the very religious beliefs that inspire their lives. Though the rule of\nlaw requires it, the result is sobering. It will no doubt leave a tangible mark on the\nHuguenins and others of similar views.\n\n{91} On a larger scale, this case provokes reflection on what this nation is all about, its\npromise of fairness, liberty, equality of opportunity, and justice. At its heart, this case\nteaches that at some point in our lives all of us must compromise, if only a little, to\naccommodate the contrasting values of others. A multicultural, pluralistic society, one of\nour nation’s strengths, demands no less. The Huguenins are free to think, to say, to believe,\nas they wish; they may pray to the God of their choice and follow those commandments in\ntheir personal lives wherever they lead. The Constitution protects the Huguenins in that\nrespect and much more. But there is a price, one that we all have to pay somewhere in our\ncivic life.\n\n{92} In the smaller, more focused world of the marketplace, of commerce, of public\naccommodation, the Huguenins have to channel their conduct, not their beliefs, so as to leave\nspace for other Americans who believe something different. That compromise is part of the\nglue that holds us together as a nation, the tolerance that lubricates the varied moving parts\nof us as a people. That sense of respect we owe others, whether or not we believe as they\ndo, illuminates this country, setting it apart from the discord that afflicts much of the rest of\nthe world. In short, I would say to the Huguenins, with the utmost respect: it is the price of\ncitizenship. I therefore concur.\n\n                                                ____________________________________\n                                                RICHARD C.

Elane Photography, which does not contest its public accommodation status\nunder the NMHRA, offers wedding photography services to the general public and posts its\nphotographs on a password-protected website for its customers. In this case, Elane\nPhotography refused to photograph a commitment ceremony between two women. The\nquestions presented are (1) whether Elane Photography violated the NMHRA when it\nrefused to photograph the commitment ceremony, and if so, (2) whether this application of\nthe NMHRA violates either the Free Speech or the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, or (3) whether this application violates the\nNew Mexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act (NMRFRA), NMSA 1978, §§ 28-22-1 to\n-5 (2000).\n\n{2}      First, we conclude that a commercial photography business that offers its services\nto the public, thereby increasing its visibility to potential clients, is subject to the\nantidiscrimination provisions of the NMHRA and must serve same-sex couples on the same\nbasis that it serves opposite-sex couples. Therefore, when Elane Photography refused to\nphotograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, it violated the NMHRA in the same way as\nif it had refused to photograph a wedding between people of different races.\n\n{3}    Second, we conclude that the NMHRA does not violate free speech guarantees\n\n                                            3\n\fbecause the NMHRA does not compel Elane Photography to either speak a government-\nmandated message or to publish the speech of another. The purpose of the NMHRA is to\nensure that businesses offering services to the general public do not discriminate against\nprotected classes of people, and the United States Supreme Court has made it clear that the\nFirst Amendment permits such regulation by states. Businesses that choose to be public\naccommodations must comply with the NMHRA, although such businesses retain their First\nAmendment rights to express their religious or political beliefs. They may, for example, post\na disclaimer on their website or in their studio advertising that they oppose same-sex\nmarriage but that they comply with applicable antidiscrimination laws. We also hold that\nthe NMHRA is a neutral law of general applicability, and as such, it does not violate the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n{4}   Finally, we hold that the NMRFRA is inapplicable in this case because the\ngovernment is not a party. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n{5}     The NMHRA prohibits, among other things, discriminatory practices against certain\ndefined classes of people. See § 28-1-7. In 2003, the NMHRA was amended to add “sexual\norientation” as a class of persons protected from discriminatory treatment. 2003 N.M. Laws,\nch. 383, § 2. “Sexual orientation” is defined in the NMHRA as “heterosexuality,\nhomosexuality or bisexuality, whether actual or perceived.” Section 28-1-2(P). In this case,\nwe are concerned with discrimination by a public accommodation against a person because\nof that person’s real or perceived homosexuality—that person’s propensity to experience\nfeelings of attraction and romantic love for other members of the same sex.\n\n{6}     “Public accommodation” is defined in the NMHRA as “any establishment that\nprovides or offers its services, facilities, accommodations or goods to the public, but does\nnot include a bona fide private club or other place or establishment that is by its nature and\nuse distinctly private.” Section 28-1-2(H). Thus, a business that elects not to offer its goods\nor services to the public is not subject to the NMHRA.\n\n{7}    Vanessa Willock contacted Elane Photography, LLC, by e-mail to inquire about\nElane Photography’s services and to determine whether it would be available to photograph\nher commitment ceremony1 to another woman. Elane Photography’s co-owner and lead\nphotographer, Elaine Huguenin, is personally opposed to same-sex marriage and will not\n\n\n       1\n         Willock referred to the event as a “commitment ceremony” in her e-mail to Elane\nPhotography. However, the parties agree that the ceremony was essentially a\nwedding—Elane Photography emphasizes that there were vows, rings, a minister, flower\ngirls, and a wedding dress, and Willock uses the word “wedding” to describe the ceremony\nin her brief. We use the terms “wedding” and “commitment ceremony” interchangeably.\n\n                                              4\n\fphotograph any image or event that violates her religious beliefs. Huguenin responded to\nWillock that Elane Photography photographed only “traditional weddings.” Willock e-\nmailed back and asked, “Are you saying that your company does not offer your photography\nservices to same-sex couples?” Huguenin responded, “Yes, you are correct in saying we do\nnot photograph same-sex weddings,” and thanked Willock for her interest.\n\n{8}     In order to verify Elane Photography’s policy, Willock’s partner, Misti Collinsworth,\ne-mailed Elane Photography and inquired about its willingness to photograph a wedding,\nwithout mentioning the sexes of the participants. Huguenin sent Collinsworth a list of\npricing information and an invitation to meet with her and discuss her services. A few weeks\nlater, Huguenin again e-mailed Collinsworth to follow up.\n\n{9}     Willock filed a discrimination complaint against Elane Photography with the New\nMexico Human Rights Commission for discriminating against her based on her sexual\norientation in violation of the NMHRA. The Commission concluded that Elane Photography\nhad discriminated against Willock in violation of Section 28-1-7(F), which prohibits\ndiscrimination by public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation, among other\nprotected classifications. It awarded Willock attorneys’ fees, which Willock later waived.\nNo other monetary or injunctive relief was granted.\n\n{10} Elane Photography appealed to the Second Judicial District Court for a trial de novo\npursuant to Section 28-1-13(A). See NMSA 1978, § 39-3-1 (1955) (“All appeals from\ninferior tribunals to the district courts shall be tried anew in said courts on their merits, as\nif no trial had been had below, except as otherwise provided by law.”). Elane Photography\nsought a reversal of the award of attorneys’ fees, a declaratory judgment that it had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, and a ruling that its rights had been violated,\namong other relief. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district\ncourt granted summary judgment for Willock. Elane Photography again appealed, and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 2012-NMCA-086, ¶ 1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. We granted certiorari.\n\n{11} Elane Photography argues before this Court that: (1) it did not discriminate on the\nbasis of sexual orientation, and therefore it did not violate the NMHRA; or, alternatively, (2)\nby requiring Elane Photography to accept clients against its will, the NMHRA violates the\nprotection of the First Amendment against compelled speech; (3) the NMHRA violates\nElane Photography’s First Amendment right to freely exercise its religion; and (4) the\nNMHRA violates Elane Photography’s right under the NMRFRA to freely exercise its\nreligion. For the reasons that follow, we reject Elane Photography’s arguments and affirm\nsummary judgment for Willock.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n{12} The parties agree on the facts in this case, and the only question for this Court to\nconsider is whether Willock is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

United\n\n                                               5\n\fParcel Serv., Inc., 1998-NMSC-046, ¶ 6, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1344671\"><a href=\"/opinion/1344671/self-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1344671\"><a href=\"/opinion/1344671/self-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“Summary judgment\nis appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law.”).

ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY REFUSED TO SERVE WILLOCK ON THE\n        BASIS OF HER SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN VIOLATION OF THE NMHRA\n\n{13} The NMHRA seeks to promote the equal rights of people within certain specified\nclasses by protecting them against discriminatory treatment. See Juneau v. Intel Corp.,\n2006-NMSC-002, ¶ 14, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510361\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510361/juneau-v-intel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510361\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510361/juneau-v-intel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“The NMHRA protects against\ndiscriminatory treatment . . . .”). To accomplish this goal, the NMHRA makes it unlawful\nfor “any person in any public accommodation to make a distinction, directly or indirectly,\nin offering or refusing to offer its services, facilities, accommodations or goods to any person\nbecause of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender\nidentity, spousal affiliation or physical or mental handicap.” Section 28-1-7(F) (emphasis\nadded). The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s holding that Elane Photography\nwas a public accommodation under Section 28-1-2(H), Elane Photography, 2012-NMCA-\n086, ¶ 18, and Elane Photography did not challenge that holding in this appeal. Accordingly,\nElane Photography waived its right to challenge that conclusion as a matter of New Mexico\nlaw. See Fikes v. Furst, 2003-NMSC-033, ¶ 8, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623414\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623414/fikes-v-furst/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623414\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623414/fikes-v-furst/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“[I]t is improper\nfor this Court to consider any questions except those set forth in the petition for certiorari.”).\nWe therefore accept the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that at the time of its interactions with\nWillock and Collinsworth, Elane Photography was a public accommodation as defined in\nSection 28-1-2(H), and as such, was subject to Section 28-1-7(F) of the NMHRA. See Elane\nPhotography, 2012-NMCA-086, ¶¶ 14, 18.\n\n{14} Elane Photography argues that it did not violate the NMHRA because it did not\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation when it refused service to Willock. Instead,\nElane Photography explains that it “did not want to convey through [Huguenin]’s pictures\nthe story of an event celebrating an understanding of marriage that conflicts with [the\nowners’] beliefs.” Elane Photography argues that it would have taken portrait photographs\nand performed other services for same-sex customers, so long as they did not request\nphotographs that involved or endorsed same-sex weddings. However, Elane Photograph’s\nowners testified that they would also have refused to take photos of same-sex couples in\nother contexts, including photos of a couple holding hands or showing affection for each\nother. Elane Photography also argues in its brief that it would have turned away\nheterosexual customers if the customers asked for photographs in a context that endorsed\nsame-sex marriage. For example, Elane Photography states that it “would have declined the\nrequest even if the ceremony was part of a movie and the actors playing the same-sex couple\nwere heterosexual.” Therefore, Elane Photography reasons that it did not discriminate\n“because of . . . sexual orientation,” § 28-1-7(F), but because it did not wish to endorse\nWillock’s and Collinsworth’s wedding.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f{15} The NMHRA prohibits discrimination in broad terms by forbidding “any person in\nany public accommodation to make a distinction, directly or indirectly, in offering or\nrefusing to offer its services . . . because of . . . sexual orientation.” Section 28-1-7(F)\n(emphasis added). Elane Photography is primarily a wedding photography business. It\nprovides wedding photography services to heterosexual couples, but it refuses to work with\nhomosexual couples under equivalent circumstances.\n\n{16} Elane Photography’s argument is an attempt to distinguish between an individual’s\nstatus of being homosexual and his or her conduct in openly committing to a person of the\nsame sex. It was apparently Willock’s e-mail request to have Elane Photography photograph\nWillock’s commitment ceremony to another woman that signaled Willock’s sexual\norientation to Elane Photography, regardless of whether that assessment was real or merely\nperceived. The difficulty in distinguishing between status and conduct in the context of\nsexual orientation discrimination is that people may base their judgment about an\nindividual’s sexual orientation on the individual’s conduct. To allow discrimination based\non conduct so closely correlated with sexual orientation would severely undermine the\npurpose of the NMHRA.\n\n{17} The United States Supreme Court has rejected similar attempts to distinguish\nbetween a protected status and conduct closely correlated with that status. In Christian\nLegal Society Chapter of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law v.\nMartinez, ___ U.S. ___, ___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150544\"><a href=\"/opinion/150544/christian-legal-soc-chapter-of-univ-of-cal-hastings-college-of-law-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We agree that when a law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, that\nlaw similarly protects conduct that is inextricably tied to sexual orientation. Otherwise we\nwould interpret the NMHRA as protecting same-gender couples against discriminatory\ntreatment, but only to the extent that they do not openly display their same-gender sexual\norientation.\n\n{18} In this case, we see no basis for distinguishing between discrimination based on\nsexual orientation and discrimination based on someone’s conduct of publicly committing\nto a person of the same sex. Our role is to determine and follow the intent of the Legislature,\nState v. Hall, 2013-NMSC-001, ¶ 9, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and the NMHRA evinces a clear intent\nto prevent discrimination as it is broadly defined in Section 28-1-7(F). New Mexico has a\nstrong state policy of promoting equality for its residents regardless of sexual orientation.\nSee Section 28-1-7 (defining unlawful discriminatory practices); NMSA 1978, § 29-21-2\n(2009) (prohibiting profiling by law enforcement on the basis of sexual orientation); NMSA\n1978, § 31-18B-2(D) (2007) (including sexual orientation as a protected status under the\nHate Crimes Act); Chatterjee v.

As a matter of New\nMexico law, the NMHRA prohibits a public accommodation from refusing to serve a client\nbased on sexual orientation, and Elane Photography violated the law by refusing to\nphotograph Willock’s same-sex commitment ceremony.\n\n{19} We are not persuaded by Elane Photography’s argument that it does not violate the\nNMHRA because it will photograph a gay person (for example, in single-person portraits)\nso long as the photographs do not reflect the client’s sexual preferences. The NMHRA\nprohibits public accommodations from making any distinction in the services they offer to\ncustomers on the basis of protected classifications. Section 28-1-7(F). For example, if a\nrestaurant offers a full menu to male customers, it may not refuse to serve entrees to women,\neven if it will serve them appetizers. The NMHRA does not permit businesses to offer a\n“limited menu” of goods or services to customers on the basis of a status that fits within one\nof the protected categories. Therefore, Elane Photography’s willingness to offer some\nservices to Willock does not cure its refusal to provide other services that it offered to the\ngeneral public. Similarly, it does not help Elane Photography to argue that it would have\nturned away heterosexual polygamous weddings or heterosexual persons pretending to have\na same-sex wedding. Those situations are not at issue here, and, if anything, these arguments\nsupport a finding that Elane Photography intended to discriminate against Willock based on\nher same-sex sexual orientation. Therefore, we hold that Elane Photography discriminated\nagainst Willock on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of the NMHRA.\n\nII.    THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY’S FIRST\n       AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n\n{20}   Elane Photography challenges enforcement of the NMHRA on the grounds that\n\n                                              8\n\fenforcement of the law violates its right to free speech and the free exercise of its religion\nunder the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons that follow,\nwe reject both of these arguments.\n\nA.     THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY’S FREE\n       SPEECH RIGHTS\n\n{21} Specifically regarding its free speech rights, Elane Photography argues that the\nNMHRA compels it to speak in violation of the First Amendment by requiring it to\nphotograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, even though it is against the owners’\npersonal beliefs. We disagree.\n\n{22} The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “Congress shall\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I. This prohibition\napplies equally to state governments. Gitlow v. New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100708\"><a href=\"/opinion/100708/gitlow-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1925)\n(assuming without deciding that free speech and press rights are incorporated by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); Edwards v.

United States Supreme Court precedent makes it clear that the right to speak freely\nincludes the right to refrain from speaking. See, e.g., Wooley v. Maynard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109638\"><a href=\"/opinion/109638/wooley-v-maynard/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714\n(1977) (“[T]he right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state\naction includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.”).\n\n{23} Elane Photography observes that photography is an expressive art form and that\nphotographs can fall within the constitutional protections of free speech. See Hurley v. Irish-\nAm. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117960\"><a href=\"/opinion/117960/hurley-v-irish-american-gay-lesbian-and-bisexual-group-of-boston-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569 (1995) (observing that\nabstract art and instrumental music are “unquestionably shielded” by the First Amendment).\nElane Photography also states that in the course of its business, it creates and edits\nphotographs for its clients so as to tell a positive story about each wedding it photographs,\nand the company and its owners would prefer not to send a positive message about same-sex\nweddings or same-sex marriage. Elane Photography concludes that by requiring it to\nphotograph same-sex weddings on the same basis that it photographs opposite-sex weddings,\nthe NMHRA unconstitutionally compels it to “create and engage in expression” that sends\na positive message about same-sex marriage not shared by its owner.\n\n{24} The compelled-speech doctrine on which Elane Photography relies is comprised of\ntwo lines of cases. The first line of cases establishes the proposition that the government\nmay not require an individual to “speak the government’s message.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for\nAcademic & Institutional Rights, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-rights-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (2006). The second line of cases\nprohibits the government from requiring a private actor “to host or accommodate another\nspeaker’s message.” Id. Elane Photography argues that by requiring it to photograph same-\nsex weddings on the same basis as opposite-sex weddings, the NMHRA violates both\nprohibitions. We address each argument in turn.\n\n                                               9\n\f1.     The NMHRA does not compel Elane Photography to speak the government’s\n       message\n\n{25} The right to refrain from speaking was established in West Virginia State Board of\nEducation v. Barnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (1943), in which the United States Supreme Court\nheld that the State of West Virginia could not constitutionally require students to salute the\nAmerican flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The Court held that a state could not\nrequire “affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind,” id. at 633, and that the state had\nimpermissibly “invade[d] the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First\nAmendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official control,” id. at 642.\n\n{26} Similarly, in Wooley, 430 U.S. at 717, the United States Supreme Court held that the\nState of New Hampshire could not constitutionally punish a man for covering the state motto\non the license plate of his car. The Wooley plaintiffs considered “Live Free or Die,” the state\nmotto, “repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs,” id. at 707, and they raised\na First Amendment challenge to the state’s law forbidding residents to hide or alter the\nmotto. Id. at 709, 713. The Wooley Court framed the question presented as “whether the\nState may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an\nideological message by displaying it on his [or her] private property in a manner and for the\nexpress purpose that it be observed and read by the public” and concluded that the measure\nwas unconstitutional. Id. at 713.\n\n{27} Elane Photography reads Wooley and Barnette to mean that the government may not\ncompel people “to engage in unwanted expression.” However, the cases themselves are\nnarrower than Elane Photography suggests; they involve situations in which the speakers\nwere compelled to publicly “speak the government’s message.” Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 63.\nIn Wooley and Barnette, the respective states impermissibly required their residents to affirm\nor display a specific government-selected message: “Live Free or Die” in Wooley, 430 U.S.\nat 707, and allegiance to the flag in Barnette, 319 U.S. at 632-33. Both cases stand for the\nproposition that the First Amendment does not permit the government to “prescribe what\nshall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force\ncitizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” Barnette, 319 U.S. at 642. However,\nunlike the laws at issue in Wooley and Barnette, the NMHRA does not require Elane\nPhotography to recite or display any message. It does not even require Elane Photography\nto take photographs. The NMHRA only mandates that if Elane Photography operates a\nbusiness as a public accommodation, it cannot discriminate against potential clients based\non their sexual orientation.\n\n{28} Furthermore, the laws at issue in Wooley and Barnette had little purpose other than\nto promote the government-sanctioned message. See Wooley, 430 U.S. at 716-17 (rejecting\nthe state’s contentions that (1) the state motto made it easier for law enforcement to identify\nimproper license plates, and (2) the state hoped “to communicate to others an official view\nas to proper appreciation of history, state pride, and individualism”); Barnette, 319 U.S. at\n640 (identifying “national unity” as the goal of compulsory flag salutes) (internal quotation\n\n                                              10\n\fmarks and citation omitted). The Barnette Court noted that the dissenting students’ choice\nnot to salute the flag “[did] not bring them into collision with rights asserted by any other\nindividual.” 319 U.S. at 630. That is not the case here, where Elane Photography’s asserted\nright not to serve same-sex couples directly conflicts with Willock’s right under Section 28-\n1-7(F) of the NMHRA to obtain goods and services from a public accommodation without\ndiscrimination on the basis of her sexual orientation. Antidiscrimination laws have\nimportant purposes that go beyond expressing government values: they ensure that services\nare freely available in the market, and they protect individuals from humiliation and\ndignitary harm. See Daniel v. Paul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107955\"><a href=\"/opinion/107955/daniel-v-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307-08 (1969) (stating that the purpose\nof Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was “to [re]move the daily affront and humiliation\ninvolved in discriminatory denials of access to facilities ostensibly open to the general\npublic”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Katzenbach v.

Elane Photography’s argument here\nis more analogous to the claims raised by the law schools in Rumsfeld. In that case, a federal\nlaw made universities’ federal funding contingent on the universities allowing military\nrecruiters access to university facilities and services on the same basis as other, non-military\nrecruiters. 547 U.S. at 52-53. A group of law schools that objected to the ban on gays in the\nmilitary challenged the law on a number of constitutional grounds, including that the law in\nquestion compelled them to speak the government’s message. Id. at 52, 53, 61-62. In order\nto assist the military recruiters, schools had to provide services that involved speech, “such\nas sending e-mails and distributing flyers.” Id. at 60.\n\n{30} The United States Supreme Court held that this requirement did not constitute\ncompelled speech. Id. at 62. The Court observed that the federal law “neither limits what\nlaw schools may say nor requires them to say anything.” Id. at 60. Schools were compelled\nonly to provide the type of speech-related services to military recruiters that they provided\nto non-military recruiters. Id. at 62. “There [was] nothing . . . approaching a\nGovernment-mandated pledge or motto that the school [had to] endorse.” Id.\n\n{31} The same situation is true in the instant case. Like the law in Rumsfeld, the NMHRA\ndoes not require any affirmation of belief by regulated public accommodations; instead, it\nrequires businesses that offer services to the public at large to provide those services without\nregard for race, sex, sexual orientation, or other protected classifications. Section 28-1-7(F).\nThe fact that these services may involve speech or other expressive services does not render\nthe NMHRA unconstitutional. See Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 62 (“The compelled speech to\nwhich the law schools point is plainly incidental to the [law’s] regulation of conduct, and it\nhas never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of\nconduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out\n\n                                              11\n\fby means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.” (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)). Elane Photography is compelled to take photographs of same-sex\nweddings only to the extent that it would provide the same services to a heterosexual couple.\nSee id. at 62 (speech assisting military recruiters was “only ‘compelled’ if, and to the extent,\nthe school provide[d] such speech for other recruiters”).\n\n2.     The NMHRA does not compel Elane Photography to host or accommodate the\n       message of another speaker\n\na.     State laws prohibiting discrimination by public accommodations do not constitute\n       compelled speech\n\n{32} The second line of compelled-speech cases deals with situations in which a\ngovernment entity has required a speaker to “host or accommodate another speaker’s\nmessage.” Id. at 63. Elane Photography argues that a same-sex wedding or commitment\nceremony is an expressive event, and that by requiring it to accept a client who is having a\nsame-sex wedding, the NMHRA compels it to facilitate the messages inherent in that event.\nElane Photography argues that there are two messages conveyed by a same-sex wedding or\ncommitment ceremony: first, that such ceremonies exist, and second, that these occasions\ndeserve celebration and approval. Elane Photography does not wish to convey either of these\nmessages.\n\n{33} The United States Supreme Court has never found a compelled-speech violation\narising from the application of antidiscrimination laws to a for-profit public accommodation.\nIn fact, it has suggested that public accommodation laws are generally constitutional. See\nHurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (“Provisions like these are well within the State’s usual power to\nenact when a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the target of\ndiscrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate the First or Fourteenth\nAmendments . . . . [T]he focal point of [such statutes is] rather on the act of discriminating\nagainst individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and services on\nthe proscribed grounds.”). The United States Supreme Court has found constitutional\nproblems with some applications of state public accommodation laws, but those problems\nhave arisen when states have applied their public accommodation laws to free-speech events\nsuch as privately organized parades, id. at 566, 573, 580-81, and private membership\norganizations, Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659, 659 n.4 (2000).2 Elane\nPhotography, however, is an ordinary public accommodation, a “clearly commercial\nentit[y],” id. at 657, that sells goods and services to the public.\n\n{34} The NMHRA does not, nor could it, regulate the content of the photographs that\nElane Photography produces. It does not, for example, mandate that Elane Photography take\n\n\n       2\n       Dale also was decided on freedom of association grounds. Id. at 644. Elane\nPhotography has not argued that its right of expressive association was violated.\n\n                                              12\n\fposed photographs rather than candid shots, nor does it require every wedding album to\ncontain a picture of the bride’s bouquet. Indeed, the NMHRA does not mandate that Elane\nPhotography choose to take wedding pictures; that is the exclusive choice of Elane\nPhotography. Like all public accommodation laws, the NMHRA regulates “the act of\ndiscriminating against individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges,\nand services on the proscribed grounds.” See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (describing the\nMassachusetts public accommodation law). Elane Photography argues that because the\nservice it provides is photography, and because photography is expressive, “some of [the]\nimages will inevitably express the messages inherent in [the] event.” In essence, then, Elane\nPhotography argues that by limiting its ability to choose its clients, the NMHRA forces it to\nproduce photographs expressing its clients’ messages even when the messages are contrary\nto Elane Photography’s beliefs.\n\n{35} Elane Photography has misunderstood this issue. It believes that because it is a\nphotography business, it cannot be subject to public accommodation laws. The reality is that\nbecause it is a public accommodation, its provision of services can be regulated, even though\nthose services include artistic and creative work. If Elane Photography took photographs on\nits own time and sold them at a gallery, or if it was hired by certain clients but did not offer\nits services to the general public, the law would not apply to Elane Photography’s choice of\nwhom to photograph or not. The difference in the present case is that the photographs that\nare allegedly compelled by the NMHRA are photographs that Elane Photography produces\nfor hire in the ordinary course of its business as a public accommodation. This\ndetermination has no relation to the artistic merit of photographs produced by Elane\nPhotography. If Annie Leibovitz or Peter Lindbergh worked as public accommodations in\nNew Mexico, they would be subject to the provisions of the NMHRA. Unlike the\ndefendants in Hurley or the other cases in which the United States Supreme Court has found\ncompelled-speech violations, Elane Photography sells its expressive services to the public.\nIt may be that Elane Photography expresses its clients’ messages in its photographs, but only\nbecause it is hired to do so. The NMHRA requires that Elane Photography perform the same\nservices for a same-sex couple as it would for an opposite-sex couple; the fact that these\nservices require photography stems from the nature of Elane Photography’s chosen line of\nbusiness.\n\n{36} The cases in which the United States Supreme Court found that the government\nunconstitutionally required a speaker to host or accommodate another speaker’s message are\ndistinctly different because they involve direct government interference with the speaker’s\nown message, as opposed to a message-for-hire. In two cases, the Court found a compelled-\nspeech problem where the government explicitly required a publisher to distribute an\nopposing point of view. In the first of these cases, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109088\"><a href=\"/opinion/109088/miami-herald-publishing-co-v-tornillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (1974), the United States Supreme Court invalidated Florida’s “‘right of\nreply’” statute. The law provided that if a candidate for public office was criticized in a\nFlorida newspaper, the candidate could demand that the newspaper print his or her reply,\nfree of cost, in as conspicuous a location as the criticism that had appeared. Id. The Court\nexpressed concern that the statute might deter editors from printing criticism of candidates,\n\n                                              13\n\fthereby chilling political news coverage and commentary in the state. Id. at 257.\nFurthermore, the statute unconstitutionally wrested control over editorial decisions about\n“[t]he choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on\nthe size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials” away\nfrom the editors and into the hands of the state. Id. at 258.\n\n{37} Similarly, in Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111596\"><a href=\"/opinion/111596/pacific-gas-elec-co-v-public-util-commn-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4, 20-21, 26 (1986) (plurality opinion; Marshall, J., concurring in judgment), a\nplurality of the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional a decision by the\nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission to allow a third-party group to send out messages\nwith a utility’s billing statements. The utility had traditionally distributed a newsletter to its\ncustomers with its monthly billing statements. Id. at 5 (plurality opinion). The Public Utility\nCommission decided that the space in the billing envelopes belonged to the customers, not\nto the utility, and it allowed an intervenor in a ratemaking proceeding involving the utility\nto send out messages in the utility’s billing envelopes four times per year. Id. at 5-6, 13\n(plurality opinion). Citing Tornillo, the United States Supreme Court held that this decision\nunconstitutionally compelled the utility to accommodate the intervenor’s speech. Pacific\nGas, 475 U.S. at 9-13 (plurality opinion). The Court noted that the Commission’s ruling\nrequired the utility to disseminate messages that were hostile to the utility’s own interests,\nid. at 14 (plurality opinion), and, depending on what the intervenors said, the utility might\n“be forced either to appear to agree with [the intervenors’] views or to respond,” when it\nwould have preferred to remain silent on an issue. Id. at 15 (plurality opinion).\n\n{38} In both Pacific Gas and Tornillo, the government commandeered a speaker’s means\nof reaching its audience and required the speaker to disseminate an opposing point of view.\nNothing analogous occurred in the present case. Elane Photography is not required to print\nthe names and addresses of rival photographers in its albums, nor does Elane Photography\ndistribute a newsletter in which the government has required it to print someone else’s ideas.\nInstead, the allegedly compelled message is Elane Photography’s own work on behalf of its\nclients, which it distributes only to its clients and their loved ones. The government has not\ninterfered with Elane Photography’s editorial judgment; the only choice regulated is Elane\nPhotography’s choice of clients.\n\n{39} In addition, although Elane Photography raises concerns that its speech will be\nchilled, there is no risk of a chilling effect in this case. In Tornillo, the “‘right of reply’”\nstatute could have discouraged newspapers from printing criticism of political candidates.\n418 U.S. at 257. By contrast, the relevant choice facing Elane Photography and similar\nbusinesses is not whether to publish a story, as in Tornillo, but whether to operate as a public\naccommodation. If a commercial photography business wishes to offer its services to the\npublic, thereby increasing its visibility to potential clients, it will be subject to the\nantidiscrimination provisions of the NMHRA. If a commercial photography business\nbelieves that the NMHRA stifles its creativity, it can remain in business, but it can cease to\noffer its services to the public at large. Elane Photography’s choice to offer its services to\nthe public is a business decision, not a decision about its freedom of speech.\n\n                                               14\n\f{40} In Pacific Gas and Tornillo, a government entity overtly required a speaker to\npublicize an opposing message. Elane Photography cites a third case, Hurley, in which the\ncompelled-speech violation was more subtle. In Hurley, 515 U.S. at 560-61, the private\norganizers of the Boston St. Patrick’s Day parade denied the application of a group of gay,\nlesbian, and bisexual Irish-Americans (known as GLIB) to march as a unit in the parade. Id.\nat 561. Massachusetts courts held that this constituted discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. Id. at 561, 563-64. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the\nparade did not discriminate against gay participants; instead, the issue was “the admission\nof GLIB as its own parade unit carrying its own banner,” which had unquestionable\nexpressive content. Id. at 572, 581.\n\n{41} Hurley is different from the instant case in two significant ways. First, the\nMassachusetts courts appear to have erroneously classified the privately organized parade\nas a public accommodation. See id. at 573 (“[T]he state courts’ application of the statute had\nthe effect of declaring the sponsors’ speech itself to be the public accommodation.”).\nSecond, parades by their nature express a message to the public. Id. at 568. By requiring\nthe parade organizers to include GLIB, the Massachusetts courts directly altered the\nexpressive content of the parade. Id. at 572-73. The presence of a group in a parade carries\nexpressive weight, and Hurley implicated associational rights as well as free-speech rights.\nId. at 565; see Dale, 530 U.S. at 659 (“Although we did not explicitly deem the parade in\nHurley an expressive association, the analysis we applied there is similar to the analysis we\napply here.”). Elane Photography argues that photographs are also inherently expressive,\nso Hurley must apply to this case as well. However, the NMHRA applies not to Elane\nPhotography’s photographs but to its business operation, and in particular, its business\ndecision not to offer its services to protected classes of people. While photography may be\nexpressive, the operation of a photography business is not. By way of analogy, the NMHRA\ncould not dictate which groups a parade organizer had to include. However, if a business\nsold parade-planning services, and that business operated as a public accommodation, the\nNMHRA would prohibit that business from refusing to offer parade-planning services to\npersons because of their sexual orientation. Thus, Elane Photography’s reliance on Hurley\nis misplaced.\n\n{42} Elane Photography’s situation is actually clearer than that of our hypothetical\nbusiness that organized parades, because even a parade for hire would still be a public event.\nSee id. at 568 (describing the public nature of parades and their dependence on parade-\nwatchers). By contrast, Elane Photography does not routinely publish for or display its\nwedding photographs to the public. Instead, it creates an album for each customer and posts\nthe photographs on a password-protected website for the customers and their friends and\nfamily to view. Whatever message Elane Photography’s photographs may express, they\nexpress that message only to the clients and their loved ones, not to the public.\n\n{43} We note that when Elane Photography displays its photographs publicly and on its\nown behalf, rather than for a client, such as in advertising, its choices of which photographs\nto display are entirely its own. The NMHRA does not require Elane Photography to either\n\n                                             15\n\finclude photographs of same-sex couples in its advertisements or display them in its studio.\nHowever, if Elane Photography offers its services to the public, the NMHRA requires Elane\nPhotography to provide those same services to clients who are members of a protected class\nunder the NMHRA.\n\nb.     Observers are unlikely to believe that Elane Photography’s photographs reflect the\n       views of either its owners or its employees\n\n{44} Elane Photography also argues that if it is compelled to photograph same-sex\nweddings, observers will believe that it and its owners approve of same-sex marriage. The\nUnited States Supreme Court incorporates the question of perceived endorsement into its\nanalysis in cases that involve compulsion to host or accommodate third-party speech. See,\ne.g., Hurley, 515 U.S. at 577 (“Without deciding on the precise significance of the likelihood\nof misattribution, it nonetheless becomes clear that in the context of an expressive parade\n. . . the parade’s overall message is distilled from the individual presentations along the way,\nand each unit’s expression is perceived by spectators as part of the whole.”). The Hurley\nCourt observed that admitting GLIB or any other organization into a parade would likely be\nperceived as a message from the parade organizers “that [GLIB’s] message was worthy of\npresentation and quite possibly of support as well.” Id. at 575. Therefore, the Court further\nobserved that the government’s forced inclusion of GLIB compromised the parade\norganizer’s “right to autonomy over [its] message.” Id. at 576.\n\n{45} In contrast to Pacific Gas and Tornillo, the United States Supreme Court has not\nfound compelled speech violations where the government has not explicitly required a\npublisher to disseminate opposing points of view and where observers are unlikely to\nmistake a person’s compliance with the law for endorsement of third-party messages, as in\nHurley. In Rumsfeld, the United States Supreme Court rejected not only the law schools’\nargument that they were forced to speak the government’s message, but also their argument\nthat they were required to host the recruiters’ speech in such a way that violated compelled\nspeech principles. 547 U.S. at 64-65 (“[The law schools’] accommodation of a military\nrecruiter’s message is not compelled speech because the accommodation does not\nsufficiently interfere with any message of the school.”). The law schools in Rumsfeld\nworried that “treat[ing] military and nonmilitary recruiters alike . . . could be viewed as\nsending the message that they see nothing wrong with the military’s policies [regarding gays\nin the military], when they do.” Id. The Rumsfeld Court held that students “can appreciate\nthe difference between speech a school sponsors and speech the school permits because\nlegally required to do so,” and that the law schools were free to express their disagreement\nwith the military’s policy. Id. at 65.\n\n{46} Rumsfeld drew on earlier cases that had considered whether observers would conflate\nthe speech of third parties with the opinions of the parties to the suit. In PruneYard\nShopping Center v. Robins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110292\"><a href=\"/opinion/110292/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76-78 (1980), a California shopping center was\nsued under a California constitutional provision that required privately owned shopping\ncenters to allow individuals to engage in expressive activities on their premises. The\n\n                                              16\n\fshopping center argued that the state could not constitutionally compel it “to participate in\nthe dissemination of an ideological message.” Id. at 86-87. The United States Supreme\nCourt rejected the argument, id. at 88, holding that because the shopping center was a\nbusiness establishment that was open to the public, “[t]he views expressed by members of\nthe public in passing out pamphlets or seeking signatures for a petition . . . will not likely be\nidentified with those of the owner.” Id. at 87. The Court also noted that the government had\nnot dictated any particular message or engaged in viewpoint discrimination, and that the\nshopping center could disavow the third-party messages by posting its own signs. Id. “Such\nsigns, for example, could disclaim any sponsorship of the message and could explain that\nthe persons are communicating their own messages by virtue of state law.” Id.\n\n{47} Elane Photography makes an argument very similar to one rejected by the Rumsfeld\nCourt: by treating customers alike, regardless of whether they are having same-sex or\nopposite-sex weddings, Elane Photography is concerned that it will send the message that\nit sees nothing wrong with same-sex marriage. Reasonable observers are unlikely to\ninterpret Elane Photography’s photographs as an endorsement of the photographed events.\nIt is well known to the public that wedding photographers are hired by paying customers and\nthat a photographer may not share the happy couple’s views on issues ranging from the\nminor (the color scheme, the hors d’oeuvres) to the decidedly major (the religious service,\nthe choice of bride or groom). As in Rumsfeld and PruneYard, Elane Photography is free\nto disavow, implicitly or explicitly, any messages that it believes the photographs convey.\nWe note that after Rumsfeld, many law schools published open letters expressing their\ncontinued opposition to military policies and military recruitment on campus. See, e.g.,\nDean’s Letter Regarding Military Recruiting on Campus & Faculty Letter Regarding\nMilitary             Recruitment,               Columbia             Law         School,\nhttp://web.law.columbia.edu/careers/military-recruiting-on-campus (last visited Aug. 9,\n2013); Military Recruitment Policy, University of Dayton School of Law,\nhttp://www.udayton.edu/law/career_services/military_recruitment_policy.php (last visited\nAug. 9, 2013); Employer Recruiting Policies and Guidelines, Harvard Law School,\nhttp://www.law.harvard.edu/current/careers/ocs/employers/recruiting-policies-\nemployers/index.html#Non-Discrimination (last visited Aug. 9, 2013). Elane Photography\nand its owners likewise retain their First Amendment rights to express their religious and\npolitical beliefs. They may, for example, post a disclaimer on their website or in their studio\nadvertising that they oppose same-sex marriage but that they comply with applicable\nantidiscrimination laws.\n\nc.      Elane Photography’s allocation of its work time does not raise First Amendment\n        concerns\n\n{48} Elane Photography next argues that when its employees spend time taking and\nediting photographs of same-sex weddings, they have less time to spend doing their\npreferred work of photographing opposite-sex weddings. Therefore, by Elane Photography’s\nreasoning, the state has interfered with Elane Photography’s message, just as it did in Pacific\nGas and Tornillo. In Tornillo, the newspaper had limited space to print its stories, and\n\n                                               17\n\fprinting replies by politicians took up space in which the newspaper could have published\nother material. 418 U.S. at 256-57. Similarly, the utility in Pacific Gas was required to\nshare the space inside its billing envelopes; when a third party used the space, the utility\ncould not distribute its own newsletter without paying additional postage. 475 U.S. at 5-6\n(plurality opinion). The instant case is different because Elane Photography does not\nproduce a publication whose limited space has been taken over by the government.\n\n{49} Instead, Elane Photography’s complaint is based on its staff’s limited time. Elane\nPhotography argues that if it accepts same-sex couples as clients, its employees must “spend\na day shooting pictures and three to four weeks selecting, editing, and arranging images” of\nthe clients’ weddings, when they would prefer to spend this time working on images of\nheterosexual weddings. Therefore, it argues, the NMHRA interferes with Elane\nPhotography’s own speech.\n\n{50} We disagree because the allocation of work time is a matter of personal preference,\nnot compelled speech, and it is not constitutionally protected. See Heart of Atlanta Motel,\nInc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (1964) (rejecting Thirteenth Amendment challenge\nto law requiring motel to serve African-American guests). By their nature, laws prohibiting\ndiscrimination in public accommodations require businesses and their employees to spend\ntime and energy serving customers whom they might prefer not to serve. See Hurley, 515\nU.S. at 578 (describing common law public accommodation rules as guaranteeing that\nindividuals “will not be turned away merely on the proprietor’s exercise of personal\npreference”). These laws apply even when the businesses provide skillful or physically\nintimate services. See Bragdon v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628-29 (1998) (applying public\naccommodations provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act to dental practice). This\nis the purpose of antidiscrimination laws: they force businesses to treat customers alike,\nregardless of their race, religion, or other protected status. These laws are necessary\nprecisely because some businesses would otherwise refuse to work with certain customers\nwhom the laws protect.\n\n{51} Antidiscrimination laws have been consistently upheld as constitutional. See, e.g.,\nHurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (“[Public accommodations laws] do not, as a general matter, violate\nthe First or Fourteenth Amendments.”); Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 242-44, 258, 261\n(sustaining Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against challenges based on the\nCommerce Clause and the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments). Elane Photography’s desire\nto work with heterosexual rather than homosexual couples does not give it license to violate\nthe NMHRA.\n\n3.     There is no exemption from antidiscrimination laws for creative or expressive\n       professions\n\n{52} There are no cases from either New Mexico jurisprudence or that of the United States\nSupreme Court that would compel a conclusion that the NMHRA violates Elane\nPhotography’s freedom of speech because it is engaged in a creative and expressive\n\n                                            18\n\fprofession. We decline to draw the line between “creative” or “expressive” professions and\nall others. While individuals in such professions undoubtedly engage in speech, and\nsometimes even create speech for others as part of their services, there is no precedent to\nsuggest that First Amendment protections allow such individuals or businesses to violate\nantidiscrimination laws. The wedding industry in particular employs a variety of\nprofessionals who offer their services to the public and whose work involves significant\nskills and creativity. For example, a flower shop is not intuitively “expressive,” but florists\nuse artistic skills and training to design and construct floral displays. Bakeries also offer\nservices for hire, and wedding cakes are famously intricate and artistic. Courts cannot be\nin the business of deciding which businesses are sufficiently artistic to warrant exemptions\nfrom antidiscrimination laws. These suggestions are not idle hypotheticals: we take judicial\nnotice of a variety of situations in which florists, bakeries, and other wedding vendors have\nrefused to serve same-sex couples. See, e.g., Lee Moran, Baker refuses to make wedding\ncake for lesbian couple, N.Y. Daily News (Feb. 4, 2013),\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/baker-refuses-wedding-cake-lesbian-\ncouple-article-1.1254776; Annette Cary, Arlene’s Flowers in Richland sued by gay couple,\nT r i - C i t y             H e r a l d          ( A p r .          1 8 ,      2 0 1 3 ) ,\nhttp://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/04/18/2361691/arlenes-flowers-in-richland-sued.html\n(quoting a florist as objecting to “using her time and artistic talent to support an event . . .\nthat she believes is wrong”) (emphasis added); see also Cervelli v. Aloha Bed & Breakfast,\nCiv. No. 11-1-3103-12 ECN, Order (Haw. Circ. Court 1st Cir. Apr. 15, 2013)\nwww.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/2013-04-15_-_cervelli_order.pdf (finding that a bed\nand breakfast violated Hawaii’s public accommodation law when it refused service to a\nsame-sex couple and granting partial summary judgment for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief).\n\n{53} We are persuaded by cases suggesting that the First Amendment does not exempt\ncreative or expressive businesses from antidiscrimination laws. In Hishon v. King &\nSpalding, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111188\"><a href=\"/opinion/111188/hishon-v-king-spalding/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71-73 (1984), the United States Supreme Court reversed the dismissal\nof a Title VII employment discrimination complaint against the law firm of King &\nSpalding. In doing so, the Court rejected the firm’s argument that by applying\nantidiscrimination laws to the firm’s selection of its partners, the government “would\ninfringe [First Amendment] constitutional rights of expression or association.” Id. at 78.\nThe Court held that “[i]nvidious private discrimination may be characterized as a form of\nexercising freedom of association protected by the First Amendment, but it has never been\naccorded affirmative constitutional protections.” Id. (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Legal work unquestionably involves creative and\nexpressive skill and effort, but antidiscrimination laws still govern how a law firm runs its\nbusiness.\n\n{54} Elane Photography attempts to distinguish King & Spalding by arguing that the type\nof compelled-speech claim Elane Photography advances should apply only to public\naccommodations law because such an exemption “would protect a firm’s decision not to\nadvocate an argument that its partners cannot in good conscience advance.” However, this\n\n                                              19\n\fdecision would already be protected under New Mexico law. The NMHRA does not\nprohibit a law firm, even one that is a public accommodation, from turning away clients with\nwhose views the firm disagrees or with whom it simply does not wish to work. See § 28-1-\n7(F) (prohibited grounds do not include ideology or personal dislike). What the NMHRA\nforbids, and what Elane Photography’s proposed exception would allow, is for a law firm\nto turn away a client because the firm finds the client offensive on the basis of a protected\nclassification.    Accepting Elane Photography’s argument would exempt from\nantidiscrimination laws any business that provided a creative or expressive service. Such\nan exemption would not be limited to religious objections or to sexual orientation\ndiscrimination; it would allow any business in a creative or expressive field to refuse service\non any protected basis, including race, national origin, religion, sex, or disability.\n\n{55} Elane Photography also suggests that enforcing the NMHRA against it would mean\nthat an African-American photographer could not legally refuse to photograph a Ku Klux\nKlan rally. This hypothetical suffers from the reality that political views and political group\nmembership, including membership in the Klan, are not protected categories under the\nNMHRA. See § 28-1-7(F) (prohibiting public accommodation discrimination based on\n“race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,\nspousal affiliation or physical or mental handicap”). Therefore, an African-American could\ndecline to photograph a Ku Klux Klan rally. However, the point is well-taken when the roles\nin the hypothetical are reversed—a Ku Klux Klan member who operates a photography\nbusiness as a public accommodation would be compelled to photograph an African-\nAmerican under the NMHRA. This result is required by the NMHRA, which seeks to\npromote equal rights and access to public accommodations by prohibiting discrimination\nbased on certain specified protected classifications.\n\n{56} However, adoption of Elane Photography’s argument would allow a photographer\nwho was a Klan member to refuse to photograph an African-American customer’s wedding,\ngraduation, newborn child, or other event if the photographer felt that the photographs would\ncast African-Americans in a positive light or be interpreted as the photographer’s\nendorsement of African-Americans. A holding that the First Amendment mandates an\nexception to public accommodations laws for commercial photographers would license\ncommercial photographers to freely discriminate against any protected class on the basis that\nthe photographer was only exercising his or her right not to express a viewpoint with which\nhe or she disagrees. Such a holding would undermine all of the protections provided by\nantidiscrimination laws.\n\n{57} In short, we conclude that the NMHRA’s prohibition on sexual-orientation\ndiscrimination does not violate Elane Photography’s First Amendment right to refrain from\nspeaking. The government has not required Elane Photography to promote the government’s\nmessage, nor has the government required Elane Photography to facilitate third parties’\nmessages, except to the extent that Elane Photography already facilitates third parties’\nmessages, for hire, as part of the services that it offers as a for-profit public accommodation.\nEven if the services it offers are creative or expressive, Elane Photography must offer its\n\n                                              20\n\fservices to customers without regard for the customers’ race, sex, sexual orientation, or other\nprotected classification.\n\nB.      THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE ELANE PHOTOGRAPHY’S FIRST\n        AMENDMENT FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS\n\n{58} Elane Photography argues that enforcement of the NMHRA against it for refusing\nto photograph Willock’s wedding violates its First Amendment right to freely exercise its\nreligion. See U.S. Const. amend. I (Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise\nof religion).\n\n{59} It is an open question whether Elane Photography, which is a limited liability\ncompany rather than a natural person, has First Amendment free exercise rights. Several\nfederal courts have recently addressed this question with differing outcomes. Compare, e.g.,\nConestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., slip\nop. at 11, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (3d Cir. July 26, 2013, No. 13-1144) (“[W]e conclude that\nfor-profit, secular corporations cannot engage in religious exercise . . . .”), with Grote v.\nSebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (7th Cir. 2013) (“[T]he [plaintiffs’] use of the corporate form\nis not dispositive of the [free exercise] claim.”). However, it is not necessary for this Court\nto address whether Elane Photography has a constitutionally protected right to exercise its\nreligion. Assuming that Elane Photography has such rights, they are not offended by\nenforcement of the NMHRA.\n\n{60} Under established law, “the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of\nthe obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground\nthat the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).”\nEmp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 879 (1990) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).3 In order to state a valid First Amendment free\nexercise claim, a party must show either (a) that the law in question is not a “neutral law of\ngeneral applicability,” id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) or (b) that the\nchallenge implicates both the Free Exercise Clause and an independent constitutional\nprotection, id. at 881, or possibly (c) that the law operates “in a context that len[ds] itself to\nindividualized government assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.” Id. at 884.\nElane Photography does not claim that the individualized assessment situation is applicable\nto the present case. We address its claims under the other two categories below.\n\n\n\n        3\n         Congress attempted to overrule Smith by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct of 1993 (USRFRA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb (2006). However, the application of the\nUSRFRA to state and local laws was held unconstitutional in City of Boerne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 511, 519 (1997). The Smith standard continues to be good law for evaluating\nfederal free exercise challenges to state actions. See Christian Legal Soc’y, ___ U.S. at ___\nn.24, ___ n.27, 130 S. Ct. at 2993 n.24, 2995 n.27 (applying Smith standard).\n\n                                               21\n\f1.      The NMHRA is a neutral law of general applicability\n\n{61} The United States Supreme Court elaborated on the rule concerning “law that is\nneutral and of general applicability” in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of\nHialeah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531, 546 (1993). A law is not neutral “if [its] object . . . is to infringe\nupon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation.” Id. at 533. It is not\ngenerally applicable if it “impose[s] burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief”\nwhile permitting exceptions for secular conduct or for favored religions. Id. at 543. These\ninquiries are related, id. at 531; the Court observed that improper intent could be inferred if\nthe law was a “‘religious gerrymander’” that burdened religion but exempted similar secular\nactivity. Id. at 534-35. If a law is neither neutral nor generally applicable, it “must be\njustified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to\nadvance that interest.” Id. at 531-32; see also id. at 546 (“The compelling interest standard\nthat we apply once a law fails to meet the Smith requirements is not water[ed] . . . down but\nreally means what it says.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n{62} In Lukumi Babalu Aye, the city of Hialeah had passed several ordinances that\nprohibited religious sacrifice of animals but exempted secular slaughterhouses, kosher\nslaughterhouses, hunting, fishing, euthanasia of unwanted animals, and extermination of\npests. Id. at 526-28, 536, 543-44. The Court held that this was a “religious gerrymander,”\nid. at 535, the result of which was “that few if any killings of animals [were] prohibited other\nthan Santeria sacrifice,” id. at 536. The Court concluded that “[t]he ordinances had as their\nobject the suppression of religion” and were therefore nonneutral. Id. at 542. The Court\nthen examined whether the ordinances were generally applicable and whether the\ngovernment was selectively burdening only religiously motivated conduct. Id. at 542-43.\nThe Court did not precisely define the standard for assessing general applicability, but it did\nobserve that the Hialeah ordinances were grossly under-inclusive with respect to the laws’\nstated goals, id. at 543-45, and it concluded that the laws burdened “only . . . conduct\nmotivated by religious belief.” Id. at 545. The Court applied strict scrutiny to the\nordinances and found them unconstitutional. Id. at 546-47.\n\n{63} Elane Photography argues that the NMHRA is not generally applicable and that this\nCourt therefore should apply strict scrutiny to the application of the NMHRA to Elane\nPhotography. Elane Photography identifies several exemptions from the antidiscrimination\nprovisions of the NMHRA and argues that these exemptions make it not generally\napplicable. Specifically, Elane Photography points to Section 28-1-9(A)(1), which exempts\nsales or rentals of single-family homes if the owner does not own more than three houses,4\nand Section 28-1-9(D), which exempts owners who live in small multi-family dwellings and\nrent out the other units. Elane Photography argues that these exemptions, like those in\n\n\n        4\n         The owner also may not engage in discriminatory advertising. Section 28-1-9(A).\nIn addition, if the seller was not the most recent occupant of the house, he or she is exempt\nfrom the NMHRA for only one sale per twenty-four month period. Section 28-1-9(A)(2).\n\n                                               22\n\fLukumi Babalu Aye, “impermissibly prefer the secular to the religious.”\n\n{64} This is a misreading of Section 28-1-9. Unlike the exemptions in Lukumi Babalu\nAye, the exemptions in Section 28-1-9(A) and (D) apply equally to religious and secular\nconduct. Neither subsection discusses motivation; homeowners who meet the criteria of\nSection 28-1-9(A) and (D) are permitted to discriminate regardless of whether they do so on\nreligious or nonreligious grounds. Therefore, the NMHRA does not target only religiously\nmotivated discrimination, and these exemptions do not prevent the NMHRA from being\ngenerally applicable. These exemptions also do not indicate any animus toward religion by\nthe Legislature that might render the law nonneutral; similar exemptions commonly appear\nin housing discrimination laws, including the federal Fair Housing Act. See 42 U.S.C. §\n3603(b)(1) & (2) (2012) (exempting from compliance “any single-family house sold or\nrented by an owner,” provided such “owner does not own more than three such . . . houses”\nand subject to additional limitations, and also exempting “rooms or units in dwellings\ncontaining living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families\nliving independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such\nliving quarters as his [or her] residence”).\n\n{65} Elane Photography also argues that the exemptions to the NMHRA for religious\norganizations undercut the purpose of the statute. In particular, Elane Photography\nhighlights Section 28-1-9(B) and (C), which in its reading permits religious organizations\nto “decline same-sex couples as customers.”\n\n{66} Once again, Elane Photography’s interpretation rests on a distorted reading of the\nstatute. Section 28-1-9(B) allows religious organizations to “limit[] admission to or giv[e]\npreference to persons of the same religion or denomination or [to make] selections of buyers,\nlessees or tenants” that promote the organization’s religious principles. In the context of\n“buyers, lessees or tenants,” “buyers” clearly refers to purchasers of real estate rather than\nretail customers. Id. Subsection (C) exempts religious organizations from provisions of the\nNMHRA governing sexual orientation and gender identity, but only regarding “employment\nor renting.” If a religious organization sold goods or services to the general public, neither\nsubsection would allow the organization to turn away same-sex couples while catering to\nopposite-sex couples of all faiths. Subsection (B) permits religious organizations to serve\nonly or primarily people of their own faith, as well as to discriminate in certain limited real\nestate transactions; Subsection (C) applies only to employment and, again, to real estate.\n\n{67} In other words, neither of the religious exemptions in Section 28-1-9 would permit\na religious organization to take the actions that Elane Photography did in this case.\nFurthermore, these exemptions do not prevent the NMHRA from being generally applicable.\nExemptions for religious organizations are common in a wide variety of laws, and they\nreflect the attempts of the Legislature to respect free exercise rights by reducing legal\nburdens on religion.

The exemptions do not\nprefer secular conduct over religious conduct or evince any hostility toward religion. We\nhold that the NMHRA is a neutral law of general applicability, and as such it does not offend\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n2.      Elane Photography has not adequately briefed its hybrid rights claim\n\n{69} In Smith, the United States Supreme Court left open the possibility that a neutral law\nof general applicability could nevertheless be unconstitutional if the law infringed both free\nexercise rights and an independent constitutional protection. 494 U.S. at 881. The Court\nrecognized that in pre-Smith cases, it had sometimes applied more rigorous scrutiny to\nneutral, generally applicable laws. Id. The Court distinguished those cases by characterizing\nthem not as simple free exercise cases, but as “hybrid situation[s],” id. at 882, in which the\nfree exercise claims were raised “in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such\nas freedom of speech and of the press.” Id. at 881. Elane Photography mentions that\nbecause it raised both a free exercise claim and a compelled-speech claim, it has made a\nhybrid-rights claim under which the NMHRA should receive strict scrutiny.\n\n{70} This Court requires that the parties adequately brief all appellate issues to include an\nargument, the standard of review, and citations to authorities for each issue presented. In re\nAdoption of Doe, 1984-NMSC-024, ¶ 2, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1317098\"><a href=\"/opinion/1317098/matter-of-adoption-of-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1317098\"><a href=\"/opinion/1317098/matter-of-adoption-of-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“[T]o present an\nissue on appeal for review, an appellant must submit argument and authority as required by\nrule.” (emphasis omitted)). “We will not review unclear arguments, or guess at what [a\nparty’s] arguments might be.” Headley v.

To rule on an inadequately briefed issue, this Court would\nhave to develop the arguments itself, effectively performing the parties’ work for them. See\nState v. Clifford, 1994-NMSC-048, ¶ 19, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1209936\"><a href=\"/opinion/1209936/state-v-clifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1209936\"><a href=\"/opinion/1209936/state-v-clifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“We remind counsel\nthat we are not required to do their research . . . .”). This creates a strain on judicial\nresources and a substantial risk of error. It is of no benefit either to the parties or to future\nlitigants for this Court to promulgate case law based on our own speculation rather than the\nparties’ carefully considered arguments.\n\n{71} Elane Photography devotes a single three-sentence paragraph to its hybrid-rights\nclaim, stating that a hybrid claim exists because it has raised a compelled-speech claim and\n\n                                               24\n\fa free exercise claim under the NMRFRA. However, as discussed in this opinion, neither\nof these claims is independently viable, and Elane Photography offers no analysis to explain\nwhy the two claims together should be greater than the sum of their parts. Elane\nPhotography cites two cases, Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"164292\"><a href=\"/opinion/164292/axson-flynn-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2004), and\nHealth Services Division, Health & Environment Dep’t v.

As a matter of New Mexico law,\nElane Photography’s briefing of its hybrid-rights claim is inadequate to permit us to review\nthe issue. For this reason, we do not consider its hybrid-rights argument.\n\nIII.   ENFORCEMENT OF THE NMHRA DOES NOT VIOLATE THE NMRFRA\n       BECAUSE THE NMRFRA IS NOT APPLICABLE IN A SUIT BETWEEN\n       PRIVATE PARTIES\n\n{72} Finally, Elane Photography argues that the Commission’s enforcement of the\nNMHRA against it violates the New Mexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The\nNMRFRA provides:\n\n               A government agency shall not restrict a person’s free exercise of\n       religion unless:\n\n              A.      the restriction is in the form of a rule of general applicability\n       and does not directly discriminate against religion or among religions; and\n\n               B.      the application of the restriction to the person is essential to\n       further a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means\n       of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n\nSection 28-22-3. “Free exercise of religion” is defined as “an act or a refusal to act that is\nsubstantially motivated by religious belief.” Section 28-22-2(A).\n\n{73} Willock argues, and the Court of Appeals held, that the NMRFRA did not protect\nElane Photography’s refusal to photograph Willock’s wedding, even though the refusal was\nreligiously motivated, because the NMRFRA “was not meant to apply in suits between\nprivate litigants.” Elane Photography, 2012-NMCA-086, ¶ 46. There is no other case law\non this point in New Mexico; the Court of Appeals relied on federal cases interpreting the\nfederal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Id. ¶¶ 46-47.\n\n{74} The NMRFRA states that “[a] person whose free exercise of religion has been\nrestricted by a violation of the New Mexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act may assert\nthat violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief\nagainst a government agency.” Section 28-22-4(A) (emphasis added). Elane Photography\nargues that the phrase “against a government agency” modifies “appropriate relief,” rather\nthan “a judicial proceeding.” In other words, Elane Photography argues that although the\n\n                                             25\n\frelief available is limited, the NMRFRA can be invoked even when the government is not\na party.\n\n{75} However, the statute is violated only if a “government agency” restricts a person’s\nfree exercise of religion. Section 28-22-3. A “government agency” includes “the state or\nany of its political subdivisions, institutions, departments, agencies, commissions,\ncommittees, boards, councils, bureaus or authorities.” Section 28-22-2(B). The list of\ngovernment agencies does not include the Legislature or the courts. It could be expected that\nthe Legislature would have included itself and the courts in Section 28-22-2(B) if it meant\nthe NMRFRA to apply in common-law disputes or private enforcement actions. Instead, the\nexamples of government agencies are exclusively administrative or executive entities.\n\n{76} Moreover, the structure of the NMRFRA as a whole suggests that the Legislature\ncontemplated that the statute would apply only to legal actions in which the government was\na party. The only relief authorized by the statute is “injunctive or declaratory relief against\na government agency,” § 28-22-4(A)(1), or “damages pursuant to the Tort Claims Act” with\nattorneys’ fees and costs, § 28-22-4(A)(2). Nowhere does the NMRFRA authorize damages\nor injunctive relief against a non-governmental party.\n\n{77} Elane Photography argues that because Willock’s suit was adjudicated by the New\nMexico Human Rights Commission, which is presumably a “government agency” for\npurposes of Section 28-22-2(B), the Commission’s decision against it qualifies as a\nrestriction of its free exercise of religion. However, Elane Photography appealed the\nCommission’s determination to a New Mexico district court for a trial de novo pursuant to\nSection 28-1-13(A). The instant appeal concerns the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for Willock; the Commission is not a party to this case, and its order no longer has\nany legal effect. See § 39-3-1 (stating that appeals to the district court for trials de novo\n“shall be tried anew . . . as if no trial had been had below”). Willock argues, and we agree,\nthat the Commission acted merely as an administrative tribunal to decide the dispute between\nElane Photography and herself. The government’s adjudication of disputes between private\nparties does not constitute government restriction of a party’s free exercise rights for\npurposes of the NMRFRA.\n\n{78} For the reasons stated above, we hold that as a matter of New Mexico law, the New\nMexico Religious Freedom Restoration Act is inapplicable to disputes in which a\ngovernment agency is not a party.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n{79} Elane Photography’s refusal to serve Vanessa Willock violated the New Mexico\nHuman Rights Act, which prohibits a public accommodation from refusing to offer its\nservices to a person based on that person’s sexual orientation. Enforcing the NMHRA\nagainst Elane Photography does not violate the Free Speech or the Free Exercise clause of\nthe First Amendment or the NMRFRA. For these reasons, we affirm the grant of summary\n\n                                              26\n\fjudgment in Willock’s favor.\n\n{80}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                               ____________________________________\n                                               EDWARD L.

W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626-29 (1943).\nSome students refused to salute, believing as Jehovah’s Witnesses “that the obligation\nimposed by law of God is superior to that of laws enacted by temporal government.” Id. at\n629. They looked for authority in the Bible, Book of Exodus, Chapter 20, verses 4 and 5:\n“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in\nheaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou\nshalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nJehovah’s Witnesses considered “the flag is an ‘image’ within this command,” which they\nwere bound by God not to salute. Id.\n\n{82} In a ringing endorsement of the First Amendment, the United States Supreme Court\nstruck down the West Virginia statute, noting the irony of the state’s position: “To sustain\nthe compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the\nindividual’s right to speak his own mind, left it open to public authorities to compel him to\nutter what is not in his mind.” Id. at 634. And again, “[i]f there is any fixed star in our\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be\northodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to\nconfess by word or act their faith therein.” Id. at 642. In his concurrence, Justice Black had\nthis to add:\n\n                                              27\n\f       The Jehovah’s Witnesses, without any desire to show disrespect for either the\n       flag or the country, interpret the Bible as commanding, at the risk of God’s\n       displeasure, that they not go through the form of a pledge of allegiance to any\n       flag. The devoutness of their belief is evidenced by their willingness to\n       suffer persecution and punishment, rather than make the pledge.\n\nId. at 643 (Black, J., concurring). Considering the times, the Barnette opinion stands today\nas an act of the utmost courage; it represents one of the Court’s finest moments.\n\n{83} Jonathan and Elaine Huguenin see themselves in much the same position as the\nstudents in Barnette. As devout, practicing Christians, they believe, as a matter of faith, that\ncertain commands of the Bible are not left open to secular interpretation; they are meant to\nbe obeyed. Among those commands, according to the Huguenins, is an injunction against\nsame-sex marriage. On the record before us, no one has questioned the Huguenin’s\ndevoutness or their sincerity; their religious convictions deserve our respect. In the words\nof their legal counsel, the Huguenins “believed that creating photographs telling the story\nof that event [a same-sex wedding] would express a message contrary to their sincerely held\nbeliefs, and that doing so would disobey God.” If honoring same-sex marriage would so\nconflict with their fundamental religious tenets, no less than the Jehovah’s Witnesses in\nBarnette, how then, they ask, can the State of New Mexico compel them to “disobey God”\nin this case? How indeed?\n\n{84} Twenty-four years later, during the zenith of the Civil Rights era, the Supreme Court\nprovided a partial answer. In Loving v. Virginia, the State of Virginia, like sixteen similarly\nsituated states with miscegenation laws, prohibited marriage between the white and black\nraces, making it a crime punishable by imprisonment. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4, 6 (1967). Such laws\narose as an incident of slavery and were common in Virginia and elsewhere since early\ntimes. Id. at 6. The Lovings, an interracial couple, had been lawfully married elsewhere and\nwanted to live openly as husband and wife in Virginia. Id. at 2-3. For their honesty, they\nwere prosecuted and convicted; their prison sentences were suspended on condition that they\nleave Virginia and not return for 25 years. Id. at 3. The Virginia trial judge, in justifying\nthe convictions, drew strength from his view of the Bible:\n\n       “Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he\n       placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with this\n       arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he\n       separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.”\n\nId. at 3. Whatever opinion one might have of the trial judge’s religious views, which\nmirrored those of millions of Americans of the time, no one questioned his sincerity either\nor his religious conviction. In affirming the Lovings’ convictions, Virginia’s highest court\nobserved the religious, cultural, historical and moral roots that justified miscegenation laws.\nSee id.\n\n\n                                              28\n\f{85} The Supreme Court struck down Virginia’s miscegenation statute. Id. at 11-12.\nObserving that “[t]he freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal\nrights essential in the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men,” the Court held categorically\nthat “[t]here can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial\nclassifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 12. State\nlaws, even those religiously inspired, may not discriminate invidiously on the basis of race.\n\n{86} There is a lesson here. In a constitutional form of government, personal, religious,\nand moral beliefs, when acted upon to the detriment of someone else’s rights, have\nconstitutional limits. One is free to believe, think and speak as one’s conscience, or God,\ndictates. But when actions, even religiously inspired, conflict with other constitutionally\nprotected rights—in Loving the right to be free from invidious racial discrimination—then\nthere must be some accommodation. Recall that Barnette was all about the students; their\nexercise of First Amendment rights did not infringe upon anyone else. The Huguenins\ncannot make that claim. Their refusal to do business with the same-sex couple in this case,\nno matter how religiously inspired, was an affront to the legal rights of that couple, the right\ngranted them under New Mexico law to engage in the commercial marketplace free from\ndiscrimination.\n\n{87} But of course, the Huguenins are not trying to prohibit anyone from marrying. They\nonly want to be left alone to conduct their photography business in a manner consistent with\ntheir moral convictions. In their view, they seek only the freedom not to endorse someone\nelse’s lifestyle. Loving, therefore, does not completely answer the question the Huguenins\npose. To complete the circle, we turn to our third case.\n\n{88} Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, upheld the federal Civil Rights Act of\n1964, a milestone enactment which, among other achievements, declared invidious\ndiscrimination unlawful, not just by the state but by private citizens, when providing goods\nand services in the sphere of public accommodations. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246, 261-62 (1964).\nThe Act declared: “‘All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of\npublic accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on\nthe ground of race, color, religion or national origin.’” Id. at 247. A watershed achievement,\nthe Act vindicated nearly a century of frustrated effort to fulfill the promise of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, to end not only slavery but all of its traces as well. See id. at 244-46. And\nending second-class citizenship, being denied a seat in a restaurant or a room in an\ninn—purely on the basis of one’s race or religion—was a goal that drove the passage of the\nAct. See id. at 252-53.\n\n{89} By the time of the success of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, many states had already\npassed their own public accommodation laws. See id. at 358-59 (noting that thirty-two states\nalready had public accommodation laws); see also Lisa Gabrielle & Annette K. Sanderson,\nDiscrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey of State and Federal Public\nAccommodations Laws, 7 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 215, 240 (1978) (recognizing that\n\n                                               29\n\f“the existence of numerous state laws facilitated Congress’ acceptance of Title II” of the\nCivil Rights Act). Today, many states have Human Rights Acts similar to New Mexico’s.\nSee, e.g., 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-102(A) (2010); Iowa Code Ann. § 216.7 (2007); Md.\nCode Ann., State Government § 20-304 (2009); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 651.070 (2011).\nPublic accommodations have been expanded to preclude invidious discrimination in most\nevery public business, including the Huguenin’s photography business. Prohibited\nclassifications have been enlarged from the historical classes—race, religion, gender,\nnational origin—to include sexual orientation. See, e.g., Douglas NeJaime, Marriage\nInequality: Same-Sex Relationships, Religious Exemptions, and the Production of Sexual\nOrientation Discrimination, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1169, 1190 (2012) (“Twenty-one states and\nthe District of Columbia cover sexual orientation in their antidiscrimination laws governing\nemployment, housing, and public accommodations.”). The New Mexico Legislature has\nmade it clear that to discriminate in business on the basis of sexual orientation is just as\nintolerable as discrimination directed toward race, color, national origin or religion. See\nNMSA 1978, § 28-1-7(F) (2004). The Huguenins today can no more turn away customers\non the basis of sexual orientation—photographing a same-sex marriage ceremony—than\nthey could refuse to photograph African-Americans or Muslims.\n\n{90} All of which, I assume, is little comfort to the Huguenins, who now are compelled\nby law to compromise the very religious beliefs that inspire their lives. Though the rule of\nlaw requires it, the result is sobering. It will no doubt leave a tangible mark on the\nHuguenins and others of similar views.\n\n{91} On a larger scale, this case provokes reflection on what this nation is all about, its\npromise of fairness, liberty, equality of opportunity, and justice. At its heart, this case\nteaches that at some point in our lives all of us must compromise, if only a little, to\naccommodate the contrasting values of others. A multicultural, pluralistic society, one of\nour nation’s strengths, demands no less. The Huguenins are free to think, to say, to believe,\nas they wish; they may pray to the God of their choice and follow those commandments in\ntheir personal lives wherever they lead. The Constitution protects the Huguenins in that\nrespect and much more. But there is a price, one that we all have to pay somewhere in our\ncivic life.\n\n{92} In the smaller, more focused world of the marketplace, of commerce, of public\naccommodation, the Huguenins have to channel their conduct, not their beliefs, so as to leave\nspace for other Americans who believe something different. That compromise is part of the\nglue that holds us together as a nation, the tolerance that lubricates the varied moving parts\nof us as a people. That sense of respect we owe others, whether or not we believe as they\ndo, illuminates this country, setting it apart from the discord that afflicts much of the rest of\nthe world. In short, I would say to the Huguenins, with the utmost respect: it is the price of\ncitizenship. I therefore concur.\n\n                                                ____________________________________\n                                                RICHARD C.
