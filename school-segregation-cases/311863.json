BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Consistent  with the method of  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56, we\r\n\ncanvass the material facts in a light that flatters, but does not\r\n\nimpermissibly distort,  the plaintiff's claims.   We then recount\r\n\nthe travel of the case.\r\n\n                          A.  The Facts.\r                                    A.  The Facts.\r                                                 \r\n\n          We outline  the facts, omitting the  graphic details on\r\n\nwhich  our dissenting  brother prefers  to dwell.   In  our view,\r\n\nthese  details  are not  relevant to  the  legal issues  posed on\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n          In the early morning hours  of May 26, 1988, plaintiff-\r\n\nappellant  Wilfredo Martinez  Rodriguez  (Martinez),  a  youthful\r\n\nmember of Puerto Rico's  police force, drove to the  Loiza Street\r\n\nPrecinct,  located in  the  San Juan  metropolitan area.   Though\r\n\nMartinez was not scheduled to begin his shift until 4:00 a.m., he\r\n\narrived  early, pursuant to local custom, in order to procure his\r\n\npost  assignment.  Martinez alleges that he  was on duty from the\r\n\nmoment  he arrived    even before his shift  began   because from\r\n\nthat  point  forward he  was  subject  to  the shift  commander's\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\norders.\r\n\n          Upon  Martinez' arrival,  a fellow  officer who  was on\r\n\nduty at  the time,  Angel Valentin Corali  (Valentin), approached\r\n\nMartinez' car and called him \"pretty boy\" (\"papito lindo\").  When\r\n\nMartinez alighted, Valentin drew his service revolver, pointed it\r\n\nat Martinez' stomach, cocked the hammer, placed his finger on the\r\n\ntrigger,  and  inquired if  Martinez was  afraid.   Valentin then\r\n\ndisarmed  the weapon,  and Martinez  hurried inside  the station,\r\n\nfirst telling  Valentin:  \"Don't  horse around with  that because\r\n\nyou will kill me.\"\r\n\n          Shortly  after  this  fracas  had   occurred,  Valentin\r\n\naccosted Martinez in the  radio room, inserted his finger  into a\r\n\nsmall hole in Martinez'  undershirt, and ripped it.   Once again,\r\n\nMartinez walked away  from Valentin.   He then  changed into  his\r\n\nuniform, entered  the waiting  room, and  reported  to his  shift\r\n\nsupervisor, defendant-appellee Juan Trinidad Marrero (Trinidad).\r\n\n          Soon  thereafter,  Valentin  reappeared,   pointed  his\r\n\nrevolver at Martinez' genitals, cocked  the hammer, and, with his\r\n\nfinger on the trigger, threatened to \"blow away\" Martinez'  penis\r\n\n(asking  him, somewhat  rhetorically, if  he was  scared).   When\r\n\nValentin lowered the weapon, Martinez immediately moved away from\r\n\nhim.   Within minutes Valentin again  approached Martinez, cocked\r\n\nthe  revolver,  aimed  it  at Martinez'  groin,  and  resumed his\r\n\ntaunting.     The   revolver  accidentally   discharged,  maiming\r\n\nMartinez.\r\n\n          The  first  encounter  took  place  in  the  precinct's\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nparking lot and  the rest transpired  inside the police  station.\r\n\nAccording to Martinez, roughly  twenty minutes elapsed from start\r\n\nto finish.  All  parties agree that the shooting,  which occurred\r\n\nbefore the 4:00 a.m. shift change, was unintentional.1\r\n\n                     B.  Travel of the Case.\r                               B.  Travel of the Case.\r                                                     \r\n\n          On  May  22,  1989,  Martinez  filed  suit  in  federal\r\n\ndistrict  court  against   numerous  defendants,  including,   as\r\n\nrelevant here, Rafael Colon Pizarro (Colon), Luis A. Velez Rentas\r\n\n(Velez),  and  Trinidad  (collectively, \"the  officers\"  or  \"the\r\n\ndefendants\").2     Invoking  42  U.S.C.      1983  and  premising\r\n\njurisdiction  on the  existence  of a  federal  question, see  28\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.     1331  (1988), he  alleged  that  his  rights had  been\r\n\nabridged in that each  defendant owed him a duty to intervene and\r\n\nprotect  him  from readily  discernible harm  at  the hands  of a\r\n\nfellow  officer,  but  each   defendant  breached  this  duty  by\r\n\nsubsequent  inaction.3   Martinez  asserted  pendent tort  claims\r\n\nwith respect  to  all  three  defendants  and,  with  respect  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In  his memorandum of law  in support of  his opposition to\r\ndefendant  Carlos Lopez-Feliciano's  motion to  dismiss, Martinez\r\nstated that  \"the revolver apparently fired by accident.\"  Record\r\nAppendix  at  21.   At  any  rate,  the  summary judgment  record\r\ncontains no facts that would support a contrary finding; and, for\r\naught  that appears,  Martinez has  never asserted  that Valentin\r\nshot him intentionally.\r\n\n     2Plaintiff asserted claims against several other defendants,\r\nincluding  Valentin and  Lopez-Feliciano.   Those claims  are not\r\nbefore us, and we ignore them for purposes of this opinion.\r\n\n     3Although  the underlying  facts  are  hotly  contested,  we\r\nassume  for purposes of this  appeal, as Martinez  would have it,\r\nthat  all three  defendants witnessed  the entire  progression of\r\nevents and had a meaningful opportunity to intervene at each step\r\nalong the way.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nTrinidad,  asserted a  section  1983 claim  based on  supervisory\r\n\nliability.\r\n\n          After  a  flurry of  pretrial  discovery,  the officers\r\n\nmoved for  summary  judgment.   They  argued,  inter  alia,  that\r                                                                    \r\n\nValentin was not acting under color  of state law when the mishap\r\n\noccurred; and that, therefore,  onlooker officers did not have  a\r\n\nconstitutional  duty  to  intervene  on Martinez'  behalf.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court   referred  the  motions  and   Martinez'  timely\r\n\nopposition to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate concluded that,\r\n\nunder DeShaney, the officers  had no constitutional obligation to\r                        \r\n\nprotect Martinez from Valentin's  actions, and urged the district\r\n\ncourt to grant summary  judgment.  The plaintiff objected  to the\r\n\nmagistrate's report and  recommendation, but the  district court,\r\n\naffording de novo review, see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 72(b), adopted the\r                                       \r\n\nreport,  accepted   the  recommendation,  and   entered  judgment\r\n\naccordingly.  This appeal followed.\r\n\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\n          A district  court may  grant summary judgment  only \"if\r\n\nthe  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\r\n\nadmissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\r\n\nthat there is  no genuine issue as to any  material fact and that\r\n\nthe  moving party is entitled to a  judgment as a matter of law.\"\r\n\nFed.  R. Civ. P.  56(c). We have  charted the boundaries  of this\r\n\nrule in case after  case, see, e.g., Coyne  v. Taber Partners  I,\r                                                                          \r\n\n    F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1995) [No. 94-2231, slip op. at 4-5];\r\n\nNational Amusements, Inc.  v.

In applying  this principle, it  is important to\r\n\nbear in mind that not every genuine factual conflict necessitates\r\n\na trial.  It is  only when a disputed  fact has the potential  to\r\n\nchange the outcome of  the suit under the governing law  if found\r\n\nfavorably  to  the  nonmovant  that  the  materiality  hurdle  is\r\n\ncleared.   See One  Parcel, 960  F.2d at 204.   Here,  the record\r                                    \r\n\nreflects a veritable salmagundi of bitterly  disputed facts   but\r\n\nnone that is material.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          To  that   extent,  then,   our  task   is  simplified.\r\n\nExercising  de  novo review,  see Pagano,  983  F.2d at  347, and\r                                                  \r\n\nadopting the  plaintiff's version of all  controverted facts (but\r\n\nnot,  however,  giving   credence  to  \"conclusory   allegations,\r\n\nimprobable  inferences,  [or]  unsupported speculation,\"  Medina-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMunoz, 896 F.2d  at 8), we conclude that the  court below did not\r               \r\n\nerr in jettisoning the section 1983 claims.\r\n\nIII.

Board  of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36,\r                                                             \r\n\n40 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1021 (1987); accord West v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAtkins, 487 U.S.  42, 48  (1988); Daniels v.

Of  course, the  reference to  \"state law\"\r\n\ncannot  be taken literally, for Puerto Rico enjoys the functional\r\n\nequivalent  of statehood  in regard  to section  1983 and,  thus,\r\n\nstate law includes Puerto Rico law.  See Playboy Enters., Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPublic  Serv. Comm'n  of P.R., 906  F.2d 25,  31 n.8  (1st Cir.),\r                                       \r\n\ncert.  denied, 498 U.S. 959  (1990); Berrios v.  Inter Am.

Since the plaintiff has not\r\n\nalleged the transgression  of any  right secured to  him under  a\r\n\nfederal  statute,  we  may  narrow  the  inquiry  still  further,\r\n\nlimiting   it  to  whether  the  facts  show  a  violation  of  a\r\n\nconstitutional right.   It is  to this elusive  question that  we\r\n\nnext proceed.\r\n\n                    A.  The Duty to Intervene.\r                              A.  The Duty to Intervene.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Plaintiff pins  his hopes  principally on a  claim that\r\n\nthe defendants'  failure to protect  him from the  imminent peril\r\n\nposed by Valentin  abridged his right to substantive due process.\r\n\nThe  touchstone of the  law in this  area is  the Supreme Court's\r\n\nopinion  in DeShaney.  There,  a child sued  for damages under 42\r                              \r\n\nU.S.C.     1983, claiming  that employees  of a  state-run social\r\n\nservice  agency,  on  notice  of  a  parent's  abusive  behavior,\r\n\nnonetheless  failed  to  protect   the  child  from  the  readily\r\n\nforeseeable danger.   See DeShaney, 489  U.S. at 193.   The Court\r                                            \r\n\naffirmed  the entry  of  summary judgment  in defendants'  favor.\r\n\nChief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, explained that\r\n\nthe Due Process Clause  ordinarily does not require the  state to\r\n\nprotect  an  individual's life,  limb,  or  property against  the\r\n\nmarauding of third parties not acting to the state's behoof.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at  196.   Consequently, \"a  State's  failure to  protect an\r             \r\n\nindividual against private violence  simply does not constitute a\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nviolation of the Due Process Clause.\"  Id. at 197.\r                                                    \r\n\n          Although the  DeShaney Court left open  the possibility\r                                          \r\n\nof  certain  circumscribed  exceptions  to the  general  rule  of\r\n\nnonliability,  Martinez makes no effort to slide within them.  He\r\n\ndoes not  argue that he was in the  custody of the state, see id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 198-200  (discussing right to  protection arising in  favor of\r\n\nincarcerated   prisoners   and  involuntarily   committed  mental\r\n\npatients), or that he was in its \"functional custody,\" see id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n201 n.9 (discussing possible existence of situations analogous to\r\n\nincarceration or institutionalization),  or that  the state  made\r\n\nhim  more  vulnerable to  Valentin's  actions,  see id.  at  201.\r                                                                 \r\n\nRather, Martinez contends that DeShaney is altogether inapposite.\r                                                 \r\n\n          To the extent  that this contention is based simply and\r\n\nsolely  on the fact that, unlike in DeShaney, the defendants here\r                                                      \r\n\nare  police officers,  not  social workers,  we  reject it.    Of\r\n\ncourse,  police officers  sometimes have  an affirmative  duty to\r                                             \r\n\nintervene  that is enforceable under the Due Process Clause.  For\r\n\nexample, \"[a]n officer who is present at the scene [of an arrest]\r\n\nand who fails  to take reasonable steps to protect  the victim of\r\n\nanother officer's use of excessive force can be held liable under\r\n\nsection  1983  for  his  nonfeasance,\"  provided  that  he had  a\r\n\n\"realistic opportunity\"  to prevent the other  officer's actions.\r\n\nGaudreault v. Municipality of  Salem, 923 F.2d 203, 207  n.3 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir.  1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 956 (1991); accord O'Neill v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nKrzeminski,  839 F.2d 9, 11-12 (2d Cir.  1988).  But this line of\r                    \r\n\ncases does not,  as plaintiff importunes, carve out  an exception\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nto  the DeShaney  rule.   Instead,  such  cases escape  the  rule\r                          \r\n\nbecause the aggressor is acting under color of his public office.\r\n\n          Gaudreault illustrates the point.  The quoted statement\r                              \r\n\nspecifically  contemplates that  the underlying  tortious conduct\r\n\ntake  place within the  context of  an arrest,  interrogation, or\r\n\nsimilar  maneuver, see Gaudreault, 923  F.2d at 206-07  &amp; n.3, in\r                                           \r\n\nwhich a differential  exists between the  victim and the  officer\r\n\nprecisely  because of  the latter's  status  as one  empowered to\r\n\nenforce  the law,  coercively if  necessary, against  the former.\r\n\nSimilarly, O'Neill involved  the beating of  a handcuffed man  by\r                            \r\n\nlaw enforcement officers during an interrogation in the detention\r\n\narea of  a police station.   See  O'Neill, 839  F.2d at  10.   We\r                                                   \r\n\ncannot imagine  a more  paradigmatic exercise of  state authority\r\n\nthan the processes of handcuffing, detaining, and interrogating a\r\n\ncitizen.   Gaudreault and O'Neill,  then, are cases  in which the\r                                           \r\n\naggressor is acting under color of  state law.

For  instance,  a police  officer  who  exercises,  but\r\n\nmisuses or exceeds, his lawfully possessed authority is generally\r\n\nthought to  be acting under color  of law.  See,  e.g., Gibson v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCity of Chicago, 910 F.2d 1510, 1518 (7th Cir. 1990).\r                         \r\n\n          The point is that segregating private action from state\r\n\naction  calls for  a more  sophisticated analysis.   In  general,\r\n\nsection  1983 is  not implicated unless  a state  actor's conduct\r\n\noccurs in the course of performing an actual or apparent  duty of\r\n\nhis office, or  unless the conduct is  such that the  actor could\r\n\nnot have behaved in that way but for the authority of his office.\r\n\nThus, whether a police officer is acting under color of state law\r\n\nturns on  the nature and  circumstances of the  officer's conduct\r\n\nand  the relationship of that  conduct to the  performance of his\r\n\nofficial duties.

To  the contrary, Valentin was\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nbent   on  a   singularly   personal  frolic:     tormenting   an\r\n\nacquaintance.5  Though on duty  and in uniform, Valentin's status\r\n\nas  a  police officer  simply did  not  enter into  his benighted\r\n\nharassment  of his fellow officer.   Hazing of  this sort, though\r\n\nreprehensible, is not action under color or pretense of law.\r\n\n          Nor  can it be said that Valentin's actions were in any\r\n\nmeaningful  way related either to  his official status  or to the\r\n\nperformance of his police duties.  In this regard, the case bears\r\n\na  resemblance to Delcambre.  There, the Fifth Circuit ruled that\r                                     \r\n\nthe  plaintiff, who  had been  assaulted on  the premises  of the\r\n\nmunicipal police station by her brother-in-law, the police chief,\r\n\nhad no cognizable  claim under 42 U.S.C.    1983.  See Delcambre,\r                                                                          \r\n\n635 F.2d at 408.  The assault arose out of a family squabble, and\r\n\nthe court found that the  police chief, though on duty, \"was  not\r\n\nacting  under color  of  law  as  required  for  liability  under\r\n\n[section 1983].\"  Id.\r                               \r\n\n          To  be sure,  Valentin shot  Martinez with  his service\r\n\nrevolver, and  in that sense it might be argued that the shooting\r\n\nwas made possible by Valentin's status  as a police officer.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCassady v.

The  facts in this\r\ncase  are congruent with this hypothesis.  The campaign of terror\r\nthat  Valentin  mounted  was  patently personal  in  nature,  and\r\nMartinez unquestionably  realized as much; indeed,  there was not\r\nthe slightest indication that  Valentin's conduct was  undertaken\r\npursuant to the authority of his office.

After  all, DeShaney  had not  yet been\r                                                        \r\n\ndecided; thus,  the whole  question of  a constitutional duty  to\r\n\nintervene  was  cloaked  in  uncertainty.    Even now,  with  the\r\n\nguidance furnished by the DeShaney Court, the precise contours of\r                                            \r\n\nthe  rule  as  it   applies  to  onlooker  officers   are  murky.\r\n\nConsequently,  even if Martinez had  some basis for  a claim that\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nthe  defendants owed him a duty grounded in the Constitution, the\r\n\ndimensions of  the right  were dimly  perceived (if  perceived at\r\n\nall).    It  follows  inexorably  that  the  defendants would  be\r\n\nentitled  to qualified  immunity and,  hence, entitled  to brevis\r                                                                           \r\n\ndisposition.\r\n\n                       D.

All  are unavailing.\r\n\nWe mention three of them (rejecting the remainder without further\r\n\nelaboration).\r\n\n          1.   Violation of Local  Law.  Martinez  urges that the\r                    1.   Violation of Local  Law.\r                                                \r\n\ndefendants' breach  of a provision  of Puerto Rico's  Civil Code,\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 25,    1003 (1980),7  furnishes a basis  for\r\n\nliability under 42 U.S.C.   1983.  He is wrong.\r\n\n          It  is established  beyond  peradventure  that a  state\r\n\nactor's  failure to observe a duty imposed by state law, standing\r\n\nalone, is not a sufficient foundation on which to erect a section\r\n\n1983 claim.   See, e.g., Amsden,  904 F.2d at  757; Chongris, 811\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  at  42-43.    Although  it  is  true  that   constitutional\r\n\nsignificance  may attach  to certain  interests created  by state\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The statute provides in pertinent part that police officers\r\nhave a duty\r\n\n          to protect persons and property,  to maintain\r\n          and keep  the public  order,  to observe  and\r\n          secure  the utmost  protection  of the  civil\r\n          rights  of the  citizens,  to prevent  . .  .\r\n          crime and . . . enforce obedience to the laws\r\n          . . . .\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25,   1003 (1980).\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nlaw,  see, e.g.,  Chongris,  811  F.2d  at 43  (recognizing  that\r                                    \r\n\n\"property rights,  while protected  by the  federal Constitution,\r\n\nare creatures  of state law\"),  not every transgression  of state\r\n\nlaw  does  double  duty  as  a  constitutional  violation.    The\r\n\nConstitution  is a  charter  of carefully  enumerated rights  and\r\n\nresponsibilities,  defining the  relationship between  the people\r\n\nand  a government of limited  powers.  Its  scope and application\r\n\nare necessarily determined by its own terms.  Though grand in its\r\n\ndesign and eloquent in  its phrasing, the Constitution is  not an\r\n\nempty  ledger  awaiting  the  entry of  an  aggrieved  litigant's\r\n\nrecitation  of  alleged state  law  violations    no  matter  how\r\n\negregious  those violations  may  appear within  the local  legal\r\n\nframework.8\r\n\n          Moreover, while  the plaintiff states that section 1003\r\n\ncreates a constitutionally protected \"entitlement\" under Board of\r                                                                           \r\n\nRegents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576-77 (1972), he does not develop\r                         \r\n\nthe thesis   and we do not see  how Roth applies.  Neither Roth's\r                                                                         \r\n\nfocus  nor its procedural design bears any similarity to the case\r\n\nat  hand.   For  one  thing, the  Roth  Court's  conception of  a\r                                                \r\n\ncognizable constitutional  entitlement  was limited  to  property\r\n\ninterests.    See id.  (citing Goldberg  v.  Kelly, 397  U.S. 254\r                                                            \r\n\n(1970)).  We  fail to  intuit how Roth  supports the  plaintiff's\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8The absence of a constitutional duty to intervene in no way\r                                               \r\ndetracts from the callous nature of the conduct attributed to the\r\nofficers in this case,  nor does it imply that  onlooker officers\r\nconfronted by  private violence may not have  a state law duty to\r\nintervene.   That question, quite simply, lies beyond the borders\r\nof this opinion.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nclaim that he had an entitlement, pursuant to section 1003, to be\r\n\nprotected  in  his  physical  person.   For  another  thing,  the\r\n\nremedial framework contemplated by Roth   procedural due process,\r                                                 \r\n\nprincipally in the form of notice and a hearing, see id. at 577  \r                                                                  \r\n\nhas no applicability at all to Martinez'  remonstrance.  Whatever\r\n\nother  uncertainties  may  plague this  case,  it  is  clear that\r\n\nMartinez is claiming a  substantive due process violation,  not a\r                                             \r\n\nprocedural due process violation.  See, e.g., Amsden, 904 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n753-54 (delineating differences).\r\n\n          In  sum, Roth is a round hole, and Martinez' square peg\r                                 \r\n\nof a case does not fit within it.\r\n\n          2.   Equal Protection.   The plaintiff  makes the  bold\r                    2.   Equal Protection.\r                                         \r\n\nassertion  that he  was denied  rights secured  to him  under the\r\n\nEqual Protection Clause because, were  he a private citizen,  the\r\n\ndefendants  would almost certainly have  come to his  rescue.  He\r\n\ndoes  not embellish this ipse  dixit in any  way.9  Consequently,\r                                              \r\n\nit  does not assist  his cause.   \"It is settled  in this circuit\r\n\nthat  issues  adverted to  on  appeal  in a  perfunctory  manner,\r\n\nunaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have\r\n\nbeen abandoned.\"   Ryan v.

So it is\r                         \r\n\nhere:   the  plaintiff's fleeting  reference to  equal protection\r\n\ndoes not succeed in preserving the issue for review.10\r\n\n          3.

CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.  Because the defendants' failure\r\n\nto intervene and protect the plaintiff against Valentin's private\r\n\nactions,  though regrettable,  cannot  be said  to have  violated\r\n\nrights   secured  to   the   plaintiff  by   the  United   States\r\n\nConstitution,  see DeShaney,  489  U.S. at  196-97, the  district\r                                     \r\n\ncourt did not err  in summarily disposing of the  federal claims.\r\n\nAnd, once the court determined so far in advance of trial that no\r\n\nlegitimate federal question existed, the jurisdictional basis for\r\n\nplaintiff's pendent claims under Puerto Rico law evaporated.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBrennan, 888 F.2d at 196.  Thus, the court properly dismissed the\r                 \r\n\nbalance of the complaint.12\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                          Dissent follows  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11Moreover,  Trinidad was not  the supervisor  on Valentin's\r\nshift  (during  which Martinez  was  shot), but,  rather,  on the\r\nsubsequent 4:00  a.m. to  12 noon  shift.  Thus,  it is  far from\r\nclear that supervisory liability would be a  viable theory vis-a-\r\nvis Trinidad even if an underlying constitutional violation could\r\nbe shown.\r\n\n     12Of course,  the  dismissal operates  without prejudice  to\r\nwhatever  rights  plaintiff may  have  to  prosecute the  pendent\r\nclaims in the courts of  Puerto Rico.  See Feinstein v.  RTC, 942\r                                                                      \r\nF.2d 34, 47 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.

I\r\n\n  start  with  the  facts.   Although  the  majority's  factual\r\n\n  recitation  is  not  inaccurate,  it  is  not  a  full-bodied\r\n\n  portrayal of what happened.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n            Plaintiff, Martinez,  was a young (age  twenty) and\r\n\n  comparatively new member of the Puerto Rico Police Force.  On\r\n\n  the day of the events giving rise to this case, he arrived at\r\n\n  the police station  sufficiently early to  be given his  duty\r\n\n  assignment.   Martinez parked  his car in  the police parking\r\n\n  lot.   He got out of  his car and started  towards the police\r\n\n  station to get his orders for the day.  There were four other\r\n\n  police officers in the  lot:  the defendants --  Colon, V lez\r\n\n  and Trinidad -- and Valentin, who is not a defendant.  As the\r\n\n  majority  acknowledges, the defendants  were, at all relevant\r\n\n  times, on duty as  police officers and acting under  color of\r\n\n  state  law.   The three  defendants observed the  events that\r\n\n  took  place in  the parking  lot and  the police  station and\r\n\n  heard Valentin's  denigrating remarks  to Martinez.   None of\r\n\n  the defendants asked Valentin to stop his verbal and physical\r\n\n  assaults  against Martinez.  To put it starkly, they stood by\r\n\n  and  watched without protest  Valentin \"blow away\" Martinez's\r\n\n  penis.\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n            As Martinez walked across the parking lot, Valentin\r\n\n  said  to the defendants,  \"Here comes Pretty  Boy.\"  Valentin\r\n\n  then accosted Martinez, drew his service revolver, pointed it\r\n\n  directly  at  Martinez's genital  area,  cocked  it, put  his\r\n\n  finger on the trigger,  asked Martinez if he was  afraid, and\r\n\n  then  lowered the revolver.  Martinez  told Valentin:  \"Don't\r\n\n  horse around with that  because you will kill me.\"   Martinez\r\n\n  then  proceeded into the station  house.  A  short time later\r\n\n  Valentin again  confronted Martinez; this time  he pushed his\r\n\n  finger through a hole in Martinez's undershirt and ripped the\r\n\n  shirt open.  The  record does not disclose whether  any words\r\n\n  were  spoken  at this  juncture.    Martinez put  his  police\r\n\n  uniform on  and reported  to his shift  supervisor, defendant\r\n\n  Trinidad.\r\n\n            A  short   time  later  Valentin   again  assaulted\r\n\n  Martinez.     This   assault   was  similar   to  the   first\r\n\n  confrontation,  but  with  an  ominous  threat.    This  time\r\n\n  Valentin pushed  the muzzle of his loaded and cocked revolver\r\n\n  into the front of  Martinez's pants  and threatened  to \"blow\r\n\n  away\" Martinez's penis.   Valentin then asked Martinez  if he\r\n\n  was  scared.   After Valentin  withdrew the  weapon, Martinez\r\n\n  moved away from him.\r\n\n            A short time later, within minutes,  Valentin again\r\n\n  accosted Martinez.   He loaded  and cocked  his revolver  and\r\n\n  then inserted  it into  the front  of Martinez's pants  while\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\n  continuing to verbally  abuse him.   The  charade ended  when\r\n\n  Valentin's  revolver  discharged.    Valentin's  prior threat\r\n\n  became a reality; Martinez's penis was in fact blown away and\r\n\n  he was rendered permanently impotent.\r\n\n            The  majority  calls  the  shooting  accidental and\r\n\n  says,  \"All parties  agree  that  the  shooting  .  .  .  was\r\n\n  unintentional.\"    Ante at  4.    Whether  the  shooting  was\r                                   \r\n\n  accidental or not, it can  be concluded, based on  Valentin's\r\n\n  words and actions, that it was an accident  that was bound to\r\n\n  happen.  What Valentin did makes Russian roulette seem like a\r\n\n  parlor game.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n            The  majority's central  holding is  premised on  a\r\n\n  ruling that Valentin was not acting under color of state law.\r\n\n  In my view,  the facts taken  in the light most  favorable to\r\n\n  plaintiff establish  that Valentin was acting  under color of\r\n\n  state law.  \r\n\n            As  the majority  points out:   \"`[T]he traditional\r\n\n  definition of acting under  color of state law  requires that\r\n\n  the  defendant have  exercised power  possessed by  virtue of\r\n\n  state law  and made  possible only  because the  wrongdoer is\r\n\n  clothed  with the  authority  of the  state.'\"   Ante  at  13\r                                                                 \r\n\n  (quoting West  v. Atkins, 487  U.S. 42, 49  (1988)) (ellipses\r                                    \r\n\n  and  internal quotation  marks omitted).   Simply  stated, \"a\r\n\n  person  acts under  color of  state law  `when he  abuses the\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\n  position  given him by the  State.'\"  Id.  (quoting West, 487\r                                                                    \r\n\n  U.S. at 50).  I think that Valentin exercised power possessed\r\n\n  by virtue of Puerto  Rico law and made possible  only because\r\n\n  he was clothed with the authority of Puerto Rico, and that he\r\n\n  abused that power.\r\n\n            Even if  I disregard  the obvious --  that Valentin\r\n\n  was in uniform, on duty, in the police station, and used  his\r\n\n  service  revolver to commit  the tort (all  of which militate\r\n\n  heavily  in  favor  of a  finding  that  Valentin  abused his\r\n\n  position as a  police officer) --  I believe that  Valentin's\r\n\n  status as a police officer was the only reason the defendants\r\n\n  took  no action.  If Valentin  had been a private citizen and\r\n\n  had  been  tormenting  Martinez   in  the  same  manner,  the\r\n\n  bystander  officers certainly  would  have  intervened.   The\r\n\n  record gives  rise to a reasonable  inference that Valentin's\r\n\n  police-officer status led the bystander officers  to conclude\r\n\n  that:   (1) Valentin was not mentally unbalanced to the point\r\n\n  that he  might actually shoot  Martinez, but a  stable person\r\n\n  only engaged in harassment or horseplay; and (2) Valentin was\r\n\n  skilled  enough with firearms to be allowed to engage in this\r\n\n  sort of stupidity.  Consequently, the record gives rise to an\r\n\n  inference that Valentin's  police-officer status  was a  sine\r                                                                         \r\n\n  qua non of  the bystander officers' non-intervention.   In my\r                   \r\n\n  view,  this inference  establishes  that Valentin  was acting\r\n\n  under color of state law. \r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\n            The majority suggests  that Martinez's status as  a\r                                                            \r\n\n  police  officer somehow reduced  the likelihood that Martinez\r\n\n  perceived Valentin  to be acting  with the imprimatur  of the\r\n\n  Commonwealth.  See  id. at 17  n.6.  I  believe the  opposite\r                                   \r\n\n  conclusion is  at least  as likely  to be  true.   After  the\r\n\n  bystander officers  (including Trinidad, who  had supervisory\r\n\n  authority) failed  to intervene during the  initial rounds of\r\n\n  abuse by  Valentin, Martinez  could well have  concluded that\r\n\n  this  type of hazing of  young officers was  standard fare in\r\n\n  the Loiza  Street Precinct.   Therefore, Martinez  could well\r\n\n  have  believed that the Commonwealth acquiesced in Valentin's\r\n\n  actions.\r\n\n            Because Valentin  was acting  under color  of state\r\n\n  law,  I think  it pellucid  that DeShaney  does not  bar this\r                                                     \r\n\n  suit.    At most,  DeShaney  precludes  civil rights  actions\r                                       \r\n\n  against state actors under the Due Process Clause for failing\r\n\n  to protect an individual against  private violence.  See  489\r                                                                    \r\n\n  U.S. at 197.  The DeShaney majority took pains to distinguish\r                                      \r\n\n  the case before  it from situations  where the state  itself,\r\n\n  through its own affirmative action prior to the complained-of\r\n\n  non-intervention, limited the victim's  freedom.  Id. at 198-\r                                                                 \r\n\n  201 (contrasting situations where the state has taken custody\r\n\n  of   certain   individuals   and   thereby   incurred   \"some\r\n\n  responsibility for  [their] safety and  well-being\").   Here,\r\n\n  the  Commonwealth,  acting through  the  person of  Valentin,\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n  compromised Martinez's freedom by successively assaulting him\r\n\n  three  times with a loaded  service revolver.   See West, 487\r                                                                    \r\n\n  U.S. at  49.   In my  view, this  infringement was  more than\r\n\n  sufficient  to support  Martinez's  substantive  due  process\r\n\n  claim.   DeShaney, 489 U.S.  at 200 (\"In  the substantive due\r                             \r\n\n  process  analysis,  it  is  the State's  affirmative  act  of\r\n\n  restraining the individual's freedom to act on his own behalf\r\n\n  --  through  incarceration,  institutionalization,  or  other\r\n\n  similar  restraint  of  personal  liberty  --  which  is  the\r\n\n  `deprivation of  liberty' triggering the  protections of  the\r\n\n  Due Process Clause.\").   \r\n\n            I believe it important to comment on three discrete\r\n\n  parts of the  majority opinion.   The majority concedes  that\r\n\n  Valentin's use  of his service revolver  might arguably bring\r\n\n  his actions within the color of state law.  Ante at 16.  This\r                                                            \r\n\n  is  then rejected on two grounds:   that it was not raised in\r\n\n  the district court or plaintiff's appellate brief; and on the\r\n\n  merits.  I cannot help but wonder why the straw man  approach\r\n\n  was used.  In any event, I disagree on both grounds.\r\n\n            Fairly   construed,    Martinez's   argument   that\r\n\n  Valentin's status  as an  on-duty police  officer made  him a\r\n\n  state actor incorporates the  argument that Valentin used the\r\n\n  indicia  and  tools  of  his  trade  (including  his  service\r\n\n  revolver) to  carry out the shooting.   For me,  this is more\r\n\n  than enough to  allow us  to consider Valentin's  use of  his\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\n  service  revolver as a factor in determining whether he was a\r\n\n  state actor.\r\n\n            I  am also  am troubled  by the  majority's finding\r\n\n  that  Martinez waived his equal protection claim.  Id. at 22.\r                                                                  \r\n\n  As an initial  matter, I think it important to state that the\r\n\n  claim appears to have some substance.  How, after all, can it\r\n\n  be rational  for bystander  officers not to  intervene simply\r\n\n  because one  of their own --  as opposed to a  civilian -- is\r\n\n  being   victimized  by  violence?     What  legitimate  state\r\n\n  objective could such inaction serve?\r\n\n            The majority  finds  that Martinez  abandoned  this\r\n\n  claim because he failed to  \"embellish\" it sufficiently.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  I do  not think that the  issue needed any  embellishing.  It\r\n\n  was called  an equal  protection claim and  stated relatively\r\n\n  clearly:  \"If Wilfredo  had been a private citizen,  it seems\r\n\n  clear that defendants-appellees would have realized that they\r\n\n  were obliged under the law to protect  him from the threat of\r\n\n  serious damages.\"  Appellant's Brief at 9.  In my view,  this\r\n\n  was sufficient to put the claim in issue.\r\n\n            Finally,  I  think  it   important  to  refute  the\r\n\n  majority's  suggestion  that  Valentin might  not  have  been\r\n\n  acting under color  of state law even if Martinez  had been a\r                                                    \r\n\n  civilian.   Ante  at 17  n.6 (\"Had  Martinez been  a civilian\r                            \r\n\n  rather than a fellow  officer, the significance of Valentin's\r\n\n  uniform   and  weapon   for  purposes  of   the  color-of-law\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\n  determination  might  well  have  been  greater.\")  (emphasis\r                                                  \r\n\n  supplied).   I find the suggestion remarkable.  If a civilian\r\n\n  had suffered the  abuse Martinez experienced at  the hands of\r\n\n  an  on-duty,  uniformed  police  officer  using  his  service\r                                                                         \r\n\n  revolver  in front  of other  officers in  a police  station,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  well-settled  precedent  would  dictate a  finding  that  the\r\n\n  civilian  was victimized under color of state law.  We should\r\n\n  not even hint that this may not be so.\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n            I also cannot agree with the majority's  conclusion\r\n\n  that  an  unargued  qualified  immunity  theory  provides  an\r\n\n  alternative ground for affirmance  in this case.  See  id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n  18-20.\r\n\n            Under the qualified immunity  doctrine, \"government\r\n\n  officials performing discretionary functions[]  generally are\r\n\n  shielded from  liability for  civil damages insofar  as their\r\n\n  conduct  does not  violate  clearly established  statutory or\r\n\n  constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\r\n\n  known.\"  Harlow v.  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  In\r                                          \r\n\n  determining whether a right  was \"clearly established\" at the\r\n\n  relevant  point  in  time,  courts must  analyze  it  at  the\r\n\n  appropriate  level  of specificity.    Thus, a  right  is not\r\n\n  \"clearly established\" for qualified immunity  purposes unless\r\n\n  its  contours are  sufficiently clear  so \"that  a reasonable\r\n\n                                33\r\r\n\n  official would understand that what he is doing violated that\r\n\n  right.\"  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).\r                                          \r\n\n            The majority suggests that Martinez's right to have\r\n\n  the bystander  officers intervene on his  behalf was \"cloaked\r\n\n  in uncertainty\" and was  \"murky\" at the time of  the relevant\r\n\n  events.   I  disagree.   As  the  majority concedes,  it  was\r\n\n  settled at the time of the events in this case that \r\n\n            [a]n officer who is present  at the scene\r\n            [of  an  arrest]  and who  fails  to take\r\n            reasonable steps to protect the victim of\r\n            another officer's use of  excessive force\r\n            can be held liable under section 1983 for\r\n            his nonfeasance,  provided that he  had a\r\n            realistic  opportunity   to  prevent  the\r\n            other officer's actions.   \r\n\n  Ante at  9 (citations and internal  quotation marks omitted).\r                \r\n\n  In my view, this line of authority controls here.  \r\n\n            The  majority  distinguishes   this  precedent   by\r\n\n  suggesting  that it  is  inapplicable  where  the  tortfeasor\r\n\n  officer is not acting under the  color of state law, and then\r\n\n  concludes  that Valentin  was not  so acting  here.   For the\r\n\n  reasons I have explained above (and despite the opinion of my\r\n\n  esteemed  colleagues), I  do  not think  that an  objectively\r\n\n  reasonable police officer could have seen Valentin's  actions\r\n\n  as purely private.  And because Valentin was acting under the\r\n\n  color  of  state  law,   the  aforementioned  authority   was\r\n\n  sufficient to have informed defendants of their obligation to\r\n\n  intervene  on Martinez's behalf.   See Anderson,  483 U.S. at\r                                                           \r\n\n  640 (\"This is not to say that an official action is protected\r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\n  by qualified immunity unless the very  action in question has\r\n\n  previously been held unlawful, but  it is to say that  in the\r\n\n  light   of  pre-existing   law   the  unlawfulness   must  be\r\n\n  apparent.\")  (citation omitted).   If excessive  force during\r\n\n  the course of  a lawful arrest requires  intervention, so too\r\n\n  should an  assault with a  deadly weapon taking  place during\r\n\n  the  course of  an entirely  unlawful seizure.    I therefore\r                                                 \r\n\n  disagree with the majority's qualified immunity analysis.\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n            Police  officers are entrusted with great powers --\r\n\n  including the privileged use of force -- for the very purpose\r\n\n  of preventing lawless violence.  When an officer abuses those\r\n\n  powers in front  of his  peers, he in  effect presumes  their\r\n\n  tacit  acquiescence,  if  not  outright approval.    In  this\r\n\n  situation, the  other officers have a  constitutional duty to\r\n\n  intervene.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\r\n\n                                35\r\r\n",

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Consistent  with the method of  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56, we\r\n\ncanvass the material facts in a light that flatters, but does not\r\n\nimpermissibly distort,  the plaintiff's claims.   We then recount\r\n\nthe travel of the case.\r\n\n                          A.  The Facts.\r                                    A.  The Facts.\r                                                 \r\n\n          We outline  the facts, omitting the  graphic details on\r\n\nwhich  our dissenting  brother prefers  to dwell.   In  our view,\r\n\nthese  details  are not  relevant to  the  legal issues  posed on\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n          In the early morning hours  of May 26, 1988, plaintiff-\r\n\nappellant  Wilfredo Martinez  Rodriguez  (Martinez),  a  youthful\r\n\nmember of Puerto Rico's  police force, drove to the  Loiza Street\r\n\nPrecinct,  located in  the  San Juan  metropolitan area.   Though\r\n\nMartinez was not scheduled to begin his shift until 4:00 a.m., he\r\n\narrived  early, pursuant to local custom, in order to procure his\r\n\npost  assignment.  Martinez alleges that he  was on duty from the\r\n\nmoment  he arrived    even before his shift  began   because from\r\n\nthat  point  forward he  was  subject  to  the shift  commander's\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\norders.\r\n\n          Upon  Martinez' arrival,  a fellow  officer who  was on\r\n\nduty at  the time,  Angel Valentin Corali  (Valentin), approached\r\n\nMartinez' car and called him \"pretty boy\" (\"papito lindo\").  When\r\n\nMartinez alighted, Valentin drew his service revolver, pointed it\r\n\nat Martinez' stomach, cocked the hammer, placed his finger on the\r\n\ntrigger,  and  inquired if  Martinez was  afraid.   Valentin then\r\n\ndisarmed  the weapon,  and Martinez  hurried inside  the station,\r\n\nfirst telling  Valentin:  \"Don't  horse around with  that because\r\n\nyou will kill me.\"\r\n\n          Shortly  after  this  fracas  had   occurred,  Valentin\r\n\naccosted Martinez in the  radio room, inserted his finger  into a\r\n\nsmall hole in Martinez'  undershirt, and ripped it.   Once again,\r\n\nMartinez walked away  from Valentin.   He then  changed into  his\r\n\nuniform, entered  the waiting  room, and  reported  to his  shift\r\n\nsupervisor, defendant-appellee Juan Trinidad Marrero (Trinidad).\r\n\n          Soon  thereafter,  Valentin  reappeared,   pointed  his\r\n\nrevolver at Martinez' genitals, cocked  the hammer, and, with his\r\n\nfinger on the trigger, threatened to \"blow away\" Martinez'  penis\r\n\n(asking  him, somewhat  rhetorically, if  he was  scared).   When\r\n\nValentin lowered the weapon, Martinez immediately moved away from\r\n\nhim.   Within minutes Valentin again  approached Martinez, cocked\r\n\nthe  revolver,  aimed  it  at Martinez'  groin,  and  resumed his\r\n\ntaunting.     The   revolver  accidentally   discharged,  maiming\r\n\nMartinez.\r\n\n          The  first  encounter  took  place  in  the  precinct's\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nparking lot and  the rest transpired  inside the police  station.\r\n\nAccording to Martinez, roughly  twenty minutes elapsed from start\r\n\nto finish.  All  parties agree that the shooting,  which occurred\r\n\nbefore the 4:00 a.m. shift change, was unintentional.1\r\n\n                     B.  Travel of the Case.\r                               B.  Travel of the Case.\r                                                     \r\n\n          On  May  22,  1989,  Martinez  filed  suit  in  federal\r\n\ndistrict  court  against   numerous  defendants,  including,   as\r\n\nrelevant here, Rafael Colon Pizarro (Colon), Luis A. Velez Rentas\r\n\n(Velez),  and  Trinidad  (collectively, \"the  officers\"  or  \"the\r\n\ndefendants\").2     Invoking  42  U.S.C.      1983  and  premising\r\n\njurisdiction  on the  existence  of a  federal  question, see  28\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.     1331  (1988), he  alleged  that  his  rights had  been\r\n\nabridged in that each  defendant owed him a duty to intervene and\r\n\nprotect  him  from readily  discernible harm  at  the hands  of a\r\n\nfellow  officer,  but  each   defendant  breached  this  duty  by\r\n\nsubsequent  inaction.3   Martinez  asserted  pendent tort  claims\r\n\nwith respect  to  all  three  defendants  and,  with  respect  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In  his memorandum of law  in support of  his opposition to\r\ndefendant  Carlos Lopez-Feliciano's  motion to  dismiss, Martinez\r\nstated that  \"the revolver apparently fired by accident.\"  Record\r\nAppendix  at  21.   At  any  rate,  the  summary judgment  record\r\ncontains no facts that would support a contrary finding; and, for\r\naught  that appears,  Martinez has  never asserted  that Valentin\r\nshot him intentionally.\r\n\n     2Plaintiff asserted claims against several other defendants,\r\nincluding  Valentin and  Lopez-Feliciano.   Those claims  are not\r\nbefore us, and we ignore them for purposes of this opinion.\r\n\n     3Although  the underlying  facts  are  hotly  contested,  we\r\nassume  for purposes of this  appeal, as Martinez  would have it,\r\nthat  all three  defendants witnessed  the entire  progression of\r\nevents and had a meaningful opportunity to intervene at each step\r\nalong the way.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nTrinidad,  asserted a  section  1983 claim  based on  supervisory\r\n\nliability.\r\n\n          After  a  flurry of  pretrial  discovery,  the officers\r\n\nmoved for  summary  judgment.   They  argued,  inter  alia,  that\r                                                                    \r\n\nValentin was not acting under color  of state law when the mishap\r\n\noccurred; and that, therefore,  onlooker officers did not have  a\r\n\nconstitutional  duty  to  intervene  on Martinez'  behalf.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court   referred  the  motions  and   Martinez'  timely\r\n\nopposition to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate concluded that,\r\n\nunder DeShaney, the officers  had no constitutional obligation to\r                        \r\n\nprotect Martinez from Valentin's  actions, and urged the district\r\n\ncourt to grant summary  judgment.  The plaintiff objected  to the\r\n\nmagistrate's report and  recommendation, but the  district court,\r\n\naffording de novo review, see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 72(b), adopted the\r                                       \r\n\nreport,  accepted   the  recommendation,  and   entered  judgment\r\n\naccordingly.  This appeal followed.\r\n\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\n          A district  court may  grant summary judgment  only \"if\r\n\nthe  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\r\n\nadmissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\r\n\nthat there is  no genuine issue as to any  material fact and that\r\n\nthe  moving party is entitled to a  judgment as a matter of law.\"\r\n\nFed.  R. Civ. P.  56(c). We have  charted the boundaries  of this\r\n\nrule in case after  case, see, e.g., Coyne  v. Taber Partners  I,\r                                                                          \r\n\n    F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1995) [No. 94-2231, slip op. at 4-5];\r\n\nNational Amusements, Inc.  v.

Since the plaintiff has not\r\n\nalleged the transgression  of any  right secured to  him under  a\r\n\nfederal  statute,  we  may  narrow  the  inquiry  still  further,\r\n\nlimiting   it  to  whether  the  facts  show  a  violation  of  a\r\n\nconstitutional right.   It is  to this elusive  question that  we\r\n\nnext proceed.\r\n\n                    A.  The Duty to Intervene.\r                              A.

There,  a child sued  for damages under 42\r                              \r\n\nU.S.C.     1983, claiming  that employees  of a  state-run social\r\n\nservice  agency,  on  notice  of  a  parent's  abusive  behavior,\r\n\nnonetheless  failed  to  protect   the  child  from  the  readily\r\n\nforeseeable danger.   See DeShaney, 489  U.S. at 193.   The Court\r                                            \r\n\naffirmed  the entry  of  summary judgment  in defendants'  favor.\r\n\nChief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, explained that\r\n\nthe Due Process Clause  ordinarily does not require the  state to\r\n\nprotect  an  individual's life,  limb,  or  property against  the\r\n\nmarauding of third parties not acting to the state's behoof.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at  196.   Consequently, \"a  State's  failure to  protect an\r             \r\n\nindividual against private violence  simply does not constitute a\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nviolation of the Due Process Clause.\"  Id. at 197.\r                                                    \r\n\n          Although the  DeShaney Court left open  the possibility\r                                          \r\n\nof  certain  circumscribed  exceptions  to the  general  rule  of\r\n\nnonliability,  Martinez makes no effort to slide within them.

Of\r\n\ncourse,  police officers  sometimes have  an affirmative  duty to\r                                             \r\n\nintervene  that is enforceable under the Due Process Clause.

Instead,  such  cases escape  the  rule\r                          \r\n\nbecause the aggressor is acting under color of his public office.\r\n\n          Gaudreault illustrates the point.  The quoted statement\r                              \r\n\nspecifically  contemplates that  the underlying  tortious conduct\r\n\ntake  place within the  context of  an arrest,  interrogation, or\r\n\nsimilar  maneuver, see Gaudreault, 923  F.2d at 206-07  &amp; n.3, in\r                                           \r\n\nwhich a differential  exists between the  victim and the  officer\r\n\nprecisely  because of  the latter's  status  as one  empowered to\r\n\nenforce  the law,  coercively if  necessary, against  the former.\r\n\nSimilarly, O'Neill involved  the beating of  a handcuffed man  by\r                            \r\n\nlaw enforcement officers during an interrogation in the detention\r\n\narea of  a police station.   See  O'Neill, 839  F.2d at  10.   We\r                                                   \r\n\ncannot imagine  a more  paradigmatic exercise of  state authority\r\n\nthan the processes of handcuffing, detaining, and interrogating a\r\n\ncitizen.   Gaudreault and O'Neill,  then, are cases  in which the\r                                           \r\n\naggressor is acting under color of  state law.

After  all, DeShaney  had not  yet been\r                                                        \r\n\ndecided; thus,  the whole  question of  a constitutional duty  to\r\n\nintervene  was  cloaked  in  uncertainty.    Even now,  with  the\r\n\nguidance furnished by the DeShaney Court, the precise contours of\r                                            \r\n\nthe  rule  as  it   applies  to  onlooker  officers   are  murky.\r\n\nConsequently,  even if Martinez had  some basis for  a claim that\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nthe  defendants owed him a duty grounded in the Constitution, the\r\n\ndimensions of  the right  were dimly  perceived (if  perceived at\r\n\nall).    It  follows  inexorably  that  the  defendants would  be\r\n\nentitled  to qualified  immunity and,  hence, entitled  to brevis\r                                                                           \r\n\ndisposition.\r\n\n                       D.

All  are unavailing.\r\n\nWe mention three of them (rejecting the remainder without further\r\n\nelaboration).\r\n\n          1.   Violation of Local  Law.  Martinez  urges that the\r                    1.

Laws Ann.  tit. 25,    1003 (1980),7  furnishes a basis  for\r\n\nliability under 42 U.S.C.   1983.  He is wrong.\r\n\n          It  is established  beyond  peradventure  that a  state\r\n\nactor's  failure to observe a duty imposed by state law, standing\r\n\nalone, is not a sufficient foundation on which to erect a section\r\n\n1983 claim.   See, e.g., Amsden,  904 F.2d at  757; Chongris, 811\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  at  42-43.

The\r\n\nConstitution  is a  charter  of carefully  enumerated rights  and\r\n\nresponsibilities,  defining the  relationship between  the people\r\n\nand  a government of limited  powers.

CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.  Because the defendants' failure\r\n\nto intervene and protect the plaintiff against Valentin's private\r\n\nactions,  though regrettable,  cannot  be said  to have  violated\r\n\nrights   secured  to   the   plaintiff  by   the  United   States\r\n\nConstitution,  see DeShaney,  489  U.S. at  196-97, the  district\r                                     \r\n\ncourt did not err  in summarily disposing of the  federal claims.\r\n\nAnd, once the court determined so far in advance of trial that no\r\n\nlegitimate federal question existed, the jurisdictional basis for\r\n\nplaintiff's pendent claims under Puerto Rico law evaporated.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBrennan, 888 F.2d at 196.  Thus, the court properly dismissed the\r                 \r\n\nbalance of the complaint.12\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                          Dissent follows  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11Moreover,  Trinidad was not  the supervisor  on Valentin's\r\nshift  (during  which Martinez  was  shot), but,  rather,  on the\r\nsubsequent 4:00  a.m. to  12 noon  shift.  Thus,  it is  far from\r\nclear that supervisory liability would be a  viable theory vis-a-\r\nvis Trinidad even if an underlying constitutional violation could\r\nbe shown.\r\n\n     12Of course,  the  dismissal operates  without prejudice  to\r\nwhatever  rights  plaintiff may  have  to  prosecute the  pendent\r\nclaims in the courts of  Puerto Rico.

I\r\n\n  start  with  the  facts.   Although  the  majority's  factual\r\n\n  recitation  is  not  inaccurate,  it  is  not  a  full-bodied\r\n\n  portrayal of what happened.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n            Plaintiff, Martinez,  was a young (age  twenty) and\r\n\n  comparatively new member of the Puerto Rico Police Force.  On\r\n\n  the day of the events giving rise to this case, he arrived at\r\n\n  the police station  sufficiently early to  be given his  duty\r\n\n  assignment.   Martinez parked  his car in  the police parking\r\n\n  lot.   He got out of  his car and started  towards the police\r\n\n  station to get his orders for the day.  There were four other\r\n\n  police officers in the  lot:  the defendants --  Colon, V lez\r\n\n  and Trinidad -- and Valentin, who is not a defendant.  As the\r\n\n  majority  acknowledges, the defendants  were, at all relevant\r\n\n  times, on duty as  police officers and acting under  color of\r\n\n  state  law.   The three  defendants observed the  events that\r\n\n  took  place in  the parking  lot and  the police  station and\r\n\n  heard Valentin's  denigrating remarks  to Martinez.   None of\r\n\n  the defendants asked Valentin to stop his verbal and physical\r\n\n  assaults  against Martinez.  To put it starkly, they stood by\r\n\n  and  watched without protest  Valentin \"blow away\" Martinez's\r\n\n  penis.\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n            As Martinez walked across the parking lot, Valentin\r\n\n  said  to the defendants,  \"Here comes Pretty  Boy.\"  Valentin\r\n\n  then accosted Martinez, drew his service revolver, pointed it\r\n\n  directly  at  Martinez's genital  area,  cocked  it, put  his\r\n\n  finger on the trigger,  asked Martinez if he was  afraid, and\r\n\n  then  lowered the revolver.  Martinez  told Valentin:  \"Don't\r\n\n  horse around with that  because you will kill me.\"   Martinez\r\n\n  then  proceeded into the station  house.  A  short time later\r\n\n  Valentin again  confronted Martinez; this time  he pushed his\r\n\n  finger through a hole in Martinez's undershirt and ripped the\r\n\n  shirt open.  The  record does not disclose whether  any words\r\n\n  were  spoken  at this  juncture.    Martinez put  his  police\r\n\n  uniform on  and reported  to his shift  supervisor, defendant\r\n\n  Trinidad.\r\n\n            A  short   time  later  Valentin   again  assaulted\r\n\n  Martinez.     This   assault   was  similar   to  the   first\r\n\n  confrontation,  but  with  an  ominous  threat.    This  time\r\n\n  Valentin pushed  the muzzle of his loaded and cocked revolver\r\n\n  into the front of  Martinez's pants  and threatened  to \"blow\r\n\n  away\" Martinez's penis.   Valentin then asked Martinez  if he\r\n\n  was  scared.   After Valentin  withdrew the  weapon, Martinez\r\n\n  moved away from him.\r\n\n            A short time later, within minutes,  Valentin again\r\n\n  accosted Martinez.   He loaded  and cocked  his revolver  and\r\n\n  then inserted  it into  the front  of Martinez's pants  while\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\n  continuing to verbally  abuse him.   The  charade ended  when\r\n\n  Valentin's  revolver  discharged.    Valentin's  prior threat\r\n\n  became a reality; Martinez's penis was in fact blown away and\r\n\n  he was rendered permanently impotent.\r\n\n            The  majority  calls  the  shooting  accidental and\r\n\n  says,  \"All parties  agree  that  the  shooting  .  .  .  was\r\n\n  unintentional.\"    Ante at  4.    Whether  the  shooting  was\r                                   \r\n\n  accidental or not, it can  be concluded, based on  Valentin's\r\n\n  words and actions, that it was an accident  that was bound to\r\n\n  happen.  What Valentin did makes Russian roulette seem like a\r\n\n  parlor game.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n            The  majority's central  holding is  premised on  a\r\n\n  ruling that Valentin was not acting under color of state law.\r\n\n  In my view,  the facts taken  in the light most  favorable to\r\n\n  plaintiff establish  that Valentin was acting  under color of\r\n\n  state law.  \r\n\n            As  the majority  points out:   \"`[T]he traditional\r\n\n  definition of acting under  color of state law  requires that\r\n\n  the  defendant have  exercised power  possessed by  virtue of\r\n\n  state law  and made  possible only  because the  wrongdoer is\r\n\n  clothed  with the  authority  of the  state.'\"   Ante  at  13\r                                                                 \r\n\n  (quoting West  v.

Simply  stated, \"a\r\n\n  person  acts under  color of  state law  `when he  abuses the\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\n  position  given him by the  State.'\"  Id.  (quoting West, 487\r                                                                    \r\n\n  U.S. at 50).  I think that Valentin exercised power possessed\r\n\n  by virtue of Puerto  Rico law and made possible  only because\r\n\n  he was clothed with the authority of Puerto Rico, and that he\r\n\n  abused that power.\r\n\n            Even if  I disregard  the obvious --  that Valentin\r\n\n  was in uniform, on duty, in the police station, and used  his\r\n\n  service  revolver to commit  the tort (all  of which militate\r\n\n  heavily  in  favor  of a  finding  that  Valentin  abused his\r\n\n  position as a  police officer) --  I believe that  Valentin's\r\n\n  status as a police officer was the only reason the defendants\r\n\n  took  no action.  If Valentin  had been a private citizen and\r\n\n  had  been  tormenting  Martinez   in  the  same  manner,  the\r\n\n  bystander  officers certainly  would  have  intervened.   The\r\n\n  record gives  rise to a reasonable  inference that Valentin's\r\n\n  police-officer status led the bystander officers  to conclude\r\n\n  that:   (1) Valentin was not mentally unbalanced to the point\r\n\n  that he  might actually shoot  Martinez, but a  stable person\r\n\n  only engaged in harassment or horseplay; and (2) Valentin was\r\n\n  skilled  enough with firearms to be allowed to engage in this\r\n\n  sort of stupidity.  Consequently, the record gives rise to an\r\n\n  inference that Valentin's  police-officer status  was a  sine\r                                                                         \r\n\n  qua non of  the bystander officers' non-intervention.   In my\r                   \r\n\n  view,  this inference  establishes  that Valentin  was acting\r\n\n  under color of state law. \r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\n            The majority suggests  that Martinez's status as  a\r                                                            \r\n\n  police  officer somehow reduced  the likelihood that Martinez\r\n\n  perceived Valentin  to be acting  with the imprimatur  of the\r\n\n  Commonwealth.  See  id. at 17  n.6.  I  believe the  opposite\r                                   \r\n\n  conclusion is  at least  as likely  to be  true.   After  the\r\n\n  bystander officers  (including Trinidad, who  had supervisory\r\n\n  authority) failed  to intervene during the  initial rounds of\r\n\n  abuse by  Valentin, Martinez  could well have  concluded that\r\n\n  this  type of hazing of  young officers was  standard fare in\r\n\n  the Loiza  Street Precinct.   Therefore, Martinez  could well\r\n\n  have  believed that the Commonwealth acquiesced in Valentin's\r\n\n  actions.\r\n\n            Because Valentin  was acting  under color  of state\r\n\n  law,  I think  it pellucid  that DeShaney  does not  bar this\r                                                     \r\n\n  suit.    At most,  DeShaney  precludes  civil rights  actions\r                                       \r\n\n  against state actors under the Due Process Clause for failing\r\n\n  to protect an individual against  private violence.  See  489\r                                                                    \r\n\n  U.S. at 197.  The DeShaney majority took pains to distinguish\r                                      \r\n\n  the case before  it from situations  where the state  itself,\r\n\n  through its own affirmative action prior to the complained-of\r\n\n  non-intervention, limited the victim's  freedom.  Id. at 198-\r                                                                 \r\n\n  201 (contrasting situations where the state has taken custody\r\n\n  of   certain   individuals   and   thereby   incurred   \"some\r\n\n  responsibility for  [their] safety and  well-being\").

See West, 487\r                                                                    \r\n\n  U.S. at  49.   In my  view, this  infringement was  more than\r\n\n  sufficient  to support  Martinez's  substantive  due  process\r\n\n  claim.   DeShaney, 489 U.S.  at 200 (\"In  the substantive due\r                             \r\n\n  process  analysis,  it  is  the State's  affirmative  act  of\r\n\n  restraining the individual's freedom to act on his own behalf\r\n\n  --  through  incarceration,  institutionalization,  or  other\r\n\n  similar  restraint  of  personal  liberty  --  which  is  the\r\n\n  `deprivation of  liberty' triggering the  protections of  the\r\n\n  Due Process Clause.\").   \r\n\n            I believe it important to comment on three discrete\r\n\n  parts of the  majority opinion.   The majority concedes  that\r\n\n  Valentin's use  of his service revolver  might arguably bring\r\n\n  his actions within the color of state law.  Ante at 16.  This\r                                                            \r\n\n  is  then rejected on two grounds:   that it was not raised in\r\n\n  the district court or plaintiff's appellate brief; and on the\r\n\n  merits.  I cannot help but wonder why the straw man  approach\r\n\n  was used.  In any event, I disagree on both grounds.\r\n\n            Fairly   construed,    Martinez's   argument   that\r\n\n  Valentin's status  as an  on-duty police  officer made  him a\r\n\n  state actor incorporates the  argument that Valentin used the\r\n\n  indicia  and  tools  of  his  trade  (including  his  service\r\n\n  revolver) to  carry out the shooting.   For me,  this is more\r\n\n  than enough to  allow us  to consider Valentin's  use of  his\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\n  service  revolver as a factor in determining whether he was a\r\n\n  state actor.\r\n\n            I  am also  am troubled  by the  majority's finding\r\n\n  that  Martinez waived his equal protection claim.  Id. at 22.\r                                                                  \r\n\n  As an initial  matter, I think it important to state that the\r\n\n  claim appears to have some substance.  How, after all, can it\r\n\n  be rational  for bystander  officers not to  intervene simply\r\n\n  because one  of their own --  as opposed to a  civilian -- is\r\n\n  being   victimized  by  violence?     What  legitimate  state\r\n\n  objective could such inaction serve?\r\n\n            The majority  finds  that Martinez  abandoned  this\r\n\n  claim because he failed to  \"embellish\" it sufficiently.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  I do  not think that the  issue needed any  embellishing.  It\r\n\n  was called  an equal  protection claim and  stated relatively\r\n\n  clearly:  \"If Wilfredo  had been a private citizen,  it seems\r\n\n  clear that defendants-appellees would have realized that they\r\n\n  were obliged under the law to protect  him from the threat of\r\n\n  serious damages.\"  Appellant's Brief at 9.  In my view,  this\r\n\n  was sufficient to put the claim in issue.\r\n\n            Finally,  I  think  it   important  to  refute  the\r\n\n  majority's  suggestion  that  Valentin might  not  have  been\r\n\n  acting under color  of state law even if Martinez  had been a\r                                                    \r\n\n  civilian.   Ante  at 17  n.6 (\"Had  Martinez been  a civilian\r                            \r\n\n  rather than a fellow  officer, the significance of Valentin's\r\n\n  uniform   and  weapon   for  purposes  of   the  color-of-law\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\n  determination  might  well  have  been  greater.\")  (emphasis\r                                                  \r\n\n  supplied).   I find the suggestion remarkable.  If a civilian\r\n\n  had suffered the  abuse Martinez experienced at  the hands of\r\n\n  an  on-duty,  uniformed  police  officer  using  his  service\r                                                                         \r\n\n  revolver  in front  of other  officers in  a police  station,\r                                                                        \r\n\n  well-settled  precedent  would  dictate a  finding  that  the\r\n\n  civilian  was victimized under color of state law.  We should\r\n\n  not even hint that this may not be so.\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n            I also cannot agree with the majority's  conclusion\r\n\n  that  an  unargued  qualified  immunity  theory  provides  an\r\n\n  alternative ground for affirmance  in this case.  See  id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n  18-20.\r\n\n            Under the qualified immunity  doctrine, \"government\r\n\n  officials performing discretionary functions[]  generally are\r\n\n  shielded from  liability for  civil damages insofar  as their\r\n\n  conduct  does not  violate  clearly established  statutory or\r\n\n  constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\r\n\n  known.\"  Harlow v.

I  disagree.   As  the  majority concedes,  it  was\r\n\n  settled at the time of the events in this case that \r\n\n            [a]n officer who is present  at the scene\r\n            [of  an  arrest]  and who  fails  to take\r\n            reasonable steps to protect the victim of\r\n            another officer's use of  excessive force\r\n            can be held liable under section 1983 for\r\n            his nonfeasance,  provided that he  had a\r\n            realistic  opportunity   to  prevent  the\r\n            other officer's actions.   \r\n\n  Ante at  9 (citations and internal  quotation marks omitted).\r                \r\n\n  In my view, this line of authority controls here.  \r\n\n            The  majority  distinguishes   this  precedent   by\r\n\n  suggesting  that it  is  inapplicable  where  the  tortfeasor\r\n\n  officer is not acting under the  color of state law, and then\r\n\n  concludes  that Valentin  was not  so acting  here.   For the\r\n\n  reasons I have explained above (and despite the opinion of my\r\n\n  esteemed  colleagues), I  do  not think  that an  objectively\r\n\n  reasonable police officer could have seen Valentin's  actions\r\n\n  as purely private.  And because Valentin was acting under the\r\n\n  color  of  state  law,   the  aforementioned  authority   was\r\n\n  sufficient to have informed defendants of their obligation to\r\n\n  intervene  on Martinez's behalf.   See Anderson,  483 U.S. at\r                                                           \r\n\n  640 (\"This is not to say that an official action is protected\r\n\n                                34\r\r\n\n  by qualified immunity unless the very  action in question has\r\n\n  previously been held unlawful, but  it is to say that  in the\r\n\n  light   of  pre-existing   law   the  unlawfulness   must  be\r\n\n  apparent.\")  (citation omitted).   If excessive  force during\r\n\n  the course of  a lawful arrest requires  intervention, so too\r\n\n  should an  assault with a  deadly weapon taking  place during\r\n\n  the  course of  an entirely  unlawful seizure.    I therefore\r                                                 \r\n\n  disagree with the majority's qualified immunity analysis.\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n            Police  officers are entrusted with great powers --\r\n\n  including the privileged use of force -- for the very purpose\r\n\n  of preventing lawless violence.  When an officer abuses those\r\n\n  powers in front  of his  peers, he in  effect presumes  their\r\n\n  tacit  acquiescence,  if  not  outright approval.    In  this\r\n\n  situation, the  other officers have a  constitutional duty to\r\n\n  intervene.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\r\n\n                                35\r\r\n</pre>",
