Craig Lawrence,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney. Jane M. Lyons, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, entered an appearance.\n\n    Before: TATEL, GRIFFITH, and KAVANAUGH, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n    Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge KAVANAUGH.\n\f                               2\n     KAVANAUGH, Circuit Judge: The Government charges\nfees to process FOIA requests. Those fees can be significant –\nin this case about $900 – and can deter or prevent citizens from\nmaking FOIA requests.\n\n      By statute, educational institutions are eligible for\nreduced fees when they make FOIA requests.                   The\nGovernment has long determined that teachers who make\nFOIA requests are eligible for those reduced fees because\nteachers are part of an educational institution. But at the same\ntime, the Government has determined that students who make\nFOIA requests are not eligible for those reduced fees because\nthey are supposedly not part of an educational institution.\n\n     We disagree with the Government’s slicing of the term\n“educational institution.” If teachers can qualify for reduced\nfees, so can students. Students who make FOIA requests to\nfurther their coursework or other school-sponsored activities\nare eligible for reduced fees under FOIA because students, like\nteachers, are part of an educational institution. The student\ninvolved in this case, Kathryn Sack, therefore is eligible for\nreduced fees for her FOIA requests. We reverse the contrary\njudgment of the District Court on that question, and affirm in\nall other respects.\n\n                               I\n\n    While pursuing her Ph.D. in Politics at the University of\nVirginia, Kathryn Sack submitted FOIA requests to the\nDepartment of Defense. 1 Sack sought Department reports\nabout its use of polygraph examinations, as well as related\n\n   1\n         To be precise, Sack submitted the requests to multiple\nagencies within the Department. For ease of reference, we will\nrefer to the agencies as “the Department.”\n\f                              3\ndocuments about those examinations.          Sack told the\nDepartment that she intended to use the requested information\nfor her dissertation on polygraph bias.\n\n    Sack asked the Department to categorize her as an\neducational-institution requester. Under FOIA, government\nagencies may charge fees for processing FOIA requests. But\nFOIA limits the fees that an agency may charge for processing\nFOIA requests made by an educational institution.\n\n    For one batch of Sack’s requests, the Department of\nDefense     refused      to    categorize    Sack      as    an\neducational-institution requester and required her to pay about\n$900 to conduct the search. For another batch of Sack’s\nrequests, the Department conducted a search and reviewed\nresponsive documents, but the Department informed Sack that\nthe documents were exempt from disclosure under FOIA\nExemption (7)(E).\n\n    Sack filed a lawsuit challenging the Department’s\nhandling of those two batches of requests. As to the first,\nSack asked to be categorized as an educational-institution\nrequester so that she would have to pay only the reduced fees.\nAs to the other, Sack challenged the Department’s withholding\nof the requested polygraph reports. The District Court\ngranted summary judgment to the Department of Defense.\nThe Court concluded that Sack was not an\neducational-institution requester entitled to reduced fees. And\nthe Court ruled that the polygraph reports were exempt under\nFOIA Exemption 7(E).\n\n                              II\n\n   The first question in this case is whether FOIA requests\nmade by students to further their coursework or other\n\f                                  4\nschool-sponsored activities are requests made by an\n“educational institution.”\n\n                                 A\n\n    At the outset, we must describe the relevant statutory and\nregulatory provisions regarding fees for FOIA requests.\nBuckle up.\n\n    FOIA directs agencies to charge “fees applicable to the\nprocessing of requests.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i). Fees\nmay include charges for document search, document\nduplication, and document review.\n\n    The category of the FOIA requester determines the kinds\nof fees that may be charged. FOIA establishes three\ncategories of requesters.\n\n     The first category covers commercial requesters.\nAgencies may charge such commercial requesters “reasonable\nstandard charges for document search, duplication, and\nreview.” Id. § 552 (a)(4)(A)(ii)(I).\n\n     The second category covers noncommercial requests\nmade by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific\ninstitutions, and representatives of the news media. Agencies\nmay charge requesters in the second category only for\ndocument duplication. Id. § 552 (a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). 2\n\n\n    2\n        The relevant FOIA provision provides: “[F]ees shall be\nlimited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication\nwhen records are not sought for commercial use and the request is\nmade by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution,\nwhose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a representative\nof the news media.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).\n\f                                  5\n    The third category includes all other requesters.\nAgencies may charge those requesters for document search and\nduplication. Id. § 552 (a)(4)(A)(ii)(III).\n\n     Here, Sack clearly does not fall within the first category.\nThe question is whether Sack falls within the second\n“educational institution” category, or instead falls within the\nthird “other” category. 3 This question matters because, to\nreiterate, educational-institution requesters need to pay only\nthe costs for document duplication but not the costs for\ndocument search.\n\n     FOIA directs agencies to “promulgate regulations”\nspecifying “the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of\nrequests . . . and establishing procedures and guidelines for\ndetermining when such fees should be waived or reduced.”\nId. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i). The statute further provides: “Such\nschedule shall conform to the guidelines which shall be\npromulgated . . . by the Director of the Office of Management\nand Budget and which shall provide for a uniform schedule of\nfees for all agencies.” Id. 4\n\n    3\n         In addition to the provisions setting out the requester\ncategories, a separate FOIA provision not at issue in this case directs\nagencies to waive or reduce otherwise applicable fees “if disclosure\nof the information is in the public interest because it is likely to\ncontribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or\nactivities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial\ninterest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). That fee\nwaiver provision is focused not on the nature of the requester but on\nthe nature of the request. See Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d\n1108, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n    4\n        FOIA requires agencies – including the Department – to\nconform to OMB’s Guidelines pertaining only to fee schedules. In\nother words, the law does not expressly require that agencies adhere\nto OMB’s Guidelines regarding requester categorization. 5 U.S.C.\n\f                               6\n\n     FOIA does not define the term “educational institution”\napart from limiting it to those institutions “whose purpose is\nscholarly or scientific research.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).\nDepartment of Defense regulations supply a more\ncomprehensive definition: “The term ‘educational institution’\nrefers to a pre-school, a public or private elementary or\nsecondary school, an institution of graduate high education, an\ninstitution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of\nprofessional education, and an institution of vocational\neducation, which operates a program or programs of scholarly\nresearch.” 32 C.F.R. § 286.28(e)(4).\n\n     Consistent with the statute’s directive to follow OMB\nGuidelines, the Department of Defense has derived its\ndefinition of “educational institution” from the Office of\nManagement and Budget’s Fee Schedule and Guidelines,\nwhich define “educational institution” in the same terms. 52\nFed. Reg. 10,012, 10,014 (1987).\n\n     But who within the educational institution qualifies for\nreduced fees when they make a FOIA request? The\nDepartment of Defense regulations do not say. But the OMB\nGuidelines add further detail on that point. The Guidelines\nstate that “agencies should be prepared to evaluate requests on\nan individual basis when requesters can demonstrate that the\nrequest is from an institution that is within the category, that\nthe institution has a program of scholarly research, and that the\ndocuments sought are in furtherance of the institution’s\nprogram of scholarly research and not for a commercial use.”\n\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(A)(i). We assume solely for the sake of argument that\nOMB may establish guidelines for determining a requester’s fee\ncategory. Even so, those guidelines must be consistent with the\nstatute, the question we explore in Part II. B.\n\f                                7\nId. The Guidelines also direct agencies to “ensure that it is\napparent from the nature of the request that it serves a scholarly\nresearch goal of the institution, rather than an individual goal.”\nId.\n\n     To help agencies apply what OMB calls the “institutional\nversus individual test,” the Guidelines provide a few examples\nand make clear that a teacher may be eligible for reduced fees:\nA “request from a professor of geology at a State university for\nrecords relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the\nDepartment of Geology, could be presumed to be from an\neducational institution.” Id. By contrast, a “request from the\nsame person for drug information from the Food and Drug\nAdministration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is\nwriting would not be presumed to be an institutional request,\nregardless of whether it was written on institutional\nstationary.” Id.\n\n     The OMB Guidelines also speak to student requests. The\nGuidelines purport to say that the “institutional versus\nindividual test” applies to “student requests as well” as teacher\nrequests. Id. But the Guidelines then turn around and say\nthat student requests to further coursework do not qualify as\neducational-institution requests: “A student who makes a\nrequest in furtherance of the completion of a course of\ninstruction is carrying out an individual research goal and the\nrequest would not qualify . . . .” Id. That lone statement in\nthe OMB Guidelines, if consistent with the statute and\notherwise binding in this case, would obviously mean that Sack\ncould not qualify as an educational-institution requester. Not\nsurprisingly, in denying Sack’s request to be categorized as an\neducational-institution requester, the Government relied\nheavily on that OMB Guideline.\n\f                                8\n                                B\n\n     We now must decide whether FOIA requests made by\nstudents to further their coursework or other school-sponsored\nactivities are requests made by an “educational institution.”\nTo our surprise, no court of appeals has apparently decided that\nquestion in a published opinion.\n\n    In common parlance, the term “educational institution” is\nsynonymous with “school.” See National Security Archive v.\nDepartment of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1383 (D.C. Cir. 1989)\n(“The ordinary meaning of the term ‘educational institution’ is\n‘school.’”). According to Black’s Law Dictionary, an\neducational institution is a “school, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other educational facility, though not necessarily\na chartered institution.” (10th ed. 2014).\n\n     But who within a school is part of the school for FOIA\npurposes? At first blush, one might think that the term\n“educational institution” in FOIA includes neither teachers nor\nstudents, but refers only to the officers of the institution who\nspeak officially for the institution – for example, the president,\nprovost, or dean of a university. But that narrow category\nwould make no sense in the context of FOIA, which\ncontemplates researchers at educational institutions seeking\ninformation from the Government. Indeed, the statute\ncharacterizes an “educational institution” as an institution\n“whose purpose is scholarly . . . research.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).     The members of an educational\ninstitution likely to submit regular FOIA requests in pursuit of\nscholarly research are obviously not the president, provost, or\ndean of an educational institution. Rather, they are the\nteachers and students at the school.\n\f                               9\n    Not surprisingly, therefore, the Government has long\ndetermined that teachers at educational institutions may\nqualify as educational-institution requesters entitled to reduced\nfees under FOIA. But the Government has distinguished\nstudents from teachers and said that students who seek\ndocuments to further their coursework or other\nschool-sponsored activities do not ordinarily qualify as\neducational-institution requesters and are not eligible for\nreduced fees.\n\n     We thus must decide whether the statutory term\n“educational institution” is properly read, as the Government\nreads it, to include teachers but exclude students from the\ncategory of preferred requesters who are eligible for reduced\nfees.    We conclude that the Government’s reading is\ninconsistent with the statute.        Indeed, we think the\nGovernment’s reading makes little sense at all.\n\n     Dictionaries generally define “school” to encompass\nstudents as well as teachers. See, e.g., The American Heritage\nDictionary of the English Language (5th ed. 2011) (defining\n“school” as, among other things, the “student body of an\neducational institution”). Like teachers, students do research,\nseek background information for paper topics, gather primary\ndocuments, write papers, publish, and contribute to the\ndevelopment and dissemination of knowledge within the\nschool and to the outside world. They do so in order to further\ntheir coursework or other school-sponsored activities.\nStudents often seek access to government information to\npursue their particular research interests. And students often\nlack the money (or would be unwilling to spend it) to pay the\nextra fees that would be required for their FOIA requests if\nthey were denied classification as an educational institution.\n\f                               10\n     It would be a strange reading of this broad and general\nstatutory language – which draws no distinction between\nteachers and students – to exempt teachers from paying full\nFOIA fees but to force students with presumably fewer\nfinancial means to pay full freight.\n\n     To justify excluding students from the category of\neducational-institution requesters, the Government cites a\nsnippet of legislative history. But the snippet does not support\nthe Government’s interpretation. During the legislative\ndebates, Senator Leahy, the sponsor of the bill amending FOIA\nto limit fees for educational-institution requesters, stated: “A\nrequest made by a professor or other member of the\nprofessional staff of an educational or noncommercial\nscientific institution should be presumed to have been made by\nthe institution.” 132 Cong. Rec. S14,298 (daily ed. Sept. 30,\n1986) (statement of Sen. Patrick Leahy). Pointing to Senator\nLeahy’s statement, the Government seems to seize on what it\nperceives to be the statement’s negative implication: that a\nrequest by a student should be presumed not to have been made\nby the educational institution. We do not think that the\nclaimed negative implication follows from Senator Leahy’s\naffirmative statement. The Senator said nothing one way or\nanother about students. And given that students and teachers\nare essential elements of educational institutions, it seems just\nas likely, if not more so, that Senator Leahy would have wanted\nto make reduced fees available for students as well as teachers.\n\n     In any event, we must focus foremost on the text of the\nstatute. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n545 U.S. 546, 567 (2005). And the text of the statute refers to\n“educational institutions” without drawing a line between\nteachers and students.\n\f                               11\n     In defense of its position here, the Government also points\nto an OMB Guideline. The Guideline states: “A student who\nmakes a request in furtherance of the completion of a course of\ninstruction is carrying out an individual research goal and the\nrequest would not qualify” as a request made by an educational\ninstitution. 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,014.\n\n    But the Government’s reliance on the OMB Guideline just\nbegs the question of whether the Guideline itself is consistent\nwith the statute. To begin with, the Government does not\nclaim that the OMB Guideline is entitled to Chevron deference,\npresumably because OMB is not the only agency that\nadministers FOIA. See, e.g., DeNaples v. Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, 706 F.3d 481, 487-88 (D.C. Cir.\n2013) (citing Bowen v. American Hospital Association, 476\nU.S. 610, 642 n.30 (1986)); Proffitt v. Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp., 200 F.3d 855, 860 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n     In our view, OMB’s rule for student requests is\ninconsistent with the statute. FOIA refers broadly to an\n“educational institution.” As we have explained, we see no\ngood basis in the text or context of FOIA to draw a line here\nbetween the teachers and students within the educational\ninstitution. The Guideline’s ipse dixit distinction of students\nfrom teachers is entirely unexplained and unpersuasive. The\nGuideline says that a geology teacher seeking information\nabout soil erosion to support her research is entitled to reduced\nfees. But why not the geology student seeking the same\ninformation for the same reason? Crickets. We discern no\nmeaningful distinction for purposes of this statute between the\ngeology teacher and the geology student.\n\n     We recognize that OMB may (for good reason) want to\nhelp fill and replenish the Government’s coffers. And OMB\ntherefore may want to extract as much money as possible from\n\f                               12\nthose who make FOIA requests. OMB may also want to\ndiscourage further FOIA requests to alleviate the burden on\nalready grossly overburdened FOIA offices in the Executive\nBranch. But this statute, as we read it, does not empower the\nGovernment to pursue fiscal balance or provide relief for the\nFOIA bureaucracy on the backs of students. The statutory\ntext and context lead us to this simple conclusion: If teachers\ncan qualify for reduced fees, so can students.\n\n     To be clear, to qualify for reduced fees as an educational\ninstitution, the requester – whether teacher or student – must\nseek the information in connection with his or her role at the\neducational institution. In other words, the requester may not\nseek the information for personal or commercial use. Just as a\nteacher’s ordinary role at an educational institution is to teach,\nresearch, and produce scholarly works, a student’s role at an\neducational institution is, at least in part, to pursue coursework\nor other school-sponsored activities. A request from either a\nteacher or a student seeking information that would help her\nwrite a murder mystery or enhance her personal stock portfolio\npresumably has no connection to the requester’s role at an\neducational institution and would not justify reduced fees.\n\n     With that in mind, a government agency may seek some\nassurance that the student is submitting the FOIA request to\nfurther coursework or other school-sponsored activities. For\nexample, a FOIA request submitted with a copy of a student ID\nor other reasonable identification of status as an enrolled\nstudent in the school – together with a copy of a syllabus, a\nletter from a professor, or the like – should suffice. To be\nclear, we do not intend that list as exhaustive. We caution\nagencies against requiring hard-to-obtain verifications that will\nhave the practical effect of deterring or turning away otherwise\nvalid student FOIA requests.\n\f                              13\n     In sum, Sack was an educational-institution requester\nentitled to reduced FOIA fees.\n\n                              III\n\n     We turn next to the Exemption 7(E) issue. Citing that\nexemption, the Department of Defense denied Sack’s request\nfor various Department reports about polygraph examinations.\n\n     To withhold documents under Exemption 7, the\nGovernment must make a threshold showing that the “records\nor information” were “compiled for law enforcement\npurposes.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7); see also, e.g., Public\nEmployees for Environmental Responsibility v. U.S. Section,\nInternational Boundary and Water Commission, U.S.-Mexico,\n740 F.3d 195, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2014). On top of that, the\nGovernment must demonstrate that production of such\n“records or information” would cause at least one of the\nspecific harms described in the lettered subsections of\nExemption 7. Under Exemption 7(E), the Government must\ndemonstrate (i) that the withheld records or information\n“would disclose techniques and procedures for law\nenforcement investigations” and (ii) that their disclosure would\nreasonably “risk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(7)(E); see also Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 41-42\n(D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n     We conclude that the polygraph reports at issue here meet\nthe threshold requirement of FOIA Exemption 7, as well as\nboth subsidiary requirements specific to Exemption 7(E).\n\n     First, the reports about polygraph use were compiled for\nlaw enforcement purposes. Exemption 7 uses the term “law\nenforcement” to describe “the act of enforcing the law, both\ncivil and criminal.” Public Employees for Environmental\n\f                               14\nResponsibility, 740 F.3d at 203. Concurring in Milner, Justice\nAlito persuasively explained that the “ordinary understanding\nof law enforcement includes . . . proactive steps designed to\nprevent criminal activity and to maintain security.” Milner v.\nDepartment of the Navy, 131 S. Ct. 1259, 1272 (2011) (Alito,\nJ., concurring); see also Public Employees for Environmental\nResponsibility, 740 F.3d at 203. The reports at issue in this\ncase assist law enforcement agencies in taking “proactive\nsteps” to deter illegal activity and ensure national security. As\nthe Government notes, law enforcement agencies use\npolygraphs to test the credibility of witnesses and criminal\ndefendants. Those agencies also use polygraphs to “screen\napplicants for security clearances so that they may be deemed\nsuitable for work in critical law enforcement, defense, and\nintelligence collection roles.” Declaration of Alesia Y.\nWilliams, Defense Intelligence Agency, Chief of FOIA\nServices Section, at Joint Appendix 226. In Morley v. CIA,\nwe stated: “Background investigations conducted to assess an\napplicant’s qualification, such as . . . clearance and\ninvestigatory processes, inherently relate to law enforcement.”\n508 F.3d 1108, 1128-29 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n     The Government has satisfactorily explained how\npolygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes. It\nhas also explained how the reports assessing the efficacy of\nthose examinations and identifying needed fixes likewise serve\nlaw enforcement purposes. Put simply, the reports help\nensure that law enforcement officers optimally use an\nimportant law enforcement tool. The reports were compiled\nfor law enforcement purposes.\n\n    Second, the reports contain information about techniques\nand procedures for law enforcement investigations. As the\nGovernment points out, the reports detail whether a particular\n\f                              15\nagency’s polygraph procedures and techniques are effective.\nThe reports identify strengths and weaknesses of particular\npolygraph programs. In describing the effectiveness of\npolygraph techniques and procedures, the reports necessarily\nwould disclose information about the underlying techniques\nand procedures themselves, including when the agencies are\nlikely to employ them.\n\n     Third, release of the requested reports could reasonably\nrisk circumvention of the law. As the Government explained\nin its Vaughn index responding to Sack’s request, the reports\nidentify deficiencies in law enforcement agencies’ polygraph\nprograms. Their release could enable criminal suspects,\nemployees with ill intentions, and others to subvert polygraph\nexaminations.\n\n     Even if some portions of the reports may be exempt under\nExemption 7(E), Sack maintains in the alternative that other\nportions of the reports were “reasonably segregable” and so\nshould have been released. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). FOIA\nrequires that any “reasonably segregable portion of a record\nshall be provided to any person requesting such record after\ndeletion of the portions which are exempt.” Id. Courts may\nrely on agency affidavits to determine that documents withheld\npursuant to a valid exemption contain no reasonably\nsegregable information. See Armstrong v. Executive Office of\nthe President, 97 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n     Here, the District Court concluded that the release of any\npart of the reports – whether pertaining to the strengths of\npolygraphs, their weaknesses, or anything else – would create\n“at least a risk that subversive individuals will be armed with\nadvanced knowledge of the procedures used by the United\nStates to screen applicants for sensitive employment positions\nand security clearances.” Sack v. Department of Defense, 6 F.\n\f                               16\nSupp. 3d 78, 91 (D.D.C. 2013). For that reason, the District\nCourt stated that the reports could be fully withheld. Our case\nlaw is not crystal clear on our standard of review of a district\ncourt’s substantive segregability determination. Compare\nPowell v. Bureau of Prisons, 927 F.2d 1239, 1243 n.9 (D.C.\nCir. 1991) (rejecting abuse of discretion standard when\nreviewing substantive determination of segregability), with\nBoyd v. Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, 475\nF.3d 381, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (applying abuse of discretion\nstandard to segregability decision), and Johnson v. Executive\nOffice for U.S. Attorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 777 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(perceiving “no error” without establishing standard of\nreview). But regardless of whether our review here is\ndeferential or de novo, we would reach the same result because\nwe agree with the District Court’s segregability determination.\n\n                               IV\n\n     One final bit of housekeeping: Before this suit, Sack\nfiled a separate FOIA suit against the CIA, the Department of\nDefense, and three other agencies. Pursuant to Rule 21 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District Court in that case\ndismissed the claims against all of the non-CIA defendants and\nstated that Sack would have to refile separate lawsuits against\neach agency. Sack’s case against the CIA then went forward,\nand she refiled this separate suit against the Department of\nDefense. Sack now seeks review of the order in the prior case\ndismissing the non-CIA defendants. Because that order\ndismissed claims from a case not before us in this appeal, we\nlack jurisdiction to review the order.\n\n                            * * *\n\n    Sack was eligible for the reduced fees available to\neducational-institution requesters. We therefore reverse the\n\f                              17\njudgment of the District Court on the FOIA fees issue. We\naffirm the judgment of the District Court in all other respects,\nincluding the Exemption 7(E) issue.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f",

Those fees can be significant –\nin this case about $900 – and can deter or prevent citizens from\nmaking FOIA requests.\n\n      By statute, educational institutions are eligible for\nreduced fees when they make FOIA requests.                   The\nGovernment has long determined that teachers who make\nFOIA requests are eligible for those reduced fees because\nteachers are part of an educational institution. But at the same\ntime, the Government has determined that students who make\nFOIA requests are not eligible for those reduced fees because\nthey are supposedly not part of an educational institution.\n\n     We disagree with the Government’s slicing of the term\n“educational institution.” If teachers can qualify for reduced\nfees, so can students. Students who make FOIA requests to\nfurther their coursework or other school-sponsored activities\nare eligible for reduced fees under FOIA because students, like\nteachers, are part of an educational institution. The student\ninvolved in this case, Kathryn Sack, therefore is eligible for\nreduced fees for her FOIA requests. We reverse the contrary\njudgment of the District Court on that question, and affirm in\nall other respects.\n\n                               I\n\n    While pursuing her Ph.D. in Politics at the University of\nVirginia, Kathryn Sack submitted FOIA requests to the\nDepartment of Defense. 1 Sack sought Department reports\nabout its use of polygraph examinations, as well as related\n\n   1\n         To be precise, Sack submitted the requests to multiple\nagencies within the Department. For ease of reference, we will\nrefer to the agencies as “the Department.”\n\f                              3\ndocuments about those examinations.          Sack told the\nDepartment that she intended to use the requested information\nfor her dissertation on polygraph bias.\n\n    Sack asked the Department to categorize her as an\neducational-institution requester. Under FOIA, government\nagencies may charge fees for processing FOIA requests. But\nFOIA limits the fees that an agency may charge for processing\nFOIA requests made by an educational institution.\n\n    For one batch of Sack’s requests, the Department of\nDefense     refused      to    categorize    Sack      as    an\neducational-institution requester and required her to pay about\n$900 to conduct the search. For another batch of Sack’s\nrequests, the Department conducted a search and reviewed\nresponsive documents, but the Department informed Sack that\nthe documents were exempt from disclosure under FOIA\nExemption (7)(E).\n\n    Sack filed a lawsuit challenging the Department’s\nhandling of those two batches of requests. As to the first,\nSack asked to be categorized as an educational-institution\nrequester so that she would have to pay only the reduced fees.\nAs to the other, Sack challenged the Department’s withholding\nof the requested polygraph reports. The District Court\ngranted summary judgment to the Department of Defense.\nThe Court concluded that Sack was not an\neducational-institution requester entitled to reduced fees. And\nthe Court ruled that the polygraph reports were exempt under\nFOIA Exemption 7(E).\n\n                              II\n\n   The first question in this case is whether FOIA requests\nmade by students to further their coursework or other\n\f                                  4\nschool-sponsored activities are requests made by an\n“educational institution.”\n\n                                 A\n\n    At the outset, we must describe the relevant statutory and\nregulatory provisions regarding fees for FOIA requests.\nBuckle up.\n\n    FOIA directs agencies to charge “fees applicable to the\nprocessing of requests.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i). Fees\nmay include charges for document search, document\nduplication, and document review.\n\n    The category of the FOIA requester determines the kinds\nof fees that may be charged. FOIA establishes three\ncategories of requesters.\n\n     The first category covers commercial requesters.\nAgencies may charge such commercial requesters “reasonable\nstandard charges for document search, duplication, and\nreview.” Id. § 552 (a)(4)(A)(ii)(I).\n\n     The second category covers noncommercial requests\nmade by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific\ninstitutions, and representatives of the news media. Agencies\nmay charge requesters in the second category only for\ndocument duplication. Id. § 552 (a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). 2\n\n\n    2\n        The relevant FOIA provision provides: “[F]ees shall be\nlimited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication\nwhen records are not sought for commercial use and the request is\nmade by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution,\nwhose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a representative\nof the news media.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).\n\f                                  5\n    The third category includes all other requesters.\nAgencies may charge those requesters for document search and\nduplication. Id. § 552 (a)(4)(A)(ii)(III).\n\n     Here, Sack clearly does not fall within the first category.\nThe question is whether Sack falls within the second\n“educational institution” category, or instead falls within the\nthird “other” category. 3 This question matters because, to\nreiterate, educational-institution requesters need to pay only\nthe costs for document duplication but not the costs for\ndocument search.\n\n     FOIA directs agencies to “promulgate regulations”\nspecifying “the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of\nrequests . . . and establishing procedures and guidelines for\ndetermining when such fees should be waived or reduced.”\nId. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i). The statute further provides: “Such\nschedule shall conform to the guidelines which shall be\npromulgated . . . by the Director of the Office of Management\nand Budget and which shall provide for a uniform schedule of\nfees for all agencies.” Id. 4\n\n    3\n         In addition to the provisions setting out the requester\ncategories, a separate FOIA provision not at issue in this case directs\nagencies to waive or reduce otherwise applicable fees “if disclosure\nof the information is in the public interest because it is likely to\ncontribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or\nactivities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial\ninterest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). That fee\nwaiver provision is focused not on the nature of the requester but on\nthe nature of the request. See Cause of Action v. FTC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n    4\n        FOIA requires agencies – including the Department – to\nconform to OMB’s Guidelines pertaining only to fee schedules. In\nother words, the law does not expressly require that agencies adhere\nto OMB’s Guidelines regarding requester categorization. 5 U.S.C.\n\f                               6\n\n     FOIA does not define the term “educational institution”\napart from limiting it to those institutions “whose purpose is\nscholarly or scientific research.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).\nDepartment of Defense regulations supply a more\ncomprehensive definition: “The term ‘educational institution’\nrefers to a pre-school, a public or private elementary or\nsecondary school, an institution of graduate high education, an\ninstitution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of\nprofessional education, and an institution of vocational\neducation, which operates a program or programs of scholarly\nresearch.” 32 C.F.R. § 286.28(e)(4).\n\n     Consistent with the statute’s directive to follow OMB\nGuidelines, the Department of Defense has derived its\ndefinition of “educational institution” from the Office of\nManagement and Budget’s Fee Schedule and Guidelines,\nwhich define “educational institution” in the same terms. 52\nFed. Reg. 10,012, 10,014 (1987).\n\n     But who within the educational institution qualifies for\nreduced fees when they make a FOIA request? The\nDepartment of Defense regulations do not say. But the OMB\nGuidelines add further detail on that point. The Guidelines\nstate that “agencies should be prepared to evaluate requests on\nan individual basis when requesters can demonstrate that the\nrequest is from an institution that is within the category, that\nthe institution has a program of scholarly research, and that the\ndocuments sought are in furtherance of the institution’s\nprogram of scholarly research and not for a commercial use.”\n\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(A)(i). We assume solely for the sake of argument that\nOMB may establish guidelines for determining a requester’s fee\ncategory. Even so, those guidelines must be consistent with the\nstatute, the question we explore in Part II. B.\n\f                                7\nId. The Guidelines also direct agencies to “ensure that it is\napparent from the nature of the request that it serves a scholarly\nresearch goal of the institution, rather than an individual goal.”\nId.\n\n     To help agencies apply what OMB calls the “institutional\nversus individual test,” the Guidelines provide a few examples\nand make clear that a teacher may be eligible for reduced fees:\nA “request from a professor of geology at a State university for\nrecords relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the\nDepartment of Geology, could be presumed to be from an\neducational institution.” Id. By contrast, a “request from the\nsame person for drug information from the Food and Drug\nAdministration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is\nwriting would not be presumed to be an institutional request,\nregardless of whether it was written on institutional\nstationary.” Id.\n\n     The OMB Guidelines also speak to student requests. The\nGuidelines purport to say that the “institutional versus\nindividual test” applies to “student requests as well” as teacher\nrequests. Id. But the Guidelines then turn around and say\nthat student requests to further coursework do not qualify as\neducational-institution requests: “A student who makes a\nrequest in furtherance of the completion of a course of\ninstruction is carrying out an individual research goal and the\nrequest would not qualify . . . .” Id. That lone statement in\nthe OMB Guidelines, if consistent with the statute and\notherwise binding in this case, would obviously mean that Sack\ncould not qualify as an educational-institution requester. Not\nsurprisingly, in denying Sack’s request to be categorized as an\neducational-institution requester, the Government relied\nheavily on that OMB Guideline.\n\f                                8\n                                B\n\n     We now must decide whether FOIA requests made by\nstudents to further their coursework or other school-sponsored\nactivities are requests made by an “educational institution.”\nTo our surprise, no court of appeals has apparently decided that\nquestion in a published opinion.\n\n    In common parlance, the term “educational institution” is\nsynonymous with “school.” See National Security Archive v.\nDepartment of Defense, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526958\"><a href=\"/opinion/526958/national-security-archive-v-us-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1383 (D.C. Cir. 1989)\n(“The ordinary meaning of the term ‘educational institution’ is\n‘school.’”). According to Black’s Law Dictionary, an\neducational institution is a “school, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other educational facility, though not necessarily\na chartered institution.” (10th ed. 2014).\n\n     But who within a school is part of the school for FOIA\npurposes? At first blush, one might think that the term\n“educational institution” in FOIA includes neither teachers nor\nstudents, but refers only to the officers of the institution who\nspeak officially for the institution – for example, the president,\nprovost, or dean of a university. But that narrow category\nwould make no sense in the context of FOIA, which\ncontemplates researchers at educational institutions seeking\ninformation from the Government. Indeed, the statute\ncharacterizes an “educational institution” as an institution\n“whose purpose is scholarly . . . research.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).     The members of an educational\ninstitution likely to submit regular FOIA requests in pursuit of\nscholarly research are obviously not the president, provost, or\ndean of an educational institution. Rather, they are the\nteachers and students at the school.\n\f                               9\n    Not surprisingly, therefore, the Government has long\ndetermined that teachers at educational institutions may\nqualify as educational-institution requesters entitled to reduced\nfees under FOIA. But the Government has distinguished\nstudents from teachers and said that students who seek\ndocuments to further their coursework or other\nschool-sponsored activities do not ordinarily qualify as\neducational-institution requesters and are not eligible for\nreduced fees.\n\n     We thus must decide whether the statutory term\n“educational institution” is properly read, as the Government\nreads it, to include teachers but exclude students from the\ncategory of preferred requesters who are eligible for reduced\nfees.    We conclude that the Government’s reading is\ninconsistent with the statute.        Indeed, we think the\nGovernment’s reading makes little sense at all.\n\n     Dictionaries generally define “school” to encompass\nstudents as well as teachers. See, e.g., The American Heritage\nDictionary of the English Language (5th ed. 2011) (defining\n“school” as, among other things, the “student body of an\neducational institution”). Like teachers, students do research,\nseek background information for paper topics, gather primary\ndocuments, write papers, publish, and contribute to the\ndevelopment and dissemination of knowledge within the\nschool and to the outside world. They do so in order to further\ntheir coursework or other school-sponsored activities.\nStudents often seek access to government information to\npursue their particular research interests. And students often\nlack the money (or would be unwilling to spend it) to pay the\nextra fees that would be required for their FOIA requests if\nthey were denied classification as an educational institution.\n\f                               10\n     It would be a strange reading of this broad and general\nstatutory language – which draws no distinction between\nteachers and students – to exempt teachers from paying full\nFOIA fees but to force students with presumably fewer\nfinancial means to pay full freight.\n\n     To justify excluding students from the category of\neducational-institution requesters, the Government cites a\nsnippet of legislative history. But the snippet does not support\nthe Government’s interpretation. During the legislative\ndebates, Senator Leahy, the sponsor of the bill amending FOIA\nto limit fees for educational-institution requesters, stated: “A\nrequest made by a professor or other member of the\nprofessional staff of an educational or noncommercial\nscientific institution should be presumed to have been made by\nthe institution.” 132 Cong. Rec. S14,298 (daily ed. Sept. 30,\n1986) (statement of Sen. Patrick Leahy). Pointing to Senator\nLeahy’s statement, the Government seems to seize on what it\nperceives to be the statement’s negative implication: that a\nrequest by a student should be presumed not to have been made\nby the educational institution. We do not think that the\nclaimed negative implication follows from Senator Leahy’s\naffirmative statement. The Senator said nothing one way or\nanother about students. And given that students and teachers\nare essential elements of educational institutions, it seems just\nas likely, if not more so, that Senator Leahy would have wanted\nto make reduced fees available for students as well as teachers.\n\n     In any event, we must focus foremost on the text of the\nstatute. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799986\"><a href=\"/opinion/799986/exxon-mobil-corp-v-allapattah-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 (2005). And the text of the statute refers to\n“educational institutions” without drawing a line between\nteachers and students.\n\f                               11\n     In defense of its position here, the Government also points\nto an OMB Guideline. The Guideline states: “A student who\nmakes a request in furtherance of the completion of a course of\ninstruction is carrying out an individual research goal and the\nrequest would not qualify” as a request made by an educational\ninstitution. 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,014.\n\n    But the Government’s reliance on the OMB Guideline just\nbegs the question of whether the Guideline itself is consistent\nwith the statute. To begin with, the Government does not\nclaim that the OMB Guideline is entitled to Chevron deference,\npresumably because OMB is not the only agency that\nadministers FOIA. See, e.g., DeNaples v. Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487-88 (D.C. Cir.\n2013) (citing Bowen v. American Hospital Association, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111685\"><a href=\"/opinion/111685/bowen-v-american-hospital-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 n.30 (1986)); Proffitt v.

Cir. 2000).\n\n     In our view, OMB’s rule for student requests is\ninconsistent with the statute. FOIA refers broadly to an\n“educational institution.” As we have explained, we see no\ngood basis in the text or context of FOIA to draw a line here\nbetween the teachers and students within the educational\ninstitution. The Guideline’s ipse dixit distinction of students\nfrom teachers is entirely unexplained and unpersuasive. The\nGuideline says that a geology teacher seeking information\nabout soil erosion to support her research is entitled to reduced\nfees. But why not the geology student seeking the same\ninformation for the same reason? Crickets. We discern no\nmeaningful distinction for purposes of this statute between the\ngeology teacher and the geology student.\n\n     We recognize that OMB may (for good reason) want to\nhelp fill and replenish the Government’s coffers. And OMB\ntherefore may want to extract as much money as possible from\n\f                               12\nthose who make FOIA requests. OMB may also want to\ndiscourage further FOIA requests to alleviate the burden on\nalready grossly overburdened FOIA offices in the Executive\nBranch. But this statute, as we read it, does not empower the\nGovernment to pursue fiscal balance or provide relief for the\nFOIA bureaucracy on the backs of students. The statutory\ntext and context lead us to this simple conclusion: If teachers\ncan qualify for reduced fees, so can students.\n\n     To be clear, to qualify for reduced fees as an educational\ninstitution, the requester – whether teacher or student – must\nseek the information in connection with his or her role at the\neducational institution. In other words, the requester may not\nseek the information for personal or commercial use. Just as a\nteacher’s ordinary role at an educational institution is to teach,\nresearch, and produce scholarly works, a student’s role at an\neducational institution is, at least in part, to pursue coursework\nor other school-sponsored activities. A request from either a\nteacher or a student seeking information that would help her\nwrite a murder mystery or enhance her personal stock portfolio\npresumably has no connection to the requester’s role at an\neducational institution and would not justify reduced fees.\n\n     With that in mind, a government agency may seek some\nassurance that the student is submitting the FOIA request to\nfurther coursework or other school-sponsored activities. For\nexample, a FOIA request submitted with a copy of a student ID\nor other reasonable identification of status as an enrolled\nstudent in the school – together with a copy of a syllabus, a\nletter from a professor, or the like – should suffice. To be\nclear, we do not intend that list as exhaustive. We caution\nagencies against requiring hard-to-obtain verifications that will\nhave the practical effect of deterring or turning away otherwise\nvalid student FOIA requests.\n\f                              13\n     In sum, Sack was an educational-institution requester\nentitled to reduced FOIA fees.\n\n                              III\n\n     We turn next to the Exemption 7(E) issue. Citing that\nexemption, the Department of Defense denied Sack’s request\nfor various Department reports about polygraph examinations.\n\n     To withhold documents under Exemption 7, the\nGovernment must make a threshold showing that the “records\nor information” were “compiled for law enforcement\npurposes.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7); see also, e.g., Public\nEmployees for Environmental Responsibility v. U.S. Section,\nInternational Boundary and Water Commission, U.S.-Mexico,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2014). On top of that, the\nGovernment must demonstrate that production of such\n“records or information” would cause at least one of the\nspecific harms described in the lettered subsections of\nExemption 7. Under Exemption 7(E), the Government must\ndemonstrate (i) that the withheld records or information\n“would disclose techniques and procedures for law\nenforcement investigations” and (ii) that their disclosure would\nreasonably “risk circumvention of the law.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(7)(E); see also Blackwell v.

Cir. 2011).\n\n     We conclude that the polygraph reports at issue here meet\nthe threshold requirement of FOIA Exemption 7, as well as\nboth subsidiary requirements specific to Exemption 7(E).\n\n     First, the reports about polygraph use were compiled for\nlaw enforcement purposes. Exemption 7 uses the term “law\nenforcement” to describe “the act of enforcing the law, both\ncivil and criminal.” Public Employees for Environmental\n\f                               14\nResponsibility, 740 F.3d at 203. Concurring in Milner, Justice\nAlito persuasively explained that the “ordinary understanding\nof law enforcement includes . . . proactive steps designed to\nprevent criminal activity and to maintain security.” Milner v.\nDepartment of the Navy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"206187\"><a href=\"/opinion/206187/milner-v-department-of-navy/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1272 (2011) (Alito,\nJ., concurring); see also Public Employees for Environmental\nResponsibility, 740 F.3d at 203. The reports at issue in this\ncase assist law enforcement agencies in taking “proactive\nsteps” to deter illegal activity and ensure national security. As\nthe Government notes, law enforcement agencies use\npolygraphs to test the credibility of witnesses and criminal\ndefendants. Those agencies also use polygraphs to “screen\napplicants for security clearances so that they may be deemed\nsuitable for work in critical law enforcement, defense, and\nintelligence collection roles.” Declaration of Alesia Y.\nWilliams, Defense Intelligence Agency, Chief of FOIA\nServices Section, at Joint Appendix 226. In Morley v. CIA,\nwe stated: “Background investigations conducted to assess an\napplicant’s qualification, such as . . . clearance and\ninvestigatory processes, inherently relate to law enforcement.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187057\"><a href=\"/opinion/187057/morley-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1128-29 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n     The Government has satisfactorily explained how\npolygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes. It\nhas also explained how the reports assessing the efficacy of\nthose examinations and identifying needed fixes likewise serve\nlaw enforcement purposes. Put simply, the reports help\nensure that law enforcement officers optimally use an\nimportant law enforcement tool. The reports were compiled\nfor law enforcement purposes.\n\n    Second, the reports contain information about techniques\nand procedures for law enforcement investigations. As the\nGovernment points out, the reports detail whether a particular\n\f                              15\nagency’s polygraph procedures and techniques are effective.\nThe reports identify strengths and weaknesses of particular\npolygraph programs. In describing the effectiveness of\npolygraph techniques and procedures, the reports necessarily\nwould disclose information about the underlying techniques\nand procedures themselves, including when the agencies are\nlikely to employ them.\n\n     Third, release of the requested reports could reasonably\nrisk circumvention of the law. As the Government explained\nin its Vaughn index responding to Sack’s request, the reports\nidentify deficiencies in law enforcement agencies’ polygraph\nprograms. Their release could enable criminal suspects,\nemployees with ill intentions, and others to subvert polygraph\nexaminations.\n\n     Even if some portions of the reports may be exempt under\nExemption 7(E), Sack maintains in the alternative that other\nportions of the reports were “reasonably segregable” and so\nshould have been released. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). FOIA\nrequires that any “reasonably segregable portion of a record\nshall be provided to any person requesting such record after\ndeletion of the portions which are exempt.” Id. Courts may\nrely on agency affidavits to determine that documents withheld\npursuant to a valid exemption contain no reasonably\nsegregable information. See Armstrong v. Executive Office of\nthe President, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727298\"><a href=\"/opinion/727298/scott-armstrong-v-executive-office-of-the-president/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n     Here, the District Court concluded that the release of any\npart of the reports – whether pertaining to the strengths of\npolygraphs, their weaknesses, or anything else – would create\n“at least a risk that subversive individuals will be armed with\nadvanced knowledge of the procedures used by the United\nStates to screen applicants for sensitive employment positions\nand security clearances.” Sack v. Department of Defense, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span>\n\f                               <span class=\"page\">16</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nSupp. 3d 78, 91 (D.D.C. 2013). For that reason, the District\nCourt stated that the reports could be fully withheld. Our case\nlaw is not crystal clear on our standard of review of a district\ncourt’s substantive segregability determination. Compare\nPowell v. Bureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557298\"><a href=\"/opinion/557298/thomas-d-powell-v-united-states-bureau-of-prisons/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1243 n.9 (D.C.\nCir. 1991) (rejecting abuse of discretion standard when\nreviewing substantive determination of segregability), with\nBoyd v. Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186862\"><a href=\"/opinion/186862/boyd-willie-e-v-cr-div-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (D.C.

Executive\nOffice for U.S. Attorneys, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185805\"><a href=\"/opinion/185805/johnson-neil-v-exec-off-us-atty/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(perceiving “no error” without establishing standard of\nreview). But regardless of whether our review here is\ndeferential or de novo, we would reach the same result because\nwe agree with the District Court’s segregability determination.\n\n                               IV\n\n     One final bit of housekeeping: Before this suit, Sack\nfiled a separate FOIA suit against the CIA, the Department of\nDefense, and three other agencies. Pursuant to Rule 21 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District Court in that case\ndismissed the claims against all of the non-CIA defendants and\nstated that Sack would have to refile separate lawsuits against\neach agency. Sack’s case against the CIA then went forward,\nand she refiled this separate suit against the Department of\nDefense. Sack now seeks review of the order in the prior case\ndismissing the non-CIA defendants. Because that order\ndismissed claims from a case not before us in this appeal, we\nlack jurisdiction to review the order.\n\n                            * * *\n\n    Sack was eligible for the reduced fees available to\neducational-institution requesters. We therefore reverse the\n\f                              17\njudgment of the District Court on the FOIA fees issue. We\naffirm the judgment of the District Court in all other respects,\nincluding the Exemption 7(E) issue.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f</pre>",
