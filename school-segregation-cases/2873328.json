Kosik\n                  _______________________________________\n\n\n          Submitted For Possible Dismissal Under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)\n                                   March 3, 2005\n\n                Before: ALITO, McKEE and AMBRO, Circuit Judges\n\n                                (Filed: May 4, 2005 )\n\n\n                             _______________________\n\n                                     OPINION\n                             _______________________\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n     Appellant Rafael Bastista, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals an order of\n\fthe United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his\n\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. We will dismiss this\n\nappeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).1\n\n       In his habeas petition, Bastista states that he was charged with orchestrating an\n\nattack on another prisoner, and with fighting with that prisoner on a previous occasion. A\n\nhearing officer found Bastista guilty of both charges, and sanctioned him to disciplinary\n\nsegregation, and the loss of good-time credits and privileges. Bastista, who speaks\n\nSpanish, claims that he was denied due process because the charges were brought against\n\nhim without adequate notice in a language that he understood. He further contends that\n\nhe did not have an interpreter at one of his hearings, that the finding that he was guilty of\n\nfighting was not supported by valid evidence, and that he was denied the opportunity to\n\npresent evidence on his behalf.\n\n       The Government responded that the District Court should dismiss the petition\n\nbecause Bastista did not exhaust his administrative remedies. The Magistrate Judge\n\nagreed that Bastista was required to do so, but noted that the Government’s declaration\n\nattesting to Bastista’s failure to exhaust was unsigned and could not be considered, and\n\nthat it was unclear whether Bastista failed to exhaust. The Magistrate Judge directed the\n\nGovernment to file a supplemental response and provide copies of Bastista’s grievances\n\n\n\n\n   1\n    In District Court, Bastista filed documents using the name “Batista.” He has spelled\nhis name “Bastista” in documents filed in this Court, and the docket reflects this spelling.\n\n                                              2\n\fand appeals and responses thereto. The Magistrate Judge also directed Bastista to address\n\nthe issue of cause and prejudice in his reply in the event the District Court concluded that\n\nhe procedurally defaulted his claims.\n\n       The Government filed a supplemental response, but only provided the same\n\nunsigned declaration. The Magistrate Judge noted that Bastista did not disagree with the\n\ndeclaration, and concluded that his attempts to exhaust were insufficient because he did\n\nnot properly pursue his appeals to final review. The Magistrate Judge further found that\n\nBastista’s inability to speak English did not constitute cause to excuse his procedural\n\ndefault, and recommended the dismissal of the habeas petition. The District Court\n\nadopted the recommendation and dismissed the petition. This appeal followed.\n\n       A federal prisoner must exhaust his administrative remedies before petitioning for\n\na writ of habeas corpus pursuant to § 2241. Moscato v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 98\n\nF.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1996). We will not consider the unsigned declaration that the\n\nGovernment submitted to show that Bastista failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\n\nHowever, the two documents that Bastista provided to the District Court establish that he\n\ndid not exhaust. Regarding the charge of ordering the assault of another inmate, Bastista\n\nprovided the Regional Director’s decision denying his appeal of the finding of\n\nmisconduct. In the decision, the Regional Director stated that Bastista could appeal to the\n\nGeneral Counsel of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Bastista also provided the\n\nAdministrator of National Inmate Appeals’ response to his request for an expungement of\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fthe incident report related to this charge. In denying the request, the Administrator stated\n\nthat Bastista did not appeal the Regional Director’s denial of his appeal of the finding of\n\nmisconduct.\n\n       Regarding the fighting charge, the Regional Director stated in his decision denying\n\nBastista’s appeal of the finding that he ordered an attack, that he must separately appeal\n\nthe finding of misconduct for fighting. Bastista does not maintain that he ever did so.\n\nBastista’s submissions establish that he procedurally defaulted his due process claims\n\nrelated to the findings of misconduct. Thus, review of his habeas petition is barred absent\n\na showing of cause and prejudice to excuse the default. Moscato, 98 F.3d at 762.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that Bastista has not shown cause, or that “‘some\n\nobjective factor external to the defense impeded [his] efforts to comply with the [prison’s]\n\nprocedural rule.’” Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 193 (3d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).\n\nIn his objections to the Magistrate Judge’s report, Bastista argued that he does not speak\n\nEnglish, and he was not notified that his staff representative could assist him in filing an\n\nadministrative appeal. The District Court noted that the regulations do not require such\n\nassistance. Moreover, based upon Bastista’s demonstrated ability to represent himself,\n\nwe cannot conclude that his efforts to appeal the findings of misconduct were impeded by\n\na lack of staff assistance. See Bonilla v. Hurley, 370 F.3d 494, 498 (6th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 506 (2004) (finding prisoner’s unfamiliarly with English language\n\ninsufficient to establish cause to excuse a procedural default, and noting prisoner’s ability\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f    to file documents in state court).\n\n              Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n    § 1915(e)(2)(B).2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n1          Bastista’s Motion Requesting to File Appellate Brief is denied.\n\n                                                   5\n\f",
